    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I salute your faith, my Christian leaders,
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>our political leaders,
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>our law makers.
    <br>Thank you for your coming.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>We have many professionals.
    <br>All professionals, thank you for your faith. I salute you.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank you for your coming.
    <br>God is our Rewarder.
    <br>He will surely reward you today.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Let's bow down our heads for this opening prayer - it is a short prayer.
    <br>Lord Jesus,
    <br>cause us to be spiritually and mentally alert
    <br>in this time of meditation and prayer.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Let the people of God say 'Amen' !
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We have our leaders here today
    <br>and I want to believe that what God wants us to hear, to know is what we are going to hear today.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>GRIEVE NOT THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>This will quickly take us to the Book of Ephesians.
    <br>Ephesians 4
    <br>Unity and maturity in the body of Christ
    <br>"As a prisoner for the Lord,
    <br>then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling...
    <br>worthy of the calling you have received.
    <br>Be completely humble and gentle;
    <br>be patient,
    <br>bearing with one another in love.
    <br>Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace."
    <br>Verse 4
    <br>"There is one body and one Spirit,
    <br>just as we were called to one hope when you were called;
    <br>one Lord, one faith, one baptism."
    <br>Let's go to our proof text.
    <br>Ephesians 4:11
    <br>"So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists,
    <br>the pastors and teachers to equip his people for works of service
    <br>so that the body of Christ may be built up."
    <br>Well, I want to leave you here and getting home, take your reading from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>Yes, my people.
    <br>I have conducted several revival crusades.
    <br>I've witnessed the Spirit descend on a number of people but didn't stay.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Talking by my experience,
    <br>I have conducted many revivals outside my country.
    <br>I witnessed the Spirit descend on numbers of people
    <br>but did not stay, did not remain.
    <br>He does not stay when He is grieved.
    <br>This why we are here today.
    <br>We grieve the Holy Spirit
    <br>when you hold a grudge against a brother.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Are you sure you are not holding a grudge against anyone?
    <br>Before we start calling the Holy Ghost, are you sure you are not holding a grudge against anyone?
    <br>Are you sure you are not holding an offence?
    <br>You have no excuse.
    <br>Whether injustice or justice, whether you are right or wrong,
    <br>you have no excuse for holding an offence.
    <br>We pastors, we ministers of God,
    <br>say, "That man is a fake" and because of that, he is your enemy.
    <br>"That man does not preach the true Gospel of Christ" -
    <br>because of that, you keep him at a distance.
    <br>You say, "That pastor is very proud" - because of that, you don't want to hear anything about him.
    <br>Anytime they say, "Pastor so and so" -
    <br>"Oh my God! No, no, no, don't talk about that. That one is a devil".
    <br>When did we become a judge?
    <br>If we now turn to judge, who will judge us on the last day - we pastors?
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When we get offended, we do not realise that we are trapped.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>When we get offended, we do not realise that we are trapped.
    <br>How?
    <br>When we retain an offence in our heart,
    <br>we filter everything through it.
    <br>If I have an offence in my heart,
    <br>maybe somebody there I see as a devil is not a pastor -  because of that, I show that hatred.
    <br>And I'm standing here today.
    <br>I want to call, "In Jesus' name",
    <br>I will call Jesus' name through that offence.
    <br>When you retain an offence in your heart,
    <br>whether the person is proud or arrogant to you or is junior to you,
    <br>he has no respect for you as a big pastor, he's not a true minister or in whatever way,
    <br>like the Bible says, we have no excuse for holding an offence.
    <br>If we retain an offence in our heart, we filter everything we do and say through offence.
    <br>"How are you?" - through offence; "Hi" - through offence.
    <br>"In Jesus' name" - through offence; you sleep through offence.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>You have no excuse.
    <br>Your junior, being rude to you and you are holding an offence...
    <br>When we retain an offence in our heart,
    <br>we filter everything we do through it.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>We need a free spirit to contact God.
    <br>You need a free spirit to be in His presence.
    <br>What is a free spirit?
    <br>A free spirit is a spirit that is not locked up by sin.
    <br>A free spirit is a spirit that is not locked up by an offence.
    <br>Sin of outrage,
    <br>strifes,
    <br>bitterness,
    <br>anger,
    <br>hurt,
    <br>jealousy,
    <br>envy.
    <br>If any of these trap your spirit,
    <br>you cannot contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When your spirit is free, it's sensitive to the Spirit of God
    <br>but when your spirit is trapped by any of these,
    <br>when your spirit is locked by any of these - anger , bitterness, jealousy, hatred,
    <br>strife, outrage, resentment - it looses that sensitivity
    <br>and therefore, it is useless as an instrument.
    <br>You know our spirit is an instrument -
    <br>an instrument for the Holy Ghost,
    <br>an instrument for God
    <br>but if the instrument is useless, it is useless.
    <br>When we grieve the Holy Spirit,
    <br>you should not be surprised
    <br>if the Bible is not real to you any longer.
    <br>You should not be surprised
    <br>if the Bible is not real to you any longer.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>This is the Bible;
    <br>you are reading the Bible while holding an offence,
    <br>you are reading an event, history about God's Generals,
    <br>about things that happened during their times.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Reading the Bible while holding an offence -
    <br>you are reading literature.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Reading the Bible while holding an offence, holding grudges,
    <br>you are reading any other book that is not inspired by the Spirit of God.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Reading the Bible is reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In other words, we are carried along while reading the Bible.
    <br>We are carried along by the Holy Spirit while reading the Bible.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>When you are reading the Bible while holding an offence,
    <br>you are reading any other book that is not inspired by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Bible is the letter that is inspired by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The Bible and the Holy Spirit are inseparable.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Jesus said that His Word is Spirit and Life in John 6:63.
    <br>Let us ask ourselves a question:
    <br>How does one grieve the Holy Spirit?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>We grieve the Holy Spirit when we ignore Him.
    <br>We must give full attention to the Spirit.
    <br>We must give full attention to Him,
    <br>never indifferent to this sensitive Being.
    <br>He is not one of those things; He is the only thing.
    <br>Full attention.
    <br>When it is time to read the Bible, it is time for your life.
    <br>Every other thing, put it behind.
    <br>Attention!
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>You must read aloud and read to yourself
    <br>and insert your name where the message is personal with devotion
    <br>because it's a Book that sees you while reading it.
    <br>As you read, it reads you.
    <br>Two:
    <br>We grieve the Holy Spirit by forcing Him
    <br>to see and hear what is opposed to His Will
    <br>such as watching lustful programmes.
    <br>Our body is the temple of God.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Three:
    <br>We grieve the Holy Spirit by our pride.
    <br>Our pride is expressed in various ways.
    <br>Boasting of material things.
    <br>As we are here now, you will be looking at the time.
    <br>"No, I have to keep that appointment.
    <br>My customer is coming any moment from now.
    <br>I'm expecting my business partner. T.B. Joshua, you should do quick!
    <br>If you don't do quick , I will leave you here today!"
    <br>Boasting of material things when the Word of God,
    <br>the Spirit is the Creator of material things.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Many that are supposed to be here
    <br>have an appointment because of millions of dollars they need to get.
    <br>They compare millions of dollars with the Creator of millions of dollars.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>God's Word, a Spirit created the material things.
    <br>This proves that the Spirit is greater than material things.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Now, in summary,
    <br>if you are holding grudges,
    <br>if you are holding an offence,
    <br>because a man disappointed you,
    <br>or the man is a fake pastor or is very rude -
    <br>you don't want to see him,
    <br>you don't want to hear him,
    <br>anything about him, you don't want to hear -
    <br>it's a trap of the enemy to trap your spirit.
    <br>You have to be free so that your spirit can be free.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Right now, begin to reconcile as you are on the seat.
    <br>While you are sitting down, begin to reconcile.
    <br>Reconcile.
    <br>Say to the Lord, "I am free!"
    <br>Leave it for God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Through obedience, we grow in character.
    <br>When you obey, you grow in character.
    <br>Through obedience, we grow in character.
    <br>The trials and difficult circumstances we face are for our obedience to God.
    <br>Trials and difficult circumstances we face are for our obedience to God.
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>We pastors, we run from things that will bring strength to our lives.
    <br>We Christians, we run from things that will bring strength to our lives.
    <br>We need strength - strength of God.
    <br>We need more encounters.
    <br>We need more challenges to grow.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Challenges can be this, that, disappointment.
    <br>Let me give you a good example.
    <br>Yesterday, where I was living in Paraguay -
    <br>I don't know the place where I was living; it's very far.
    <br>It's in the outskirts of the town.
    <br>I'm sorry, I don't know the name.
    <br>I woke up around 7 am and there was serious rain.
    <br>It was this rain that woke me up.
    <br>I said, "Rain?"
    <br>"Lord, You never told me this!"
    <br>"What of the revival today?"
    <br>I received a phone call from the stadium -
    <br>the engineer that is in charge of the mic, audio, etc.
    <br>He said the scientific forecast said that there will be rain today.
    <br>It will be serious.
    <br>100 per cent and it will come with a storm.
    <br>He said he wanted to remove the speakers from the tower
    <br>so that the storm and the rain would not destroy the speakers.
    <br>I said, "That is the end of the crusade".
    <br>I said, "Look, I understand; this is rainy season".
    <br>I said, "I'm sorry, I will beg the rain".
    <br>And at the same time it was raining in my place.
    <br>Now, I didn't know what to pray for, whether to pray for revival or to pray for the rain to stop.
    <br>I had so many challenges now.
    <br>I called the stadium and they said the rain had started.
    <br>I went on my knees and said, "Lord, this is not the promise. Lord Jesus".
    <br>The rain stopped while I was praying.
    <br>I prayed for God to descend His mighty power; while praying for that, the rain started again.
    <br>Now, I would say ,"Lord, more anointing for today".
    <br>While saying this, the rain started again.
    <br>I would stop and say, "Lord, stop this rain!"
    <br>We need more challenges so that we can grow.
    <br>Challenges bring strength; challenges draw us closer to God.
    <br>The more the challenges, the more you develop your relationship with God -
    <br>the more your desire for God.
    <br>Challenges are our friend, not our enemy.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The ministry you are seeing today of T.B. Joshua, we had five ministries before this ministry.
    <br>When you look at the documentary, the first ministry was little children.
    <br>Seven to eight children.
    <br>With that, the storm came and destroyed everything.
    <br>Because there is a force I cannot resist,
    <br>the more that destruction,
    <br>the more those challenges,
    <br>the more that situation,
    <br>the more my desire for God.
    <br>The more I prayed the more.
    <br>The more I fasted the more.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I want to leave you with this Word.
    <br>Don't allow any situation,
    <br>don't allow any challenge,
    <br>don't allow any problem
    <br>to control you,
    <br>to mislead you,
    <br>to overwhelm you.
    <br>Rather, let the Spirit of God lead.
    <br>I repeat again:
    <br>Don't allow any situation to control you.
    <br>Don't allow any challenge to mislead you.
    <br>Don't allow any problem to overwhelm you.
    <br>Rather, let the Spirit of God lead you.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Because through obedience, we grow in character.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It is time now to lay hands with all my heart.
    <br>If I'm not going to lay hands through an offence,
    <br>you too should not receive it while holding offence.
    <br>If you receive this while holding an offence, it will not remain.
    <br>If you receive this impartation while holding an offence,
    <br>it will not stay.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Forget everything - forgive and forget.
    <br>God is your strength.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Injustice, they lie against you -
    <br>whatever they might have done to you -
    <br>you have no right as a Christian to hold an offence.
    <br>An offence is a trap of the enemy.
    <br>It could be strife, it could be anger, it could be hatred, it could be bitterness,
    <br>it could be jealousy, it could be envy.
    <br>Whatever anyone might have done to you,
    <br>'Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us'.
    <br>This is what is holding me today.
    <br>This is my life for you; this is the life I live.
    <br>Leave it for God. I give myself to prayer.
    <br>I want this to stay.
    <br>I don't want you to get home and on getting home, it is over again.
    <br>The Lord wants to be the Landlord of your body.
    <br>God wants to be the Landlord of your body.
    <br>He doesn't want to be a tenant.
    <br>He doesn't want to share your temple with anyone.
    <br>The Spirit of God does not want to share your temple with anger.
    <br>He does not want to share your temple with bitterness.
    <br>He does not want to share your temple with jealousy and envy.
    <br>He wants to be whole; He wants to be the Landlord.
    <br>The Paraguay Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank you!
