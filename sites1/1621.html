  <p>    
    <br>Rise up for prayer. Let us give thanks to God. Give thanks to Him with all your heart.
    <br>If there's anything you need to confess, begin to confess it right now.
    <br>Say, "Lord, have mercy on me. Let Your mercy and favour speak for me".
    <br>Begin to confess this.
    <br>Confess right now as a human being.
    <br>Son of David have mercy on me
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me
    <br>Your divine favour locate me
    <br>Son of David have mercy on me
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me. Your mercy.
    <br>Mercy.
    <br>Open your lips with all your heart: "Your mercy, Lord".
    <br>Your mercy, Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Thou power of deliverance!
    <br>Open your lips! Thou power of deliverance!
    <br>Whatever spirits operating in your life - command them out.
    <br>You know the spirits operating in your life -
    <br>spirit of pride, hate, arrogance - open your lips; ask God to free you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Spirit of disobedience.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Spirit of unfaithfulness.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Cast them out!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You know yourself and you know the challenges you are facing in terms of weakness -
    <br>that weakness in your life that has been holding you back.
    <br>You know your weakness.
    <br>You know your limitation.
    <br>Your weakness is the cause of your limitation.
    <br>What is the cause of your limitation?
    <br>Your weakness.
    <br>You know where you belong, but you have not reached there as a result of your weakness.
    <br>There is no limit to the blessing of God.
    <br>You are the head, not the tail, but as a result of your weakness, you are limited.
    <br>What you want to do, you cannot do. You find yourself doing what you don't want to do.
    <br>What you want to say is not what you are saying.
    <br>Your aim is not what you are doing.
    <br>Whatever weakness holding you back - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Just confess your weakness. Confess it.
    <br>For your information, there is no one without a weakness.
    <br>That is why you see us praying the more, fasting the more.
    <br>There is no one without a weakness.
    <br>Confess your weakness.
    <br>Confess your weakness.
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>This is the issue.
    <br>Your challenges are not the issue, but the weakness.
    <br>Your weakness is the issue.
    <br>Challenges are a way of life. But your weakness has to do with habit.
    <br>Your weakness - unforgiving spirit, keeping malice - these are weaknesses.
    <br>You never forgive your neighbour. But the Bible says you should forgive your neighbour.
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips, speak out your weakness, say it out.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace to live above your weakness.
    <br>This is what Paul means by saying, "When I am weak, then I am strong".
    <br>It means God speaks strength in his weakness.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Every damaged organ - begin to function!
    <br>Be it your kidneys, your liver, your blood, your bones, tissues -
    <br>every damaged organ - begin to function, in the name of Jesus! Open your lips, prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Every damaged organ - begin to function, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Begin to function, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You are a channel of God.
    <br>No matter what comes, no matter what happens, you are a channel of God.
    <br>Remain a channel of God, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can't hear your 'Amen!'
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>We have been talking of how to reshape your destiny.
    <br>And to reshape your destiny we have to talk about your weakness.
    <br>Your life will not remain the same.
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>The way out for you has come, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Amen!
