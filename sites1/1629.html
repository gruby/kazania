  <p>    
    <br>On November 19, 2000, the son and wife of the late Liberian President Samuel K. Doe,
    <br>who had been brutally assassinated in 1990, came to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>seeking prayer and guidance from Prophet T.B. Joshua and the salvation of their souls.
    <br>Let us hear from the Does.
    <br>President's Son FORGIVES Man Who MURDERED His Father!!!
    <br>Confession is very, very important.
    <br>Once you build your future around your past,
    <br>well, I'm telling you, you cannot make anything in your present
    <br>while your future will be in trouble.
    <br>So please, listen to this confession.
    <br>My name is Samuel Kanyon Doe Jr.
    <br>I'm 23 years old.
    <br>I'm the son of the former President of the Republic of Liberia.
    <br>Right next to me is my mother, Mrs Nancy B. Doe.
    <br>She is the wife of the late President of the Republic of Liberia.
    <br>We came to The SCOAN in search of our salvation
    <br>and for Prophet T.B. Joshua to pray for us and give us his guidance.
    <br>But in order for us to get our salvation,
    <br>we must forget our past
    <br>so that God can enable us to proceed in the future.
    <br>We are here today on behalf of the Doe family to confess our sins.
    <br>We have committed a lot of sins but the one that I feel,
    <br>that I know is obstructing my salvation
    <br>or our salvation, should I say,
    <br>is the grudge and the hatred I have in my heart for a particular person.
    <br>It all happened ten years ago
    <br>when my father was brutally killed in Liberia.
    <br>And this is the person that I can say,
    <br>every night I go to sleep, I pray and I pray all the time,
    <br>even though you don't pray for weakness but me,
    <br>I say it in front of everybody here that I prayed that one day
    <br>God would give me the opportunity to meet this man
    <br>and no matter what happened,
    <br>if he would kill me or I would kill him,
    <br>it's only God that would tell.
    <br>But at all costs, I would kill him to revenge the death of my father.
    <br>For ten years, I've had this grudge in my heart.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN...
    <br>It's not just that the man killed my father.
    <br>Or should I say, should I let you know that the man's name is Prince Johnson.
    <br>And as I speak right now, presently, he's here in our midst.
    <br>He is here today,
    <br>the man that brutally killed my father in front of the whole world.
    <br>This man that I saw, I've never seen him before
    <br>because I've never seen the death of my father.
    <br>I don't want to see the cassette. No, I'll never see it.
    <br>But when I was sitting on that side where the visitors are,
    <br>I don't know that man but I felt that feeling that somebody was around me.
    <br>So, I just felt cold in my body.
    <br>As I looked around, my eyes just visualized this person
    <br>and I said that's him; that's the man I'm looking for.
    <br>I felt anger and rage.
    <br>I even felt like running inside to where the kitchen is,
    <br>picking up a knife and coming back.
    <br>Even if I kill him, I know you'll set me free because this is the house of God.
    <br>How can a human being, when he's alive,
    <br>how can a person cut up a person?
    <br>Cut his hands, cut his ears,
    <br>publicly humiliate this man that was supposed to be the President of that nation,
    <br>drag him around, tie to the back of a car and drag him around in public.
    <br>And at the same time, filming this.
    <br>And I'm sure, as there are a lot of people here,
    <br>the majority of people here have seen this tape before.
    <br>Prophet, before I ask my brothers and sisters in Christ to join hands together
    <br>so I can receive my salvation, I just want to get one or two things off my chest.
    <br>It's not just that he recorded it but to make matters worse
    <br>and to add insult to injury,
    <br>one year later, after the death of my father, it wasn't enough for this man.
    <br>We quite understand what you want to say, even beyond what you are saying.
    <br>Now, could you please tell us what you want us to learn for the salvation of your soul?
    <br>My main point tonight of my being here
    <br>is that I would like everybody to know
    <br>that the great Jesus, our Lord, Jesus Christ
    <br>when He was being crucified, forgave everybody.
    <br>He told His Father, "I'm not..."
    <br>I don't know the Bible in detail.
    <br>The Book of Luke 23:34, please read.
    <br>"Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them for they do not know what they are doing'."
    <br>Madam, what lesson do you want us to learn from you?
    <br>He is the chief of the family.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>If Jesus can forgive us of our sins, then who am I to hold a grudge against a child of God?
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>President's Son FORGIVES Man Who MURDERED His Father!!!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, be delivered.
    <br>After confessing the anger and hatred in his heart towards his father's murderer,
    <br>Samuel Doe Jr. receives prayer in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>disconnecting him from his past and connecting him to his future, in Christ Jesus.
    <br>It is all over. We thank God!
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus.
    <br>Please, can you just rise up and let us sing and praise God
    <br>for the wonderful thing Jesus just did now.
    <br>President's Son FORGIVES Man Who MURDERED His Father!!!
    <br>This is the man in question, Prince Yormie Johnson,
    <br>being led by Prophet T.B. Joshua from the midst of the congregation
    <br>to the altar for a moment of prayer,
    <br>believing in Christ's power of forgiveness and reconciliation.
    <br>President's Son FORGIVES Man Who MURDERED His Father!!!
    <br>Encouraging the Doe family in their decision to reach out in forgiveness to Prince Johnson,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua reminds them that we all stand in helpless need of God's divine forgiveness.
    <br>Mrs Nancy Doe kneels at the altar to give thanks to God for the reconciliation,
    <br>which had already began to take place.
    <br>God has written us into an unprecedented, revolutionary story of reconciliation,
    <br>in which hostilities are destroyed, enemies become friends,
    <br>neighbours reunite and nations put their arms around each other in peace.
    <br>The first time in history,
    <br>the Doe family meets with the man responsible for the death of President Doe, and they embrace.
    <br>Overseeing their reconciliation, Prophet T.B. Joshua joins their embrace.
    <br>Just as the wolf can never dwell with the lamb,
    <br>so also a son can never call his father's murderer dear friend.
    <br>For this to happen, it means there must be reconciliation.
    <br>Truly, the gospel of God's grace challenges and changes everything.
    <br>The reconciliation of late President Samuel Doe's family
    <br>and Prince Yormie Johnson continued at The SCOAN
    <br>as they sat down together with Prophet T.B. Joshua to discuss the way forward for the families,
    <br>the tribes and the nation of Liberia.
    <br>We are happy to have this meeting.
    <br>And the purpose of our meeting here this evening
    <br>is to give thanks to God for the wonderful work our Lord, Jesus Christ did in our lives.
    <br>This is a good example of Christ-likeness.
    <br>The Bible says that we should forgive those who sin against us.
    <br>I'm taking you to the Book of Luke 11:1-4.
    <br>"Father, forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us."
    <br>Not only that, if you remember the pathetic word our Lord Jesus
    <br>pronounced on the cross in the Book of Luke 23:34.
    <br>He said, "Father, forgive them".
    <br>So, the word 'them' shows that we should forgive all -
    <br>our enemy, persecutor, friend, neighbour.
    <br>So, we are here today to demonstrate the quality and characteristics of a Spirit-filled life
    <br>by forgiving our friend, our neighbour and our enemy.
    <br>There's no way he could receive this salvation without coming to reconciliation.
    <br>It was in the last service on Sunday during the open confession
    <br>that I confessed my feelings towards Mr Johnson, now next to me,
    <br>about how, before coming to The SCOAN, he was my worst enemy.
    <br>Anywhere I saw him, it was do or die; either he would die or I would die.
    <br>He couldn't go free like that, after the death of my father.
    <br>So, I just felt that hatred.
    <br>After the last service amazingly, the Spirit of God captured me
    <br>and all those feelings I felt, even though I was still angry at the time,
    <br>I was restless because I couldn't attack anybody,
    <br>I couldn't do anything; I was restless.
    <br>I was under the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>So, this Sunday, I confessed in public about my feelings and I got delivered.
    <br>Since my deliverance, I've felt peace of mind; I've felt peace.
    <br>At last, it's a breaking point between the two families, the Krahn and the Gios.
    <br>From here on, I just hope that our Lord Jesus
    <br>would continue to manifest His power and show us the way
    <br>so that one day we can go back home and people can learn from this
    <br>that it doesn't necessarily mean that what starts bad will end bad.
    <br>I just thank God because this is a new thing for me.
    <br>I'm sure my mom feels the same way, too.
    <br>And we hope that this will be an ongoing process
    <br>and that it won't stop right now when it has just started.
    <br>We still have a long way. This is just the beginning.
    <br>Thank you very much, Prophet.
    <br>You are the one that caused this today, before we and Mr Johnson could sit down together.
    <br>If not for you today, it would be very hard for us to sit down together.
    <br>It would be very hard.
    <br>It would be very hard because nothing turned out good.
    <br>So now, my husband left me with eight children.
    <br>And we want to go back home.
    <br>We're tired of being in exile.
    <br>So, I thank God very much for bringing us together and opening our way
    <br>so that we can go back home.
    <br>Nothing turned out good. All of us had to leave Liberia.
    <br>We want to go back home.
    <br>This is a wonderful thing that has happened to me, the greatest thing.
    <br>I have never heard of this anywhere.
    <br>The incident that took place during the war, people saw it on the television -
    <br>for the family of the President to be with me, is the work of God.
    <br>I praise God and glorify God for this marvelous work He has done through you
    <br>and the people of The SCOAN.
    <br>This reconciliation will go a long way to unite our two ethnic groups.
    <br>The war in Liberia started between us and the reconciliation will have to begin with us.
    <br>So the two of us, the two tribes, the family of President Doe
    <br>is my family hereafter and my family is theirs.
    <br>We will continue to work for peace and God bless them.
    <br>We thank God Almighty.
    <br>God Almighty will be with you for forgiving him.
    <br>It is God Almighty who will pay you back for forgiving him.
    <br>So, that will go a long way to really show how he feels,
    <br>how he appreciates the reconciliation,
    <br>Even the effects of it on the children,
    <br>if this is not settled now, our children will continue to live...
    <br>Let's hear from you.
    <br>What do you think the effect of it would have been?
    <br>What has always bothered me
    <br>about three or four years ago before I came here,
    <br>was the future of the children.
    <br>The children are innocent.
    <br>They don't know where they hail from.
    <br>They think they are Nigerians.
    <br>They speak Yoruba. They speak the dialect here.
    <br>And I have been praying for God to bring about this day.
    <br>And you are now making it possible.
    <br>I tried in my own human way but I had no hope.
    <br>But I was always praying that God would bring a time
    <br>and this is the time that God has brought.
    <br>So, the future of the children now is very bright.
    <br>Because of this reconciliation.
    <br>And I'm asking all of our people in Nimba County
    <br>to understand that the Krahn people are their brothers.
    <br>And let the Krahn people understand that the Nimba people are their brothers.
    <br>And let the past be remembered no more.
    <br>OK, let us assume that this reconciliation did not happen today.
    <br>What do you think would have been the future of our children?
    <br>If the reconciliation had not taken place, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>there would be no future for our children.
    <br>In fact, the two ethnic groups would always be at loggerheads with each other.
    <br>But as of now, God is in control.
    <br>And God will definitely reunite our people and bring peace to our country.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Personally, I share the same opinion because
    <br>if this reconciliation would not have happened,
    <br>then for one thing, I would still be after him.
    <br>And we would still have that grudge and there would be no progress.
    <br>And everything would still be at a standstill.
    <br>But through the divine work of God through you,
    <br>now we shall have a better life, a new life and we shall progress
    <br>and at least go forth and do God's will.
    <br>Dear Heavenly Father, as we gather in Your midst today,
    <br>we just want to thank, praise and glorify Your name.
    <br>Thank You for all the signs and wonders you showed us this week.
    <br>Heavenly Father, we pray that You would continue to show more signs and wonders, Lord
    <br>because with You, all things are possible.
    <br>Heavenly Father, as we are here and before we leave to go our way,
    <br>we pray that this bond should last forever and that Your power would work through us
    <br>and that we would go out and spread the Word to people
    <br>that there always has to be peace and reconciliation
    <br>between any troubled family or group.
    <br>And we just thank You, Father, for the grace that You have done these
    <br>signs and wonders that had never happened before in history.
    <br>And with power, we will continue to come abundantly into The SCOAN,
    <br>where it all started from, Lord Jesus.
    <br>I just want to thank and praise You, Heavenly Father, for this peace
    <br>and wonderful feeling You've given us,
    <br>so that we will go home and tell our people for years to come,
    <br>in the mighty name of Jesus, Lord.
    <br>As we leave this place, we just want to thank and praise You
    <br>that You've blessed each and everyone.
    <br>And be with us at all times. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Father, we thank You for the lives of Your children.
    <br>We thank You for the gift of forgiveness You have given to the two tribes,
    <br>for forgiving them for their past
    <br>and for giving them the grace to pour out their hearts' desires,
    <br>what they had concealed in their minds for long.
    <br>Today, we thank You that You have brought it into the light.
    <br>We thank You, once again for taking more of them and giving them more of You.
    <br>They need more of You to live and remember You, oh Lord.
    <br>They need more of You to remember the day they confessed
    <br>and the day You forgave them.
    <br>They need more of You to pray and more of You to talk about Jesus.
    <br>Father, we want to hear good news about their lives
    <br>and about the things You have done in their lives.
    <br>They want a turning point -
    <br>turning point that the situation will change for the good.
    <br>In Luke 23:34, Jesus said, "Father forgive them".
    <br>We need to forgive because we need to be forgiven.
    <br>Forgiveness is the bridge to the future.
    <br>Father, we want this to be permanent and it shall be permanent,
    <br>in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
