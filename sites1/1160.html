  <p>    
    <br>Can I talk to you?
    <br>I saw you when you were dancing.
    <br>That's  good.
    <br>Are you sure when you leave here, you will not go back to your past life?
    <br>Because I see you as a harlot.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the church, harlot must be delivered.
    <br>If I collect thanksgiving or offering from you without delivering you,
    <br>I will be punished for that.
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That spirit of immorality - out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>If I discover her, and I could not deliver her, then the message is not from God.
    <br>If I see you are a thief, anybody can see that.
    <br>But to now release that belief by faith, I must show you that God sent me to you by faith.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You see, that spirit is coming out.
    <br>When it is all over, she will be free.
    <br>See her.
    <br>It is a serious thing. Just leave her, let her get free.
    <br>She has been in that job for profit, for many years.
    <br>Let her get free.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES.
    <br>Mrs Paula Santana 
    <br>Cuban Living In Spain.
    <br>My mother is of Nigerian descent and my father is Spanish.
    <br>She said her name is Paula and she comes from Spain but originally, she is from Cuba.
    <br>Her mother is actually from Nigeria originally - from generations before -
    <br>and her father is originally from Spain.
    <br>Can you tell us what happened last Sunday?
    <br>What was the prophecy you received from Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Mrs Paula Santana 
    <br>Cuban Living In Spain
    <br>Last week Prophet T.B. Joshua gave her a prophecy,
    <br>saying that there was a spirit of prostitution in her which she confirmed to be true.
    <br>This was something that had been tormenting her life for the past 20 years.
    <br>Now she is free.
    <br>Can you explain how this spirit entered your life?
    <br>When I was about 4 years old, I remember that a relative of my mother used to come to the house
    <br>to perform rituals of witchcraft with animals and one day, I was also taken to his house as well.
    <br>From there, I began to have nightmares of animals chasing me and men grabbing my neck.
    <br>There was always a presence that disturbed me.
    <br>When she was very young and growing up in Cuba; when she was about 4 years old,
    <br>a relative of her mother came to the house; he was a witch doctor.
    <br>He began to do rituals with cowries, charms and animals.
    <br>After that she began to dream where she saw animals pursuing her in the dream.
    <br>She saw men pursuing her and demons attacking her in her dreams.
    <br>When I was 16 years old, I was raped by a policeman who pointed a gun at my neck.
    <br>He threatened me saying that if I told anyone, he would kill my parents.
    <br>Ever since I was four years old, people used to call me, 'Crazy'. It became my second name.
    <br>When she was 16 years old, she was raped by a policeman.
    <br>He threatened her that if she told anyone, he would kill her.
    <br>So she kept that secret and never told anyone.
    <br>From that young age, as well as seeing demons in her dreams,
    <br>she would also hear a voice telling her that she was going to run mad.
    <br>And very soon, people began to give her that name. Her second name was 'Crazy'.
    <br>People would call her a mad woman.
    <br>When I was 19 years old, my father was sick with cancer and we were five children.
    <br>At this time in Cuba, it was very difficult because there was nothing.
    <br>A friend suggested that I should join a modelling agency so I could help my family so I did.
    <br>When she was nineteen years old, it was a crisis time in Cuba.
    <br>There was nothing to eat; it was a real time of crisis.
    <br>There was so much need.
    <br>A friend came to her and said, "Paula, why don't you start modeling?
    <br>This can help your family because you have a good stature. You can go into modelling".
    <br>So she started to do that.
    <br>When I arrived at the place, I realised that it was not really what they had told me
    <br>but that it was more like a brothel with a different outlook but still the same.
    <br>So, I started doing prostitution and in that place, I met my first husband when I was 19 years old.
    <br>I got pregnant for him and gave birth to a baby girl
    <br>but when she was one week old, he disappeared from my life.
    <br>I went back to prostitution and shortly before this, I had been initiated into santeria (witchraft).
    <br>I took the decision to follow that route so I did it.
    <br>What she thought was just modelling, when she arrived at the place,
    <br>it was like a club; it was actually a prostitute house.
    <br>So she found herself doing prostitution.
    <br>This continued and she actually got initiated into witchcraft.
    <br>One day she went to a place and they initiated her with 'santeria'.
    <br>which is a witchcraft religion in Cuba.
    <br>One day she met a man who came to the place where they were doing prostitution.
    <br>He was a foreigner and a lot older than her.
    <br>He impregnated her and when the  baby was born, he abandoned her.
    <br>I entered into santeria (witchcraft) because I was told that I would leave Cuba and
    <br>I would not go mad like I had been told since I was small, so I was initiated.
    <br>Truly, I left Cuba and went to Spain when I was 23 years old.
    <br>When I met my husband, he was 47 years old and I was 19 years old.
    <br>When she entered into the witchcraft and they did the ritual,
    <br>it was for her to leave Cuba; that was why they were doing the ritual.
    <br>And also for her not to go crazy because she always heard a voice telling her
    <br>that she was going to run mad.
    <br>So in order for her not to go mad and for her to be able to leave Cuba,
    <br>that was why they did that ritual.
    <br>Soon after that, that was when the man came and took her away to Spain
    <br>and that was how she left Cuba.
    <br>Soon after arriving in Spain with my first husband, I lost affection for him
    <br>and had relationships with young men like me.
    <br>There was something that pushed me to go out to the streets and go to clubs.
    <br>This spirit of prostitution continued tormenting me as men kept following me
    <br>and I continued seeing animals biting me in my dreams. This went on for years.
    <br>When she went to Spain, this spirit of prostitution continued to torment her.
    <br>Although in the physical, she was married to her husband,
    <br>but she continued to have relationships with different men
    <br>because this spirit of prostitution continued to torment her.
    <br>She would see animals in her dreams, she would see men coming to sleep with her in her dreams,
    <br>and people would look at her as if she was a prostitute.
    <br>It was then that I met my second husband and I began attending church again.
    <br>I had abandoned the church for long because of my involvement in witchcraft.
    <br>However, this demon always tormented me - e.g. I would leave the house, dressed normally
    <br>but men would pursue me and the cars would stop because of me and I didn't know why.
    <br>I would ask myself why men continued to stare at me and hoot their cars.
    <br>I didn't understand but men would stop their cars and make indecent proposals to me
    <br>and I would even be dressed more decently than others.
    <br>Now I understand that it was that same spirit that was attracting the men.
    <br>Also, dogs kept chasing me and I kept having nightmares.
    <br>Whilst she was in Spain, the spirit of prostitution kept tormenting her,
    <br>to the extent that men would stop their cars in the streets, just to ask to be with her.
    <br>It was not normal because she would dress like a normal person, not as a prostitute.
    <br>When she walked down the street, men would stop their cars and wanted to sleep with her.
    <br>This caused so many problems between her and her husband
    <br>because men would always be approaching her.
    <br>Not only that, in her dreams, she would be always bitten by dogs.
    <br>She would see a dog coming to her, animals coming to her
    <br>and men sleeping with her and this continued.
    <br>There were days where I woke up and said that I didn't want to be married anymore.
    <br>I had everything - a perfect marrriage where my husband loved me and I loved him.
    <br>He would ask me, "If we have everything, why do you behave like a mad woman?"
    <br>I would suddenly want to leave him, run away from the house or become aggressive.
    <br>I would start to say things that didn't make sense.
    <br>I would insult him and reject him and didn't want him to come near me.
    <br>One day, I even lost affection for him although I loved my husband,
    <br>I felt the presence of something that was always in-between us.
    <br>Many times, the spirit would fight me or enter him and he would fight me; it was a terrible thing.
    <br>Although we had everthing, it was like living in hell.
    <br>It was like living in hell because when she married her second husband
    <br>and she loved her husband, there was always a satanic presence between her and her husband.
    <br>She always felt the presence of someone who would not allow her to love her husband.
    <br>Anytime she wanted to be with her husband and show affection towards him,
    <br>this spirit would not allow her.
    <br>She would become aggressive towards him; she would reject him.
    <br>She would fight him, and that spirit always caused division between them.
    <br>She would just wake up and say that she didn't want to be married anymore.
    <br>That spirit would want her to run out of the house
    <br>and kept telling her that she was going mad, until one day, she even lost her mind.
    <br>One day, I was doing exercise with my friend from the Dominican Republic
    <br>when she said, "Paula, why don't you come to my house and watch a T.B. Joshua video?"
    <br>When she put the video on, I said to her, "Do you really believe this? Remove it!"
    <br>She persuaded me to watch it and when I finally did, I was amazed at the presence of God.
    <br>I began to cry and within me, I felt a divine connection with The SCOAN and the prophet.
    <br>It was something supernatural that happened in my life.
    <br>Later the pastors of my church organised the visit to The SCOAN and I was the last one to join.
    <br>It wasn't in my plan but it was in God's plan that I would be here in this place.
    <br>One day, her friend from the Dominican Republic came to her house and said,
    <br>"Paula, why don't you watch T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>So she showed her a video of Prophet T.B. Joshua on the internet.
    <br>When she watched, she said, "What is this? I don't want to watch this!" and she stopped watching
    <br>Later something told her that she should watch again.
    <br>And when she began watching Emmanuel TV, there was an immediate spiritual connection.
    <br>She realised that truly, God is inside this man and this is somewhere where she could be free.
    <br>Later she realised that her church was organising a trip to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>She was the last person to be appointed to go on this trip.
    <br>It was in the plans of God for her to be here.
    <br>When I came to the service, I was seated in the front and I was praying that the prophet would see me.
    <br>I knew that I needed to be free from this strange presence that was always with me.
    <br>I was seated at the front then I was moved to the back and I was very angry
    <br>because I wanted to be in the front so I could be seen by the pastor.
    <br>Then the Holy Spirit said to me, "Paula, don't be afraid. God will find you wherever you are".
    <br>When she came to the service, she sat in the front row
    <br>because she wanted to be seen by the man of God.
    <br>She just wanted to be free from this spirit of prostitution and this spirit of madness
    <br>- these spirits tormenting her.
    <br>But suddenly she was moved to the back.
    <br>She was so angry and annoyed, thinking, "How can the prophet see me if I'm at the back?"
    <br>But the Holy Spirit told her, "Wherever you are, God will locate you today".
    <br>Mrs Paula Santana
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>It happened for the glory of God. It was my day of freedom, when the chains were loosed.
    <br>He came up to me and prophesied, and something happened to my body.
    <br>Something strong left me. The only thing I know is that I fell to the floor.
    <br>I have not seen the video but I just remember that there was a voice tellilng me,
    <br>"No, my child, sleep; I will not let you go. You are mine" - it was a woman's voice.
    <br>When the prophet came towards her and prophesied to her,
    <br>all that she can remember is that she fell under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>She can't remember anything, except that she heard a voice telling her,
    <br>"No, you are mine; you are my child. I will not let you go".
    <br>She felt as if someone was holding her at the arms
    <br>and telling her, "No, I will not let you go".
    <br>I was free in that moment from all those spirits.
    <br>It was a difficult moment but I give thanks to God for choosing me.
    <br>That was my moment and I am free from all those demons of my mind.
    <br>I am free from hair extensions which I was addicted to before.
    <br>I am now a normal woman, I love the way God created me but above all, I love God
    <br>who had mercy on me and that is why today, I can give this testimony.
    <br>Really, it was her moment, it was her time for deliverance.
    <br>She felt such an amazing presence of 
    <br>God.
    <br>Those chains that held her bound for so many years were cut.
    <br>Not only that, but she also had this love and too much connection with artificial hair extensions.
    <br>After her deliverance, she removed her extensions.
    <br>Now that she is free, this is her natural hair, her natural self.
    <br>This is the person God has created 
    <br>her to be; she knows who she is now.
    <br>Mrs Paula Santana
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So we give thanks to God for your life and we want to ask you:
    <br>Since last week, what are the changes you have noticed after your deliverance?
    <br>Mrs Paula Santana
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My mind is totally free. I don't have any more nightmares. No one pursues me anymore.
    <br>I don't feel that evil presence anymore.
    <br>I can't wait to get home and see my husband and restore what this demon had stolen from us.
    <br>I am experiencing the greatest freedom ever in my life.
    <br>All these spirits of prostitution and lust have disappeared from my life for the glory of God.
    <br>After her deliverance, she is a totally changed person.
    <br>Now, she doesn't have those nightmares;
    <br>she doesn't feel that demon following her everywhere.
    <br>She doesn't feel that spirit of prostitution - it is totally gone.
    <br>She cant wait to go back home to see her husband
    <br>because now she feels so much affection for him
    <br>and she knows that what the demon has robbed in that relationship, God has restored.
    <br>She wants to go back and be with him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Mrs Paula Santana
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>We thank God for your life and we want to ask you:
    <br>What advice do you have for all those watching you all over the world
    <br>who are in a similar position that you were in and are not able to break free?
    <br>How would you advice them?
    <br>Mrs Paula Santana
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>From my experience, I would like to advise people to trust in God.
    <br>They should watch Emmanuel TV because it was the door that God opened for my deliverance.
    <br>God is in this place and there is a man here whose heart is according to the will of God.
    <br>A man with a pure and transparent heart that when I looked into his eyes, I saw Jesus.
    <br>There is such a strong presence of God here. I encourage people to come here.
    <br>This is a piece of Heaven on earth.
    <br>This is the best thing that you can experience if you truly open your heart for deliverance.
    <br>She wants to advise everyone that from her experience in life,
    <br>she wants to tell people that you should trust in God.
    <br>Also, you should get connected with Emmanuel TV
    <br>because that was the door that God opened for her to receive her deliverance.
    <br>Truly, there is power of God in this place.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has a heart that is really in line with God's Word and God's will.
    <br>He has such a pure heart and because of that, Heaven has come to earth in this place - The SCOAN.
    <br>She recommends everyone to come and receive their deliverance, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Mrs Paula Santana
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>We thank God for your life and we want to encourage you,
    <br>now that you have been delivered by Christ's Word, you should continue to be ruled by that Word
    <br>and make that Word the standard for your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Mrs Paula Santana
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! This anointing is going back with me to the Canary Islands! Amen!
    <br>Amen, thank You Jesus. I am taking this anointing with me to my country, in Jesus' name!
