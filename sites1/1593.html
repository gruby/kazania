  <p>    
    <br>There is a gentleman - you are bedwetting.
    <br>You don't know how this thing came about; it started from your dream.
    <br>You find yourself sleeping with people in the night in your dream; this is a nightmare.
    <br>You are bedwetting.
    <br>You are from another country; please come out.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Come out and let's put an end to this.
    <br>You are bedwetting; you get wet.
    <br>Sometimes, you wear pads to move around.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>I think your case needs urgent attention. Come here.
    <br>Come to me.

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Jade. I am 26 years old.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of bedwetting, and a spiritual wife.
    <br>Last week when I was among the crowd, about two seats back over here,
    <br>the Prophet was busy with the mass prayer
    <br>and he said that there is someone that is here with the problem of bedwetting.
    <br>I immediately knew that it was me,
    <br>because on the inside I was feeling extremely warm at that moment.
    <br>It felt like my body was cringing up; it was folding on the inside.
    <br>And something pulled me forward and then I ended up in front.
    <br>This problem has been tormenting me for the past six or seven years.
    <br>It started with a spirit of lust - I was very lustful growing up - and it started a very young age.
    <br>This problem grew continuously.
    <br>I never knew that it was really serious until I was exposed to pornography on a daily basis.
    <br>About six or seven years ago I was attacked in a dream by a spiritual wife.
    <br>The spiritual wife would come to me in different forms
    <br>- sometimes in the form of relatives or family members or friends -
    <br>and she would sleep with me and I would mess in my bed.
    <br>No one knew about it; I always kept it to myself.
    <br>About once or twice a week the spiritual woman would come and sleep with me in my dream,
    <br>to the extent that I had to wear a Pamper [pad] at times
    <br>and as I said, nobody knew about it.
    <br>Sometimes I would fold toilet paper as well to cover the mess because I would walk around.
    <br>As a young man it was very embarrassing.
    <br>This is something that I kept to myself.
    <br>I would use a lot of toilet paper because when I walked I was always leaking for no reason.
    <br>I did not know what the problem was.
    <br>This spiritual wife kept on attacking me.
    <br>As these dreams persisted, the lustful spirit also increased
    <br>to the extent that whenever I saw women around me, I would never see them with clothes on.
    <br>It was as if I had a microscope on; I would always see them naked.
    <br>It is as though I had another set of eyes.
    <br>I did not know what was wrong with me.
    <br>That is when I knew that my problem was serious.
    <br>This also isolated me.
    <br>I became very bitter.
    <br>I became very sad and I would always isolate myself.
    <br>I would never go out and socialise because of this issue.
    <br>I would always use this toilet paper to cover up my private parts.
    <br>This was very embarrassing to me, so I would not go out.
    <br>Can you tell us when the man of God prayed for you, what did you experience at that time?
    <br>When he called me out, I was shocked because there are so many people here.
    <br>But in my heart I was using the prayer that he taught us,
    <br>"Locate me, Lord. Locate me in Your mercy, locate me in Your favour".
    <br>And as I was meditating, he called me out.
    <br>As you saw in the video, he said that my case needed more attention.
    <br>As I walked to him, I started to shake
    <br>- out there they call it "the hammer".
    <br>When he touched me it felt as if there was a strong wind that went right through my hand and through my body.
    <br>I was very prideful.
    <br>I always said that whenever pastors or evangelists prayed for me I would never just fall down for anyone.
    <br>I would always stand my ground.
    <br>You mean you would always tell yourself that?
    <br>Yes, I would tell myself that I will never ever fall down.
    <br>So what made you fall?
    <br>It was that pride. The next thing I knew, pride was lying on the floor.
    <br>Hallelujah. Put your hands together.
    <br>"NO PASTOR COULD MAKE ME FALL... !!!"
    <br>What was the last thing that was on your mind before you came here for deliverance?
    <br>There was a time when I was so depressed because I was reflecting on my life.
    <br>You know, when the devil starts speaking to you.
    <br>I was thinking that there were so many closed doors, disappointments and failure.
    <br>And then this problem was also there.
    <br>So I felt extremely depressed.
    <br>There was also a time that I was extremely suicidal.
    <br>I had prepared everything in the room to hang myself and I was ready to commit suicide,
    <br>but then I received a phone call at that very moment, and it was one of my aunts who always encourages me,
    <br>she always prays for me and she phoned me at that very moment
    <br>and she told me that the Lord had put in her heart to call me at that very moment.
    <br>I was already standing on the chair, about to jump.
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>What led you to come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations?
    <br>I had been watching the ministry for so many years and I had fallen in love with everything that was going on here.
    <br>I love Jesus so much and I knew that this was the only place that I would find my solution,
    <br>because I had been to so many places. I had been prayed for so many times.
    <br>I had even looked online at some sites, at medicines, these types of things -  I tried looking for solution all over.
    <br>I was prayed for and I was fasting and praying as well.
    <br>But the more I fasted and prayed, the more it became worse.
    <br>Then I decided that I needed to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I needed to get here because this was the only place where I would receive my freedom
    <br>and I believe that I have received it now, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Put your hands together.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Since after the prophecy that you received, what is the difference in your life? What has God done?
    <br>I can speak to women normally now; I see them as normal people now.
    <br>The bedwetting has completely stopped.
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>And what about the spiritual woman that used to attack you? Are you still seeing her?
    <br>No, not at all. Praise the Lord.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, especially men,
    <br>put your shame and embarrassment aside.
    <br>If you want a permanent solution, you will only find it in Jesus Christ.
    <br>The man of God always teaches us that we should continue to meditate in our hearts
    <br>because meditation brings revelation and it is power steps; it is a visit with God.
    <br>As you meditate, there will come a time where Jesus will commit Himself to your deliverance as well, in Jesus' name
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>We want to advise you that remember, as the man of God would say,
    <br>that receiving deliverance is not the only thing you need.
    <br>You need to cast aside your old self, your self-sufficiency, and take in the new life, in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Remember that you have made the first decision, the biggest decision, which is following Christ daily.
    <br>So continue to follow Him.
    <br>Just as the Bible says, that the steps of a righteous man are ordered by God.
    <br>So let Him continue to order your steps and it shall be well with you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
