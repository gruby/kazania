  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to share with you one of my habits.
    <br>It is all about fitness.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>I want you to be fit for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>What is good for me is good for you.
    <br>For me, exercise is a way of life.
    <br>We were created to do everything as an exercise
    <br>because God wants us to stay active in order to keep our bodies functioning.
    <br>Viewers, let me give you a good example of what I am talking about.
    <br>Imagine a car that is permanently parked and the one that is being used.
    <br>No matter how new these cars are, the parked one will depreciate faster.
    <br>Viewers, this is the case of our bodies when we remain inactive.
    <br>Many sicknesses and diseases we are suffering from today were nursed over time.
    <br>We brought them about through our habits - sitting all the time, eating all the time, sleeping all the time,
    <br>avoiding keeping your body warm, avoiding keeping your body in motion.
    <br>A cold body is a dead body and a warm body is a living one.
    <br>Let us ask ourselves: How many times have you been out in the sun?
    <br>How many times have you decided to climb the stairs, instead of taking a lift, just as an exercise?
    <br>Without moving around, without stretching our bodies, we are giving room to a terminal disease.
    <br>This is why I am sharing this experience - my habit with you, it is good for you.
    <br>Many of our chores, tasks we ask our domestic helps to do are actually good for our physical fitness,
    <br>e.g., sweeping the floor.
    <br>When we are sweeping the floor, we engage the whole system.
    <br>When you are washing - either standing or bending - you are engaging the whole system.
    <br>They are good for you!
    <br>When we cannot bend down, as we are trying to wear shoes,
    <br>as we are trying to wash our feet, this means there is a problem.
    <br>Be careful of a terminal disease.

    <br>Take your time to encourage the sick ones to engage in some physical activities.
    <br>Certain things are more rewarding than financial assistance.
    <br>Those who are on the sickbed, who have been lying down for long without being able to turn -
    <br>look for them and help them to turn.

    <br>Certain things are more rewarding than financial assistance.
    <br>Those who are lonely - keep them company.
    <br>Those who cannot eat, feed them; encourage them to eat.

    <br>If water is left in a container, over time, it will change colour.
    <br>This is the case of our body.
    <br>Viewers, this is the case of our body when it remains inactive.
    <br>God bless you, viewers.
