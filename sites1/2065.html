  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I greet you:
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God be with us, who can be against us?
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Let me just give you encouraging words.
    <br>Let someone say, "Encouraging Words".
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's look at the Book of Job 29:24,
    <br>"If I mocked at them, they did not believe it;
    <br>and the light of my countenance they did not cast down."
    <br>As a Christian, your look of approval at those in need,
    <br>at those in trouble gives hope and assurance.
    <br>"If I mocked at them, they did not believe it;
    <br>and the light of my countenance they did not cast down."
    <br>Your identifying with those in need, with those in trouble is precious to them.
    <br>Looking at the other side when your neighbour is in need,
    <br>when your neighbour is in trouble is ungodly.
    <br>This is what Job is saying.
    <br>Loving your enemy is always unreasonable,
    <br>unless you realize that you were an enemy of God, until He forgave you.
    <br>If not, you would see love to your enemy as unreasonable.
    <br>In Matthew 5:44, "Love your neighbour as yourself."
    <br>Your neighbour could be your friend, could be your enemy,
    <br>could be those who do not share the same faith with you - love them all.
    <br>Unless you realize that you were an enemy of God, until He forgave you...
    <br>It is also His will that you remember that you have sinned and been forgiven.
    <br>For it is that remembrance that creates, that gives a forgiving heart,
    <br>a loving heart towards your neighbour.
    <br>Your neighbour could be your friend, could be your enemy
    <br>or those who do not share the same faith with you - whatever religion.
    <br>The Bible says if you love an enemy, you see him or her as Christ does.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you love an enemy, you see him or her as Christ does."
    <br>Again.
    <br>[When you love an enemy, you see him or her as Christ does.]
    <br>When you love an enemy, you see him or her as Christ does.
    <br>It is an idiom, a parable.
    <br>The issue is not resolved until forgiveness is voiced and received from the heart.
    <br>Trust and obey
    <br>For there is no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>But to trust and obey
    <br>Don't allow confrontation and sin to tear you down or pull you apart.
    <br>Rather, see confrontation and sin as a means of your coming closer together,
    <br>going together and being prepared together
    <br>for an ever greater relationship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Don't allow confrontation and sin to tear you down or pull you apart.
    <br>Rather, see confrontation and sin as a means of coming closer together,
    <br>going together and being prepared together for an ever greater relationship."
    <br>HOW TO LOVE YOUR ENEMIES! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>It means: Don't reject anyone on account of weakness
    <br>because the future is a mystery.
    <br>Don't reject anyone on account of weakness today,
    <br>because the future is a mystery.
    <br>You cannot say what will happen tomorrow.
    <br>Someone you reject may be your helper or your strength tomorrow.
    <br>The future is a mystery!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The future is a mystery!"
    <br>Someone you reject may be your helper, may be your strength tomorrow.

    <br>Encouraging Words
    <br>A person who is a thorn in your flesh today, may be your helper tomorrow.
    <br>Don't reject anyone on account of weakness.
    <br>Someone you reject because of weakness, because of confrontation,
    <br>because of sin, may be your strength, your helper or your boss tomorrow.
    <br>HOW TO LOVE YOUR ENEMIES! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>If I reject you on account of your weakness, I also reject your strength.
    <br>If a person is weak in one area, he may be strong in another area.

    <br>I want to leave you here.
    <br>I call it 'Encouraging Words'.
