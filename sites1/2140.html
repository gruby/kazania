    <br>My brother.
    <br>There is a spirit of depression.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>I want to see you.
    <br>He has a very rich man in the family.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>And he suddenly died of this depression - by suicide.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Wen Zuo Cong.
    <br>I come from China.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was depression.
    <br>Every morning, I woke up with worry.
    <br>I felt like I had no tomorrow.
    <br>I even had the idea of killing myself.
    <br>Sometimes my heart would beat very fast; sometimes it would beat slowly.
    <br>I could not walk very fast.
    <br>I also had problems with nose bleeding so I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>The prophecy that the man of God gave to me was a big secret no one could have known,
    <br>because I had never met the man of God before; I have never talked to him.
    <br>I can only speak a little English.
    <br>What he told me was the truth.
    <br>At the time, it was a secret.
    <br>My uncle died a few years ago; he was a very rich man.
    <br>When he died, I was not happy because he was young - he was so young and rich.
    <br>After the prophet gave me the prophecy, I went back to my country and my depression was gone.
    <br>I was healed of the heart problems I was having.
    <br>I can play basketball. I can do anything.
    <br>My heart problems were over; I was healed.
    <br>After receiving the prophecy, I was able to do anything.
    <br>I have hope for tomorrow.
    <br>I am happy!
    <br>My advice is Jesus is the living God.
    <br>Everything you see in the Bible is truth.
    <br>We should forgive each other for everything and love each other.
    <br>Jesus is the answer.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus for that wonderful advice.
