  <p>    
    <br>Viewers at home, wherever you are right now, receive your heart!
    <br>That heart that is full of unforgiveness is not your heart.
    <br>It is not your heart.
    <br>Originally, you were created with forgiveness.
    <br>Receive your heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>A heart that is full of love, full of forgiveness, full of pardon,
    <br>full of faithfulness, obedience, humility - receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br> Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command deliverance on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Freedom, blessing, prosperity, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being healed!
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>I can see you being blessed!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough, in your business!
    <br>Breakthrough, in your career!
    <br>Breakthrough, in your finances!
    <br>Breakthrough, in your family!
    <br>Breakthrough, in your health!
    <br>Breakthrough, in your marriage!
    <br>Breakthrough, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br> Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>It is well!
    <br>It is well
    <br>With my soul
    <br>It is well
    <br>It is well with my soul
