  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I believe you are going to have a wonderful day with Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>The title of our message: Fear Not.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Fear not.
    <br>Fear changes our focus.
    <br>Fear weakens our determination and willpower.
    <br>Fear is a more deceptive enemy than satan himself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Fear not.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>(Mark 10:46-52) - The blind man cried out when the opposition told him to hold his peace.
    <br>He feared not.
    <br>They shouted at him, "Hold your peace!"
    <br>He refused to fear the opposition.
    <br>Millions have submitted to their fear.
    <br>We shall take our reading from the Book of 2 Kings chapter 6.
    <br>I will read verse 1 and verse 16.
    <br>"The company of the prophets said to Elisha, 'Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us.
    <br>Let us go to the Jordan where each of us can get a pole;
    <br>and let us build a place there for us to live.'"
    <br>Let me take you to verse 16.
    <br>"'Don't be afraid,' the prophet answered. 'Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.'
    <br>And Elisha prayed, 'O Lord, open his eyes so he may see.'
    <br>Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills
    <br>full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha."
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Let someone say: Fear not.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Fear not. Amen.
    <br>By word, what Elisha said to his servant, is spoken to all faithful Christians,
    <br>all faithful servants of God, all born again,
    <br>when without are fighting, within are fears.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus!" - within fear.
    <br>Fear not.
    <br>Those who are with us, fighting for us, protecting us, are more than those who are against us, to destroy us.
    <br>The angels unspeakably more numerous, God infinitely more powerful.
    <br>When we cannot see beyond our immediate situation, we begin to panic.
    <br>When we are magnifying the causes of our fear, we ought to possess
    <br>ourselves with clear and great and high thoughts of God and the invisible world.
    <br>Open with me the book of Romans 8 verse 31.
    <br>"What, then, shall we say in response to this?
    <br>If God is for us, who can be against us?"
    <br>If God is for us, you know what follows.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If God is for me, I know what follows.
    <br>Let's go to the book of Isaiah 43 from verse 1,
    <br>"But now, this is what the Lord says - He who created you, O Jacob,
    <br>He who formed you, O Israel: 'Fear not, for I have redeemed you ...'"
    <br>Verse 2.
    <br>"When you pass through the water, I will be with you ..."
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If God is for me, I know what follows.
    <br>If I pass through the waters, He will be with me.
    <br>Every mountain, for our sake, shall be levelled.
    <br>The hill will be become a plain.
    <br>When we walk through fire, we will not be burnt.
    <br>Rise up and begin to confess this right now.
    <br>If God be for me, every mountain shall be levelled;
    <br>the hill will become a plain.
    <br>If I pass through fire, I will not be burnt.
    <br>Begin to confess this right now.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>2 Kings 6 verse 16 - "Don't be afraid".
    <br>For a master to say, "Don't be afraid" - this is the master telling his servant, "Don't be afraid".
    <br>That shows he is sure of his security.
    <br>He is sure of assurance.
    <br>He is sure of inner joy.
    <br>He is sure of ease of heart.
    <br>Elisha saw himself safe and wished that his servant might see what he saw.
    <br>"Oh, it is a pity. Look at this boy.". "You need to see what I'm looking at."
    <br>He prayed for him, "Lord, open his eyes that he may see."
    <br>When the eyes of our body are open, we see danger,
    <br>we see what our situation has to say.
    <br>It is one thing for the eyes of the body to open, and another thing for the eyes of our faith to open.
    <br>These are two different things.
    <br>"These are chariots!"
    <br>The eyes of his body were open and he saw danger.
    <br>Elisha prayed and the Lord opened his eyes of faith that he may see the protection they were under.
    <br>Let someone say: The protection we are under.
    <br>You must know that we are under His eyes.
    <br>In Exodus 14, take your reading from verse 14. It says that God will fight for you.
    <br>In other words,  when you see the Lord fight for you, you will regret your complaint.
    <br>When you see the Lord fighting for you, you will hold your peace.
    <br>You will quiet down.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Ask God to open the eyes of your faith that you may see the protection we are under. Prayer.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>We shall pray as Elisha did,
    <br>so that the eyes of our faith will open,
    <br>so that we fear no more, worry no more, doubt no more.
    <br>Once you know God's will, God's opinion concerning your situation
    <br>- many of your situations here today are meant to preserve you.
    <br>It may look like evil, but there is no real evil in it.
    <br>You say, "I have sickness". Our own sickness is not like others.
    <br>Ours is meant to preserve us,
    <br>is meant to strengthen our desire,
    <br>is meant to keep us for a new level in life,
    <br>is meant to reform us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: My trouble is not like others.
    <br>My trouble is meant to keep me for a new level.
    <br>My trouble is meant to preserve me for redemption.
    <br>My trouble is meant to prepare me for the challenges ahead.
    <br>My trouble is meant to reform me for a better position.
    <br>My trouble is meant to keep me.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Don't because of your trouble, change your direction.
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>Don't because of your trouble, change your direction.
    <br>Don't because of your trouble, change your confession.
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>In every situation, God has something to say.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: God is still saying something.
    <br>I will not because of my situation,
    <br>change my direction,
    <br>change my confession.
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>I will not because of you,
    <br>change my position,
    <br>change my direction.
    <br>God is still saying something through you.
    <br>It may be to stop me awhile.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>What can God say through your situation?
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to preserve you.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to check you because you are going too far.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to keep you for a new level.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to reform you.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I'm walking with the Lord.
    <br>I'm not used to failure.
    <br>I'm not used to doubt.
    <br>I'm walking with the Lord.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Elisha was telling his servant, "You are walking with the Lord.
    <br>We that walk with the Lord, are not used to doubt.
    <br>We are not used to fear".
    <br>I'm walking with the Lord. Therefore, I'm not walking by sight.
    <br>I'm walking with the Lord. What is seen cannot dictate my direction.
    <br>I'm walking with the Lord. What is seen cannot change my confession.
    <br>I'm walking with the Lord.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>When the servant's eyes of his body were opened, he saw danger.
    <br>But when the eyes of his faith opened, he saw ...
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Elisha said of his servant, "Lord, open his eyes of faith so that he may see the protection we are under."
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to ask God to open your eyes of faith.
    <br>Open my eyes of faith so that I will see the protection I'm under. Prayer.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I want you to continue to meditate on this message:
    <br>that one thing is for the eyes of the body to open;
    <br>and it is another thing for the eyes of faith to open.
    <br>When the eyes of the body are open, one sees what your situation has to say,
    <br>but when the eyes of your faith open, you will see the protection you are under.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING!!!
