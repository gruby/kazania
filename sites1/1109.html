  <p>    
    <br>There is a brother there who has a problem with his marriage - you have a marriage problem.
    <br>You and your wife are there. Please, come out.
    <br>Don't be shy.
    <br>The couple whom the prophecy concerns comes out to confirm the words of the man of God.
    <br>You will not leave this wife. She needs deliverance.
    <br>She has a spiritual husband. Okay?
    <br>Amen.
    <br>And as for you, you know this is the problem you have been facing.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Disappointment has been your problem.
    <br>You always meet these people - spiritual husband.
    <br>This is not your first time.
    <br>You have experienced it in the past.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Disappointment is not from this woman alone.
    <br>You had disappointments in the past.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Even this one has a very strong spiritual husband.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Which one is "Amen"?
    <br>Whatever the man of God is saying is very true.
    <br>I am the man of whom the man of God said that I have a problem with the marriage.
    <br>I am a pastor and the speaker of the council.
    <br>My wife is here and she is having extramarital affairs.
    <br>It is disturbing my ministry.
    <br>Look! Did you listen to what I'm saying?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>When somebody has a spiritual husband, she is not your wife; she is somebody's wife.
    <br>Okay?
    <br>Yes, I understand.
    <br>It means, the two of you married this woman.
    <br>So, okay?
    <br>Help us, Man of God.
    <br>You said you are a pastor.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>Spiritual husband means, someone is in the spirit and you are in the physical
    <br>and the two of you married her.
    <br>Deliver us, Man of God.
    <br>How can you now claim that she is your wife?
    <br>This woman needs to be delivered. You will not leave this woman. Okay?
    <br>Amen.
    <br>She is a good woman.
    <br>Please, help us, Man of God.
    <br>This is what you are saying now -
    <br>you say, somebody is on the moon, somebody is on the sun, somebody is in the south.
    <br>Okay! You will be delivered. She is your wife.
    <br>Madam, how are you?
    <br>All her character and attitude is as a result of the spiritual husband. Okay?
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>If you don't deliver her and leave this woman, you will meet another one
    <br>that has two husbands in the spirit.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet.
    <br>So, don't worry. I want to be a part of your family. Okay?
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you. It's alright.
    <br>Man of God, please, deliver me.
    <br>Don't worry.
    <br>At The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers spirit-filled prayers to the people, in Jesus' name.
    <br>And whatever that is planted in their lives that is not of God is commanded out, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Among them is the couple who received the word of prophecy during the service.
    <br>He prays for them and delivers them, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Who are you in her?
    <br>What have you done to her marriage?
    <br>No marriage there.
    <br>This is my wife. The marriage is not okay.
    <br>The man of God prophesied that there is a man here together with his wife
    <br>who has challenges in the marriage.
    <br>I confirm that is true.
    <br>The man of God also said that my wife has a spiritual husband.
    <br>This is the manifestation of what the man of God has said.
    <br>Thank God for the deliverance.
    <br>No marriage here.
    <br>Why did you say, "No marriage"?
    <br>No marriage here.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Do you see a marriage here?
    <br>What did you do to the marriage?
    <br>No marriage; it is finished.
    <br>What did you do to the marriage?
    <br>It is finished.
    <br>How did you do it?
    <br>I destroyed the marriage.
    <br>How? What did you push her to do against this marriage?
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>Look at me alone.
    <br>Who are you to her?
    <br>I am the husband.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>When she was young.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>With just a touch from Prophet T.B. Joshua, the lady and her husband
    <br>fall under the influence of the Holy Spirit and they are delivered, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! My wife is delivered, my marriage is delivered.
    <br>We thank God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>CHANGING LIVES
    <br>So viewers, when God speaks, changes are beginning.
    <br>Let's get ready to hear from Pastor Mokoena and his wife.
    <br>Good Morning to you, program directors.
    <br>My name is Pastor Mokoena.
    <br>Usually in my country, they call me Pastor Tony.
    <br>The woman sitting beside me is my beautiful wife. This is Lerato Mokoena.
    <br>It has never really been easy in our marriage.
    <br>We have been married for 15 years now.
    <br>In these 15 years of our marriage, we only enjoyed the marriage for two years.
    <br>It has really been tough.
    <br>Now you can understand - being 15 years in a marriage and enjoying it only for two years.
    <br>The rest of 13 years - it has been a pain. Pain after pain.
    <br>I would go to church with a broken heart.
    <br>But I would keep on persuading, preaching to the people of God.
    <br>And really, it was not an easy journey for both of us
    <br>because firstly, when I met her, there was that love between both of us.
    <br>We cannot tell what happened during our stay together.
    <br>Sometimes, I would be preaching in church and she'd just decide to take her handbag and leave the church.
    <br>That thing would be disturbing the entire congregation.
    <br>But people are used to things.
    <br>Actually, nobody in church could understand what was happening with my wife.
    <br>Sometimes, she couldn't even clean in the house, she would just leave the house dirty,
    <br>the dishes would be filling the ... I had to do all this housework -
    <br>I had to clean, I had to wash the dishes,
    <br>sometimes I even had to wash the clothes.
    <br>You mean her clothes?
    <br>Yes, even the children's.
    <br>Sometimes, when the children were going to school, I had to prepare them to go to school.
    <br>Sometimes, this young man, my elder son - he is 12 now -
    <br>when he was still a baby and crying all evening, my wife would just neglect him.
    <br>I had to take care of the son and try to make him sleep.
    <br>It has affected me mentally, it has affected the church -
    <br>some people would just come and leave,
    <br>saying that there is no union between the man of God and his wife.
    <br>You mean, was it that evident, that people could notice that your wife was not with you in the ministry?
    <br>Yes, madam. People would see it.
    <br>As I am saying to you, when I approached the pulpit to preach, she would just take her handbag and leave.
    <br>Right in the church?
    <br>Right in the church.
    <br>In the presence of the whole congregation?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I would be so embarassed.
    <br>But because people came to church, there was a time, whereby I said,
    <br>"It is not about me but it is about the people of God who came to listen to what God is saying".
    <br>But the Lord really sustained us in the very same problem that we have faced in our marriage.
    <br>Sometimes, she could not even sleep with me.
    <br>She would just get off the bed and go to sleep on the couch.
    <br>It was a struggle.
    <br>Sometimes, people didn't understand. - "Why are you behaving in a manner that is not godly?"
    <br>They are not staying in your house; they don't know what is happening in your house.
    <br>And all they would do is just gossip and such.
    <br>Yes, gossiping and such - they would be pulling my name into the mud.
    <br>The church would be pulled into the mud. It was not an easy journey.
    <br>Some pastors - I would be there preaching on their pulpits.
    <br>They would see. Sometimes, people would talk to them, "There's no peace in that man's house".
    <br>I think at this point I would like to ask you a question, Pastor.
    <br>Going by the prophecy of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, when he gave you that prophecy
    <br>along with your wife, saying that your wife was being tormented by a spiritual husband -
    <br>tell us, what was life like - apart from the physical things you could see?
    <br>Did you experience any kind of attacks? With those habits she had - what was life like,
    <br>being tormented by this spiritual husband that possessed your wife?
    <br>Yes, this spiritual husband has tormented me so much.
    <br>In one of the years, the community called me to come and be part of the politics.
    <br>I just went there as a minister of the Gospel trying to assist the governor at that time
    <br>in the sphere of ministers' fraternal.
    <br>It happened, when her term finished, people wanted me to lead the community.
    <br>I accepted the call; I became a governor in the world.
    <br>It has never been easy in politics. I was hated all over.
    <br>But God saw me through until my term was over.
    <br>But before the term was over, there had been so many unrests in my community.
    <br>They wanted to burn my house, to burn the church
    <br>For what good reasons? Nobody can tell.
    <br>But by the mercy of the Lord, when my term was finished, I wanted to quit politics.
    <br>But the premier of my province said, "No, there is no need for you to quit.
    <br>We need people like you, we need ministers of God to assist us".
    <br>I accepted the call, I became the speaker of the council.
    <br>But still being a speaker, I was no longer handling a ward, whereby I interacted with people monthly,
    <br>except when we were going to do a public participation, where I would be assisting the ward councillors.
    <br>But this spiritual husband was still tormenting me.
    <br>People still wanted to... When you went on Facebook, they would be saying bad things about me.
    <br>They would be saying, "I must be removed as a speaker" - all those things.
    <br>But you can see that there was an evil force that has been pushing people to do such things to me.
    <br>At that time did you actually know that it was something spiritual
    <br>or you just thought that it was one of those things?
    <br>As I have been following Emmanuel TV, it came to my senses that there was a demon behind this.
    <br>I didn't even know that I would get used to such a situation.
    <br>Because it was hard on the street, in politics, hard in the house, church, meeting attacks -
    <br>I never had peace.
    <br>I think at this point I would like to ask madam:
    <br>Let's go back to the prophecy the man of God gave to you
    <br>during the service when he said that you had a spiritual husband.
    <br>I think the viewers would like to know, what it was like -
    <br>to be married not to a physical husband but a spiritual husband.
    <br>Just to confirm what your husband has been saying so far.
    <br>My name is Lerato Mokoena. I come from South Africa.
    <br>Coming to your question, I didn't have an idea that it could be that.
    <br>I knew we had a problem and, as he said, we both believed that there was a spirit behind it
    <br>but not specifically knowing what kind of spirit it was.
    <br>And when the man of God gave us the prophecy that this is a spiritual husband,
    <br>I could relate, I could understand that this is indeed what has been troubling us all our life.
    <br>Because I would always hear my husband complaining to me, "You are so loud,
    <br>you are so violent and you fight about even the smallest things".
    <br>His main complaint was that I was not submissive.
    <br>He would always utter words like, "There are two men in the house".
    <br>Yes, that's what I usually said.
    <br>I was saying, "You don't listen to me, you don't respect me, it's like we are two men in this house".
    <br>She behaved like a man?
    <br>She behaved like a man.
    <br>I would realise that he was not dealing with a woman.
    <br>He then became so abusive,
    <br>trying to enforce the respect and submission that he was requiring from me.
    <br>And I would still pray, I would still do what was expected of me like feeding my spirit
    <br>and I would go to church on sundays but during the week - no mid-week activities.
    <br>Can we say that at that time you were just doing those things
    <br>but your heart was not really focused on them?
    <br>At that time I thought everything was fine; I thought I was doing the right thing;
    <br>I thought all was still fine. But only to find out that I was just fooling myself.
    <br>Let me say, you had two faces then.
    <br>Maybe during this time you might be laughing but you were not actually laughing,
    <br>or going to the church, helping your husband in the ministerial affairs
    <br>and you were not actually doing that on the outside.
    <br>You had two natures which people did not really understand.
    <br>Yes, because I would feel that he did not want me there, he did not need my help.
    <br>Hence, I would stay back and not be involved in most of the activities that were happening in church.
    <br>Because in a way, the reflection I would have of him was that he didn't want me to be involved.
    <br>That was what came into my head.
    <br>From what you have just explained now, I think the viewers will understand
    <br>that this was basically two natures of madam and two faces because as she said,
    <br>people did not really see the deeper side of her, that there was something behind this behavior of hers.
    <br>I mean when she laughed, she was not actually laughing because there was a demonic influence somewhere.
    <br>A demonic force.
    <br>Because sometimes, when I was preaching, she would be holding her phone, playing with it.
    <br>Lerato, can I just chip this in?
    <br>Because at that time, when you were having this crisis in your marriage,
    <br>was it like a constant war in your heart - maybe one desires to do the right thing,
    <br>one desires to be submissive, then another voice would tell you, "No!"
    <br>and bring his wrongs to you - and that would make you react negatively?
    <br>So I think that is what Folake means by saying that you had like two faces.
    <br>Yes. At times I would just say, "From now on, going forward, I am just going to do what he wants.
    <br>I am just going to make sure that everything he asks from me, I will do it and I won't wait until he complains".
    <br>Especially concerning the issues that he was talking about - that I was not washing his clothes.
    <br>I would have a problem, especially with the underclothes. He would complain.
    <br>Even if I could do other things, I would not do them.
    <br>But at some point I would tell myself, "I am just going to do everything right,
    <br>I am just going to do the laundry, I am just going to do..."
    <br>But only to find out, it didn't happen. I didn't do it, and when he came home,
    <br>sometimes I would be apologising, sometimes I would be just quiet,
    <br>saying in my heart, "Why don't you do it yourself?"
    <br>That's what Prophet T.B. Joshua says that we don't have enough physical strength to fight satan.
    <br>Once the force behind it is satanic, demonic, physically we cannot fight this battle.
    <br>It's just by the strengh of God.
    <br>It's very true.
    <br>CHANGING LIVES
    <br>It has never really been easy in our marriage.
    <br>We have been married for 15 years now.
    <br>In these 15 years of our marriage, we have only enjoyed the marriage for two years.
    <br>It has really been tough.
    <br>Now you can understand - being 15 years in a marriage, enjoying only for two years.
    <br>I understand.
    <br>Sometimes, she would just leave me alone in the house and visit another town
    <br>so that she could not come to church on Sunday,
    <br>so that she could go to another church rather than coming to my ministry.
    <br>Sometimes, being a minister of the Gospel, you can assist people to grow.
    <br>Some would come to church without knowing how to play the keyboard, instruments -
    <br>you would find people to train them. Once they know - they think they know - they leave.
    <br>There were times when in my ministry, we didn't have a keyboardist.
    <br>My elder son would be helping me playing the CD, when I preached.
    <br>He would just put the CD and play it, and I would preach.
    <br>Do you know what was happening? To show that it was an evil force that was pushing my wife,
    <br>she would take the very same person who was trying to assist me in the ministry,
    <br>together with his younger brother, to another place
    <br>so that I would stay there alone and struggle with the work of God.
    <br>So can you just let us know what finally happened that she agreed to come with you to The SCOAN?
    <br>As I was saying, I had tried to persuade her to come, but she even said to me,
    <br>"I am not going to go to The SCOAN".
    <br>She told you plainly.
    <br>"I am not going to go to The SCOAN." But I kept on praying.
    <br>I had prayed a lot for us to come here. Sometimes, I would be fasting for 21 days,
    <br>praying for God's intervention because I knew, once we came here, solution would come.
    <br>Actually, we were at the edge of divorce.
    <br>But I just said, "Let me come to The SCOAN so that we can get God's opinion".
    <br>By the mercy of the Lord she ended up agreeing to come with me to The SCOAN.
    <br>And actually, a few days before we came, she was driving home after work
    <br>and she had an accident. And I told her, "No, don't worry about that".
    <br>We know, every time when we plan to go, all the spirits will be trying to fight, doing whatever.
    <br>She had an accident, her car got scratched, the person they hit - the mirror just broke and fell down.
    <br>She came home. And we were still struggling to find her passport.
    <br>So many things were just...
    <br>The man of God usually says, when you are getting close to your breakthrough,
    <br>then the battle becomes hotter.
    <br>So I think, from what you just said - that means that her deliverance started from home.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>If not, there was no way, she would have followed you to The SCOAN.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Sometimes, it even happens in real life, I mean in the world there,
    <br>you would just see some hardened, very tough criminal just wake up in the morning
    <br>and say, "Can you take me to Jesus".
    <br>What happened? You know, that nothing starts from outside the home - it must start from home.
    <br>Charity begins at home. That is why she agreed first at home.
    <br>And that was why she decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Lerato, I think I would like to ask you one more question before we wrap up.
    <br>At the time the man of God touched you, when you finally came here,
    <br>and after the prophecy, you were opportuned to be at the prayer line.
    <br>When the man of God gave you that touch, tell us - what did you experience at that time?
    <br>Immediately the man of God laid his hand on me, I felt so angry.
    <br>I don't know why.
    <br>When I was standing in the queue, I was anxious, hoping that this was my time to receive a touch.
    <br>But the moment he laid his hand on me, it was like he was provoking,
    <br>it was like he pushed a wrong button.
    <br>I felt like I didn't know what was wrong with me now
    <br>and what I can remember is that I felt anger.
    <br>Exactly! Because at that time - we could see from the clip - you were kicking.
    <br>She even kicked me!
    <br>You gave your husband a karate kick.
    <br>Karate kick? Me?
    <br>You were so unconcious of everything around you. You kicked!
    <br>And even the men around could not hold you!
    <br>How many men?
    <br>Can we say, like two or three men?
    <br>They were many there!
    <br>You were kicking.
    <br>I was very surprised because the very same leg that she kicked me with -
    <br>she had an ankle problem. So I was surprised. Today the lady is now able to walk.
    <br>You should ask yourself, "How come a leg with a problem was able to kick?"
    <br>To show you that there was another leg!
    <br>That was that spiritual husband's leg.
    <br>That's why when the man of God gave the prophecy, he said,
    <br>"Man, this woman, she has two men - you and another man in the spirit".
    <br>We saw that evil man manifest that day.
    <br>Yes. When I got the kick, I said, "No, that man is kicking me now".
    <br>Yes, that's true.
    <br>Going by that experience you had, you said, it just got you angry.
    <br>It shows that you sensed that touch from Heaven; that fire was upon you.
    <br>I believe so.
    <br>And it was that fire of the Holy Spirit you received through the touch of the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, that made you so unconsious of everything
    <br>because it was a touch from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It was the power of God that descended on you and made that demon to manifest.
    <br>And you became unconsious of your enviroment because you were influenced by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>So it was a great experience and we know that it was that experience
    <br>that has brought this beautiful smile on your face.
    <br>I really thank God for that moment. I can't explain how I feel now,
    <br>after that life changing touch - I will call it my "miracle touch".
    <br>What do you want to tell viewers about that touch?
    <br>Viewers, everyone needs that touch. Because even after that, I still feel that hammer on my head.
    <br>And when I went to bed to sleep, it was like I was a baby. I slept peacefully.
    <br>And I enjoyed my sleep. Even in the morning when I woke up, I felt so light and I thank God for that.
    <br>I don't have words to explain how my life is now.
    <br>Even the morning after my deliverance, I woke up with the joy of the Lord overflowing in my spirit.
    <br>The first thing I did that morning was just to call my husband to find out how he was.
    <br>I felt really like I missed him already.
    <br>I felt differently from all other days about how I feel about him.
    <br>And I thank God for that.
    <br>And how did you feel when you received that call - first of its kind in 15 years of marriage?
    <br>It was an overwhelmimg moment - something that I've been longing for for years.
    <br>I had always been complaining to her that if I didn't check on her, she didn't check on me.
    <br>It takes two to tango.
    <br>I felt so very blessed when she called me that morning.
    <br>One thing that she forgot to mention - immediately after that touch from Heaven,
    <br>the very same ankle that was having  a pain - that pain was gone.
    <br>She has been trying to check - the pain was no longer there.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>So it was not just deliverance from that spiritual husband.
    <br>Everything about her health was restored.
    <br>Yes, it was indeed. As we were staying there, we were going up the stairs.
    <br>Every time I would climb stairs - one stair with both feet, first one and second one.
    <br>The next one - the first one and the second one.
    <br>Every time I had to make sure that I started with the right one and pulled the aching one.
    <br>But now I am able to climb up and down the stairs without pain.
    <br>Even at night, I would be twisting my ankle just to check if the pain is there
    <br>but to the glory of the Lord, no pains until now.
    <br>And your children - have you heard from them?
    <br>Yes, we heard from them.
    <br>Even today we were speaking to them - they are all well.
    <br>I believe, when we get back home, we will be a joyous family together, we will be a happy family
    <br>to the glory of the Lord, we will do God's work together, holding hands and closing every rank
    <br>that was there before the deliverance and do God's work.
    <br>Folake, would you want to give us the question from our viewers?
    <br>Pastor Abraham and the wife, what you have shared with us so far has been very educative
    <br>and I believe our viewers have really enjoyed it - the experience you have shared so far.
    <br>We would like to ask you many questions, if you don't mind but time will not permit us.
    <br>We just want to take one of the many questions that have come in to our program today.
    <br>And it's from Pastor Eric from the USA and he is asking about the changes
    <br>you have both seen in your marriage after the deliverance.
    <br>Thank you very much for such a beautiful question.
    <br>After the deliverance, we are now eating together.
    <br>She can feed me, I can feed her which was the thing that was no longer happening.
    <br>We even study and read the Word of God together. We feel very blessed with that.
    <br>We will now be planning the future together.
    <br>It's nice. We are walking around here holding hands
    <br>which was a thing that was no longer happening in our marriage.
    <br>We thank God. Indeed, it's a new beginning of our marriage.
    <br>I'm drunk in love. I'm really happy.
    <br>One statement he said to me was, "I wish we can get married now.
    <br>We will do everything afresh now".
    <br>I think that this is really something that will highlight this whole thing,
    <br>this whole new beginning that we are experiencing now.
    <br>I will never stop thanking God for this revival
    <br>because now a new thing has been born and I will never stop telling my husband
    <br>how much he means to me and I will be that woman that he expects me to be,
    <br>that woman that is abiding by the standards of the Word of God
    <br>and do exactly what is expected of me as a woman, especially one who is married to a man of God
    <br>who needs my support, my prayers, who needs me beside him in everything he is doing.
    <br>So I have really made a decision that I will stick, I will be there -
    <br>as long as God is by my side, I can do great exploits.
    <br>Yes, we know that as Mrs Mokoena has made that decision,
    <br>God will definitely give you the energy for the distance.
    <br>We really thank God for this.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>On that note, we want to really thank you for coming and sharing this experience with our viewers.
    <br>We know they have also been blessed, touched
    <br>and their lives will never be the same by this your experience. Thank you.
    <br>We also thank you for the invitation.
    <br>Viewers, we have heard it all.
    <br>A relationship does not involve two perfect people.
    <br>I mean such perfect people don't exist on this planet.
    <br>You're very right, Folake. Because the origin of any relationship is God,
    <br>and if God does not release us and we quit a relationship
    <br>or reject anyone on account of their weakness,
    <br>we will quit the next relationship in the same manner and even the next one after it.
    <br>I think you're right, Ann. Relationship is all about beneficial cooperation.
    <br>Human relationship is very important, especially in an institution such as marriage.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>But I'm just surprised of what is happening all over the world today -
    <br>distrust, infidelity have been the order of the day in most marriages.
    <br>Exactly, Folake.
    <br>And I think we need to know God's time in this matter.
    <br>If you look at Malachi 2:16, God declared, "For I hate divorce". And that is God speaking.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>So what does this mean to couples all over the world?
    <br>It means that as a child of God, divorce is never the will of God for your marriage.
    <br>And when a situation like this arises, what do we need to do?
    <br>We need to dig deep and fight it through.
    <br>There are powers in this world that will naturally want us to be bowed down in bondage,
    <br>and if we fail to realise this, we will continue to fight the wrong battle,
    <br>we will continue to disengage ourselves from the wrong relationships,
    <br>we will continue to do the wrong things and affect our homes, our marriages.
    <br>So there are powers that want us to be bowed down in bondage - we must begin to realise this.
    <br>I personally have never seen where hatred would overcome love.
    <br>Never.
    <br>Love of God overcomes.
    <br>If you have the love of God in your heart, you will overcome,
    <br>just as Pastor Mokoena and his wife did.
    <br>So viewers, show the love of God in your relationship and you will overcome the challenges that you face.
    <br>On this note, we will draw the curtain on today's program.
    <br>From me, Anne - remain blessed.
    <br>And from me, Folake - stay in faith.
