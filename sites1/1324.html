  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>If I may call a brother there -
    <br>the brother that decided to abandon wife and children and leave home.
    <br>They didn’t know, you just abandoned home.
    <br>You left everything for them and ran for your dear life
    <br>because a ‘prophet’ or a ‘pastor’ told you that your wife was whatever you call her.
    <br>I will not join you to call your wife that.
    <br>Come out. You abandoned your wife and you are here today.
    <br>You abandoned your wife and your children at home – you are looking for ‘freedom’.
    <br>‘Your wife is the one in charge of this, your wife is the one who wants to kill you,
    <br>your wife is the one that made you jobless’ -
    <br>no, come and hear God’s opinion.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>My name is Godwin Ebhohimen.
    <br>I am the man the man of God prophesied about that has left his family.
    <br>I live in Abuja, doing business.
    <br>A pastor said my wife is the one bringing me down
    <br>because my business and everything went down the drain.
    <br>Even now, I am indebted.
    <br>Because of that, I decided to run away from them.
    <br>Nobody even knows where I am now.
    <br>I am the one the man of God prophesied about.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Godwin Ebhohimen.
    <br>The woman standing right beside me is my lovely beautiful wife.
    <br>Last Sunday, I happened to be in The SCOAN where the man of God prophesied about a brother here
    <br>who had decided to abandon his home based on what he was told by a pastor
    <br>that his wife was responsible for his financial misfortunes.
    <br>He said I should come out and hear God’s opinion.
    <br>So, I came out.
    <br>Really, the prophecy is true.
    <br>In 2012, I was living in Abuja, doing my business.
    <br>I am into frozen foods, while my wife and children live in Edo State; she works there.
    <br>Every month, I visit them.
    <br>In 2012, customs seized my goods.
    <br>Early 2013, they seized more goods.
    <br>In 2013, we had our third baby.
    <br>We went to a church for the dedication.
    <br>During the dedication service, the pastor called my wife and both of our families
    <br>and told my wife that she was responsible for my downfall.
    <br>The families were crying and talking about it.
    <br>I told them to calm down.
    <br>He said my wife talked too much.
    <br>I told him that I knew the wife I married that she didn’t talk much or keep friends.
    <br>We went home.
    <br>The battle started.
    <br>In my home, there was no peace.
    <br>Any little thing that happened, I would recall the prophecy.
    <br>I quit my business because of financial problems and started another business.
    <br>That one – a car business also went down.
    <br>I went into property; that business also went down.
    <br>Any time I had financial difficulties, I would refer back to the message of that pastor
    <br>that my wife was responsible for my financial downfall.
    <br>It got to a point that even my children were sent out of school, the house rent was not paid
    <br>- so many problems.
    <br>Whenever I thought about that message, I would just take my bag and leave home.
    <br>It would be months before I returned home.
    <br>Mr Godwin Ebhohimen & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I had a property in Abuja that I decided to sell so that I could travel and leave this country.
    <br>I put it up for sale but nobody would buy it.
    <br>After going to three different agents, the property remained on the market.
    <br>Early this year, when we had a quarrel again and the children were sent out of school
    <br>and the landlord was disturbing us, I decided to leave for good,
    <br>to look for a way to sell the property and leave the country and live my life.
    <br>I left my wife and three kids.
    <br>I was in Ogun State and came to Ajah.
    <br>On Sunday, I came from Ajah to The SCOAN.
    <br>I decided that as I was leaving the country, I would change my sim card.
    <br>- No coming back to your wife...
    <br>- No coming...
    <br>When you finally came to the church - what happened?
    <br>When I came to the church, my aim was to get the Morning Water,
    <br>to sprinkle it on that property and see if God would give me the grace to sell the property and get out.
    <br>When I came here, I had the opportunity to get the Morning Water.
    <br>As soon as I got the Morning Water, I danced and felt happy that I would sell the property.
    <br>As I was dancing, I heard the man of God mention my case.
    <br>I was a bit reluctant but something pushed me and I came out.
    <br>The man of God gave the prophecy and I was asked to wait.
    <br>As I was waiting in the evening around six thirty something,
    <br>I received a phone call while I was in the church from one of the agents
    <br>stating that she had a buyer who wanted to negotiate for the same property
    <br>that nobody had called me about since last year.
    <br>When that call came, I said, “Wow, this is God who is in control. God is really here!”
    <br>We just want to ask you a question.
    <br>You said the message came forth and it pointed to your wife as the architect of your downfall.
    <br>Based on the fact that you were experiencing downfall,
    <br>you had to relate your misfortune in life to your wife.
    <br>That developed hatred and you abandoned her and the children.
    <br>Ever since you have abandoned her and the children, before you came to The SCOAN,
    <br>was your life really good?
    <br>Life was not good because so many people who I was owing were calling me, here and there.
    <br>At a point, I stopped wearing my wedding ring.
    <br>She would call me and ask where my wedding ring was.
    <br>I would tell her that ‘ring’ was not the problem, that it was the heart that was the problem,
    <br>so she shouldn’t care about the wedding ring.
    <br>Life was really miserable.
    <br>After the prophecy you received from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua telling you that
    <br>you are wrongly accusing your wife - what happened afterwards?
    <br>After that prophecy, I was waiting to see the man of God as he had directed when a call came in.
    <br>It was that call that really confirmed it to me - "Yes, this is God speaking."
    <br>When the call came in, I was happy that God had located me.
    <br>I called my wife to tell her where I was.
    <br>That same Sunday, she called me around 4pm when I was in church;
    <br>I told her not to worry, that I was safe and OK.
    <br>After the prophecy, on Monday morning, I called her and told her that I was in The SCOAN.
    <br>Before the prophecy, any time she called you, you didn't want to give her any attention,
    <br>because you still saw her as the architect of your problems?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But after the prophecy, you intentionally gave her a call?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Why did you have to call her after the prophecy?
    <br>Because I believe and confirm the prophecy is true.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>Having heard from the man of God that you were wrongly accusing your wife and you were misinformed,
    <br>what is the state of your mind concerning your wife now?
    <br>Right now, she is the best woman on earth.
    <br>Immediately I called her, I went to search for where I had kept my ring and put it on
    <br>before seeing her face to face.
    <br>Once again, shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>What word do you have for your wife right now?
    <br>I have to beg her to please forgive me.
    <br>It was wrong information that was driving my heart.
    <br>Please, forgive me, my honey, my love.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ - put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Right now, we want to hear from our madam.
    <br>We believe she is shedding tears of joy, because old things have passed away, all things have become new.
    <br>Right now, ma, to the glory of God and to the shame of the devil,
    <br>tell us your name, who is the man next to you and what you have to say about what your husband has said.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning everyone.
    <br>My name is Mrs Ebhohimen.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>We are from Edo State.
    <br>We got married in 2007 – November to be precise.
    <br>Within that time, our marriage was very sweet and loving.
    <br>It was not until 2012, when his business went down the drain.
    <br>In 2013, we had our third baby.
    <br>When we went for baby dedication in our local church, I invited friends; our relatives were there.
    <br>When it was time for the baby’s dedication, I carried my baby, right on the altar.
    <br>Everybody had followed me there to celebrate with me.
    <br>All of a sudden, the man of God told the whole church that he had an announcement to make - a prophecy.
    <br>He said, “This woman you are seeing here is the architect of her husband’s financial downfall”.
    <br>I stood there, speechless
    <br>waiting for my baby to be dedicated.
    <br>After the announcement he made, the dedication continued.
    <br>When we went home, things went the other way.
    <br>I saw another man in my husband.
    <br>I could no longer see my husband.
    <br>He no longer enjoyed my meals.
    <br>At the smallest quarrel,
    <br>he would ask me how was I sure that I was not the architect of his financial downfall.
    <br>Since then, life had not been easy for me.
    <br>At times, he would just leave the house.
    <br>On my return home from work, I would not meet him there.
    <br>He would not even speak a word or give a dime for the family upkeep.
    <br>Then, I had borrowed money from many people because he had left me and my children behind
    <br>and I was left alone to take care of my kids.
    <br>My salary was no longer enough for me to pay the debts I owed.
    <br>I continued borrowing to the extent that my salary was exhausted.
    <br>I would go out and buy food on credit to feed my children.
    <br>We strongly believe old things passed away, all things have become new.
    <br>Though it wasn't easy, but all to the glory of God.
    <br>This is the day the Lord has made and you will rejoice in it.
    <br>We strongly believe that you are only reflecting on a past issue,
    <br>knowing fully well that God has taken glory - restoration and reconciliation have come.
    <br>The vision is very clear now and to God be the glory.
    <br>My prayer then was for God to vindicate me and take away the garment of shame from my life.
    <br>On Monday last week, I had a phone call.
    <br>I was told the call was from The SCOAN, that my case was mentioned
    <br>and they wanted to see me here, on Saturday.
    <br>I left Edo State on Friday and came here yesterday.
    <br>I met my husband; they told me the prophecy.
    <br>I was so happy that at last I had been vindicated.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ - put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>It is a clear proof that when all hope is lost, Jesus Christ revives our hope.
    <br>No one is hopeless whose hope is in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Having received and honoured the call and meeting your husband, ever since then,
    <br>what are the changes you have noticed to confirm that the Lord has come to stay in this family?
    <br>The first change I noticed was his wedding ring because for a very long time, he had not put it on.
    <br>When I saw him yesterday, he was wearing the wedding ring
    <br>and I knew that God had restored my marriage.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Having gone through all this, right now you are vindicated.
    <br>As a woman, we believe you are in the best position to advise women out there.
    <br>If not for your patience, assuming you would have also taken a nasty step,
    <br>today there wouldn't have been anything like reconciliation.
    <br>You bore the situation, you were able to be patient, to persevere until today,
    <br>that the Lord has brought reconciliation to the family.
    <br>What word of advice do you have for women out there, how to handle issues like this?
    <br>It wasn’t easy for me as a woman.
    <br>It was the grace of God that kept me in the marriage ‘til today.
    <br>A day came when he told me he was tired of me and that I should leave.
    <br>I told him that I was not leaving the home because God said the two become one,
    <br>that we did our wedding in the church and I would never leave him.
    <br>I told him wherever he went, he must come back.
    <br>This has been the faith that has been keeping me.
    <br>My advice to my fellow women out there that have been blacklisted and called ‘witch’,
    <br>I want to advise you that there is nothing the Lord cannot do.
    <br>The Most High who has used our Prophet T.B. Joshua to vindicate me,
    <br>will visit you, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>To God be the glory. Our belief is that they have keyed into this advice.
    <br>We believe this advice will go a long way to bring a reconciliation to many families,
    <br>and give hope to women out there, who are facing similar situations,
    <br>as the Lord has taken control in your life.
    <br>Let's hear briefly from your husband.
    <br>With all said and done, we believe you are convinced that the Lord is good.
    <br>What word of advice you have for men out there?
    <br>My advice to the whole world is that whatsoever the situation, difficulty
    <br>or name they call our partner, loved one or people around you, don’t be in a haste to act.
    <br>Search for the mind of God towards that thing that is happening.
    <br>God would surely provide an answer, in Jesus’ name.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>You heard it all; when you are in a haste to achieve something, you are likely to make a costly mistake,
    <br>that will pull you back if not down.
    <br>Having harkened to this word of advice, we also want to encourage you as a couple
    <br>having known that the Lord is good, and your coming together is for good, for better or worse,
    <br>if you go and maintain your relationship in Christ Jesus,
    <br>always have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Shortly afterwards, Mr & Mrs Godwin came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to testify to the goodness of God in their marriage.
    <br>Let’s listen to them.
    <br>My name is Godwin Ebhohimen.
    <br>I am the man the prophet prophesied about who abandoned his wife and children.
    <br>I give God the glory for locating me in that wonderful service.
    <br>Since that prophecy came, God has really changed my life.
    <br>I thank God that my family, my wife and I have been reconciled.
    <br>The love of God has started growing in our lives and I believe God that this reconciliation
    <br>that God used the man of God to bring to our lives is going to be permanent ‘til death do us apart.
    <br>I thank God today that God in His infinite mercy looked upon me and my family.
    <br>There have been great changes since this prophecy came to me.
    <br>I thank God for this prophecy.
    <br>I can see happiness, God’s love and unity.
    <br>We discuss things we didn’t discuss before.
    <br>Those are some of the changes I have started to experience.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God for what He has done in your life.
    <br>Tell us what is the way forward from here.
    <br>The way forward from here is for me to commit myself to God the more.
    <br>I pray God will give me the grace to serve Him in humility, righteousness and faithfulness.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>We want to hear a word from your wife as well.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Ebhohimen.
    <br>The man beside me is my lovely husband.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN through a call from the man of God, here,
    <br>that my case was mentioned here in a Sunday service.
    <br>Since the reconciliation, I have seen love like never before.
    <br>There is peace and joy now.
    <br>Anything my husband thinks in his heart, he will tell me, which he didn’t use to do before.
    <br>I give God the glory.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God for this beautiful reconciliation,
    <br>that God Almighty has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to perform in this marriage.
    <br>As you are here, and you are going back to your destination,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners have sent us to you with a cash gift of 100,000 Naira,
    <br>for your upkeep, future plans and endeavours, in order to support you,
    <br>to be able to succeed in whatever you want to achieve in life.
    <br>With it you also have one Mirror book for your spiritual growth.
    <br>I am shocked and overwhelmed.
    <br>I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners for this wonderful gift.
    <br>It is God’s grace for me to receive this.
    <br>I thank the Emmanuel TV partners and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>May God increase them.
    <br>May God increase his family, his ministry and his anointing, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen, glory be to Jesus Christ for what He has done in your life.
    <br>We know that this cash gift will go a way, in order to strengthen this family
    <br>and to make sure that you will be able to establish your family and your house in a right way,
    <br>for the glory of God.
    <br>We also want to encourage you to make God's Word the standard for your life,
    <br>so that everything you received here shall be permanent in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
