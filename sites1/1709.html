    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>Come on, brother.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>You have high blood pressure.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>- It has taken over you.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>You cannot reason, sleep or do anything.
    <br>You know this is what killed mama.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Some sicknesses are not sicknesses; they are curses.
    <br>- There is a baby boy.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Where is he now?
    <br>- Ghana.
    <br>- But he is not in your custody.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Cornelius Ogbu.
    <br>The lovely lady beside me is my wife.
    <br>Last year, I was here in the church.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua brought up my case and gave me two prophecies,
    <br>which are 100% truth.
    <br>He said about my heart that I'm having BP, which is true.
    <br>Secondly, he talked about my boy that is not under my custody, which is also true.
    <br>When he first said that there was a boy that was not under my custody,
    <br>I thought he was talking about one of my children; we are Nigerians residing in Ghana.
    <br>I thought he was talking about one of my children in Ghana, that's why I said, "In Ghana".
    <br>But when he said the child was not under my custody, I remembered that he was talking about a different boy.
    <br>The prophecy is true.
    <br>Some years back - that was around the year 2000 -
    <br>there was a girl I had an encounter with.
    <br>I was in Benin Republic by then.
    <br>The girl came with an issue of pregnancy.
    <br>I wasn't ready, so I asked her to abort it.
    <br>She refused.
    <br>Later on, she agreed.
    <br>I gave her money, she kept it and said she had aborted the baby.
    <br>Later on, she came with the pregnancy again - she kept the pregnancy.
    <br>Later, I went back to Nigeria.
    <br>When she gave birth to that child, I went there to see the boy.
    <br>After that I came back.
    <br>After 7 years, in 2007, before I got married, I went there.
    <br>I met the lady and her family.
    <br>I pleaded with her that I took up the child so that I could train the child but the lady refused.
    <br>I spent four days pleading with her.
    <br>I told her that I could not be coming to her place - it was too far; by then I was already residing in Ghana.
    <br>She refused.
    <br>Two years later I met my wife, I married her.
    <br>Since then I lost the contact, I have not seen the child until now.
    <br>And the man of God said, "I see a baby boy".
    <br>Is it a boy?
    <br>Yes, the baby is a baby boy.
    <br>Since that time you lost contact, you have not seen the boy again?
    <br>Since 2007 I have not seen the boy.
    <br>What happened after this prophecy?
    <br>After the prophecy, the church promised that they would follow it up, so I went back to Ghana.
    <br>We have heard from him, narrating his encounter.
    <br>We know that church is a ministry of reconciliation.
    <br>Immediately the prophecy revealed this issue in his life,
    <br>the man of God decided to take it up by calling for the child and the mother.
    <br>To God be the glory, they are here in our midst today.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>We can see a young man standing, and also a lady.
    <br>Can you please tell us who they are?
    <br>That is supposed to be the boy.
    <br>OK.
    <br>And the woman beside the boy - who is she?
    <br>That is the lady I am talking about - the lady in question.
    <br>- The boy's mother?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>My name is Musa Hadiza, I come from Benin Republic.
    <br>The boy beside me is my son.
    <br>And the man who just talked - who is he to you?
    <br>The man who spoke now is the father of my son.
    <br>- OK, he is the father to your son?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>We have listened to the woman.
    <br>She says her name is Musa Hadiza and the boy standing beside her is her son,
    <br>the very son that the prophecy revealed he was not under his father's custody.
    <br>What do you have to say? What happened?
    <br>You son is grown up now.
    <br>When was the last time the father saw the son and how did the whole thing happen?
    <br>At the time I was in Benin Republic, he got me pregnant.
    <br>When I discovered that I was pregnant for him,
    <br>I told him and he asked me what we were going to do about it.
    <br>I asked him what he meant by that and told him I wanted to keep the pregnancy.
    <br>But he told me to abort the baby.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>I said I could not go for an abortion but he kept begging me to go for it.
    <br>Finally, I accepted.
    <br>We went to the doctor's house where he agreed with him.
    <br>He told me that he had agreed with the doctor and he said I should come alone the next day.
    <br>I agreed and before he travelled, he told me not to forget to see the doctor.
    <br>When I met the doctor, I told him that my husband and I had agreed
    <br>that I should come and collect the money because we no longer want to abort the baby.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>I took the money and went back home.
    <br>That evening, he came back from his trip.
    <br>He asked me if I went; I said yes.
    <br>He asked if I did it; I said yes.
    <br>He asked again if I actually did it and I said yes.
    <br>After three weeks, he looked at me keenly asking me if I actually did it and I said yes.
    <br>After four weeks, I told him I did not do the abortion.
    <br>He asked me why I did not do it.
    <br>And I said that I did not know what I would tell God if I had died during the abortion.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>He was angry at first but later understood and agreed to keep the child.
    <br>We were together until the pregnancy was seven moths.
    <br>Then, he told me he would like to return to Nigeria.
    <br>He asked me to stay with his brother and left for Nigeria.
    <br>When he left, I gave birth after ten months of the pregnancy.
    <br>After I gave birth, his parents who lived there came and took care of me.
    <br>When the child was ten or eleven months old, he came back.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>He said his brother had squandered all his money and that he would send him back to the village.
    <br>He told me not to be angry and gave me 50,000 FCFA to take care of the child.
    <br>I agreed and he left me with his brother.
    <br>Since then, I never saw him again.
    <br>People would visit him in Onitsha and ask him why he had stopped talking about his son.
    <br>He would tell them to forget about it and the people would tell me everything he said.
    <br>I said, "No problem".
    <br>The child fell sick and I suffered so much with him.
    <br>That is how I have been suffering with the child.
    <br>The man I got married to is the one taking care of the child.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>So, you mean since the boy was seven years old, that was the last time the father saw him?
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>Yes, that was the last time he saw the child.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>My name is Raphael. Today is the first day I am seeing my dad.
    <br>I have been hearing of my dad several years ago but I haven't seen him.
    <br>Today is the first day of seeing him.
    <br>So, you are happy that you are seeing your dad at last.
    <br>Since you were seven years old, you were wondering how your father looks like, is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs. Angela Ogbu.
    <br>I got to know this issue after the prophecy.
    <br>I'm so happy - for God to reveal this issue to the man of God,
    <br>I believe that the same God will give him wisdom to put everything in order.
    <br>I want the right thing to be done.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You heard it from madam.
    <br>She said she never knew that her husband had a child somewhere.
    <br>She only got to know after the man of God prophesied about it.
    <br>Nevertheless, she is happy that God Almighty has revealed this
    <br>and all she wants is for the right thing to be done.
    <br>We know the right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>Sir, I want to ask you: Now, you have seen your child, what do you want to say?
    <br>The only thing I have to say is: Thank God I have seen the child.
    <br>I will take care of him.
    <br>I pray that God will forgive me and have mercy on me and my family.
    <br>Brother, you have heard it from your dad - what do you want to say?
    <br>I want to go and meet him now and hug him.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>We thank God Almighty for everything.
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>We thank God for everything.
    <br>Before you go, we can see some little ones coming around.
    <br>Can you tell us who they are?
    <br>These are members of my family - my wife and my children.
    <br>- These are the children you have with your wife?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- It means they are seeing their elder brother for the first time?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Are you happy your son has met the father finally,
    <br>and that the father has also promised to take full responsibility and care of your child?
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>Yes, I'm happy with everything the man of God said. God will give me the strength to bear it.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Family Reconciliation
    <br>Let's clap our hands for our Lord Jesus Christ!
