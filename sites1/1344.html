    <br>Praise the living Jesus.
    <br>If you're happy to be in the presence of God, put your hands together for our Lord Jesus.
    <br>If you believe today is your day, put your hands together for our Lord Jesus.
    <br>Yes, greet your neighbours; say, "You are welcome to the presence of God".
    <br>You are welcome to the presence of God.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we welcome you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You may be seated.

    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>The Bible says that the essence of true worship is in honouring God
    <br>with what our lives depend on.
    <br>Once again, I greet you all in the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>How many of us love the Lord with all our heart?
    <br>How many of us love the Lord with all our strength?
    <br>With all our quality time - how many of us?
    <br>All our localty and substance - how many of us?
    <br>Well, it is good to see the raised hands.
    <br>But you know the answer to this question is more of the heart and a call for self-examination.
    <br>Ask yourself, "Do I really love God?"
    <br>Now ask your neighbour, "Do you really love God?"
    <br>You can see that the answer to the question is more of the heart and a call for self-examination.
    <br>God is concerned about you.
    <br>The Bible says He is busy planting the seeds of what you are becoming, if you love in truth.
    <br>In John 17:18, Jesus said to all His disciples, believers, Christians:
    <br>As the Father has sent me, so send I you - to love one another, just as I love you.
    <br>This statement was a kind of commissioning in all believers, thus giving them a pattern of operation.
    <br>In other words, Jesus was simply saying:
    <br>As my Father has commissioned me to be a solution to everyone in trouble,
    <br>so have I commissioned you as a solution.
    <br>Every person you meet today is trying to change their life in some way
    <br>but they don't just know how to.
    <br>Some want their health to be improved; others want financial freedom.
    <br>No matter your status in life - are you rich or poor?
    <br>No matter your status in life - are you strong or weak?
    <br>Are you educated or uneducated?
    <br>Someone is waiting for a lifeline from you, for you to put a quality smile on their face.
    <br>Therefore, do not allow your social, political, economic, cultural or religious background
    <br>to rob you of your love for Christ - I mean your love for one another.
    <br>Today, we claim we love God, yet our heart is full of offence,
    <br>making it difficult to love one another.
    <br>That is why Jesus says in Matthew 25, I was hungry - you gave me no food.
    <br>I was thirsty - you gave me no water.
    <br>I was a stranger - you did not take me in.
    <br>I was naked - you did not clothe me.
    <br>I was sick in prison - you did not visit me.
    <br>On that occasion His disciples asked, Master, when were you naked?
    <br>When were you thirsty and when were you hungry?
    <br>Jesus replied: When you stood in the midst of the lowly, those who could not help themselves.
    <br>Maybe you only imagine you are in the company of the poor, the uneducated, the destitute,
    <br>the weak and disadvantaged people.
    <br>Don't be surprised when you eventually realise, perhaps too late,
    <br>that it was Jesus Himself whom you denied.
    <br>That is why I tell you that do not allow your social, political, economic,
    <br>religious and cultural background to rob you of your love for Christ.
    <br>I mean your love for one another.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Today we all desire to reap but the question is: What have we planted?
    <br>If you plant love, the Bible says, you will reap love
    <br>because there is no loving in truth that does not express itself in giving.
    <br>There is no giving in truth without receiving.
    <br>The Bible says that true blessing actually comes from giving.
    <br>If you truly possess love - which is one of the fruits of the Spirit - the nature of God -
    <br>you will not look to the other side when your fellow brothers are in need.
    <br>This is compromise.
    <br>Many today believe that they can only give out of abundance, when they have surplus,
    <br>when they have plenty, when they are healed,
    <br>when they are blessed, when they have a breakthrough.
    <br>But this is a false belief.
    <br>Ask the poor widow in the book of 1 Kings 17
    <br>and she will tell you that everyone has something to give, no matter how small or big.
    <br>That is why Prophet T.B. Joshua says and I quote:
    <br>Your idea of 'if only I add money' keeps robbing you of your blessings.
    <br>Your idea of 'if I were strong' keeps robbing you of your strength.
    <br>Your idea of 'if I were free' keeps robbing you of your freedom.
    <br>Your idea of 'if I had money, I would give to the poor, I would help the weak,
    <br>if I were strong, I would help the less privileged, I would help the weak'...
    <br>The danger here is that if you fail to help from the little God has blessed you with, more may never come.
    <br>If you fail to help from the little strength God has given you, more may never come.
    <br>Brethren, help and be helped, when you help for God's sake.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Help and be helped, when you help for God's sake".
    <br>Love and receive love, when you love for God's sake.
    <br>This will bring me to the title of my message: "The Secret of Abundance".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Secret of Abundance".
    <br>God is concerned about our growth.
    <br>Quickly turn with me to the Book of Galatians and that will be our first proof text for this message.
    <br>The Book of Galatians 6.
    <br>Let's take our reading from verse 6.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.
    <br>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.
    <br>For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption,
    <br>but he sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life."
    <br>Verse 9.
    <br>"And let us not grow weary while doing good,
    <br>for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.
    <br>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all,
    <br>especially to those who are of the household of faith."
    <br>Let us read that verse 10 together.
    <br>"Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all,
    <br>especially to those who are of the household of faith."
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>The Bible says we must do good to all, especially to those of the household of faith.
    <br>Those who are to receive must learn how to plant.
    <br>Anyone who plants, the Bible says, is conscious of the future
    <br>because he will find help if he ever falls on hard times.
    <br>Anyone who plants is conscious of the future
    <br>because he will find help if he ever falls on hard times.
    <br>Brethren, today is for planting and tomorrow is for reaping.
    <br>Patience is an important tool when you are planting;
    <br>you must wait for what you plant to mature.
    <br>Surely your seed will come back to you in a hundredfold.
    <br>Just as the Bible says in Psalm 37:25 that the fruit of the righteous extends to his children.
    <br>If you realise that what you do today, whether good or bad, extends to your children,
    <br>then you will be careful of what you are doing now.
    <br>If you are conscious that whatever you do today, whether good or bad, extends to your fruit,
    <br>you will be conscious of whatever you are doing now.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing, if you are to know a successful life,
    <br>you must learn to plant your strength, forgiveness, mercy, kindness, faithfulness and love.
    <br>You must plant them.
    <br>God is not so much concerned about what we have to give as the manner in which we give it.
    <br>If you are to know a successful life, then you must learn to plant your strength, forgiveness,
    <br>kindness, faithfulness, mercy, favour and love.
    <br>Ask the widow in the Book of Mark 12 and she will tell you
    <br>that giving is a real privilege when it is done in a proper attitude.
    <br>The Book of Mark 12 captures the irony of a situation where a poor widow is exalted
    <br>far above the high and mighty in the society - all because of her selfless generosity
    <br>The Bible says she was one of those without any legal, political, social or economic stature
    <br>but Jesus noticed her as she gave her true offering.
    <br>Even though she was in dire need, the Bible says, she never held back.
    <br>Her action shows an example of sacrificial giving.
    <br>She was the only one who understood the principle of unlimited love and faith.
    <br>Let someone say, "Unlimited love and faith".
    <br>She was the only one who understood the principle of unlimited love and faith.
    <br>- a poor widow.
    <br>God is most honoured in our sacrificial giving.
    <br>True giving is sacrificial indeed.
    <br>The word 'sacrifice' does not suggest a bed of roses.
    <br>When you give, when you release forgiveness, sometimes it will cost you some pain to do so.
    <br>Sacrifice does not suggest a bed of roses.
    <br>When you sacrifice, you must feel the pain.
    <br>It is better not to give than to give what is not important to you.
    <br>The Bible says that God is most honoured by our sacrificial giving
    <br>but He is dishonoured by our offering of convenience.
    <br>We want to do it at our time.
    <br>We want to do it when we wish to do it.
    <br>We want to do it in our own way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, ask Joseph in the Book of Genesis 41 - when you have the time, read it.
    <br>Ask Joseph in that Book of Genesis 41 and he will tell you
    <br>that whatever is in your hand right now is capable of changing the course of your life.
    <br>When he found himself in the prison, the Bible says, he never waited for a more convenient time
    <br>to show himself as a commissioned solution provider, even in pain and suffering.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing, brethren - whether you are happy or not -
    <br>you must always remember that weeping must not hinder your sowing.
    <br>No matter what your situation looks like, no matter how you feel,
    <br>brethren, weeping must not hinder your sowing.
    <br>Remember the beauty of life does not depend on how happy or youful you are
    <br>but how happy others can be because of you.
    <br>This was what Joseph realised;
    <br>he realised that sowing seeds in faith is using what God has given to obtain what God has promised.
    <br>That is why he released forgiveness, even when he found himself in prison. 
    <br>Joseph released forgiveness. The Bible says, his gift, his talent ushered him to the throne;
    <br>his gift, his talent ushered him to his divine destiny.
    <br>It therefore implies that there is no one that God has created without a gift.
    <br>There is no one that God has created without a talent.
    <br>Brethren, your care to the lonely,
    <br>viewers all over the world, your concern for the weak,
    <br>the forgiveness you show to others might be what they need for their recovery
    <br>and at the same time that might be what you need to plant to discover your own destiny.
    <br>The love you give to the needy, the compassion you show,
    <br>the concern you give, the forgiveness you release to others -
    <br>that might be what you need to discover your divine destiny
    <br>and that might be what they need to discover themselves.
    <br>That may be what they need for their own recovery.
    <br>It might be what you need to plant to discover your own destiny.
    <br>If you say you are weak, don't be surprised to see those who are weaker than you.
    <br>If you say you are poor, don't be surprised to see those who are poorer than you.
    <br>Whatever that is in your hand right now is what God will use to bless others through you.
    <br>Someone is somewhere in need of what you have in your hand for their survival.
    <br>The Bible says it is true we may not be equally gifted
    <br>but God has done it in such a way that we all have some strength to contribute to one another.
    <br>You begin to succeed with your life when the hurts and problems of others begin to matter to you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You begin to succeed with your life
    <br>when the hurts and problems of others begin to matter to you".
    <br>Remember the title of our message: The Secret of Abundance.
    <br>The Bible says that God oftentimes uses men as instruments of justice,
    <br>peace, kindness, love, patience, favour.
    <br>Brethren, God is concerned about your growth.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, God is concerned about your growth.
    <br>Today, many are not growing because they fail to realise that their future is connected to people.
    <br>Many deny their future from being reshaped because they never find joy or reason in helping others.
    <br>Many deny their future from being reshaped
    <br>because they never find joy or reason in releasing forgiveness, in settling differences.
    <br>You may say you are in the business of giving but there is nothing to show for it.
    <br>You may say, "I've been helping the poor but there is nothing to show for it".
    <br>You may say, "I released forgiveness but still, there is nothing to show for it!"
    <br>You may say, "I give everything I have to the poor but there is nothing to show for it".
    <br>Check the way and manner you give it.
    <br>If you have not seen anything, check the way and manner you give it.
    <br>When you give with pride and arrogance, you honour yourself and dishonour God,
    <br>thereby magnifying yourself above your Heavenly Father.
    <br>That is why it is difficult to see the results.
    <br>When you give with pride and arrogance, the Bible says we make ourselves creditors
    <br>instead of the debtors we are.
    <br>Remember, we are all debtors, being sinners; God is our Creditor, our Provider.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God is concerned about your growth".
    <br>God is concerned about our growth.
    <br>Finally brethren, let's turn our Bible to the Book of 2 Corinthians 9
    <br>and let us take our reading from verse 6.
    <br>"But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,
    <br>and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
    <br>So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity;
    <br>for God loves a cheerful Giver."
    <br>The Bible says, as children of God, when you release the seed in your hand -
    <br>it may be the seed of forgiveness, love, compassion -
    <br>the Lord promises to take the blessing in His hand and release it to your life.
    <br>If you release the seed in your hand, brethren,
    <br>the Lord promises to take the blessing in His hand release it to your life.
    <br>This is a divine principle of a bountiful harvest that the Lord has founded
    <br>in all believers who are in their occupation of destiny.
    <br>This is a divine principle of a bountiful harvest that the Lord has founded
    <br>in all of us who are in our occupation of destiny.
    <br>Remember, giving is not only in monetary terms - it may be your mercy, favour,
    <br>forgiveness, care, concern, compassion.
    <br>There are many people on the sickbed in the hospital.
    <br>Visit them, show them care, love.
    <br>Who knows - that might be what they need for their recovery.
    <br>Who knows - that might be what is needed of you to discover your divine destiny.
    <br>Whatever that is in your hand right now is enough to create the future you desire.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Whatever that is in my hand right now..."
    <br>Raise your hand and say, "Whatever that is in my hand right now
    <br>is capable of changing the history of my life,
    <br>is capable of changing the course of my life.
    <br>Whether small or big - it doesn't matter.
    <br>By doing this, brethren, you will discover who you are.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Unforgiveness causes us to ignore our offenders when they are in pain.
    <br>Many a times we see those who hurt us - they are in trouble.
    <br>We ignore them, "It is not my business.
    <br>Okay, you can see he is reaping the fruits of his labour".
    <br>Unforgiveness causes us to ignore our offenders when they are in pain, trouble;
    <br>it retaliates and rejoices when others are hurt.
    <br>It is hard for those with unforgiveness in their heart to release help to their offenders.
    <br>The Bible says, it is more blessed, more rewarding to help those who hurt you,
    <br>those who do not share the same faith with you,
    <br>those who cannot even give you back.
    <br>You can count how many times you have seen those who hurt you,
    <br>you have seen your offenders in trouble and you ignored them.
    <br>Don't be surprised when you eventually realise, perhaps too late,
    <br>that it was Jesus Himself whom you denied
    <br>Ask yourself: Do I really love God?
    <br>Let that question run in your heart: Do I really love God?
    <br>How does the love of God function in a man who only thinks, works with an empty and idle word?
    <br>Ultimately, the Bible says we are called to respond to all human needs for that is what love entails.
    <br>This does not, however, mean that our care for the needy alone is enough to bring us to salvation.
    <br>But the Bible says, it forms the basis of judging the level of our kindness.
    <br>Looking the other side when your fellow brother is in trouble is equay to rejecting Christ.
    <br>Brethren, if you are waiting for a more convenient time to release forgiveness,
    <br>if you are waiting for a more convenient time to help the weak,
    <br>to help those who are in need, that time may never come.
    <br>If you are waiting for the time when you have abundance, that time may never come.
    <br>What we give out of little means a lot to us but the Bible says it attracts God's attention.
    <br>I want to leave you with these thoughts in mind.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to leave you with this one thought in mind.
    <br>You will reap the full harvest of whatever you sow if only you persevere.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You will reap whatever you sow if only you persevere".
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of your heart, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
