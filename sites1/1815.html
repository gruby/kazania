    <br>Good Morning And Win Today
    <br>Good Morning, viewers all over the world, and win today!
    <br>Welcome to the Emmanuel TV Studios!
    <br>Viewers, we can see what is happening all over the world right now.
    <br>We are still in the midst of an economic crisis that has been triggered by this coronavirus lockdown.
    <br>A time like this was foretold in the Scriptures, and God is still speaking through His servant today,
    <br>revealing His opinion to the world at large.
    <br>Jesus powerfully excites and effectually engages His prophets to speak what He has put in their mouths
    <br>to prepare us for what is to come, to protect us from the backlash
    <br>and to equip us to be a solution to the problems of others,
    <br>just as the Bible says in Proverbs 29:18:
    <br>"Where there is no vision, people perish!"
    <br>Starting 12 years ago, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a series of prophetic warnings to the world
    <br>in 2008, 2011 and 2013 about the coming economic crisis.
    <br>Indeed, God confirmed the word of His servant by accompanying it, by establishing it.
    <br>The day will attest to the reality and fulfilment of the prophecy.
    <br>Let us watch the prophecy.
    <br>BREAKING NEWS
    <br>Where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>Let us listen to what Prophet T.B. Joshua said 12 years ago on Sunday, December 28, 2008
    <br>concerning the crisis we are in.
    <br>In a prophetic message, he warned us of what was to come in the future,
    <br>stating it was a LONG TIME PROPHECY, that there would be an economic crisis
    <br>that would humble everyone.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>There will be economic crisis.
    <br>You are to cut your coat according to your size.
    <br>Those of you that have surplus
    <br>whatever you can do now to live moderate...
    <br>The only way you can be saved -
    <br>if your treasure is in the hands of God.
    <br>There will be economic crisis - it's coming
    <br>and it's everywhere.
    <br>You will be forced to be humble.
    <br>There will be economic war
    <br>because there is not enough money to fight war.
    <br>There will be crisis in the economy.
    <br>Countries that rely on mineral resources like oil,
    <br>they should quickly look beyond oil.
    <br>I'm just telling you a long time prophecy, not immediate -
    <br>what you can begin to prepare yourself for now.
    <br>You that are into this - you have surplus now.
    <br>What can you do now?
    <br>Because this surplus will be forced to reduce.
    <br>So, you pray for the whole world.
    <br>Remember, trial is the soil in which faith flourishes.
    <br>You are a faith man. I am a faith man.
    <br>There is no fear.
    <br>As a faith man, there is no fear.
    <br>Trial is the soil in which a man of faith flourishes.
    <br>Three years later on Sunday, October 16, 2011, Prophet T.B.Joshua spoke further
    <br>about the economic crisis that was to come.
    <br>Let us listen to the words of Prophet T.B. Joshua nine years ago.
    <br>I said to you there would be economic crisis.
    <br>The war the whole world will face is economic war.
    <br>You will see every nation,
    <br>every country will come out
    <br>going on the street, protesting.
    <br>You have not seen anything - write it down.
    <br>Everyone will be humbled.
    <br>Those who rely on oil, mineral resources -
    <br>they should look beyond
    <br>because there will not even be enough money to buy oil.
    <br>There is something God wants to achieve concerning this.
    <br>God wants to achieve humility to the core.
    <br>He wants everybody to be on their knees,
    <br>every nation to be on their knees.
    <br>After that, the solution will come.
    <br>That is what God wants to achieve.
    <br>Whatever you have now, cut your coat according to your size.
    <br>If you have surplus now, please, that surplus -
    <br>whatever you can do now before that surplus will go away.
    <br>Because if you have too much,
    <br>people will be out there to attack you.
    <br>They will attack you physically.
    <br>The time is coming and it has come.
    <br>Two years later on Sunday, December 29, 2013, once again Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied
    <br>about the coming economic crisis worldwide where countries would become broke.
    <br>Let us listen to the words of Prophet T.B. Joshua seven years ago.
    <br>Cash flow - forget it.
    <br>People will be broke;
    <br>countries will be broke.
    <br>A single person can be richer than a country.
    <br>Your oil - you will drink them.
    <br>Whatever your country has discovered
    <br>in terms of mineral resources
    <br>and it has been a source of income -
    <br>causing corruption, causing fights,
    <br>people living flamboyantly -
    <br>those things - nobody will buy them.
    <br>The price will drop drastically.
    <br>So, I want to say to you,
    <br>we have to return to the farm -
    <br>fishing, cattle rearing.
    <br>This is where we are coming from.
    <br>We are to return there.
    <br>Welcome back!
    <br>Recall what Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied in 2008:
    <br>"Countries that rely on mineral resources like oil should look beyond oil."
    <br>He also prophesied in 2013 that the price of oil would drop drastically.
    <br>He said this was a 'long time prophecy,' and people would have enough time to prepare.
    <br>In confirmation of this prophecy, breaking news reported a few days ago
    <br>that the price of oil has indeed dropped drastically in the wake of the economic lockdown,
    <br>with the price of one barrel of oil in the USA falling below zero dollars for the first time in history.
    <br>That is a drastic drop, like the man of God said!
    <br>And in that same prophecy in 2013, he also was speaking to the nations:
    <br>Those people that are relying, depending on the mineral resources that are causing people to be corrupt,
    <br>causing fighting, causing people to be living flamboyantly - nobody will buy them.
    <br>He even specified; he said, your oil, you will 'drink them'.
    <br>Look what is happening today.
    <br>Indeed, we see the reality of this today, all over the world, especially here in Nigeria.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua equally prophesied in 2011 that in nations around the world,
    <br>people will go on the street, protesting because of the economic situation -
    <br>scenes we are seeing currently in nations including France and the USA.
    <br>In all of these prophetic messages, Prophet T.B. Joshua continued to stress
    <br>that this economic crisis would humble the world.
    <br>He prophesied, "You will be forced to be humble."
    <br>He said God wants to achieve humility to the core; He wants everybody to be on their knees,
    <br>every nation to be on their knees.
    <br>Indeed, we are all on our knees right now.
    <br>Remember the name given to this year 2020 - the year of humility.
    <br>On 28 December, 2019, while Prophet T.B. Joshua was at the prayer mountain,
    <br>he said this will be the year of humility,
    <br>and that the Lord will humble us with our challenges.
    <br>Challenges could be affliction.
    <br>He therefore advises us to come closer to God.
    <br>He also declared in the prophecy for 2020,
    <br>"Many sicknesses and diseases that leaders have been treating privately will surface this year.
    <br>They will become bedridden and many will not make it."
    <br>We have seen the realisation of this prophetic word in the first few months of 2020.
    <br>In the same prophetic message, Prophet T.B. Joshua said,
    <br>"Agriculture will help the economy because the economy will have a backlash."
    <br>Viewers, is this not what we are seeing right now?
    <br>"People should invest in agriculture. Let us farm to help the economy."
    <br>This is a message he has been giving consistently throughout the years -
    <br>the importance of agriculture to prepare us for the economic crisis that was impending,
    <br>the economic crisis we are now in.
    <br>Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua said, "Hardship virus is more dangerous than coronavirus."
    <br>That is the reality, and talking about the coronavirus and about the prophetic messages
    <br>that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua has been given -
    <br>viewers all over the world, I'm sure you'll remember that Prophet T.B. Joshua also gave a prophetic message.
    <br>He said that the noise of this coronavirus would be silenced by March 2020 -
    <br>that would be when the year of fear comes to an end according to God's timetable.
    <br>We have an article here that was published on Friday 23 April.
    <br>This is the article; it was published on a Polish news website in the Polish language (Poland is in Europe).
    <br>I have the English translation here also.
    <br>The title of the article is, "Did TB Joshua's coronavirus prophecy come true? The phenomenon of March 28".
    <br>This article is actually quoting a research published in Forbes Magazine.
    <br>This is the article in Forbes, also in the Polish language, and this is the article in English.
    <br>This research that was conducted talks about the 'March 28 phenomenon'.
    <br>I will just read out the key points of this article.
    <br>The article quotes the mathematician and statistician, Mariusz Gromada.
    <br>He is the Director of the Customer Intelligence Department at the Millenium Bank,
    <br>which is one of Poland's largest reputable banks.
    <br>He studied the worldwide data released by John Hopkins University
    <br>concerning the patients that have been diagnosed with coronavirus.
    <br>After studying all the statistics from around the world, he singled out the date, March 28,
    <br>as the date the cumulative growth curve of coronavirus was broken.
    <br>This article shows all of the graphs.
    <br>This was the projected growth of the coronavirus, but on March 28 there was a very clear-cut break
    <br>and suddenly the growth changed and started reducing significantly.
    <br>This was all over the world.
    <br>This is the graph from Europe; on March 28 it was expected to go this way but rather it came down.
    <br>This is also in Asia.
    <br>All of these statistics claim to show that the projected growth of the disease in these nations all over the world
    <br>was broken specifically on March 28.
    <br>This is why this website specifically related this to the prophecy of Prophet T.B. Joshua -
    <br>because he specifically mentioned March 27 -
    <br>the noise of the coronavirus would be silenced,
    <br>and the following day, they had confirmed that was the significant date
    <br>when the curve of growth of the people with this disease was broken.
    <br>What can we say?
    <br>Indeed, no word from God is void of fulfilment!
