  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>to all hearts that are in bondage - bondage of unforgiveness, bondage of envy, jealousy -
    <br>be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips - whatever hinders your deliverance,
    <br>right now, begin to give way, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Holy Spirit, rain on us!
    <br>Your power of deliverance, rain on me!
    <br>Power! Glory!
    <br>Glory!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I say to you, you disease -
    <br>Power! Out!
    <br>In your blood!
    <br>In your kidneys!
    <br>In your liver!
    <br>I say, "Out!"
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command it out!
    <br>Tell that disease, tell that sickness, say, "Out!"
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Rain, power of healing!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Rain, power of healing!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Prayer!
