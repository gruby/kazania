  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let us be seated.  Amen!
    <br>In fact, I don't where you start.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>My coming to your midst is just to lay a foundation.
    <br>I am here to lay a foundation, that today we start The Synagogue here!
    <br>The Synagogue has started here!
    <br>I have come to launch a good foundation for the church.
    <br>You should know that this man always say things in proverbs.
    <br>All the elders here have been hearing from a young age that Jesus is coming.
    <br>We have been expecting his coming up until now and we are still preparing for it.
    <br>The reason Jesus has not come is because he wants you and I to repent of our sins
    <br>because He doesn't want anyone to perish.
    <br>Have you repented?
    <br>The reason the coming of Jesus is delayed is because God wants you to repent.
    <br>Repent from you sin so that you will not perish.
    <br>By the time Jesus comes, you will not perish, you will inherit the kingdom of God.
    <br>Right from your childhood, you have been learning that Jesus will come like a thief in the night.
    <br>We have been waiting for the coming of Jesus.
    <br>The reason the coming of Jesus has been delayed is because of you and me.
    <br>Jesus wants you to repent; he doesn't want you to perish.
    <br>By the time He comes, he can carry you to eternal life.
    <br>If Jesus should come and you have not repented, the coming of Jesus in your life has no meaning.
    <br>In order for the coming of Jesus to have meaning in your life, you need to repent.
    <br>You have to repent today and accept Jesus.
    <br>So that when Jesus comes, you can join Him in the Kingdom of God.
    <br>So for me and my house - and I believe you are my house - we will serve Lord.
    <br>Clap for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Now we thank God.  Even if you want me to prostrate for you, I am ready!
