    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>No Longer Using Breathing Machine
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Marian Nwoye, I come from Nazareth, I live in Israel.
    <br>The person beside me is my beloved husband, Daniel Nwoye - he is from Nigeria.
    <br>The people beside me are all my beloved family - Nigerian family.
    <br>Mrs Marian & Family
    <br>Nazareth, Israel
    <br>We came here to give our testimony of what happened to us
    <br>on the second day, in Nazareth, Israel.
    <br>Before, when I was a child, I had asthma.
    <br>All my life I had asthma - it affected my life very much.
    <br>It affected my physical and social life.
    <br>I could not do sports.
    <br>Even when I was a child, I could not do anything that would require an effort,
    <br>because I would always have an asthma attack immediately.
    <br>And when I had an asthma attack, it was like I could not move.
    <br>I had to use a machine all the time.
    <br>In the night, I would be having a lot of problems sleeping -
    <br>I could not sleep even one hour straight,
    <br>because something would be like choking me.
    <br>I would be like breathless in the middle of the night: I woke up, I slept...
    <br>The asthma was affecting my life completely.
    <br>When T.B. Joshua came to Nazareth, I could not believe it
    <br>and my husband will tell you why.
    <br>We have been watching Emmanuel TV for more than 10 years
    <br>and we were not able to come to Nigeria.
    <br>Then, when we heard that he was coming to Nazareth, we said,
    <br>"God is sending him especially for us. He is coming to the place of Jesus' birth and living."
    <br>He was living in Nazareth for 30 years, and he came to visit us -
    <br>we saw it like Jesus Himself, His best messenger was coming to us.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>We had the privilege to be in the prayer line, the second day.
    <br>I was using the machine.
    <br>Even to climb down the stairs from the auditorium was very hard for me;
    <br>I had to use the machine all the time.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, something came out of me and I felt free.
    <br>I could not control it, I fell down.
    <br>When I woke up, it was like something heavy came out from me
    <br>and I could really breathe very well.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Since then, I'm jogging every day 1 hour, I'm having a good night sleep, and I'm having a good life.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Many times I was hospitalized; they would say, "Take this or that medication.
    <br>Take this machine - this is the only solution. You have to live with it."
    <br>It was unbearable - how can a child stay in the house and use a machine all the time?
    <br>As an adult, I could not move and they said, "There is no solution.
    <br>This is the only solution we can give you.
    <br>Take this machine inhaler and you have to live with it.
    <br>You have to reduce all efforts. You cannot do anything that would cause an asthma attack.
    <br>Asthma attack would be very difficult and there is no solution to it."
    <br>I gave up on any solution that "normal" medicine would give me.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>I want to say my advice for the people who are Hebrew and Arabic speakers all over the world.
    <br>It is exactly what I said then: Jesus is alive.
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Jesus still today performs miracles - He is a miracle-working God.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>I have lumbar spondylolysis - over 18 years I suffered because of this.
    <br>I cannot walk, I have suffered...
    <br>Healing is still taking place and glory be to God, the man has been healed.
    <br>You can see him exercising.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr Nwoye Daniel.
    <br>I'm a Nigerian living in Israel.
    <br>This is Dr Marian Nwoye - she is my lovely wife.
    <br>The people beside me are my family, my brothers and uncles.
    <br>The problem my wife had was difficulty in breathing.
    <br>The asthma caused her a lot of pain.
    <br>It 'crumbled' everything in the house.
    <br>At night, whenever she was unable to sleep, I would not sleep as well.
    <br>The problem also affected our children because they are very young.
    <br>Even in her job - she works in the ministry - the problem affected her in that area as well.
    <br>Every time she became worried, I always encouraged her to be patient
    <br>as God would take control.
    <br>She went to hospital where they gave her a breathing machine and told her
    <br>that there was nothing they could do anymore and that she had to live with the machine.
    <br>So, we planned to come to The SCOAN because we watched Emmanuel TV
    <br>and saw how God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to change lives, nations and the world.
    <br>After we watched all this...
    <br>It was my wife that introduced me to The SCOAN.
    <br>She was the first person to introduce me to Emmanuel TV in 2009.
    <br>You mean your wife, who is a Nazarene and an Israeli,
    <br>is the one that made you to know about The SCOAN in Nigeria?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>It was my wife from Nazareth that introduced me to Emmanuel TV
    <br>because she loves to surf the internet and that was where she got to know The SCOAN.
    <br>Then she introduced it to me.
    <br>Since then, we have been watching Emmanuel TV 24 hours a day.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Three days before T.B. Joshua and The Emmanuel TV team visited Israel,
    <br>we heard the announcement.
    <br>I told my wife it was for our sake that God had sent the Prophet to Israel.
    <br>So when the day came, my wife told me she had to be present for both days.
    <br>When we were placed on the prayer line, the man of God
    <br>moved close to my wife who was holding her breathing machine and inhalers.
    <br>She cried out for Jesus to heal her through the man of God.
    <br>She spoke in Hebrew.
    <br>After the man of God prayed for her, she told me that she felt something heavy leave her body.
    <br>Her lungs became free and she could breathe.
    <br>She took in a deep breath to confirm her freedom and everyone present was marvelled.
    <br>The whole of Nazareth was shaken by this miracle
    <br>because after Jesus, they had never witnessed any miracle - this is the first.
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>They began to agree that the Bible is real.
    <br>Everywhere we passed, people would stop us because they know her as a chorister.
    <br>We live in the South where she got a job but her family are from Nazareth and we were visiting.
    <br>She grew up in Nazareth.
    <br>Everything has totally changed.
    <br>Many people have been calling after watching the video of her healing.
    <br>They want to know if it is true
    <br>because they have never seen anything like that in their lives.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>My wife is healed and I am also healed.
    <br>I have a testimony as well because I was also placed on the prayer line that day.
    <br>I had a spinal cord problem for 18 years.
    <br>The problem used to come and go.
    <br>Last year, I was taken to an emergency room in the hospital
    <br>where they did an X-ray and told me I was crippled.
    <br>They told me that the only solution to my problem was surgery
    <br>because the bone in my back was compressing my nerve and it had caused me paralysis.
    <br>When they booked me for the operation,
    <br>my wife told me that she could not allow me to go for it because it was 50:50.
    <br>If it was not successful, I would be bound to a wheelchair.
    <br>My wife told me that we had to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>During that period, I saw the man of God in my dream and he prayed for me.
    <br>When I was placed on the prayer line, I was wearing a lumbar corset
    <br>which the doctor gave me for support.
    <br>I could not stand like this before.
    <br>At the prayer line, the moment the man of God was coming close to me,
    <br>I looked into his eyes and when he stretched his hand to pray for me,
    <br>I felt something heavy come out of me.
    <br>He touched me while praying for me, removed the lumbar corset and told me to get up.
    <br>Immediately, I got up and felt as light as a person that was born today!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>To be honest with you, I am very popular in Nazareth
    <br>because all my life I was a singer, soloist in the church so my face was familiar.
    <br>Many people would be inviting me to many churches, also traditional churches.
    <br>They would pray, but they never knew what the meaning of "alive" is -
    <br>the Holy Spirit who is alive.
    <br>They, and I myself, would be praying in a traditional way.
    <br>I didn't know what the meaning of "The Living God, The Living Holy Spirit" was.
    <br>When this thing happened in Nazareth, everybody knew it was me;
    <br>my family, friends, all the people that know me.
    <br>They were shocked because they know me and the problem I was having since I was a child.
    <br>They were amazed.
    <br>I am a living testimony that Jesus is alive.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I would like to sing a very beautiful song that came to me after I was delivered,
    <br>"Jesus has delivered me".
    <br>Healing testimony
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>It means that Jesus has delivered me from being enslaved by satan.
    <br>Jesus set us free.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>That was a wonderful rendition and we give glory to God Almighty.
