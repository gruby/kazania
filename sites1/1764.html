    <br>SPIRIT CONSCIOUSNESS!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>You are welcome!
    <br>I say, you are welcome in the name of God!
    <br>I can see in you the glory of God!
    <br>If I'm right...
    <br>Am I right?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>That what?
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>When you say, glory of God in you - it is simple to confess this.
    <br>If you ask everyone here, they will say, "I'm a Christian" -
    <br>but are you such in heart?
    <br>That is left for God.
    <br>That is judgement.
    <br>On the last day, the Bible says, "I will say, 'I don't know you.
    <br>I don't know you as a Christian and I don't know you as a child of God.' "
    <br>But everyone knows you as what?
    <br>Everyone knows you as a pastor, prophet, Christian, bishop,
    <br>but the Lord says, "I don't know you" because it all lies in the heart.
    <br>Who knows the heart of man?
    <br>The question remains:
    <br>Are you a Christian?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you a believer? Are you a child of God?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>[Are you a believer? Are you a child of God?]
    <br>So, you hear from your neighbour, "Yes, I'm a child of God."
    <br>Everybody knows you as a child of God, but on the last day,
    <br>the Bible says, "I don't know you."
    <br>That is an issue of heart.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>A man can be a Christian, bishop, pastor, prophet, deacon - just name it -
    <br>but not such in heart.
    <br>But not such what?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>But not such in heart.
    <br>We are made in our hearts to be like who?
    <br>[Jesus!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus!]
    <br>We are made in our hearts to be like who?
    <br>[Jesus!]
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>You are made in your heart to be like Jesus.
    <br>You can look oblong, round, beautiful, handsome, whatever you call it
    <br>but in our heart we are made to be like Jesus.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of Matthew 5:8.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Nowhere!
    <br>From His presence you can hide in sin, cover yourself with sin, impurity, unrighteousness,
    <br>you are hiding there - that is it.
    <br>Now, verse 8:
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
    <br>Read it again.
    <br>["Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."]
    <br>Again.
    <br>["Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."]
    <br>Think about it.
    <br>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
    <br>It means if you are not pure in heart here today, you are likely wasting your time.
    <br>If you are holding grudges, malice, hate, disobedience - you are likely deceiving yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Pain of the past.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>If you are holding grudges, you are likely deceiving yourself
    <br>because Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>We need the Word of God in our heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I need the Word of God in my heart."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I need the Word of God in my heart.]
    <br>Because the Word of God in our heart influences our conduct and our character.
    <br>The Word of God in our heart influences our conduct and our character.
    <br>You know what I mean?
    <br>There is so much battle going on in your heart - for and against.
    <br>"Who is this man? Look at this man. What is going to happen? Am I going to be healed?
    <br>I don't believe. I believe."
    <br>The Word of God in our heart influences our conduct and our character.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>As you are looking, your heart is just jumping because it is not stable.
    <br>There is conflict.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>"I just came here today to... I'm going...."
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>There is a conflict between faith and doubt, light and darkness, right and wrong, good and bad.
    <br>The Word of God in our heart influences our conduct and character.
    <br>Sometimes you want to go, you say, "No, I'm not going again." - that is the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>I know many of you might have given a call home
    <br>to tell your wife, brother, husband, "Please, can you throw that pot away?
    <br>I don't want to use it again. I want to accept God, Jesus as my Lord and Saviour.
    <br>What I'm seeing - Jesus is real."
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>That is the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>"Today, with what I'm seeing, what is going on,
    <br>I have stopped smoking. I will never lie again."
    <br>You start making that commitment while you are sitting down.
    <br>The Word of God in our heart influences our conduct and character.
    <br>Let's talk about how the Word of God can enter our heart and dominate our heart.
    <br>This is the Bible.
    <br>The more you meditate on what you read in the Bible -
    <br>I am not saying, the more you think - the word think is literal -
    <br>upper house is meditation; lower house is thinking - surface.
    <br>The more you meditate on what you read in the Bible and turn it over and over
    <br>and over again in your heart...
    <br>You know how to turn things over?
    <br>You put pounded yam, you pound it,
    <br>turn it...
    <br>Look at the saliva - can you see - I swallow it down to my stomach.
    <br>The more you meditate on what you read in the Bible...
    <br>Let me read a passage:
    <br>"He shall appear in His glory."
    <br>I meditate over it.
    <br>Not just reading; you take a Word - "He shall appear in His glory."
    <br>You take a pen, you write it on the paper, "He shall appear in His glory."
    <br>The more you meditate on what you read in the Bible and turn it over and over
    <br>and over again in your heart, the more your spirit acts upon it.
    <br>Because faith is of man's spirit - that is, of man's heart.
    <br>This is a teaching, preaching at the same time.
    <br>Many of you don't know what it means to read the Bible.
    <br>Read and meditate.
    <br>Turn it over and over and over in your heart.
    <br>The more your spirit, your heart acts upon it and the more the Word grows in your heart,
    <br>gaining supremacy over you.
    <br>"Let there be light!"
    <br>Some will say, "This is a dry season. How can there be light?"
    <br>You say, "No! The Lord says, 'Let there be light!' "
    <br>There must be light - supremacy!
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>We are talking of how to get the Word into our hearts
    <br>because the Word into your heart influences your conduct and your character.
    <br>You just need to know, by the time you leave here,
    <br>how you can continue taking the Word of God into your heart.
    <br>Your heart is very, very important.
    <br>We are made in our hearts to be like Jesus.
    <br>That is why people like me can travel all over the world
    <br>and do exactly what I'm doing in The Synagogue here, which you have seen.
    <br>I have been to many places all over the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>I travel all over and God uses me mightily, more than even here in The Synagogue.
    <br>And you have seen, because we are made in our hearts to be like Him.
    <br>Whether you are white, green, yellow, tall, fat, whatever face you have -
    <br>we are made in our hearts...
    <br>Your heart is very, very important.
    <br>What is the heart?
    <br>I mean, what is our spirit?
    <br>Our spirit gets inspiration and revelation from God.
    <br>Your spirit - I mean, your heart - is the part that gets inspiration and revelation from God.
    <br>Your head, eyes, mouth, nose, leg cannot get it.
    <br>Whatever you look, any part of your body cannot get it;
    <br>only your heart gets inspiration and revelation from God.
    <br>It is very, very important.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Take care of your heart."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Take care of your heart.]
    <br>I mean, take care of your spirit.
    <br>Take care of your heart;
    <br>take care of your spirit.
    <br>When you say heart, you mean your spirit.
    <br>It is the part that gets inspiration and revelation from God - no other part.
    <br>We are here today to worship God.
    <br>It is the part that worships God.
    <br>Your body sometimes dances like this - I keep looking at you -
    <br>all this body is just fake.
    <br>You see criminals coming to the church, beginning to dance.
    <br>You will not know that it is a criminal.
    <br>It is the heart, our spirit that worships God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[It is the heart, our spirit that worships God.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[It is the heart, our spirit that worships God.]
    <br>It is our spirit that worships God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[It is our spirit that worships God.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[It is our spirit that worships God.]
    <br>It is the part that worships God.
    <br>Look at your body - how handsome you are.
    <br>Oblong face, round face, beautiful woman, handsome man - it is only heart that...
    <br>TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEART
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>See what you are just doing now.
    <br>Because it is touching and you love it, you understand it,
    <br>"Thank you, Man of God, I'm going to do the same."
    <br>As a result of what?
    <br>Your heart has a spirit consciousness.
    <br>My heart has a spirit consciousness.
    <br>It is telling you, "Oh, what this man is saying is true." - it is your heart.
    <br>You never thought of clapping but your heart says, "Clap for Jesus."
    <br>It is your heart that prompted you to do that.
    <br>As for you - you don't know, you just find yourself... - as a result of your heart.
    <br>It has a spirit consciousness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[It has a spirit consciousness.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[It has a spirit consciousness.]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[It has a spirit consciousness.]
    <br>You know what it means?
    <br>"Ah, thou shall not smoke, and I smoked.
    <br>God forgive me."
    <br>At that moment, until you are forgiven, you feel so depressed, worried.
    <br>Even people will be asking you, "What's wrong with you?"
    <br>You cannot tell anyone.
    <br>Tension, pressure.
    <br>- "What has happened to you? Are you not coming to the party?"
    <br>- "What kind of party? Please, leave me!"
    <br>You are worried.
    <br>It has a spirit consciousness.
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>That is it! 
    <br>It has a spirit consciousness.
    <br>"I have just lied now.
    <br>I was telling the man that I will help him, I will give him 100 000 dollars."
    <br>whereas you have no money.
    <br>By the time you finished saying it, "Why should I say this kind of thing?"
    <br>Because of that you may decide to go to the mountain and fast for two days,
    <br>"Lord, forgive me".
    <br>It is not everywhere they can take you to, you can't go anywhere because your spirit will not allow it.
    <br>You only go where Jesus is welcome.
    <br>It has a spirit consciousness.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes, you have to say, "Amen!"
    <br>You listen to me - because of your heart you agree.
    <br>Discernment.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Through our heart God communicates with us.
    <br>Through whom?
    <br>Through your spirit.
    <br>Sometimes you position yourself; when you are going to church, you stand in front of a mirror,
    <br>comb this, you look at your mouth - as if God is looking at your body to answer you.
    <br>Through our spirit God communicates with us.
    <br>If you knew that, you would take care of your heart, your spirit.
    <br>TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEART
    <br>So much attention you give to the body.
    <br>Through what?
    <br>It is through what?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Through heart.]
    <br>God what?
    <br>[God communicates with us.]
    <br>Now you are going to the Mountain; through your heart you can get there.
    <br>This heart holding offences, grudges, unforgiving spirit -
    <br>there is tap water there and there is anointed water there.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[There is tap water there and there is anointed water there.]
    <br>Which one are you coming here to take?
    <br>[Anointed.]
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>You know this place?
    <br>You have your cup?
    <br>There is anointed water there and there is tap water there.
    <br>Which one are you waiting to collect?
    <br>[Anointed water.]
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>I hope I am not hurting you.
    <br>Are you okay?
    <br>Listen again:
    <br>Tap water is for those who hold grudges, unforgiving spirit.
    <br>If you are holding unforgiving spirit, grudges, pain of the past,
    <br>you will get there and get tap water.
    <br>You will drink very well.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>You will just see people that...
    <br>You say, "What is wrong with these people?"
    <br>If you are holding grudges, pain of the past, unforgiving spirit -
    <br>there is plenty tap water there.
    <br>You know tap water is drinking water.
    <br>Instead of going there, don't waste your time - there is drinking water outside there.
    <br>Please, holding grudges, unforgiving spirit, pain of the past - tap water.
    <br>A free spirit will get anointed water.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Everyone knows what they are going there to take now.
    <br>I mean, you can judge yourself.
    <br>"That woman has not forgiven this woman. She has done so much."
    <br>If you don't forgive her, you will not forgive God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you will not forgive that man or woman,
    <br>you will not forgive God."
    <br>A good example is your position now.
    <br>You know what you were saying in the past, before coming here.
    <br>This is a place about which you said, "Over my dead body."
    <br>And this is the place you have rebuked, cursed in prayer in the past in some assemblies.
    <br>But here we are today.
    <br>Forgive us, as we forgive those who...
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>If you think back,
    <br>you will remember that one or two of your friends in the past that died,
    <br>and you went to the funeral,
    <br>if you know what led to their death, you will know that you have done the same thing,
    <br>over and over and you refused to die.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Because of forgiveness, because you have forgiven, you were given another chance.
    <br>And you say you will not forgive your neighbour,
    <br>and you have witnessed a friend of yours that committed the same offence, sin
    <br>you committed many times and you are still alive.
    <br>You were given another time, another chance - here you are today,
    <br>worshipping freely, sitting freely and you say you will not forgive.
    <br>As you are going there, you need a free spirit to be there.
