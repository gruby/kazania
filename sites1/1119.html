    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't let this appearance take you off.
    <br>Let us celebrate the Being in my word today -
    <br>the Life, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Well.
    <br>Let us rise up and pray.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, let us pray.
    <br>We want to be one. If we are not one, we cannot move that mountain.
    <br>Now, we are going into His presence in a mighty way.
    <br>You must make sure your heart is not fearful.
    <br>You must make sure your heart does not comdemn you.
    <br>You must make sure your heart is in perfect fellowship with His living Word.
    <br>Be conscious that you are welcome.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be conscious that you are welcome".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Be conscious that you are welcome.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Be conscious that you are welcome.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Be conscious that you are welcome.]
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That root that keeps unforgiveness alive in you - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That root that keeps anger, bitterness, envy, jealousy, pain of the past -
    <br>be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You need a free spirit to follow Him.
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>No turning back
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need a free spirit to follow Him.
    <br>The Spirit of God cannot share with a heart full of unforgiveness, anger, bitterness,
    <br>pain of the past, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>That root that keeps pain of the past alive in you - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You know those areas in your life.
    <br>You know those against whom you are holding grudges.
    <br>Unforgiveness.
    <br>It is not always easy to forgive but we that are Christ's followers must follow His example.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>It is not always easy to forgive the pain of the past
    <br>but we that are Christ's followers must follow His example.
    <br>If Christ could forgive the people who were killing Him,
    <br>we can certainly find a way to forgive those who hurt us.
    <br>When we cannot forgive, we are hurting ourselves more than anyone;
    <br>we are destroying ourselves more than anyone.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you cannot forgive, you are destroying yourself,
    <br>you are hurting yourself more than anyone".
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[When you cannot forgive, you are destroying yourself more than anyone.]
    <br>Yes. You say, "Oh, that person embarrassed me! He insulted me!"
    <br>and you are holding that pain.
    <br>When you cannot forgive, you are hurting yourself,
    <br>you are destroying yourself and your future.
    <br>Any step you take, you take it into darkness, when you cannot forgive -
    <br>whether you are right or wrong.
    <br>More than anyone.
    <br>Nursing a grudge damages our heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Nursing a grudge damages our heart".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Nursing a grudge damages our heart.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Nursing a grudge damages our heart.]
    <br>Nursing bitterness, unforgiveness, anger, pain of the past - whether you are right or wrong -
    <br>damages your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Here you are.
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>I am content
    <br>In Your presence there is light
    <br>Expressions of Your love
    <br>Revelations of Your power and might
    <br>In Your presence I can bring
    <br>A love song offering
    <br>I'm in the presence of my King
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>A step towards His presence - you are moving to His presence,
    <br>you want to move to God.
    <br>Your heart must be free from condemnation.
    <br>Make sure your heart is not fearful, does not condemn you,
    <br>is in perfect fellowship with His living Word.
    <br>Be conscious that you are welcome.
    <br>"Yes, I'm welcome."
    <br>Hallowed be
    <br>Hallowed be Your name
    <br>Lord and majesty
    <br>Divine authority
    <br>Hallowed be Your name
    <br>That is it. Hallowed be Your name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your heart must not be fearful.
    <br>Are you sure you are conscious that you are welcome?
    <br>When your heart is jumping up and down, the pain of the past?
    <br>Are you sure you are here?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to your heart.
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>Amen
    <br>He has risen from the dead
    <br>And He is Lord
    <br>Every knee shall bow
    <br>Every tongue confess
    <br>That Jesus Christ is Lord
    <br>It's not too late.
    <br>You can reconcile your account now.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you sure that you are welcome?"
    <br>[Are you sure that you are welcome?]
    <br>Are you conscious that you are welcome?
    <br>[Are you conscious that you are welcome?]
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let God's Word abide in us.
    <br>We take our reading from the Book of 1. Corinthians  2:13-14.
    <br>Take your time.
    <br>And the Book of Philippians 1:27.
    <br>And also the Book of John 15:7.
    <br>And the Book of James 1:21.
    <br>And the last reading will be 1 John 3:20.
    <br>Let me just take that first book
    <br>and I will leave the rest for you to read after the message.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>1 Corinthians 2.
    <br>"And so it was with me, brothers and sisters.
    <br>When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom
    <br>as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God."
    <br>What is the testimony about God?
    <br>That is what I proclaimed to you.
    <br>"For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
    <br>I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling."
    <br>Verse 4.
    <br>"My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words
    <br>but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power
    <br>so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God's power."
    <br>That last verse - read it with me again - which is 5.
    <br>"so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God's power."
    <br>But today, our faith rests on human wisdom.
    <br>In the ministry of apostles - the ministry of Christ Jesus,
    <br>the spirit of man is the fountain of faith.
    <br>But today, our faith rests on human wisdom.
    <br>That is why we have not been seeing Jesus on the scene.
    <br>When we say, "Jesus Christ", where is Jesus Christ?
    <br>When you say, "Jesus Christ", you are to bring Jesus Christ to the scene.
    <br>Today, our faith rests on human wisdom.
    <br>Like I have given you - when you take your reading - the Book of Phillipians 1:27
    <br>and the Book of John 8:31 - you will get it clear.
    <br>And the Book of James 1:21.
    <br>And the last reading which is 1 John 3:20.
    <br>You have more.
    <br>Abide in the Word of God.
    <br>When you look around today, you will see that our schools, colleges, technical institutions
    <br>are for the moulding of the mind.
    <br>What do I mean by mind? - I mean, intellectual capacity.
    <br>This is what we are building.
    <br>We can see all over the world intellectual capacity.
    <br>All the knowledge we have has come through the senses.
    <br>And you will agree with me that there is nothing creative in the senses.
    <br>That is, there is nothing original.
    <br>Senses is about 'letter'. Where does the letter come from?
    <br>It is about 'letter' - "Jesus Christ".
    <br>This is why today, there is nothing original in reading the Bible without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Let me take the Bible to show you what I'm talking about.
    <br>See.
    <br>If I take the Bible because of my knowledge of the senses -
    <br>well educated or author - and I take it and read it -
    <br>Jesus this, Jesus that -
    <br>there is nothing original in reading the Bible without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>There is nothing creative, there is nothing original in the letter.
    <br>It is 'letter'.
    <br>The Bible without the help of the Holy Spirit is 'letter'.
    <br>The Bible without the help of the Holy Spirit is mere 'letter'.
    <br>You can only teach it, preach it but to bring Jesus to the scene,
    <br>or to bring the Spirit of God into our heart - no.
    <br>This is why there is a cycle today.
    <br>We read the Bible without the help of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>How little we know about building our spirit.
    <br>That is why we read the Bible without the help of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Unless today's church realises that the spirit of man is the fountain of faith,
    <br>that is when God - the Holy Spirit will be involved in our affairs -
    <br>the affair of the church and our life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>Unless today's church realises that the spirit of man is the fountain of faith,
    <br>that is when God - the Holy Spirit will be involved in our affairs.
    <br>If not, we are carrying 'letter', history.
    <br>That is why anyone can go to the bookshop and obtain a Bible
    <br>without being a Christian, without being a believer.
    <br>Just give money, they will give you a Bible.
    <br>When you go to many occult organisations today, you will see them using the same Bible
    <br>because it is a 'letter' without the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Without the Holy Ghost, it is a 'letter'.
    <br>Committing the Word to memory is valuable but does not do it -
    <br>I mean, does not bring Jesus to the scene, does not bring God's Spirit into our heart.
    <br>Committing the Word to memory - I mean, learning the history of the books of the Bible is valuable -
    <br>you can learn the history of the books of the Bible and become a lecturer, teacher, preacher;
    <br>it is valuable but does not do it - does not bring Jesus to the scene,
    <br>does not bring God's Spirit into our heart.
    <br>Learning the Hebrew or Greek words is valuable
    <br>but will not do it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Only one thing
    <br>will do it:
    <br>Our doing the Word, living it in our daily life, practicing it, trusting in it, acting on it -
    <br>that is our secret.
    <br>Only one thing will do it:
    <br>Our doing the Word,
    <br>practicing it, living it in our daily life,
    <br>acting on it- that is our secret.
    <br>The just shall live by faith.
    <br>Faith has given birth to all the great achievements of man.
    <br>Feeding on the Word is feeding on God's wisdom.
    <br>Feeding on the Word is feeding on God's ability.
    <br>Feeding on the Word is feeding on God's very life.
    <br>Feeding on the Word - for you to know how important...
    <br>As you feed on the Word, it cultivates, strengthens, builds faith into you, builds God's ability into you,
    <br>builds your spirit up, builds into you every attractive thing that you see in the life of Jesus.
    <br>Trust and obey
    <br>For there's no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>Than to trust and obey
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Controlling your meditation while reading the Bible
    <br>gives ability to control your conduct and your speech.
    <br>Yielding your heart to the Word of God makes the Word a reality.
    <br>When you yield your heart to the Word of God, it makes the Word of God a reality.
    <br>When the Word becomes a reality, you become God-minded and Word-minded.
    <br>When you become God-minded and Word-minded, in the morning,
    <br>your spirit unconsciously goes to Him for guidance and wisdom for the day.
    <br>Unconsciously.
    <br>You will just wake up and find yourself...
    <br>Your spirit unconsciously goes to Him for guidance and wisdom for the day
    <br>when you become God-minded and Word-minded.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you become God-minded and Word-minded,
    <br>your spirit unconsciously goes to God for guidance and wisdom for the day.
    <br>It is not an issue of "I have not prayed". How do you know you have not prayed?
    <br>It is a thing of the spirit.
    <br>"Wait for me, I want to pray."
    <br>Ah! Your prayer has become your job.
    <br>It is spiritual.
    <br>"Wait for me, I want to pray. Please tell him I'm praying."
    <br>"Hm, I'm praying. When you were calling me, I was praying."
    <br>It is becoming your job; not the Spirit's job.
    <br>When we don't know how to pray, the Spirit is helping our weakness.
    <br>When you become God-minded and Word-minded, in the morning,
    <br>your spirit unconsciously goes to God for guidance and wisdom for the day.
    <br>In the morning
    <br>Early in the morning
    <br>In the morning
    <br>I will rise and praise the Lord
    <br>In the morning
    <br>Early in the morning
    <br>In the morning
    <br>I will rise and praise the Lord
    <br>Good morning Jesus
    <br>Good morning Lord
    <br>I know You come from Heaven above
    <br>The Holy Spirit is on the throne
    <br>Good morning Jesus
    <br>Good morning Lord
    <br>I will enter His gates
    <br>With thanksgiving in my heart
    <br>I will enter His courts with praise
    <br>I will say this is the day that the Lord has made
    <br>I will rejoice for He has made me glad
    <br>He has made me glad
    <br>I am so glad
    <br>I will rejoice for He has made me glad
    <br>He has made me glad
    <br>I am so glad
    <br>I will rejoice for He has made me glad
    <br>When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.
    <br>You say, "Ah, what will I do this morning? I don't know what to do!"
    <br>"I don't know whether that business will be right."
    <br>"I don't know whether that man will attend to me."
    <br>"Ah, I'm worried. I don't know. Let me go."
    <br>When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.]
    <br>You just find that in the morning, you start laughing.
    <br>People say, "Why are you laughing?"
    <br>"Because I'm happy!
    <br>Things may look very rough on the outside but on the inside, I'm happy!"
    <br>Because you are feeding on the Word.
    <br>When you feed on the Word, it makes your way plain before you.
    <br>When you feed on the Word, the Word becomes a reality.
    <br>In a crisis situation such as sickness, disease, hardship, poverty, you will not be afraid
    <br>because satan, the cause of crisis, has been defeated.
    <br>When you feed on the Word of God, the Word becomes a reality.
    <br>In a crisis situation such as sickness, disease, hardship, poverty, setback...you will not be afraid
    <br>because satan, the cause of crisis, has been defeated
    <br>and Jesus gave you the power of attorney to use His name.
    <br>Look, you need to know! This Bible is demanding!
    <br>As you feed on the Word, you dominate circumstances around you - live above them.
    <br>The Bible says, "Cheer up! I have overcome!"
    <br>It is true!
    <br>You just need to feed on the Word of God.
    <br>If that Word finds its way, if that Word of God finds its place in your heart,
    <br>by its very nature, it changes you automatically.
    <br>When you are changed, you will be called to act, to serve.
    <br>You will engage yourself in His projects - that is, God's projects.
    <br>There are God's projects.
    <br>The projects you are engaging yourself in -
    <br>there are God's projects and there are people's projects.
    <br>When you are called to serve, you engage in His projects.
    <br>When you engage in His projects, you begin to know God's opinion about yourself and others.
    <br>You know Jesus loves you.
    <br>How do you know when you do not belong to Him?
    <br>You can only belong to Jesus by being filled by His Spirit.
    <br>Are you filled by God's Spirit?
    <br>When you are filled by God's Spirit, you are emptied of your own.
    <br>You cannot be full of God's Spirit and also still of yourself.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You.
    <br>To belong to Jesus, you must be filled by His Spirit and emptied of your own.
    <br>Let's worship Him.
    <br>You raise me up
    <br>You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    <br>I am strong when I am on Your shoulders
    <br>You raise me up to more than I can be
    <br>You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    <br>I am strong when I am on Your shoulders
    <br>You raise me up to more than I can be
    <br>When I am down and oh my soul so weary
    <br>When troubles come and my heart burdens me
    <br>Then I am still and wait here in the silence
    <br>Until You come and sit a while with me
    <br>You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    <br>I am strong when I am on Your shoulders
    <br>You raise me up to more than I can be
    <br>You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    <br>I am strong when I am on Your shoulders
    <br>You raise me up to more than I can be
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, the question - what is the state of your heart?
    <br>Because this is what we are talking about. You can't go anywhere without this heart.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart. What is the state of your heart?
    <br>The Holy Spirit cannot share with a heart full of unforgiveness, bitterness, anger, pain of the past,
    <br>bad feelings towards neighbours, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>So we are singing and dancing.
    <br>That is the question for you to answer now.
    <br>Ask yourself - what is the state of my heart?
    <br>We know it is not always easy to forgive.
    <br>We that are Christ's followers must live by His example.
    <br>If Christ could forgive the people who were killing Him -
    <br>"Father, forgive them", including you and I, "they don't know what they are doing" -
    <br>who is your Father, we can certainly find a way to forgive those who hurt us
    <br>because when you cannot forgive, the hurt on you is more than on anyone,
    <br>the destruction, failure, nightmare on you is more than on anyone - if you cannot forgive.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>When we cannot forgive, the hurt on us is more than on anyone,
    <br>the destruction on us is more than on anyone,
    <br>the failure on us is more than on anyone,
    <br>the nightmare on us is more than on anyone.
    <br>Who needs forgiveness?
    <br>When you cannot forgive and you are saying, "I'm right, I'm just, I'm justified" -
    <br>you say, "You are right", they insulted you -
    <br>that is what you are holding against your neighbour...
    <br>If you cannot forgive, the hurt, destruction, failure, nightmare on you is more than on anyone.
    <br>This is what we are facing today.
    <br>This is what churches are facing today.
    <br>Unforgiveness is the burden we have.
    <br>"That man is not good", "That woman is not good", "That church is not good" -
    <br>as if you are the founder and you are God.
    <br>Because of that, you hold a grudge.
    <br>That "that man is not good" does not mean you should hold a grudge against him.
    <br>That is more of a reason why you should be his friend, to make him good.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>That "that woman is not good" does not mean you should hold a grudge.
    <br>That is more of a reason why you should be her friend, to change her.
    <br>Can you face your neighbour and say:
    <br>"That you are not good does not mean I should hold a grudge against you.
    <br>That is more of a reason I should be your friend to change you."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, where are we going?
    <br>Where are we going now? Can you see that you are not free of all this?
    <br>You are here today. You have so many enemies - uncountable ones.
    <br>You see them as the enemy.
    <br>No!  They are not your enemies!
    <br>They are to build you, mould you and reform you.
    <br>Those you call enemies are to build you, mould you and reform you.
    <br>How? They will make you pray the more, fast the more.
    <br>Hm. Over to you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If someone makes you pray the more, is he your enemy?
    <br>If somebody makes you fast the more, you call him enemy?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If not the attack of the past, you cannot be strong like this.
    <br>You are strong in the Lord because of attack.
    <br>You are strong in the Lord because of what people are saying about you.
    <br>But I have said:
    <br>Settle your conscience because your heart is the communication point, the contact point for God.
    <br>If God wants to come to you, it is through your heart.
    <br>If your heart is full of envy, jealousy, unforgiveness, pain of the past, bad feelings towards others,
    <br>where would God come?
    <br>Your altar is your heart. Your prayer room is in your heart.
    <br>If your prayer room is dirty, full of unforgiveness and pain, you don't have a prayer room.
    <br>The altar you have at home is just cosmetic.
    <br>My altar at home is cosmetic; the real altar is here.
    <br>Thy Kingdom come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
