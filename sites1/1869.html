  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, viewers, and Win Today!
    <br>Today, we want to talk about the cause of the pandemonium, the crisis,
    <br>the protests everywhere in the world today.
    <br>We claim to be our brother's keeper.
    <br>But viewers, let me ask you this question:
    <br>Are we truly our brother's keeper?
    <br>Because if we were truly our brother's keeper, the situation would not be the way it is today.
    <br>If we had been greeting each other, caring for each other,
    <br>loving, helping each other in spirit and in truth, God would be our rewarder.
    <br>But, is God our rewarder today?
    <br>All we are going through, all we are seeing today cannot be the reward from God.
    <br>This reminds me of a word of wisdom from Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>He said, and I quote, "It is more pleasant to do good to the ungrateful than to do good to the grateful,
    <br>for then we shall have God as our Paymaster, our Rewarder".
    <br>But today, we only seem to do good to those who are grateful.
    <br>We do good to those who say, "Thank you", to those who will appreciate us.
    <br>We do good with expectation.
    <br>We only care, give, love with expectation instead of giving in Spirit and in truth,
    <br>instead of loving, caring in spirit and in truth.
    <br>And John 4:24 in the Bible says, "God is Spirit. Those who worship Him must do so in spirit and in truth".
    <br>Meaning this, if it is not in spirit, it is not in truth, and so it is all nothing.
    <br>Viewers, quickly turn with me to the book of Matthew 5:45.
    <br>We will take our Scriptural reading from there.
    <br>The Bible says this, "For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good,
    <br>and He sends rain on the just and on the unjust".
    <br>Now, since God shines His sun on both the good and the evil,
    <br>He sends His rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous,
    <br>if we only love those love us,
    <br>if we only help those who help us,
    <br>if we only give expecting something in return,
    <br>what reward will we receive?
    <br>We have already received our reward.
    <br>That is the challenge today, viewers.
    <br>Today, we claim to be our brother's keeper but we help our brother with expectation.
    <br>Brother helps brother with expectation.
    <br>Father helps mother with expectation.
    <br>Neighbour helps neighbour with expectation.
    <br>Even nation helps nation with expectation, not in spirit and in truth.
    <br>And I repeat once again viewers, if it is not in spirit, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing.
    <br>The way we live our lives is the way we see it.
    <br>If you pour cold water in front of you, you will walk on wet ground.
    <br>As you lay your bed, so you lie on it.
    <br>That is what you are seeing today. That is the picture of our lives.
    <br>We begin to live a life of victory when those who pray for us are more than those who curse us,
    <br>more than those who want us to die, to be destroyed, to fail, to fall.
    <br>That is when we begin to live a life of victory.
    <br>Are you living a life of victory?
    <br>By our fruits, we shall know.
    <br>When your strength is more than your weakness, victory is as sure as the rising of the sun.
    <br>How can our strength be more than our weakness?
    <br>Good question, and this is the answer:
    <br>When we begin to live for others more than ourselves,
    <br>when we begin to serve others more than being served,
    <br>when we begin to spend more on others and less on ourselves.
    <br>That is the way to victory.
    <br>Viewers, ask yourself this question now:
    <br>How many people have I helped today?
    <br>How many lives have I improved today?
    <br>How many problems have I solved today?
    <br>Ask yourself that question.
    <br>Because many people need help, especially at this time of the sickness.
    <br>People need help, but they just don't know how to go about it.
    <br>Reach out to them, love them, give them, care for them without expectation,
    <br>for when you sow the love of God, you shall surely reap the love of God, as Galatians 6:7 says.
    <br>At this moment, viewers, join me in a time of prayer.
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>Is your heart free?
    <br>Is your heart at its best for God?
    <br>Because, today, when we love with expectation,
    <br>we often get disappointed and offended when those expectations are not met.
    <br>Expectation of certain behaviours actually sets us up for offence,
    <br>and when you harbour that offence, grudge, resentment, it damages your heart,
    <br>and ruins the success of your prayer.
    <br>Right now, whatever barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God - be removed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be it offence, resentment, unforgiveness, pain of the past -
    <br>whatever barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God - be removed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers, join me to acknowledge how much you need Jesus right now.
    <br>Say this with me - not just with your mouth, but more importantly, with your heart -
    <br>say, "Jesus is all the world to me.
    <br>He is my life. He is my joy. He is my all".
    <br>He is my strength from day to day. Without Him, I will fall.
    <br>Lord, though I am weak, fill me with Your power that I may do Your will.
    <br>Let me walk beside You, Lord.
    <br>Let me feel Your hand in my hand.
    <br>Let me know the joy of walking in Your strength, and not mine.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray!
    <br>Right now, by the power of the Blood shed on the Cross, by the authority of the Scriptures,
    <br>I proclaim healing to your body! Be healed, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I proclaim deliverance to your family! Be delivered, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I proclaim peace to your marriage! Be restored, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I proclaim freedom to your finances! Be free, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I proclaim blessing to your business! Be blessed, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers, regardless of what you are going through at this moment in the natural -
    <br>it may look very painful, troubling, rough -
    <br>the economic repercussions of the lockdown, what's happening around the world -
    <br>I assure you - don't be discouraged!
    <br>As a child of God, your dark moments are simply to prepare you for the future.
    <br>Your dark moments are necessary for you to see clearly where you belong.
    <br>Regardless of what you are going through in the natural, Jesus says you are delivered!
    <br>I can see God's hand of deliverance touching you right now.
    <br>Jesus says you are healed!
    <br>I can see the healing hand of God touching you right now.
    <br>Jesus Christ says you are restored!
    <br>I can see the hand of God restoring you, touching you right now.
    <br>Jesus says you are revived!
    <br>I can see the hands of God - God's hand of revival - touching you right now,
    <br>touching your business, finances, career, home, destiny, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Viewers, rejoice! It is well!
    <br>Be patient and wait for the physical manifestation,
    <br>and you will soon be sharing your testimony, to the glory of God, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen! "Thank You, Jesus" is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>Live a life of victory - what a promise for every true believer!
    <br>We thank God for this message He has given Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>Because through it, God is opening our eyes to see more of His truth.
    <br>And this is truth:
    <br>There are two forms of help - help for God's sake and help with expectation.
    <br>Today, we help, care, give, even love with expectation.
    <br>And if we help in this form, we should be aware that we have already received the reward.
    <br>Jesus says in the book of Luke 6:32-36 - and I will read -
    <br>"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
    <br>And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.
    <br>And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you?
    <br>Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.
    <br>But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back.
    <br>Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High,
    <br>because He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
    <br>Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful".
    <br>Viewers, listen to many in your community today, and you would hear people say,
    <br>"I helped that man when he had nothing. I paid his school fees".
    <br>"Remember when he was sick, I was the one that took care of him".
    <br>"I voted for that man, but his promises to me all failed".
    <br>Or, "That man used to be my domestic helper. Now that he is a big man,
    <br>he doesn't even remember who I am anymore".
    <br>These are confessions of weakness.
    <br>These are expectations of those who help with expectation.
    <br>Are you helping with expectation?
    <br>Viewers, I want to stop for a minute to confess.
    <br>Some time ago some of my colleagues and I were staying in the same apartment
    <br>and you can imagine what that was like.
    <br>Someone was always coming in or going out.
    <br>But one night we were all at home and I went to sleep,
    <br>only to wake up alone in the apartment.
    <br>I was surprised; there was silence everywhere.
    <br>I went from room to room looking for someone - anybody - but I couldn't find anyone.
    <br>And the first thing that came to my mind was, "They have left me all alone".
    <br>The next thing that came to my mind, "But I always tell them when I am going out. Why didn't they tell me?".
    <br>So, I locked the apartment and I ran to look for the prophet to report to him.
    <br>Viewers, I want to tell you something: Every meeting with the man of God is a message.
    <br>I sat down and I explained everything that had happened to him,
    <br>and he listened, patiently.
    <br>And then he looked at me and he said, "You live with conditions".
    <br>"What? I live with conditions? What do you mean?".
    <br>But it is true. I live with conditions.
    <br>I was among those who help with expectation.
    <br>I wasn't telling them what I was doing so that they would be informed.
    <br>I wasn't telling them for their benefit.
    <br>I was telling them what I did so that they would tell me what they were doing -
    <br>care with condition;
    <br>care with expectation.
    <br>But Jesus sees the heart; He knows the motive behind everything we do.
    <br>Today, we give and expect something in return.
    <br>Many of us who give to charity, give with expectation.
    <br>Many of us donors, donate with expectation.
    <br>Many nations help nations with expectation.
    <br>How many are actually helped for God's sake?
    <br>This is why the world is what it is today.
    <br>Many of us even preach with expectation, we teach with expectation, we pray with expectation.
    <br>And this is why many ministries are what they are today.
    <br>Viewers, look at this. This is my Bible.
    <br>The Bible is the history of God's people.
    <br>The Holy Bible is the force that makes it work or else it would only remain on our lips.
    <br>Without the force, we would teach and preach the Word with expectation:
    <br>expectation of money in the pocket and food on the table.
    <br>There are many things we are doing in this world today.
    <br>We think we are helping, caring, giving, even loving for God's sake,
    <br>but don't forget Matthew 6:4 - God, the Rewarder, is a Spirit.
    <br>Your reward should be of Spirit.
    <br>How?
    <br>The Bible says that when we love without expectation, we gain the love of our Heavenly Father.
    <br>To love without expectation is to show love without expecting love to be returned
    <br>from the one we have shown love to.
    <br>When you love without expectation, your love is being sown to the Spirit.
    <br>Sow to the Spirit, not to the flesh.
    <br>But today we expect to be greeted by those who are younger than us,
    <br>or by those we have helped in the past.
    <br>"Oh good morning, sir. Good morning, ma. Thank you for the help you gave me last time".
    <br>Why?
    <br>Listen, that he does not greet you does not make him your enemy.
    <br>In fact, he may be more of your friend, while those who are greeting you may be more of your enemy.
    <br>That he does not greet you does not mean he is not greeting you.
    <br>But this is the life that we live - a life of pretentious calm, a life of deceit.
    <br>We deceive ourselves by helping, giving, caring and loving with expectation.
    <br>Even the Psalmist lamented in Psalm 12:2,
    <br>"Everyone lies to their neighbour; they flatter with their lips, but harbour deception in their hearts".
    <br>Not everyone that loves actually loves.
    <br>Not everyone that cares actually cares.
    <br>Not everyone that helps actually helps.
    <br>Because if it is not in truth, it is not in spirit and so it is all nothing.
    <br>All we have comes from God and all we are to receive in the future will come from God as well.
    <br>What comes from Him goes to Him.
    <br>So, live a life of victory.
    <br>How?
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Father, may Your Spirit who dwells in our hearts be the voice of our prayer, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers, no one can love, help or care for God's sake without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Right now pray with me.
    <br>Father, Lord, I want every purpose of my life to be realised.
    <br>You are the Vine and I am a branch of that Vine.
    <br>My life flows from You. Only through Your Spirit will my life be fruitful.
    <br>Lord, let your Spirit take control.
    <br>Let Your Spirit take control, Lord.
    <br>Open their hearts.
    <br>Open the door of their hearts.
    <br>Fill their hearts with the fire of Your love.
    <br>Let them love not in word or speech, but in action and in truth.
    <br>Let Your Spirit take control, Lord.
    <br>Right now, command every spirit of addiction and depression out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command every spirit of pride and arrogance out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command every spirit of sickness and disease out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let Your Spirit take control, Lord.
    <br>Command every virus, infection or poison to be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command every damaged organ, every liver, every kidney, every heart, every lung -
    <br>begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command every disabled body - begin to move, begin to walk, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to move, begin to walk, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let Your Spirit take control, Lord!
    <br>I can see the Spirit of the Lord taking control.
    <br>I can see His healing! I can see His deliverance!
    <br>I can see His salvation taking place in your life.
    <br>Right now, rejoice, for God is in control, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>The evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed! Amen.
    <br>We have an email I want to share with you from one of our partners from Canada.
    <br>Let me read. It comes from Fred.
    <br>It says, "Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Please tell Prophet Racine
    <br>I want you to shed more light on the issue of tithes and offerings - on how to give them -
    <br>because I learnt that you say that you will not talk about the issue of tithes and offerings
    <br>so that it will not look as if you are forcing them.
    <br>Thank you, in advance".
    <br>Thank you for your question.
    <br>This gives us an opportunity to emphasise God's point of view on the matter.
    <br>Not that we will not talk about tithes and offerings; they are Scriptural.
    <br>We want it to be a blessing to you and the organisation you give.
    <br>Since they are things of the spirit, they must come from your heart.
    <br>No one reminds us of prayer because it is a thing of the spirit.
    <br>Therefore, offerings and tithes are also things of the spirit.
    <br>We must be conscious on how we talk about them.
    <br>For example, no one reminds us to eat if we are not sick, and this is food for the flesh.
    <br>But whatever we do in spirit and in truth must come spontaneously, not by force,
    <br>because our life depends on doing them.
    <br>Thank you. I hope I have answered your question.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!

    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Partners in Christ, Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>God planned the world
    <br>and the way different individuals contribute to the wellbeing of their fellow brothers.
    <br>Human society is built on this principle.
    <br>This means, a balanced relationship is a function of mutual giving and receiving,
    <br>with each one being willing to make some sacrifices as occasion demands.
    <br>This is a symbiotic relationship approved by God,
    <br>where the people involved benefit or gain from one another.
    <br>There are two kinds of people in this regard - givers and takers.
    <br>Grateful receiving and gracious giving come from the heart.
    <br>A partner in Christ is a giver; he is a supplier.
    <br>He gives whether times are good or hard.
    <br>For him, giving to those in need is a lifestyle.
    <br>Remember, everyone has received from God something that is capable of reproducing.
    <br>And when we understand God's divine principle of seedtime and harvest,
    <br>giving will become as natural as breathing.
    <br>Remember, a seed is powerless unless it is planted.
    <br>As children of God, when the seed in our hand is released,
    <br>the Lord promises to take the blessing in His hand and release it into our lives.
    <br>But, when we fail to bless or help people with the little God has blessed us with,
    <br>the supply for more may never come.
    <br>It is better to be blessed and so be on the giving hand, than to be poor and so be on the receiving hand.
    <br>This means, the secret of blessing is in giving.
    <br>That is why the beauty of life does not depend on how happy you are,
    <br>but on how happy others can be because of you.
    <br>How many people are happy today because of you?
    <br>How many lives have you touched today?
    <br>Remember, somebody needs something you possess.
    <br>It may be your love, care, money, strength or time.
    <br>The secret of blessing is in giving.
    <br>This is the responsible use of God's blessings.
    <br>This means, the value of blessing is to change lives, change nations and change the world.
    <br>Once again, thank you for your continued support for the needy.
    <br>Partners in Christ, we are a team.
    <br>The book of Matthew 18:19-20 says,
    <br>"When two agree, there is more to the 'Amen'".
    <br>Jesus Christ is the common centre of our unity.
    <br>This means, believing in Christ Jesus - that is our connection.
    <br>And when you are connected, you are positioned to attract God's attention for your life.
    <br>Right now, get connected and position yourself for deliverance,
    <br>healing, blessing and breakthrough, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Power and authority comes when we are not speaking or standing in our own name.
    <br>Jesus Christ of Nazareth has given us the power of attorney to call His name.
    <br>And when we call the name of Jesus in faith and in truth, Jesus comes on the scene.
    <br>When He comes, every mountain for your name's sake will be levelled, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, whatever spirit that is not of Jesus, hindering your life, tormenting you - I speak to that spirit.
    <br>You unclean spirit - leave my people!
    <br>Leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I speak to that spirit, I rebuke you!
    <br>Leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Spirit of affliction, backwardness, nightmares, setback - be cast out!
    <br>Be cast out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>What is your challenge today? Is it sickness?
    <br>Right now, it is time to speak God's healing Words.
    <br>In the book of Psalm 107:20 He said,
    <br>"He sent forth His word and they were healed, and He delivered them from the grave".
    <br>Whatever sickness is threatening your life,
    <br>whatever deadly disease - I command that sickness - come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I speak to that sickness and I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command healing on every damaged part of your body.
    <br>Your liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, skin - be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>What is hindering your life? What is hindering your progress in life?
    <br>When you take the name of Jesus, the way out for you has come.
    <br>When you acknowledge His name, the way out has come.
    <br>Right now, we pray, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever yoke of limitation, failure in your life - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be broken, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Whatever you might have lost - be recovered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever was scattered - be gathered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I speak to your business, career, marriage -
    <br>Be lifted up, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be set on high, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Give thanks to Jesus for taking you out of setback and poverty.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
