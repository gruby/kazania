    <br>WHO NEEDS FORGIVENESS?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>WHO NEEDS FORGIVENESS?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This will take you to the Book of Romans 3 and we will read the proof text verse 23 and also verse 10.
    <br>"As it is written: 'There is no one righteous, not even one'."
    <br>So I'm taking you to verse 23.
    <br>"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The question remains: Who needs forgiveness?
    <br>From the Book of Romans 3:23, one thing  is clear - all have sinned.
    <br>In verse 10, "There is no one righteous, not even one".
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>Whether victims or perpetrators, we all stand in helpless need of His divine forgiveness.
    <br>Whether you are the one who caused the trouble or pain
    <br>or you are the one who suffered the effects, we all need forgiveness.
    <br>Whether you are the one who caused the pain, the trouble
    <br>or you are the one who suffers the effects, we all need forgiveness
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Let me also take you to the Book of  Luke23:34.
    <br>"Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them...' "
    <br>Take note of the word 'them'
    <br>because it includes both the offender and the offended.
    <br>"Father, forgive them." Take note of the word 'them.'
    <br>This should be the standard of a Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This should be your standard".
    <br>This should be the standard of a true Christian.
    <br>And this should be your standard, if you are a true Christian.
    <br>This should be your standard.
    <br>He said, "Father forgive them."
    <br>Take note of the word 'them'
    <br>because it includes both the offender and the offended.
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Listen to that!
    <br>This should be the standard of a true Christian
    <br>because it includes both the offender and the offended.
    <br>Sin is never covered by our appearance.
    <br>Sin is never covered by our presence.
    <br>Nowadays when we come out as ministers of God, we put on a very big chain, this.
    <br>This cannot cover our sin.
    <br>Sin is never covered by our big Bible.
    <br>Some will carry their Bible with two hands.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sin is never covered by our prayer.
    <br>"In Jesus' name..." - no matter how much you pray or tears,
    <br>sin can only be removed by repentance.
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>What is repentance?
    <br>Repentance means being sorry for sin or wrong; it's not by tears.
    <br>It's being sorry for wrong, for sin, being committed to a new way of life, that of serving God.
    <br>Repentance comes when we stop blaming others.
    <br>When things go wrong, you look around and say,
    <br>"Oh, my business is down as a result of witches and wizards.
    <br>Ah, that grandmum, grandfather, done this, done that".
    <br>We begin to look, pointing our finger at others; looking for a scapegoat.
    <br>But when business is booming, it's our handwork.
    <br>"I don't sleep, I work throughout the night; as a result, I become a millionaire."
    <br>But a poor man will not say, "As a result of my effort, I became poor",
    <br>but a rich man - as a result of what?
    <br>I trust you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When things are not going well, we point accusing fingers at others.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Stop repeating stories of those who fail you.
    <br>Stop repeating stories of those who hurt you".
    <br>Stop repeating stories of those who fail you, who hurt you, who lie against you.
    <br>Stop repeating. That will not help you.
    <br>Your repentance does not agree with this.
    <br>Stop pointing your fingers at others.
    <br>"Yes, my boss sacked me, that is why I'm poor.
    <br>I don't know what I have done to my boss."
    <br>Stop thinking on your flaws, your trouble.
    <br>When we are offended, we feel hurt and blame our offender.
    <br>We always defend our envy, jealousy, anger, grudges.
    <br>We always defend to justify our reason not to forgive.
    <br>"No, I will not forgive because he is a small boy, he is my servant."
    <br>"No no, it's not possible for me."
    <br>We justify our reason not to forgive.
    <br>Message Title:
    <br>WHO NEEDS FORGIVENESS?
    <br>"No no, I'm older than him."
    <br>"I helped him. I sent him to university."
    <br>"Yes, I'm a boss. Why should this happen to me?"
    <br>We always defend our reason not to forgive.
    <br>Everyone has limitations - everyone.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you cannot forgive yourself, you cannot forgive others.
    <br>Since you have not forgiven yourself, you cannot forgive others.
    <br>You need to forgive yourself first, to forgive others. You have not yet forgiven yourself.
    <br>So where are we going? Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>Stop repeating stories of those who failed you.
    <br>Your junior ones, your this, your husband, your wife, your this, your that - stop repeating.
    <br>If you don't stop repeating, you will continue to have carryovers in your life.
    <br>And that is what is happening to you now.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You have carryovers".
    <br>'Carryover' means the trouble you had yesterday, you are still experiencing it.
    <br>The trouble last week, you are still in it. That is 'carryover'.
    <br>When you have carryovers, you cannot enjoy today's grace.
    <br>You know in your university days - 'carryover', you know what it means.
    <br>You study with your mate, you go back to your junior too, you study with them.
    <br>You go back again to your first year; you go back to the junior class to study.
    <br>When you are studying now, they don't know whether you are a senior or a junior.
    <br>What a humiliation.
    <br>You are living a carryover life because you keep repeating the stories of those who failed you,
    <br>stories of those who hurt you.
    <br>That is the life you are living now - carryover.
    <br>You carry the trouble yesterday and carry the trouble today and you are not destined like that.
    <br>You are only destined to face the trouble today.
    <br>The grace today is for today.
    <br>You carry yesterday's trouble and carry today's trouble.
    <br>Today's grace is for today.
    <br>This is the case with you.
    <br>You heard what Jesus said; I repeat again.
    <br>He said, "Father forgive them".
    <br>Take note  of the word 'them'.
    <br>The word 'them' means the offender and the offended,
    <br>the one that caused the trouble and also the one that suffered the effects.
    <br>I want to pray with you. Thank you.
    <br>This is for you so that you will be able to maintain your blessing.
    <br>You just have to live and let others live.

    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went

    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken

    <br>Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.]
    <br>Because when we say, "Let's pray...",
    <br>it is faith that counts.
    <br>All this "Jesus!" without faith, you are talking to yourself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.]
    <br>Yes!
    <br>It is faith that counts!
    <br>All this praying, "In the name of Jesus!" -
    <br>that is why you cannot give account of your prayer.
    <br>Don't be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith, because it is faith that counts.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen to me.
    <br>I will not pray with you if I am not receiving an order.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sin must be brought to the Blood of Jesus before the Spirit prays through us.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Sin must be brought to the Blood of Jesus before the Spirit prays through us.
    <br>The Blood of Jesus
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>The Blood of Jesus
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>Do you understand what I'm saying now?
    <br>You are the one singing it but you don't know what you are saying.
    <br>Our sin must be brought to the Blood of Christ before the Spirit prays through us.
    <br>This is where faith counts.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus, from all hurt, deep hurt, envy, jealousy, anger.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus, from all hurt, deep hurt, anger, envy, jealousy!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>If you are not released from all this and we are praying,
    <br>you can receive but it will not be permanent.
    <br>You can receive a miracle but to keep that miracle, you must be a member of Christ's home.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus, from all hurt, deep hurt, anger, bitterness, envy, jealousy!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to release yourself from all hurt, deep hurt, anger,
    <br>bitterness, envy, jealousy.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Those who are under the bondage and dominion of the devil - be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Those who are under the bondage and dominion of satan, in whatever way,
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching you -
    <br>touching your life, career, finances, business, family!
    <br>Agree with me - I can feel God's deliverance touching me!
    <br>Confess this!
    <br>I see the Cherubim moving round.
    <br>I see the Cherubim moving round, touching you!

    <br>The day you will sing this song in your dream - oh my God.
    <br>That is the day you will begin to wine and dine with God.
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Don't stop singing this song.
    <br>As you are looking at me, continue meditating in your heart.
    <br>Let it be your prayer. You need to sing it all the time.
    <br>The day you will find yourself, your darling, your son,
    <br>your daughter say, "Mummy, Mummy, you are singing!"
    <br>"I'm singing - which song?"
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken

    <br>Issue of prosperity, issue of this, issue of that - no.
    <br>The relationship contains all this.
    <br>Once you have that relationship, all other things follow.

    <br>Why can't you ask for the whole?
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken

    <br>You are under His eyes.
