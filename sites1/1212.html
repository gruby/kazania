    <br>wherever it is located, I command them out in the name of Jesus.
    <br>In your blood - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your kidney - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your liver - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips right now, viewers all over the world,
    <br>wherever you are, wherever that sickness is located in your body,
    <br>in your blood, kidney, liver, bones - I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Agree with me: I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
