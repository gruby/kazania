  <p>    
    <br>Once again, people of God, this is an opportunity for us to listen to a life experience.
    <br>Let's pay attention to what our brother here has to say.
    <br>My name is Valentine Abazie.
    <br>I am from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I went to Libya in 2015.
    <br>My intention of going there was to cross over from Libya to Europe.
    <br>The journey had been so hectic. When I got there, I did not have enough money to cross over.
    <br>So, I stayed in Libya to work for a while, to raise money for me to cross over the sea.
    <br>When I was in the ghetto, which we call 'camp', I met a lady.
    <br>We met in Libya; we never knew each other's family in Nigeria.
    <br>I had a phone that she would use to call her family in Nigeria.
    <br>We suddenly began a relationship and I promised to marry her
    <br>after we had crossed over to Europe; we would send money to Nigeria to process the marriage.
    <br>OK. We just want to understand clearly what our brother is saying.
    <br>He is explaining that he went to Libya in search of greener pastures, hoping to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe,
    <br>but upon getting to Libya he was struggling, trying to raise enough money to cross over.
    <br>In that process he met a young lady who was also in Libya for the same purpose.
    <br>The two of them befriended themselves and started a relationship.
    <br>In the process, this young lady was using his phone to regularly call her mother here in Nigeria,
    <br>although this young man has never met or known this lady's family.
    <br>They only met themselves whilst they were in Libya, trying to get across the ocean to Italy, to Europe, to start life there.
    <br>So continue from there brother.
    <br>She told her mother that she had found someone she wanted to marry.
    <br>Her mother said it was not a problem but we were still there;
    <br>I had not raised enough money for the crossing.
    <br>They took her to a different location to cross over the sea.
    <br>I told her not to worry as it did not matter if she got there before me.
    <br>After everything, since I had the phone number of her family, I would call her to start life there.
    <br>They took her to another area in Libya near the seaside.
    <br>She didn't have a phone so her parents would call my number.
    <br>I would then call someone who was with her to deliver the message.
    <br>When she was at the seaside, her mother would always call me and ask of her condition.
    <br>I told her that everything was okay.
    <br>When they 'pushed' her into the sea, the boat she was in capsized.
    <br>She was among those who survived and were returned back to Libya.
    <br>She then borrowed a phone from somebody to call me and I went to pick her up.
    <br>By then, I had a place where I was living.
    <br>So, she was on the boat that capsized as they were trying to cross over. In that boat - many people died?
    <br>Some people died but she was among those who survived.
    <br>She called me, told me where she was, so I went and brought her to the house where I was staying.
    <br>So, that was how we started our relationship.
    <br>We agreed to cross over together; she became pregnant for me.
    <br>In the process, after six months, I had saved up enough money.
    <br>We decided it was time for us to cross to Europe.
    <br>So, at this point brother, the lady you met had become pregnant.
    <br>When she returned from the sea and came to my house, that was where she became pregnant.
    <br>We then planned how to cross over to Europe together.
    <br>I never knew any of her family members, although we communicated on the phone.
    <br>When we decided to cross, she was already six months pregnant.
    <br>However, we faced many problems as the Libyan police caught and imprisoned many people.
    <br>Everyone was afraid and we were still in the camp, near the seaside.
    <br>There was such a delay that we were unable to cross.
    <br>By the time it reached September, she was due to deliver the baby.
    <br>In Libya, there is no freedom. Without a passport or travel documents, you cannot move outside.
    <br>When we were in the house, she couldn't go for a medical check-up because of the situation.
    <br>I hope we understand what our brother is saying.
    <br>He said that after he impregnated this particular lady, she was living with him in Libya
    <br>and when she was six months pregnant, they planned together to cross over on the sea to Italy,
    <br>hoping that when they reached there she would deliver her child there,
    <br>and they would start a life as a married couple there.
    <br>However, the weather conditions were very bad at that period and they were unable to go across.
    <br>They were staying in the camp, hoping to cross over the sea to reach Europe.
    <br>They were unable until the point where the lady concerned became eight and a half months pregnant
    <br>and at that time she needed medical attention and care.
    <br>But because they were refugees in Libya, they didn't have valid passports or documents,
    <br>they were unable to have access to medical care
    <br>and at this point she was really having a lot of challenges with her pregnancy
    <br>and was experiencing a lot of pain.
    <br>So continue from that point, brother.
    <br>So, that was how we were waiting for eight months until it reached nine months.
    <br>People were unable to cross to Europe because of the problems at sea and with Libya.
    <br>We were waiting for the sea to settle until it reached the time she was supposed to deliver.
    <br>There was no way she could go out to deliver the baby in a hospital.
    <br>Whilst we were in the camp, some nurses in our midst with experience of childbirth tried to help.
    <br>However, for two days, she was in labour unable to deliver the baby.
    <br>They tried their best until it reached the third day.
    <br>You mean she was in labour for three full days.
    <br>For two days ...
    <br>And this was in this camp without any medical attention.
    <br>No medical attention because we were afraid of going to hospital
    <br>as they could have easily caught us on the way and arrested us.
    <br>They tried their best to make sure she delivered the baby during those two months
    <br>but she could not deliver it.
    <br>When I called the people who used to push us to Europe, they sent a Libyan to take us to hospital.
    <br>By then, she had been in labour for three days.
    <br>We were taken to hospital where scans were taken of her
    <br>and it was discovered that she had high blood pressure, that as her blood pressure was too high,
    <br>she could not deliver the baby except through an operation.
    <br>We were then directed to another hospital, in the same state where they said the same thing.
    <br>We were then transferred to a different hospital in another state.
    <br>They sent someone to pick us up and by that time, she was already weak;
    <br>she could not talk, eat or do anything.
    <br>When we got there in the night, around 2 am, she was taken to the labour room.
    <br>I was waiting outside.
    <br>Nigerian Deportees From Libya Share Their Experience
    <br>I slept outside.
    <br>Then, they came outside and told me that she did not survive the operation.
    <br>She suddenly died; they had already removed the baby through an operation
    <br>and placed it in an incubator, for it to survive.
    <br>So, people of God, I hope we understand what our brother is saying.
    <br>At the time where the lady in question had been labour for up to three days,
    <br>without being able to give birth,
    <br>finally, our brother had to call one of those involved in trafficking people across the sea from Libya to Europe
    <br>and seeing her terrible condition, he actually helped take her to a hospital,
    <br>but upon reaching the hospital and going to various hospitals,
    <br>finally, the lady underwent an operation to remove the pregnancy.
    <br>As the baby was taken out, the lady died.
    <br>And she died moments after the baby had come out.
    <br>And that was the news that our brother heard waiting outside, that the lady he impregnated in Libya,
    <br>who had never known her family, never known her parents - that lady had died
    <br>and the newborn baby was left alone with him.
    <br>Continue from there, brother.
    <br>Some days after I was told that she had died, I called her family in Nigeria to inform them.
    <br>They asked about the baby and I told them that we were still praying to God for it to survive.
    <br>About two days later, when I went home, I bought some drugs and got some money to give them
    <br>so that they could treat him.
    <br>Four days later, I went and took my baby from the hospital to my house.
    <br>There was no way I could take care of the baby there; the mother was even in the mortuary now.
    <br>This lady and I were living in the same house.
    <br>She was helping me to take care of the baby, feeding it baby food.
    <br>So the lady beside you is someone you met in Libya, who is just assisting you to take care,
    <br>to clean the child, because you have no experience with this and the mother of the child is late.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>What happened that you returned to Nigeria?
    <br>I was told that the UN had already given Libya authority to send away all the people
    <br>who were not Libyan citizens back to their county because of their election.
    <br>So, they were raiding all the homes in Libya and I was among them.
    <br>When I took my baby home, they burst through my home and arrested all the people who were there.
    <br>So you were arrested with this little baby in Libya and taken to prison with this little baby.
    <br>Yes. We were arrested in Libya and taken from one prison to another
    <br>until we got to the deportation camp where we were deported.
    <br>I had to take this lady along to help me take care of my baby because when I was in Libya,
    <br>I never knew any members of the girl's family.
    <br>There was no way that I could locate them.
    <br>As refugees, we came together to The SCOAN from Libya.
    <br>Although all the other deportees were attended to, I was asked to wait as my case was different.
    <br>Okay. So what you are saying brother is that from the prison camp you were deported back to Nigeria.
    <br>Upon arriving in Nigeria, you realised that you had no means of reaching the grandparents of this little girl
    <br>because you didn't have their contacts and you decided to come to The SCOAN,
    <br>believing that you would have divine intervention here
    <br>and you explained your case to the evangelist - is that right?
    <br>As you are here right now, when did you arrive back in Nigeria?
    <br>We came back on Tuesday.
    <br>Our brother has just arrived back to the country.
    <br>And just to be very clear brother, the sister that is sitting down here,
    <br>you just met her in Libya. She is just assisting you with this child;
    <br>not that you had any prior relationship with her.
    <br>I don't have any relationship with her. She is just helping me to take care of the baby.
    <br>I met her in Libya.
    <br>She is even supposed to have gone to her state, but she is helping me.
    <br>There is no way I can contact the family of the baby.
    <br>That is why I came to The SCOAN, for them to help me to locate the family of my late wife.
    <br>People of God, we can see on the screen there some clips of when the deportees arrived from Libya,
    <br>coming straight to The SCOAN, with only the clothes on their backs.
    <br>Many of them had been living in Libya for many years, struggling, returning home with nothing.
    <br>And the case of our brother here - he came with this little baby, not knowing the parents or the family members
    <br>of the mother of this child, as the mother died in very traumatic circumstances in Libya.
    <br>The lady that is sitting here is also a deportee from Libya;
    <br>she was just assisting the brother to help with the child.
    <br>Let's hear from our brother. How old is the baby in her hands?
    <br>A month and two weeks.
    <br>- So just a month and two weeks old?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>She was born on 5th September. The baby is nearly two months now.
    <br>So we hear from our brother, that just a month and two weeks old - it is how old this little baby is.
    <br>And even when the baby was born,
    <br>because of the circumstances surrounding the birth, the baby had to be taken to an incubator,
    <br>to various different medical devices to enable it to survive because of the circumstances to which she was born,
    <br>and that's why our brother is here.
    <br>Brother, as you are here in The SCOAN, what is it that you are asking Jesus Christ to do in your situation now?
    <br>I want the man of God to help me because now I am not doing anything.
    <br>I was deported without anything.
    <br>I lost many things and I don't have anything with me to take care of the baby.
    <br>I don't have a job. That is why I am struggling in life and want the man of God to help me survive.
    <br>Okay. People of God, we have listened to the cry of our brother,
    <br>and as it was mentioned here, the large group of deportees arrived from Libya during the week
    <br>and came to The SCOAN.
    <br>We are here to inform the church that Prophet T.B. Joshua's attention was drawn to the case of our brother.
    <br>And by the special grace of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua has located and invited the family members
    <br>of the lady who died in Libya.
    <br>Our brother has never seen them physically before. They too have never seen him before.
    <br>But through the divine intervention of Jesus Christ, Prophet T.B. Joshua, through the Spirit of God
    <br>was able to locate the family members of this little child
    <br>and they are here in our midst right now.
    <br>We want to invite them to come forward.
    <br>Nigerian Deportees From Libya Share Their Experience
    <br>People of God, we understand this is a very emotional moment we are witnessing right now.
    <br>We just want to take the time to listen to the family members, who Prophet T.B. Joshua invited
    <br>because of this brother's case.
    <br>Our mother here - we would like to hear a word from you.
    <br>Could you please introduce yourself to us
    <br>and tell us what can you say concerning the story that has just been narrated?
    <br>Praise Master Jesus!
    <br>My name is Esther Okonkwo.
    <br>I am a businesswoman living in Benin.
    <br>One day, my daughter called me and told me that she wanted to travel abroad by land.
    <br>I said, "No", that she should wait.
    <br>The next thing I heard was that she had already reached Libya.
    <br>She asked me to send her money, that she wanted to cross over.
    <br>I then sent some money to her.
    <br>She said she wanted to cross. I don't know how she left.
    <br>Within a short while, she called me and told me that she had met a men she wanted to marry.
    <br>She didn't tell me that she was pregnant.
    <br>Nigerian Deportees From Libya Share Their Experience
    <br>I am a market trader and one day, as I was offloading my goods,
    <br>I received a call that her labour had started. I asked what kind of labour.
    <br>I left the driver with the load, ran inside my house and prayed.
    <br>I took her picture to my altar and prayed.
    <br>On Tuesday afternoon, I received a call asking me if I was at home.
    <br>I said no, that I was in the market. It was my younger brother; he told me to go to my house.
    <br>When I got to my house and heard the news that my daughter had died, I nearly ran mad.
    <br>She was my first daughter - 27 years old.
    <br>I didn't know I would get through to them; I didn't even know the husband.
    <br>I only communicated with him through Facebook
    <br>but today, I am seeing him face to face for the first time.
    <br>You mean to say, madam, that the young brother standing here  and the other lady - you have never seen them before?
    <br>No.
    <br>It is my first time of seeing him like this.
    <br>When the incident happened, for four days we didn't hear anything from them.
    <br>Nigerian Deportees From Libya Share Their Experience
    <br>I began to pray.
    <br>After four days, I was sent a picture of this baby.
    <br>I began using the picture to pray with, day and night.
    <br>I was so surprised on Thursday when I received a phone call from The SCOAN.
    <br>They asked me if I knew Valentine. I replied that I didn't know him face to face,
    <br>but that we would always communicate through Facebook.
    <br>I asked him to explain. He said that he had impregnated my daughter
    <br>and that in the process of delivery, my daughter died.
    <br>I asked the person about my grandchild's whereabouts.
    <br>The person who brought me the news told me to calm down.
    <br>So that was how Prophet T.B. Joshua invited you here to The SCOAN.
    <br>I was informed that T.B. Joshua was inviting me to The SCOAN.
    <br>Once again, people of God, we just want to fully understand what our mother is saying.
    <br>She is explaining how she had actually warned her daughter not to travel abroad,
    <br>that she should be patient and wait for the right time.
    <br>But one day, upon coming home from market, she realised that her daughter had left,
    <br>and she later learned that she was in Libya.
    <br>Through their conversation,
    <br>she found out that she had tried to cross over the sea to Europe on several occasions unsuccessfully.
    <br>Even one time when the boat capsized, many people died and she was one of sole survivors.
    <br>And she later learned that she had befriended a gentleman in Libya and at that point she had become pregnant.
    <br>And also our mother learned one day that as she was in labour,
    <br>her daughter had actually died and that she had given birth to a child,
    <br>before she finally passed away.
    <br>It was only after this brother and several others were deported from Libya and returned to Nigeria,
    <br>that a phone call was given to our mother from Prophet T.B. Joshua, The SCOAN, inviting her to be here.
    <br>And it is here, in the church,
    <br>that she is seeing the gentleman that her daughter had a relationship with and wanted to marry,
    <br>and the father of this child.
    <br>She is seeing him for the very first time, and she is seeing the child of her late daughter for the very first time.
    <br>Mama, what can you say about what God has done for you to be holding this child in your hands right now?
    <br>I am thanking God.
    <br>When they called me concerning this child, that it was at The SCOAN, I said, "God, I thank You!"
    <br>I knew that the baby was in the hands of God.
    <br>Today, you are happy to know that you have seen the gentleman concerned
    <br>and you are reconciled with this beautiful baby boy, through the intervention of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Madam, who is the young lady standing beside you?
    <br>Okonkwo Chinonso.
    <br>Who is she to you?
    <br>She is my younger daughter.
    <br>Okay, so she is your daughter and the sister of the lady that passed away in Libya.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let's just hear a quick word from our sister as well.
    <br>Sister, you are welcome. Please introduce yourself to us and just tell us what can you also say concerning
    <br>the life experience that has just been narrated here.
    <br>Good morning everybody.
    <br>My name is Okonkwo Chinonso.
    <br>My sister told me that she wanted to travel.
    <br>I told her that she should not travel and wait.
    <br>Then, I heard that she had left already.
    <br>When she arrived in Libya, she contacted my mom, and my mom told me that my sister went to Libya.
    <br>I was wondering why she did not listen to us.
    <br>She was there for over a year.
    <br>She wanted to cross, but she was not able to do that.
    <br>My mom told her that if she couldn't cross, she should come home.
    <br>Maybe it was because of the pregnancy that she refused to come home.
    <br>Later we heard that she was in labour.
    <br>After that, she died.
    <br>So what can you say concerning what God has done for you and your family
    <br>by reconciling you with this baby boy here in The SCOAN?
    <br>I am so happy to see my late sister's son.
    <br>It was not easy for a child to be born in Libya and come to Nigeria alive.
    <br>I thank God for what He has done for us.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Finally, we want to just hear a word of advice from our mother.
    <br>Mama, based on what has happened to your daughter and this life experience,
    <br>what is your advice to our viewers?
    <br>If any of your children say they want to cross over to Libya, do not give your consent.
    <br>I advise people not to travel abroad by land.
    <br>We have listened to the experience of this family.
    <br>Our brother explained how he met the sister who is late today.
    <br>And as you have heard, mama said she was seeing this brother for the first time.
    <br>They came here today because she heard that her daughter died and they did not know how to get the child,
    <br>because they were told that the government had taken the child and was with somebody they didn't know.
    <br>But this brother came among those who were deported last week.
    <br>He came with the baby and the sister sitting over there.
    <br>After listening to everyone,
    <br>The SCOAN realised that this case needed to be looked into. It was more than an issue of giving money.
    <br>After helping each and every one of them, listening to their issues,
    <br>the man of God established them on how to move on and start with their lives.
    <br>In this case, the man of God decided that this issue needed to be considered properly
    <br>and the church must look for the family concerned.
    <br>Since this brother claimed that he had never met with the mother of his late wife,
    <br>the church took upon themselves to look for the mother, who is here in our midst today with the younger sister,
    <br>so that they can be reconciled. The child would now be taken from the father to late mom's mother,
    <br>so that she would be able to take care of this child.
    <br>That is why you see what is happening right here.
    <br>You can see on the screen of your television the picture of the sister who gave birth to the child.
    <br>When I was in Libya, we were living in the same house.
    <br>When I brought the baby to the house to live with me, there was no one else who could help me take care of the baby.
    <br>She is the one who has been helping me to take care of and feed the baby.
    <br>Can we quickly listen to her?
    <br>Tell us your name and your own condition at the moment.
    <br>My name is Cherish.
    <br>I went to Libya in July and I am pregnant.
    <br>- You are pregnant?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- So, you also went to Libya, right?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Where is the father of your expected baby?
    <br>He went back to Italy.
    <br>We understand that for the past one month you have been taking care of this child.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you explain to us a little bit about your role?
    <br>I was a mother for him.
    <br>When they brought the child from hospital, they gave me the child to take care of him.
    <br>The baby is just two months old.
    <br>- The baby is just two months old?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Have you ever seen this woman sitting down before?
    <br>- No.
    <br>Tell us how old are you
    <br>and explain, for the benefit of the young ones listening to you, why did you make this journey to Libya.
    <br>I am twenty five years old.
    <br>I graduated in July from Delta State University - Science Department.
    <br>My brother and my family's relatives are over there.
    <br>After I finished my project at school, my brother decided to take six girls and three boys to Italy.
    <br>That day I came back from school and my mum called.
    <br>When my mum finished her conversation with my brother,
    <br>I told my mum that I would follow the people who were going.
    <br>My mum asked if I was sure that I wanted to make this journey and I said, 'Yes'.
    <br>She said 'Okay' and she prayed for me. Then she phoned my dad.
    <br>My dad said, 'No problem' and that the grace was with me.
    <br>Where is your mother and father?
    <br>My mum is in Edo State.
    <br>- You are also from Edo State?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>And your dad?
    <br>My dad is in Edo State but I am not from Edo State, I live in Edo State.
    <br>You mean that after you graduated from Science Department at the University of Delta,
    <br>you made a journey to Libya?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I believe the journey was rough. Can you describe it?
    <br>In the first place, why did you decide to go to Libya after graduating?
    <br>After my graduation in July this year, when I submitted my project on Friday in school, I came back home on Saturday.
    <br>Then, on Monday I started the journey.
    <br>The road was not easy, it was very difficult.
    <br>It is not the way we hear about it.
    <br>The people who went there will confirm it was not easy.
    <br>From Libya to Italy the journey was by sea, and they made people cross over in boats.
    <br>Many died.
    <br>When the war started, we were at the ghetto.
    <br>They came with bombs. I even said my last prayer that God should accept my soul.
    <br>I was thinking that night that everybody there would die, but God came to our rescue.
    <br>We saw dead bodies on the floor.
    <br>A lot of people died, including babies and mothers.
    <br>And you were among those that were also taken to prison in Libya?
    <br>Yes, I was among those that were taken to prison.
    <br>Once again, people of God, we are learning a life lesson from the confessions we are listening to right now.
    <br>Our sister is explaining the terrible conditions that she experienced and underwent
    <br>when she travelled in an illegal way to Libya.
    <br>And as a result of that, she is advising people of God and all those listening to her that they should never,
    <br>under any circumstances, attempt to take such a journey.
    <br>Because as she is here right now, she is pregnant and the father of her child is not with her - he has travelled abroad.
    <br>Even though she has graduated, she is not in a condition right now to be able to use her certificate in the right way.
    <br>Once again, we are asking these question so the people of God can learn
    <br>and the youth especially who are watching this program
    <br>live on Emmanuel TV will be cautioned against ever considering such a journey.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua often says, "It is not where you are, but who you are that matters".
    <br>And indeed, our youth should know that we should not be too hasty in an attempt to travel abroad at all costs.
    <br>We must be patient and wait for God's appointed time.
    <br>Because if it's God's time for us to travel, we will travel in a right and legal way,
    <br>and in a way that will glorify His holy name.
    <br>Once again, people of God, let's make sure we learn lessons from the experiences in life
    <br>that we are hearing right now.
    <br>- So, you travelled just a few months ago?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>We are saying this because I think you did not know the grace God has given you.
    <br>You are such a beautiful lady.
    <br>And I believe that when you went to the university to study for four, five years,
    <br>you never planned to end this way.
    <br>No.
    <br>Madam, I believe that if you knew how this story would end, you would not allow your child to travel.
    <br>I did not agree to her travelling. I told her to wait.
    <br>Now, with what has happened to you, what advice do you want to give to parents?
    <br>Pray. When you talk to a child, pray that the child will listen to you.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.
