    <br>Emmanuel TV Choir Christmas Carols
    <br>From The Manger Square In Bethlehem
    <br>I believe
    <br>Help my unbelief
    <br>Lord I believe
    <br>Help me overcome my unbelief
    <br>Believing is the only condition
    <br>For answered prayer
    <br>With my mouth I confess
    <br>And with my heart I believe
    <br>I believe God's Word
    <br>Is true for my life
    <br>Lord I believe
    <br>Help me overcome my unbelief
    <br>Don't let the devil
    <br>Get you out of faith
    <br>If you believe and do not doubt
    <br>Your faith takes over
    <br>Believing in Christ
    <br>That is my connection
    <br>I don't say amen
    <br>Because everyone says amen
    <br>But I say amen
    <br>Because I believe
    <br>Lord I believe
    <br>Help me overcome my unbelief
    <br>Believe is the only condition
    <br>Help my unbelief
    <br>Believe is the only condition
    <br>Help my unbelief
    <br>Believe is the only condition
    <br>Help my unbelief
