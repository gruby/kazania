  <p>    
    <br>My brother, you listened to the message today?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What are you taking home?
    <br>I'm taking home the fact that I must deny myself, carry my cross and follow Jesus.
    <br>But before now, you were born again?
    <br>Yes, Man of God. Ok!
    <br>Ok. But now, you have not denied yourself, have you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You want to go and deny yourself now?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>How do you deny yourself?
    <br>By giving total commitment to God, and not just lip service.
    <br>There is an injection you were taking before, that used to make you high.
    <br>I am happy you have realised that you need to deny yourself and take up your cross.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Not just accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.
    <br>If you say you accept Jesus genuinely, commitment would ask Jesus to accept you, to take you.
    <br>The commitment is the one that will introduce you, not the acceptance.
    <br>When you say, "I accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour" truly, genuinely,
    <br>but the commitment would now be the one to introduce you, "Jesus, ok, this is a beloved one".
    <br>Your healing - because you want to live for God.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Ok? That is why they cannot ask you, "Where is the money?
    <br>Bring money, food, bring this, bring that!" - no!
    <br>Because to live for God - that is why you are receiving this healing.
    <br>Come on!

    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I can walk now.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Emmanuel, People of God!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Derek Miranda, I'm a Zimbabwean that's currently residing in Kenya.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is that of difficulty in walking caused by a broken femur.
    <br>I sustained a broken femur earlier this year from an accident that occurred whilst I was running.
    <br>As a result of that accident, I was impaired; I spent a month out of work.
    <br>And the pain that followed was unbearable.
    <br>It stopped me from enjoying the simple things in life.
    <br>I could not move with freedom. I could not sit or stand for too long.
    <br>My entire existence reminded me of the fact that I had a broken leg and I was in pain.
    <br>So, it affected my work and I was highly dependent on drugs to help me cope with the pain.
    <br>That is what brought me to The SCOAN in pursuit of a solution.
    <br>So as a result of my injury, I had to use crutches to help me with my mobility if I wanted to go places.
    <br>I couldn't lift my leg, I had to drag it along; it had lost muscle strength and power.
    <br>So, I had seen multiple orthopedic surgeons in different countries such as Kenya and South Africa.
    <br>But the last orthopedic surgeon that we consulted indicated that I needed to go back into surgery.
    <br>Once I returned to my original orthopedic surgeon, he advised me that he saw nothing wrong.
    <br>So, it was a conflict in medical opinion over my situation.
    <br>Therefore, I decided that I was going to consult and seek the Word of God over my life and situation.
    <br>And that is what brought me here to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I came here, by the grace of God, the man of God located me.
    <br>When he located me, he came towards me and he started ministering towards me.
    <br>He told me that it is not the acceptance of Jesus Christ that brings Him to the scene.
    <br>It is your total commitment to Him that brings Him to the scene.
    <br>And once he did that, he also prophesied upon my life and
    <br>he indicated the fact that I had been using drugs that made me high.
    <br>I confirm this prophecy to be true at this point because I've been highly dependent on codeine
    <br>as a substance to help me cope with pain.
    <br>As soon as the man of God was done ministering to me - I donÂ´t even think he touched me,
    <br>he just stretched his hand towards me and instantly, I felt an unspeakable surge of power
    <br>go through my entire body, go through my entire being
    <br>and I do not remember what happened.
    <br>All I know is that I felt that power.
    <br>When I stood up, it was as if something had left me and I was finding myself again.
    <br>That's what happened.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!

    <br>So, you mean, you felt that overwhelming power - the presence of God?
    <br>And when you stood up, what happened?
    <br>When I stood up, I stood up with  a renewed sense of energy.
    <br>My bones felt really strengthened to a point where I could stand on one leg which I could never do before.
    <br>Just for dressing up, I had to sit on the bed.
    <br>But now, I can actually stand on the leg that was previously injured.
    <br>So I felt a large sense of renewal within my entire being.
    <br>So, you mean now that all the things you could not do before, you can now do them?
    <br>And the pain is now a thing of the past?
    <br>Yes, pain is now a thing of the past, in Jesus' mighty name!
    <br>Amen! Put your hands together for Jesus!

    <br>Yes. To the glory of God, can you now move and let us see what the Lord has done in your life?

    <br>Can you still feel the pain as you're moving?
    <br>There is no pain whatsoever.
    <br>To God be the glory.

    <br>And remember, in your testimony, you said you were addicted to codeine because of this terrible pain.
    <br>So now, are you still addicted to drugs now? Are you still having that issue?
    <br>No, I have no desire to take drugs.
    <br>The enemy tried to tempt me with a headache but I couldn't even take painkillers to treat that headache.
    <br>So, I have no affinity or desire towards taking any drugs. I am pain-free and drug-free.
    <br>Wow.

    <br>The advice that I have for them is the same advice that the Prophet gave last week:
    <br>That it is not just acceptance of Christ Jesus; it is your total commitment to Jesus Christ.
    <br>Denying yourself is what compels Jesus to approach and come on the scene.
    <br>So, be committed to God, like the man of God said. It is not only accepting Him
    <br>as your Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, but be totally committed to Him with your body, spirit and soul
    <br>and it shall be well with you in Jesus' name.
