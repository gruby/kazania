  <p>    
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>We are here to declare we love Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for accepting us.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>WE ARE ONE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>To really show that we love Him, you must have one purpose -
    <br>salvation of our soul.
    <br>The Bible says:
    <br>The work of the Holy Spirit first begins in the understanding and is carried on
    <br>to the will, affections and conversation.
    <br>This means, to be born again is to give up to God.
    <br>The title of the message:
    <br>WE ARE ONE
    <br>1 Corinthians 12:14:
    <br>"Now the body is not made up of one part but of many."
    <br>This means, the numbers - many but the body is one.
    <br>All Christians make up one body in Christ.
    <br>Jesus is the Head of the body.
    <br>The common centre of their unity.
    <br>If Jesus is the common centre of their unity,
    <br>this means they are one body but with one purpose in life.
    <br>It is like carrying different stones, yam, cassava, sand, this, that.
    <br>That is a load inside of a basket,
    <br>but this is the body that carries it.
    <br>No matter what is inside the basket - the body that carries it is this.
    <br>It is the same body that will feel the weight.
    <br>No matter what is inside the basket.
    <br>No matter what is inside this; whether biscuits, stones - who carries it?
    <br>The numbers - many but the body - one.
    <br>What is that verse 14 trying to say?
    <br>Each of us have different ministries,
    <br>different challenges,
    <br>different operations and different gifts
    <br>but we are still on one body.
    <br>If T.B. Joshua does not recognize you, that are endowed with different gifts,
    <br>I am working for Jesus, but I am not a friend of Jesus.
    <br>Many are working for Jesus.
    <br>How many are friends of Jesus?
    <br>If you do not recognise me because I am given a different ministry,
    <br>different operation, different gift,
    <br>you are working for Jesus but not a friend of Jesus.
    <br>Because the Bible says, every member, mystically, cannot have the same office.
    <br>Let someone say, "Mystically cannot have the same place."
    <br>Each member has its particular form,
    <br>use, operation and place.
    <br>God has placed us where it pleases Him.
    <br>Are you where God wants you to be?
    <br>He is not fixed in the same station, the same place
    <br>or favoured with the same gift.
    <br>Shall we say, he does not belong to Christ?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you where God wants you to be?"
    <br>If you are where God wants you to be, His grace will be sufficient for you.
    <br>If you are where God wants you to be, He will always speak strength
    <br>and courage through your trials.
    <br>Many of us are not where God wants us to be.
    <br>That is why when trouble comes, we abandon our post,
    <br>we go out of our way.
    <br>And that trouble is supposed to be a tonic to our anointing,
    <br>if you are where God wants you to be.
    <br>Because the Bible says in the Book of Mark 12:10:
    <br>"The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.
    <br>It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes."
    <br>The Bible says man's rejection provokes God's direction.
    <br>When man rejects you, God will direct you.
    <br>When you were rejected, did you experience God's direction?
    <br>If truly you are a child of God, that persecution is the Lord's doing,
    <br>so that He can use it to bring the best out of you.
    <br>That hatred of men - people hate you - it is the Lord's doing, God allowed it to happen,
    <br>so that He can bring the best out of you.
    <br>If you are where God wants you to be, your struggle will make you stronger.
    <br>1 Corinthians 12:22:
    <br>"On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
    <br>and the parts that we think are less honourable we treat..."
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>Imagine: if everyone loved me and accepted me,
    <br>I would grow up being a weakling.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by 'weakling'?
    <br>That is depending on the people to show me the way.
    <br>When you make God all and all, you will have direction.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Man's rejection, provokes God's direction."
    <br>The question: Are you where God wants you to be?
    <br>If you are not where God wants you to be, you will always go out of your way.
    <br>When you are where God wants you to be,
    <br>where God guides, where God be - protection be.
    <br>If you are not where God wants you to be,
    <br>you will always depend on what you see, what you hear and what others tell you.
    <br>Remember, we walk by faith, not by sight.
    <br>The problem most of us are facing; we have been renovated externally.
    <br>But the Bible is talking about internal renovation and drinking into one Spirit.
    <br>Not external renovation - internal renovation.
    <br>Until you are renovated on the inside, you will not be able to maintain your union with Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Until you are renovated on the inside,
    <br>you cannot maintain your union with Christ."
    <br>What do I mean by 'union with Christ'?
    <br>Union with Christ is our walking with Him.
    <br>Good times, hard times.
    <br>When you are renovated on the inside, you will see your hard times
    <br>as an opportunity for you to honour God before men.
    <br>Look at Daniel,
    <br>Meshach, Shadrach, Abednego,
    <br>Joseph, Moses.
    <br>Do you see your encounter with hard times as an opportunity for you to honour God,
    <br>or do you see it as an opportunity to run helter-skelter?
    <br>You are looking for blessing, money, you are so desperate.
    <br>When you are desperate to get blessing, you will not mind the source of your blessing.
    <br>When satan came to Jesus and asked Him,
    <br>"You are hungry. Here is the food",
    <br>Jesus said, "Look, it is true I am hungry, but I am not desperate at all."
    <br>When you know that you are a part of the body; remember, we have one purpose in life.
    <br>Satan always uses our situation - he knows your situation.
    <br>Immediately he realises that this man is sick,
    <br>he will begin to move around, using that situation to tempt you.
    <br>Many of us have gone out of our way, our duty, forfeited God's promise.
    <br>Pride is the major problem we are facing.
    <br>Pride does not allow us to acknowledge another's gifts.
    <br>Anything you do not have is not from God  - that is pride.
    <br>No one can succeed alone.
    <br>The minutest member is a part of the body - tell your neighbour.
    <br>All His members, He honours dearly.
    <br>Pride is a sin in us by nature
    <br>and we must be armed against it
    <br>because all believers make up one body in Christ.
    <br>Because the Bible says, God has placed us where it pleases Him.
    <br>Are you where God placed you?
    <br>If you are not there, you will go out of your way, your duty.
    <br>Blessed is the man who follows the path of God.
    <br>Even in darkness, light shines for the upright.
    <br>Everyone has dark moments.
    <br>What is your dark moment?
    <br>Your dark moment could be poverty, isolation, rejection, name calling, false accusation,
    <br>nightmare, fear.
    <br>If truly you are a child of God, God will speak strength and courage through your darkness.
    <br>If your enemy uses iron to block your way,
    <br>God will call a welder to cut the iron.
    <br>WE ARE ONE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>In every situation, God has something to say.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[In every situation, God has something to say.]
    <br>In every situation, God has something to say.
    <br>Even when He seems to be silent, He is still saying something.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You obstacle, I will not because of you change my direction.
    <br>God can still speak through you."
    <br>When the Lord said to Moses, "Stop disturbing Me. I have heard you."
    <br>"You say You have heard me, but this is the Red Sea. Make a road and let me walk."
    <br>The Lord said, "Have faith and see whether you will not walk."
    <br>This means faith does not ask for possible things but impossible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Faith does not ask for possible things but impossible.]
    <br>This is what you are here for.
    <br>You are here for what you cannot do yourself.
    <br>When the Lord asked Moses, "Go! Act faith and move" -
    <br>in the natural it was not possible for one to walk on the sea,
    <br>but the Lord said, "Go!"
    <br>That shows he should go by faith.
    <br>I want to tell you today, with God, all things are possible.
    <br>Rise up and wave your hand and believe this, that with God, all things are possible.
    <br>I am here for what I cannot do myself.
    <br>Wave your hand.
    <br>Open your lips now.
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you...
    <br>Satan has a chain of doubt.
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>begin to disconnect yourself.
    <br>WE ARE ONE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The word 'connected' - when you say, "whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself',
    <br>it is like you give somebody something, and there is still a rope connected to it.
    <br>We call it, 'blessing of the world'.
    <br>Blessing of the world is a fading thing, like a photocopy.
    <br>If you give me this book, I will take it to the machine, I will do a copy.
    <br>We, we have an original blessing - satan has a photocopy.
    <br>And that photocopy he keeps giving to his people.
    <br>If I have a photocopy here, make another photocopy and give you back...
    <br>Before you do copies out of that photocopy, the whole thing will fade away.
    <br>You will not be able to read the letters again.
    <br>That is satan for you.
    <br>Blessing of the world is a fading thing - tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Blessing of the world is a fading thing.]
    <br>As the blessing is fading away, so the life that carries it.
