    <br>This is another one of the centres in Africa
    <br>where THE NEW ANOINTING WATER has been taken to.
    <br>Let us watch what happened
    <br>when they merely touched the container
    <br>without even opening the bottle of the New Anointing Water to minister it.
    <br>Stay blessed.
    <br>They Only Touched The PACKAGE Of NEW ANOINTING WATER!!!
    <br>All poisonous substances - out!
