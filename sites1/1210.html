    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Juanita McCarby. The man standing beside me is my lovely husband, Victor McCarby.
    <br>This is our son, Prince McCarby, and the gorgeous lady at the end is a very good friend, Demi.
    <br>We came from the USA.
    <br>I am so happy to be here to give this testimony.
    <br>It all started so many years ago.
    <br>I got pregnant and I carried this pregnancy for nine months.
    <br>Six days to delivery, I had this cold sensation all over me.
    <br>A cold wind blew from my head to my knees and after that experience, I noticed that my stomach became stiff.
    <br>And immediately I noticed that the baby had stopped kicking in my womb.
    <br>After some time, we went to the doctor and we were told that the baby was dead in the womb,
    <br>and miraculously the baby came out.
    <br>After two years, by the grace of God, I got pregnant again.
    <br>I carried this pregnancy for nine months.
    <br>Five days to delivery, the same thing happened - I had this cold wind all over me.
    <br>We called the midwife immediately.
    <br>We got to the hospital and we were told that the baby was dead in the womb for a second time.
    <br>This baby also came out miraculously.
    <br>It was after the second experience that we realised that this was not normal.
    <br>So, we started going to churches.
    <br>My husband was living in the US then and I was living in Ghana.
    <br>I attended every church in Ghana.
    <br>I went through so many deliverances.
    <br>I sowed a lot of seeds in the form of money.
    <br>Huge sums of money were taken from me and I was assured that everything was going to be normal.
    <br>We also went to the hospital and we were declared fit to have a baby.
    <br>After three years I got pregnant again.
    <br>I carried this pregnancy for nine months.
    <br>Four days to delivery, I had the same experience again - I had this cold wind all over me.
    <br>And after that experience, I noticed that the baby died again in my womb.
    <br>This time, because of the deliverances I went through, I told myself that I was not going to go to the hospital.
    <br>So, for three weeks I did not go to the hospital.
    <br>I didn't realise that I was doing something horrible to myself.
    <br>At that moment, the baby rotted in my womb and I experienced a lot of pain all over my body.
    <br>My friend here, Demi, took me to the hospital
    <br>and when we got there the doctor examined me and noticed that the baby was dead,
    <br>rotten and some parts of the body had disengaged in the womb.
    <br>A surgery was therefore necessary.
    <br>The doctor told us that there was a 50% chance of survival
    <br>because when the baby is removed, there is a chance that not everything will be removed from the womb.
    <br>This could result in either a part of the womb or the whole womb being removed.
    <br>I was so worried because I was a young woman who had just gotten married.
    <br>We wanted to have our own baby, but there was a possibility that my womb would be removed.
    <br>We did not know what to do.
    <br>That was when the doctor left us, because he was not ready to do the surgery.
    <br>He said that whenever he was about to do a surgery,
    <br>he would have a feeling and this meant that the person was going to die.
    <br>So, that is why the doctor left us at the hospital.
    <br>During this third pregnancy, two weeks to term, we came across Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I have been to so many churches for deliverance.
    <br>I have drank many bottles of anointing oil
    <br>and I have paid a lot of money as I was told that I needed to 'sow emergency seed'
    <br>of 500 Ghana Cedi, 1 000 Ghana Cedi, 2 000 Ghana Cedi .
    <br>Because we wanted to have a baby, I would call my husband and ask him to send the money.
    <br>At the hospital, while I was lying on the bed after they had prepared me for the surgery,
    <br>I remembered that we had a recorded prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua on my phone.
    <br>I called my friend and she sneaked in and brought the phone to me.
    <br>I placed the phone to my ear on the pillow and I started listening to the prayer.
    <br>During the prayer the man of God said, "You are released!" and I also said, "I am released!". I kept on praying.
    <br>I saw a hand press on my stomach and immediately the dead, rotten baby was flushed out of my womb.
    <br>THE DEAD BABY WHO CAME BACK TO LIFE!!!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>When the baby came out, I was given the highest form of medication - antibiotics.
    <br>They thought that I would get a negative reaction to the medication,
    <br>but they examined me the following morning and noticed that everything was okay.
    <br>THE DEAD BABY WHO CAME BACK TO LIFE!!!
    <br>I was discharged from the hospital and I went back home.
    <br>At that time, my husband was trying to get me to the US and we were experiencing difficulties.
    <br>We did not know what was wrong; they just refused to attend to us.
    <br>But immediately once the baby came out after the prayer on my phone of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>my visa was approved.
    <br>THE DEAD BABY WHO CAME BACK TO LIFE!!!
    <br>I had my permanent resident visa and came to The SCOAN to give my testimony.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, gave me prophecy and I left for the US in 2016.
    <br>When I got there, by the special grace of God, I got pregnant again.
    <br>I carried the baby up to 35 weeks, with one week to go to delivery.
    <br>During the 35th week, my husband called me from work and told me that he had heard a voice in his heart
    <br>which said that he should go to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>He bought his ticket, called our friends in Ghana and they also came with him to The SCOAN.
    <br>I stayed alone in the USA, waiting for his return.
    <br>On the Friday morning, he called me and told me that they were going to the Prayer Mountain.
    <br>By then I had already gotten up in my room and when I came out, I again felt that cold wind at the gate.
    <br>Immediately my stomach became stiff and the baby stopped kicking once again.
    <br>But this time, my husband told me that they were going to the Prayer Mountain
    <br>and that I should keep calm as he was going there to pray for me.
    <br>So, I kept calm.
    <br>I stayed in the house, praying and crying, asking God, "What is this again?"
    <br>After six hours, I heard a voice in my heart telling me to go and sleep.
    <br>People of God, in that condition, no woman can fall asleep, but within ten minutes I fell asleep.
    <br>I had switched on Emmanuel TV in my bedroom while sleeping in my bed.
    <br>I saw lightning go through our gate. It came back to my bed with vibrations and it made such a loud noise.
    <br>The bed and my stomach were vibrating.
    <br>THE DEAD BABY WHO CAME BACK TO LIFE!!!
    <br>I shouted, "Jesus!", because I didn't know what was happening to me.
    <br>When that all stopped, I immediately felt the baby kicking again after six hours.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus.
    <br>The following week my husband returned to the USA and I went into labour.
    <br>In fact, I did not even feel the labour pains because for the first time I had a live baby kicking while I was in labour.
    <br>We prayed and by the special grace of God, baby Prince was born. All glory be to God.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ. Come on, we can do better than that.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Madam, what can you say concerning what actually took place?
    <br>There is power in this church. There is power in the prayers of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When he is praying for the viewers, whether you are listening or you are watching, there is power.
    <br>Let me encourage those watching me right now.
    <br>You may be going through this problem or something else.
    <br>Always believe that Jesus is alive.
    <br>If you put your hope and trust in Him, He will answer you
    <br>and you will rejoice with me as I am rejoicing today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Hallelujah. Clap for Jesus.
    <br>I was told at the hospital that if I did not feel the movement of the baby for just one hour, I should call them.
    <br>But, when I called my husband, he said that they were going to Prayer Mountain and I should not call anybody.
    <br>So, that is why I didn't call the hospital.
    <br>But, along the line, I got scared because if I didn't call and something happened,
    <br>they would remove the baby and arrest me, and say that I was the one who killed the baby intentionally.
    <br>I was scared, but I also believed in what my husband told me that they were going to the Prayer Mountain
    <br>and that he was going to pray for me, so I should not worry. I shouldn't call anybody.
    <br>I should wait for him to come back from the Prayer Mountain.
    <br>The moment that he came back from the Prayer Mountain, the baby started kicking again.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Victor McCarby.
    <br>The woman next to me is my wife.
    <br>And this is our dear friend who helped when we needed help.
    <br>You have heard it from my wife; she has said it all.
    <br>But you can imagine, being married for 11 years without the cry of a baby in the house,
    <br>what family members and friends would say.
    <br>We can see that the gentleman is crying tears of joy after 11 years of not being able to have a child.
    <br>Remember, they have gone through a lot as a couple.
    <br>Not only once, not twice, not three times, but four times the baby died in the womb.
    <br>But, through the grace of Jesus Christ, through Emmanuel TV, God Almighty restored this child in her womb
    <br>and he is here today to share that wonderful testimony, to the glory of God.
    <br>People said so many things, but I was still trusting in God.
    <br>I knew that God would come through for us.
    <br>Along the line, we came across Emmanuel TV.
    <br>My wife saw Emmanuel TV first and introduced me to it.
    <br>When I began to watch it, I realised that something different was happening in the world.
    <br>I had not seen this anywhere else.
    <br>I said, "This is where we can get deliverance".
    <br>While my wife was going through all these things, I was in the US and she was in Ghana.
    <br>I cried all the time because I was not with her to support her.
    <br>With the last pregnancy, our beautiful baby here, something told me to come to The SCOAN,
    <br>and I knew that this was where we would get the solution.
    <br>When she told me that once again she was not feeling the baby kicking,
    <br>I said that the baby would not die if I was in the arena of liberty.
    <br>I told her not to call the hospital and she must not tell anybody what was happening.
    <br>THE DEAD BABY WHO CAME BACK TO LIFE!!!
    <br>I told her not to call the hospital or tell anybody anything.
    <br>And I thank God that she listened to me, because many women would have done something different.
    <br>So, she listened to my instructions
    <br>and when I went to the Prayer Mountain, I took a photo of her where she was pregnant and placed it on the floor.
    <br>I cried to God saying, "Please don't let this happen again. This is the arena of liberty. Let me also be liberated".
    <br>When I returned from the Prayer Mountain, she called me and said that the baby was kicking.
    <br>I was so surprised and happy.
    <br>I realised that the baby started kicking again when I was at the Prayer Mountain.
    <br>I just want to say that there is power in this place.
    <br>Indeed, there is power in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>It is that power that brought about this miracle child today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We went to so many places but there was no solution.
    <br>If the solution came from here, what else? It is done. That is all.
    <br>This is the arena of liberty, the arena of freedom.
    <br>THE DEAD BABY WHO CAME BACK TO LIFE!!!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Demi Nustugah.
    <br>Beside me is my friend, who I call my sister now, Juanita McCarby and her husband, Victor McCarby.
    <br>And this is our little miracle, Prince McCarby.
    <br>My sister has said it all.
    <br>I came into her life during her third pregnancy.
    <br>On 25th April 2015 she went for the last antenatal examination and she received the same report again.
    <br>She said that she was tired of going to different places for solution,
    <br>so we stayed and prayed, hoping that things would turn around.
    <br>On 23rd May she went into labour and I rushed her to the hospital.
    <br>The doctor examined her at the hospital and when he saw her condition,
    <br>he instructed one of the nurses to call the Police and inform them, just in case something happened to her.
    <br>He said that they would hold me and another family friend who took her to the hospital, responsible.
    <br>They informed the Police to be aware. In case something happened to her, we would be responsible.
    <br>I was marching in front of the Labour Ward, praying and crying unto God to deliver us from this problem.
    <br>Juanita then asked one of the nurses in the delivery room with her to fetch her phone from me.
    <br>We recorded Prophet T.B. Joshua's prayers on our phones, so that we could pray along with him at any time.
    <br>So I sneaked the phone into her.
    <br>And I heard one of the nurses say, "You are here between life and death, and all you are thinking about is a phone".
    <br>But, we knew what she was going to do with her phone.
    <br>She turned on Prophet T.B. Joshua's prayer which was, "Be released!".
    <br>So, she had her phone to her ear and covered it with her head.
    <br>I was still praying in front of her door.
    <br>The next moment, I heard another nurse start screaming, "Hallelujah! The baby has come out!".
    <br>Now, the situation was more serious because the baby was not only dead, it was breached.
    <br>That meant that the only option was to do an operation.
    <br>For a breached, dead baby to come out on its own, only God could do it.
    <br>The nurse was shocked because five minutes later the placenta and everything else also came out.
    <br>I just thanked God outside.
    <br>They now prescribed the highest form of medication for her due to the dead, rotten baby causing infection inside of her.
    <br>They then also ran blood tests, and I brought the results with me in the morning.
    <br>The Head of the Gynaecology Department of the hospital came with his students to examine her,
    <br>and she became their case study.
    <br>He asked his students, "If a woman is with a child and the child is dead, what are the complications?".
    <br>The students responded giving all the technical terms, which I did not understand.
    <br>He then asked for the laboratory results.
    <br>When he looked at them, he asked, "Are you sure these are her results?". And I said, "Yes".
    <br>The results did not correspond with the medication they had given her - everything was normal.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus. Come on, put your hands together louder for Jesus.
    <br>All her results were normal, and within two days she was discharged from the hospital and she went home.
    <br>Since then she has not had any side-effects.
    <br>She went to join her husband in the US and now we have our miracle.
    <br>Glory be to God. Indeed, now we have our miracle.
    <br>This is the record book of the antenatal examinations.
    <br>In 2008, this is the recorded pregnancy. It is written here, "Problems during pregnancy - none".
    <br>And then, "Labour. Complications - none".
    <br>And then they wrote, "Dead". This means that I delivered a dead baby in 2008.
    <br>Then in 2010, the same thing. "Problems during pregnancy - none".
    <br>And then I delivered a dead baby.
    <br>In 2014, these were the results of the scan which read, "No fetal movement seen".
    <br>"Spalding sign" - this means the baby was dead; there was no heart beat
    <br>and the parts had started disengaging in my womb.
    <br>This was the picture that my husband brought to the Prayer Mountain
    <br>and placed on the ground and prayed for me while I was in the US and he was here at the arena of liberty.
    <br>Madam, we rejoice with you at what God Almighty has done in your and your family's lives.
    <br>We know that many people have also been experiencing what you went through.
    <br>We want to ask you, what words of advice can you give to people who are also experiencing what you went through?
    <br>My advice is two-fold. The first one is for those watching from all over the world:
    <br>Believe in the prayers of Prophet T.B. Joshua because he prays in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Have faith and trust in God.
    <br>Believe that distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Anywhere you are, you can be touched.
    <br>And those here within the auditorium: This may be your first, second time or even tenth time.
    <br>Let me encourage you this morning. Don't stop coming here. This is the arena of liberty.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>We know that God Almighty can use any medium to heal us, to deliver us and to set us free.
    <br>And we thank God that He used the wonderful medium of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>That is the medium that many people have seen their deliverance, their healing and their blessing through.
    <br>We just want to advise you that as God Almighty has done this wonderful miracle in your life,
    <br>that you should stay close to Him,
    <br>make His Word the standard for your life and we know that the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can we just have a final word from you, sir?
    <br>What I can say is: Believe in Jesus, because without Jesus you are nothing.
    <br>I don't care what anybody says about this place, all I know is that this is the land where you can get what you want.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you are looking at me; you are hearing me.
    <br>I have told you my story.
    <br>You may have the same story; possibly even worse than mine.
    <br>But this is where I got my freedom, my deliverance.
    <br>You may say that there are other living churches.
    <br>Jesus is at the places where He is welcome; He is welcome here.
    <br>THE DEAD BABY WHO CAME BACK TO LIFE!!!
