    <br>Watch this interview from the beginning of TB Joshua's ministry.
    <br>What a consistency!
    <br>RARE INTERVIEW With TB JOSHUA!!! (TBN Europe - 2001)
    <br>Welcome to our weekly programme here on TBN Europe.
    <br>We are with the team here the whole week in Nigeria at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations,
    <br>seeing wonderful miracles of the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>And we will have an interview with Prophet TB Joshua,
    <br>the general overseer of this church.
    <br>First, I want to give it over to my friend, Pastor Ari,
    <br>and he will introduce himself and ask some questions.
    <br>Good afternoon, viewers.
    <br>This is Pastor Ari from Rotterdam Christian Life Centre.
    <br>We are on location in Lagos, Nigeria
    <br>at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations
    <br>where Prophet TB Joshua is the overseer.
    <br>I am going to ask him a few questions in an interview.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua, we thank you very much that you granted us this interview.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>We would like to ask you if you can tell our viewers something about
    <br>the coming into existence of The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations is just like any other living church.
    <br>The Church is the Body of Christ,
    <br>of which Christ Himself is the Head.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I am just a servant;
    <br>Jesus is the Founder.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So, He is the Head of the House.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The Bible says He is the Head of the House - the Church.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So, that is all about The Synagogue.
    <br>Did you receive any special directions regarding the foundation of the church?
    <br>Since Jesus is the Head of the ministry, He is the Head of the church,
    <br>everything about The Synagogue -
    <br>He is in control.
    <br>I am just a servant being sent.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>So, I am not the Founder.
    <br>I take instruction from Him.
    <br>He is the beginning; He is the end.
    <br>So, that is about that.
    <br>I am just a partaker of the divine nature.
    <br>Remember what the Bible says: When when we receive the righteousness of God,
    <br>we become a partaker of divine holiness;
    <br>His life becomes our life,
    <br>His energy becomes our energy.
    <br>Everything about Jesus becomes everything about us.
    <br>In Him we move, we live, we have our being.
    <br>In a way, you have already answered my next question,
    <br>because I wanted to ask you by whose power and in whose authority
    <br>are you performing all the miracles we have seen  here this week?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When we say 'miracle', Jesus Christ is the Miracle Worker,
    <br>and the Miracle Worker has not changed;
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>In Him miracles happen.
    <br>In Him we preach.
    <br>In Him we teach.
    <br>So, when we do things in Him,
    <br>we do it as Christ would have done them.
    <br>But if you don't pray in Him,
    <br>you cannot pray as Christ would have prayed.
    <br>So, when we pray in the power of Holy Spirit
    <br>- that is when we are baptised in the Holy Spirit -
    <br>we have enablement:
    <br>ability to move, to do things as Christ would have done them.
    <br>So with the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>one can pray as Christ would have prayed.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>What we are seeing in The Synagogue,
    <br>Jesus is the One doing it.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I am just being used;
    <br>I am a human being.
    <br>I'm a human, just like any one of us.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>If there is any difference,
    <br>if there is anything I'm doing you cannot do,
    <br>I believe it is the righteousness of God inside me.
    <br>Because the Bible says that when we receive the righteousness of God,
    <br>He is for us,
    <br>He is on our side,
    <br>He deserves our best.
    <br>Amen. So everything is done in the name of Jesus Christ in The Synagogue.
    <br>Not just only the name of Jesus Christ; He is the One.
    <br>He is the One because Christ is living in Prophet TB Joshua and also in us.
    <br>Prophet, did you receive any divine instructions regarding The Synagogue Church
    <br>from the Holy Spirit regarding the near future?
    <br>Okay, it is a good question.
    <br>Do you remember our message last service day
    <br>when I said that satan discusses our past,
    <br>while Jesus discusses our future?
    <br>So, when you look at the book of John 14 verse 2,
    <br>it says, "In My Father's house there are many mansions".
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This means He has planned for our future.
    <br>That is correct.
    <br>So, the future is for Him.
    <br>He is our future.
    <br>Once He has entered me,
    <br>He has put an end to my past.
    <br>And since he has put an end to my past,
    <br>you should expect everything about the future of The Synagogue to be from Jesus Christ.
    <br>And He Himself is the very future we are talking about.
    <br>So, concerning the future, the church, Synagogue is a church of all nations.
    <br>So, if you have not seen it in Holland, you should expect it -
    <br>any moment, any day
    <br>but we cannot do anything on our own.
    <br>So, it is a church of all nations.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>As He wills, He does.
    <br>That's what we are also praying about -
    <br>that God will do the same miracles as He is doing through you,
    <br>how He is using you as an instrument,
    <br>that He will use people all over the world,
    <br>and especially in the Netherlands,
    <br>that they will be used in the same way.
    <br>But what I meant is are there any specific directions regarding the near-future growth
    <br>or certain plans with The Synagogue Church?
    <br>Okay. You want me to tell you the mind of God?
    <br>Yes, as the man of God.
    <br>The mind of God, as we all know, is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>Since He's the answer,
    <br>there is no limit to what He can do,
    <br>and there is no limit to His grace.
    <br>We cannot get beyond God's love.
    <br>That's right.
    <br>We cannot get beyond God's miracle.
    <br>We cannot get beyond God's care.
    <br>So, you should expect something beyond human understanding.
    <br>That is for the future.
    <br>So, it is not something I can now stand here and start telling you.
    <br>There is no amount of words I can use to describe it.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>So, let me say, "beyond human undertanding".
    <br>Since we broadcast on TBN Europe,
    <br>we have a lot of response - in letters and emails - from Arabic countries,
    <br>and because we are subtitling this programme in the Arabic language, I want to ask you:
    <br>Do you have a word of encouragement,
    <br>can you say something for the Muslim people, especially in this time?
    <br>I don't want to go into religion,
    <br>because I am not sent to preach religion.
    <br>Religion brings about denominations.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>And when we talk of religion, that is where we can now say:
    <br>Synagogue Church,
    <br>Redeemed Church,
    <br>Muslim Ansar-Ud-Deen,
    <br>this and that -
    <br>that is religion.
    <br>I am sent to preach righteousness,
    <br>which is Christianity.
    <br>Our belief in Christianity: Love everyone and trust only God.
    <br>Whether you are a Muslim or not,
    <br>love everyone and trust only God.
    <br>So that is that!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Where there is love, there is no fight.
    <br>Where there is love, there is no dispute.
    <br>Where there is love, there is no condemnation.
    <br>Where there is love, there is no inferiority complex.
    <br>Where there is love, there is no fear.
    <br>Where there is love, there is no guilt.
    <br>That is my message.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I would advise everyone to embrace righteousness.
    <br>Everyone should embrace righteousness because righteousness exalts a nation,
    <br>while sin brings reproach.
    <br>Can I have a big amen?
    <br>Big amen.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Prophet Joshua, I have one last question.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Do you have
    <br>- outside The Synagogue Church here in Lagos -
    <br>do you have any affiliated churches or branch churches outside Lagos,
    <br>for example in Berlin or in Amsterdam or in Rotterdam or in New York,
    <br>or anywhere else in the world
    <br>either any branch or affiliated churches?
    <br>Yes, this is a good question.
    <br>People have been visiting here from all over the world.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When some people leave here,
    <br>they want to have a fellowship -
    <br>just fellowship -
    <br>because what they have seen here, they want to maintain that blessing.
    <br>So I have fellowships in the Western world.
    <br>Fellowship?
    <br>Fellowship - that is, when you get back to your country,
    <br>you can come together and say, "Let's fellowship and do the same thing".
    <br>"Let us fellowship and do what is happening in The Synagogue".
    <br>In The Synagogue, this is how we pray, this is how we do;
    <br>we call it fellowship.
    <br>It is not branches, but fellowships for now.
    <br>In the Western world, we only have fellowships for now.
    <br>Fellowships.
    <br>Because before you can have a branch in any country,
    <br>you must have a Holy Ghost carrier.
    <br>Yes, that's correct.
    <br>Because the Holy Ghost is the foundation of the Church.
    <br>Without the Holy Ghost you cannot do as Christ would have done.
    <br>You cannot pray as Christ would have prayed.
    <br>You cannot preach as Christ would have preached,
    <br>because the Bible says the Holy Spirit supplies inspiration for preaching.
    <br>The Holy Spirit supplies inspiration for prayer.
    <br>The Holy Spirit supplies inspiration for teaching.
    <br>The Holy Spirit supplies inspiration for doing everything.
    <br>In order to do things as Christ would have done them,
    <br>we must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>not just being filled with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Because the Bible says that not all that are filled with the Holy Spirit are baptised in the Holy Spirit,
    <br>but all that are baptised in the Holy Spirit are filled with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>That is true. We agree with that.
    <br>So that that means that outside Lagos, there is no church in the Western world
    <br>which can call itself "The Synagogue Church Of Germany"?
    <br>We have fellowships.
    <br>Fellowships.
    <br>This "fellowship" I have explained to you is different from a branch.
    <br>So, nobody is allowed to use the name?
    <br>I cannot go back to back to Rotterdam, for example, and rename my church
    <br>as "The Synagogue Church Of The Netherlands" -
    <br>that is not allowed?
    <br>If you are baptised in the Holy Spirit ...
    <br>Yes
    <br>If you are baptised in the Holy Spirit, we are one.
    <br>But if you are not baptised in the Holy Spirit, well, don't try it.
    <br>If you try it, it is a dangerous mission.
    <br>That's very dangerous.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Well, we thank you very much, Prophet, for this interview.
    <br>Messiah Television Network, Netherlands Interviews Prophet TB Joshua For TBN Europe
    <br>I want to thank Prophet TB Joshua for his hospitality here
    <br>and the capability of the whole crew.
    <br>We are really impressed by what we are seeing here:
    <br>The discipline in the Spirit which comes to fruition in the reality - in the natural -
    <br>and we thank you very much to be able to see this here.
    <br>I am a man of organising; I am a manager.
    <br>I have a very long career of being in management.
    <br>I have never before seen such a disciplined life. I thank you.
    <br>I am really impressed by it.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>This is a wonderful message,
    <br>but TB Joshua should not allow this message to go to his head.
    <br>No. We take it off!
    <br>TB Joshua just has to seek more of this grace.
    <br>The goodness and kindness -  he can still do better than this.
    <br>So, he should keep pressing to do better than this.
    <br>I read in your papers that we have to be a mirror of Christ
    <br>- you wrote something like that -
    <br>but you are an example of that.
    <br>Thank you, very much.
    <br>Thank you for being such a wonderful host.
    <br>We were all searching for one verse in the Bible,
    <br>in 2 Timothy it says, "Stir up the spirit of the gift," Paul said to Timothy,
    <br>"which are imparted in you by the laying on of hands".
    <br>And we were really looking for an apostleship.
    <br>We just said, "We want to do it from the fruits,"
    <br>and we saw the fruit, so I trust the hands.
    <br>Yes. That is the ministry of the Holy Spirit - because we have two ministries.
    <br>The ministry of the Holy Spirit  -
    <br>the Bible says the Holy Spirit opens our eyes
    <br>to see what is promised to us in Christ Jesus.
    <br>The Holy Spirit opens our eyes to see what  is promised to us in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit, we cannot see what is promised to us;
    <br>you will only hear miracles, but you will never see miracles.
    <br>You will only hear salvation.
    <br>You will only hear teaching and preaching in the power of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>without even seeing one.
    <br>But with the power of the Holy Spirit, we see what is promised to us.
    <br>Salvation is promised to us.
    <br>Miracles and healing are promised to us - and all of God's blessings.
    <br>But the Holy Spirit is the Supplier.
    <br>So, if you know Jesus, you must know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>If you say you know Jesus without knowing the Holy Spirit,
    <br>the only Jesus I know is Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>There is no other Jesus.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The apostles - because they knew Jesus, they knew the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Bible says Jesus was with them and the Holy Spirit was in them.
    <br>Jesus was with them and the Holy Spirit was in them.
    <br>So, if anybody claims to know Jesus, he must also know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Remember the message I passed across now,
    <br>that all who are baptised in the Holy Spirit are filled with the Holy Spirit,
    <br>but not all who are filled with the Holy Spirit are baptised in the Holy Spirit.
    <br>We never, I never realised that.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Very good teaching. Thank you.
    <br>Thank you.
