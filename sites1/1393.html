  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>No one is like Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you. You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No one is like Him. He is not a man that lies.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Everyone lies to his neighbour and whom can we believe?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Glory, thank you.
    <br>That Book of Romans 10:9:
    <br>"If you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord and  believe in your heart
    <br>that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
    <br>Believe in your heart; believe in my heart - what does that mean to you?
    <br>There is a word there - 'believe in our heart'.
    <br>This means our spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>I mean my spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>With the heart, man believes Jesus is Lord.
    <br>'Believe in our heart' means our heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>With the heart, man believes Jesus is Lord.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord!" That could be the confession of mouth
    <br>but with the heart man believes.
    <br>Where is your heart?
    <br>Where is my heart?
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus 
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>This means all other faculties are camouflage.
    <br>The heart is the real man - the main man.
    <br>Our heart is the contact point, communication point between the material world
    <br>and immaterial world.
    <br>THE HOLY SPIRIT NEVER WORKS ALONE
    <br>His activity is always in co-operation with you.
    <br>His what?
    <br>Prayer, fasting, preaching, teaching, 'amen'...
    <br>His activity is always in co-operation with you, with human beings.
    <br>Holy Spirit take more of me
    <br>Give me more of You
    <br>Holy Spirit
    <br>Holy Spirit take more of me
    <br>Give me more of You forevermore
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He never works alone. His activity is always in co-operation with human beings.
    <br>Lets someone say:
    <br>"Holy Spirit, take more of me; give me more of You."
    <br>Are you free? Your real person, your main person - are you free?
    <br>Your spirit, I mean your heart - are you free?
    <br>If you are holding offence, full of offence, bad feelings towards others,
    <br>whether you are right or wrong - you are not free.
    <br>If you are not free, your spirit - your heart - is not free.
    <br>Your heart is useless as an instrument.
    <br>Your heart is an instrument - a contact point for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Are you free?
    <br>If your heart is full of unforgiving spirit, pain of the past, hatred, bad feelings, offence,
    <br>your heart is useless as an instrument.
    <br>THE HOLY SPIRIT NEVER WORKS ALONE
    <br>His activity is always in co-operation with you.
    <br>But if you are not free, if your heart is not free, it is useless as an instrument.
    <br>I command whatever barrier to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever barrier - the barrier between you and God, the wall between you and God,
    <br>that unforgiving spirit, that hatred, envy, jealousy, bad feelings towards others -
    <br>be removed in the name of Jesus!
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA 
    <br>THE SYNAGOGUE CHURCH OF ALL NATIONS
    <br>Let there be relationship between you and God.
    <br>Let there be relationship!
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I say, let there be relationship.
    <br>Let there be relationship between you and God.
    <br>Let there be relationship!
    <br>I command that barrier to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That wall between you and your Creator -
    <br>be removed in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You know the barrier between you and God - envy, jealousy, hatred,
    <br>bad feelings towards others, pain of the past, offence -
    <br>open your lips and begin to confess this right now.
    <br>Open up; confess this right now.
    <br>Whatever barrier!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Whatever barrier - be removed, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever barrier!..
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>There is an inseparable union between the Word and the Spirit
    <br>which indicates that the Spirit always leads.
    <br>Whatever you say, the Spirit always leads.
    <br>This indicates that the Spirit will always lead in prayer,  in preaching, in teaching,
    <br>in conversation, in counselling.
    <br>The Spirit always leads - the Spirit of God.
    <br>He can never move us, He will never move us without being sanctioned by the Scripture.
    <br>It is the barrier that turned you into a servant, a slave.
    <br>You are not a slave; you a son to God.
    <br>You are not a slave - it is as a result of barrier.
    <br>There is a barrier; there is a wall. And what is that barrier?
    <br>The barrier could be unforgiving spirit, pain of the past, hatred,
    <br>jealousy, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold offence.
    <br>I command that to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let there be relationship!
    <br>That barrier, that wall between you and God - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That wall, barrier, hindrance between you and your Creator and your future -
    <br>be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>To pray in the Spirit means to pray in line with the Word of God.
    <br>That barrier - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>"Fill your prayer with the Scripture."
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Fill your prayer with the Scripture.
    <br>Whatever barrier, whatever wall between you and God - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That spirit of hatred - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That offence that is holding you back, pain of the past, unforgiving spirit -
    <br>be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>This is a prophetic word for you today: You need a free spirit.
    <br>Receive a free spirit!
    <br>Be liberated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace not to be ignorant of your faith.
    <br>We are always ignorant of our faith when trouble comes.
    <br>You have forgotten you are a Christian: "Why this problem, why all this? I don't know."
    <br>You go to the witchdoctor.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You find yourself drinking, smoking - you are just ignorant of your faith.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace not be ignorant of your faith
    <br>under pressure of temptation, under pressure of affliction,
    <br>under pressure of temptation, under pressure of affliction, under pressure of sickness, disease.
    <br>Ask God, "Give me the grace not to be ignorant of my faith."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>You under the dominion of satan, evil spirit, in whatever way -
    <br>listen, I command you to leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be cast out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You devil, evil spirit - leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever medium you are using to view us -
    <br>you are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Those situations you have caused, you devil - sickness, disease, affliction -
    <br>be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That disease in your kidneys, in your blood, in your fluids -
    <br>I command them to leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are walking to freedom.
    <br>This is freedom!
    <br>Freedom in your kidneys, freedom in your bones, freedom in your blood - freedom!
    <br>I cover you with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, be covered with the Blood of Jesus. 
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Rejoice.
    <br>Whatever you have as a contact point, right now stretch it forward.
    <br>Right now, let's pray for your nation.
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>Open your lips, pray for your nation, your leader - God's intervention, God's protection.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Right now, prayer for your journey.
    <br>Ask God for the grace not to be ignorant of your faith under the pressure of temptation,
    <br>not to be ignorant of your faith under the pressure of affliction,
    <br>not to be ignorant of your faith under the pressure of hardship,
    <br>under the pressure of whatever situation you are in.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Make us Your channel - Your channel of love where there is hatred,
    <br>Your channel of humility where there is pride,
    <br>Your channel of shining light, Your channel of obedience, in mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>I'm God's channel - channel of love, channel of humility, channel of obedience,
    <br>channel of faithfulness.
    <br>I'm God's channel.
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>Channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>I'm God's channel - channel of love where there is hatred.
    <br>I'm God's channel - channel of pardon where there is injury,
    <br>channel of forgiveness where there is unforgiveness, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are a channel - God has no mouth but your mouth to tell people,
    <br>God has no hands but your hands, God has no feet but your feet,
    <br>I'm God's channel.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You are a God's channel and you stand to be God's channel anywhere you are;
    <br>your miracle shall be permanent.
