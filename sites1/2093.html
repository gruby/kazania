    <br>Take the bag and make sure you pay for everything.
    <br>Yes, madam.
    <br>Take the phone and make sure you answer every call. I don't want to be disturbed. Ok?
    <br>- Make sure you get the list done.
    <br>- Yes, madam.
    <br>Let's go.
    <br>A bottle of water for you madam?
    <br>Me? Drinking from a cheap plastic bottled water? Please! Let's go.
    <br>It's not your lucky day, is it?
    <br>You could have told me that something was there.
    <br>Emmanuel TV

    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>Ok oh. This one. Ah.
    <br>I want that!
    <br>Excuse me, I saw it first.
    <br>I don't care! It is mine!
    <br>Excuse me, I had it first!
    <br>Do you realise that you are shouting in public?
    <br>Madam, for heaven's sake.
    <br>She has started again.
    <br>Let's be fast before she drives away without us.
    <br>This is an embarrassment.

    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>Is this me?
    <br>Come and be fast!
    <br>Mommy, she is so beautiful. But she is shouting, you know.
    <br>I told you before, don't stare at strangers.
    <br>And don't just look at what you see on the outside. Ok?
    <br>Here. Let's go.
    <br>Let's go.
    <br>Come on!

    <br>Oh God, I'm so hungry.
    <br>Where can I find just a few coins to get something to eat?
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>Sorry madam, I am in a hurry.
    <br>You don't mind?
    <br>Excuse me, please.
    <br>Could you beg your madam to consider me for any work?
    <br>I am ready to do anything. Please.
    <br>Water seller, you want to take my position in madam's house, do you?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- No vacancy for you!
    <br>I can't see anyone hiring you!
    <br>Have you looked at yourself? You need to take a good look at yourself in the mirror.
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>Ok, madam.
    <br>That, thank you. And one of these. Couple of these. Ok.
    <br>Emmanuel TV

    <br>I cannot pay my rent. Nothing to eat.
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>That's all I have left to get to my interview tomorrow.
    <br>Even if they give me the job, there is nothing for me to survive on.

    <br>- Oh, ok. The office is straight ahead.
    <br>- Ok.
    <br>Turn left.
    <br>No, actually you go around the corner, down the stairs, down the corridor and on your right. You just go in.
    <br>Do you understand?
    <br>Yeah, I understand.
    <br>Excuse me.
    <br>But maybe before you see the manager, take time to look in the mirror and tidy yourself up a bit.
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop

    <br>- Who will hire him anyway?
    <br>Emmanuel TV

    <br>You are welcome. Please, let's go to my office.
    <br>Madam please, I am ready to work.
    <br>I am not lazy. There are just no opportunities.
    <br>Please, I need your assistance with a job - anything!
    <br>I just gave the job to someone else.
    <br>But, you know what, you can enter. Take what you want. It's on me.
    <br>- Really?
    <br>- Please.
    <br>Thank you!

    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>This is a very good restaurant. Maybe we should try it. What do you say?
    <br>Yes madam.
    <br>There are some journalists around.
    <br>Don't bother. Nobody knows her.
    <br>This looks fine. Hold my bag or drop it somewhere.
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>Oh!
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>This is big news! We are on top of it.
    <br>His face looks familiar.
    <br>- No madam. We've never seen him.
    <br>- Are you sure?
    <br>That's James! Wow!
    <br>Who is James?
    <br>It's him - the man that used to hang around outside my supermarket, asking for help.
    <br>But I've not seen him for some time. He's the one! Wow!
    <br>- I don't remember.
    <br>- James!
    <br>James, madam! The man that tried to sell you water outside the supermarket, madam. The water seller, madam.
    <br>I don't remember.
    <br>The water seller, madam. He tried to sell you water and then he came and asked me for help to get him a job.
    <br>- Oh yes, I remember now. His name is James?
    <br>- Yes, madam.
    <br>So he became this successful?
    <br>From grass to grace. Wow!
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Victor, how are you? My business partner is here. Nice to meet you. We need to go.
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>- He is here.
    <br>- Who?
    <br>- The Man Of The Year is here!
    <br>- Man Of The Year!
    <br>- It looks like the owner of the restaurant is coming.
    <br>- The owner is coming? That's good. That's very good.
    <br>No pictures. No interview. No comment.
    <br>It is very important that we interview him.
    <br>- We have many questions.
    <br>- Alright.
    <br>Man Of The Year, thank you very much. Please tell us how did you make it?
    <br>Hmmm.
    <br>But sorry sir, how did you reach this level in such a short time?
    <br>Well.
    <br>Man Of The Year, can you tell us a bit about your background and what is the secret of your success?
    <br>What can I say? It may amaze you to know that there are some genuinely good people out there
    <br>always willing to help others and I am one of the beneficiaries of such people.
    <br>- That's wonderful.
    <br>- That's all. Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>It's ok. What more do you want to know?
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>Man Of The Year! Wow!
    <br>Talking about people who helped me.
    <br>- Who?
    <br>- See!
    <br>- Who?
    <br>- Esther! Victor!
    <br>It's nice to see you again, my brother. Thank you.
    <br>- You still remember?
    <br>- How could I forget?
    <br>You were the princess who treated a beggar so kindly.
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>And you were the kind-hearted stranger who gave me his gold when he needed it most.
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>Thank you. It's nice to see you again.
    <br>Please join me for dinner.
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>This is embarrassing.
    <br>You could have at least made me buy that bottled water at that time.
    <br>Would it have made any difference, madam?
    <br>Yes, because I didn't do anything wrong to him or bad to him, like you did, as you told me.
    <br>I'm sorry madam, but you always treat people as if they are nothing; as if they are beneath you, madam.
    <br>You've always enjoyed it, madam, and you still do, madam.
    <br>I'm sorry, madam, but you behave like a spoilt little girl, madam.
    <br>You! You are just ugly!
    <br>Spoilt little girl, me?
    <br>Emmanuel TV
    <br>Drama Workshop
    <br>When we see what we really are,
    <br>it's so hard to believe.
    <br>God's Word is a mirror showing us who we really are.
    <br>So if you were to see yourself through that mirror
    <br>what would you see?
    <br>You know, the real thing about you is your spirit.
    <br>Let us listen to TB Joshua advise us on how to take care of our spiritual life in this message titled:
    <br>THE REAL THING
    <br>T.B. Joshua
    <br>The real thing about man is not his body, but his spirit.
    <br>Man is a spirit being.
    <br>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23,
    <br>we are told that man is a divine being,
    <br>spirit being.
    <br>The real thing about man is not his body, but his spirit.
    <br>Man is a spirit being.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The real thing about me is not my body.
    <br>Because when you wake up in the morning, you do make-up, you do your hair, you look in the mirror -
    <br>you have forgotten the real thing, you have forgotten to dress the real thing,
    <br>you have forgotten to do make-up for the real thing, you have forgotten to put on more hair - wig - for the real thing.
    <br>But you have forgotten the real thing.
    <br>Whom are we supposed to take care of first?
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The real thing should be the first priority.
    <br>You are supposed to take care of the real thing -
    <br>bath the real thing, make-up for the real thing, take care of the real thing.
    <br>Because today, what are you taking care of?
    <br>Tell me how many times have you looked in the mirror and seen the real thing and know how it looks?
    <br>Some of us we look good, beautiful, handsome, but if you look at your real thing, this is the way you look.
    <br>Can you see? You are not taking care of it.
    <br>Some of our real things [look like this] and you look beautiful.
    <br>Sometimes when I see people moving around, and they have put on a tie,
    <br>when I now look at him to know the real thing in him, the real thing looks [like this].
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You will be very embarrassed when you see your real thing.
    <br>Can you see the life we are living?
    <br>You will be very embarrassed when God shows you your real thing.
    <br>Some of the real things look like this.
    <br>But you, you look beautiful, handsome.
    <br>You put make-up on in the morning, you wake up, you take care of yourself, you clean your teeth.
    <br>You say, "Ok, can you get me salad?".
    <br>Have you fed your real thing?
    <br>"Salad. Do you have salad here? No, I need salad".
    <br>And the real thing is suffering.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The real thing about me is not my body.
    <br>The real thing about you is not your body, but your spirit.
    <br>You cannot get involved in God's projects without your real self.
    <br>Man is a spirit being; you are a spirit being.
    <br>THE REAL THING
