  <p>    
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Every spirit that is not of God,
    <br>that causes you damage,
    <br>that causes you sickness and disease,
    <br>poverty,
    <br>setback
    <br>limitation -
    <br>I send this word to the spirit.
    <br>Right now, it is time for you to come out!
    <br>Remove your hand form my people!
    <br>You evil spirit -
    <br>I command you out!
    <br>Out!

    <br>Look at this young girl with blood dripping down her forehead from her scalp after the Mass Prayer.
    <br>She displays a tissue showing how much blood has been collected.
    <br>What could have possibly happened to her?
    <br>Let us listen to her telling us in her own words.
    <br>I had a fungal infection on my head that caused boils full of blood.
    <br>As the prophet prayed during the Mass Prayer, I felt the boils burst one by one.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>A few days later after her healing at Day 1 of the Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the young lady met with the Emmanuel TV Team to give an update on her condition.
    <br>Nayeli

    <br>My name is Nayeli and I come from Dominican Republic.

    <br>Dominican Republic
    <br>Here is Tania, my mum and my auntie Katy.
    <br>For over five years, I had a fungal infection on my scalp that was filled with pus.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I lost the hair in that part of my head and it was very difficult to hide.
    <br>I couldn't apply any hair product on that area because it had become raw.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I am into dance ministry and it was hard watching others have their hair done while I couldn't.
    <br>I felt ashamed that I had this problem.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I went to a dermatologist who gave me tablets to treat my condition.

    <br>My body rejected all the medication.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Can you please tell us what happened during the Mass Prayer at the Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua, here in Santo Domingo?
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua commanded every poisonous substance to come out,
    <br>that moment, I felt the boils on my head bursting one by one.
    <br>When I opened my eyes I saw myself covered in blood.
    <br>From that moment, everything changed.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Before, I experienced severe itching on my head and I couldn't resist the temptation to scratch it.
    <br>Since the prayer, I have not experienced any itching!
    <br>Also, my emotions have completely changed!
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I advise you to believe. Just as I received my healing, you will receive yours too.
    <br>It is not compulsory for Prophet T.B. Joshua to touch you before you receive your healing.
    <br>If you believe and have faith, everything is possible!

    <br>Tania

    <br>We are very grateful to God.
    <br>Never before in the five years that she had this problem had blood come from her head.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!

    <br>I am so happy and grateful to God that my niece was healed before my eyes.
    <br>I was a first-hand witness to what happened.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>We are grateful to God for using Prophet T.B. Joshua to minister this powerful Mass Prayer.
    <br>I know that everyone who opened their heart received at that moment.
    <br>Whoever believes will receive.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
