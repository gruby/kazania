  <p>    
    <br>Brother, can I talk to you?
    <br>Where is your wife?
    <br>You have a very hot clash with your wife.
    <br>It is true, man of God.
    <br>Very, very hot clash.
    <br>It is true.
    <br>In the world, we call it abomination.
    <br>It is true.
    <br>Is this your wife?
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>You are the wife.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Why do you allow your appearance to deceive you?
    <br>When you look at the mirror, you look beautiful; you allowed that to deceive you.
    <br>You allowed your appearance to deceive you and you want to destroy your marriage.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>What you did is bad.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>I hope you have confessed to him.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>I want to be part of this family.
    <br>Listen.
    <br>It is satan that wants to destroy your home; it is not her.
    <br>You know, I was saying something -
    <br>begin to reject any torture from the enemy of your soul.
    <br>It is the enemy of our souls that tortures us with depression.
    <br>"Ah, this man is... I'm light in complexion. I'm a beautiful woman..."
    <br>This is your wife.
    <br>What happened was to destroy this marriage.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>She has confessed to you, what else again?
    <br>It is a dirty thing.
    <br>When I was there, I just saw a very hot situation in the marriage.
    <br>Don’t listen to your people; listen to God.
    <br>Don’t listen to Mr T.B. Joshua, listen to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You did this stupid thing on your street.
    <br>It is not a distance but on the street.
    <br>This is your wife; you cannot get any other woman.
    <br>This is your father.
    <br>If this man listens to God, he is no longer only your husband
    <br>but your father because he has discretion.
    <br>He can say, "I will not take what God says, this is shame..."
    <br>but he wants to listen to God.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>He is your father.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Alex Tshiteta.
    <br>The woman beside me is my wife.
    <br>We are coming from Zambia.
    <br>Last week Sunday, the man of God located me and he prophesied into my life.
    <br>He asked me, "Where is your wife?"
    <br>I did not know where she was, so she came and the man of God said, "This is your wife".
    <br>I agreed, "Yes, she is my wife".
    <br>The man of God said, "What happened in your marriage was an attack from satan".
    <br>I agreed; it was an attack from satan.
    <br>We have not been together for 1 year and six months.
    <br>The man of God said, "This is your wife.
    <br>She has apologised for whatever she did - you have to forgive her".
    <br>The prophecy is true.
    <br>It all started way back, in 2016; we separated...
    <br>We were married when we were young, and I knew and understood her very well
    <br>I noticed that there were some things that began to change in her; the way she reacted and did her things.
    <br>I was expecting that she was seeing someone else.
    <br>Being an "IT personnel" I did not want to accuse her,
    <br>so I took it upon myself and said, "Let me find out what really is happening".
    <br>I downloaded a software on her phone that allowed me to have access
    <br>to everything happening on her phone,
    <br>whenever she was communicating, chatting - I was able to know.
    <br>As time went on, I began to realize that she was seeing someone for real.
    <br>Then I confronted her; she confirmed and said it was true.
    <br>I was furious and angry.
    <br>I decided and said, "If it is like this, you have to pack and go your way".
    <br>We separated - it is now almost 1 year and 6 months we have been apart.
    <br>Last week, when the man of God located us and prophesied into my life,
    <br>he told me it was an attack from satan.
    <br>He said that everything that is close to God receives attacks.
    <br>I began to understand that it was an attack for real.
    <br>After that we were prayed for and we were delivered and I begin to have the same affection I had,
    <br>some time ago when we were newly married.
    <br>After the deliverance and the prophecy from the man of God, my heart has been relieved;
    <br>I'm able to sit down with her and talk to her - we are now together as husband and wife.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ - put your hands together beautifully
    <br>for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who has restored this marriage to the glory of God.
    <br>You have said it all.
    <br>Right now, with your experience and what really happened, we believe you are in the best position
    <br>to advise all and sundry - what word of advice do you have to render?
    <br>My advice to everyone out there is that:
    <br>when you are exhausted in this life due to circumstances or challenges,
    <br>maybe in your marriage, business, or career,
    <br>you should not give up because your emotions may lead you astray
    <br>but God will lead you on the right path.
    <br>It is better for you to really find out what God is speaking over your situation.
    <br>Amen. You have heard it all.
    <br>Indeed, it is a wonderful piece of advice and it is all in tune with the Word of God.
    <br>When we make mistakes, as we all do, we should not run from God, but rather we should run to Him,
    <br>for an instant and immediate solution to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>Without further ado, we want to hear from your wife.
    <br>My name is Mrs Mary Tshiteta.
    <br>The problem that brought us here: we have been separated for 1 year and 6 months.
    <br>We have been going to so many places looking for a solution, but none was found.
    <br>That's how I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Last Sunday, during the service, the man of God located my husband.
    <br>He told him that there was a hot clash and abomination that happened in our marriage.
    <br>He asked my husband, "Where is your wife?"
    <br>That was when I came out.
    <br>I confirmed the prophecy to be true, because it all started with me.
    <br>We got married at an early stage.
    <br>We have 3 kids.
    <br>The spirit in me led me to start feeling like,
    <br>"Since I got married at an early stage, I don't know what is on the other side of life.
    <br>I don't know what is on the other side of the coin; a coin has 2 sides."
    <br>I didn't feel comfortable with myself.
    <br>So, I started going out to meet another man-friend, without my husband knowing or his consent.
    <br>After my husband found out, he confronted me and I confessed everything to him.
    <br>That's how he got upset.
    <br>He said, "If it is like this, you have to go back to your parents' house".
    <br>That's how I went back to my parents.
    <br>We have been separated for 1 year and six months.
    <br>That's how we came here and the man of God prophesied to us, prayed for us,
    <br>delivered and counselled us.
    <br>After the deliverance, the affection, the love that I had for my husband,
    <br>the love that we had when we were young is back, and we are able to relate together even better.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your lives.
    <br>What do you have to say to your husband right now?
    <br>I would like to apologize to my husband, because I have hurt him so much.
    <br>I brought shame to him.
    <br>I was supposed to be his wife but I became his embarrassment.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to apologize to him, to say that I am so sorry.
    <br>Mrs Mary Tshiteta & Husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Only Jesus Christ can justly do this.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for this wonderful restoration.
    <br>We believe the Lord has done it, and it shall remain permanent.
    <br>Finally, what word of advice do you have for all who are listening to you?
    <br>My word of advice to my fellow young ladies, women is that:
    <br>Do not be moved by what is happening in the world out there.
    <br>If you feel those emotions that lead you astray, it is better you run to God.
    <br>The Bible says he who finds a wife, finds a good thing.
    <br>So, let God lead us to be good thing, a blessing to our husbands and not a burden.
    <br>Let's run to God.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>It has been indeed a wonderful word of advice.
    <br>We thank the Lord Jesus Christ, who has used His able servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua to reconcile,
    <br>and bring this couple together once again and forever.
    <br>We pray as both of you go and make the Word of God the standard for your lives,
    <br>that this reconciliation and blessing will remain permanent.
    <br>And always have it at the back of your mind, that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
