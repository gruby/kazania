  <p>    
    <br>There is a gentleman there - you have piles.
    <br>As we are praying, you think it is all over but you now feel that you are bleeding.
    <br>It is a process of healing; God is healing you.
    <br>You are booked for an operation.
    <br>I don't see you doing the operation and coming out of that -
    <br>it is 50-50; it is very dangerous for you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The gentleman is there.
    <br>Upon hearing the prophecy stating his case, this man comes forward,
    <br>displaying a raw picture of the pile.
    <br>My name is Chukwudi Ugwu from Enugu State.
    <br>I am the one that the man of God prophesied about,
    <br>"There is a young man over there, you are suffering from piles
    <br>and you have been booked for an operation."
    <br>But I did not go for the operation because I was scared.
    <br>I am the one.
    <br>I have been suffering from the piles for more than eight years.
    <br>If I had to go to the toilet, I would be very scared because of what I am suffering from.
    <br>This is the confirmation of the piles.
    <br>If I go to the toilet, I would continue bleeding.
    <br>I have been booked for an operation but I refused to go.
    <br>Please, man of God, help me and my family!
    <br>After receiving and confirming the prophecy,
    <br>Mr Chukwudi came back the following day with good news -
    <br>his piles of eight years had been healed.
    <br>As the Bible says, "God's Word is health to all flesh".
    <br>Let's witness that truth.
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Chukwudi Ugwu, from Enugu State.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of God towards me,
    <br>by the prophet T.B. Joshua, through prophecy.
    <br>These piles have been disturbing me for more than eight years now.
    <br>My grandfather suffered from it, my father has it, my brothers and some of my uncles have it too.
    <br>Last Sunday, when we were in the service, there was a prophecy
    <br>that there was a young man who has been suffering from piles for some time
    <br>and he had been booked for an operation and that operation was 50-50.
    <br>So, I came out to confirm the prophecy.
    <br>I am the one.
    <br>It has affected us much; not only me, even my brothers, my father, even my uncles.
    <br>My problems started eight years ago.
    <br>I woke up one morning and I went to toilet. I discovered I was passing out blood.
    <br>That passing blood continued for seven months.
    <br>I stared seeing my anus coming out.
    <br>I started visiting many hospitals, herbal homes but to no avail.
    <br>In the last hospital I visited, the man said they would operate me
    <br>and the operation was 50-50.
    <br>I said, "No. I will go to The SCOAN, the arena of liberty.
    <br>I believe I am going to be free."
    <br>When the man of God mentioned my case, immediately I felt a cold sensation in my anus.
    <br>My legs and hands were shaking.
    <br>I felt it move too, as if it was going inside. So, I believed that at that moment I was healed.
    <br>From that Sunday until now, there is no pain anymore.
    <br>I used to have pain.
    <br>If I woke up in the morning, my body would be weak,
    <br>my back, my waist would be heavy,
    <br>but since that Sunday - Oh God, I am free like a bird in the air.
    <br>Before then, I could not sit down properly and I could not move fast, run or play football anymore.
    <br>I had pain every day.
    <br>In fact, whenever I felt like going to toilet, my heart would skip,
    <br>because I knew the pain I was going to pass through.
    <br>I couldn't even lie down or sit down very well.
    <br>If I went to the toilet, I would pass blood.
    <br>For the whole day I would be in pain.
    <br>But now, I am free.
    <br>This is the piles and you can see another one on my phone.
    <br>I snapped it with my phone and printed it out.
    <br>You can imagine the kind of pain I was having.
    <br>When I was in this condition, I didn't sit down, I didn't sleep very well, I didn't even eat very well.
    <br>But today, I am very grateful to God, I am healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Before now, if I wanted to sit down, I would sit with one of my buttocks like this.
    <br>I would just pretend - people around me would not know what was happening.
    <br>I would just be acting as if I was relaxing, but they would not know I was having much pain.
    <br>But now, I can balance, I can sit very well, I can jump, I can do anything, I can dance to the glory of God.
    <br>So those severe pains you were having then are gone now?
    <br>The pains are gone, everything is gone.
    <br>I am just free like a bird in the air.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we need God.
    <br>He is awesome.
    <br>I want you to believe in Him, trust in Him.
    <br>You can rely on Him without holding your hands on anything, and you will never fall.
    <br>Believe in Him and keep believing.
    <br>One day He will introduce Himself to you just the way He did to me, in Jesus' name.
