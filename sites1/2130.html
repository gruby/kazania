  <p>    
    <br>When God called His children out of Egypt,
    <br>He made a promise of healing and deliverance with them.
    <br>Today is your day of healing!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Today is your day of deliverance!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Your Life Is A Solution
    <br>Let someone say, "My life is a solution".
    <br>I will take my reading
    <br>from the Book of Exodus 31.
    <br>Then the Lord said to Moses, 'See, I have chosen the son of Uri, the son of Hur,
    <br>of the tribe of Judah, and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability
    <br>and knowledge in all kinds of crafts - to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze
    <br>to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds...'
    <br>In Genesis 1 verse 26,
    <br>God made man in His own image.
    <br>In John 4 verse 14,
    <br>Jesus said,
    <br>"I am a Roadmap to the lost, Bread to the hungry, Water to the thirsty,
    <br>a Companion to the lonely."
    <br>This means every person God created is a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>Everything God makes is a solution to a problem.
    <br>As a Christian, your life is a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>You should build your Christian life around this principle.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Build your life around this principle,
    <br>knowing that we serve God when we help our fellow brother.
    <br>Our position in Christ Jesus is enhanced each time we help our fellow brother.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: My position in Christ Jesus is enhanced each time I help my fellow brother.
    <br>Jesus stated in His mission statement in Luke 4:18 that His ministry was to the lost and broken hearted.
    <br>Just as Jesus Christ is the solution to the problems of all mankind,
    <br>so He expects us to be a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>Every true Christian should see giving to others as an assignment from God.
    <br>We are to find those who need us and what we have to offer,
    <br>and build our life around that contribution.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team has set out on a journey to find those who need them
    <br>and what they have to offer, to be a solution to someone in trouble,
    <br>to be a friend to the lonely, and to be a companion to the weak.
    <br>We should see giving as a reason for relationship
    <br>just as receiving is a reason for relationship as well
    <br>When we give we receive more of whatever we give...
    <br>Hello, this is Annette reporting for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Just behind me here is a woman who is 130 years old.
    <br>She is a friend of ours, a wonderful woman, and very soon we are going to introduce her to you.
    <br>I want to remind you that the Bible says that we will begin to succeed with our lives
    <br>when the problems and pains of others begin to matter to us,
    <br>and your success depends on your willingness to solve other people's problems.
    <br>I want to ask you, how many people's problems have you solved today?
    <br>How many people have you visited?
    <br>How many sick people have you gone to show your care and compassion to?
    <br>How any people have you helped today?
    <br>How much time have you given to those in need of your help?
    <br>Right now, we are going to see our friend who is in need of something that we have to offer.
    <br>There is no love that does not express itself in giving.
    <br>We are going to go and give to our friend
    <br>We want you to meet her; she is a wonderful woman; come inside with us.
    <br>Hello mama, how are you?
    <br>It is good to see you, how are you?
    <br>I welcome you all to my house, thank you for your care.
    <br>It is so wonderful to see you again.
    <br>We want you to introduce yourself to the viewers. Please tell us your name and your age.
    <br>My name is Alice. I am 130 years old.
    <br>130 years old, absolutely amazing, and still looking strong
    <br>and able to sit up by herself for the glory of God.
    <br>This is absolutely wonderful.
    <br>Mama, we are so happy to see you again, looking strong.
    <br>We are here on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV
    <br>and we have a gift for you, mama.
    <br>We have a cash gift to help you towards your daily needs, to care for you.
    <br>It is for anything you need to buy, like clothing or food - just for you.
    <br>Also we have a bag of rice this is for you to care for your needs.
    <br>We want you to know that Jesus Christ loves you and cares for you.
    <br>At the age of 130, it is a real blessing to have reached this age.
    <br>This is nothing but the glory of God.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>This is for you, mama.
    <br>Have you ever met Prophet T.B. Joshua personally before?
    <br>I have never met with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You have never met Prophet T.B. Joshua, but he cares for you and loves you.
    <br>He knows about your condition; that is why he has continued to support you.
    <br>He has sent us on his behalf to provide for you with this money and food.
    <br>So, we want you to know that we are here for you and we love you very much.
    <br>Well done everyone; I thank you all.
    <br>Each time I help someone in trouble,
    <br>my position in Christ Jesus is enhanced.
    <br>This is what Jesus meant when He said in Matthew 25 verse 45,
    <br>Whatsoever you do or fail to do to the least of My brothers, that you do unto Me.
    <br>In other words Jesus was saying here,
    <br>"I have no farm where I expect you to work for Me,
    <br>or an office where I expect you to help Me in checking files.
    <br>My office and farm are your fellow brothers."
    <br>On Wednesday 30 January 2008,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV Team set off on one of their missionary journeys
    <br>to carry out works of charity in righteousness,
    <br>in obedience to the commands of our Lord, Jesus Christ to be our brothers' keeper.
    <br>They set off to those who are in dire need of the love, compassion, mercy, goodness and kindness of God.
    <br>It was on that same day that they visited an old man named Ajiboro Osunla,
    <br>who had been abandoned in a dark room for a very, very long time.
    <br>Opening the door revealed a small dark room in a deplorable state,
    <br>with a repulsive odour piercing the murky atmosphere.
    <br>A closer look revealed an elderly man lying on a dishevelled bed in a shocking condition.
    <br>His sight had greatly diminished, due to the darkness of the room,
    <br>which he had been lying in for such a long time,
    <br>and his speech revealed that he was indeed very weak and feeble.
    <br>Let's hear from him.
    <br>My name is Ajiboro Osunla.
    <br>Please, can you take me away from here?
    <br>If you can take me away from here and take care of me, I will be grateful.
    <br>I am sick and I want to be healthy.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>There is nobody taking care of me.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Please if you can take me away from here today, I will be happy.
    <br>Did they lock you up in the room?
    <br>They have been locking me up in the room.
    <br>In his words:
    <br>"My name is Ajiboro Osunla.
    <br>Please, can you take me away from here?
    <br>Please, can you take me away from here and take care of me?
    <br>I would be very grateful.
    <br>I am sick.
    <br>I am sick and I want to be healthy.
    <br>There is nobody taking care of me.
    <br>Please, if you can take me away from here today, I would be very happy.
    <br>They had been locking me up in the room."
    <br>Put yourself in his position - rejected, isolated, abandoned,
    <br>and in dire need of someone who cares.
    <br>You can see the cobwebs hanging from the ceiling -
    <br>a further sign of the level of negligence this man has suffered.
    <br>The situation suggested there was no hope.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Is this where you urinate and excrete?
    <br>I have not been excreting.
    <br>I don't have food to eat so I have not been excreting.
    <br>It is only those who eat that can excrete.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>It is almost three months since I ate spicy food.
    <br>There is no food.
    <br>My children are in Lagos.
    <br>"I have not been excreting.
    <br>I don't have food to eat, so I have not been excreting.
    <br>It is only those who eat that can excrete.
    <br>It is almost three months since I ate spicy food.
    <br>There is no food.
    <br>My children are in Lagos."
    <br>Could this be true that the man who has living children
    <br>could be left to rot and die in such an isolated manner?
    <br>One could even wonder that such a man would be living in an entirely isolated environment.
    <br>But no.
    <br>He has neighbours, who do not seem to care whatever happens to him.
    <br>A practical demonstration was when the Emmanuel TV team approached one of his neighbours,
    <br>to please allow him into her apartment for a few minutes,
    <br>while they clean up his apartment
    <br>but she bluntly refused.
    <br>I can't put him in my room.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Our father here who is in a very terrible condition.
    <br>The room itself is in a deplorable condition.
    <br>Words cannot describe the seriousness of the situation here.
    <br>Everywhere is very, very dirty.
    <br>It is not fit for living at all.
    <br>There is a terrible smell everywhere.
    <br>And we have learnt from our father that he has not been eating for the last three months,
    <br>therefore he has not been excreting or going to the toilet at all.
    <br>He can hardly see, he has very poor vision and he is unable to walk far, or move about.
    <br>So, he stays alone, isolated and rejected in this very room.
    <br>The door is closed, no one comes to visit him, to see him.
    <br>He is left by himself completely and he is nearly a hundred years old, as it is now.
    <br>You can see some bread here, that our father has been eating slowly and slowly.
    <br>So, therefore you can see even the condition of his skin.
    <br>It is in a very terrible condition.
    <br>He is unable to move about.
    <br>He is very thin, very emaciated.
    <br>You can see even the clothes he is wearing;
    <br>you can hardly call them clothes, he has been wearing them for a very long time,
    <br>he has not been changing.
    <br>Basically, what we can see is skin and bones on a skeleton.
    <br>He has asked for our help, to relocate him, to move him to a different area
    <br>because this is not at all a conducive place for anyone to live.
    <br>If you were here right now, this is not a conducive place to live at all.
    <br>The room is very small, very tiny and there is a terrible smell.
    <br>Everywhere is dirty.
    <br>No one is here to take care of him.
    <br>There is no one to look after him, no one to take care of his needs, no one to provide for him.
    <br>He has barely been living, you can just call it 'existing',
    <br>here, with no one to talk to him and no one to look into his situation.
    <br>But we are here today on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team,
    <br>to let our father here know that someone does care - Jesus Christ cares for him.
    <br>And we also care for him, and we have a gift.
    <br>This is the gift of 5,000 naira for you, sir,
    <br>and this is a bag of rice, to take care of your welfare and your needs.
    <br>You can see - the rice is here.
    <br>This is the bag of rice for you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>As our father has made a plea to be moved to a different position,
    <br>we are here to help him and we want to take care of him.
    <br>So, right now, we want to take him out of this environment into a new, better environment,
    <br>where it is conducive for him to live and stay, and enjoy his last years comfortably.
    <br>We want to invite the Emmanuel TV Team forward to help our father here
    <br>move out of this environment.
    <br>We want to take you to another place now.
    <br>You want to take me now?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>But the work must go on, and it did.
    <br>As soon as the Emmanuel TV Team revealed their intention to move the elderly man
    <br>to another place, he rejoiced.
    <br>His reaction: "You want to take me now?"
    <br>He was glad.
    <br>He continued to praise the name of the Lord, saying,
    <br>"Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God!"
    <br>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
    <br>Matthew 25:45 says,
    <br>"Jesus Christ said, 'Whatsoever you do, or fail to do to the least of my brethren,
    <br>that you do unto Me.' "
    <br>In other words, Jesus was saying here, "I have no farm where I expect you to work for Me,
    <br>or an office where I expect you to help Me in checking My files.
    <br>My farm and my office are your fellow brothers."
    <br>Here, the Emmanuel TV Team responds to this instruction,
    <br>knowing that we serve God when we help our fellow brothers.
    <br>They have taken the man to another room, and they lay him on a reed mat,
    <br>saying he should relax, while they clean up his former room.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Look at the appalling squalor this aged man has been subjected to for such a long time.
    <br>There is rubbish and refuse all over the place.
    <br>Who knows when the room was last cleaned.
    <br>But the Emmanuel TV Team are cleaning the uninhabitable room right now.
    <br>Here is the Emmanuel TV Team who are taking care of baba's room.
    <br>We can see the state he was in.
    <br>There are even insects on the mattress where he has been lying for the last number of years - bed bugs.
    <br>You can see the remains of the food, bread crumbs
    <br>on this very mattress where he has been lying.
    <br>Right now, we want to totally clean the room.
    <br>The team is removing the mattress now.
    <br>If you look under the bed, you can see the extent...
    <br>The bed is now being taken out.
    <br>You can see; this room has not been cleaned for a very long time - a number of years.
    <br>These are the items that have been found underneath.
    <br>The disinfectant is being sprayed everywhere.
    <br>Right now the team is brushing the room,
    <br>the room that has not been cleaned for such a long time.
    <br>When we came into this room, it was totally pitch-black.
    <br>There was no light.
    <br>Dirt was everywhere.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>This is the amount of dirt and rubbish that was found in this room,
    <br>which the Emmanuel TV Team is now clearing out.
    <br>Viewers, if you could come into this room when we first walked in, the smell was absolutely terrible.
    <br>New cobwebs are being removed.
    <br>Earlier, some of them had gone down right to the bed, which is now being removed.
    <br>So, this is a total and thorough renovation.
    <br>The room was full of insects - different kinds of creatures who were thriving on the dirt and dust.
    <br>He was living in a world of his own, with no one to help, no one to care.
    <br>No hope.
    <br>These are human excrements that are being picked up from the floor here,
    <br>which had been lying there for such a long time,
    <br>with no one whatsoever to take care of our father's room and look after it.
    <br>Once again viewers - these are human excrements that you are seeing right here,
    <br>which have been lying under this bed for a very long time.
    <br>These are the human urine and excrements that stained the wall for such a long time,
    <br>with no one to help him to go to the toilet, his bed became the toilet.
    <br>He has been sleeping, eating and living in this condition for an extremely long time.
    <br>Right now it is being cleaned.
    <br>Viewers, just imagine what it is like to live in such a condition.
    <br>This is why it is so important to reach out and help these people,
    <br>to care for those who have no one else to care for them,
    <br>because if not, such a man would surely die living in such a condition,
    <br>if not for the renovation and support of the Emmanuel TV team and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You can see now the colour of the water.
    <br>It shows the amount of human waste and urine.
    <br>He was sleeping in his own urine.
    <br>As Christians, we are called to respond to all human needs,
    <br>just as the Emmanuel TV Team have responded to the need of our father here today.
    <br>Viewers, respond to the human needs in your community,
    <br>and let God use you as a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Right now the team is drying the floor that has just been washed.
    <br>Here we can see a new mattress that the Emmanuel TV Team has purchased,
    <br>as we are relocating our father to a new environment which will be much more pleasant
    <br>and comfortable for him.
    <br>So you can see the new mattress is now being brought in, laid on the bed.
    <br>This mattress will be much more comfortable.
    <br>And now the bed is being laid with fresh sheets.
    <br>He will be much more comfortable, knowing that Someone does care,
    <br>and His name is Jesus.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Under the bed is clean, as opposed to before,
    <br>when there was a terrible amount of human waste, human urine
    <br>and bits of food and dead insects that were found underneath.
    <br>And now the smell that was so terrible when we entered the room has changed,
    <br>and is replaced with a clean and enjoyable smell,
    <br>which is a major difference.
    <br>Our God of mercy and tender compassion uses His mighty power
    <br>for the relief of those who for no fault of theirs are oppressed and distressed.
    <br>But He has no hands but our hands to do His work today.
    <br>He wants to use your hands.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team demonstrates that whatever is in their hands
    <br>is a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>As the Emmanuel TV crew member lifts the aged man in compassion and love,
    <br>we are reminded that acts of charity and righteousness by faith in Christ Jesus go together.
    <br>Although the demonstration of love for the lonely and needy alone
    <br>is not enough to bring us to salvation,
    <br>it forms the basis for judging our level of kindness,
    <br>as turning the other way when our brother is in need
    <br>is equal to rejecting Christ Himself.
    <br>When you look the other way when your brother is in trouble,
    <br>you imagine you are only in the company of the poor, the weak,
    <br>the disadvantaged and contemptible people.
    <br>You will be made to know, perhaps when it will be too late,
    <br>that it was Jesus Christ whom you denied.
    <br>What is in your hands, viewers?
    <br>What is your gift?
    <br>That is what the Lord will use to bless others through you.
    <br>It could be your time, strength, material, money,
    <br>every good thing the Lord has given you.
    <br>There are many sick people in the hospitals around you.
    <br>Go there, visit them and show love and compassion.
    <br>Pray for them, pray with them.
    <br>Who knows - that may be all that is needed for their recovery.
    <br>Who owns this bed?
    <br>It is a new bed.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Did you relocate me?
    <br>This is where you were before; they cleaned it and put a new bed.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>The following week, the Emmanuel TV Team returned to the house
    <br>where Mr. Osunla was staying to respond to his earlier request to care for him.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Hello. This is Annette reporting for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Right with me here is one of the healthcare professionals
    <br>and we would like her to introduce herself to us.
    <br>Madam, please tell us your name and your profession.
    <br>My name is Hannah Iheanacho.
    <br>I'm a nursing sister.
    <br>I trained at L.U.T.H. - Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
    <br>I have 21 years experience in nursing.
    <br>So you are a nursing sister and you have had 21 years experience in nursing?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Have you had much experience in caring for elderly people?
    <br>Yes. I have been caring for elderly people: I have experience in that.
    <br>We would like to introduce you to one of the elderly people that we have here;
    <br>it is one of our friends - Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team would actually like you,
    <br>due to your level of expertise, your years of experience as a nursing sister,
    <br>to undertake employment.
    <br>We would like to employ you as a nursing sister, to take care of Mr. Osunla
    <br>and other elderly members in this community.
    <br>Would you be happy to undertake the position?
    <br>Yes. I'm very happy. I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I'm happy to take care of Mr. Osunla and other elderly people in the community.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for that.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>We can see the painters at work.
    <br>We are now starting on the second coat to make this environment one
    <br>that is comfortable for a man to spend the last days in a comfortable environment.
    <br>We would like to say "thank you" to all those Emmanuel TV viewers
    <br>who have actually helped, reached out in compassion and generosity
    <br>and given a gift, time, effort, money and every other good thing that God has given to you.
    <br>Having laid a new floor, fitted new lighting and unloaded a new bed,
    <br>Mr. Osunla's room is steadily taking shape.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Various household appliances have been provided,
    <br>and they are now being carried into their new home.
    <br>They include a brand-new fridge, a colour television, a fan, a wheelchair,
    <br>all for the comfort and care of Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Just as Jesus Christ Himself is the solution to the problems of all mankind,
    <br>so He expects us to be a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>We should build our Christian lives around this principle,
    <br>knowing that we serve God when we serve our fellow brothers.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Ultimately, we are called to respond to all human needs,
    <br>for that is what love entails.
    <br>There can be no loving without giving.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>We are now in the completed, decorated room of Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Many of you will remember before - this is the very spot where Mr. Osunla was found
    <br>in a very dark room, in a dishevelled state, in a deplorable condition.
    <br>But Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team came together with one vision
    <br>to make this a room that is fit for a human being.
    <br>And today we can see that vision has come to pass.
    <br>If you look around, you can see that now it is somewhere that is comfortable
    <br>for a man of his age to live.
    <br>They provided a fridge, a television, a comfortable bed,
    <br>a fan for the time when it is too hot.
    <br>Over here we have a wheelchair, which is called a commode wheelchair.
    <br>If we lift it up here - this will make it so much easier for Mr. Osunla to go to the toilet.
    <br>This wheelchair will be also able to take him outside for fresh air.
    <br>Because Mr. Osunla is doubly incontinent,
    <br>we have incontinence pads, which the nurse will be using to care for him.
    <br>Mr. Osunla also has a walking frame to assist him to walk.
    <br>This is basically being made available through Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV Team to let Mr. Osunla know that Someone cares.
    <br>Someone cares for the weak ones, the abandoned ones, the rejected and lonely in society,
    <br>and His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>This is just one of the many homes, that Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team
    <br>have gone out to help.
    <br>There are many lonely, sick people in the society, that need the help of you, our viewers.
    <br>They need you to reach out in compassion to give what is in your hands.
    <br>Everybody has something big or small to plant.
    <br>It could be your love, your money, your time, your strength
    <br>and every other good thing that the Lord has given you.
    <br>We just pray that this shall be an encouragement for many, who are in a position to give,
    <br>to give that gift that God has given to you.
    <br>We believe that this is going to go some way to make Mr Osunla's life much more comfortable,
    <br>comparing to the previous life that he was living,
    <br>a life that was not even fit for an animal.
    <br>And we thank God.
    <br>This is truly the work of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Jesus Christ has made it possible.
    <br>All we have to say is "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Hello, madam.
    <br>We just want to see if we can ask you a few questions.
    <br>We can see that you are very busy at work here.
    <br>Can you just tell us exactly what you are doing?
    <br>I'm putting the mackintosh so that it will protect the bed sheet so that the baba will not soil it.
    <br>So this is a mackintosh, a plastic...
    <br>We call it "mackintosh", to protect the bed sheets.
    <br>With the transformation of the room complete,
    <br>it is time to take Mr. Osunla to his new home.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Lying on his new bed, Mr. Osunla receives a tender bathing from the specially trained nurse.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>A freshly cooked nutritious meal is served to Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Your food is ready.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Here is Mr. Osunla enjoying his sumptuous meal, with the aid of a carer.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Right now, we want to speak to one of the other carers, who is also involved with
    <br>taking care of Mr. Osunla.
    <br>We will just speak to her here.
    <br>Hello, madam. Just introduce yourself to our viewers.
    <br>You can just turn to the camera here and tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Aina.
    <br>And you are one of the carers that Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team
    <br>have employed to take care of Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Yes. I have come to take care of him, cooking and cleaning for him.
    <br>So, you are cooking for Mr. Osunla, cleaning and taking care of his needs.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>Are you happy to undertake this position?
    <br>Yes. I am very happy; I am very grateful to be taking care of him.
    <br>Mr. Osunla, how are you?
    <br>Someone who can help me like this - the God he serves, will be my God!
    <br>The church he attends is where I would like to worship.
    <br>Mr Osunla is saying that on Sunday he would love to go to church and worship and pray.
    <br>And we can see that baba has had a change of heart
    <br>and he has accepted Jesus Christ as His Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Who else could justly do it?
    <br>It is none other than Jesus Christ.
    <br>Baba, how are you?
    <br>I'm alright.
    <br>When we look at the case of Cain and Abel, we learn that the way and manner in which we give matters.
    <br>The stingy soul is greedy to receive all the day long but the generous soul gives and spares not.
    <br>So spare not and give today!
    <br>Right now, we are going to go inside the house of one of the oldest members of the community here.
    <br>Are you ready? Come and meet our friend; let's go.
    <br>I am here on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua, and I am here with the Emmanuel TV Team.
    <br>We want you to tell the viewers your name and your age.
    <br>My name is Alfred Omole, and I am 110 years old.
    <br>You are 110 years old; does that make you the oldest man in this community?
    <br>Yes, I am the oldest in this community.
    <br>My colleagues died five years ago, and ever since then, I have never seen any of my age to chat with.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>God knows the heart of man and loves those who do His will -
    <br>just like Prophet T.B. Joshua, taking good care of the old ones who are suffering.
    <br>I pray God Almighty will help and protect him, and his goodwill to everyone will take him to the kingdom of God.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>One of the things that Prophet T.B. Joshua says is that God's servant should be under the control and conduct of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>That is what he does and that is why he sent us here today to meet with you and to give you this rice
    <br>and also to give you this gift.
    <br>That is for you, sir.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>I thank you very much and may God continue to provide for and bless you.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Our life is a solution.
    <br>If our life is a solution, how many lives are you capable of changing?
    <br>People want to succeed; people want to improve; people want to change.
    <br>They don't know how to go about it.
    <br>We are called to respond to all human needs.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I am called to respond to all human needs.
    <br>As a Christian, we should see giving to others as an assignment from God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: See giving to others as an assignment from God.
    <br>When you see giving as an assignment, you cannot afford to fail God.
    <br>Make decisions that will create the future you desire.
    <br>Those who are under the influence of this telecast, make decisions that will create the future you desire.
    <br>No one is created without a gift.
    <br>Each gift is meant to meet a need.
    <br>What is your gift?
    <br>Whatever is your gift - that is what the Lord will use to bless others through you.
    <br>I am a solution to your problem just as you are to mine.
    <br>I am because you are and you are because I am.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>The team is here to pay a visit to this home and to let them know that Jesus Christ feels what they feel.
    <br>Mama, we are from the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>How are you? What is your name?
    <br>My name is Lucas Elube.
    <br>How old are you now?
    <br>I am 110 years old now.
    <br>The man of God has been so good to us.
    <br>I thank him very much. May God bless him and honour him.
    <br>We have come here today on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team.
    <br>We are here with a cash gift and a bag of rice for you.
    <br>Mrs. Lucas Elube prays for the Emmanuel TV Team.
    <br>Viewers, we serve God when we serve people in need.
    <br>We serve God when we give out of every good thing that God has given us.
    <br>It could be our smile, our gifts of cash or any physical, spiritual, mental or emotional thing that you have to give,
    <br>but you need to be good givers.
    <br>If you want to support this mission, then log on to www.emmanuel.tv and find out
    <br>how you can partner with us and become more involved in what God is doing.
    <br>This is a relationship approved of Jesus.
    <br>It is not a one-sided affair - you have a role to play.
    <br>Acts of giving, charity and righteousness by faith in Christ Jesus go together.
    <br>If one is missing, you miss it all.
    <br>Discover yourself.
    <br>You might have been sent to a person or a people.
    <br>Find them and what you have to offer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I might be sent to a person or a people; find them and what you have to offer.
    <br>No one is created without a gift.
    <br>Each gift is meant to meet a need.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: No one is created without a gift and each gift is meant to meet a need.
    <br>How many lives are you capable of changing?
    <br>Whatever is your gift - that is what the Lord will use to bless others through you.
    <br>Moses was sent to a people and Aaron was sent to a person.
    <br>This means Aaron was a solution to Moses' problem and
    <br>Moses was a solution to the people of Israel's problem.
    <br>Those who under the influence of this telecast, whatever is your gift -
    <br>that is what the Lord will use to bless others through you.
    <br>What is your gift?
    <br>There are many people on the sickbed, in the hospital, around you;
    <br>go to them, visit them, show your love and compassion.
    <br>Pray with them and pray for them.
    <br>Who knows? That may be all that is needed for their recovery.
    <br>Whatever is your gift - that is what the Lord will use to bless others through you.
    <br>No one is created without a gift.
    <br>Each gift is meant to meet a need.
    <br>Hello. This is Annette reporting from Nigeria.
    <br>I am on my way to a meeting; many of you may have many commitments or an important engagement to go to.
    <br>I have an appointment for a meeting, but I also have a friend who needs my help.
    <br>That Bible says that we should give not only when it is convenient,
    <br>but we should also give when it costs us some pain to do so.
    <br>I mean at times when it is not convenient to give our love, our time, our kindness or our faithfulness.
    <br>But I am going to spend some time and give to a friend who needs my help.
    <br>Come and follow me.
    <br>We are now entering; here we are.
    <br>- How are you, mama?
    <br>- Thanks for coming.
    <br>- It is good to see you.
    <br>- Thanks for coming.
    <br>We are in the home of one of our friends, and the man beside her is going to translate for her.
    <br>Can you first introduce yourself to us? Tell us your name and your age.
    <br>My name is E.K. Falohun. I am 76 years old.
    <br>Thank you, sir. Can you tell us who is the woman sitting beside you?
    <br>She is my father's wife.
    <br>Can you introduce her to us - her name and her age?
    <br>Her name is Ajayi Falohun and her age is 126.
    <br>- You mean she is 126 years old?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>That is amazing, and she is still able to sit up and look so strong and healthy, for the glory of God.
    <br>From the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and Emmanuel TV, this is for you -
    <br>a gift and a bag of rice to help to care for your needs.
    <br>Thank you; God will bless you, and you will be successful.
    <br>Mama, do you know who Prophet T.B. Joshua is? Have you ever met Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>No, I have never met him.
    <br>We thank God for your life, that God has kept you this strong and healthy
    <br>and is continuing to care for your needs.
    <br>It is through the support of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team.
    <br>As you are watching, you have seen how mama has been cared for - she has lived to the ripe old age of 126 -
    <br>and this is made possible by the support of viewers like yourselves who reach out in compassion and generosity
    <br>and give from their hearts, for Christ's sake.
    <br>So, if God has put it in your heart to give, please don't hold back.
    <br>This is the time; now is the accepted time; tomorrow may be too late.
    <br>Whatever you have to give, it could be your money or time or strength or love -
    <br>every good thing that God has given you.
    <br>If you would like to send a donation or pledge you can email info@emmanuel.tv.
    <br>Alternatively, you can visit our website www.emmanuel.tv.
    <br>God will bless you as you give in Jesus' name.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Many are saying, "I have nothing to offer or give; I am very poor".
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Exodus 4 - Signs for Moses
    <br>"Moses answered, 'What if they do not believe me or listen to me, and say,
    <br>'The Lord did not appear to you'?'
    <br>Then the Lord said to him, 'What is that in your hand?'
    <br>'A staff,' he replied.
    <br>The Lord said, 'Throw it on the ground.' "
    <br>Moses felt that he had nothing to convince the people of Israel that he had a solution to their problem.
    <br>God asked him, 'What is that in your hand?'
    <br>Moses replied, 'A walking stick'.
    <br>The Lord instructed him to use it.
    <br>This means whatever we have in our hands now is a solution sometime, somewhere.
    <br>Because what you are having now does not solve a problem now or does not solve a problem here,
    <br>it does not mean it cannot solve a problem somewhere.
    <br>It does not mean it cannot solve a problem tomorrow.
    <br>In a situation where there is tension and pressure, laughter becomes a great relief.
    <br>Making people laugh becomes a great asset.
    <br>Tension kills faster than the gun.
    <br>That is why we have many comedians who regularly organise concerts of 'A thousand laughs'.
    <br>Our future begins with whatever is in our hands now.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: My future begins with whatever is in my hands now.
    <br>Jesus taught us that giving is one of the ways to multiply what He has given us.
    <br>Whatever the Lord has given you now is capable of reproducing.
    <br>In the Book of Luke 6:38, "Give and it shall be given back -
    <br>good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over!
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Today, everybody desires to be successful,
    <br>but the Bible says successful people are simply problem solvers.
    <br>You will begin to succeed with your life when the pains and problems of others begin to matter to you.
    <br>In other words, your joy and happiness depend on your willingness to help others solve their problems.
    <br>Thousands were spiritually starved and Jesus was Bread to the hungry.
    <br>He was Water to the thirsty and a Roadmap to the lost, and we are here today to find someone who needs what we have
    <br>and to share with them, give to them and express our love.
    <br>Here is one of our dear friends who needs our help, and we are going to go in there and show love,
    <br>doing what Jesus instructed us to do in Matthew 25 verse 40.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Who is this?
    <br>A white man? You are welcome.
    <br>First of all, we want to find out your name and your age.
    <br>My name is Foluke Lawal and I am 40 years old.
    <br>And who is this woman lying down to you?
    <br>My mother-in-law.
    <br>What is your mother-in-law's name and her age?
    <br>Her name is Folarin Lawal and she is 130 years old.
    <br>What is her condition presently?
    <br>She is sick; she cannot walk or sit up any more.
    <br>She eats in this position.
    <br>So, the woman lying here is 130 years old.
    <br>She has to stay in this position all the time; she cannot sit up or stand, because of her condition.
    <br>We are here today from Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV to present you with a gift, a cash gift,
    <br>and a bag of rice for you.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet; no harm will befall you.
    <br>Praying For Prophet T.B. Joshua And The Emmanuel TV Team
    <br>Mama, we want to ask you: Do you know Prophet T.B. Joshua personally?
    <br>No, I have never met him.
    <br>I am very happy and very strong now.
    <br>We want to let you know that we love you, that Jesus Christ cares for you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>And we want to let you know that it is a privilege and honour to meet someone of your age.
    <br>It is a real honour to be with you today.
    <br>YOUR LIFE IS A SOLUTION!!!   TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Jesus looked for those in trouble.
    <br>That was why He told His disciples that He needed to go through Samaria,
    <br>where he met a woman who had five marriages and failed
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Look for those in trouble.
    <br>Your life is a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>Rise up. Let us pray.
    <br>Lift up your voice; open our lips with faith in your heart.
    <br>Ask Jesus in humility - His eyes to find those who need me and what I have to offer.
    <br>We are called to respond to all human needs.
    <br>Say: I am called to respond to all human needs.
    <br>This does not however mean that the demonstration of love for the lonely, the weak, the poor, is enough
    <br>to bring salvation to us.
    <br>Charity and righteousness by faith go together.
    <br>The act of giving and righteousness in Christ Jesus go together.
    <br>The act of giving alone is not enough to bring salvation to us.
    <br>If you are a pastor, deacon or bishop, without the act of giving, without charity, it is not enough to bring salvation to you.
    <br>The act of giving alone is not enough to bring salvation to us.
    <br>Jesus has an eye upon it.
    <br>That was why He sat and watched how people cast their money into the treasury.
    <br>The act of giving, I mean charity, forms the basis for judging our level of kindness
    <br>because looking the other way when your brother is in trouble is equal to rejecting Christ Himself.
    <br>Open your lips with faith in your heart.
    <br>People want to improve, people want to change, people want to succeed.
    <br>They don't know how to go about it.
    <br>Ask Jesus in humility - eyes to find those who need you and what you have to offer.
    <br>Just as Jesus Himself is a solution to all mankind's problems,
    <br>so He expects us to be a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>This was what He meant when He said in John 17 verse 18, "As the Father has sent Me, so send I you".
    <br>In other words, Jesus was simply saying, "As the Father had commissioned Me to be a solution to someone in trouble,
    <br>so I have commissioned you to be a solution."
    <br>This is what Jesus was saying - He had created us for a purpose.
    <br>You ask Him, "Lord, You have created me for a purpose.
    <br>Lord, help me to find those who need me the most."
    <br>Our future begins with whatever is in our hand.
    <br>Let me give you a simple example of what I am talking about.
    <br>When you look at the Book of Luke 7 verse 13,
    <br>"When the Lord saw her, His heart went out to her, and He said, 'Don't cry.' "
    <br>In other words, 'Laugh'.
    <br>When Jesus met a widow who had lost her only son, He said to her, "Weep not".
    <br>In other words, Jesus wanted her heart to be at its best for Christ.
    <br>People want to succeed, people want to change, people want to improve.
    <br>They don't know how to go about it.
    <br>Your life is a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>Look for them.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel! God is with us. (Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you for your time.
    <br>I would like to take you to the Book of Psalm 91; I will take my reading from verse 14 to 16.
    <br>"Because He has set His love upon him, therefore I will deliver him, I will set him on high, because he has known My name.
    <br>He shall call upon Me and I will answer him.
    <br>I will be with him in trouble."
    <br>This does not mean He will keep him away from trouble. He is saying here, 'I will see him through'.
    <br>"I will deliver him and honour him."
    <br>"With long life I will satisfy him and show him My salvation."
    <br>It is not a crime to be old.
    <br>It is written here in verse 16:
    <br>"With long life I will satisfy him and show him My salvation."
    <br>It is not a crime to be old; it is the grace of God.
    <br>The major problem our aged ones have today is loneliness, isolation.
    <br>We Christians, we owe it as an obligation to give them
    <br>the kind of love, the kind of kindness, the kind of tenderness -
    <br>an even greater one than they gave us when we were too young to support ourselves.
    <br>They nurtured us to bring us up in love, care and tenderness.
    <br>This is the time to reciprocate their kindness, to reciprocate their tenderness, care, to them,
    <br>now that they are too old to meet their needs unaided.
    <br>Remember, in other parts of the world, there is provision for them; there is provision for the aged ones, the old ones.
    <br>Any nation, any community that neglects old ones, aged ones, neglects God.
    <br>Because it is not a crime to be old; it is the grace of God.
    <br>As it is written here, it says, "With long life I will satisfy him and show him My salvation."
    <br>Let us bring them together and integrate them into the society, just as we are.
    <br>Remember, people want to improve, people want to change, people want to succeed in life.
    <br>They don't know how to go about it.
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Lord Jesus, we ask You in humility,
    <br>Your eyes to find those who need us and that which we have to offer, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>You have created us for a purpose;
    <br>help us Lord to find those who need us the most,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
    <br>Remember, always, the best is yet to come!
