    <br>I cannot walk without the crutches!
    <br>You came from where?
    <br>South Africa.
    <br>I want to salute your faith.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>How do you know that you cannot walk?
    <br>Because I cannot walk. It is painful and the bone is broken.
    <br>And you have been like this since when?
    <br>Since Christmas.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Remove it.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name

    <br>I can walk!
    <br>Healed Of Inability To Walk
    <br>No Longer Using Crutches & Leg Support
    <br>Ok, you can walk. Don't run.
    <br>I have not prayed for you to run.
    <br>I have prayed for you to walk.
    <br>When you walk, you can run tomorrow,
    <br>but walk today.
    <br>I can't believe I can walk.
    <br>I have no pain.
    <br>Oh Jesus, oh my God. How is it possible, my God?
    <br>What are you saying?
    <br>How is it possible?
    <br>Oh my God. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I can walk! Oh God.
    <br>Before I could not even move; I could not step on my foot.
    <br>But now I can walk freely. There is no pain. Oh my God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>People of God, believe in my God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Healed Of Inability To Walk
    <br>No Longer Using Crutches & Leg Support
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Our sister came all the way from South Africa.
    <br>She is here to share her testimony right now.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I greet you saints in the name of Jesus.
    <br>My name is Busi Mngomezulu.
    <br>I am from South Africa.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>was the fracture of the bone of my foot.
    <br>It happened recently at home. As I was excited jumping up and down, I broke one of the bones.
    <br>I visited the doctor.
    <br>He said that I should not step on the foot.
    <br>It was so painful because the bone was broken, but it was not totally broken.
    <br>He said that if I step on it, it will break into two.
    <br>So he gave me a pair of crutches and a moon boot to support the bone
    <br>and the crutches to help me walk, so that I would not step on the foot,
    <br>because I could not walk without the crutches.
    <br>So it was in this situation that you came from South Africa to The SCOAN.
    <br>Can you just describe to us what happened in the service yesterday?
    <br>As I was sitting down the man of God walked past and saw me.
    <br>He asked me what happened
    <br>and I told him that I have got a fracture and I cannot walk,
    <br>and I am wearing a moon boot for support.
    <br>He started praying for me.
    <br>The amazing thing that happened then was just the power of God that I felt -
    <br>it is something that I have never experienced in my life.
    <br>It just felt like electricity or some forceful power that was coming inside of me
    <br>and it pulled me up, because I just saw myself standing
    <br>and I started walking towards the man of God
    <br>because I saw that he was calling me, but I did not realise.
    <br>Let's put our hands together louder for Jesus Christ.
    <br>You said sister, as the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua, prayed for you
    <br>you felt something like electricity go through your body.
    <br>Can you just describe again how that happened, how that feeling was?
    <br>The way I see it in my head, it is like bolts of electricity going through your veins,
    <br>or something coming inside of you.
    <br>It is an amazing feeling.
    <br>I can't explain it; I have never felt something like that before
    <br>and I don't think any human has ever felt something like that.
    <br>We can see here. You mean sister, at this point, that is how you just began to walk for the first time since this accident -
    <br>you were able to walk freely?
    <br>Yes, it was the first time I started walking freely with no pain, with no crutches, no moon boot.
    <br>I thank Jesus for the healing.
    <br>Ever since then I am free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We saw the way you walked in right now.
    <br>Just tell us, since the prayer yesterday, what are the changes you have seen?
    <br>The first thing I kept on checking right through the night was the swelling, because my foot was swollen.
    <br>It has gone down completely.
    <br>As you can see now, my feet look normal.
    <br>My ankles are fine.
    <br>I feel perfect.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>So finally sister, we just want you to walk one more time in the midst of the people of God.
    <br>Just walk for us and show us what you can now do that you couldn't do before.
    <br>Healed Of Inability To Walk
    <br>No Longer Using Crutches & Leg Support
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
