    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I can see that prophecy being fulfilled here today.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Let us first recognise our leaders here today from various areas.
    <br>I salute you.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>He who honours a prophet
    <br>because he is a prophet
    <br>receives a prophet's reward.
    <br>Thank you for coming.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Our Christian leaders
    <br>who have come together to make this revival possible,
    <br>I salute your faith.
    <br>God is our Rewarder.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you once again.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Here I am, your own boy,
    <br>without fast legs,
    <br>smoothness of tongue,
    <br>or even ability to inspire people.
    <br>I am here in your presence today.
    <br>I say, thank You, Jesus, for having designed and created me.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Yes, everything big starts little.
    <br>Don't forget, we were once embryos in our mother's womb.
    <br>See what you have become today.
    <br>I want to believe that today is better, tomorrow - best.
    <br>Thank You, God!
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Every Christian is a part of Christ's mission.
    <br>Jesus told His disciples in Acts 1
    <br>what can also be applied to us
    <br>that being a missionary is not an option;
    <br>it is what we are called to be.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I want to ask you a question.
    <br>What would you do with Jesus
    <br>as He is still standing on trial?
    <br>What would you do with Jesus?
    <br>Ask you neighbour.
    <br>What would you do with Jesus
    <br>as He is still standing on trial?
    <br>If you say that you are a Christian,
    <br>are you practising Christianity?
    <br>What would you do with Jesus?
    <br>Don't forget that to know Jesus Christ is to know the truth.
    <br>Jesus is the truth.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Before we start our message today,
    <br>let me get you prepared.
    <br>In order to learn how to serve Jesus in truth and faith,
    <br>there are three habits you must learn.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>In order to learn how to serve Jesus in truth,
    <br>there are three habits you must learn.
    <br>I call it "habit" because habit is a gift;
    <br>it's a gift of God.
    <br>There are three habits you must learn.
    <br>1. Talk to God every day.
    <br>Have you talked to God before coming here today?
    <br>2. Let God talk to you every day.
    <br>If you talk to Him, He must talk to you.
    <br>If you talk to Him in Spirit and truth, He must talk to you.
    <br>When you talk to Him and He does not talk to you, it means, you are talking to yourself.
    <br>3. Talk to someone else every day about God.
    <br>How many people have you talked to today about Jesus?
    <br>How many?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>How many people have you talked to today about Jesus?
    <br>He died for you,
    <br>He reigns in power for you
    <br>and He is still praying for you.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Don't forget.
    <br>We live in a two language world.
    <br>One - the language of the Bible
    <br>that God uses to heal, bless, create, save, judge, and rule over us.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Two - the everyday language,
    <br>this is the language that we use to gossip,
    <br>the language we use to tell stories,
    <br>the language we use to do business,
    <br>the language we use to play today's politics
    <br>and the language we use to talk to our children: "Leave the place! Don't be silly!"
    <br>Such language cannot be used to talk to God and to talk to someone else about God.
    <br>This is the language we use today.
    <br>That is why God cannot hear us.
    <br>That is why you cannot hear from God.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>We call it "everyday language"
    <br>we use to gossip,
    <br>to tell stories,
    <br>to sing songs,
    <br>to give directions,
    <br>to do business,
    <br>to play today's politics.
    <br>This is why after the politics, whatever we promise, we may likely not do it.
    <br>After the campaign, whatever we promise, we may likely not carry it out.
    <br>Such language cannot be used to talk to God or to talk to someone else about God.
    <br>You cannot use such language to pray, "Jesus! Jesus! Amen! Amen!"
    <br>You cannot use such language to preach, to teach the Word of God or to counsel.
    <br>These are the critical challenges
    <br>we have in Christendom today.
    <br>This will lead us to "The Integrity Of The Word".
    <br>So let me take my Bible to the Book of John 6.
    <br>I will quickly take you to the verse 63.
    <br>"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.
    <br>The Words I have spoken to you - they are full of the Spirit and life."
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Jesus says:
    <br>"The Words I spoke to you are Spirit and life".
    <br>Spirit - life.
    <br>Don't forget: The Integrity Of The Word.
    <br>This means, the Word is not complete without the Spirit
    <br>and the Spirit is not complete without the Word.
    <br>The Spirit enlightens the Word.
    <br>Without the Spirit, the Word will remain inactive.
    <br>Without the Spirit, the Word will remain everyday language.
    <br>Everyday language is the language we use to gossip, tell stories, sing songs,
    <br>to give direction and to do business.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Without the Spirit, the Word will remain everyday language.
    <br>That is, without the Spirit, the Word will remain without being.
    <br>Oftentimes, it is destructive.
    <br>This was what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>Without the Spirit, the Word remains idle, lifeless.
    <br>The Spirit lightens the Word.
    <br>This is what Jesus meant when He said, "The Words I spoke to you are Spirit and life".
    <br>Without the Spirit, when you say, "Jesus", you are talking of yourself
    <br>or calling someone who is bearing the name 'Jesus'.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>You know, people bear the name 'Jesus'.
    <br>I know many people who say, "My name is Jesus".
    <br>Without the Spirit, when you say "Jesus",
    <br>you are calling someone bearing "Jesus", not Jesus of Nazareth.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>God and His Word are one.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Don't forget, God is Spirit.
    <br>If it is not in the Spirit, it is not in the truth. So, it is all nothing.
    <br>I repeat again. God and His Word are one.
    <br>Don't forget that God is Spirit.
    <br>And His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and truth.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth, and so, it is all nothing.
    <br>The Word is God speaking to you.
    <br>Which means, the Word is the Word of God.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>"Thus says Jehovah" is repeated 2,000 times from Exodus to Deuteronomy.
    <br>The Word is always now.
    <br>Now!
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Before we come to the end of this message,
    <br>let's look at the Book of Colossians 3:10.
    <br>"...and have put on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge
    <br>in the image of its Creator."
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>The heart is renewed by studying the Word
    <br>and by acting upon the Word.
    <br>Take note.
    <br>It is not renewed by studying alone but by studying and acting upon the Word.
    <br>One may study the Word of God for years
    <br>but if he does not act on it, live by it and practice it,
    <br>he is not the doer of the Word
    <br>and the heart is not renewed.
    <br>Going by what we have learned today,
    <br>the sick ones can only be healed and delivered
    <br>by looking into the Word
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>and by acting upon the Word,
    <br>you bring Jesus into the scene
    <br>to heal,
    <br>to deliver,
    <br>to bless,
    <br>to set free,
    <br>instantly!
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>By looking into the Word and by acting upon the Word,
    <br>we bring Jesus into the scene to heal, bless and set free.
    <br>Peru Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Thank you.
