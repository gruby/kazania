    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>TB Joshua
    <br>QUESTION: There is a controversy surrounding the ‘Prosperity Gospel’ all over the world 
    <br>and this has seemed to dent the image of Christianity.
    <br>Man of God, what is your view?
    <br>ANSWER: The issue is not about prosperity per se; it is about the ultimate motive of the preacher.
    <br>John 10:35 says, “If He called them gods, to whom the word of God came
    <br>(and the Scripture cannot be broken).”
    <br>As God’s Word says in Romans 14:5 and 23, each man must be convinced in his own mind
    <br>because anything that does not come from faith is sin.
    <br>One of the greatest hindrances to carrying out God’s work
    <br>is the tradition inherited by Christians about giving,
    <br>whereby we have been taught to give and to expect nothing in return.
    <br>When we look at this closely,
    <br>we will see that it appears to be exactly opposite to God’s law of sowing and reaping.
    <br>Oftentimes, I hear Christians say, “Oh, I give because I want to give; I expect nothing in return,”
    <br>instead of saying, “I give because God wants me to give.”
    <br>To be sure, many charitable organisations around the world are not Christian
    <br>but they give as well as help and care for others.
    <br>Suppose a farmer said, “I sow in my fields each spring
    <br>because I just love to plant seeds but I expect no harvest.”
    <br>How could he continue farming?
    <br>Of course, the good farmer expects a good harvest!
    <br>Good seeds always produce returns in incredible multiples!
    <br>It is God’s will for you to reap more than you sow.
    <br>The point is that you must keep your eyes on God, not on the means He might use.
    <br>He and He alone is the Source of your expectations.
    <br>It is certainly more productive to give than to receive,
    <br>since only what one gives is multiplied back to him, not what he receives.
    <br>You cannot afford just to give your money because you get a blessing out of giving.
    <br>Your giving must be productive.
    <br>If your giving does not produce a return of more than you give,
    <br>how will evangelism be financed tomorrow?
    <br>In 1 Kings 17:11-16, Elijah directed the Widow of Zarephath to bake him a cake first.
    <br>This seemed cruel and heartless but when she obeyed,
    <br>it was like a farmer planting his choice seed – because it was God who had spoken.
    <br>That last cake became her seed cake!
    <br>It produced an abundant return of much more than she gave to Elijah.
    <br>Her barrel wasted not nor did her cruse of oil fail.
    <br>When you give, you must receive more,
    <br>as Jesus said, in good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over!
    <br>That is, an abundant return.
    <br>God’s pact of plenty cannot fail. It is as sure as John 3:16.
