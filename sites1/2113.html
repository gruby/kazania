  <p>    
    <br>Concerning the ongoing situation in the world,
    <br>I have received thousands of emails on the pandemic vaccine.
    <br>No doubt, there are many conspiracy theories surrounding this vaccine.
    <br>However, my belief is that
    <br>our governments are only trying to look for a way out of this very challenging situation,
    <br>although there may be bad faith in certain quarters.
    <br>Many people have complained of some negative reactions
    <br>but this is always the case with vaccines of this nature.
    <br>I remember, I used to have such reactions whenever I took chloroquine.
    <br>That does not mean chloroquine is bad. It works positively for many.
    <br>At this time, our governments need our support
    <br>and our cooperation because the world is in a dilemma.
    <br>God bless you!
    <br>Emmanuel!
