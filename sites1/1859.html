    <br>My name is Masindi Mugari; I come from South Africa.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I'm addicted to eating sand.
    <br>I have been eating sand for 15 years.
    <br>The day that I started to eat sand, it was raining outside.
    <br>I perceived the smell of sand and I went outside and felt I could eat the sand.
    <br>I heard a voice saying that I could eat the sand so I started to eat it.
    <br>The following day, I went to the same place and ate the sand.
    <br>When I am eating sand, it feels good.
    <br>If you put all the food on the table, it does not taste good but the sand tastes good when I eat it.
    <br>Every day, when I wake up, after drinking tea, I must eat sand.
    <br>After eating dinner, I must eat sand.
    <br>Even when I go to sleep, after eating food, I must eat sand.
    <br>I'm here because I've seen many people eating sand like me
    <br>who were delivered after prayer from the man of God.
    <br>I have suffered a lot for 15 years.
    <br>Please, man of God, deliver me!
    <br>I have it with me in my bag that I brought here from South Africa.
    <br>I have the sand in my bag.
    <br>TB JOSHUA REBUKES STRANGE ADDICTION TO EATING SAND!!!
    <br>Tell us the efforts you have made to stop this.
    <br>Or do you just consider it as food?
    <br>I tried to stop eating sand but I could not stop.
    <br>What have you done in the past?
    <br>I tried eating chocolate or popcorn so I could stop eating sand but it didn't work.
    <br>I went to different places to help me stop, but I didn't stop.
    <br>Tell us again, how did you come about this?
    <br>I started eating sand when it was raining outside and I perceived the smell of sand
    <br>and heard a voice telling me that I could eat the sand.
    <br>Then I started to eat.
    <br>You listen to that.
    <br>She heard a voice in her ear, whispering notions, 'eat sand, eat sand'.
    <br>So, come here.
    <br>Father, thank You.
    <br>Holding the sand in her hands, she comes forward to receive her deliverance.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!

    <br>Rise up!
    <br>She slowly sits up, overcome at the mighty deliverance that has taken place.
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>I fell down.
    <br>I started to feel dizzy.
    <br>OK, stand up; give her the sand and let us see.

    <br>She is normal now; before now she was possessed.
    <br>Can you close you eyes and put it in your mouth?
    <br>TB JOSHUA REBUKES STRANGE ADDICTION TO EATING SAND!!!
    <br>I'm delivered! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TB JOSHUA REBUKES STRANGE ADDICTION TO EATING SAND!!!
    <br>After her deliverance, Masindi begins to walk in the light of her testimony.
    <br>She washes her mouth and begins to eat the delicious food
    <br>that has been placed before her.
    <br>She enjoys every mouthful of the food,
    <br>clear evidence that her past addiction to eating sand is now over.
    <br>She has been delivered from the kingdom of darkness
    <br>and is now in God's marvellous light.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Masindi Mugari; I come from South Africa.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that
    <br>I was addicted to eating sand for 15 years.
    <br>So, the man of God prayed for me and after he prayed for me,
    <br>I tasted it and it was so tasteless.
    <br>Now, I feel good and I am delivered in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>My advice is that as children of God, we must know that God
    <br>is aware of our sicknesses and He cannot leave us without healing us.
    <br>I give glory to God because this sand had affected me a lot.
    <br>I could not even work; it caused many diseases in my body.
    <br>Now, I am free! I sleep well.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I'm free, I'm delivered!
