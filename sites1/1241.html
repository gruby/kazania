  <p>    
    <br>On the 21st of October, 2018, during The SCOAN Live Sunday Service,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua delivered a prophetic message regarding an ex-president.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>For some time now, I have not been dabbling into international issues.
    <br>This one is very close.
    <br>A president who is very sick outside this country,
    <br>I am seeing death; this is death.
    <br>They will try to revive him but no way.
    <br>He has been an ex before now.
    <br>They will try all efforts to revive him but no way.
    <br>Open your lips and pray for God's intervention.
    <br>A sudden death.
    <br>They will try to revive in whatever way.
    <br>So, you just pray.
    <br>Let the will of God be done.
