  <p>    
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me! I cannot walk due to a fractured femur.
    <br>For one year now, I cannot do anything on my own.
    <br>I cannot walk; I cannot go to my workplace.
    <br>I cannot even take a bath without the help of my wife.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me!
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up. Don't run, walk gently.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus; I'm free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus; I can walk now!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Joshua Sunday Oladele.
    <br>The lady beside me is my beautiful wife.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was a fracture of the femur.
    <br>It happened in 2014.
    <br>To the glory of God, I came here in 2015, met the man of God who laid hands on me and prayed for me.
    <br>I stood up and since then, I began to walk.
    <br>Before coming to The SCOAN, I had tried many places.
    <br>The very first day the accident happened, I was taken to the hospital.
    <br>I also went to a herbalist and stayed at his place for three months.
    <br>After three months, he asked me to go and buy crutches to be using for walking. I would be okay.
    <br>I bought the crutches, and I left that place.
    <br>When I got home, I realised that the bone was not joined.
    <br>So I went to another herbalist.
    <br>In fact, I tried so many herbalists.
    <br>At the end of the day, we realised that this situation was not ordinary.
    <br>We started moving from church to church for deliverance.
    <br>Still, there was no solution.
    <br>God finally directed me to The SCOAN.
    <br>I was opportune to meet the man of God.
    <br>Immediately he touched me, I stood up and walked.
    <br>Before, I could not go to my working place.
    <br>I even lost my job during the period I had the problem
    <br>because the accident did not happen during working hours,
    <br>When they expected me to return to work in time and they saw that I could not resume back to my duty,
    <br>they sent my payoff to me.
    <br>It was very difficult to feed because I was the breadwinner of the family.
    <br>I could not go to work.
    <br>My wife was the one taking care of me.
    <br>I couldn't even take my bath or go to the toilet by myself.
    <br>In fact, it was very  difficult.
    <br>But after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua, you are able to do all those things you could not do then.
    <br>After the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua, for the very first time, I stood up and walked without crutches.
    <br>Ok, there is one thing we want to ask you.
    <br>What was happening to you when the man of God was praying for you because we saw your leg moving?
    <br>Tell us - what were you feeling then as the man of God was praying for you?
    <br>When man of God tapped my leg, I felt heat.
    <br>When he asked me to stand up, I felt as if something fell down from my leg.
    <br>I felt a ring, something - I sensed that something dropped from my leg.
    <br>He then asked me to move.
    <br>That was how I began to walk.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for the miracle working Jesus!
    <br>With what the Lord has done in your life, setting you free from that problem,
    <br>what word of advice do you have for people listening to you all around the world?
    <br>My word of advice to viewers all around the world and everybody watching me right now is that
    <br>we should have faith in God.
    <br>Just as the man of God always says,  when you have a problem, you should come to God,
    <br>don't run away from God.
    <br>In my case, it was when I came to The SCOAN that I received my healing without paying a penny or naira.
    <br>At the other places that I went to before, I spent a lot of money - some would charge me 50,000 naira,
    <br>at the very first place they charged me 80,000 naira, the second 50,000 naira, some 40,000 naira.
    <br>So what you are telling us is that when you came to The SCOAN, and God used Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to pray for you in the name of Jesus Christ and you were set you free, no money was collected from you?
    <br>No money was collected from me. It was free of charge.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's hear from your wife.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Temitope Oladele. The man standing beside me is my husband.
    <br>I thank God today because I'm very happy.
    <br>When we came here two years ago and met Prophet T.B. Joshua here,
    <br>he prayed for my husband and my husband walked instantly.
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>It wasn't easy because I was the only one helping him
    <br>and taking care of the children as well as providing food. It was me that was doing everything.
    <br>- But after the prayer and he was set free, he can do everything on his own.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- And you are very happy about that.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in your life.
    <br>Can you just exercise your body and let the people see what the Lord has done for you -
    <br>those things you could not do then.
    <br>Then I couldn't stand and walk like this.
    <br>But now, I can stand on this leg, I can move and run.
    <br>Glory be to God in the highest.
