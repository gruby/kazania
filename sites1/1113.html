    <br>As the New Morning Water sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua is being ministered
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ during The SCOAN Sunday live service,
    <br>God's mighty power is clearly demonstrated
    <br>as the demons in the people are exposed and react against their will.
    <br>Watch how the New Morning Water is used to set this man free from his bondage.
    <br>This is the glory of God!
    <br>Voice out - who are you?
    <br>Who are you, demon?
    <br>I am the devil.
    <br>Ok. How many of you are in this body?
    <br>Two.
    <br>Who is number two?
    <br>Queen of the coast.
    <br>Ok. As the devil, what have you done to him?
    <br>I don't want him to serve God; he was dedicated to me at birth.
    <br>He was dedicated to you?
    <br>They gave him to me!
    <br>Ok. What have you used him to do as the devil?
    <br>I want him to smoke and womanise but he has been failing me.
    <br>How do you use him to womanise?
    <br>I send women in their 40's and 50's.
    <br>How old is he?
    <br>He is 34 years old.
    <br>You send women who are older than him.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok. What do you do to those women?
    <br>How do you destroy them?
    <br>I want him to sleep with them and I pay them.
    <br>As the queen of the coast, what have you done to him?
    <br>I am in his stomach. Here.
    <br>I want him to operate and look for women.
    <br>You want him to look for women? So you gave him the spirit of lust?
    <br>Yes, I send them in numbers.
    <br>Why are you embarrassing me like this? Allow me to go!
    <br>They gave him to me. I scattered his finances.
    <br>I destroyed everything. They gave him to me at birth.
    <br>I don't want him to serve Jesus! I don't like that Name; it disturbs my peace.
    <br>I don't like this place; he shouldn't have come to this place.
    <br>How did you enter him?
    <br>I entered him through fornication.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, our father in the Lord, has sent this New Morning Water
    <br>and this is the power of God!
    <br>This is the glory of God!
    <br>You are coming out of this body!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Through The New Morning Water
    <br>Come out! Come back again!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Vomit it out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Vomit it out! Out!
    <br>Vomit it out! Every demonic power!
    <br>You queen of the coast - come out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>This is the power of God!
    <br>This is the glory of God!
    <br>You are coming out of this body!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In Jesus' name, you are free!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Where are you going?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>You were what?
    <br>I was seated there.
    <br>Why are you here?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>You have been delivered through the New Morning Water sent by our father in the Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Good morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Ian Phiri. I am a Zambian.
    <br>I was possessed by a spirit of the devil and the queen of the coast.
    <br>This spirit used to torment me in ways that I would have an urge -
    <br>a serious urge only to sleep with women that were older than me.
    <br>How it came about: I used to play football.
    <br>I went to Mozambique because I wanted to better my life.
    <br>I went to Mozambique because I wanted things to start moving well for me
    <br>because things were so bad at that time.
    <br>When I went to Mozambique, I went to a shrine where I found a fetish priest - a witch doctor
    <br>who told me that he was going to give me power to play good football and make it in life.
    <br>It was my friend who took me there that afternoon.
    <br>When we met this witch doctor, he told me he was going to bath me in something to fortify me
    <br>so that I would be strong, play football and make it really big in life.
    <br>So that afternoon, he took me to his place
    <br>and then he started boiling water in a very big pot - a black pot.
    <br>As it was boiling, he told me to stand and not run, no matter what happens.
    <br>So I had to stand and wait.
    <br>He told me that the moment I ran out of this place, I would go mad.
    <br>So I stood and he told me to strip but it was broad daylight.
    <br>He told me to strip, that no one would see me. It was about 10 am.
    <br>That's how he got this water and when he splashed it on me,
    <br>when it came close to me, it was so very hot.
    <br>After that, he told me to go past his wife's legs like this.
    <br>When he told me to pass through his legs, I should then just go and never turn back
    <br>and go to wherever I was going.
    <br>When I came to Zambia, things became so very bad.
    <br>I always had a serious urge and I had power all over my body - even in my eyes.
    <br>Every time I looked at a woman - be it in a club - with this power, if I just looked at her once
    <br>or twice, I would just command her to follow me and the woman would follow me.
    <br>I would just be womanising, smoking and drinking all the time.
    <br>After that experience, things were so horribly bad that I couldn't even understand it.
    <br>You said you were into a football career
    <br>and then you really wanted to boost up your football career.
    <br>You went to Mozambique and entered a shrine where you were introduced to a witch doctor
    <br>who prepared a charm for you and poured it on your body.
    <br>Instantly they poured that charm on your body, could you tell us what started happening to you
    <br>and what kind of dreams were you having that manifested in the physical in your entire life?
    <br>I would be with a woman, sleeping with me.
    <br>Every time this woman slept with me, things wouldn't work out; they would be so bad.
    <br>I would then have this urge to just chase women all the time.
    <br>I would be just chasing women -
    <br>I could not hold myself until I slept with a woman.
    <br>That is what used to happen.
    <br>And you said that instantly after you were initiated in that shrine,
    <br>you were possessed with this spirit that really made you to become a womaniser.
    <br>You were also given a power in your eyes.
    <br>Tell us - what normally happened with this power in your eyes?
    <br>How did it go, as far as destroying your life entirely?
    <br>This power was like to command women.
    <br>If I went to a club to drink, even if she was there with man beside her,
    <br>I would just look at her the first time.
    <br>The second or third time, if she went to the toilet,  I would follow her
    <br>and tell her, "Leave him and follow me" and that would happen.
    <br>Even if it was a married woman with a husband?
    <br>Yes, such things would happen.
    <br>Tell us how often this happened before your deliverance.
    <br>I couldn't rest. Every time I would be looking at women.
    <br>If it was not me telling them to come with me,
    <br>it would be them - the other way round. It would be just like that.
    <br>Every time you looked at them, they would not resist it.
    <br>They could not resist it.
    <br>From that time that I went to that shrine, my soccer career crumbled.
    <br>I couldn't play football anymore.
    <br>Everything was so bad.
    <br>I couldn't hold myself. Everything was so...
    <br>I started living a very reckless life.
    <br>I could not even have money in my pocket.
    <br>Everything was scattered.
    <br>Ok. Now tell us how you came to know about The SCOAN.
    <br>I came to know about The SCOAN through a pastor
    <br>who is in love with the man of God and this ministry.
    <br>He started telling me about this ministry
    <br>and how I would get my deliverance, once I came to this place.
    <br>So he started helping me in prayer.
    <br>I thank God for his life because he really tried during the time I came here.
    <br>Can you now tell us what happened last Sunday
    <br>that brought about your deliverance and testimony today.
    <br>Ok. On Sunday, I sat somewhere there.
    <br>I first wanted to leave that place because it was getting hot in here.
    <br>I couldn't hold myself.
    <br>At first, I went out and after a while, I came back and sat down somewhere there.
    <br>As she was coming close to me, I couldn't hold myself. I was shaking.
    <br>I wanted to run.
    <br>The moment she sprayed the Morning Water on me,
    <br>it was like a huge fire that came on my body.
    <br>That's when I started manifesting; I couldn't hold myself.
    <br>I felt this strength in me that I couldn't hold like a fire that was burning all over me.
    <br>Starting from the time the man of God introduced the Morning Water,
    <br>what do you say about it that brought about your preparation for the receiving?
    <br>Ok. He said, "This is the power, this is the glory of God".
    <br>That we should start meditating upon the Word of God
    <br>as it was going to be ministered to us.
    <br>When I started with it and the evangelist was coming -
    <br>she was coming from this side, going like that -
    <br>I started feeling like I wanted to leave this place.
    <br>Even before getting closer to you?
    <br>Yes, even before she got closer to me, I felt like running away from this place.
    <br>I wanted to leave this place and go.
    <br>When she was coming closer, I was drawing back.
    <br>But when she ministered to me, that is when I felt so much fire -
    <br>like it was burning from head to toe - I couldn't even hold myself.
    <br>Immediately she ministered the Morning Water on you, you felt a huge fire all over your body?
    <br>A huge fire like that; I couldn't even look at it.
    <br>I was shaking all over.
    <br>What happened eventually?
    <br>I don't know. I sat at that side but I just came to find myself here.
    <br>All the time I was coming, I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>It was just like a huge fire that was all over me; I couldn't hold myself anymore.
    <br>So after your deliverance, what can you say?
    <br>What are the changes you have seen in your body, your dreams and your entire life?
    <br>After my deliverance, I had a dream where a woman came to me.
    <br>I was driving a brand-new car.
    <br>So she asked me for the keys.
    <br>Then I told her, "I can't give you the keys because I just bought this car".
    <br>That is how I woke up from that dream.
    <br>I sleep very well. I eat very well. I'm so very peaceful.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Apart from the dream - the victory God gave to you -
    <br>what about the issue of seeing women coming to you in your dream to sleep with you?
    <br>Do you still have such dreams?
    <br>I'm not seeing women sleeping with me in the dream.
    <br>I'm no longer eating in the dream.
    <br>I don't see people stabbing me in the dream
    <br>and I don't see people chasing me in the dream.
    <br>My dream has been peaceful from the time they ministered the Morning Water
    <br>and the time the man of God touched me.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>We can see on the left-hand side of the screen of the television -
    <br>that was exactly how the brother was declared free.
    <br>After the ministration of the New Morning Water as you can see on the screen of your television,
    <br>he was completely rescued and delivered from the hands of the devil.
    <br>And today he is hale and hearty and giving his wonderful testimony,
    <br>declaring that everything has turned new in his life.
    <br>He is completely delivered.
    <br>The Bible says that once the Son of God delivers you, you are delivered indeed.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>And right now you are delivered through the medium of the Morning Water,
    <br>what is your advice to people who are eagerly waiting for similar ministration?
    <br>They should wait for their deliverance so that they become free just like I am today.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And we pray that as you go and make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>your deliverance will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
