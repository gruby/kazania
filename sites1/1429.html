  <p>    
    <br>Praise the living Jesus Christ!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "You are welcome to the presence of God."
    <br>Say it with joy, say, "You are welcome to the presence of God."
    <br>I can't hear you. Say, "You are welcome to the presence of God."
    <br>In His presence there is fullness of joy.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Say, "I am in the presence of God because God has the answer to my problem."
    <br>Do you believe God has the answer to your problem?
    <br>If you believe He has the answer, say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Once again, you are welcome to the presence of God.
    <br>As you all know, my name is Yinka.
    <br>Today I want to begin by asking you few questions.
    <br>Have you ever asked yourself why it is difficult for people to get back up each time they fall?
    <br>Have you ever asked yourself why people keep wallowing in their self-pity?
    <br>Have you ever asked yourself why the cycle of life keeps going on without a change?
    <br>I believe you will discover the answer to these questions in this message, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Today many people complain about the unkindness of people around them
    <br>instead of reflecting on life itself.
    <br>They justify their wrongdoing and point fingers at their fellow brothers
    <br>as being the cause of their predicament,
    <br>their troubles, failure, disappointment and broken homes.
    <br>This reminds me of a story, and I want you to listen.
    <br>There were convicts in a certain city.
    <br>One day the judge came into their midst and began to ask each of these prisoners
    <br>what had brought them into the prison.
    <br>Nearly all of them claimed innocence and blamed someone else for their situation.
    <br>Some blamed their poor family background.
    <br>Some blamed the poor economic situation.
    <br>But there was one young boy among them so different.
    <br>He said, "Sir, I deserve to be here because I have stolen. I am guilty.
    <br>In fact no one is at fault but me."
    <br>The judge was amazed about his honesty
    <br>and instructed to release the boy immediately and set him free.
    <br>Brethren, this is also true of salvation.
    <br>To have salvation is to be free from sin and its penalties.
    <br>Until a person is willing to admit that he is a sinner in need of salvation,
    <br>the Bible says that he cannot experience freedom from fear, guilt, inferiority and condemnation,
    <br>for these are four major problems that rob Christians of their blessing.
    <br>Fear, inferiority, condemnation and guilt.
    <br>Until a person is willing to admit his weaknesses, his wrongdoing,
    <br>the Bible says he cannot experience freedom.
    <br>The Bible says where there is true sorrow for sin, there will be free confession of sin to God in prayer.
    <br>Many people today are busy rebuking and binding their suspected enemies.
    <br>Where their enemies don't die or face one problem or the other,
    <br>they feel disappointed and change their church.
    <br>For the reason known to them, they move from one church to another,
    <br>instead of being around Jesus Christ, the Head of the church.
    <br>Brethren,
    <br>when you examine your life, when you reflect over your life,
    <br>you will discover the role you have played in your situation.
    <br>I may not know your situation but Jesus knows.
    <br>The principle of life says, "Nothing happens for nothing and nothing comes by chance."
    <br>This a moment of sober reflection.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This a moment of sober reflection."
    <br>This is a moment of sober reflection.
    <br>And this will bring me to the title of this message:
    <br>STOP FIGHTING THE WRONG BATTLE
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Stop fighting the wrong battle."
    <br>If you want solution to your problem, stop fighting the wrong battle.
    <br>Stop fighting the wrong battle.
    <br>Today many people oftentimes seek a temporary solution rather than a lasting one.
    <br>A lasting solution gives redemption forever.
    <br>Let us open our Bibles to the Book of Luke 18 - that is our proof text.
    <br>We want to hear what Jesus said to those who felt to be victims of their circumstances,
    <br>their troubles, their pain.
    <br>Let us open our Bibles to the Book of Luke 18 and that will be our first proof text for this message.
    <br>Let someone say, "Stop fighting the wrong battle."
    <br>The Book of Luke 18 - let's take our reading from verse 9:
    <br>"...He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous,
    <br>and despised others:
    <br>'Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
    <br>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself,
    <br>'God, I thank You that I am not like other men - extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
    <br>or even as this tax collector.
    <br>I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all I possess.'
    <br>And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven,
    <br>but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me a sinner!'
    <br>'I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other;
    <br>for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted'."
    <br>I want you to open your heart right now and say with me:
    <br>Oh Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner.
    <br>Open your heart and say, "Oh Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner."
    <br>Oh Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner.
    <br>Such is the voice that the Lord hears most clearly.
    <br>The Bible says when we exalt ourselves, we will be humbled.
    <br>Those who exalt themselves will be humbled
    <br>and therefore those who humble themselves for Christ's sake,
    <br>God will exalt them in His own time and season.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These passages of Scripture make us to understand that
    <br>God does not need our sacrifice to take away the sin or the product of sin in our lives
    <br>but that we come to repentance.
    <br>He needs our repentance -
    <br>that is not only feeling sorrow for the sin committed but breaking away from sin.
    <br>Remember, bad-natured people would cry without a thorough reformation of heart and life.
    <br>When you pray to God without a thorough reformation of heart and life,
    <br>our prayer will become a curse to us and an abomination to God.
    <br>If you ask anyone here what the cause of his or her problem is,
    <br>we may likely not find anyone who would be willing to admit or acknowledge his own role
    <br>in his situation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, it is important for us to know that our wrong attitude towards our unpleasant situation
    <br>will hinder our prayer from being effectual.
    <br>Our wrong attitude towards our unpleasant situation
    <br>will hinder our prayer from being effectual.
    <br>That is why sometimes we pray, we fast, yet no result, no answer
    <br>because we have not yet discovered the areas which we have really missed the mark.
    <br>Sinning means 'missing the mark' - God's standard -
    <br>whether consciously or unconsciously.
    <br>When you miss that standard, you miss the mark.
    <br>Reflect back, just reflect back.
    <br>The Bible says that satan rules the world through sin.
    <br>Not everything that happen to us was caused by the enemy.
    <br>This means the enemy only touches your life through sin.
    <br>The enemy only touches you through sin.
    <br>When you open the Book of 2 Corinthians 7:10, the Bible says:
    <br>Our failure to admit our wrong, to acknowledge our weakness, to acknowledge our limitation,
    <br>prevents our harmony with God, thereby creating an invisible barrier between us and God.
    <br>When people are experiencing failure in life,
    <br>no one will say it is as a result of his own negligence or laziness.
    <br>But ask any successful person - they will tell you they succeeded
    <br>as the result of their own effort.
    <br>You will hear them say, "I really worked hard, and this is why I am what I am today."
    <br>You ascribe glory to yourself.
    <br>When you are going through hard times, you begin to look for a scapegoat,
    <br>someone to blame for your misfortune instead of soul-searching to find out the real cause
    <br>which may not be far from our transgressions, our disobedience, our sin.
    <br>Let someone say, "Examine yourself."
    <br>It is true you are in the presence of God.
    <br>God has prepared a table before you but He requires you today to examine yourself
    <br>and stop fighting the wrong battle if you want to receive a lasting solution.
    <br>Many blame their sickness or generational curses.
    <br>We have seen several cases of sickness acquired through personal habits,
    <br>yet, we keep blaming generational curses.
    <br>A chain-smoker will blame his father, who used to send him to buy cigarettes
    <br>during his early years of life.
    <br>A prostitute will blame the poor family background.
    <br>Someone in a notorious business will blame the poor economic situation.
    <br>No one would be responsible.
    <br>No one would take any responsibility for his own actions.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It is time to look into my own inaction."
    <br>It is time for me to look into my own inaction.
    <br>It is time for you to look inward
    <br>to discover the areas you have really missed the mark in order to receive a lasting solution.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Are you struggling with drugs?
    <br>Are you sick?
    <br>Are you poor?
    <br>Are you rejected or isolated?
    <br>Perhaps you are homeless.
    <br>When you drill deep 'til you hit the bedrock, you will know
    <br>that you are not an innocent victim but an architect of your own fate condition.
    <br>I don't know your problem but I believe Master Jesus knows.
    <br>If you drill deep 'til you hit the bedrock, you will know
    <br>that you are not an innocent victim but an architect of your own fate condition.
    <br>Now the question is:
    <br>How do we know the children of God?
    <br>The Bible says when the children of God begin to experience the product of sin,
    <br>I mean the trouble, failure, disappointment, hardship, backwardness...
    <br>When the children of God begin to experience the product of sin,
    <br>instead of pointing accusing fingers at their fellow brothers
    <br>as being the cause of their problem, they look inwards.
    <br>They do what?
    <br>They look inwards first.
    <br>They don't start looking for father, mother, sister as the cause of the problem.
    <br>They first look inwards to rediscover their route to God.
    <br>In humility and sincerity of heart, they repent and repair.
    <br>Let someone say, "They repent and repair."
    <br>I mean, they ask for forgiveness; they pray to God.
    <br>They change their ways and pray to God for their reinstatement
    <br>and God in His infinite mercy is always ready to readmit those who come to Him
    <br>in humility, humbleness, repentance, to their rightful position in His glory.
    <br>Brethren, these are the essential characteristics of purity.
    <br>Let someone say, "I am ready to strike the root."
    <br>Say it with joy that I'm ready to strike the root of my problem.
    <br>Today I'm ready to strike the root cause of my problem and receive a lasting solution.
    <br>I am ready to strike the root of my problem and receive a lasting solution.
    <br>No one can live a perfect life without mistakes.
    <br>One thing is sure:
    <br>Whether victims or perpetrators, the Bible says we all stand in helpless need
    <br>of His divine mercy.
    <br>Whether the offended or offender, we all stand in helpless need of His divine mercy.
    <br>Ask King David, a man after God's own heart, in the Book of Psalms 51 and he will tell you
    <br>that all men fall but the great ones get back up.
    <br>King David is a man after God's own heart but his heart failed him.
    <br>Ask King David, a man after God's own heart and he will tell you
    <br>that all men fall but the great ones get back up.
    <br>Great ones are those who are always willing to admit, to acknowledge their weakness,
    <br>their limitation, their wrongs, come to repentance and move on.
    <br>Our ability to always acknowledge our weakness, wrongdoing gets us back on our feet.
    <br>Our own ability to acknowledge our weakness at all times, come to repentance,
    <br>discover the areas in which we have missed the mark gets us back on our feet.
    <br>Therefore, we must always desire, decide to always get back up each time we fall.
    <br>This message today will get you back on your feet, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>All you need to do is to acknowledge your weakness and stop fighting the wrong battle.
    <br>Repentance comes when we stop fighting the wrong battle.
    <br>Repentance comes when we stop blaming others.
    <br>Repentance comes when we stop repeating stories of those who lie against us, humiliate us,
    <br>disappoint us, hate us.
    <br>Blaming others will never stop anything.
    <br>Blaming others for your trouble will never end your crisis.
    <br>Blaming others will never solve the problem; repentance will.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Blaming others for my situation will not change anything."
    <br>Blaming someone else for my pain, failure, difficulties will not change anything;
    <br>repentance will.
    <br>Finally brethren, let's quickly go to the Bible - the Book of 2 Chronicles 7
    <br>and let us hear what Jesus has given us as the solution, the remedy to every malady.
    <br>Let us open our Bibles to the Book of 2 Chronicles 7
    <br>and let us hear what our Saviour has to say about the way out.
    <br>The Book of 2 Chronicles, after the Book of Kings; 2 Chronicles 7
    <br>and let us take our reading from verse 14.
    <br>Are you ready to hear the way out?
    <br>"If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray
    <br>and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways,
    <br>then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land."
    <br>Let someone say, "Amen!"
    <br>God has given us the condition under which our situation will be addressed.
    <br>God has given you the condition under which your situation will be addressed today.
    <br>The greatest love our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has given each and every on of us
    <br>is the opportunity to correct our mistakes.
    <br>I know there are many people who had made wrong accusations in the past
    <br>for their father, their mother, flesh and blood as being the cause of their problem.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not too late to repent and repair.
    <br>The Lord is about to take you to a place you have never lived before,
    <br>to a place you have never been before, only if you are ready right now to repent and repair.
    <br>You must always understand that there are powers that want you to be humiliated,
    <br>there are powers that want you to be isolated, condemned, rejected
    <br>in order to displace you from your position in God.
    <br>Sin is the disease of the soul but when it is struck, the soul is healed indeed.
    <br>Let us rise up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God has given us the condition.
    <br>The promise of God in the Book of 2 Chronicles 7:14 is not a blank cheque.
    <br>He clearly spells out the condition on which He makes it.
    <br>Right now open your heart and say, "Oh Lord,
    <br>be merciful to me, a sinner."
    <br>Oh Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner.
    <br>Enter my soul and put an end to those hindrances to my prayer.
    <br>Right now open your mouth and ask Jesus to put an end to those hindrances to your prayer.
    <br>Open your heart with faith, in humility and sincerity.
    <br>Open your mouth with sincerity of faith and humility of mind.
    <br>Ask Jesus to put an end to those hindrances to your prayer -
    <br>be it disobedience, unforgiveness, false accusation.
    <br>Open your mouth and ask Jesus to put an end to those hindrances to your prayer.
    <br>You are just a moment, a minute away from your restoration.
    <br>You are just a minute away from your freedom, from your healing, from your liberation.
    <br>Open your heart and ask Jesus to put an end to those hindrances to your prayer.
    <br>Ask Jesus for mercy today.
    <br>Ask Jesus Christ for mercy.
    <br>Pardoning mercy makes way for healing mercy, deliverance mercy,
    <br>freedom mercy, restoration mercy.
    <br>Ask Jesus for mercy and favour.
    <br>When His mercy speaks for you today, you will be healed,
    <br>you will be restored, you will be delivered, you will be renewed.
    <br>Open your heart and ask for His mercy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that whatever that is unwilling to yield to your prayer
    <br>will begin to yield right now, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever that is unwilling to yield to your prayer
    <br>will begin to yield today, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Since God has removed the hindrances,
    <br>whatever you say here on earth shall be said in Heaven
    <br>and whatever you loose here on earth shall be loosed in Heaven.
    <br>Right now open your heart and begin to ask for all you need in His presence.
    <br>Ask for His mercy, ask for His favour, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Ask for His healing power to rest upon you.
    <br>Ask Him to rain His healing power on you, His deliverance power on you,

    <br>Ask Jesus to rain His power of healing on you,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.

    <br>I can see God's anointing touching your life, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see God's power touching your life, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see God's anointing touching your life, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, be reinstated from sickness to good health!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, be reinstated from frustration to fulfillment!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, be reinstated from failure to success!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, be reinstated from a life of want to a life of abundance!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>The Bible says if you turn to God once, He will turn to you a million times.
    <br>I pray that this message finds a place in your heart, in Jesus' name.
