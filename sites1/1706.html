    <br>Join Emmanuel TV and T.B. Joshua as they visit the elderly.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Journey To A Rural Community For Charity Outreach To The Elderly
    <br>Join T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team on their journey to reach out in love and compassion
    <br>to the elderly in a rural community in Nigeria.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Journey To A Rural Community For Charity Outreach To The Elderly
    <br>Viewers, we should see giving to others as an assignment from God
    <br>because that only comes to God that comes from Him.
    <br>Whatever blessing God has given us is meant to be replanted for a bigger harvest.
    <br>Let us give for God's sake and receive more of whatever we give.
    <br>Help for God's sake and be helped.
    <br>Love for God's sake and be loved.
    <br>Care for God's sake and be cared for.
    <br>I want to take you to the Book of Romans 12 - let's quickly look at verse 8 there:
    <br>"If it is to encourage, then give encouragement;
    <br>if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently;
    <br>if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully."
    <br>Jesus values the little effort.
    <br>No matter how small or little, Jesus values it when it is done in truth, humility and faith.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever is in your hand now
    <br>is a solution to someone else in need.
    <br>My head my shoulders
    <br>My knees my toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
    <br>Finally, viewers, this does not mean that your love for the needy, your care for the needy,
    <br>your blessing for the needy are enough to bring you to salvation
    <br>but it forms the basis for judging your level.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>A very old gentleman lies on a bed in a home T.B. Joshua enters.
    <br>He rises with help to greet the man of God.
    <br>I have come to greet you, sir. I am T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is for you; it is 100,000 naira.
    <br>Elderly Man Receives Financial Support From T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>Is this the money?
    <br>Elderly Man Receives Financial Support From T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>Wow! Thank you!
    <br>I greet you, sir.
    <br>It pleases God in His mercy to bless you with long life.
    <br>I am here to celebrate the New Year with you.
    <br>God will be with you.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>If I start telling you what I have experienced...
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>Do you know your age now?
    <br>I cannot say it accurately.
    <br>Do you understand me, sir?
    <br>This is because they did not write the date down.
    <br>But to me, as at now, I am between 150 years old and above.
    <br>We thank God Almighty who has blessed you with long life
    <br>and has made it possible for you to live above 150 years.
    <br>I am above 150 years.
    <br>All glory to God!
    <br>Compliments of the season.
    <br>I am here to greet you. I am T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Is there any other person from outside here?
    <br>No.
    <br>T.B. Joshua is here.
    <br>- Please, sir.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Where is your hand?
    <br>- This is my hand.
    <br>Can you help me, sir?
    <br>Raise my mattress; raise it up.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Raise it very well.
    <br>I want to put this there.
    <br>OK, you want to put the money there.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>Are you OK, sir?
    <br>A little more, sir.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>What an incredible grace to live to see 150 years.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>- Hi. How are you?
    <br>- Fine, sir.
    <br>It is the grace of God to grow old.
    <br>It is also the grace of God to be in a position to care.
    <br>We are called to give the greater care, love and support than we were given,
    <br>when we were too young to care for ourselves.
    <br>This is the grace of God.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>We rejoice with you for the long life God has given you.
    <br>It pleases God in His mercy to bless you with long life.
    <br>It is His joy to give you this long life.
    <br>I am T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is 100,000 naira for you; I want to give it to you myself.
    <br>God will hold you steadfastly to the end.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>He will not allow your foot to slip.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>- I came to celebrate with you.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>I said to myself that I must visit and celebrate with those whom God has given long life.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>God will empower you the more.
    <br>- You will go out and come back in peace.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>- You will not know sorrow.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>- No one will take your blessing from you.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>I will come back to see you.
    <br>Make sure you use this to take care of mama.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Compliments of the season.
    <br>As T.B. Joshua makes his way to another home in the community,
    <br>let us follow and meet the elderly gentleman inside.

    <br>It is me, T.B. Joshua.
    <br>- I made time to come and see you.
    <br>- Thank you, sir.
    <br>When I see all the people who have been receiving gifts,
    <br>you are one of the oldest among them.
    <br>I see that you are very old; it is the will of God to give you this long life.
    <br>- I came to rejoice with you.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>Compliments of the season.
    <br>- I want to give you this 100,000 naira.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>- From the Lord, this is 100,000 naira.
    <br>- Wow! Thank You, God!
    <br>Thank you for what you have given me.
    <br>- You will conquer all evil.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>You will overcome. You will not lose the Kingdom of God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>Where are your elderly ones?
    <br>Care for them and you shall reach old age.
    <br>As the Bible instructs:
    <br>We demonstrate our love for God by loving our neighbour.
    <br>Your neighbour can be older or younger than you - love them all.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>It shall be well with you till the end of your days.
    <br>It shall be well with you.
    <br>I pray for you all the time that you will lead us to Heaven.
    <br>This is your picture.
    <br>It shall be well with you till the end of your days by the grace of God.
    <br>You are our leader and you shall lead us to Heaven.
    <br>You shall be filled with joy.
    <br>The heart of the matter is you will lead us to Heaven by the grace of God.
    <br>What I'm concerned about is the youth; please pray for them.
    <br>I feel sorry for the youth.
    <br>I feel so sorry for them because of what is happening now.
    <br>The Bible says in the end times...
    <br>Please, sit down!
    <br>No, I'm OK like this.
    <br>What was said about the end times is happening now.
    <br>God will strengthen you.
    <br>Jesus is coming soon!
    <br>Those that hold on to Christ Jesus, He shall meet them in peace.
    <br>When I learnt about your age, I said I must come and rejoice with you.
    <br>I am surprised myself that God has kept me till this age!
    <br>It is God's blessing for you to reach this old age.
    <br>From my young age I prayed; God strengthened me and He kept me till this day.
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>127 years old.
    <br>God has blessed you with long life.
    <br>This is your child; she also wants to greet you.
    <br>It shall be well with you till the end.
    <br>You will not face disgrace. You shall grow old.
    <br>It shall be well with you till the end.
    <br>We want to give you this 100,000 naira.
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Just for me!
    <br>I have asked that they should constantly visit and take care of you.
    <br>Elderly Man Receives Financial Support From T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I am grateful.
    <br>It shall be well with you and you will not face disgrace.
    <br>You shall continue to do good.
    <br>It shall be well with you.
    <br>It shall be well with you till the end of your days.
    <br>You will not face disgrace. You will continue to do good.
    <br>Oh Lord, let it be well with the youth.
    <br>Don't let them be disgraced.
    <br>Oh Lord, You said You shall come suddenly and repay everyone for what they have done.
    <br>Lord, we want You to uphold the youth and protect them.
    <br>They are the leaders of tomorrow.
    <br>From ages past, it has been written in the Bible that children will not listen to their fathers.
    <br>Listen to your father and mother.
    <br>God will prosper you.
    <br>You shall prosper and it shall be well with you till the end of your days.
    <br>All the bad news I have been hearing on the radio is so frightening.
    <br>As for Christians, it shall be well with them.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Your life will be meaningful and it shall be well with you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You shall not lack honour and integrity in your old age.
    <br>It shall be well with you till the end of your days.
    <br>You should constantly visit baba and take care of him.
    <br>It is not a crime to be old but the way we go about it today.
    <br>We need to take care of baba.
    <br>Just for me!
    <br>It shall be well with you till the end of your days, by the grace of God.
    <br>It shall be well with you.
    <br>You shall not face disgrace.
    <br>Well done.
    <br>Wow!
    <br>It shall be well with you.
    <br>It is the same T.B. Joshua you have been praying for that has just come to visit you.
    <br>I have been praying for him without ceasing.
    <br>I have prayed for him today.
    <br>I pray for him three times a day.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>Why is mama here?
    <br>She lacks care.
    <br>I want to be on my knees.
    <br>- You said mama has no care.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>So, no one is taking care of you?
    <br>Yes, I'm even sick.
    <br>I don't have any children.
    <br>How old are you now?
    <br>See, my hair has turned grey.
    <br>- What is her age?
    <br>- 150.
    <br>The only child I had died.
    <br>Her name was Kudi.
    <br>I have come to greet you. My name is T.B. Joshua - your son from Lagos.
    <br>When I was told about those who received gifts,
    <br>I realised that you were very old and felt I had to make time to come and greet you
    <br>and congratulate you on reaching this age.
    <br>Congratulations for the New Year!
    <br>I have this gift of 200,000 naira for you.
    <br>- Who is taking care of mama now?
    <br>- My younger brother.
    <br>- You will have a safe journey back home.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>You will not be remembered in the day of sadness.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>The day they are sharing good health and happiness, you will be on the high table.
    <br>You will eat the fruit of your labour.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>One Of The Oldest People In The Community Sings A Song Of Blessing For T.B. Joshua
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>I said the person that brought this gift will eat the fruit of his labour.
    <br>God will enrich him. I said, in the day of sadness he will not be remembered.
    <br>The day God is sharing blessing, favour, he will be remembered.
    <br>God will be against anyone who is against him.
    <br>God will be merciful to anyone who is merciful towards him.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We love you.

    <br>T.B. Joshua Pays A Special Visit To The Homes Of The Oldest People In The Community
    <br>My name is Ojo.
    <br>My age is...
    <br>It's been a long time.
    <br>Congratulations on your long life.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Can we say this is what the Bible means by faith without works is dead; I mean, watch and pray?
    <br>Viewers, we should see giving to others as an assignment from God
    <br>because that only comes to God that comes from Him.
    <br>Whatever blessing God has given us is meant to be replanted for a bigger harvest.
    <br>Let us give for God's sake and receive more of whatever we give.
    <br>Help for God's sake and be helped.
    <br>Love for God's sake and be loved.
    <br>Care for God's sake and be cared for.
    <br>I want to take you to the Book of Romans 12 - let's quickly look at verse 8 there:
    <br>"If it is to encourage, then give encouragement;
    <br>if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently;
    <br>if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully."
    <br>Jesus values the little effort.
    <br>No matter how small or little, Jesus values it when it is done in truth, humility and faith.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever is in your hand now
    <br>is a solution to someone else in need.
    <br>My head my shoulders
    <br>My knees my toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
