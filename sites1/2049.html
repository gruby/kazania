    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>My name is Miguelina Alonso and I come from The Dominican Republic.
    <br>I suffered from polyneuropathy.
    <br>It damaged my nervous system and it affected both my arms and legs.
    <br>For two years I visited different specialists. All the treatments I received didn't provide any solution.
    <br>I depended on a wheelchair, a walking stick and needed assistance to do any activity.
    <br>I had no life because I spent most of my time going for medical appointments.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>My legs were swollen. I was in a lot of pain.
    <br>My nervous system felt like it had short-circuited; the pain would move from my arms to my legs.
    <br>It left me completely disabled.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>For me, it was a a really unexpected sensation.
    <br>After two years without hope or results, I can now walk by myself!
    <br>I am without pain!
    <br>It was definitely a work done by God for His glory.
    <br>After Prophet TB Joshua prayed for me, I felt a hot sensation in my left leg.
    <br>Can you show us what you couldn't do before?
    <br>Healed Of Inability To Walk
    <br>No Longer Using A Wheelchair
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With Prophet TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I am highly grateful to God for making my life a testimony for His glory.
    <br>After this experience, I want to give myself completely to the Lord
    <br>because I understand that it is only through Him we can be healed and delivered.
    <br>What else can I say to let the world know that Jesus is the only Lord and Saviour!
