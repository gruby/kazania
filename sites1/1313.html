  <p>    
    <br>There is a bad spirit in your family.
    <br>You are correct, man of God.
    <br>Even one of your... became a thief.
    <br>You are right, man of God.
    <br>Simple. It's that spirit of stealing.
    <br>Help me, man of God!
    <br>There is a child you are having problems with now.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>He has begun to show that sign that, "This spirit is in me."
    <br>You are true, man of God.
    <br>I want to see you.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>If you overcome that spirit, your children will not; that spirit has entered the family.
    <br>They killed two people in the family over the issue of 'thief - stealing.'
    <br>Help me, man of God!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Mr Sunday Nwumah.
    <br>Here is my lovely wife.
    <br>Here is my younger brother.
    <br>And the boy the man of God was talking about is here and that is the mother.
    <br>Have you asked him about the spirit that I said is in your family?
    <br>Really, I have asked him, man of God.
    <br>Go and meet him.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son
    <br>Yes. It's true.
    <br>I have the spirit of armed robber.
    <br>How?
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>I was maltreated by my uncle. That is when I started to commit crime.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>Because I didn't know my father.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>One day, my mother came to pick me up to bring me to the Republic of Benin.
    <br>She presented me to my father nine years ago. I had never known him.
    <br>Two days ago was the first time my father came to pick me up.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>When we were in the car, he asked me some questions.
    <br>He asked me, if I had the spirit of stealing.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>He said, okay and that I would travel with him.
    <br>That is how I came here and I don't know what will happen to me from here.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>I used to steal food.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>Because I didn't have food to eat. 
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>I was forced to steal.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>Before people would give me food, they would ask me who would pay, whether my mother or father.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophesy Confirmation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It's more than stealing. He has blood in his hands.
    <br>After the meeting we will see because it's a strange spirit that entered the family.
    <br>The father may not know.
    <br>That spirit has entered the family already.
    <br>And it's not issue that just started from him.
    <br>So, I think I need to see the family, so after the meeting I will see them.
    <br>So thank you. Any other message from the father?
    <br>Man of God, please help me. This boy - I have never accepted him as my son 
    <br>because of how the issue happened.
    <br>Last 24 years...
    <br>Look, I say, in your family, there is a curse.
    <br>Not even only you. Even this your brother here, he had a similar problem.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Of course, man of God, you are true.
    <br>Giving birth and denying it.
    <br>It's real, man of God.
    <br>Shall will call those children a bastard in the family?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, I will see the family altogether, I will meet them. Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prayed with and counselled Mr Sunday Nwumah
    <br>and his family and reconciled him with his son.
    <br>Let us hear from them.
    <br>Some years ago - 23 years ago precisely - in Amakara, the  Republic of Togo
    <br>I had contact with a lady at that time -  the lady who is at that end.
    <br>After having an affair with her, we lost contact for that time.
    <br>I didn't know her whereabouts.
    <br>I didn't know she became pregnant by me until 8-9 months after she delivered.
    <br>One day, some of my people who travelled to that area
    <br>came back and were congratulating me, telling me she had a baby boy for me.
    <br>I said, "What? What child?"
    <br>I said, "Okay". I did not say anything.
    <br>I went there because of fear.
    <br>That time, I had a fear that maybe I would have a problem with the Togolese there
    <br>for impregnating her and having a child I didn't know.
    <br>Because of the fear I had in me at that time, I was forced to go and legalize the birth.
    <br>The birth certificate of this boy at that time, I obtained it
    <br>and signed all the papers that were given to me.
    <br>After that, we lost contact.
    <br>I didn't see them anymore for many years.
    <br>My wife didn't have any idea that I had a child outside the matrimonial home.
    <br>She did not know.
    <br>The only thing I told her was just to come.
    <br>After I told my wife that this is what happened some years ago,
    <br>I had forgotten everything about the issue of the child.
    <br>So you basically rejected the child as your son. You had not taken up any responsibility for him.
    <br>Actually, I had forgotten everything about the child.
    <br>I was no more thinking of anything like that
    <br>until three Sundays ago when I had the opportunity to be in the service,
    <br>when the man of God reached me and prophesied to me
    <br>that there was a child I was having problems with.
    <br>I was confused because that was not the problem that brought me here.
    <br>I was actually confused.
    <br>I went back and after everything, the man of God gave me money to go and look for the child.
    <br>It took me a lot of time, almost two weeks, to get him.
    <br>You know, when a message is sent from God, the Spirit of God is always with you.
    <br>Then, the Spirit of God accompanied me to a distance area I have never been in my life.
    <br>I was surprised about the place where I found this boy.
    <br>I found out that his condition wasn't comfortable at all.
    <br>The condition I found  him in was very critical.
    <br>This is where we are today and here is the child the man of God was prophesying about.
    <br>His name is Chidozie and he is with us today.
    <br>When I met the man of God - in short, he is an extraordinary man.
    <br>I have been watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I have been seeing numerous things that have been happening.
    <br>But today, in short, my life had changed because of this testimony.
    <br>He told me that I should accept the child as my son and bring him back to my family
    <br>and train him by myself in order to change his life for good and forever.
    <br>That is what I am going to do.
    <br>I will respect each and every word of the man of God.
    <br>I am using this opportunity to tell him that I am very sorry for what had happened,
    <br>for overlooking him and not taking care of him all these years.
    <br>Chidozie, I am very sorry, my son.
    <br>I have taken you as my son and I am going to be with you.
    <br>I am going to respect everything the man of God has said.
    <br>You will be with me and I will train you to the best to the glory of God.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Son 
    <br>Reconciled After 24 Years
    <br>Thank you, Jesus Christ. That is as the result of instruction of the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You see father and son reconciled after 24 years of separation through the prophetic message
    <br>God has given to Prophet T.B. Joshua and we give all the glory to God.
    <br>The Bible says, "When the Son of God sets you free, you are free indeed."
    <br>This word of prophecy has brought very big breakthrough in my family.
    <br>I believe that our past is over from today, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I was living a bad life before coming here.
    <br>When I came here, God delivered me and I thank Him.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I used to steal and move with bad friends. I would sleep anywhere.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Many of my friends are in prison but I was saved.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I am very happy and I thank my father for finding me.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Yesterday, I slept very well - no nightmares; before  I slept, I prayed.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My name is Ifeoma Sunday Nwumah.
    <br>I thank God for using the man of God to break every curse in our family
    <br>in Jesus' name because I know the past is over.
    <br>I have received him whole heatedly. I know that he is my son now.
    <br>I will train him in the ways of God as Prophet T.B. Joshua has already said that
    <br>I should take him as my son and I will give him a good training in Jesus' name.
    <br>I know that the Lord will be my strength.
    <br>I will embrace him as my son.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Thank you, Jesus! That's wonderful. Thank you very much, madam.
    <br>So we have heard from madam. She has taken him as her son to the glory of God.
    <br>This is a reconciliation that only Jesus Christ can bring and we give all the glory to God.
    <br>I am the younger brother of Mr Sunday Nwumah.
    <br>The lady beside me is my wife.
    <br>The prophecy of the man of God about the child controversy in our family brought a curse
    <br>and a lot of destruction in our family - I see it as the truth.
    <br>I also have the problem of child controversy which is true.
    <br>Sixteen years ago, I had a relationship with the woman that is standing there
    <br>and she had a daughter before I left them. It was in  Benin Republic before I left for Nigeria.
    <br>For 16 years, I had not seen her until that Sunday, when we came here.
    <br>So for 16 years you had not seen your daughter that you had with a lady in Benin Republic?
    <br>But last week on Sunday when the man of God gave the prophecy; you mean that on that Sunday
    <br>you saw your daughter for the first time?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I saw her but didn't even recognise her. I asked my sister, "Is this Ngozi?" She replied , "Yes."
    <br>I said, "Glory be to God!"
    <br>This is the Ngozi I'm referring to.
    <br>You mean to say this is your daughter that you rejected for 16 years, you met her for the first time here
    <br>in the SCOAN?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What can you say to the glory of God, sir?
    <br>I can say, glory be to God that the man of of God revealed this
    <br>and I believe that all the other problems are over.
    <br>We are going to put the past behind us.
    <br>I will do my possible best to take care of her.
    <br>Mr Nwumah United With Daughter After 16 Years Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I accept her  back as my daughter.
    <br>Mr Nwumah United With Daughter After 16 Years Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Thank you, Jesus Christ. We give glory to God. This is a double reconciliation in this family to the glory of God
    <br>and we give all the glory to Jesus Christ.
    <br>I thank God Almighty for bringing me here to know my father.
    <br>It has been more than 14 years and I never knew him.
    <br>So I am very  happy and I thank God.
    <br>Ngozi & Father
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>I thank God so much for a day like this.
    <br>God Almighty has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to put an end to every problem we had in our family.
    <br>I have known for about 16 years that he had a child outside our marriage but I had not seen her.
    <br>I thank God that today I have seen her and I am happy to have another daughter.
    <br>Mr Nwumah's Wife United To His Daughter 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>What I want to say is that I thank God that my child has come to see his father
    <br>and that he is now in the hands of his father. Now I'm proud.
    <br>I thank God for the deliverance he has received.
    <br>Mother of Mr Sunday Nwumah's Son 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I want to thank God for what He has done
    <br>because my daughter now knows her father after 15 years.
    <br>Mother of Ngozi 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>You are happy now that her father will now be able to take care her and support you in taking care of her?
    <br>Mother of Ngozi 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I am happy because I took care of her alone, I paid her scholarship - CFA 90,000 per year
    <br>without the help of anybody else.
    <br>So, if he can take up his responsibility and help me so that the responsibility will not be on me alone,
    <br>I would be happy.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family  
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Amen! Thank you, Jesus and we know that this reconciliation will open the door for a big breakthrough
    <br>and everything that has to do with this family.
    <br>So now to crown up everything, the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua said that he wants to support this family
    <br>in every way physically, spiritually, financially in every area and we know
    <br>that the family is going back with a very big testimony since the root cause of their problems has been exposed
    <br>in this word of prophecy.
    <br>So we here to present on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>the sum of N150,000 which is for this family
    <br>to start a wonderful new life with their new children that were accepted back into their family in Jesus' name.
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family Receive N150,000 From T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>I give God all the glory. I thank God for everything the man of God has been doing in our lives.
    <br>He has taken care of us ever since we have been here - more than four days.
    <br>He has given us everything including food and money.
    <br>I didn't even expect this, I give God the glory.
    <br>I thank the man of  God.
    <br>I thank Amighty God for blessing such a man for our generation.
    <br>May Almighty God bless him in his going out and coming in.
    <br>Whatever thing he lays his hand on must prosper in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I know that this money will go a long way in this reconciliation he has brought to our family.
    <br>We thank him and we glorify the name of the Lord.
    <br>Amen! Thank you, Jesus Christ! We thank God Almighty for what He has done in the life of this family.
    <br>Once again, we want to encourage everyone that you must continue to stay close to Jesus.
    <br>And we know you are coming back with more wonderful testimonies in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Mr Sunday Nwumah & Family Receive N150,000 From T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners
