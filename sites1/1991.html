  <p>    
    <br>There is a lady there; you put on white, a white gown.
    <br>Please come out because I don't want you to go back to the life you live.
    <br>You live a kind of funny life; you are there.
    <br>The woman whom the prophecy concerned comes forward from the crowd,
    <br>dressed in a white gown, just as the prophet had said.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The life you live is purely prostitute.
    <br>This is why I call her; I don't want her to go back to that life.
    <br>What a beautiful woman.
    <br>Man of God, what you said about me is true.
    <br>I have been a prostitute for the past 17 years.
    <br>I am coming from the hotel.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I want to destroy this girl.
    <br>I made her a prostitute.
    <br>For 17 years.
    <br>Any man that comes her way - I will make the man poor.
    <br>Then she will go back to prostitution.
    <br>She is free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>OK.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Assume she was not fetched out, after closing hours, she would go back.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ - she is free.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ameze Shobafo.
    <br>I come from Edo State but I stay in Cotonou.
    <br>I had been doing prostitution for 17 years.
    <br>When I was young, my father introduced me to a man who was older than me
    <br>and I had two children for that man.
    <br>One day, my sister came and I told her that I was not happy with my marriage.
    <br>She said she would take me to Cotonou.
    <br>So, I ran away to Cotonou with my senior sister.
    <br>I lived in a hotel there and was doing prostitution.
    <br>I did prostitution there for 17 years.
    <br>I came here last week Sunday to look for more men.
    <br>I was here last week and I never knew that the man of God would locate me like this.
    <br>When she came to The SCOAN last week, her intention was to look for more men - is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you just tell us; during these 17 years - how did this spirit destroy your life?
    <br>The spirit destroyed my life because I was doing prostitution for 17 years and going to clubs.
    <br>I went from hotel to hotel and would sometimes sleep with 17 to 20 men in a day.
    <br>This spirit really disturbed my life - I had no relationships; I couldn't sleep at night
    <br>and even in my dreams, I was enjoying sex, sleeping with 7 to 10 men.
    <br>That was what the spirit was doing with my life.
    <br>Sometimes, I would ask myself if this was a real business.
    <br>Sometimes, I slept with seven men in one day.
    <br>Back then, I would think that what I was doing was not good or maybe it was just life.
    <br>I couldn't sleep at night or if I did, I would dream that I was in a river swimming with some people.
    <br>Can you tell us, when you came here last week, what happened?
    <br>I was here last week and I sat down over there
    <br>when the man of God gave a prophecy that there is a lady here.
    <br>When I wanted to come out, something would tell me that it was not me
    <br>and that I should not come out and then I would go back to my seat.
    <br>I would later think that the man of God had forgotten
    <br>but after a while, he would mention the case.
    <br>When I wanted to come out, something would talk to me that I should not come out.
    <br>Finally, I didn't know what pushed me out and I told the man of God that it was me.
    <br>The man of God said that I was into prostitution and that I was a beautiful woman
    <br>but there was a spirit.
    <br>He also said that if I was not delivered, I would go back into prostitution.
    <br>So, the man of God delivered me last week Sunday.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CATCHES LADY LOOKING FOR MEN IN CHURCH!!! ðŸ¤­
    <br>We are truly under God's eyes.
    <br>You said you actually came last week with the intention of looking for more clients, men,
    <br>but God Almighty located you, through a message of prophecy and you were delivered.
    <br>- Is that right?
    <br>- Yes, I was delivered.
    <br>How did you feel when the man of God mentioned your case?
    <br>I was surprised because I did not come for that.
    <br>I was very surprised when the man of God mentioned my case.
    <br>I did not know that God still loved me, despite all my sins.
    <br>Thank God. She said she never knew that God still loved her upon all her sin.
    <br>We know that when we make mistakes, we should run to God, not run away from Him.
    <br>Madam, we want to hear from you; since your deliverance last week,
    <br>what have been the changes in your life?
    <br>The changes are that those dreams I had and not being able to sleep at night are gone.
    <br>I can sleep like a baby now.
    <br>All those man that used to call me, even recently two of them called me
    <br>but I told them not to call me anymore.
    <br>I have give my life to Jesus; you too give your life to Jesus.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CATCHES LADY LOOKING FOR MEN IN CHURCH!!! ðŸ¤­
    <br>Does this mean you don't have the urge in you to do prostitution anymore?
    <br>I don't have the urge for any man anymore
    <br>because I have realised that this business is a bad one and a sin before God.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Who is Jesus Christ to you now?
    <br>Jesus Christ is my Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>We know that life's most important decision is what you do with Jesus Christ.
    <br>And life's second most important decision is to follow His leading daily.
    <br>We want to pray and we believe with you that you will continue to follow Christ' leading,
    <br>to stay close to Him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Before that, we want to listen to your advice.
    <br>We know many people all over the world are still afflicted with this spirit
    <br>and they keep trying to stop this kind of life and they cannot.
    <br>How would you advise them?
    <br>People want to learn from you.
    <br>My advice for people out there who are still doing this prostitution is: please come to Jesus.
    <br>You cannot stop it on your own. It is not easy. You cannot stop it.
    <br>Come to Jesus; it is only Jesus that can deliver you from prostitution.
    <br>Please, come to Jesus. The way Jesus delivered me, He will also deliver you too.
