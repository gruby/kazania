    <br>Can a real Christian contract a sickness?
    <br>QUESTION - TB Joshua, can a real Christian contract a sickness?
    <br>I am asking this because I have read on the internet that true Christians cannot contract it.
    <br>I know many people are worried about this because there are many people they know
    <br>as Christians and pastors who have contracted the sickness and some have even died.
    <br>I am worried about this, whether they are Christians or not.
    <br>ANSWER - Capital YES!
    <br>Christians, do not make the mistake of thinking that you are 'out of touch'.
    <br>God often uses anything to preserve us and to strengthen our desire and determination for God.
    <br>Whatever your situation as a believer, it is all for your obedience to God (Hebrews 5:8).
    <br>A Christian can contract a virus, it is just like any other affliction.
    <br>A Christian can be sick in body and yet be a friend of God or a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>Don't let your situation mislead you and cause you to start doubting  your Guard.
    <br>That should be the reason to look deeper, pray the more and dream of other ways you might have ignored.
    <br>Do not measure your Christian life by your situation.
    <br>The rich should not concentrate on their pain or riches
    <br>and the poor should not concentrate on their pain or poverty
    <br>because a man may be afflicted or poor and yet be a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>As a Christian, what you see as sickness or affliction - God may sometimes allow it as a trial.
    <br>Oftentimes, we run from the very things that will bring strength to our lives
    <br>such as trials, affliction of any kind, all of which are meant for our spiritual benefit.
    <br>They are to test your maturity.
    <br>A true Christian is tested by his ability to face situations and deal with difficulties.
    <br>Take note: As a Christian, if you contract a virus, don't begin to misjudge yourself by worrying,
    <br>'Am I really a Christian? Why me of all this? Why me of all that?'
    <br>As a Christian, you are not out of touch.
    <br>Don't worry about whatever people say.
    <br>If you truly are a Christian, God wants you to pray the more and know what He wants you to know
    <br>because what we see as a disadvantage in our lives can be turned into an advantage.
    <br>God is still say something!
