  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>It is time for Mass Prayer.
    <br>I want to remind you of the words 'lose control' which we mentioned earlier on.
    <br>Satan causes us to lose control and commit shameful acts.
    <br>We shall take our prayer point from this.
    <br>Take this reading about Apostle Paul: Romans 7 verse 15.
    <br>"I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do."
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>When you get home, take your time to read. I will give you many other verses
    <br>that satan causes us to lose control and commit shameful acts.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>This is Apostle Paul now.
    <br>That is, Romans 7. Take your reading from verse 15.
    <br>"I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do."
    <br>Are you ok?
    <br>Yes. "For what I hate I do".
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>"For what I hate I do".
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This confirms what we said in the morning.
    <br>From what Paul the Apostle said,
    <br>satan causes us to lose control.
    <br>When you lose control, automatically you become his disciple, an errand boy, his servant.
    <br>Paul said that what he wanted to do he did not do,
    <br>but what he hated he did.
    <br>That is, out of his senses.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to ask satan to lose his grip in your life,
    <br>so that you have the right to do what is right.
    <br>Open your lips right now.
    <br>You, satan, lose your grip, in the name of Jesus! Prayer.
    <br>ANOINTED PRAYER WITH INSTANT RESULT!
