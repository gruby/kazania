  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I love you so much.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests
    <br>If not because of time, I would have given you a handshake and a kiss.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests
    <br>I can do that by faith. Are you ready to receive it by faith?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I want to appreciate your coming here today.
    <br>Thank you very much for coming.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests
    <br>I am here to let you know that I want to renew my relationship and my friendship with you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests
    <br>I mean, I want to improve in my relationship with you.
    <br>You are my best friends.
    <br>I want you to know that everything you have as a Christian came from God
    <br>and everything you will receive in the future will come from God.
    <br>If that is the case, giving is the beginning of blessing.
    <br>So, when I give you, I am giving to myself.
    <br>When I am giving you, don't say, "Thank you", because I am reshaping my own destiny.
    <br>It's like you are helping me.
    <br>If I am giving you and you receive it, you are the one helping me.
    <br>I don't know why you love me.
    <br>When I give you and you receive it, you are helping me.
    <br>I don't know why you love me.
    <br>You left your houses all the way from different states and came here.
    <br>It is more blessed to give than to receive.
    <br>Love and be loved.
    <br>Be kind and receive kindness.
    <br>Show mercy and receive mercy.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We are going to give each of you two bags of rice.
    <br>And we are giving each person N5,000.
    <br>The grand total is twenty million, three hundred and some thousands.
    <br>We will pay for your transport.
    <br>The 5,000 naira is your own money. Transport - we are going to pay it.
    <br>We have discussed it with the driver who brought you.
    <br>Next meeting, I will spoil you.
    <br>These are wheelchairs for you.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I want to sing for you.
    <br>Do you want to sing for me? Ok, sing for me.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, we love you forever
    <br>Amen! In the place of T.B. Joshua -
    <br>Jesus Christ, we love You forever
    <br>Clap for her!
    <br>Ok, sing.
    <br>We have a father
    <br>A very very handsome father
    <br>Oh how he loves us
    <br>We now know why we always smile
    <br>Oh how he loves us
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physically Challenged Guests
    <br>Do you want to sing?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests
    <br>I want to sing.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Invites His Physcially Challenged Guests
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>After spending quality time with the physically challenged,
    <br>who have come to The SCOAN
    <br>it is time for the gifts to be distributed into their midst.
    <br>You can see the large array of wheelchairs, kindly provided by Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide
    <br>which will shortly be given out to people in dire need.
    <br>In addition to the wheelchairs, each and every physically challenged guest to The SCOAN
    <br>will be leaving with two bags of rice and the sum of 5,000 naira,
    <br>aside from their various transporation costs from their respective states and countries.
    <br>Here is the huge mountain of rice that will soon be freely given
    <br>to those present at this wonderful gathering.
    <br>Remember, God has no hands but our hands to reach out to a troubled world
    <br>with His love, compassion and generosity.
    <br>This lady painfully walks forward, assisted only by a stick despite her extreme physical disability.
    <br>She is assisted to sit in her brand-new wheelchair.
    <br>You can only imagine how much of relief this will be for her
    <br>and how much easier and less stressful her daily movement will now be,
    <br>especially since she is carrying a young baby.
    <br>Physically Challenged Guests Assisted Into Their New Wheelchairs
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>When we give, we receive more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us
    <br>Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Those with extremely inhibiting physical challenges make their way forward
    <br>to receive their brand-new wheelchairs, courtesy of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world.
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>Consider the stress and the hardship they must face on a daily basis,
    <br>just trying to move around the busy streets of Lagos or whichever state they are coming from.
    <br>These are just a few out of the thousands of physically challenged people
    <br>who have been blessed with wheelchairs, food items and cash gifts since the start of The SCOAN.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "Whatever we receive from the ministry, must go back into the ministry of giving
    <br>to raise the standards of people's living, to give hope to the hopeless and help to the helpless.
    <br>When we give, we receive more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us
    <br>Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>When we give, we receive more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us
    <br>Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love
    <br>Those given wheelchairs on this particular occasion wave their hands in gratitude
    <br>and appreciation to God as the charitable activities continue.
    <br>As you see the conditions of those coming forward to receive this life-changing gift,
    <br>let this be an encouragement and also a challenge to you.
    <br>There are many people with similar situations in your own community, in your own environment.
    <br>Looking the other way when you see them in trouble is equal to rejecting Christ Himself.
    <br>It is now time for the distribution of the rice and cash gifts.
    <br>The first set of people given are those who have just received their brand-new wheelchairs.
    <br>...more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give, we are planting...
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "The value of money is not to store up properties or possessions.
    <br>The value of money is to change lives, change nations and change the world".
    <br>Many of these people came in hopeless and desperate situations.
    <br>But they are leaving with a renewed sense of hope and purpose in life,
    <br>knowing that God has not forsaken or forgotten them.
    <br>What can you do with what God has given to you to reach out to them?
    <br>One thing is clear: No one is created without a gift.
    <br>And each gift is meant to meet a need.
    <br>Find them.
    <br>...relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>When we give, we receive more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us
    <br>Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>When we give, we receive more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us
    <br>Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love
    <br>After receiving their gifts, the Emmanuel TV Team proceeds to assist them to leave the venue.
    <br>Every single physically challenged person who came to The SCOAN on this glorious occasion
    <br>left with a wonderful blessing and the knowledge that their physical disability
    <br>did not stop them from being a friend of God.
    <br>Their pockets were replenished, their hearts enlightened and their hopes revitalised.
    <br>As they leave with smiles and joy, radiating in their countenance,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV Team followed them carrying their two bags of rice.
    <br>Remember, as a Christian, your life is a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>You should build your Christian life around this principle,
    <br>knowing that we serve God when we help our fellow brothers.
    <br>Our position in Christ Jesus is enhanced each time we help someone in trouble.
    <br>This is what our Lord Jesus Christ meant when He said in Matthew 25, from verse 40 to 45,
    <br>"Whatsoever you do or you fail to do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me".
    <br>In other words, Jesus was saying here, "I have no farm where I expect you to work for me.
    <br>Or an office where I expect you to help me in checking files.
    <br>My farm and my office are your fellow brothers.
    <br>Whatever problem you help them to solve, that you do unto me".
    <br>...mutual faith, mutual love
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>When we give, we receive more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us
    <br>Every true friendship in Christ Jesus...
    <br>My name is Miss Patricia Malcolm from Kwara State (Nigeria).
    <br>We are here because the man of God invited us again.
    <br>He showered us with a lot of love.
    <br>He showed us love - the love of Christ, he is expressing it to us once again.
    <br>I pray that God will continue to bless him and love him too, the way he loves us.
    <br>I am so happy today because the hospitality was so great.
    <br>We were treated well by the man of God
    <br>We have been shown love.
    <br>By giving us food and drink, we are so happy.
    <br>You can see everybody around us here; we are happy.
    <br>We are going home with two bags of rice and money in our pockets.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Amen. Love looks around to see those who are in need
    <br>and we thank God that you who are in need are very appreciative of the wonderful gift of God
    <br>in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners. God bless you.
    <br>...as the reason for relationship.

    <br>We wish him all the best with God's love and protection.
    <br>Amen. Is this your first time at this programme?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What did you receive today?
    <br>God's love, so many things.
    <br>As you can see, we have two bags of rice and the money he gave us.
    <br>May God guide and protect him, bless him the more.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>Today you are here at the meeting of the physically challenged with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and you received two bags of rice and 5,000 naira. How do you feel?
    <br>I am very happy!
    <br>I thank him very much.
    <br>May God bless him.
    <br>I pray for more blessings for him. God should bless him more.
    <br>God bless you, sir. We pray that you have a safe trip back home.
    <br>Thank you
    <br>Thank you very much. God bless you.
    <br>...more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give...
    <br>Peace be unto you!
    <br>We are thanking T.B. Joshua for the gifts and for what he has done for us.
    <br>May God bless him.
    <br>Everyone of us who are physically challenged have been blessed with a gift from him.
    <br>May God bless him more and more - a hundredfold.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>...multiplied back to us
    <br>Every true friendship...
    <br>Hello, sir. How are you?
    <br>Fine. Thank you. God bless you.
    <br>Thank you. I appreciate it.
    <br>I pray that God will provide everything he needs.
    <br>Thank you.

    <br>Oluwole from Ekiti (Nigeria).
    <br>So you came all the way from Ekiti State to this special meeting with Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>We really enjoyed the meeting with Pastor T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We are very excited about the gifts from Pastor T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What did you receive? What are you going home with?
    <br>Two bags of rice and 5,000 naira each.
    <br>Have a safe journey back home. Thank you very much for coming. Bye bye.
    <br>Please tell us your name.
    <br>I'm Pauline.
    <br>And where did you come from?
    <br>I'm coming from Abia State (Nigeria).
    <br>In fact, I can't really express myself.
    <br>I really didn't expect this. Seriously, I'm very grateful.
    <br>I pray and ask God to add more grease to his elbows.
    <br>Amen. Is this your first time?
    <br>It is my first time.
    <br>Tell us - what did you receive today?
    <br>I received a big token of 5,000 naira and two bags of rice.
    <br>And you are glad about that?
    <br>I am very glad.
    <br>Those who have been criticising the man of God,
    <br>I really don't see the reason why they should do that.
    <br>I think that the person who God has blessed, God has blessed that person
    <br>and the person who God has given a gift, He has given him that gift.
    <br>I am telling people of the world that they shouldn't criticise a man of God;
    <br>he is a very good man. God is really using him.
    <br>I am very grateful and very happy for today.
    <br>Thank you very much. And we wish you a safe journey back home
    <br>and hope to see you next time at this meeting, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank you.

    <br>But today's own was great!
    <br>When I saw the number of people,
    <br>I said to myself, "What people would take away today would be 1,000 naira and a bag of rice".
    <br>When the man of God said he was going to give each person 5,000, I said, "Wow! This is great!"
    <br>With this number of people, giving them 5,000 naira each and two bags of rice,

    <br>People should emulate what Prophet T.B. Joshua is doing.
    <br>We wish you a safe journey back home, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Emmanuel! Indeed, God is with us.
    <br>Here we have physically challenged people.
    <br>To the glory of God, they had their meeting here with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And they were blessed tremendously through the kind gesture of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and now they are embarking on their journey back home.
    <br>So here we have the bus that conveyed people from Ekiti State
    <br>to The SCOAN for the physically challenged meeting that just concluded some hours ago.
    <br>So right now, based on the philanthropic nature and kind gesture of the man of God,
    <br>he said we should give the money they used in transporting themselves
    <br>from their various destinations to The SCOAN.
    <br>The cost is 15,000 naira - this is it.
    <br>Now, the prophet loves you for being patient enough
    <br>to convey them from Lagos to The SCOAN.
    <br>For that reason, he said we should give you this cash gift and two bags of rice.
    <br>Now, to our coordinator.
    <br>The prophet loves you and your colleagues who are the physically challenged.
    <br>The prophet said we should give you 80,000 naira
    <br>which is the cost of your transportation from Lagos back to Ekiti State.
    <br>The cost is 80,000 naira which the prophet said we should give you.
    <br>Thank you very much. We really appreciate what Pastor T.B. Joshua did for us.
    <br>The cost is 80,000 naira which the prophet said we should give you.
    <br>I thank him very much. May God give him long life and prosperity.
    <br>For doing this, God will bless him very well.
    <br>God will bless him so much.
    <br>We are from Ekiti State.
    <br>We really appreciate what the man of God did for us. The man is a great hero.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>...we receive more of whatever we give
    <br>When we give, we are planting seeds that will be multiplied...
    <br>Emmanuel!

    <br>My name is Yemisi Salami.
    <br>I am from Akure, Women With Diabilities.
    <br>The main reason why I am here is for the man of God to help me
    <br>because walking is not easy for me.
    <br>I am a bit big; so it is not easy for me.
    <br>And today, God Almighty has met you at the point of your need.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, together with the Emmanuel TV Partners from all over the world,
    <br>has provided this wheelchair for you and a cash gift of 5,000 naira
    <br>and also two bags of rice. How are you feeling now?
    <br>I am feeling very happy and very great.
    <br>I really thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>They have been helping us.
    <br>They never leave us or make us feel that we are different.
    <br>I just want to say thank you. God bless you, continuously.
    <br>We pray that you will be in prosperous, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>You are welcome to the physically challenged meeting with T.B. Joshua
    <br>today here at The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>My name is Abioloa Rahman.
    <br>I am from Disabled Welfare, Lagos.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Tell us the main reason why you are here at The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God wants to bless us.
    <br>We really appreciate him.
    <br>He has been showing love and care.
    <br>We want Nigerians to emulate him.
    <br>If other people could emulate him, the way he shows love, care...
    <br>I want Nigerians to emulate the man of God.
    <br>I feel so touched that that kind of a man can be humble to assist the less privileged in society.
    <br>Wow. It is the duty of all Christians because Christians are known by their love
    <br>and the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, really knows this.
    <br>Can you please tell us about the challenges you have been facing so far.
    <br>It is not really easy - someone with a disability in Nigeria.
    <br>We are not recognised. We are neglected.
    <br>So, we are happy for someone like Prophet T.B. Joshua who can remember us.
    <br>Somebody called me that I should come.
    <br>When I came, I didn't expect to be given a wheelchair.
    <br>But I thank God. God blessed me today with the man of God.
    <br>Wow. We thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>It shows that Jesus Christ knows who you are,
    <br>He knows the design of your heart and He has met you today at the point of your need
    <br>through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>You have received today a cash gift, two bags of rice and also a wheelchair.
    <br>And how are you feeling now after receiving all these?
    <br>I feel great. I am very happy.
    <br>I pray that the good Lord will bless the church and the man of God.
    <br>Blessed be the name of the Lord; that God will bless His people and the man of God
    <br>more and more abundantly, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank you very much for coming.
    <br>We pray to see you again next time, in Jesus' name.
    <br>...back to us
    <br>Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for...
    <br>My name is Tunrayo Ajetunmobi.
    <br>I'm from Kwara State (Nigeria); Lagos State Disabled Association.
    <br>This is not my first time of coming here. This is my third time of coming here.
    <br>For long, I have been in need of a wheelchair
    <br>but there was nobody to help me get one.
    <br>If I walk too much, I have back pain and side pain.
    <br>So, sometimes, it would make me not to go out.
    <br>Right here at the physcially challenged meeting with T.B. Joshua,
    <br>God Almighty, Jesus Christ, has met you at the point of your need.
    <br>You have received a cash gift of 5,000 naira from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and also two bags of rice and a wheelchair as you have requested today
    <br>from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV Partners from all over the world.
    <br>How are you feeling now?
    <br>I am very grateful. I thank T.B. Joshua for showing love to us.
    <br>Titilayo Mosunbola.
    <br>I am from Lagos State (Nigeria).
    <br>How did you hear about this meeting?
    <br>I've heard a lot from my friends who had been here before me
    <br>telling me the good things that the man of God has been doing for them.
    <br>He is a very friendly person with those who have been marginalised against,
    <br>like the dwarves and physically challenged persons.
    <br>So, that was why I came to this place today
    <br>with the expectation of getting a wheelchair and financial assistance.
    <br>We saw you earlier today, coming here to the physcially challenged meeting
    <br>with T.B. Joshua with your own wheelchair.
    <br>I borrowed that one; it is not my own.
    <br>It is a borrowed wheelchair.
    <br>Ok. And today God Almighty, Jesus Christ, has met you at the point of your need
    <br>through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, together with the Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>to provide this wheelchair that you are sitting on right now
    <br>and also two bags of rice and a cash gift of 5,000 naira.
    <br>I am very grateful to him and I am very happy within me
    <br>and I want to use this medium to bless the man of God,
    <br>that God will bless and increase him and continue to motivate him.
    <br>More grease to his elbows.
    <br>I am also using this medium to send a message to the whole world
    <br>that people should emulate this great man of God
    <br>because he has left a legacy for us to emulate.
    <br>God will reward all the people who have been supporting.
    <br>All the workers I have seen here today have been very great. God bless you.
    <br>...love
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason...

    <br>You have been in the physically challenged meeting today with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>How do you feel?
    <br>I feel so great and happy. I can't express my feelings.
    <br>It is amazing. I really appreciate the man of god.
    <br>The man of God is trying and I pray for more anointing,
    <br>that God will continue to empower him and bless him more.
    <br>As he continues to bless us, so also, God will continue to bless his family.
    <br>Now tell us, what did you receive today?

    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>On behalf of our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>we believe you have enjoyed yourselves
    <br>and you have received a lot of things to give thanks to Jesus.
    <br>So for this reason, the man of God has decided to bless you
    <br>since you have decided to honour his invitation.
    <br>So right here with me, I have an envelope.
    <br>This one contains transportation for everyone inside the vehicle - 15,000 naira.
    <br>And here with me, sir, this is a gift from our father in the Lord, T.B. Joshua - 5,000 naira.
    <br>And here with me are also two bags of rice.
    <br>God bless you!
    <br>We thank our pastor, Pastor Temitope Joshua - a man of the people.
    <br>...love
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You know that Jesus loves you.
    <br>Thank you for coming here and thank you for accepting the gift.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The man of God has said you are blessed.
    <br>And all your transport from here to your home, the man of God has paid everything.
    <br>You don't need to pay anything. Everything is provided for.
    <br>So, driver, this is a blessing for you.
    <br>This is for you personally. 5,000 for you.
    <br>And the man of God gives you two bags of rice.
    <br>The Prophet has provided 15,000 to pay for your transport back home.
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>When we give...
    <br>My name is Oluwaseyi Ojerinde.
    <br>I want to thank the man of God. He always cares for us.

    <br>Thank you. God bless you.
    <br>My name is Omobolanle Adams.
    <br>I thank our father for remembering us again.
    <br>We give glory to the Lord for all that he has done for us.
    <br>May the Lord continue to bless him and all the members, in Jesus' name.
    <br>God bless you. Thank you.
    <br>When we give, we receive more of whatever...
    <br>We have here 5,000 naira for the driver of the bus. That is for you, sir.
    <br>And two bags of rice.
    <br>That is not all. We also have 15,000 naira here for all your transportation back home again.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, I thank you very much. God bless you.
    <br>...we are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to us

    <br>I transported them here.
    <br>Driver, what we have here is the transport fee
    <br>for the group of people that came all the way from Osun State so they don't owe you anything.

    <br>So, you have in total received 5,000 naira from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua and two bags of rice
    <br>to bless you for bringing our friends to The SCOAN.
    <br>I don't know what to say. I am thanking the members of the church,
    <br>the whole crew and T.B. Joshua - more grease to his elbows and long life.
    <br>...must be mutual trust, mutual faith, mutual love
