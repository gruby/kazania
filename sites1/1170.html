    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>With all your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>With all your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Now you are leaving, you are not only leaving but you are a representative of Jesus.
    <br>Where there is hate, you are love.
    <br>Where there is sin, you are forgiveness.
    <br>Where there is wrong, you are what?
    <br>Where there is injury, you are a pardon.
    <br>Where there is darkness - shining light.
    <br>It is time now to begin to make a call to those who have wronged you,
    <br>you say over your dead body, you will never forgive.
    <br>If you are shy to make a statement, just send a text message, "I love you".
    <br>If someone that has actually been seeing you as an enemy and you just text, "I love you so much",
    <br>it means a lot.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Because of your tomorrow, because of your next.
    <br>Holding offence is a crime.
    <br>Say, because of my next, holding offence is a crime; whether you are right or wrong, it's a crime.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Because your next - God is busy preparing a table before you
    <br>and on top of the table, every essential of life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>But if you hold offence, you hold grudges, it will affect your next.
    <br>This is your next.
    <br>My next - move, what is your next?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>And God owns your next.
    <br>You own now but God owns what? - Next.
    <br>So please, don't forget.
    <br>What you are seeing now is preparing a table before you in the presence of who?
    <br>[My enemies.]
    <br>No no no, not your enemy - those who do not want to see you,
    <br>in the presence of those who do not want to see you, who do not want to hear your voice.
    <br>Those who do not want to see you, they are not your enemy.
    <br>You know an enemy, the word enemy is too big - it is too costly to you, for you Christians.
    <br>Somebody who is making things possible for you, you now see as an enemy.
    <br>Whatever anybody is doing to you is making you known all over the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Whatever attack anyone is planning against you is making you known.
    <br>You know how you make me known all over, you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>"I bind T.B. Joshua, I loose T.B. Joshua" - makes T.B. Joshua known all over.
    <br>They are not your enemy.
    <br>So right now, whatever offence, holding offence,
    <br>whatever anyone might have done to you - I know, wrong, a lot of wrong -
    <br>please leave it for God, leave it for next.
    <br>Say, leave it for next.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Leave it for next - because of your next, offence is a crime.
    <br>Hallelujah!
