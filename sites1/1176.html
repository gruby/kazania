    <br>IN MEMORY OF THE MARTYRS OF FAITH
    <br>Those who try to kill us are only helping us to go home and rest.
    <br>Whether we die young or old, what matters is the grace to continue living hereafter.
    <br>It is now four years since our beloved brothers and sisters slept in the Lord.
    <br>We must realise that their death is an unavoidable call -
    <br>a call to our Heavenly home that no one can disobey.
    <br>Jesus said that if you do not take up your cross and deny yourself daily
    <br>and perhaps even get killed for your belief in Him,
    <br>you are not worthy of Him.
    <br>(Matthew 10:38; Matthew 16:24)
    <br>The level at which satan attacks us seems to be equal to the level of our commmitment to the Lord.
    <br>I don't think enough people understand this.
    <br>If you are totally committed to God, He will take up satan's challenge against you.
    <br>As soon as we make a true conversion, a commitment asking Jesus to purchase us,
    <br>we become Jesus' property.
    <br>Then satan hates us the same way he hates Jesus.
    <br>That is why the moment we are truly saved,
    <br>we are engaged in a phenomental battle.
    <br>(John 15:18-22)
    <br>We cannot separate warfare from salvation.
    <br>True salvation is going to put you into direct conflict with satan.
    <br>Many of us would say, "Why should I suffer or die?
    <br>After all, Jesus won the victory on the Cross and suffered for me!"
    <br>But the question we need to ask ourselves is, "What did Jesus say?"
    <br>He said, "I have said unto you, the servant is not greater than his Master.
    <br>If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you". (John 15:20)
    <br>Anyone who claims that he does not have to suffer because Jesus did it for him
    <br>is indirectly saying that he is greater than his Master.
    <br>He is actually contradicting what Jesus said.
    <br>Basically, we need to give up our lives here on earth and gain eternal life in Heaven.
    <br>When we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour,
    <br>we are accepting citizenship in Heaven and death here on earth.
    <br>Once Christ purchases us, we become aliens here on earth
    <br>and there is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.
    <br>We are servants, we simply obey the command of our Master.
    <br>We do not decide what suffering we must bear.
    <br>Many people have been serving the Lord fervently and have come into difficult life situations
    <br>because of being mistreated by either wicked men or carnal Christians.
    <br>The truth is that they have been treated unjustly.
    <br>But to become offended will only fulfill the enemy's purpose
    <br>of getting them out of the will of God.
    <br>If you stay free from offence, you will stay in God's will.
    <br>If you become offended, you will be taken captive by the enemy
    <br>to fulfill his own purpose and will.
    <br>If we are Christ's followers, we must follow His example.
    <br>If He could forgive the people who were killing Him,
    <br>we can certainly find a way to forgive those who hurt us.
    <br>When we cannot forgive, we hurt ourselves more than anyone.
    <br>Nursing a grudge damages our heart.
    <br>Life is too short to waste our time on things that have no lasting value or significance.
    <br>From eternity's perspective, death is not a period; it is only a comma
    <br>because of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection.
    <br>When a believer dies, he goes into glory, where there is no conflict.
    <br>Heaven is our home.
    <br>A man may die young yet be satisfied with living
    <br>but a wicked man is not satisfied even with long life.
    <br>Those who try to kill us are only helping us to go home and rest.
    <br>But those who send us home will go into further conflict;
    <br>they will have more questions to answer than when they were alive.
    <br>The wicked seem to prosper now and live without a care
    <br>but they will spend eternity in terror and despair.
    <br>How can we honour the memory of the martyrs of faith?
    <br>Endeavour by the grace of God to live for the Lord
    <br>and give yourself to the needs of others.
    <br>Romans 14:8 says, "If we live, we live for the Lord;
    <br>and if we die, we die for the Lord.
    <br>So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord".
    <br>What a blessed memorial!
    <br>How do I end this write-up?
    <br>Here, I drop my pen." - Prophet T.B. Joshua
