  <p>    
    <br>My name is Dede Folie
    <br>and  this is my daughter Phillipa Aboamah and Lawrence Aboamah
    <br>and this is my granddaughter called Aaliyah Aboamah.
    <br>My testimony goes like:
    <br>On the 12th of April 2016,, my granddaughter fell from the sixth floor in London
    <br>So after that, I rushed down the steps.
    <br>I had pressed the lift but the lift wasn't working so I started running down the steps.
    <br>She couldn't walk; she was totally paralyzed.
    <br>So the ambulance came and took her to the hospital.
    <br>She couldn't walk; she couldn't do anything.
    <br>I then went home. I was having the Anointed Water at home which I had gotten from The SCOAN.
    <br>So when I went home, I took the Anointed Water with me back to the hospital.
    <br>When I got to the hospital, I sprayed the water on her.
    <br>After I had sprayed the water, she started moving the first hand,
    <br>the second hand, her leg, and the second leg.
    <br>Before she moved her legs, I was holding the Holy Water.
    <br>I sprayed it on her. I said, "In the mighty name of Jesus, Aaliyah, be healed!
    <br>Raise up your leg!" because she wasn't doing anything, she couldn't raise her leg up.
    <br>She couldn't raise anything up. She was totally paralyzed so I just sprayed the water.
    <br>I said again, "In the mighty name of Jesus, Aaliyah, be healed! Raise your leg up!"
    <br>because it was left with one leg. She couldn't raise it up.
    <br>Immediately I sprinkled the Anointed Water, she raised her leg up.
    <br>Everybody was shouting and my daughter said, "Oh Mummy!"
    <br>After ministering the Morning Water, she began to walk. Is that correct?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok. What happened today when you brought her to The SCOAN?
    <br>When I brought her to The SCOAN, she wasn't walking properly because of her spine.
    <br>She was always falling; she kept on falling. She couldn't walk properly.
    <br>So when we brought her now, by the grace of God, when Prophet T.B. Joshua came
    <br>and prayed for her, she started walking.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>She was having a body brace and a foot brace.
    <br>Ok. What happened today when the prophet laid his hand on her?
    <br>After the prophet prayed for her, without the brace, she is alright now.
    <br>She began to walk.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that!
    <br>Dede Folie & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>This was the newspaper - they wrote about it in the newspaper.
    <br>It was written there: "It is a miracle she's walking again."
    <br>Dede Folie & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>The fact that Aaliyah is able to walk today is remarkable.
    <br>She fell from this top floor window breaking her spine just six weeks ago.
    <br>Doctors feared she would never walk again.
    <br>I was just like in shock. I went running downstairs and whilst I was even running downstairs,
    <br>I was calling an ambulance. The woman wasn't getting the address.
    <br>She wasn't getting anything I was trying to say to her because I was so much in tears.
    <br>Still in the hospital but recovering fast, saved by a fortunate sequence of events.
    <br>When Aaliyah's mum got there, a witness persuaded her not to move the two-year-old,
    <br>protecting Aaliyah from further back injury.
    <br>At the time she was moaning, "Mum, mum!"
    <br>I replied, "Yes". Then the man told me, "You cant touch her because you will mess up the bones
    <br>in her body further because she has broken bones".
    <br>I think he knew that she had broken bones.
    <br>He was a blessing to actually be there because I would have carried her.
    <br>It's only when you are here that you get an idea of the scale of this fall.
    <br>We are on the ground floor. 50 feet higher is the fifth floor
    <br>and that's how far Aaliyah fell
    <br>It was extremely lucky that she didn't suffer much more serious injuries.
    <br>She could have indeed lost her life.
    <br>The speed with which she has recovered is very, very impressive.
    <br>1.2.3.4.5.6.7......
    <br>Where she fell from, the windows were open, there were satellite dishes.
    <br>I was just in shock. It was heartbreaking. It was traumatising.
    <br>And it was like, how did she not hit all the windows or the satellite dishes?
    <br>itv news
    <br>This was after you had administered the Morning Water on her.
    <br>After I had administered the Morning Water, she started walking.
    <br>She got out of the hospital bed and began to walk.
    <br>Yes, she began to walk.
    <br>It was amazing anyway because they were surprised.
    <br>All of them were asking me, "Oh how did you do it?"
    <br>because all of them had said that the baby wouldn't walk again.
    <br>After falling from such a height, she was supposed to be paralysed.
    <br>So the doctor told her that she was not going to walk again.
    <br>They even got her a wheelchair, everything for her,
    <br>and I told her, "I am serving a living God.
    <br>My granddaughter is going to walk again, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Then they said, "Oh". Another guy asked me, "Which church are you attending?"
    <br>I said, "I am attending The Synagogue Church Of All Nations".
    <br>You finally brought her to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations today...
    <br>Yes
    <br>...because her spinal cord was fractured and she was not steady in her movement.
    <br>Yes, she wasn't steady in her movement.
    <br>And what happened today when the prophet laid his hand on her?
    <br>When the prophet laid his hand on her, she started walking alright,
    <br>moving alright and everything was ok with her.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Ok. Let's hear briefly from the mother of the girl.
    <br>Tell us your name and where you come from.
    <br>My name is Phillipa Oboamah and I'm coming from London.
    <br>I just want to thank God for everything that He has done for me
    <br>because without Hi,m I dont think I would be here.
    <br>I think I would be going through stress or depression now if I hadn't turned to Him.
    <br>You heard it from her. She said that she is the mother of this little girl who had that accident
    <br>because she fell from the height of 60 feet.
    <br>Hello. I am Lawrence Boamah. This is my sister, my mum and my niece Aaliyah.
    <br>I would like to thank God for what He has done in my family's life and everything
    <br>because we never knew she would walk again.
    <br>She was actually having difficulty in walking
    <br>until my mum sprayed the Anointing Water on her.
    <br>It was just amazing because everyone in the hospital was shocked.
    <br>They were saying, "Ah, she wont walk again" and stuff like that.
    <br>My mum was praying all the time.
    <br>Everyone was praying with the Morning Water, praying to the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I would like to thank God for what He has done in my family's life.
    <br>Ok. What happened to the life of your niece today when the prophet laid his hand on her?
    <br>After the prophet had laid his hand on my niece, she is walking alright now.
    <br>The brace is off now. As you can see, she is walking without the brace.
    <br>Ok. Now she doesnt need the brace anymore. What do you want to do with it?
    <br>I will throw it away.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>That is a clear proof that the little girl is completely free.
    <br>You heard it all. They said that they no longer want to use the body brace anymore
    <br>for this little girl because she is completely free.
    <br>Can you now go to the notice board and tell us the pictures we seeing there?
    <br>Explain the pictures.
    <br>Alright, This is a picture of when she fell and she was in an ambulance.
    <br>This one over here.
    <br>And this was when she was in intensive care.
    <br>This was when she wasn't even moving her leg - both of these pictures.
    <br>In all of these pictures she wasn't moving her leg
    <br>until my mum sprayed the Anointing Water. Then she started walking.
    <br>There are more pictures.
    <br>These are all pictures of when she was in intensive care.
    <br>So after ministering the Morning Water, she was actually the one who stood there.
    <br>She was walking. She wasn't even sitting on these things.
    <br>She wasn't sitting on these wheelchairs again. She was just walking around,
    <br>and that's when they gave her the brace.
    <br>When the prophet laid his hands on her, she started walking okay
    <br>and as you can see, she is walking okay.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that!
    <br>And finally, what word of advice do you have, Mama,
    <br>for what the Lord has done in the life of your granddaughter?
    <br>The advice I have for my fellow brothers and sisters:
    <br>Whenever you have a problem, seek the favour of God.
    <br>He is the only one who will help you.
    <br>Amen
    <br>I just want to say that everyone should watch their child wherever they go
    <br>and just give your faith to Christ.
    <br>Amen. We thank God Almighty for what He has done in the life of the little girl
    <br>as we can see her moving around. This is a clear proof that she could walk
    <br>after the touch from His able servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>As you go and make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>we pray your miracle will remain permanent, in Jesus' name
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
