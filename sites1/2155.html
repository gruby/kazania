  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>The resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ is the joy of Christians.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>The Spirit of God is going to lead me to talk about what it means to be a Christian.
    <br>When we become a Christian, does it mean we cannot sin or wrong?
    <br>This is what we are going to talk about today
    <br>because the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ is the joy of Christians all over the world,
    <br>the joy of His friends.
    <br>Let me give you some of the Bible passages that will give you details about resurrection.
    <br>The Book of Matthew 27. Start from verse 1 to the end, for more detail.
    <br>And the Book of Matthew 28 from verse 5 to 11. I will advise you to take it from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>Romans 6 verse 8 to 11, or you can take it from verse 1 to 11.
    <br>And the Book of Titus 3 verse 3 to 6.
    <br>That will be my proof reading today.
    <br>So, I'm taking you to the Book of Titus 3 verse 3 to 6 (NIV).
    <br>"At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures.
    <br>We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.
    <br>But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,
    <br>He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy.
    <br>He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
    <br>whom He poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Saviour."
    <br>Take your time to read.
    <br>Once again, Happy Easter!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>As a minister of God, I have seen that people give numerous reasons for calling themselves Christians.
    <br>For instance, they say, "I was born a Christian and I grew up in the church."
    <br>"I am a Christian because my parents are believers."
    <br>"I am a Christian because I am a publisher of the Bible."
    <br>"I am a Christian because I am the founder or a General Overseer of a church."
    <br>"I am a Christian because I am convinced that Jesus is the Son of God."
    <br>My problem with these answers is that they don't mention the only reason that qualifies someone as a Christian.
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>My problem with these answers is that they don't mention the only reason that qualifies someone as a Christian.
    <br>Viewers, here is the challenge.
    <br>You can attend church and not be a Christian.
    <br>You can read the Bible and not be a Christian.
    <br>You can eliminate bad habits and try to be a moral person and still not be a Christian.
    <br>All these habits are good, but the actions alone do not make a person a Christian.
    <br>Who is a Christian then, viewers?
    <br>A Christian is a person whom God has forgiven through the finished work of Jesus Christ on the Cross,
    <br>as the Book of Titus 3:3-6 said.
    <br>WHO IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>We are Christians because of the finished work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
    <br>Man is a sinner who has fallen short of God's standard.
    <br>God came to the earth in the person of Jesus Christ, died for us and paid for our sin.
    <br>Through our faith in Him, we receive His righteousness, we receive His forgiveness of our sins
    <br>and the gift of eternal life.
    <br>Eternal
    <br>Eternal life
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>Viewers all over the world, once again,
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>WHO IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Jesus died on the Cross for me and you.
    <br>He died for us, He loves us, He forgives us
    <br>and when we open our heart, He forgives us.
    <br>WHO IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of
    <br>Acts of Apostles chapter 16 verse 30 - 31.
    <br>This is the case of a law enforcement officer who once asked the Apostle Paul the most important question:
    <br>What must I do to be saved?
    <br>Paul answered, "Believe in the Lord Jesus;
    <br>you will be saved."
    <br>Here is the point, viewers!
    <br>Being a Christian is not about what you do;
    <br>it is about what Christ Jesus has done.
    <br>He loves us, He died for us, He forgives us
    <br>when we open our hearts to believe.
    <br>Viewers, I have two issues for you today.
    <br>Now, when you are a Christian,
    <br>can you do wrong or commit sin?
    <br>A Christian can do wrong.
    <br>When a Christian sins, he does not lose his place as a son but loses his fellowship.
    <br>He can immediately go to God about his behaviour and the Lord will forgive him
    <br>and help him not to make the same mistake again.
    <br>When we make a mistake, we run to God;
    <br>we do not run from God.
    <br>When a tree is cut down, the root will still be there.
    <br>Our faith may fail, but not utterly.
    <br>Our faith may fail, but not fall off.
    <br>Faith is our root.
    <br>Faith is our seed for it remains in us.
    <br>We always come to repentance each time we miss the mark;
    <br>that is a true Christian, a true believer.
    <br>I mean, those who are born of the Word and the Spirit.
    <br>Not only must we have God's Word in order to be born again, we must have God's Spirit.
    <br>Though there may be many instances of failing in the faith of true believers,
    <br>it is certain that there shall not be a total and final failure of their faith because faith is their root.
    <br>Viewers, how do we know a true believer?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask me at this moment.
    <br>How do we know a true born again?
    <br>How do we know a true Christian?
    <br>We know a true Christian when he runs to God each time he misses the mark.
    <br>Each time he wrongs, he runs to God.
    <br>We know a true Christian, a true believer, when he runs to God each time he misses the mark.
    <br>When we make a mistake, we run to God;
    <br>we do not run from Him.
    <br>WHO IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Viewers, let me just come down.
    <br>Finally, let us take a look at the Book of Psalm 51 verse 3 (NIV).
    <br>What does he say here?
    <br>"For I know my transgressions
    <br>and my sin is always before me."
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>Our sin is always before us - what does that mean?
    <br>This means the guilt of our sin is always troubling our heart.
    <br>WHO IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>And when our heart is troubled, it cannot be at its best.
    <br>We worship God, we are in line with God when our heart is at its best.
    <br>WHO IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>This is the man with a conscience - a true believer, a true born again, a true Christian.
