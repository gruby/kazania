    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Ataikiru Usiwoma.
    <br>I am a Nigerian and a doctor working in Romania.
    <br>From the time I was born, I had the problem with bedwetting.
    <br>We went to the hospital and they said that with time it would go.
    <br>It continued, even when I went to medical school.
    <br>Because of it, I could not visit my aunties or go and sleep the night somewhere;
    <br>it would surely happen every time I slept - daily or twice in a day.
    <br>It made me withdraw.
    <br>I am the eldest but I did not know why my younger ones were not going through it.
    <br>I studied in a medical school in Ukraine.
    <br>So you mean to say, sister that this problem of bedwetting you had right from birth;
    <br>it was everyday.
    <br>You were bedwetting both in the nights, afternoon, anytime you slept this would happen.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I was in Ukraine, if I had mistakenly stayed in my room-mate's bed, it would happen.
    <br>They would see me moving but would not know what was happening.
    <br>I would clean it and iron it.
    <br>I later met a Ghanaian doctor who introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>When we were about five years old, they were sharing flyers saying Emmanuel TV was demonic.
    <br>Because of that, my parents and I withdrew.
    <br>When he told me to watch it, I just smiled and did not watch it.
    <br>So a pastor talked about a church and said that he had a video to show us.
    <br>While he was showing the video to discourage people,
    <br>God asked me if I had really watched this man to confirm what he was actually doing.
    <br>That day I took the boldness because the man said that if you turned on the video, the spirit could possess you.
    <br>That day I watched it and saw him calling Jesus and the things I believed was what he believed.
    <br>I continued watching it and prayed with Emmanuel TV
    <br>and the bedwetting immediately stopped - for six years now.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, we want you to explain, sister;
    <br>when you prayed along with Prophet T.B. Joshua - just describe to us what happened.
    <br>I just had peace as if everything was settled and immediately I laid my hands and prayed.
    <br>That was the end till now.
    <br>I slept and I woke up and there was nothing till now - there was no problem.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>So ever since you prayed along with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>since that moment the bedwetting that you were experiencing daily,
    <br>right from birth came to an instant end.
    <br>For how long now have you enjoyed this miracle?
    <br>Six years.
    <br>When I went to meet my sister in Canada,
    <br>she couldn't ask me because she didn't want me to feel bad.
    <br>She was just watching and watching and I said, "Don't worry. God has done it."
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>We thank God Almighty.
    <br>Our sister is a medical doctor currently in Romania.
    <br>While she was studying in Ukraine, she was introduced to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Even though she was discouraged from watching it,
    <br>she decided to see for herself what God was doing through Emmanuel TV
    <br>and that's how she received her instant deliverance from this curse of bedwetting
    <br>that had plagued her life since birth for 18 years.
    <br>We give all the glory to God.
    <br>What other testimonies do you have to share, sister?
    <br>My sister in Canada had been having some limitations in school -
    <br>she would always get A+ and carry home all the awards - the Dean's award, scholarships
    <br>but they just stopped giving her.
    <br>The course that was for four years became six years.
    <br>After the six years, they told her that they were going to expel her and she is the best student.
    <br>She was tired and didn't know what to do and she was still sceptical.
    <br>I turned on Emmanuel TV which I had on 24 hours a day.
    <br>We watched it, prayed with it and when she was sleeping, I sprayed the Morning Water on her.
    <br>When she woke up, she felt peace and received direction on what to do.
    <br>She went back to school and was supposed to do the four years all over again
    <br>but she graduated after one year with a First Class Distinction, not just a First Class.
    <br>"I WAS WARNED TO NEVER WATCH EMMANUEL TV!!!"
    <br>Not just First Class but a First Class Distinction.
    <br>So she was the best of the best.
    <br>She is the one here.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We can just imagine this wonderful blessing that has extended to our sister's family as well;
    <br>her sister in Canada was also a wonderful beneficiary of this great blessing.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>This is the sister we have just heard about - in the picture here,
    <br>who after praying along with Emmanuel TV
    <br>and our sister ministered the Morning Water to her while she was sleeping,
    <br>she received a wonderful breakthrough in academics and we give all the glory to God Almighty.
    <br>So sister, in the light of what Jesus Christ has done for you,
    <br>what is your advice to people all over the world?
    <br>My advice is for anyone who is going through any situation that seems impossible,
    <br>they should remember God's Word that with God, nothing is impossible.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And also sister, we know that it was Emmanuel TV that God used as the instrument
    <br>to actually deliver you.
    <br>We know there are many viewers all over the world who may not be able to physically come
    <br>to The  SCOAN because of their location but they are watching right now.
    <br>What is your advice to people?
    <br>What they should do when Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for viewers?
    <br>How they should connect by faith, knowing that distance is not a barrier?
    <br>Yes. They should know that distance is not a barrier and so whenever he is praying,
    <br>they should lay their hands by faith and be assured that God is everywhere and He will do it.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
