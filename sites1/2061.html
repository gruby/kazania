    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>My name is Giorgina and I am from The Dominican Republic.
    <br>Can you tell us who is the person beside you?
    <br>She is my sister, Teresita.
    <br>What was the problem that brought you to the crusade with Prophet TB Joshua in The Dominican Republic?
    <br>I had a cervical hernia.
    <br>I was using a neck collar and a cervical traction device.
    <br>I was using a neck collar since 2007 - almost 10 years
    <br>This problem affected me a lot. I couldn't move my neck.
    <br>I was always taking sick leave at work because my left arm was in pain and I couldn't move it.
    <br>It affected my life a lot because I couldn't even move my neck.
    <br>And at work I couldn't do my job well - I had to take sick leave because I wasn't feeling well.
    <br>This problem also affected my left arm.

    <br>Thank You, God!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I felt a touch of deliverance and was released from what was holding me down.
    <br>For some moments, I felt as if I blacked out.
    <br>When I opened my eyes, I felt strength to stand up.
    <br>At the crusade I felt a touch of deliverance.
    <br>At first I fell, but then when I opened my eyes, I just felt a strength that helped me get up.
    <br>I also felt that something that was holding me down just left my body.
    <br>Before, I couldn't move my neck. Now, I can turn it freely.
    <br>I couldn't wear high-heeled shoes, but right now I am wearing them.
    <br>Previously, I couldn't move my neck to the sides; I had to hold my head in only direction.
    <br>Now I can move my neck freely.
    <br>Previously, I also couldn't wear high-heeled shoes, but now I am able to. Thanks be to God.
    <br>I am healed indeed!
    <br>I can turn my neck and raise my head freely!
    <br>I can lift objects and raise my arm!
    <br>I can bend down!
    <br>I can move freely; I can turn my neck and raise my legs.
    <br>Now I can move my neck to the side.
    <br>I can look up; I can look down.
    <br>I can bend. And also, I can walk straight and raise my head.
    <br>My name is Teresita. She is my sister, Giorgina.
    <br>We went to the crusade because she had a cervical hernia, which caused her severe pain.
    <br>She received her miracle through Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>We came to the crusade because my sister had a cervical hernia.
    <br>But after the man of God prayed for her, she received her miracle. Now she is healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I advise the whole world to have faith and believe in Jesus Christ.
    <br>I invite all the people in the world to have faith.
    <br>Thank You!
