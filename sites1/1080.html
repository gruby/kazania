    <br>This mother and child have come to The SCOAN with a strange predicament.
    <br>The medical report states that the young child had swallowed a foreign object,
    <br>that is now stuck in his small throat.
    <br>The question is: What object did he swallow?
    <br>Shockingly, the X-ray of the one-year-old clearly shows a cross pendant securely lodged in his throat.
    <br>The presence of such a large foreign object in the throat of a one-year-old boy
    <br>must cause extreme discomfort and pain.
    <br>If the object is not removed, it could be fatal.
    <br>His mother has brought him to The SCOAN in desperate need of Divine intervention.
    <br>Let's hear what happened.
    <br>My name is Gift Stephen.
    <br>I come from Ebonyi State.
    <br>The baby I am carrying is my baby, Meshak Stephen - 1 year and five months.
    <br>Tell us the problem you have brought to The SCOAN today.
    <br>The problem that brought me here is that my baby swallowed a foreign object
    <br>which is stuck in his throat.
    <br>Ok. You mean your baby has a foreign object in his throat.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>He swallowed a cross pendant and since then, he cannot sleep at night.
    <br>We as parents, will also not be able to sleep; we will be awake until daybreak.
    <br>He vomits blood because of the pendant stuck in his throat.
    <br>When I took him to the chemist, they told me that he swallowed a cross pendant.
    <br>I reached for my cross necklace around my neck but realised it was not there.
    <br>The chain was still around my neck but the cross was missing - he had swallowed it.
    <br>The cross he swallowed was part of my necklace.
    <br>Where have you taken him to for solution?
    <br>I took him to the chemist first and then to many hospitals.
    <br>They told me that the only solution was an operation.
    <br>And now that you are here in The SCOAN today: What is your belief in Christ Jesus?
    <br>I believe Jesus will heal my son, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Healing Time
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance to the people, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Among them is young Meshek Stephen and his mother who cries out to the man of God for help.
    <br>The lady is explaining that the baby she is holding swallowed a cross pendant as you can see in the X-ray.
    <br>So the cross pendant is now stuck in the throat of the baby.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prayer & Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>There is never a problem Jesus Christ cannot solve.
    <br>And with a touch from Heaven, he is free.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Gift. The man that is behind me is my husband.
    <br>The problem that brought me to this place was that of my son.
    <br>He swallowed a cross pendant.
    <br>What is the name of your son?
    <br>The name of my son is Meshack Stephen.
    <br>He swallowed a cross pendant when I was sleeping with him around 5:00 pm on Thursday.
    <br>The necklace clasp was open. He took it and swallowed it.
    <br>After he swallowed the cross pendant, I took him to the chemist.
    <br>The chemist said I should take him to the hospital, that it was serious.
    <br>I took him to the hospital and they took X-rays. The pendant could be seen.
    <br>I took him to another hospital and when we got there, the doctors said we should do another X-ray.
    <br>He said we should do an X-ray and come back.
    <br>We did the X-ray and could see the pendant; it had not moved at all.
    <br>We returned to the hospital.
    <br>They directed us to the place where they would operate on his neck to remove the pendant.
    <br>We were confused as to whether to perform the operation or not.
    <br>We took him out of the hospital because we were confused.
    <br>We brought him to The SCOAN and the man of God prayed for him.
    <br>When we got back home, my son vomited.
    <br>The next day, he started eating; before, he could only take custard or water.
    <br>Ok, let us take it one by one so that people will understand what you are saying.
    <br>So when your son swallowed the pendant, tell us what happened to your son.
    <br>When he swallowed the cross pendant, I was asleep.
    <br>When he started coughing and vomiting, I woke up.
    <br>My son vomited blood from his throat.
    <br>What were the things your son could not do then?
    <br>He could not sleep and he was always crying.
    <br>When he cried, he would point at his throat.
    <br>He was restless; he could not get himself.
    <br>What was he able to eat that time?
    <br>He could only drink tea, custard and water.
    <br>The mother further explained that when her son ingested this metallic cross object,
    <br>he could not eat then; the only thing her son could take were liquids.
    <br>The man of God prayed for him and after the prayer, we went back home.
    <br>That night, he vomited and after that, he slept.
    <br>When he woke up in the morning, I gave him tea.
    <br>He did not take the tea but kept pointing to the pot.
    <br>I gave him cooked food; he ate and did not vomit.
    <br>As it happened, he started eating everything he saw.
    <br>Because he was eating again, I took him back to the hospital to take another X-ray.
    <br>They could not find the pendant anymore.
    <br>Mrs Gift Stephen & Family
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>The mother further explained to the glory of God that after the prayer of the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B.Joshua, that when they got home, her son started vomiting and stooling.
    <br>And when the vomiting stopped, they found out their son could eat normally. 
    <br>They noticed that their son started eating anything he saw around.
    <br>He started eating the food they gave to him,
    <br>unlike before when he could only take tea or anything liquid
    <br>because of the metallic cross that was blocking the esophagus.
    <br>Even for him to swallow his own spit was a problem.
    <br>But after the prayer, their son was completely free.
    <br>Because their son had started eating, they took the boy to the same hospital that did the first X-ray
    <br>and they conducted another X-ray and found out that the object was no longer there.
    <br>That is what we are seeing on the screen right now.
    <br>Mrs Gift Stephen& Family
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>As you can see on the screen of your television set, that is the X-ray that was taken
    <br>after the prayer of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua that proves
    <br>that indeed, the object that was in the throat of their son is no longer there.
    <br>My name is Stephen Ogazie and the woman beside me is my wife and my son, Mesheck.
    <br>We both came from Ebonyi State, Nigeria.
    <br>As a matter of fact, I thank God for what God has done.
    <br>I came back from work and I found out that the child was vomiting blood.
    <br>So, I asked my wife what the matter was. She told me that she was looking for her cross pendant.
    <br>When they did the first X-ray and the report was brought to the doctor,
    <br>they saw an object, the cross pendant lodged in the child's throat.
    <br>The surgeon said that the only thing to do was to bring a certain amount of money,
    <br>N300,000 to N400,000, before he could start any work.
    <br>I began to recall some things that the Lord is doing in this great commission.
    <br>I knew that the case of this child was a solved case.
    <br>I knew fully well that if they had to operate on my child, they would not succeed
    <br>because that place is a delicate part of the body,
    <br>I knew that if this child underwent an operation, it would not succeed.
    <br>I began to have second thoughts, based on what the Lord is doing in this great commission.
    <br>I asked myself if it were not better that I run to God.
    <br>I had the opportunity on the 9th of September to come with my wife.
    <br>We had the opportunity to meet the man of God who laid hands on my child.
    <br>After that prayer, he pronounced liberty.
    <br>I was surprised.
    <br>As a matter of fact, we went back home that day and the vomiting increased.
    <br>I believe that the cross must have passed through that waste material.
    <br>We could not rest that night.
    <br>After that night, my child began to eat every food.
    <br>Initially,  he was only taking liquids but he began to eat every type of food.
    <br>He began to point to particular food that we should bring for him.
    <br>When I saw that that was the case, I went back to the same surgeon.
    <br>I said, "Sir, there is something I want to verify". He said, "What is that?"
    <br>I said, "I want to run another test on this child".
    <br>He agreed, told me the price and put my child on the machine for the X-ray.
    <br>They brought the X-ray report to the doctor and he shouted.
    <br>He said, "Oga, what did you use to remove it?" I said, "I did not use anything, only prayer".
    <br>Mr Stephen Ogazie & Family
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I said, "I did not use anything but prayer!"
    <br>He asked, "What kind of prayer removed it because even the operation we had wanted to carry out
    <br>was not even enough as only a specialist could operate on that area in a child?"
    <br>I said, "We went to The SCOAN". The man shouted.
    <br>I said, "I came to The SCOAN for prayer and my child was privileged
    <br>to receive prayer from the man Of God which led to freedom".
    <br>He then redid the test from his neck to the sole of his feet and didn't find anything wrong.
    <br>He then asked, "Is this magic?"
    <br>I told him, "It is not magic but the work of Jesus!"
    <br>The man said I should give glory to God as no man could do such a thing.
    <br>He said that this was a case which only God could visit.
    <br>The man still questioned whether I used something to bring out the cross
    <br>as he did not see any sore or sign of pain.
    <br>I said, "There was nothing like that; it was just prayer.
    <br>The man of God laid hands on him and prayed and that was the end.
    <br>He then advised us with confidence that the case was settled".
    <br>The doctor himself was surprised.
    <br>He was surprised. He asked again, "Where did you visit?" I said, "The SCOAN".
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.
    <br>What seems to be impossible with men is absolutely possible with God Almighty.
    <br>We have seen evidence that proves beyond reasonable doubt
    <br>that if not God, what do we think could have happened to this little boy?
    <br>But we give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful miracle that God has wrought in their life.
    <br>So tell us - what has been the condition of your son ever since then?
    <br>The condition of my child right from the day the man of God prayed for him -
    <br>he has not vomited since then.
    <br>The child has been free from all stress. He sleeps well; we hardly wake him.
    <br>He sleeps well, plays normally and can eat all kinds of food.
    <br>Because of this freedom, we determined to take him for a second X-ray, which we did.
    <br>This confirmed that the child now has a plain abdomen; the cross is no longer there.
    <br>When I met the doctor, I asked him to conduct another X-ray as practical evidence.
    <br>The doctor redid the X-ray and showed me the results on the screen.
    <br>He said, "There is no need to print it out as the case is settled and I should give glory to God".
    <br>Mr Stephen Ogazie & Family
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I just appreciate God. This is the first hospital we went where we were referred to another hospital.
    <br>Let's start from the top so that we can understand.
    <br>This is the first X-ray report which shows the child had an object in his lungs.
    <br>This is the second X-ray report which showed the cross was still there.
    <br>These reports you see here are referral letters to different hospitals.
    <br>This is the final X-ray report where the doctors confirmed there was no more foreign object.
    <br>They ran the test from the throat down to the abdomen and could not find the cross.
    <br>The man said we should give God thanks for settling this case as no man could do this but God.
    <br>So what we are seeing on the board is before and after.
    <br>Yes, before and after.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Just down there we can also see an X-ray.
    <br>Can you just tell us more about the X-ray we seeing there?
    <br>Yes. This is the first X-ray.
    <br>This is the second X-ray where the doctors wanted to compare if the cross was in the same position.
    <br>Then the last one here...
    <br>Just take it one after the other so that people can understand.
    <br>We have three X-rays there.
    <br>The first one we are seeing there is the first X-ray that was conducted
    <br>and they found out that the boy had ingested a metallic cross object
    <br>that we are seeing right there on the esophagus of the boy before they came to The SCOAN.
    <br>And after the prayer of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>they went to the same hospital, conducted another test, ran an X-ray -
    <br>and that's what we are seeing on the right hand side -
    <br>and found out that the boy is perfectly ok and the object is no longer there.
    <br>Mr Stephen Ogazie & Family
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>The word of advice I'm giving to the world at large and people here inside The SCOAN is that
    <br>no matter the challenges or opposition of life you are facing, not matter the temptations or tests,
    <br>God is the last bus stop. Always seek Him and believe in Him.
    <br>It is not he who wrote your first letter who will determine your final result
    <br>but He who writes your final letter will determine your final result and that person is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Indeed, Jehovah has the final say.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>I want to advise mothers that when something like this happens to you, trust in God.
    <br>God can do anything.
    <br>Even if you carry your child in your hands, please be careful to watch over your child.
    <br>That was a word of advice from Madam Gift Stephen.
    <br>Now we want to encourage the family that now the Lord has set your son free,
    <br>as the Scripture says, "As for me and my family, we will serve the Lord",
    <br>we want you and your family to go and serve the Lord in Spirit and in truth
    <br>and train the child in the way of the Lord.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will grant you and your family to grace to do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Once again shall we put our hands together for the miracle-working God.
