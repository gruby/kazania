  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer to the people in Jesus' name.
    <br>With just one touch, from the right hand of God,
    <br>the evil lurking in the lives of the people  are exposed,
    <br>forcing the evil spirits within them to manifest and confess their torment.
    <br>In the presence of God, satan and his agents of darkness have no hiding place.
    <br>This spirit is from her ancestors.
    <br>It is a curse in the whole family.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>Her business is finished.
    <br>I made her an international prostitute - she prostitutes everywhere.
    <br>For how long?
    <br>For a long time.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>I entered her from birth.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The man of God prays for her and she is set free.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>I praise You, Jesus! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Esther Nkirote Ntundu. I am from Kenya.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the spirit of prostitution
    <br>and this all started way back when a friend of mine introduced me to travel to Hong Kong.
    <br>It was in 2005.
    <br>But just to start my story from a little way - from the family.
    <br>I come from a family whereby my grandmother was a witch doctor.
    <br>And there is also a family curse in my whole family,
    <br>because there is nobody who has a job, so many people have died.
    <br>And even my mum died when I was really young.
    <br>I was 8 years old, and then I was left to care of my siblings.
    <br>So, when I went to school,
    <br>my father could not afford to pay the school fees for me.
    <br>So, first I went to seek help from a catholic priest
    <br>who saw me through secondary school.
    <br>Then after that, a friend of mine took me to the city, Nairobi
    <br>where now I got a job selling clothes in a shop.
    <br>And then now in this shop, I was introduced to this prostitution.
    <br>Because I am the first born of our family, I was taking care of my siblings
    <br>from the money I was earning when I was working in the shop selling clothes.
    <br>It was merely 50 dollars and I have three sisters who come after me.
    <br>So I had to put them in a children's home and I would send the lady, the owner of the children's home
    <br>the small money I was getting when I was working in the shop selling clothes.
    <br>So when I had this opportunity now to travel to Hong Kong, to be specific,
    <br>now another lady paid for my ticket; when I got there, I refunded her.
    <br>Are you saying that right there in Kenya, you were introduced to this prostitution,
    <br>this life of prostitution before you were invited
    <br>or encouraged to go to Hong Kong to continue that practice?
    <br>Yes, but the lady who introduced me to go to the club in Nairobi was one of the customers
    <br>who was coming to buy clothes where I was working.
    <br>Then she asked me, "Would you like to meet some white men to help you?"
    <br>First she asked me, "How much money do you get paid here?"
    <br>And I told her, "It's merely $50.00".
    <br>And then she told me, "Would you like to meet someone to help you?" I said yes.
    <br>So when she introduced me to go to the club where she was working,
    <br>I did not know what it really entailed.
    <br>When I went there, within the first two months, I met an Irish man
    <br>and I have a daughter with him.
    <br>When my daughter was born, he disappeared.
    <br>So when he disappeared, I had now to go back again on the road to try and fend for my daughter.
    <br>And still I was also looking after my sisters.
    <br>It was during this time when I met the lady who introduced me to start to travel to Hong Kong.
    <br>When I went to Hong Kong, I made money.
    <br>When I made money, I bought second-hand cars, two cars.
    <br>Then I brought them back to Kenya and I sold the cars.
    <br>When I sold the cars, I opened a saloon in a very nice area -
    <br>anybody who is here from Nairobi could know.
    <br>What you are saying, sister, is that you went, you made money through the prostitution,
    <br>thinking that you will use that money back in Kenya to start a saloon.
    <br>So when you returned and invested in the saloon, what happened to it?
    <br>I returned to Kenya and then I opened a saloon in a place called Westlands.
    <br>And the business would not pick. I operated for 2 years.
    <br>I tried my best. I ran the business for 2 years and I could not get any benefits from it.
    <br>And then eventually, it could not pay for the bills.
    <br>The saloon could not get money to pay for its bills so I had to go into the savings that I had
    <br>to pay for the rent and then eventually, I could not be able to pay and it was auctioned.
    <br>That was in 2011.
    <br>I then had to go back on the road again.
    <br>Ok, so the business you established through the money you made from prostitution,
    <br>finally the business collapsed and you now returned to Hong Kong again
    <br>to continue in that same lifestyle.
    <br>Can you just give us an idea - when you were in Hong Kong, how would go about it?
    <br>What would you do to attract customers, and what steps would you take to take money from them?
    <br>In Hong Kong, they have places where they have bars and night clubs.
    <br>Like one area, it is full of bars and night clubs.
    <br>And Hong Kong being an international destination where many people come
    <br>when there are exhibitions and big tournaments, like Rugby Sevens.
    <br>There are so many - basically, it's white people who come there.
    <br>There are ladies from everywhere in the world.
    <br>From Africa, from Colombia, from Russia, all over.
    <br>The customers then come to the bars, and they pick the ladies there.
    <br>So I did it again and then I made money in 2012.
    <br>Ok just as well, apart from just meeting these men,
    <br>collecting money from them after you slept with them -
    <br>in what other ways would you collect money from them when you were with them?
    <br>For example, when there are big tournaments, like the Rugby Sevens, it's popular there.
    <br>So there are many customers, there are many foreigners from everywhere and these are white men.
    <br>They will come and pick and then they do a lot of drugs.
    <br>They do cocaine, ice, they do all the drugs, just name it.
    <br>So when they come and they are doing the drugs, then they want to stay a longer time,
    <br>they want to party a longer time and then they want to spend more money.
    <br>So they would go to the bank, to the ATM to collect money one time, they can go two times.
    <br>If they don't want to go to the bank many times, they could even give their card
    <br>and then they would tell you to go and collect the money.
    <br>When they are drunk and when they are high, you can take advantage of them
    <br>and take more money from them.
    <br>So these men would actually give you their credit cards when they were under the influence of drugs,
    <br>give you their pin number, telling you to go and withdraw money for them.
    <br>And you will then go and take a huge amount of money,
    <br>much more than they asked and take that money for yourself.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok. So what our sister is saying is that
    <br>apart from just taking money from the men after sleeping with them,
    <br>she would also take money from their wallets when they are the influence of these drugs.
    <br>Would you sometimes encourage them to take these drugs or even give them those kind of drugs
    <br>to induce them to become high and lose reasoning so that they can give you their credit card and details?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok, and in the midst of this, when you are with these men, what would also have to take
    <br>in order for yourself also to be high to be able to engage in such practices?
    <br>I tried to take cocaine but I got very sick.
    <br>I had headache, I had running nose so I did not take it.
    <br>But I only smoke marijuana.
    <br>You were taking marijuana at that time.
    <br>Anytime you were meeting these men, you would have to be under the influence of that marijuana
    <br>to be engaging in this prostitution in Hong Kong. Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok, now apart from Hong Kong, which other countries did you travel to, to engage in this practice?
    <br>I always went to Hong Kong and Singapore.
    <br>And of course, prostitution there is illegal, so how would you go about it to hide from authorities
    <br>that they did not know you are engaging in this?
    <br>It's illegal in Hong Kong and it's illegal in Singapore.
    <br>But it's like the authorities know these things are happening
    <br>because these bars are in one place and they know these things are happening.
    <br>So what they do, they will not come and arrest you physically.
    <br>They have white men mostly from Australia and England; they pose as customers.
    <br>So they would come, dressed nicely in their suits and then they would pose as customers
    <br>and then we would talk about the price.
    <br>Once you enter into the taxi, the next destination where they stop the taxi, you would meet the Chinese people.
    <br>And then they would stop you and say, "You are under arrest, this is Hong Kong police".
    <br>So once again, we are just listening to the experiences in the life of our sister.
    <br>We heard earlier when she was under the influence of deliverance
    <br>and the spirit confessed that it pushed her into international prostitution.
    <br>Our sister is confessing how she has been involved in this prostitution across the world,
    <br>specifically in the nations of Hong Kong and Singapore.
    <br>But she is explaining that all the money she made from this prostitution
    <br>that she hoped to invest in businesses, at the end of the day, those businesses collapsed,
    <br>forcing her to return back to that same lifestyle of prostitution.
    <br>So for how many years, sister, have you been you involved in this?
    <br>When the saloon collapsed, I went back again.
    <br>Then I came back; I bought again two cars.
    <br>I saved some money, came back again to Nairobi
    <br>and opened now a shop for selling clothes.
    <br>I was not going to Hong Kong that time when the shop was going on
    <br>because I could now earn a living and have a good life.
    <br>I was always praying and trusting that God is going to sustain the business
    <br>so that I don't go back there; I never wanted to do it.
    <br>In 2011, just to take you back, I had to go through a court case
    <br>so that the father of my daughter would start to support my daughter, to pay the school fees.
    <br>So when the court intervened, they forced him to pay the school fees for my daughter.
    <br>So he was paying school fees from 2011.
    <br>My daughter goes to an international school in Kenya and the fee is expensive.
    <br>So he was paying the school fees; because we are not talking,
    <br>the lawyer gets the cheque and then the lawyer issues the cheque to me.
    <br>So we continued to pay the school fees from 2011 up to this year.
    <br>This year in January, he disappeared
    <br>and his lawyer could not get him and then there were no school fees for January.
    <br>I was running my shop and I was happy doing it.
    <br>So I was not going back.
    <br>I was going to China to collect goods and bring them to the shop.
    <br>When he ran away, and the school fees are very expensive, I went back to Hong Kong
    <br>to do prostitution to try and raise money for the school fees of my daughter.
    <br>Ok, so I hope we are hearing what our sister is saying.
    <br>Each time she attempted to stop engaging in prostitution,
    <br>problems would arise in her business
    <br>or in this case, the father of her child stopped supporting her child to go to school
    <br>and that would compel her to return back to that same lifestyle of prostitution.
    <br>Because indeed that evil spirit that was within her was the one pushing her into such a lifestyle.
    <br>So, for how many years altogether were you involved in this, madam?
    <br>The first time I went to Hong Kong was in November 2005.
    <br>So since 2005, you have been involving yourself in these actions.
    <br>And we thank God, today you here in The SCOAN and Jesus Christ has intervened in your case.
    <br>Can you tell us, sister, what led your coming here to The SCOAN?
    <br>This year, things were really bad.
    <br>When I went back to Hong Kong, I got arrested.
    <br>I got arrested because someone had planted drugs in my room.
    <br>So the police came searching for the drugs
    <br>and I did not have any drugs because I don't take drugs.
    <br>I had a customer and the customer wanted to take drugs.
    <br>I called the people who sold drugs; they brought the drugs.
    <br>So, the police came and then they knocked.
    <br>They pretended; the caretaker was the one who knocked at the room.
    <br>So when I opened the door, the police came inside and they said they had a search warrant.
    <br>They searched and then they found the drugs.
    <br>They made problems for me and put me to jail.
    <br>I stayed there for one and a half months.
    <br>But I pleaded not guilty because I did not have the drugs.
    <br>I was put on remand for one month and a half.
    <br>After that, I was taken to court; I fought the case and won the case
    <br>because surely, I did not have the drugs.
    <br>After that, everything was going very bad.
    <br>The only source of income I had was the shop back home.
    <br>This was now in September. I left Hong Kong and went to China.
    <br>I was going there to source for the stock because the shop was not stocked for quite some time.
    <br>When I was there in China, my sister texted me
    <br>and told me that the auctioneers came and took everything that was in the shop.
    <br>Then I asked her why because I did not owe anybody money.
    <br>So my sister had owed some people money way back and she had not paid it back.
    <br>She had taken the loan with the shop details and she had not told me.
    <br>So the people came looking for her and they took everything that was in the shop.
    <br>And then I was left with nothing to feed my daughter with.
    <br>Then also in the beginning of last year, things started being very difficult for me.
    <br>I was having a very nice car.
    <br>I was just driving home from the shop in the evening and then the car just burst into flames.
    <br>It burnt down completely.
    <br>Actually, it burnt down completely outside the state house, where the president lives.
    <br>So we can understand once again from our sister's experience,
    <br>this is a lesson that we believe our viewers around the world
    <br>and those present here are learning from.
    <br>Because the source of her money was unclean,
    <br>because the source of her money came through a very dubious and corrupt means,
    <br>anything she used to invest in, ended up in destruction.
    <br>As we are hearing here, the shop that she had - a huge shop - ended up being auctioned.
    <br>Even her car that she got through these illicit means, was tampered with and destroyed.
    <br>And once again, sister, we thank God that here you are today in The SCOAN.
    <br>Tell us - what happened to you last week when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.
    <br>Actually, I don't know what happened.
    <br>I was in the queue when Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying for people.
    <br>I don't know what happened. I just saw the clip now.
    <br>I just saw the person who was ahead of me, and then after that, I could  not see anything.
    <br>But after the deliverance, I thank God because I feel so much peace within me
    <br>and now I am back here in the sanctuary again.
    <br>I have this beautiful feeling, I think it is where he touched me.
    <br>It was like when you put on a rug or big skin,
    <br>and then there is that lovely sensation when you are having like muscle pain and then there is that relief.
    <br>So I had that sensation and I was not understanding it, "What is this?"
    <br>I stayed up to 1 am - that sensation was there,
    <br>I thank God I was delivered and I'm happy that this is a glorious day for me.
    <br>I hope and pray to God Almighty that my life is going to begin again, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So that spirit that propelled you into prostitution is gone, you no more have a thought of returning to it
    <br>and you are ready to start a new life now in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Amen! Glory be to God. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Now we would like to ask you, sister, - at this period you were engaging in prostitution
    <br>for the last twelve years, you said that you were an international prostitute
    <br>travelling to many countries.
    <br>At this period, were you also under the impression that maybe God was with you?
    <br>What were you doing during that period that made you feel
    <br>that perhaps God was involved in what you were doing?
    <br>Because I'm a Christian from.. I mean like I am a Christian.
    <br>You know knowing God is different because you could be going to church,
    <br>you could be praying; God watches over sinners at the same time.
    <br>So I was always praying.
    <br>And then the thing that was happening was:
    <br>I was seeing my friends getting breakthrough like they could meet men there and get married.
    <br>But I never met anybody to help to take me out of that life
    <br>and that was always my hope.
    <br>I never stopped going to church; I was always going to church.
    <br>I even bought keyboards for churches, giving to the church.
    <br>I helped the church, I paid the tithe.
    <br>All the pastors wanted was for you to give when it was necessary.
    <br>When they asked you to give, when you didn't have to give to them,
    <br>then they were angry with you.
    <br>So I have gone to churches. I did not stop praying; I have always been praying.
    <br>But I think truly now God is going to answer my prayers because I'm now delivered.
    <br>I thank the man of God for making himself available
    <br>to pray for people, and to help people like me, from all over the world.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God Almighty once again for what He has done.
    <br>I believe we have listened to our sister just now.
    <br>She said throughout this period, she was even praying.
    <br>She was even going to church,
    <br>giving offering to the church from the money she gained through prostitution,
    <br>believing that actually, she was a Christian throughout this period.
    <br>But only after her deliverance have her eyes opened to realise that she was just a church goer
    <br>and was not actually following the ways of the Lord.
    <br>Today she is delivered and this an opportunity for her to completely restart her life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>So what is your final word of advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>My final advice for viewers all over the world and especially for the ladies -
    <br>so many that I know are watching me.
    <br>Before, not now, we prayed with T.B. Joshua even before going out to meet men.
    <br>I can assure them that those prayers are not going to be answered.
    <br>I know they are watching me; they are watching me there in Hong Kong.
    <br>I'm just telling them that they should just stop that once and for all,
    <br>and turn their face fully to seek the face of God
    <br>because God is the one who provides and when you seek Him faithfully,
    <br>He will surely answer you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
