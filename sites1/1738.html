  <p>    
    <br>God Almighty continues to use the faculties of the woman of God
    <br>to break the yoke in the lives of the people,
    <br>setting them free from the bondage of satan.
    <br>As the light of God descends on this woman, she begins to manifest.
    <br>- Her marriage?
    <br>- She is destroyed.
    <br>I destroyed it - we.
    <br>She is nothing.
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>I said we are combined forces.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>What can you say about what she is saying?
    <br>She is very aggressive.
    <br>She is very aggressive and very wicked.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>From both families.
    <br>We are combined forces.
    <br>Right now, you spiritual husband - out of this body!
    <br>Out!
    <br>You unclean spirit, I command you.
    <br>You are free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>We need to congratulate this man.
    <br>You need to say sorry because if not for God, this home
    <br>would have been a broken home by now.
    <br>We need to congratulate this man.
    <br>He endured a lot of things.
    <br>You know you are delivered from this curse.
    <br>That same spirit tormenting you is in the house.
    <br>But today, you are delivered.
    <br>Today, you are free.
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>- God bless you.
    <br>Brother, congratulations, you are free.
    <br>We look forward to hear your testimony.
    <br>It is well.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Matilda.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband.
    <br>Last week, I was here with the issue of marital problem and I was delivered.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to thank God for my deliverance.
    <br>Before I came here, for seven years of our marriage we have been fighting.
    <br>I have been fighting my husband all the time.
    <br>I was like the man in the house.
    <br>I thought I was wiser than my husband.
    <br>I would always argue with him.
    <br>I was so aggressive that I would insult my husband.
    <br>I could even slap him.
    <br>There were instances where my mother in-law came to live with us.
    <br>I was so rude to her, I did not take her as my mother.
    <br>I fought her to the extent that I even insulted my mother in-law.
    <br>Then she was over seventy years old.
    <br>As a result, she left our home.
    <br>This anger increased by the day,
    <br>to the extent that when I got angry I vented my anger on my little children.
    <br>My first one is 6 and the second one is 4 years old.
    <br>I could beat them so badly.
    <br>There was a little girl that was brought to me to help us in the house.
    <br>I could beat this little girl so badly that she could get cuts on her body.
    <br>Until I saw blood on her, I would not be calm.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Things went like that.
    <br>My husband's work started to decline.
    <br>It went down and down.
    <br>Because he loves me, he put me in school.
    <br>I wasn't satisfied.
    <br>I would compare myself to my friends, my colleagues outside
    <br>because they were working.
    <br>On social media I would check their status, with photos and all that.
    <br>It would affect me.
    <br>When my husband came back from work,
    <br>instead of receiving him, I would be so angry with him and fight him.
    <br>It became an issue.
    <br>As I was saying, his work continued to go down.
    <br>Nothing progressed, to the extent that my husband could not provide for my children's school fees.
    <br>We started to beg before we ate.
    <br>Even with that, he managed to keep the home together.
    <br>It got to a point this December - we had nothing.
    <br>Our house we were living in, we owed the rent for 7 months - they sacked us.
    <br>At that point, I got angry with him again.
    <br>I was shouting at him, insulting him and he just could not take it anymore,
    <br>so he asked me to leave.
    <br>After I left, I wanted solution.
    <br>At the point in time that my husband sacked me, I did not care, I was ready to leave.
    <br>The only thing that I was thinking about was the children,
    <br>what I was going to do with them.
    <br>As time went by, January came, I was sober and I was always thinking,
    <br>reflecting on things, questioning myself if this was what I really wanted.
    <br>So I needed help.
    <br>My family members had always been intervening when issues aggravated.
    <br>Nobody was actually interested in our issues anymore.
    <br>Everybody was fed up.
    <br>So I needed help.
    <br>I went to the church asking for help.
    <br>By God's grace, I was invited to come.
    <br>When I came, that fateful Sunday,
    <br>before the woman of God got to me (she was just 2 seats away from me),
    <br>at that point I was pressed, I wanted to use the washroom.
    <br>I thought that even if I breathed I would mess myself but I decided to stay.
    <br>I was so angry with everybody around me.
    <br>I started cursing the woman of God in my heart, that this woman was just a little girl.
    <br>When she came to me and touched me, I don't know what happened.
    <br>I was saying things.
    <br>It was when I got tapped and I heard her saying, "Woman, you are free, you are delivered",
    <br>that was when I had to apologise to my husband,
    <br>that if not for God, this home would have been destroyed.
    <br>Yes, truly, it is true.
    <br>I really thank God for my deliverance and the deliverance of my marriage.
    <br>I also want to use this opportunity to ask for forgiveness from my husband
    <br>because I have caused him so much embarrassment and it has affected him.
    <br>He is no more a man.
    <br>As a man providing for the family, taking care of us, he was selfless,
    <br>he would give us everything and not buy things for himself.
    <br>After my deliverance, I have realised all this.
    <br>Before, I would justify my actions.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>But after the deliverance, you realised that there has been a being in you,
    <br>that was propelling you to do all this, that was affecting your marriage,
    <br>affecting everybody around you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is now that I realise that this demon has really destroyed me and my home.
    <br>My name is Senanu Vordzorgbe.
    <br>This is my first son.
    <br>His name means, "God is alive".
    <br>And the name of this one means, "The light of God."
    <br>I am an electrical engineer.
    <br>The woman standing on my right is my wife.
    <br>Since I have known my wife...
    <br>When I met her, she was very calm.
    <br>You can even see her - her presence alone brings peace.
    <br>So it wasn't difficult taking the decision to marry her.
    <br>Unknown to me, there were issues, as you have seen through the deliverance.
    <br>As soon as I took the decision to marry my wife,
    <br>armed robbers raided my house and stole everything away.
    <br>By then I was in the North.
    <br>We had already planned the marriage, so the marriage had to go on.
    <br>I married her; I came back from the North with nothing.
    <br>Throughout our marriage, it has been one problem or the other.
    <br>Never in my life had I been involved in an accident,
    <br>but when I took the decision to go and see her people to marry her,
    <br>on our way, our car was involved in an accident three times.
    <br>Eventually, we had to go by taxi.
    <br>We had to divide the family - they all took taxis to go to the venue.
    <br>By the time we got there, the pastors had left; they were tired and left.
    <br>Fortunately for us, we brought our own pastor.
    <br>After the marriage, I noticed that she was possessed with anger.
    <br>All she wanted to do was to deplete my funds.
    <br>She didn't want me to work.
    <br>I would be at work and she would call me that I should come home, asking
    <br>what sort of useless work I was engaged in.
    <br>I would come home and she would still be fighting me.
    <br>The marriage was like I was put in a slave ship that was heading nowhere.
    <br>Imagine being in a dark room and you don't know where you are going.
    <br>That was what it was all about.
    <br>Our first fight happened after armed robbers stole my stuff and
    <br>we had to move in with her sister, who then had a big accommodation.
    <br>My part was to provide for the entire house, including the sister, while the sister paid the rent.
    <br>I was doing that quite well.
    <br>There was an issue between me and my wife.
    <br>The mum came in and the issue aggravated.
    <br>I had to apologise to the wife.
    <br>On my way to seeing the mum, I was involved in an accident again.
    <br>Eventually, when I got to the venue, the mum and my wife's elder brother
    <br>prevented me from entering their home at 1 am.
    <br>In fact, her brother was holding a pump-action gun.
    <br>I had to sleep in a filling station with my driver.
    <br>But as a son of The SCOAN, I knew it was my duty to still apologise to the woman,
    <br>whether I had wronged her or not.
    <br>So I still went ahead to apologise to her.
    <br>We know you have so much to say,
    <br>but we just want you at this point to 'zero it down' to the impact of this spiritual husband,
    <br>this unclean spirit; the havoc this spirit has caused in your family,
    <br>and how it has affected you as a person, your children and everyone around you.
    <br>I will start with my work.
    <br>Eventually, I lost my first job.
    <br>I got consultancy work with Canadian Solar.
    <br>I think they are the second largest in the world - I was their lead consultant in Ghana,
    <br>and the project was worth 200 million dollars.
    <br>Because of our domestic issues, my wife's elder sister wrote to them,
    <br>to cancel whatever engagement they had with me.
    <br>My personal gain in that contract would have been 20 million dollars,
    <br>and I lost it unfortunately.
    <br>Moving ahead, I went for an interview with IESL - I believe it is a Nigerian company.
    <br>I was first out of about 58 engineers.
    <br>I told my wife, thinking she would be happy with me.
    <br>She got angry.
    <br>That was how I knew things were terrible.
    <br>With her mother in-law, she asked my mother to stay with us,
    <br>because I had sent her to Regional Maritime University.
    <br>In that University, we pay in dollars.
    <br>That's where she was attending school.
    <br>So she needed her mother in-law to take care of the kids while she went to school.
    <br>One day she woke up and said she didn't want to stay with us any longer.
    <br>My wife started starving the old woman.
    <br>The old woman wouldn't tell me anything; she didn't want to be the one to destroy my home.
    <br>So she would be hungry.
    <br>I would carry her in my car, going around and she would say, "Buy me a banana, buy me this, that."
    <br>She was stocking food for the week because I was not always at home.
    <br>She was always on her phone.
    <br>She didn't cook.
    <br>I have never come home to a good meal.
    <br>I always came and prepared it.
    <br>I am not a demanding husband so I didn't see it as an issue in any way.
    <br>This is how the issues affected us.
    <br>This October, unfortunately I lost my mum.
    <br>When my mum was in the morgue and I was preparing for my mum's funeral,
    <br>my wife sent a message to me saying that since I have money to bury my mother,
    <br>she is sending the younger son to the school of the older, where the fees are higher.
    <br>Since I had money to bury my mum, I should get money and pay for my kid's school fees,
    <br>which is about 1,000 dollars.
    <br>This spirit has caused a lot of havoc.
    <br>In one instance, her elder brother called me from America threatening to kill me.
    <br>True to their word, they brought an anti-terrorism squad and my wife was leading the squad.
    <br>I had a feeling that something was going to go wrong,
    <br>so I parked my car behind our house.
    <br>Her dad, a former chief of police, called me with some intelligence he had picked up, 
    <br>that if anybody knocks at my door and I open, in case I die it is my own problem - he has informed me.
    <br>Around 11 o'clock my wife called me, "Hello honey. I'm sorry.
    <br>Whatever happened, it won't happen again," and the police force was behind her.
    <br>I told her I was not at home.
    <br>She went to my friend's place, to the family house;
    <br>eventually, they didn't get me at home.
    <br>I started losing contracts, money.
    <br>I eventually sold my car just to pay her school fees.
    <br>This December we couldn't even afford rent, so they asked us to leave.
    <br>Waking up every morning to the cry of my house girl, who has become my daughter,
    <br>because she is in the same school with my kids and they call her their elder sister.
    <br>My wife would beat the girl 'black and blue'.
    <br>According to her words, she didn't want to see her in 2019.
    <br>I said, "If it is the case, we don't want to see you"
    <br>because the girl treats this kids like her sister;
    <br>she baths them, she cooks for them, she cleans the house.
    <br>"So I don't know your use. If that is the case, then you should rather leave."
    <br>So I asked her to leave.
    <br>Last week, I was home when I got a call from The SCOAN that I should be here.
    <br>You have said so much.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We thank God for what the Lord has done.
    <br>We want to hear from you - how did you feel then,
    <br>when the woman of God came, touched her and said to her that
    <br>a spiritual husband, an unclean spirit, is responsible for the problem
    <br>and the situation in the family?
    <br>How did that make you feel, as a husband?
    <br>Because you also came out and confirmed that she was very violent.
    <br>I wasn't surprised, as a son of The SCOAN.
    <br>My regret is that I thought we could do it by ourselves,
    <br>but it was bigger than us.
    <br>So I am happy that finally we made it here.
    <br>We know you have so much to tell us.
    <br>You said during that time that she was a very violent woman.
    <br>Can you just give us a little instance of how violent she has been?
    <br>There was a time I was driving on the 'speed-less' road after 10 pm.
    <br>The road was really free, so I was 'firing',
    <br>and the issue of my former driver came up.
    <br>She didn't want to hear his name, because he had even written letters saying,
    <br>"Look, I am driving your husband around Ghana and beyond to work.
    <br>He doesn't leave his hotel room."
    <br>Because of that truth, she didn't want to see the driver.
    <br>As soon as his name came up, my wife slapped me across my face.
    <br>I was driving at the speed of 100 kilometres per hour.
    <br>She started biting me.
    <br>In order to free myself I had to hit her on her thighs.
    <br>She felt the pain, before I quickly parked.
    <br>And even that was an issue - they took it to the police headquarters again.
    <br>I was at home, when the anti-terrorist and anti-trafficking unit of the Ghana Police Force called me,
    <br>saying that I was needed.
    <br>In this time, we visited police station 4 times.
    <br>They always asked her to apologise to me.
    <br>There was one instance she told me that people were raising money for her
    <br>to put me behind bars,
    <br>and since that didn't materialise, I should give her the money to pay to the people.
    <br>To have peace, I gave her the money to pay them.
    <br>Wow. We thank God for what the Lord has done.
    <br>What can you tell us that you have noticed in the life of your wife after her deliverance
    <br>on Sunday - because you witnessed the deliverance.
    <br>What changes have you noticed in her?
    <br>I noticed her peace is back.
    <br>She used to be a chorister, when she was at school, very dedicated at what she did.
    <br>As I said earlier; anytime she is around, there is peace.
    <br>I noticed her peace is back.
    <br>Initially, I didn't want to get closer to her, even after she was delivered.
    <br>Throughout the week, I didn't want to have anything to do with her.
    <br>But gradually, I noticed her peace is back.
    <br>Initially she was coming to look for me, but now I go to look for her.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to beg my husband.
    <br>We are seeing reconciliation taking place in this family after the deliverance
    <br>that took place here, at The SCOAN last Sunday, by the woman of God.
    <br>We have listened to the woman sharing her experience
    <br>how that spiritual husband, the spirit of anger
    <br>had wreaked so much havoc in the family,
    <br>and the marriage was at the verge of divorce,
    <br>before this divine intervention of God Almighty.
    <br>Let us hear from you.
    <br>After the deliverance, what changes have you noticed in your life?
    <br>The first experience is peace.
    <br>I have peace of heart.
    <br>I was always thinking, worried - unnecessary things.
    <br>Now I am able to see my husband as my husband.
    <br>I am proud to be married to him.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>For my kids too - I have a renewal of love for them.
    <br>Initially, I could just blame them for everything.
    <br>I just blamed everybody for what was happening to me.
    <br>I want to thank God for the deliverance.
    <br>I also want to use this opportunity to thank the man of God for this opportunity, for accepting me.
    <br>Tell us, with the deliverance we have seen,
    <br>that God used the woman of God to achieve in your life,
    <br>and what has happened in your life before the deliverance;
    <br>what word of advice do you have for people listening to you,
    <br>most especially couples, that may be having a similar situation that you were in before the deliverance?
    <br>First of all, I want to say that when you are seated during prayers, deliverance session,
    <br>whatever you are feeling, whether you are pressed to go to the washroom,
    <br>please, be calm and be seated - it is the trap of the devil.
    <br>If you move, you might miss your chance of being delivered.
    <br>Secondly, I would also want to use this opportunity to advise young ladies like me.
    <br>Please, be patient in your marriage, be prayerful.
    <br>Whatever you are facing; maybe you are having challenges in you marriage -
    <br>divorce is not the ultimate.
    <br>Please, seek the face of God.
    <br>Be humble to your husband and put everything in prayer.
    <br>Don't go to friends, family, don't compare your lives to what you see on social media.
    <br>It is just a distraction.
    <br>Stay focused on God and He will help you through your marriage.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Thank you for your word of advice.
    <br>Let us hear from your husband.
    <br>What word of advice do you have for couples?
    <br>My advice to couples is that they should stick to the Bible.
    <br>Recently, you see couples on social media, displaying laughter, going around kissing each other.
    <br>I don't believe that is love.
    <br>When I was growing up, my mum used to tell me that
    <br>if you want to do anything for somebody, you have to do it behind the person.
    <br>For example: I see Prophet T.B. Joshua coming and I start cleaning this place
    <br>because I want to be noticed - no.
    <br>You have to do it while he is not around.
    <br>That is true love.
    <br>Love is not for Instagram, where you sit and say, "I love my wife" - no.
    <br>You have to do it, you have to act it, it is a 'doing' word.
