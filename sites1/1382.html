    <br>My name is Ramsey Hammed Odhiambo.
    <br>My problem is avascular necrosis of the hip.
    <br>I have been using these crutches for four years.
    <br>I can't play with my friends at school.
    <br>I want to walk by myself.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help my son.
    <br>What happened to your child?
    <br>He has avascular necrosis of the hip.
    <br>How are you? What's your name?
    <br>Ramsey Hammed Odhiambo.

    <br>Little boy, this is your mum?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Who is Jesus?
    <br>Jesus is the Son of God.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, my son is healed!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Christine Zennah Kierai.
    <br>The boy beside me is my son, Ramsey.
    <br>The baby here is my baby girl.
    <br>We are from Kenya.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the illness of my son.
    <br>He had been suffering for four years with an incurable disease.
    <br>He had difficulty in breathing, chest pain, back pain and the disease even affected the hip.
    <br>So, he used to support himself, using crutches.
    <br>He couldn't play with his friends at school.
    <br>He used to skip school; he would normally go to school twice a week.
    <br>I knew that by coming here, he would receive his healing and deliverance.
    <br>When we were in Kenya, we went to several hospitals but all was in vain.
    <br>The last time I was in the hospital, he was given painkillers and was also booked for an operation.
    <br>Most of the time, I was the one supporting him.
    <br>For how long had he been using the crutches?
    <br>For four years.
    <br>It had affected him mentally and spiritually
    <br>and even in his education, he wasn't performing well.
    <br>When I saw the man of God approaching us, I was shocked and started shivering.
    <br>Then, the man of God laid his hands on my son, meditating and praying.
    <br>Instantly, my son stood up and started walking!

    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>In fact, the pain he was feeling on his chest and back, disappeared immediately.
    <br>He can now walk without crutches, bathe, eat and do everything by himself.
    <br>So you don't need to help him anymore?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!

    <br>My name is Ramsey Hammed Odhiambo.
    <br>I am 9 years old.
    <br>I am from Kenya.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was avascular necrosis disease,
    <br>which affected my hip bone.
    <br>I couldn't walk by myself; I used crutches.
    <br>I couldn't play with my friends at school or at home.
    <br>My mum used to lock me inside so that I could rest.
    <br>Last week on Sunday, the man of God laid hands on me
    <br>and I suddenly felt something moving in my body.
    <br>I received my healing immediately!

    <br>And today, to the glory of God, Ramsey can walk.
    <br>Can you walk in the midst of the children of God to see how you are doing today.
    <br>Healed Of Avascular Necrosis Of The Hip
    <br>No Longer Using Crutches
    <br>Yes, we can see the little brother walking for the first time in four years.
    <br>Since the man of God prayed for him, the Lord has transformed him.
    <br>Today, he is standing to the glory of God to share his wonderful testimony
    <br>of how God Almighty has wiped away the tears of the family.
    <br>Believe in God and He will fulfill your dream.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Believe in God and He will fulfill your dream.
    <br>Just as the Lord has done in the life of this little brother,
    <br>He will do it for you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You should have faith and wait upon the Lord because with God, everything is possible.
