    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER
    <br>GOD IS MORE MAJESTIC AT DISTANCE
    <br>GOD IS MORE POWERFUL AT DISTANCE
    <br>BECAUSE GOD IS SPIRIT
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>It has been quite some time.
    <br>I took a resting time.
    <br>Resting time is time to receive from God.
    <br>Working time is time to give what we receive from God.
    <br>This is a difficult time where every day is filled with uncertainty.
    <br>These are some of the places I spend my time to receive the message you are about to hear right now.
    <br>PRAYER MOUNTAIN
    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER
    <br>GOD IS MORE MAJESTIC AT DISTANCE
    <br>GOD IS MORE POWERFUL AT DISTANCE
    <br>BECAUSE GOD IS SPIRIT
    <br>This message is important for your focus.
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Feed us, Lord, from Your Word that we may know You.
    <br>Your Word is truth.
    <br>Your Word is light.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Viewers, our first reading shall be taken from the Book of 2 Corinthians 12.
    <br>We start our reading from verse 1.
    <br>Our proof reading - verse 10.
    <br>The Book of Proverbs 24:16.
    <br>The Book of Numbers 13:31-33.
    <br>The Book of Joshua 1:5-9.
    <br>The Book of Colossians 1:15-21.
    <br>The Book of Psalms 119:67.
    <br>Let's take our reading.
    <br>2 Corinthians 12:1:
    <br>"It is necessary to boast; nothing is to be gained by it, but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
    <br>I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven -
    <br>whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows.
    <br>And I know that such a person - whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God knows..."
    <br>Let me take you to verse 9:
    <br>"But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness.'
    <br>So, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
    <br>Therefore I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities
    <br>for the sake of Christ; for whenever I am weak, then I am strong."
    <br>MISTAKES ARE CORRECTABLE
    <br>What is a mistake?
    <br>It is an act or judgement that is wrong.
    <br>We wake up in the morning determined to get it right.
    <br>Before we know it, we have missed the mark.
    <br>Making a mistake is not the issue
    <br>but how we handle it matters.
    <br>For instance, the issue of the sickness is a mistake.
    <br>However, how we are handling it has led us to where we are today.
    <br>Where are we today?
    <br>We are surrounded by uncertainty - the twists and turns of life.
    <br>Economic oppression - poverty everywhere.
    <br>Physical oppression - sickness, disease everywhere; fear and panic everywhere.
    <br>No one is above mistakes.
    <br>You cannot live a proper life without making mistakes -
    <br>life worth to emulate.
    <br>If you make a mistake, as we all do sometimes, don't run from God; run to Him.
    <br>If you must get to your goal, there must be a time to cry,
    <br>a time to lament, a time to complain and a time to be happy.
    <br>The mistakes make Christian life more interesting and more valuable.
    <br>The mistakes will continue to draw us closer to God
    <br>and make us pay attention to Him.
    <br>The Book of Numbers 13:31-33 and Joshua 1:5-9;
    <br>God knew that the biggest enemy Joshua would face would not be the giant in the land
    <br>but the little voice inside saying, "Whom do you think you are? You are not able!"
    <br>In the same vein, our biggest enemy in not the problem we are facing.
    <br>Our biggest enemy is not the challenges we are facing but the little voice inside driving us,
    <br>saying, "You can do this, you can do that and get away with it.
    <br>You can kill, destroy and steal and get away with it - you are different." But we are not.
    <br>We all have feet of clay to some extent.
    <br>All of us have made mistakes at one time or another
    <br>and some of us are in the middle of a high-risk mistake right now.
    <br>We made the call - and all of us have made the bad call in some areas of our lives.
    <br>Viewers, when we connect with Jesus genuinely by way of a personal relationship,
    <br>He will walk you through everything you do.
    <br>You know there are many wrong connections.
    <br>When one is born again, when one becomes a Christian
    <br>without the Spirit of God, this is a dangerous mission.
    <br>When we are well connected, the Word and the Spirit must join together.
    <br>I mean, God's power working through His Word and His Spirit to bring about the new birth.
    <br>When you did not know Him, you were influenced by your own decisions
    <br>and by the pressure that comes from others.
    <br>When we accept Him genuinely, we would be different.
    <br>His decision on our lives would guide us.
    <br>All of us fight similar battles
    <br>but they are just camouflaged differently.
    <br>Viewers, in the 1 Corinthians 10:13:
    <br>When we rely on the strength that comes from Jesus,
    <br>He will not allow the enemy of our soul to give us more than what we can take.
    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER
    <br>GOD IS MORE MAJESTIC AT DISTANCE
    <br>GOD IS MORE POWERFUL AT DISTANCE
    <br>BECAUSE GOD IS SPIRIT
    <br>Viewers, let us pray.
    <br>Our heart is the prayer room.
    <br>I need your heart.
    <br>I need your attention.
    <br>Prayer is the key
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Jesus started with prayer and ended with prayer
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Lord Jesus, by the power of Your Holy Spirit, enable us to be made whole,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>We come with our emptiness that we may be filled.
    <br>We come with our weakness to receive Your strength.
    <br>We come with darkness, seeking Your light.
    <br>Never a sickness, never a disease Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
