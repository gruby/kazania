  <p>    
    <br>As the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua descended from the altar
    <br>to minister prayer to the congregation, the fire of the Holy Spirit erupted on the scene.
    <br>There was nowhere to hide and nowhere to run from  the light of God which searched out
    <br>every shade of darkness and affliction, dispelling them with just a touch from God's anointed servant.
    <br>Arrested by the power of God, the evil spirits confess their wicked deeds
    <br>before being cast out of people's lives across the arena of liberty.
    <br>As the ministration continued, this crippled man began to cry out.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me. I can't walk; I am having difficulty in walking.
    <br>I use a walking aid to walk.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me - I'm booked for two more surgeries.
    <br>I had surgery on my back and I am booked for two more on my cervical and thoracic.
    <br>And from my waist downwards is dead. I don't have any feelings at all.
    <br>I am wearing a knee brace to help me to walk and a lumbar corset to help me sit up straight.
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prayer and Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>Guided by the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the man in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I have no feelings from my waist downward.
    <br>The lightning of God pours through the man of God as he prays into the man's injured leg
    <br>which begins to lift off the ground and shake uncontrollably as the Spirit of God
    <br>strikes the root of the pain and brings instant healing in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Walk!
    <br>Thank God! Thank You, Lord! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am so happy!
    <br>Oh my God! Lord, thank You! I can walk!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Charles Ude. I am a Nigerian living in the United States.
    <br>Thank you, sir. Who is the gentleman standing next to you?
    <br>The next person that is standing next to me is my brother Bernet Ude Eze.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of difficulty in walking.
    <br>I had numbness of my leg and that is where it started.
    <br>It came from my waist down. It was numb.
    <br>I had surgery on my back because of trying to alleviate the problem
    <br>but it didn't work so I tried everything; it was not working.
    <br>I was using a lumbar corset to sit up straight and a knee brace to help me.
    <br>Ok, sir, tell us - how has this problem of numbness and difficulty in walking affected your life in all areas?
    <br>It affected my life in everything I do in life.
    <br>As a human being, I just couldn't do anything for myself because of that.
    <br>It's just like from here alive and this part dead.
    <br>So it was very bad and difficult for me.
    <br>So truly this problem had crippled you in a very real sense.
    <br>Yes, it did.
    <br>Ok, so tell us about your career - how was that impacted?
    <br>I had stopped working because I couldn't do anything. I was working in the nursing field.
    <br>But because of that, I stopped working; for two and a half years, I couldn't do anything.
    <br>Just to get better, I was using my vacation hours to get paid till it got depleted.
    <br>Then I stopped working completely; then, I went for surgery.
    <br>During that time, how would you move around if you needed to go out,
    <br>go to a hospital or go to different places?
    <br>With the help of my wife and some friends sometimes too and a walking aid to move around.
    <br>They even gave me a sticker.
    <br>They gave me a sticker to be moving around.
    <br>But before that time, I was using the Anointing Water my brother sent to me.
    <br>Before that time, before the Anointing Water came...
    <br>The first one was sent to me, the pastor where I was worshipping told me,
    <br>"It is not good; don't use it".
    <br>He kept on telling me to bring it so that we could destroy it.
    <br>After a long time, I brought it.
    <br>When I brought it out, he then lit it up to burn it.
    <br>It was burning.
    <br>The water was not putting out the fire as supposed to
    <br>but rather it was burning like a spirit with the fire.
    <br>And I got scared, and I saw the power of what was being destroyed.
    <br>I prayed to God, "Please, God, forgive me for what I have done.
    <br>I don't know what I did. Forgive me" and then it burnt completely.
    <br>Wow. So I hope we have all understood what our brother is explaining
    <br>of how during the course of this problem where he was unable to walk
    <br>without the assistance of a walker and without people carrying him at home,
    <br>our brother standing next to him, the pastor send the Morning Water
    <br>which he had received here at The SCOAN to our brother to be using for his situation.
    <br>However, he was discouraged from using the Morning Water by his pastor
    <br>back in his country, in the United States that it was not a good thing to use
    <br>and when he was eventually deceived into bringing the Morning Water to be destroyed,
    <br>instead of when you put fire on the water for it to be quenched, it started burning
    <br>as if it was not water inside but instead he saw the power of the Holy Spirit as it was going.
    <br>And that convinced him, and that touched his heart to say, "Oh my goodness, I made a big mistake.
    <br>I have destroyed a gift of God that God had given to me".
    <br>So what happened after then?
    <br>So then he send me another one that I was using.
    <br>When I started using it, that's when I was able to move around better than I was doing before
    <br>and was able to come down here to seek for the face of the Lord.
    <br>So just that we can really understand, sir: Describe how you were that time
    <br>when your brother send the Morning Water to you before you were able to come to the SCOAN.
    <br>How would you move around? How was daily life?
    <br>I couldn't move, I couldn't do anything.
    <br>I couldn't move without any help unless with my walking aid, knee brace and lumbar corset.
    <br>That helped me to move - my walking aid.
    <br>Ok. When your brother send the Morning Water and you were able to start using it,
    <br>what were the changes you started seeing?
    <br>I started having some feelings - a little bit, to move around.
    <br>I could get up after I started ministering the Morning Water.
    <br>And then I could feel my legs sometimes - trembling a little bit so feelings started coming.
    <br>Then, my feet used to burn when I put them on the ground; they used to burn like fire.
    <br>And then there was none, it got better.
    <br>So it helped me a little bit to come down here.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Charles Ude & Brother
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Before we get further, sir, we can see some items on the board there.
    <br>Can you tell us what these items are and what they were for.
    <br>This on the board here was a handicap sticker that was given to me by the doctors
    <br>because they tested my nerves and everything and said I was severely damaged.
    <br>Then they gave me this to help me to get closer to the buildings to where I was going.
    <br>So when I parked on handicap places, I wouldn't have to walk very far to the buildings.
    <br>So this is a sticker only given to people who are diagnosed as handicapped by hospitals.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>In order to assist them around the city, to park their car or to be able to move in preference areas.
    <br>Exactly; it is true.
    <br>Alright and what is the other document?
    <br>Now this one here: They booked me for tumor abrasions, for my cervical and thoracic for surgery.
    <br>Then I said no.
    <br>Then my brother said, "No, don't do anymore surgeries".
    <br>Before anymore surgeries, I should come back here and seek the face of the Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah! And indeed, we did see you come to The SCOAN last week.
    <br>So tell us: What was your experience when the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>was moving through the congregation?
    <br>Please take time and describe to us when he prayed for you, what was your experience?
    <br>He was moving around and I was calling on him to come.
    <br>When he finally came to me, he tapped me on the head.
    <br>I felt like a shock all over my body and then my body felt light.
    <br>And then from my leg - I started having feelings.
    <br>Then he started praying for my leg, for the healing.
    <br>My leg was kind of moving and then he told me to get up.
    <br>When I got up, he then tapped me on the back and he said, "Walk".
    <br>I couldn't believe it.
    <br>But when I took my first step, second one, I said, "Wow"; I was doing it.
    <br>Then I said, "Thank You, Jesus, I am healed". I have been walking ever since then.
    <br>I have not taken any medication since that day up till now.
    <br>Then, I took medications three times a day. I have not touched them at all.
    <br>Come on, put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>If you know that Jesus Christ is going to touch your case just like he touched our brother's life,
    <br>let's see your excitement!
    <br>So in just that moment, as we are seeing on the screen right now,
    <br>we can see the very encounter when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for our brother
    <br>told him to stand up, tapped him and said, "Walk".
    <br>And there he is walking to the glory of God.
    <br>So tell us, at that exact moment, when the man of God touched you and loosed the lumbar corset,
    <br>and loosed the knee brace, what were you feeling in your leg, feeling in your body?
    <br>I started having some feelings going down my legs.
    <br>When I touched my legs, I could feel it. Before, I couldn't feel anything.
    <br>My children used to stamp on my feet to put life in them.
    <br>I didn't feel anything then, no feeling but now, I can feel stuff.
    <br>Wow! And then when the man of God now prayed for your leg and it started shaking and moving,
    <br>Were you able to move your leg like that before?
    <br>No, never. I couldn't even lift my leg one inch off the ground but I can do this now.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So you mean it was impossible for you to be moving your legs like this, sir, before the prayer?
    <br>I couldn't do it. One inch off the ground, I could not lift.
    <br>It would be like I was lifting 10 bags of cement.
    <br>Wow! And now here you are exercising.
    <br>We want to also ask you, sir, to do some exercises right now, to stand up and walk
    <br>and show the people of God what you can do after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Charles Ude & Brother
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>There he goes marching like a soldier; you can see him walking easily now.
    <br>This is what was impossible for him to do for the past several years
    <br>because of this problem of numbness, and pain from the waist
    <br>that had caused him to be bed ridden, giving him severe difficulty in walking.
    <br>Sir, as you are moving around, as you are walking,
    <br>how are you feeling? Is there any pain or problem?
    <br>Not really, no. It feels great walking around.
    <br>You are healed.
    <br>Yes, I am healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah! We want to hear a word of advice from you in a moment but before then,
    <br>we would like to hear from the gentleman that came with you.
    <br>Si,r you are welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Please introduce yourself to us and the congregation.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Brethren, my name is Pastor Ben Eze Udeze.
    <br>I'm from Enungu, Nigeria.
    <br>The Founder of Calvary Love Ministry.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Charlie is my brother; he called me and told me that he wasn't feeling fine.
    <br>I said, "Wow, what's the problem?"
    <br>He said his leg could not raise up and he would undergo surgery.
    <br>I asked, "Surgery?" and he said, "Yes".
    <br>I said, "Okay".
    <br>The US is far different from Nigeria.
    <br>I told him I would go and talk to my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and truly, I came here and received the Morning Water.
    <br>I sent it to him; praise the Lord!
    <br>When I sent the first one to him, he said that the pastor of the church he was attending
    <br>told him to bring the Morning Water to him, that it is not of God.
    <br>Then, he gave it to him and he set it on fire.
    <br>And the thing could not burn.
    <br>They thought that the water would quench the fire but it failed.
    <br>What he saw there was that the water was working as if there was something on it - Spirit.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Then, that one was gone just like that.
    <br>Then after that, I sent him another one.
    <br>That one enabled him to come out of pain.
    <br>Then I told him that it was high time he came back to Nigeria,
    <br>that he wouldn't need surgery anymore because we have a fire house in Nigeria.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So this was what convinced your brother that "Oh, this was a mistake!
    <br>What I actually needed is what I have now destroyed". Is that right?
    <br>Yes, that propelled me to give him another one.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Pastor Ben Eze Udeze & Brother
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>I told him to come down and he came.
    <br>I told him, "Let's go to the House of God", and he followed me just like that.
    <br>We came here and the man of God touched him.
    <br>Death left him; life entered automatically.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Life entered automatically.
    <br>There is God here.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You are seeing on the screen right now the very moment
    <br>where Prophet T.B. Joshua touched our brother in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>and the life of God began to enter every part of his system
    <br>that had been dead, damaged and dormant and there he is walking for the glory of God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus once again!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So since then, sir, what have been the changes you have noticed in our brother.
    <br>My brother has been walking with me.
    <br>When we entered the plane to come here, I was not happy, seeing him with a crutch
    <br>but now, I am smiling; I am feeling free.
    <br>I have confidence because I came to the mountain of God, not mountain of man.
    <br>The mountain of man faileth but the mountain of God stands sure.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, sir, now seeing what God Almighty has done in the life of your brother,
    <br>what is your word of advice to people watching all over the world?
    <br>Wow! People of God, the whole world watching me right now,
    <br>I say, let us go to the House of God.
    <br>Let us go; forget about the protocols you have or problem you may have.
    <br>The solution is here in the arena of liberty; let's go!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>A wonderful word of advice that no matter what problem you have,
    <br>the solution is only with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
    <br>who works in every one of his living churches all over the world.
    <br>So make sure you find a living church and run to God whenever you have a problem,
    <br>instead of running from Him. Let's put our hands together for Jesus once again!
    <br>Lastly, we want to hear a word of advice from our brother who received his wonderful healing today.
    <br>Sir, tell us your advice to people watching all over the world.
    <br>People of God, whatever problem you have, my advice is:
    <br>Whatever problem you are having in this world, no matter what it is,
    <br>don't run from God, run to Him; there is solution there.
    <br>Regardless of what it is, whatever you are going through,
    <br>run to God, don't run away from Him.
    <br>Running away from Him is the biggest mistake you make in your life.
    <br>That's what I have to say.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>A sound word of advice and, sir, we thank God Almighty for this wonderful healing you have received
    <br>and we encourage you: You have been healed through the Word of God.
    <br>So continue to make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>and this healing shall remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Two weeks after his healing, Mr Ude is not only strong physically but spiritually as well.
    <br>Before going back to the US, to his surprise,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua supports Mr Ude with a financial gift as well.
    <br>Let's watch.
    <br>My name is Charles Ude. I am a Nigerian living in USA.
    <br>Thank you, sir, and who is the gentleman standing next to you?
    <br>That is my brother Bennett Eze.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of difficulty in walking.
    <br>Then, I had a lumbar corset I was using that helped me sit up straight, stand up straight
    <br>and do a lot of stuff that I couldn't do well.
    <br>Even though I was wearing it, it was not helping me.
    <br>I was wearing a knee brace.
    <br>I used to have a walking aid to help me move around a little bit.
    <br>The problem affected my daily life so much that I could not do anything.
    <br>I had two little children - 5 and 3.
    <br>I couldn't even play with them. I couldn't even teach them how to ride bikes.
    <br>I could not do anything for them
    <br>and the children didn't understand what was going on with daddy.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me and prayed for me,
    <br>I was able to get up and started walking.
    <br>Ever since then, I have been walking and walking around.
    <br>I never want to stop walking around because it is something that I never thought I could...
    <br>The devil would deny me walking.
    <br>But now through the help of the man of God, I have been healed and walking around.
    <br>Glory be to God. I thank God for using the man of God to help me.
    <br>Amen! To God be the glory. So since the man of God has prayed for you,
    <br>how many days has it been and what are the changes you have seen?
    <br>It's going to two weeks now.
    <br>The changes have been tremendous.
    <br>I just can't explain; there are no words to explain the entire changes,
    <br>that I have been getting from this - the happiness, everything about it.
    <br>Even people that know me, when they see me, they say, "Oh your face is glowing right now..
    <br>It's just too much. It's unimaginable.
    <br>I'm so happy about it.
    <br>Wow! To God be the glory!
    <br>Well, that's it. The Bible promises us that the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed
    <br>and you are telling us your life has changed to the glory of God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Pastor Ben Eze.
    <br>Before, he could not walk but since he came here, after the man of God touched him,
    <br>healing entered, life entered and now, he has started walking.
    <br>He can walk with me; we have stayed here almost two weeks and he has been walking.
    <br>I feel happy; I feel joy. Glory be to God!
    <br>Amen! And as a minister of the Gospel, how has this impacted on your faith,
    <br>seeing what God has done to someone close to you?
    <br>Beautiful! It has encouraged me that walking in the way of God is the most important thing.
    <br>God called me but it is not like this; I am seeing this, it has propelled me high
    <br>with the hope that God has something to do with me tomorrow.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank you very much, sir.
    <br>And lastly, what is your word of advice to people watching all over the world
    <br>who are in a position you were in, to be of help and assistance to someone in need?
    <br>I have friends outside and inside - I have been calling them, telling them that they should come.
    <br>There is power in the house.
    <br>I told a lot of them, "Let us go to Emmanuel TV - there is something happening,
    <br>miracles are happening and you can see God in His nature here".
    <br>Praise the Lord! Let us go; it is good. Amen.
    <br>Amen! Thank you very much. What a wonderful comment, sir.
    <br>So let's hear from our brother once again. Mr Charles.
    <br>His word of advice to people all over the world
    <br>who has seen what the power of God has done in his life.
    <br>My advice is: No matter what you are going through, look for the face of God.
    <br>Disregard what people are saying about the face of God,
    <br>especially Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>That man is a lion.
    <br>That man - God uses him in so many ways;
    <br>in so many ways that you can't even imagine.
    <br>He is in everything, helping everybody.
    <br>He doesn't care how big you are or how small you are.
    <br>He sees everybody equal.
    <br>The man is great.
    <br>I thank God and my advice is: Whatever you are going through, look for the face of God.
    <br>What is your plan for the future? What is the next step for you?
    <br>My plan is to go back to the USA where I came down from and continue from where I left off.
    <br>And with the prayers the man of God has given me,
    <br>I believe he has opened all the doors of greatness for me.
    <br>So I know the sky is my limit right now.
    <br>I know that progress won't stop coming.
    <br>It's going to be coming from everywhere, from all angles, in Jesus' name.
    <br>It is our pleasure to present you on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>the sum of N150 000 as financial support and a copy of The Mirror.
    <br>Wow! Thank God and I thank God for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I came to get healing, I got healing.
    <br>Not only did I get healing, I also got financial support to support me.
    <br>God is great and I pray to God to continue to use Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to help so many people and touch so many lives and change so many lives all over the world.
    <br>And Emmanuel TV Partners to continue to do the good work they do.
    <br>God uses them in so many ways regardless of who you are.
    <br>I thank God and I thank Emmanuel TV for everything they have done for me.
    <br>He healed me and then he also gave me financial support.
    <br>To God be the glory. Amen!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
