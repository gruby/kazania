    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>This young man has come to The SCOAN today with a   horrifying affliction - fire burns.
    <br>THE MAN WHO WAS BURNED ALIVE!!! ðŸ”¥
    <br>Mark 9:23-24:
    <br>" 'If you can', said Jesus, 'Everything is possible to him who believes'.
    <br>Immediately, the boys father exclaimed, 'I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief.' "
    <br>THE MAN WHO WAS BURNED ALIVE!!! ðŸ”¥
    <br>My name is Makanjuola Ademoyegun. I am 26 years old.
    <br>The problem that brought me here is fire burns.
    <br>It all started one night. I and my fiancee were inside.
    <br>We have been having some little problems, although there is love between us.
    <br>We actually love each other.
    <br>One night I discovered that having misunderstanding every time
    <br>without understanding each other, we should decide to quit.
    <br>I just wanted to see how much she loved me and how much I loved her.
    <br>So she decided that she is not quitting the relationship with me.
    <br>After the argument, I don't know how she came about petrol.
    <br>She brought in petrol, poured some on me and some on herself.
    <br>Instead of the two of us to quit the relationship, we would rather die together.
    <br>She set herself ablaze.
    <br>In the process of rescuing her, I was in contact with petrol too.
    <br>So, I was actually burnt as well.
    <br>It has been very terrible.
    <br>I have been having severe pain, sleepless nights, all over my body.
    <br>I was taken to LUTH - Lagos State University Teaching Hospital,
    <br>where I have been treated.
    <br>Since then the problem still persists because of the pain.
    <br>I believe today that God is going to heal me.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Makanjuola Ademoyegun is seen here waiting in faith, at The SCOAN prayer line
    <br>for a healing touch from Jesus Christ.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>THE MAN WHO WAS BURNED ALIVE!!! ðŸ”¥
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>This is a section of those with bodily afflictions and you can see that brother
    <br>in terrible pain and agony, due to fire burns.
    <br>That is the prayer line section of The SCOAN.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank you; you are free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>A few months after he was prayed for at The SCOAN by Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>over the problem of fire burns, Mr Makanjuola Ademoyegun came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to testify that he is healed and Jesus Christ is his Healer.
    <br>BEFORE | NOW
    <br>No pain.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>THE MAN WHO WAS BURNED ALIVE!!! ðŸ”¥
    <br>NOW | BEFORE
    <br>My name is Makanjuola Ademoyegun.
    <br>The incident happened in 2007.
    <br>I was in the house with my fiancÃ©e.
    <br>Actually we had been having some misunderstanding in our relationship,
    <br>so I told her that it was better we resolve this issue once and for all or we go our separate ways.
    <br>I took it lightly with her but I never knew she did not.
    <br>I was lying down in the sitting room.
    <br>She went out and poured fuel into a paint bucket.
    <br>She brought it inside the sitting room, poured some on me and some on herself.
    <br>Before I could stop her, she lit the fire.
    <br>We were both set ablaze.
    <br>So, the neighbours came in when they heard noise.
    <br>They rescued the two of us.
    <br>They extinguished the fire and we were rushed to the general hospital.
    <br>Some few days later, she gave up.
    <br>After two or three weeks, my aunty came to the hospital and saw my condition
    <br>and she said it is better to take me to The Synagogue for the pastor to pray for me
    <br>rather than wasting money at the general hospital.
    <br>So, I was brought down to The SCOAN and the pastor prayed for me that day.
    <br>There was a lot of pain all over my body.
    <br>In fact, I cannot really define the type of pain I was going through that time.
    <br>I could not even stand upright but when the pastor prayed for me,
    <br>I felt relief from the inside of me and the pain was gone.
    <br>I started receiving strength and the wounds were healing.
    <br>Here I am today, giving thanks to God Almighty.
    <br>THE MAN WHO WAS BURNED ALIVE!!! ðŸ”¥
    <br>Having shared his testimony and walked among the people,
    <br>he puts on his clothes to demonstrate to the congregation
    <br>that Jesus Christ has put an end to the problem of fire burns in his life.
    <br>To God be the glory.
