  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We need no more than to open our eyes of faith.
    <br>Once the eyes of faith are open,
    <br>you fear no more,
    <br>you complain no more.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- [Amen!]
    <br>Now, you know the power you are under.
    <br>Let me see your hand, if you know the power you are under.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- [Amen!]
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>[Nowhere.]
    <br>Stretch your hand and pray for the viewers because already you are blessed.
    <br>We pray the Lord will open the eyes of your faith, so you fear no more,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- [Amen!]
    <br>Open your books to the Book of Proverbs 13:20.
    <br>"He who walks with wise men will be wise,
    <br>but the company of fools will be destroyed."
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- [Amen!]
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>Those that would be good must keep good company.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Those that would be good must keep good company."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Those that would be good must keep good company.]
    <br>Read along with me.
    <br>"He who walks with wise men will be wise,
    <br>but the company of fools will be destroyed."
    <br>Those that would be wise,
    <br>those that would be good, must keep good company.
    <br>Men's character is known by the company they keep.
    <br>The need for a mentor.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The need for a mentor.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[The need for a mentor.]
    <br>The need for a coach.
    <br>The need for a mentor.
    <br>What is a mentor?
    <br>A mentor is someone with vast experience or unique talent
    <br>who is willing to share with you on a regular basis.
    <br>Not greedy one, not selfish one, who is willing to share with you on a regular basis.
    <br>Nothing is too big or too small.
    <br>No matter how small it is, he is ready to give out of it.
    <br>"Oh, this thing is too small, no."
    <br>He wants to see people succeed with their lives.
    <br>When people are happy, he's happy.
    <br>The wound of others is the wound of all.
    <br>The pain of others is the pain of all.
    <br>That is a mentor.
    <br>It is like a teacher-student relationship
    <br>except that you have the benefit of one on one tutoring.
    <br>And the big bonus - you normally don't pay for the lesson,
    <br>for the lecture,
    <br>for the effort you receive.
    <br>You normally don't pay for it.
    <br>What a deal!
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>What a deal!
    <br>For one to receive lecture, encouragement, wisdom, knowledge and you don't pay for it!
    <br>Free - because it is grace.
    <br>Freely we receive and freely we give.
    <br>It is different from when one wants to go to theology school - you have to pay for school fee,
    <br>you have to do this, that.
    <br>But this is the big bonus; normally you don't pay for the lesson.
    <br>To enjoy your mentor, the most important thing is to be sincere.
    <br>Sincerity goes a long way to get you what you want in life.
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>If you are not sincere to your mentor, you cannot receive anything.
    <br>No matter how many years you spend with him.
    <br>You will go the same way you came.
    <br>Let's take look at the Book of Ephesians 5:1,6,7.
    <br>"Therefore be imitators of God as dear children.
    <br>Let no man deceive you with empty words, for because of these things
    <br>the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
    <br>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.
    <br>Walk as children of light.
    <br>... finding out what is acceptable to the Lord."
    <br>When you go by that Book of Proverbs;
    <br>many have fallen because of being influenced
    <br>by people who set a bad example.
    <br>We don't need to remind ourselves of the young ones
    <br>who have been affected by the failure of their parents
    <br>or the company that has been severely injured
    <br>by the mismanagement of the CEO.
    <br>It is all around us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[It is all around us.]
    <br>Again.
    <br>[It is all around us.]
    <br>When you look right or left - you see, it is all around us.
    <br>How many of those shall we mention here?
    <br>It is all around us.
    <br>Very shocking, very unfortunate what is happening around the world today,
    <br>that led to many failures.
    <br>Like we have read in the Book of Proverbs 13:20 -
    <br>it ought to motivate us.
    <br>It ought to motivate us to seek out worthy examples.
    <br>All this is not meant to fall us over,
    <br>but it ought to motivate us to seek out worthy examples.
    <br>That is, people who lived years ago
    <br>or people alive now who can serve as examples of what we want to become.
    <br>This is what the Book of Proverbs is talking about here.
    <br>Read about them.
    <br>Like I've said, not all of us have had a father, friend, mentor or coach in our lives
    <br>that we want to follow.
    <br>That doesn't mean you don't have a father but a father that you need to follow.
    <br>That does not meant you don't have mentor but a mentor you need to follow.
    <br>You cannot do it alone.
    <br>You need good people to assist you as a coach in your desire to grow.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I need good people to assist me in my desire to grow."
    <br>You cannot do it alone.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I cannot do it alone".
    <br>I need a coach.
    <br>I need a mentor to assist me in my desire to grow.
    <br>You need a mentor.
    <br>You cannot do it alone.
    <br>Without a mentor, you cannot achieve extraordinary things.
    <br>There are teachers, but how many teachers are with difference?
    <br>There are pastors; how many pastors are with difference?
    <br>There are engineers, how many engineers are with difference?
    <br>There are presidents all over the world, how many presidents are with difference?
    <br>There are senators, lawmakers; how many of them are with difference?
    <br>This is extraordinarity we are talking about.
    <br>We have many wealthy, rich people; how many of them are with difference?
    <br>But we can still learn how to be a growing leader.
    <br>If I tell you you don't have a mentor, you can still learn how to be a growing leader
    <br>by learning from other great leaders.
    <br>How?
    <br>Read about them.
    <br>Take your time watching them, their tough time, their hard time,
    <br>seemingly impossible situations; how they handled them.
    <br>When I look at powerful people or people in positions,
    <br>I do not forget the many insults, attacks, oppositions, embarrassments
    <br>they endured in order to attain their position, their powerful status.
    <br>You need a mentor.
    <br>Many of us grow beyond
    <br>the level of knowledge we gathered from our parents.
    <br>Whatever you have received from your parents - many of us have grown beyond it.
    <br>You need a person or persons of vast experience or unique talent
    <br>to improve your career.
    <br>This is your mentor.
    <br>The twelve disciples that became apostles in the New Testament had Jesus.
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>Young Timothy had Paul as a mentor that taught him to be brave,
    <br>believe God and do the right things.
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>Joshua led a tremendous nation and won the battle after battle
    <br>but he had Moses to show him how to lead in battle.
    <br>You talk of Elisha?
    <br>Elisha performed more miracles than his coach, boss, mentor.
    <br>However, Elijah was his example of keeping focused, being brave,
    <br>believing God and doing the right thing.
    <br>I have had people watched from a distance.
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>It guided me,
    <br>watching them - how they handled their tough time, seemingly impossible situations,
    <br>has taught me valuable lesson.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Who are you watching?"
    <br>Who is your coach?
    <br>Who is your mentor?
    <br>Who is your mentor to assist you in your desire to grow?
    <br>Who are you watching?
    <br>Who is in your life as a coach to assist you in your desire to grow?
    <br>Ask your neighbour once again, "Who are you watching?"
    <br>Who is in your life?
    <br>Who is in your life as a mentor to assist you in your desire to grow?
    <br>You cannot do it alone.
    <br>When I look at powerful people or people in positions,
    <br>I do not forget the many insults, attacks and oppositions they endured
    <br>in order to achieve their powerful status.
    <br>This means difficulties, challenges and seemingly impossible situations
    <br>can be our greatest friends
    <br>because they make us to reflect about whom we were, whom we are and whom we shall be.
    <br>Positive examples are tremendous motivators for success.
    <br>Negative examples are tremendous motivators for failure.
    <br>Raise up for prayer.
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>Ask your neighbour once again, "Who is in your life?"
    <br>Who are you watching?
    <br>Who is in your life as a coach,
    <br>as a mentor to assist you in your desire to grow?
    <br>Right now, you open your lips, ask God to influence us in all our decisions.
    <br>Ask God to influence you.
    <br>Say, "Influence me in all my decisions".
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The reason why you need God to influence you:
    <br>You reject people, friends,
    <br>father, just name them
    <br>because of their weaknesses today,
    <br>without knowing they will be of use to you tomorrow.
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>When God influences you in all your decisions,
    <br>you will think as if Jesus is the one thinking.
    <br>Open your lips, ask Jesus to influence you.
    <br>See what is happening in your marriage, business, financial life,
    <br>in every area of your life because you are not influenced by God.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Look at what happened to Peter at the beginning.
    <br>If the name of Peter is not written, the Bible is not complete today.
    <br>You reject people because of their weaknesses today
    <br>without knowing that they will be of help to you tomorrow.
    <br>Ask God - influence me in all my decisions.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>When the Lord begins to influence you,
    <br>you begin to reason as if He is the one reasoning.
    <br>This puts a great honour upon you as a practical Christian.
    <br>That is the imitation of God.
    <br>Open your lips; ask God, "Influence me in all my decisions, in relating to people,
    <br>relationships, my business."
    <br>Ask Him to influence you.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Those that would be good must keep good company.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Those that would be good must keep good company.]
    <br>Those that would be good must keep good company
    <br>because men's character is known by the company they choose.
    <br>We must be holy as our Lord is holy,
    <br>perfect as He is perfect
    <br>and merciful as He is merciful.
    <br>No attribute of God is as recommended as His goodness.
    <br>Resemble Him in every grace
    <br>and especially in His love and in His pardoning goodness.
    <br>God is love.
    <br>Those that dwell in love, dwell in God.
    <br>Godlike grace.
    <br>This godlike grace should conduct and influence our whole conversation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This godlike grace should conduct and influence our whole conversation."
    <br>It should be the principle from which we act.
    <br>That is, godlike grace should be the principle from which we act,
    <br>should direct the end at which we aim.
    <br>Gods-likeness should conduct and influence the whole conversation, character, behavior.
    <br>When you think, read you examine it in the light of God's Word.
    <br>When you look, examine it in the light of the God's Word.
    <br>When somebody tells you something, "Hey, this is what happened" -
    <br>examine it because everyone is exposed to things that are not consistent.
    <br>We are in a generation without hope and without faith.
    <br>Whom can we believe?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "We are in a generation without hope, without faith. Whom can we believe?"
    <br>God.
    <br>So, you must examine everything.
    <br>If somebody is telling you that this is what he read,
    <br>he or she is confessing their weakness because they shouldn't quote what they read.
    <br>They should quote God.
    <br>When you read something, examine whatever you read in the light of God's Word;
    <br>now you can can quote God.
    <br>When somebody says, "This is what I heard",
    <br>he is confessing his weakness.
    <br>What is the weakness?
    <br>That he is not connected with God,
    <br>he cannot act with God.
    <br>When you cannot act with God, you read whatever your read -
    <br>it will give you information.
    <br>What you see will give you information.
    <br>What people say - you live on it.
    <br>What your circumstance looks like is what you depend on.
    <br>TB Joshua Speaks On MENTORSHIP...
    <br>When we cannot act with God, you go by what you read, what you see, what you hear,
    <br>what the situation looks like
    <br>because you cannot act with God.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
