    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for those afflicted with various sicknesses
    <br>and diseases in the Peru crusade, the chains of bondage in their lives are broken
    <br>as the power of Jesus Christ is clearly present on the scene.
    <br>I have pain in my coccyx.
    <br>Man of God, I want to be healed!
    <br>Knee trauma has left this lady confined to a wheelchair.
    <br>But with just a simple touch from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ, she begins to walk to the glory of God.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>The Peru Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>CRUSADE IN PERU
    <br>WITH T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Ysela Juarez Carranza
    <br>Lima, Peru
    <br>I am 41 years old.
    <br>As a result of an accident, I developed a knee problem and was unable to walk.
    <br>The prognosis from the doctor said that the problem was congenital.
    <br>I was unable to walk and I also had a problem with my coccyx.
    <br>Testimony From The Peru Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>For how long have you been having this problem?
    <br>Four years.
    <br>I went to four hospitals, two clinics and ultimately, they did not know the exact problem I had.
    <br>The last doctor I went to said that because I was born with the knee condition,
    <br>I needed an operation but there was no guarantee it would fix the problem I had.
    <br>Testimony From The Peru Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>It was very difficult.
    <br>My knees would swell up and I felt a lot of pain in my coccyx.
    <br>I couldn't walk; I needed other people to assist me.
    <br>Testimony From The Peru Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>What happened at the crusade when Prophet T.B. Joshua put his hand on you?
    <br>The prophet put his hand on my head, on my knees which were very swollen
    <br>and on my back and told me to walk.
    <br>How did you feel right after the crusade?
    <br>I feel really good.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>Are you still using the wheelchair?
    <br>I am not using it.
    <br>I walk normally; I could not run or climb stairs in a normal way.
    <br>Can you please show us what you can do right now?
    <br>Testimony From The Peru Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Yes and I can run too!
    <br>Mrs Ysela runs to the glory of God
    <br>because she no longer has the knee trauma that she once had before.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
