    <br>My name is Corporal Desmond Abane from Ghana.
    <br>I have a fracture in my right bone.
    <br>It's been one year now since I have had the fracture. Please, Man of God, deliver me!
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Corporal Desmond Abane in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Instantly, the power of Jesus, our Healer, comes on the scene
    <br>and begins to work in the broken body of the military officer.
    <br>He falls to the ground under the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua again taps the man's leg under the instruction of the Holy Ghost
    <br>as the healing takes place in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The man of God is being used as a channel of faith through which the healing anointing flows.
    <br>The power of God starts to raise Corporal Desmond's leg off the floor and stretch it out.
    <br>The military man grimaces as the spiritual restoration aligns and heals every part of his damaged body.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>It's me oh Lord
    <br>Standing in the need of prayer
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>With one last word from the Prophet,
    <br>Corporal Desmond is commanded to rise up and walk, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free; I can walk now!
    <br>The transformation is clear and the glory is for the Lord.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>People of God - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Desmond Abane from Ghana.
    <br>Last year on the 28th May, 2016, I had a car accident.
    <br>For the past one year now, I had not been able to walk
    <br>due to a fracture of the femur of my right leg.
    <br>I was facing a lot of problems and without crutches, I couldn't walk.
    <br>I fell down at least two times because of the problem.
    <br>I am a soldier by profession.
    <br>Due to my condition, I couldn't do many things, including my duties as a soldier.
    <br>I couldn't do a lot of other things which I was supposed to do due to the problem.
    <br>And where are the places you went to in search of solution to this problem?
    <br>I've been to the hospital and my doctor told me, it would take two years before I can walk again.
    <br>I've also been to herbal doctors trying to get to walk again but still, I couldn't walk.
    <br>But we saw you at The SCOAN today and the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua came and prayed for you.
    <br>Can you share with us your experience when Prophet T.B. Joshua stretched his hand towards your leg
    <br>and was praying for you in the name of Jesus?
    <br>When the man of God came towards me, my leg became stiff.
    <br>When he touched me, I immediately felt a serious shock. Then my leg started moving.
    <br>As he said, he came here with that terrible problem of inability to walk and his leg was stiff.
    <br>But as the man of God touched him and prayed for him, he felt he could raise his leg up,
    <br>which was something he could not do before.
    <br>We can see the man of God at a distance; he stretches his hand towards the man 
    <br>and you can see the man's leg moving and that is the power of God.
    <br>Only Jesus could have justly done this.
    <br>So after that prayer, tell us what you can do now.
    <br>After the man of God prayed for me, I can walk; I can even raise my leg
    <br>and do exercises which I couldn't do previously.
    <br>Halleluyah! Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Healed Of Fracture Of The Femur
    <br>No Longer Using A Crutch
    <br>So can you just demonstrate to us the things you can do right now that God Almighty has set you free.
    <br>Now, I can raise my leg which I couldn't raise to this level before.
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>You can see now!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>So can you walk to the glory of God?
    <br>That is the brother walking - walking to the glory of God.
    <br>This is what he could not do for a very long time. This is a soldier by profession.
    <br>That is the exercises he had to preform as a soldier but he could not do this for a very long time
    <br>because of that problem of fracture of the femur.
    <br>But today, God has healed him and he can do all those things that he could not do for a long time.
    <br>Shall we put our hands once again beautifully for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>Yes, we give glory to God Almighty; we have seen enough proof of what Jesus can do,
    <br>going by the many testimonies you have been listening to, including your own testimony.
    <br>So what simple advice do you have for millions and millions of people that are listening to you right now?
    <br>My advice is that they should trust in God; there is no problem God cannot solve.
    <br>They should put their faith in God.
    <br>Yes, the brother has adviced all to put their trust in God Almighty and to have faith in God,
    <br>because with faith in God Almighty, everything is possible.
    <br>You have dropped your crutches, meaning that you don't need it again?
    <br>I don't need it anymore!
    <br>Halleluyah! We give glory to God. Halleluyah!
    <br>So we want to advice you, God Almighty has healed you completely for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Make sure you continue to follow Him along the way, making His Word the standard for your life
    <br>and we know that the blessing, the healing you have received today,
    <br>more and more are still coming your way as you continue to head to God's Word, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Healed Of Fracture Of The Femur
    <br>No Longer Using A Crutch
    <br>Corporal Desmond returned home that day, healed in Jesus' name.
    <br>Overwhelmed by the radical transformation in his life,
    <br>he wasted no time in returning to The SCOAN,
    <br>to testify to the miraculous healing bestowed upon him by God Almighty.
    <br>Let us listen to him.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Let us put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>It's a wonderful, wonderful and wonder-kind of miracle
    <br>that God did in the life of this man,
    <br>and now he can walk by himself without the aid of a crutch that he came with to The SCOAN then.
    <br>People of God - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Corporal Abane Desmond from Ghana.
    <br>I am here to thank God for my life.
    <br>In 2016 on the 28th of May, I had a terrible accident.
    <br>My mate beside me died instantly through the accident.
    <br>I was suffering a lot and I had been to many places without a solution.
    <br>I had been going through a lot of pain and I was suffering.
    <br>I had a lot of pain in my body and I could not walk.
    <br>I was using crutches and I still fell down many times.
    <br>I was in a lot of pain as I was moving.
    <br>Even my leg could not move - it was stiff
    <br>I had been to physiotherapy but there was no solution.
    <br>Before I came here, exactly one year before I came here, I had a dream.
    <br>I encountered the man of God: He came into my dream and prayed for me in the dream.
    <br>Exactly the way he prayed for me in the church was how he prayed for me in the dream.
    <br>Ok, before you share with us your experience when you came to The SCOAN
    <br>we want you to tell us, what are the things you could not do then because of that problem?
    <br>As a military personnel, I could not do my duties.
    <br>I could not do my normal activities like bathing and a lot of other things.
    <br>Even to walk - I could not walk; I could not stand as I am standing here today.
    <br>There were a lot of things I could not do.
    <br>But I thank God that today, I am standing, I can walk and do my normal activities now.
    <br>And everyone would like to know, what happened before you had this ability
    <br>to do all these things you could not do then.
    <br>So share with us - what was your experience when you came to The SCOAN?
    <br>When I came, the man of God touched me.
    <br>When he touched me, I felt an electric shock in my bone.
    <br>My backbone was weak; I could feel my backbone pull together and join.
    <br>Then, I could hear the bones making noise
    <br>and my leg that was stiff was able to move and straighten out.
    <br>When the man of God was praying for me, I could see that the leg was able to raise up.
    <br>All along, I had been unable to raise it up.
    <br>I had been to physiotherapy and many places trying to get my leg to raise
    <br>but when the man of God touched me, the pain just vanished.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>You said immediately the man of God touched you, you experienced something on that particular leg.
    <br>Can you share with us again, what exactly you experienced.
    <br>I felt an electric shock in my leg.
    <br>Then, I felt my bones were shaking and moving.
    <br>Then, my bones were making noise and then they joined together.
    <br>I felt the bone at the back pull and join together.
    <br>Then, I heard a noise, a sharp noise in my bone.
    <br>When the man of God told me to stand up, that I was healed,
    <br>I woke up and walked without pain; the pain had just vanished instantly.
    <br>Corporal Abane Desmond
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Wonderful, so tell us, ever since then, what has been your condition?
    <br>Ever since then, I have no more pain.
    <br>I can now do my normal work as a soldier.
    <br>So now you can walk. Can you just exercise yourself
    <br>and let us see those things you could not do before now that you can do now.
    <br>Now I can march.
    <br>Wow, shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>That is what he said he could not do before now because of that problem in his leg.
    <br>He said his leg was  stiff and he could not even walk, he could not do anything.
    <br>So you could not do all this before now?
    <br>I could not walk, I could not even raise my leg; this is the leg that I'm raising.
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Corporal Abane Desmond
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>I can raise the leg now.
    <br>Oh, glory be to God in the highest.
    <br>So with this wonderful healing that God has done in your life,
    <br>what word of advice do you have for people listening to you?
    <br>I have a lot to tell the whole word.
    <br>What I want them to believe is to believe in God.
    <br>They should have faith in God; with God, all things are possible.
    <br>When I was going through pain, it was not easy but with God, it is easy.
    <br>The same God who healed me will also deliver them.
    <br>So, we should believe in God and leave worldly things - they will not help us.
    <br>When we come to God, that is the only way that will lead us to the salvation of our soul.
    <br>So you are advising all and sundry to trust in God?
    <br>Once you trust in God, you will never be confounded in time or eternity.
    <br>We thank God for this healing.
    <br>We can see some pictures besides you - what do you have to say about them?
    <br>Corporal Abane Desmond
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>The picture here is of the car on the very day I had the accident.
    <br>The wreckage?
    <br>Yes, that is the vehicle.
    <br>That was the first day, when they took me to the hospital in Ghana.
    <br>You can even see what was happening then.
    <br>My leg was hung on this; I could not move my leg.
    <br>That is what I was going through that year.
    <br>Those are the things I could not do.
    <br>So this picture details the very condition you were in before you came to The SCOAN
    <br>and the man of God prayed for you in the name of Jesus Christ, in the power of the Holy Ghost
    <br>and now you are free.
    <br>Oh, glory be to God in the highest!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>Corporal Abane Desmond
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>We thank God for this wonderful healing that God has done in your life and we want to encourage you
    <br>that now the Lord has healed you for the salvation of your soul,
    <br>you should make His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>you should meditate on it and see to it that you do what the Word says
    <br>and we pray that God will grant you the inner grace to do so, in Jesus' name.
