    <br>Your husband is an innocent person.

    <br>Dangerous Affair With Landlord EXPOSED!!!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Gbemisola Oni.
    <br>The man standing next to me is Mr Gbenga Oni, my lovely husband.
    <br>Dangerous Affair With Landlord EXPOSED!!!
    <br>Last week, during the course of the service,
    <br>the man of God prophesied that there is a woman here,
    <br>that the landlord is fighting the husband because of the woman, which is me;
    <br>that we are going too far,
    <br>that I can't help myself, and I should come out.
    <br>I should not let them kill my husband.
    <br>I bless the name of the Lord for this prophecy, because I was so happy that Sunday.
    <br>I knew this prophecy was for me.
    <br>I came out last week Sunday to confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>This happened two years ago when we were looking for accommodation.
    <br>My husband was a very busy person, so he handed everything over to me to look for accommodation.
    <br>When I was looking for accommodation, I met a man.
    <br>The man asked me where my husband was.
    <br>I said that my husband was fine and that we had two children together, and that he had gone to work.
    <br>He said, "Ok".
    <br>The man gave us the accommodation and we paid him.
    <br>After two months of living in the house
    <br>the man started calling me on the phone and said, "Hello. I love you".
    <br>I said, "What? I don't think you know what you are saying".
    <br>He said that from the very first day that he met me, he loved me.
    <br>He said that he was upstairs and was looking at me as I was walking into the compound.
    <br>He even described the clothes that I wore that same day.
    <br>He said that I wore a yellow top. I said, "No, I disagree. I can't".
    <br>He kept on calling me, but I disagreed.
    <br>As time went on, I just felt weak and I did not understand myself; I couldn't disagree anymore.
    <br>One day he called me to his apartment.  That is how it started.
    <br>After having an affair with him, I started hating myself.
    <br>"What have I done to myself?". I was not happy after the relationship.
    <br>He started calling me again and said that I should come and see him.
    <br>I said, "For what?" and I embarrassed him on the phone.
    <br>At a stage I blocked him on my phone so he couldn't call me or reach me.
    <br>He then came to my apartment a second time and knocked on my door.
    <br>He said, "You are for me". I said, "For who? I am not for you".  He said, "You are for me".
    <br>He said that he really enjoyed me and he really loved me.  I said, "No, you shamed me".
    <br>I looked into his eyes and embarrassed him, "You shamed me".
    <br>That same day he had sex with me.
    <br>Since then I was having bad dreams and my husband's work was not like before.
    <br>He was sacked at work and everything just went down for him.
    <br>The family was not happy and I saw splatters of blood in the compound.
    <br>That was when I noticed that this man was not doing this ordinarily.
    <br>I called my husband and I explained everything to him.
    <br>What were the things you started observing about the man and your husband?
    <br>My husband was a very gentle man, a very calm man and minded his own business.
    <br>I now noticed that this man would call my husband and insult him.
    <br>At times, if there was any small issue,
    <br>he would disconnect the electricity in the house for three months and he disconnected the water.
    <br>My husband had to fetch water in a street nearby, and we were the only tenants in the compound.
    <br>So the water was there, but he was behaving wickedly.
    <br>My husband said, "What is all this?". He did not understand.
    <br>He was sacked from work; everything was down for him. I felt sorry for him, wondering what was going on.
    <br>That was when I told my husband, "Just be calm", because at times he would cry.
    <br>And I asked myself, "What is all this?".
    <br>I called my husband and confessed to him that this is what was going on between the landlord and I;
    <br>that is why the landlord was causing trouble for us in the house.
    <br>Through that prophecy, what do you think would have happened to your husband because of you?
    <br>He wanted to kill my husband.
    <br>My husband felt frustrated.
    <br>At times when my husband spoke to me, I would get angry and shout at him.
    <br>And at times he would sit down and cry, "Why is this lady doing this to me?".
    <br>I would go back to him and say, "It is ok. What happened?".
    <br>He said, "Why are you getting angry all the time for any little thing?".
    <br>"Just pick this up. Do this" and I would get angry.
    <br>At times he would call me and I would not answer his call.
    <br>He said that he would leave our marriage and I would not see him again.
    <br>Do you mean that your husband was ready to end the marriage?
    <br>Yes, he said I would just come back from my shop one day and I would not see any of his things; he would leave me.
    <br>After confessing to my husband, we decided to come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>to hear the mind of God whether to continue the marriage or end it,
    <br>because the marriage was getting worse every day.
    <br>When I confessed to my husband, I told him not to tell anybody about the issue
    <br>and he promised me saying that no one would hear these things from his mouth.
    <br>When we came to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations last week Sunday, the man of God prophesied.
    <br>I was so weak, but I thank God that He located me. I was so happy.
    <br>And later my husband was outside calling me, "Let's go home". I said, "I am not going home".
    <br>"Are you not in the church? I received a prophecy". The man of God said it, so he also heard it,
    <br>but since he had promised me not tell anybody, that is why he became quiet.
    <br>He said, "I've already come out; I am out already".
    <br>That is how the man of God ...
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Dangerous Affair With Landlord EXPOSED!!!
    <br>Tell us, after you came out for the prophecy, what happened and how are you now?
    <br>I am fine and my family are happy. We are doing things together.
    <br>There is peace of mind. There is love.
    <br>We moved out of the house after the prophecy.
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Dangerous Affair With Landlord EXPOSED!!!
    <br>My name is Oni Paul Gbenga and the lady beside me is my beautiful wife, Gbemisola Oni.
    <br>Dangerous Affair With Landlord EXPOSED!!!
    <br>We want to bless the name of the Lord
    <br>for the wonderful prophecy by the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>Because last week Sunday the prophecy came out that there is a woman in this church
    <br>and she is having a relationship with the landlord.
    <br>And because of this, the landlord has threatened the husband and he wants to kill the husband.
    <br>I want to confirm this prophecy to be 100% true,
    <br>because this whole thing started when we moved into the apartment.
    <br>Like my wife said, I was the one who gave her money; I was a very busy man then.
    <br>I gave her money to look for this apartment for us.
    <br>Afterwards she called me and said that she had found one.
    <br>I gave her money and we moved into the apartment.
    <br>Two months after we moved in, I discovered that things were not fine in the home.
    <br>I used to love my wife - she is a lovely wife - and we really loved each other very much,
    <br>but I discovered that after we moved into that house there wasn't affection anymore in the relationship, in the family.
    <br>My wife would be moody.
    <br>When I spoke, she would flare up and get angry.
    <br>She would have a strange attitude, which was not there before we moved into the house.
    <br>Secondly, I discovered that things were not fine in the house, financially or with everything else.
    <br>My things, my car broke down and I spent a lot of money on the car. It didn't work.
    <br>My office, everything, financially broke down.
    <br>I'm the kind of person who doesn't talk and I am very close to God.
    <br>I now went to a mountain and I fasted for three days. I prayed to God and said, "God, what is happening?".
    <br>"Ever since we moved into this house, things have not been going smoothly the way things are supposed to be moving".
    <br>I prayed and I fasted for three days - white fasting, that when I wanted to break, I used coconut to break the fasting.
    <br>As I came back from the fasting, one day my wife called me and said that she had something to tell me.
    <br>I said, "What is that?".
    <br>She began to weep and cry and said that something happened that she has kept to herself for a long time.
    <br>She said that she and the landlord had sex.
    <br>I was surprised; I was shocked. I said, "What? How come it happened?".
    <br>She began to confess. I said, "God?".
    <br>People of God, immediately I noticed that that was the root cause of what had been happening in the house
    <br>because we used to love each other.
    <br>There was no affection; things were just going down.
    <br>I am the kind of person who is very close to God, right from my childhood.
    <br>Immediately when she mentioned that she had had sex with the landlord I was surprised,
    <br>because I used to watch Emmanuel TV and the man of God used to preach about forgiveness.
    <br>It came to my mind, "You have to forgive this woman".
    <br>Immediately in my heart I said, "Don't worry".
    <br>"Since you have opened up to me, the devil has been put to shame in our lives".
    <br>Dangerous Affair With Landlord EXPOSED!!!
    <br>In my heart I immediately found a place to forgive her, and I forgave her. I told her, "Don't worry."
    <br>She told me that this thing she wanted me to ... I said, "Don't worry. I will keep this thing".
    <br>People of God, before God and man, I kept this secret within me; I didn't share it with anybody.
    <br>Were you surprised when the prophetic message came out?
    <br>I was surprised. And this prophecy is 100% true because this is what brought us to The SCOAN.
    <br>In my mind, I did not share this with anybody - even my parents who are watching right now.
    <br>I have never shared this experience with anybody; I kept it to myself.
    <br>But last week Sunday, when the man of God mentioned it, I was shocked.
    <br>Just because she told me and confessed to me, and I have forgiven her in my heart,
    <br>I said, "Ok. Maybe the prophecy wasn't ...".
    <br>But she came out and told me that, "This prophecy is our prophecy",
    <br>because she knew that I was still keeping this thing in my heart.
    <br>Let us come and put the devil to shame. Let us say these things.
    <br>But it is a shameful thing that we don't need to say outside to people, for people to hear about it.
    <br>I am a shy person, so I kept it to myself.
    <br>But we came out last week Sunday and confirmed the prophecy.
    <br>I want to bless the name of the Lord because God has broken that yoke.
    <br>It is a wonder. It is a great yoke that God has broken in my family.
    <br>We are free. The Bible says, "If the Son sets you free, you are free indeed".
    <br>Myself, my wife, my family and my kids - we are free by this wonderful prophecy from Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Dangerous Affair With Landlord EXPOSED!!!
    <br>Since after that prayer and deliverance, how is your wife now?
    <br>I want to bless God. We are fine because I told her, "I have forgiven you".
    <br>But in her mind, maybe she thought I have not forgiven her.
    <br>Since last week Monday when the man of God touched me and my wife, I have peace in my mind.
    <br>She also confessed to me that she has peace in her mind.
    <br>I want to say this because the prophecy was for me.
    <br>My wife may not really understand because
    <br>the man of God said, "... for the land owner to kill your husband",  because I knew this man.
    <br>We've moved away from the house, but this man is still holding our property. Do you understand?
    <br>Definitely, my mind is still always with the property, with the man, with the landlord. Our property is still there.
    <br>He tried many things. After I discovered that he had sex with my wife, I kept it to myself.
    <br>He kept on threatening - the threats were so many.
    <br>He gave us the good news that we should move.
    <br>He disconnected only our electricity. We were just two in the compound. We were staying in a duplex.
    <br>He disconnected the electricity and the water, and the water would be rushing.  There were so many threats.
    <br>There was a time before I went to the mountain, I had a dream.
    <br>I saw myself in a coffin in the dream.
    <br>So, my wife did not really understand the prophecy, because I believe the prophecy was for me,
    <br>because this man wanted to kill me. Seriously.
    <br>Spiritually, he wanted to kill me.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Dangerous Affair With Landlord EXPOSED!!!
    <br>People of God, my advice is: In whatever situation you are in, be closer to God.
    <br>The Bible says that if God is with you no one - no man - can stand against you.
    <br>God was with us and God is still with us. I bless the name of the Lord.
    <br>And I bless the name of God for using Prophet TB Joshua to bless the lives of so many souls.
    <br>I bless the name of the Lord.
    <br>Thank you very much. Put your hands together.
    <br>I want to use this medium to beg my husband to please forgive me.
    <br>Dangerous Affair With Landlord EXPOSED!!!
    <br>It is ok. I have forgiven you, as God has forgiven us our sins.
    <br>- Praise the Lord.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>My advice for everyone here:
    <br>Any time you are facing difficulties or you notice something strange, run to God and be prayerful.
    <br>If I were prayerful, I don't think this would have happened to me.
    <br>But because I was slack, that is why this happened.
