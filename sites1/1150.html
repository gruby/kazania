    <br>Led by the omniscient Spirit of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua moves around the congregation,
    <br>revealing prophetic insight into people's lives that exposes the root of their problems,
    <br>releasing them for their deliverance.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on.
    <br>You are using one honey.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You know honey? Honey that they lick.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>As I touched you, I felt there was honey given to you by a spiritualist.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>For what?
    <br>Fruit of the womb; they said I should be taking it.
    <br>But the way you are taking it is not normal because you are now using it to rub your private part.
    <br>Exactly, sir.
    <br>How can you use honey to rub your private part?
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>After the prophecy, Mrs  Joy Nkeke rushes to the toilet to check herself
    <br>and discovers that truly, a spiritual operation has taken place
    <br>and her menstruation that had seized for many years has returned.
    <br>A few minutes after her deliverance, Mrs Joy Nkeke came forward to share her instant testimony.
    <br>Let's listen to her.
    <br>Man of God, after you prayed for me,
    <br>the menstruation I had not seen for four years, I have started seeing it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>For four years, you had not been seeing your menstruation?
    <br>Yes. After taking that honey, for four years, it ceased.
    <br>After taking that honey, the menstruation ceased?
    <br>Yes. I have started seeing it now.
    <br>After the prayer?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Joy Nkeke, I am a Nigerian. I came from Denmark.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was ceased menstruation for four years.
    <br>Last week Sunday, the man of God prophesied to me that
    <br>I was using honey given to me by a spiritualist.
    <br>I said, yes.
    <br>After the man of God laid hands on me, I started seeing my menstruation immediately.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mrs Joy Nkeke
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>You made it clear that the problem that brought you to The SCOAN last Sunday
    <br>was ceased menstruation for four years.
    <br>While you were in the midst of the people during the laying of hands
    <br>by the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua, he came exactly to where you were
    <br>and prophesied to you that you were given honey, which you confirmed to be true.
    <br>Instantly he laid hands on you, your menstruation that had been seized for four years started flowing.
    <br>Could you tell us how it all started?
    <br>It all started when I was looking for the fruit of the womb.
    <br>So, I went to a spiritualist who gave me some honey.
    <br>After taking the honey, I started eating in the dream;
    <br>masquerades were chasing me in the dream.
    <br>It looked as if my problem increased.
    <br>My menstruation ceased.
    <br>Last week Sunday when the man of God laid his hand on me and prophesied to me,
    <br>I started seeing my menstruation immediately.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mrs Joe Nkeke
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I want to say, "Thank You, Jesus". If you are looking for a solution, Jesus is the solution.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for all you have done in my life.
    <br>You heard it from her. With what the Lord has done in her life.
    <br>Her menstruation that had seized for four years started flowing instantly
    <br>the message of prophecy came forth and she received a touch from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>That was the end of the seized menstruation, to the glory of God.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
