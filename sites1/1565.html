  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>You mean you are fine?
    <br>How are you?
    <br>You are fine?
    <br>From your heart?
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus, for that."
    <br>Let someone say, "The joy of the Lord is my strength."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the joy of the Lord is my strength."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You may be seated in His presence.
    <br>The joy of the Lord is our strength.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Brethren, I believe I am talking to believers.
    <br>When you look through the highway of life,
    <br>when you look through your immediate surroundings, what you see is frightening.
    <br>You see satan busy using man's unrighteousness as an instrument for his purpose
    <br>to kill, to steal and to destroy:
    <br>economic oppression, poverty, setback,
    <br>physical oppression, sickness, disease, disabilities,
    <br>demonic oppression, occult practices and ritual murders,
    <br>religious oppression, intolerance, violence everywhere,
    <br>moral oppression, institutionalised corruption in high places.
    <br>So, through our daily challenges, as a true believer,
    <br>you must find enough calm to think properly, to think clearly and to react diligently.
    <br>But unfortunately, so many people today react intellectually, emotionally to their situations
    <br>and they are overwhelmed.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't lose control.
    <br>Neighbour,
    <br>no matter what comes, no matter what happens, don't lose control."
    <br>If you lose control, you lose all sense of reasoning.
    <br>And when you lose the sense of judgement, you fight the wrong battle;
    <br>you begin to see others as your enemies.
    <br>We are quick to misjudge, to blame others.
    <br>You begin to point fingers at others as being the cause of your problem.
    <br>When one is overcome by poverty, when he sees someone more well off than him,
    <br>he sees him as an enemy.
    <br>When one is overcome by depression, when he sees others happy, it irritates him.
    <br>When one is overcome even by sickness, those who are not sick,
    <br>he sees them as enemies, as insensitive to his plight.
    <br>He begins to blame others, "The sickness that I have, my mother has it. That person has it."
    <br>You begin to chase shadows.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>we are not fighting flesh and blood; we are fighting evil spirits."
    <br>Many relationships, business relationships, many marriages, many political relationships as well
    <br>hit the rock of trials and temptations every day.
    <br>Some even have abandoned their faith and turned to alternatives rather than God.
    <br>If you don't know the purpose of life,
    <br>you are likely to be overwhelmed by the happenings around you
    <br>and begin to take actions that can destroy relationships beyond repair.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>don't be controlled by your situation."
    <br>As true believers we must learn to see the value in our trials, in the challenges that come our way.
    <br>As a Christian, as a man of faith, as a woman of faith, the Scripture says,
    <br>when the eyes of our faith are opened to reality, we begin to see the value of our trial.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>when the eyes of your faith are opened, you begin to see the value of your trials.
    <br>This leads us to our message this morning:
    <br>OVERCOME YOUR SITUATION
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, overcome your situation."
    <br>Tell your neighbour again, "Overcome your situation."
    <br>Tell the viewers watching you, "Overcome your situation."
    <br>Let me take you to our proof text - the Book of Romans 8.
    <br>I will start my reading from verse 35; it reads:
    <br>"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
    <br>Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine,
    <br>or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
    <br>As it is written:
    <br>'For Your sake we are killed all day long;
    <br>We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.'
    <br>Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.
    <br>For I am persuaded that neither death nor life,
    <br>nor angels nor principalities nor powers,
    <br>nor things present nor things to come,
    <br>nor height nor depth nor any other created thing,
    <br>shall be able to separate us from the love of God
    <br>which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
    <br>Let someone say, "Hallelujah!"
    <br>When you consider what happened to Paul in the Book of 2 Corinthians 12:7
    <br>when he prayed for the thorn to be removed,
    <br>you will realise that there are some situations in our lives
    <br>that no amount of prayer and fasting can remove.
    <br>The Bible refers to those situations as unchangeable events.
    <br>Unchangeable events can be in the form of sickness, hardship, failure, imprisonment -
    <br>just name it.
    <br>Job's affliction was an unchangeable event; he endured it for the glory of God.
    <br>Daniel, despite his prayers, found himself in the lion's den;
    <br>it was an unchangeable event but he saw it as an opportunity to honour God in his trials.
    <br>Joseph's being sold as a slave to a foreign land was an unchangeable event
    <br>that was a bridge to greater heights.
    <br>Joseph never took revenge against his brothers
    <br>because he saw the value of his trials, the purpose of his trials.
    <br>Are you talking about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in the Book of Mark 14 from verse 36?
    <br>At Gethsemane, Jesus prayed to the Father that the cup of His suffering may pass Him by.
    <br>In Luke 22, the Bible says an angel came to strengthen Him -
    <br>that this was an unchangeable event.
    <br>Jesus Christ submitted to the revealing Word of God
    <br>and took a heart decision to go through the Cross
    <br>in order to bring an eternity of gain for you and me.
    <br>There are two things we should not confuse: There are situations and there is a situation.
    <br>Satan comes to kill, to steal and to destroy but Jesus comes to give you life, to give me life -
    <br>abundant life - in every aspect of your life.
    <br>Therefore, as a Christian, as a believer, whatever situation you are in,
    <br>there is no real evil in it because God is aware.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>whatever situation you may be in, there is no real evil because God is aware.
    <br>When God Almighty is executing His plan in our lives, He allows events
    <br>which continue to unfold until His purpose in our lives is fulfilled.
    <br>Let someone say, "Events which seem ordinary may have extraordinary effects in the Spirit,
    <br>much of which is hidden to the ordinary eye.
    <br>Events which seem ordinary may have extraordinary effects in the Spirit,
    <br>much of which is hidden to the ordinary eye.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>'Extraordinary effects' means an extraordinary situation.
    <br>Say, "My situation is not like others."
    <br>Believers may encounter challenges but their situations are not like others.
    <br>Others, their situation is to impair them, to destroy but yours is to improve you,
    <br>to draw you closer to God.
    <br>The more sensibly we feel the pain, the persecution,
    <br>the better improved we are in our prayers and relationship with God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>the more sensibly we feel the pain, the better improved we are in our prayers and relationship with God."
    <br>Whatever happens, whatever comes, it is too early to judge;
    <br>it is too early to be overwhelmed.
    <br>Sit back in silence and see what God is about to do.
    <br>Brethren,
    <br>God's command to Abraham was a test of faith.
    <br>Others submit and yield to the pressure and tension of their situations
    <br>and take wrong decisions.
    <br>But a believer is conscious of his faith; that is why he takes rightful decisions.
    <br>God's command to ask Abraham to sacrifice his son was a test.
    <br>Abraham could have abandoned his faith but he didn't.
    <br>Joseph, being sold as a slave, had every reason to give up but he didn't.
    <br>Job had every reason on the outside to yield to the advice of his wife to deny God
    <br>but he didn't.
    <br>Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego - the only alternative they had to save their lives
    <br>was to deny their God but they did not.
    <br>They were conscious of their faith in the midst of pressure and tension.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>it takes a reflective mind to discover that beyond that situation lies God's purpose."
    <br>God's command for Abraham to sacrifice his son was for a purpose.
    <br>The Book of Galatians 3:8 says that God foresaw that the Gentiles would be justified by faith,
    <br>preached the Gospel beforehand to him, saying, "In you, all nations shall be blessed."
    <br>Let someone say, "God has a Son, Jesus Christ."
    <br>He planted Him in the earth, on the Cross to produce a family.
    <br>Today, millions are born again through His seed, Jesus Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All these heroes of faith had something in common:
    <br>They fought the same battle camouflaged differently - different situations
    <br>but they overcame their situation
    <br>and they came out of it better than when they went into it.
    <br>God Almighty prepared them for victory before He threw them into the fire of life.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>God has prepared you, before He threw you into the fire of life."
    <br>Then they were able to defeat the purpose of satan
    <br>by remaining faithful to God to the very end.
    <br>What lesson can we learn from them?
    <br>Those who have a clear purpose of life,
    <br>no matter what comes, no matter what happens,
    <br>they always find room in their heart to bless the name of the Lord,
    <br>even when He takes away.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>those who have a clear purpose of life,
    <br>no matter what comes, no matter what happens,
    <br>they always have room in their hearts to praise the name of the Lord,
    <br>even when He takes away."
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attacks.
    <br>Being faithful to God does not eliminate adversities.
    <br>The level at which satan attacks us today
    <br>seems to be equal to the level of our commitment to God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>the level at which satan attacks us today
    <br>seems to be equal to the level of our commitment to God."
    <br>If you are truly committed to God, God will take up all of satan's challenges against you.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>be faithful. God is faithful to those who are faithful to Him."
    <br>If you are truly committed to God, God will take up all of satan's challenges against you.
    <br>I want to ask you a question.
    <br>What is the secret of their victory?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>what is the secret of their victory?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>Ask me.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The secret of their victory:
    <br>Their faith was not based on the things God created but on God, the Creator.
    <br>The object of their faith was God Almighty - not the blessings, not the breakthrough.
    <br>That is why their faith said, as Job, "Whether I am healed or not, God is my Healer."
    <br>Abraham said, "Whether I am blessed or not, God is my Provider."
    <br>Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego said,
    <br>"Whether I am delivered or not, God is my Deliverer."
    <br>If our faith is based on the blessing, on the healing, on the breakthrough,
    <br>that faith will have nothing to rest on when those things seem to delay in coming
    <br>or when they are taken away from you.
    <br>That is why Jesus Christ emphasised in the Book of Mark 11:22, "Have faith in God."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, have faith in God."
    <br>Christ's standard of faith is God Almighty.
    <br>That is why Jesus said further in Matthew,
    <br>"Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness
    <br>and every other thing shall be given to you."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, no matter your situation today, look up to Jesus.
    <br>Look up to Him."
    <br>Healing, deliverance is not a great deal for Jesus.
    <br>He has the solution.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Finally brethren,
    <br>no matter the situation that brought you here today,
    <br>no matter how difficult, how impossible it may seem to you today, we overcome by faith.
    <br>Our physical eyes can only see the present darkness, the present pain,
    <br>the present sickness, the present barrenness
    <br>but the eyes of faith can see the light.
    <br>A man or woman of faith, who lives by faith, walks by faith,
    <br>requires no evidence of the senses for rightful judgement.
    <br>His life is centred in Christ Jesus, not on how he is doing, how he is feeling or how he is treated.
    <br>Remember what Prophet T.B. Joshua says:
    <br>Life is all about challenges and how we respond to each situation.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>life is all about choices and how we respond to every situation."
    <br>How do you respond to your present situation?
    <br>Focusing on Christ Jesus in the midst of trial, poverty, setback, barrenness
    <br>puts everything else in its proper perspective.
    <br>Ask Job and he will tell you that, that sickness that seems incurable is not incurable at all
    <br>from eternity's perspective.
    <br>Ask Job, he will tell you that, that situation that looks like failure is not failure at all
    <br>from eternity's perspective.
    <br>Ask Hannah and she will tell you that that barrenness is not barrenness at all
    <br>from God's point of view.
    <br>Therefore, no matter what happens, no matter what comes,
    <br>if God allows it as a trial, as a test of faith, don't think it strange and doubt your God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>no matter what comes, no matter what happens,
    <br>if God allows it as a test, don't think it strange and doubt your God."
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>I say, rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The purpose of the devil is to shake our faith in the Word of God,
    <br>cause us to see God in a bad light and bring us to query the truth in the Word of God,
    <br>then to overthrow our position in Christ.
    <br>His purpose is to see you sad, to see you crying, shedding tears
    <br>but remember our conquering power - joy.
    <br>Let someone say, "The joy of the Lord is my strength."
    <br>Therefore, rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you mean you have joy?
    <br>From your heart?
    <br>Do you mean your enemy is defeated?
    <br>Do you mean you are victorious?
    <br>Victory is as sure as the rising of the sun for you.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
