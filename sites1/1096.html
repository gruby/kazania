    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good morning, Church!
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Good Morning!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Don’t forget – today is the last meeting before the birthday.
    <br>This is an opportunity to let you know whom you are celebrating.
    <br>How do we celebrate this kind of man?
    <br>You can see, he is not a superstar.
    <br>He is a man of people.
    <br>If he is a man of people, let us look for people who need what we have.
    <br>People who are in need – look for them; that is how to celebrate him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I must give that honour and respect for the little ones.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Today is the last Sunday before the celebration.
    <br>You know you were born on June 12th!
    <br>- Hallelujah.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>You have many things to watch in terms of videos and recordings
    <br>concerning the man you are seeing today, your little brother, T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Right from the beginning of the ministry at the time you got to know T.B. Joshua,
    <br>you will study that humility because I found myself in a simple and humble family background.
    <br>That is what is reflecting in me.
    <br>When I say humble, simple, I mean, lacking basic needs of life.
    <br>To lack the basic needs of life, you know what it means.
    <br>I am going to show you the humble home I came from.
    <br>We still preserve this home.
    <br>When you go to my village, you will find it just the same.
    <br>I said, "No. Don't touch it. Leave it."
    <br>Let us see the humble home.
    <br>THIS IS THE PICTURE OF OUR HUMBLE HOME
    <br>That is my humble home I came from.
    <br>It is still there; we preserved it.
    <br>I said, "No. Don't touch it."
    <br>There was a very strong force which God is behind -
    <br>kept telling me that what I was going through was a preparation for my future.
    <br>I mean, a strong force I could not resist.
    <br>As I am standing here, there is a force that is telling me
    <br>that what you are going through right now may not be found tomorrow.
    <br>In those early years of my life, I knew I would be blamed if I gave my attention
    <br>to what I was going through.
    <br>Consequently, I did not want my focus to be broken.
    <br>I chose to direct my focus on the right path, on what is right
    <br>because of the strong force that was directing me; I could not resist that force.
    <br>As I am standing now, there is a force I cannot resist which God is behind.
    <br>I cannot resist; it is telling me...
    <br>Each time I try to go wrong, it will say to me, "No. Go this way."
    <br>Anytime I felt I was missing my focus, it became a very strong motivation to pray
    <br>and be closer to God.
    <br>As a human being, there must be...
    <br>But anytime - it became a very strong motivation to pray to God, and to be closer to God.
    <br>It was still the same strong, mighty force that kept telling me,
    <br>“Concentrate on your future. Ignore the present.
    <br>Concentrate on your future; ignore what you are going through.
    <br>Concentrate on your future because what you are going through may not be found tomorrow”.
    <br>CONCENTRATE ON YOUR FUTURE
    <br>Concentrate on your future.
    <br>What you are going through is a preparation for your future, a bridge to your future.
    <br>The more I prayed, the less people would see me and the more isolated I became.
    <br>This affected all of my social life.
    <br>In those days, my colleagues and friends around complained
    <br>that I was not social and civilised enough like them.
    <br>That was their complain, "That guy - leave him. Let him go."
    <br>That kept me isolated.
    <br>They complained I was not social and civilised enough like them.
    <br>In this way, wrong, mistakes became an incentive that drew me closer to God
    <br>instead of otherwise.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “If you make a mistake, don’t run from God; run to Him”.
    <br>Wrong became an incentive that drew me closer to God.
    <br>Whatever you are going through now, listen to me.
    <br>Whatever your present challenge is now, whatever your tribulation or condition,
    <br>it’s merely a preparation for your future.
    <br>It may not be found tomorrow because it is a preparation for your future.
    <br>That is why it may not be found.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Whatever I am going through, whatever the challenge or difficulty,
    <br>it may not be found tomorrow because it is a preparation for the future."
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>You just need to know this.
    <br>Like I have told you, there was a force I could not resist.
    <br>I tried to resist, but each time the voice, "No. Do this."
    <br>I could not resist it.
    <br>The voice kept telling me, “Concentrate on your future
    <br>because the situation you are in now may not be found tomorrow”.
    <br>Once again, Happy Birthday in advance!
    <br>I was a baby before the death of my father.
    <br>You know little baby before the death of my father.
    <br>Consequently, I knew nothing about my late father
    <br>and the entire family burden rested squarely on my mother’s shoulder.
    <br>Let them show you the picture of my late father.
    <br>THIS IS THE PICTURE OF MY LATE FATHER, G.K. BALOGUN
    <br>THIS IS THE PICTURE OF MY LATE MOTHER, FOLARIN BALOGUN WHO GAVE ME HER LAST HUG
    <br>This is my mum; the last hug, "Bye bye", given to me.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I want to pay a special tribute to my late mother,
    <br>who always advised me to look into my love walk.
    <br>Failing to do so can shut down our relationship with God.
    <br>I salute her.
    <br>What a wonderful woman!
    <br>She never failed to call us for prayer before going to bed.
    <br>When I was baby...
    <br>It was a must, a duty; she called us for prayer before going to bed.
    <br>Don’t forget – prayer from the heart is Spirit prayer; it leads to dreams and revelations.
    <br>That really helped greatly; the impact was so great.
    <br>I often dreamt; I was always taught the Scriptures in the dream ‘til now.
    <br>That gave me an urge; over...
    <br>I was the smallest boy in my class but always led prayer.
    <br>When you look at the picture, you will see me very little among them, but I always led the prayer.
    <br>My teachers and colleagues always called me ‘small pastor’.
    <br>I think some of you might have watched the video in the past; they always called me 'small pastor'.
    <br>In human life, many things could cause one to stop between steps.
    <br>For example, my educational career suffered epileptic fits.
    <br>What I mean by 'epileptic fits'?
    <br>Today I am in school, the next day out.
    <br>I was very smart and brilliant but the reason was beyond me.
    <br>I attended six colleges in less than one year.
    <br>If I may begin with...
    <br>My first college was Ansar-Ud-Deen Grammar School, Ikare (AUD).
    <br>From there, I left the village back to Lagos in a mysterious way.
    <br>There are many records I am still keeping for 60, 70, 80, 90!
    <br>Because I know you keep asking yourself, “Why now is this man showing this record?”
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, I started at the age of 55; another record at 60; I keep so many.
    <br>I am going to show you just 10 percent of those records today.
    <br>I began my college at Ansar-Ud-Deen Grammar School in Ikare, called AUD, in a mysterious way.
    <br>I was one of the 'late candidates', 'late admission'.
    <br>I was in E class, classes were not supposed to extend to E, they stopped at D.
    <br>I spent nine months and left mysteriously back to Lagos.
    <br>When I came to Lagos, the first college I attended was Metropolitan College in Isolo.
    <br>I was there for three months.
    <br>I left to New State High School and spent one month there.
    <br>From New State High School, I went to Bishop Aggrey College where I spent three months.
    <br>From there to Ikotun, there is a college where we were the first students there; it was called Muslim College.
    <br>I spent three months also there.
    <br>All this happened in less than one year.
    <br>I was moving from...
    <br>The reason was beyond me, I will not be able to explain it.
    <br>The first college - I can only share this with you because of time.
    <br>At the first college AUD in Ikare, suddenly one night at 3am, I never knew what took me out.
    <br>I was on the street at 3am, just going on the street.
    <br>It was a watchman who saw me, rescued my life and placed me at his duty post until daybreak.
    <br>He later took me to the authorities in the school to explain.
    <br>Then, I was 'half-balanced'.
    <br>I could not continue my education; back to my mummy.
    <br>I spent another two years at home.
    <br>That is one; I will not be able to tell you about the others because of time; at 60 I will share with you.
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY T.B. JOSHUA AT 55!!!
    <br>I attended six colleges in less than one year.
    <br>I told you this; whatever you are going through now, whatever situation you are in
    <br>may not be found tomorrow because it is a preparation for your future.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever you are going through, whatever you are facing
    <br>may not be found tomorrow because it is a preparation for your future,
    <br>to link you to the future.
    <br>Now, I want to begin to show you some records. Let me start from my birth.
    <br>The record I am about to show you is not saying I have arrived
    <br>but to encourage the weak and those without fast legs or human help
    <br>that there is hope – Jesus is the hope.
    <br>I stayed in my mother’s womb for fifteen months.
    <br>At nine months, my mother was moving from one medical centre to another
    <br>because she was in labour.
    <br>From nine months, my mother began labour and she was moving from one medical centre
    <br>to another hospital until she was carried to a place called Egbe Medical Centre.
    <br>At that time, it seemed to be the best hospital in Nigeria, if not one of the best.
    <br>Go to the record.
    <br>So, let's see the picture of the hospital where my mummy finally delivered me.
    <br>THIS IS THE PICTURE OF EGBE HOSPITAL, WHERE I WAS BORN AT LAST
    <br>AFTER MY MOTHER VISITED MANY MEDICAL CENTRES
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I was delivered and about to be named on the seventh day in a naming ceremony,
    <br>arrangements were made and many guests turned up who wanted to see a child
    <br>who spent fifteen months in his mother’s womb.
    <br>You can imagine the number of people that were present.
    <br>In our village, there is so much rock that needs to be blasted before getting water.
    <br>It became a habit; everyday, they had to blast to get water from the ground.
    <br>Opposite the house where I was about to be named,
    <br>there was a company that was blasting rocks for water.
    <br>Suddenly, a very big stone...
    <br>You cannot imagine - the stone is here with me.
    <br>A big stone flew from the opposite direction straight to the same humble home
    <br>and landed on the exact net where I was lying.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>No one knows how Baby Joshua moved from the net to the other side of the room.
    <br>What happened to the mother?
    <br>She fainted, went into a coma and was carried to the hospital.
    <br>The guests and the people waiting for the ceremony were saying, "What happened?
    <br>We are here to see the child who spent 15 months in the womb and was delivered.
    <br>This is what happened.
    <br>The baby was saved."
    <br>Out of sheer wonder and surprise, they started voicing different names.
    <br>Temitope, Tope, Temidire, Temioluwa, Temidayo – different names.
    <br>I decided to choose Temitope out of those names.
    <br>Are you ready to watch the stone?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK, please watch.
    <br>The Town Where Prophet T.B. Joshua Was Brought Up – Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria
    <br>In 1963, a humble home, in a rural district of Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria, became the scene
    <br>of an incredible miracle; a child had finally been born, after 15 months in his mother's womb.
    <br>However, anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>The devil attempted to snatch away this young life, just days later,
    <br>but what the devil meant for evil, God meant for good.
    <br>Moving through the compound, we arrive at the small house in which Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>was raised and spent his childhood days.
    <br>A closer inspection of the roof reveals a noticeably large hole.
    <br>What could possibly have happened to create such damage?
    <br>A Hole In The Roof Of Prophet T.B. Joshua’s Childhood Home In Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria
    <br>Peering through the hole, a jagged stone can be seen lying on the floor of this modest home.
    <br>Inside The Childhood Home Of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>This is the small room, in which Prophet T.B. Joshua grew up with his family.
    <br>This is a house with a remarkable story to tell.
    <br>A Hole In The Roof Of Prophet T.B. Joshua’s Childhood Home In Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria
    <br>Let someone who was there that day tell you the story and unravel the mystery.
    <br>In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
    <br>A water pipe was being dug at a nearby site and you were laid here, sleeping.
    <br>Shockingly, a stone flew from the site through this zinc and landed very close to where you were sleeping.
    <br>Where is the stone?
    <br>This is the very stone.
    <br>Has the stone been kept since then?
    <br>It is the very one. We did not throw it away ever since.
    <br>When they gave birth to you and you were about to be named.
    <br>This is where we all were sleeping and where we gave birth to all our children.
    <br>We did not sleep elsewhere.
    <br>If one could go outside, the broken part of the zinc that was covered is still visible.
    <br>You were laid here and the stone fell beside you.
    <br>Is this the particular stone?
    <br>This was the point it was broken.
    <br>Can you see it?
    <br>So, what happened to me?
    <br>Jesus rescued you and made you healthy.
    <br>I didn’t throw it away. It is part of history.
    <br>Somebody advised me to smoothen it and use it as a grinding stone but I refused
    <br>because of the mysterious and miraculous role God used it to play in this family.
    <br>It wasn’t like this on the day the incident occurred.
    <br>Eventually, however, we shall create a special box for the stone.
    <br>This was how you were laid on the ground; your mother slept close to you.
    <br>There was a local lamp near your mother’s head and a fire used to treat your mother’s stomach.
    <br>The stone suddenly crashed down near you. Before God and man, that was what happened.
    <br>Glory be to the name of the Lord.

    <br>I am his step-mother.
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY T.B. JOSHUA AT 55!!!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua’s Childhood Home In Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria
    <br>The stone they found when they were blasting rock – this is it.
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY T.B. JOSHUA AT 55!!!
    <br>The Stone That Flew Through The Roof And Landed Next To Where T.B. Joshua Lay At 7 Days Old
    <br>This is the stone; this is T.B. Joshua!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY T.B. JOSHUA AT 55!!!
    <br>I’m older than the stone, by seven days!
    <br>It came out on the seventh day, when I was about to be named.
    <br>So, the stone must be fifty...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Like I have said; we are not showing you this because we are saying we have arrived but
    <br>it is an encouragement to the weak, to those without fast legs and
    <br>those without human help, the under-privileged, that there is hope and Jesus is the hope.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, we will begin to show you from where the ministry started and the name - Synagogue Church of All Nations,
    <br>the foundation of the church; we will show you now - you will see.
    <br>All this is not acting; it’s real.
    <br>It’s a real record.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Walks Through The Town And Children Follow Him
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let us be seated. 
    <br>Amen!
    <br>In fact, I don’t know where to start.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>My coming into your midst is just to lay a foundation.
    <br>I am here to lay a foundation – that today, we start The Synagogue here!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The Synagogue has started here!
    <br>I have come to launch a good foundation for the church.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>You should know that this man always says things in proverbs.
    <br>They say that Jesus is coming.
    <br>All the elders here have been hearing from a young age that Jesus is coming.
    <br>We have been expecting His coming up until now and we are still preparing for it.
    <br>The reason Jesus has not come is because He wants you and I to repent from our sins
    <br>because He doesn’t want anyone to perish.
    <br>Have you repented?
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY T.B. JOSHUA AT 55!!!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The reason the coming of Jesus is delayed is because God wants you to repent.
    <br>Repent from your sin, so that you will not perish.
    <br>By the time Jesus comes, you will not perish; you will inherit the Kingdom of God.
    <br>Right from your childhood, you have been learning that Jesus will come like a thief in the night.
    <br>We have been waiting for the coming of Jesus.
    <br>The reason the coming of Jesus has been delayed is because of you and me.
    <br>Jesus wants you to repent; He doesn’t want you to perish.
    <br>By the time He comes, He can carry you to eternal life.
    <br>If Jesus should come and you have not repented, the coming of Jesus in your life has no meaning.
    <br>In order for the coming of Jesus to have meaning in your life, you need to repent.
    <br>You have to repent today and accept Jesus,
    <br>so that when Jesus comes, you can join Him in the Kingdom of God.
    <br>So, for me and my house – and I believe you are my house – we will serve the Lord.
    <br>Clap for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We thank God. Even if you want me to prostrate for you, I am ready!

    <br>LEISURE TIME WITH PROPHET TB JOSHUA
    <br>Leisure time with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Playing with nature is a leisure time with nature to ease tension and stress.
    <br>Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I want to encourage you to often find a natural environment to read your Bible
    <br>because natural environment is natural and free from distraction.
    <br>Nature itself enhances spirituality.
    <br>I often read my Bible in a calm and quiet environment
    <br>because the Bible is not like other books you can read anywhere and understand.
    <br>Understanding of the Bible is understanding the nature of God.
    <br>Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>It must be read in an enabling environment to understand it.
    <br>To live it, it must be read in an enabling environment.
    <br>To teach it, it can be read anywhere.
    <br>Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Leisure time - time to be refreshed and be renewed.
    <br>God's Word refreshes our mind, God's Spirit renews our strength.
    <br>Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>You can now see the kind of man you are celebrating is not a superstar;
    <br>he is a man of the people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How do we celebrate this kind of man?
    <br>You can see, he is not a superstar.
    <br>He is a man of people.
    <br>If he is a man of people, let us look for people who need what we have.
    <br>People who are in need – look for them; that is how to celebrate him.
    <br>He is a man of people.
    <br>The man we are seeing is a man of people.
    <br>There is no way a man can be raised in such a simple and humble family background
    <br>and now turn to a superstar; it is not possible.
    <br>This is a man of people; to celebrate him, you must look for those who are in need,
    <br>people that are in need of what you have – your love, your care – look for them.
    <br>Someone is out there who needs your care.
    <br>Someone is out there who needs your money.
    <br>Someone is out there who needs your love.
    <br>Someone is out there who needs your smile – look for them.
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Happy Birthday!
