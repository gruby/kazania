  <p>    
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name!
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Happy New Year!"
    <br>Now I want you to turn to your neighbour and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>in this new year 2020, keep your eyes on God,
    <br>not on the means He might use."
    <br>Once again, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>keep your eyes on God, not on the means He might use."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>God alone is the Source of our expectations."
    <br>Now, tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>cut down your expectations of people and step up your expectations of God,
    <br>because God is not a man, who disappoints."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Yes, brethren, God is not a man who disappoints.
    <br>If you trust in yourself this new year, you are doomed to disappointment.
    <br>If you trust in your friends, neighbours, family, remember one day they can die and leave you.
    <br>But if you put your trust in Jesus Christ, you will never be confounded in time or eternity.
    <br>If you put your trust in Jesus Christ, you will walk in victory
    <br>even in the midst of adversity because God is reliable.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>God is reliable.
    <br>God is dependable.
    <br>God is trustworthy.
    <br>I put my trust in Him alone".
    <br>Do you know the reason why I have begun today's message in this tone?
    <br>Today it is so common for people to rely on those who are unreliable,
    <br>for people to depend on those who are not dependable,
    <br>for people today to put their trust in people who are not trustworthy.
    <br>And when you do this, what happens?
    <br>You set yourself up for disappointment.
    <br>You open the door to disappointment, to bitterness, to resentment, to hurt
    <br>because you trust those who are not trustworthy.
    <br>The truth is that we are living in a danger zone
    <br>where the Bible says, "Everyone lies to his neighbour."
    <br>Whom can we believe? Only God.
    <br>There is no other source of truth in this world,
    <br>there is no other source of reliability in this world outside of Jesus Christ.
    <br>He is still the steadfast One, still trustworthy, still reliable.
    <br>That is who our God is.
    <br>So today, I want to talk about a principle that must anchor your life throughout this new year 2020.
    <br>And the principle is very simply this:
    <br>LOVE EVERYONE BUT TRUST ONLY GOD
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>love everyone but trust only God."
    <br>Now, quickly turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of John 2
    <br>and I'm going to read from verses 24 to 25.
    <br>And the Bible reads thus:
    <br>"But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.
    <br>He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person."
    <br>Jesus knew, as the Bible says in Jeremiah 17:9,
    <br>that the heart of man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.
    <br>This is what Jesus knew; He knew what man is made of.
    <br>This is the reason why I want to talk about this principle for the new year.
    <br>LOVE EVERYONE BUT TRUST ONLY GOD
    <br>If you take a look at society today, and this is mirrored in our own lives as well,
    <br>if you examine yourself, you will discover
    <br>that many people today have imprisoned themselves with bitterness and resentment
    <br>because they have been disappointed by man,
    <br>they have been let down by those they look up to,
    <br>they have been hurt by those they helped,
    <br>they have been betrayed by those they least expected.
    <br>You can see examples of this everywhere in our society.
    <br>Many people today have invested so much in a particular business
    <br>and at the end of the day our business partner, that we invested so much in
    <br>turns around and dupes us.
    <br>What about relationships?
    <br>You see many people today entering a relationship emotionally,
    <br>investing in the relationship, thinking it may likely lead to marriage,
    <br>suddenly you find that your partner has been cheating on you behind your back.
    <br>In our work place, many people that we have trained up,
    <br>people that we have been teaching and our apprentices -
    <br>some of them later turn against us after all that we have done.
    <br>What about that person you thought was a friend and you confided in them privately
    <br>about your personal life, about some challenges you were passing through.
    <br>Little did you know that that friend started using your own weakness against you
    <br>and gossiping about you behind your back.
    <br>Or the person you've done good to, you've helped, you've done good to them, you've supported them
    <br>and they repay you with evil.
    <br>All of these scenarios that happen commonly in our society today
    <br>have caused people to become bitter, discouraged, depressed, cold-hearted.
    <br>In some extreme scenarios, which we unfortunately see played on our television channels
    <br>and on the pages of newspapers
    <br>you see people today even commit suicide because they have been disappointed by men.
    <br>We hear that, "My girlfriend left me" - the person committed suicide.
    <br>You hear, "This businessman that I invested so much in, he deceived me" -
    <br>the person committed suicide.
    <br>You end your life because you have been disappointed or betrayed by men.
    <br>I want to ask you today - examine yourself.
    <br>Have you ever been disappointed by someone?
    <br>Have you ever been betrayed by someone that you least expected?
    <br>Brethren, let's not deceive ourselves - it's painful!
    <br>Yes, it is painful!
    <br>People of God,
    <br>if you close your hearts from helping others
    <br>because of a bad experience you had in the past,
    <br>if you become bitter over betrayal, if you become discouraged over disappointments,
    <br>then you only serve to fulfill satan's purpose to take you out of the will of God.
    <br>A bitter heart cannot serve God in Spirit and truth.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says, and I quote,
    <br>If you leave one relationship embittered and resentful,
    <br>you will enter the next relationship with the same attitude."
    <br>What happens?
    <br>Carryover.
    <br>The cycle of hurt, the cycle of disappointment only seems to continue.
    <br>If you are not careful, and you leave a relationship embittered and resentful,
    <br>you may find yourself being used by satan to inflict that same hurt, disappointment on another relationship.
    <br>What am I here to tell you, brethren?
    <br>It is not worth damaging your heart for the sake of mere flesh and blood.
    <br>Isaiah 2:22 reads thus:
    <br>"Stop trusting in mere humans, who have but a breath in their nostrils..."
    <br>For everyone who is here today, everyone watching all over the world,
    <br>we all have our individual beginning and end.
    <br>Only God has no beginning and end.
    <br>In our journey through this world we must never forget that we are just in a market.
    <br>No matter how long you live here, you will one day leave here.
    <br>We have our beginning and we have our end.
    <br>Only God has no beginning and end.
    <br>That is why trust is reserved for God, not man,
    <br>because that person who said he will pay your debts back next week,
    <br>do you know whether he will be around next week?
    <br>That person who promises, "Yes, I'm going to play this, do this,
    <br>I'm going to keep my end of the bargain" -
    <br>do you know what will happen to them in two or three weeks or one month's time,
    <br>when James 4 says that
    <br>life is like a mist, vapour that appears for a while and then disappears.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>I love you but I don't trust you
    <br>because you have a beginning and you have an end."
    <br>I only trust in God who has no beginning and no end.
    <br>Do you know the reason why you should love everyone and trust only God?
    <br>Because tomorrow is a mystery.
    <br>You may own now, you may hold now but God owns tomorrow; God holds next.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>I love you but I don't trust you because tomorrow is a mystery."
    <br>Only God holds tomorrow.
    <br>That is why we must stop putting our hope and our confidence in man.
    <br>I'm not saying we should not love everyone,
    <br>this is what the title of this message tells us:
    <br>LOVE EVERYONE BUT TRUST ONLY GOD
    <br>When I say, "Love everyone", I am referring to the love for Christ's sake,
    <br>not love for selfish, classic or material reasons - you know "tit for tat",
    <br>"I give you but I expect this" - no.
    <br>I am talking about love without expectation, love without conditions or strings attached.
    <br>When you love someone without expecting something back from the person you are giving
    <br>then you are sowing seeds in the Spirit.
    <br>The challenge we have today is that we have certain expectations from those we give to.
    <br>We expect them to at one point reciprocate
    <br>or we expect them to appreciate or say, "Thank you."
    <br>We expect certain behaviour from those we give to.
    <br>And perhaps when the opposite occurs;
    <br>we help someone and later that same person turns around and turns against us -
    <br>when such a situation happens, what do we do?
    <br>We close our hearts, "Why should I help more people?
    <br>The person I helped - look at what happened to me."
    <br>And thus you step out of the will of God.
    <br>When you give to someone, their reaction should not determine your action.
    <br>Whether they reciprocate or not, keep giving.
    <br>Whether they appreciate or not, keep helping.
    <br>Whether they say, "Thank you" or not, keep sharing.
    <br>Because you are sowing seeds to the Spirit.
    <br>Let me try and practicalize this for you.
    <br>If I could just have one volunteer, please.
    <br>OK, thank you very much, sir.
    <br>This is a very simple illustration.
    <br>Now, our brother here is person "A".
    <br>As a Christian, I want to give something to my brother.
    <br>I'm going to bless him with this beautiful apple.
    <br>My brother, there you go. 
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>This is from my heart to you.
    <br>When I give this to my brother, the moment I give it,
    <br>I should not expect certain behaviour from him.
    <br>Many of us today, when we give we expect the person to come and say, "Thank you."
    <br>Or we expect the person, later on if we face our own trouble,
    <br>we expect the person to come and also help us,
    <br>we expect the person to pay us some respect,
    <br>we expect the person to treat us in a certain way because we have given to them.
    <br>But Prophet T.B. Joshua says this and I quote,
    <br>"It is better to give to those who are ungrateful than to give to those who are grateful,
    <br>for then we will have God as our Paymaster."
    <br>The problem today is that when I put up certain expectations of my brother because I've helped him
    <br>what I am doing is setting myself up for disappointment.
    <br>Because who knows tomorrow?
    <br>Only God.
    <br>The brother I've helped today, tomorrow he may turn to someone who lies against me.
    <br>He may turn to someone that betrays me.
    <br>He may turn to someone that spreads false rumours about me,
    <br>despite the fact that I've given to him.
    <br>If I have now put my expectations on him, I will set myself up for bitterness,
    <br>set myself up for disappointment, set myself up for resentment.
    <br>That is how many of us close our hearts
    <br>and stop helping people because of a negative experience we have had.
    <br>Remember what I said at the beginning of this message: Keep your eyes on God,
    <br>not on the means He might use.
    <br>By the time I give this to Mr. "A"...
    <br>Sir, you can go back to your seat with that blessed apple.
    <br>I may have given him, I have forgotten about it,
    <br>whether he said, "Thank you", appreciated, reciprocated or not,
    <br>by the time I face a challenge of my own;
    <br>what I have given to Mr. "A", God is going to put it in the heart of Mr. "B" to come and help me.
    <br>Someone who was not there when I gave him, who didn't know the response, the reaction,
    <br>because I have sown seeds to the Spirit...
    <br>When you sow the love of God, you shall reap the love of God.
    <br>Whether the person says, "Thank you" or not,
    <br>whether the person appreciates you or not,
    <br>God will now put it in the heart of person "B"; God can use any means
    <br>and he will now come and give me what I was looking for.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>cut down on your expectations of men and step up your expectations of God."
    <br>Love everyone; trust only God.
    <br>Thank you very much, sir.
    <br>Take an apple.
    <br>It is better to give to the ungrateful than to give to the grateful,
    <br>for then we shall have God as our Paymaster.
    <br>People of God, as I draw this message to a conclusion,
    <br>I want you to take a lesson from the case of Peter in Luke 5.
    <br>Peter sat frustrated and disappointed by the seaside.
    <br>The disappointment could be written all over his face,
    <br>after a night of toiling and struggling without any seeming reward.
    <br>And in that critical moment Jesus Christ met Peter and told him,
    <br>"Put down your net for a catch."
    <br>The anger and the frustration in Peter were enough to provoke an emotional outburst
    <br>but even though Peter was burning on the inside, he kept his cool and he said,
    <br>"Lord, if You say so - the Author and Finisher of my faith,
    <br>the Lord of the winds and the waves -
    <br>if You say so, I will let down the net for a catch."
    <br>In other words, he was simply saying this: "I know that if I labour by Your order
    <br>and under Your direction, I cannot labour in vain."
    <br>This same principle applies to everyone here and everyone watching today.
    <br>If you labour under God's direction, you cannot labour in vain.
    <br>What you have been doing; the prayers and tears of many years,
    <br>the good works that you have been doing in private that no one saw,
    <br>that word of encouragement you gave to that distressed and depressed brother,
    <br>that smile you gave to the person who looked downcast,
    <br>that time you introduced Emmanuel TV to that person in bondage of addiction and they received their freedom,
    <br>that time you just gave a small bit of money to that person on the street,
    <br>that was in such a terrible situation -
    <br>God has a record of what you have done.
    <br>They will issue you into beauty and glory.
    <br>God is faithful to fulfill His promises.
    <br>He is not a man that disappoints.
    <br>Whatever you have done for God's sake, the reward is great.
    <br>Don't give up.
    <br>Don't become bitter because of betrayal.
    <br>Don't become hard-hearted because of hurt.
    <br>Don't become disillusioned because of disappointment.
    <br>Don't close your heart to help because of negative experiences in the past.
    <br>That's faith.
    <br>Faith is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is reliable, dependable, trustworthy.
    <br>God cannot fail.
    <br>So brethren, in conclusion:
    <br>If this principle anchors you throughout the new year 2020 -
    <br>love everyone; trust only God - nothing will shake your faith in God,
    <br>nothing will separate you from the love of God,
    <br>nothing will affect your relationship with God.
    <br>I can say this with such assurance
    <br>because the message I've given today;
    <br>if there is anyone who exemplifies this message "Love everyone; trust only God" -
    <br>it is Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I have seen personally the facts that no person, no man has come in between him
    <br>and his relationship with God.
    <br>He continues to give, to support, to invest irrespective of whether the people reciprocate or not
    <br>because he knows he is sowing to the Spirit.
    <br>And today we are all beneficiaries of the reward that God is continually giving him.
    <br>LOVE EVERYONE BUT TRUST ONLY GOD
    <br>Help your neighbour but don't put your hope in them.
    <br>Care for your neighbour but don't put your confidence in them.
    <br>Love your neighbour but don't trust them.
    <br>Trust is reserved for God, who has no beginning and no end.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
