  <h3>
    2004
  </h3>
  <p>    
    <br>My name is Ignatius Dijeh.
    <br>I'm a Nigerian; I stay in Botswana.
    <br>I consider myself a Christian, an active Christian for that matter.
    <br>I pray, I counsel people as a service at my church, I hold responsibility,
    <br>I advise people and I am an elder in my church.
    <br>When I looked at my life, I found out that I did have problems.
    <br>I had a problem of inconsistency in activities, in relationships
    <br>and even in business relationships.
    <br>The greatest point that the spiritual entanglement
    <br>manifested in my physical life was in my marital life.
    <br>I run a pharmacy business but I'm not a pharmacist by profession.
    <br>I hire pharmacists
    <br>but just like any other staff I would employ, they would hardly stay with me.
    <br>You employ people today; tomorrow, they leave your employment.
    <br>In the situation of trying to save my business, I was not yet married then,
    <br>I decided that if I got married to a pharmacist, it would help me
    <br>and we could manage our business as a family.
    <br>With that thought, I sent word to my family at home that I needed a wife
    <br>and that the condition was that she should be a pharmacist
    <br>so that we could manage our business together.
    <br>That was done in 2006.
    <br>It is a tradition in our place that if you are abroad
    <br>and you need to get married, your people would arrange for the marriage.
    <br>They would get you a wife.
    <br>By way of communication, you would see pictures
    <br>and if you feel that it is OK, you come home and get married.
    <br>That happened to me in 2006.
    <br>Precisely December 17, 2006, I came from Botswana
    <br>and by December 23, I was in the church being wedded to my wife.
    <br>I went back to my business place.
    <br>We never courted before; we never met before our marriage.
    <br>Two years later after she finished school, she joined me
    <br>and there my problem of inconsistency in relationships and affairs started.
    <br>It all started as I picked my wife up from the airport that day.
    <br>As we were coming home, there wasn't any chat or excitement.
    <br>I didn't feel happy picking up my wife.
    <br>It was as if I was just a driver sent to pick somebody up.
    <br>I was just concerned about driving
    <br>and in my head I was asking myself, "What am I doing?"
    <br>By the time we got home, I never felt any affection for my wife;
    <br>I saw her as just another room-mate.
    <br>That really caused a very big strain.
    <br>At a stage, I even asked for a miracle for me to realise that I was with my wife
    <br>and not just another man in the house.
    <br>The lady was really going through hell.
    <br>Nevertheless, I was in a world of my own.
    <br>All my concern was to wake up in the morning, go to my business and come back at night.
    <br>At night, when I was coming back,
    <br>when I remembered that I was going back home to this woman,
    <br>I would rather prefer spending more time outside before going home.
    <br>Eventually, we managed to meet and she became pregnant.
    <br>By the time she was four months pregnant, I could no longer manage it.
    <br>Fortunate enough, she had her family in the USA,
    <br>so I arranged and sent her to one of her sisters
    <br>on the basis of going to have our baby in the USA as if that was my wish.
    <br>Actually, it wasn't my wish.
    <br>It was a way of trying to get her out of my life.
    <br>During the time she was in the USA for the childbearing,
    <br>I was hopeful and wishing that she would change her mind and never come back to me.
    <br>I felt that it was a problem I got for myself, not a wife.
    <br>When she had the baby, I wasn't excited.
    <br>After six months, by persuasion, I agreed that she could come back.
    <br>When she came back with the baby after six months,
    <br>I went to the airport as I had done before.
    <br>After I had taken enough time to attend to my business, they were waiting at the airport.
    <br>When I picked her up from the airport, I wished that I would have known
    <br>so that I could've arranged for a hotel where I could've put them,
    <br>instead of taking them to my house.
    <br>We came home on a Wednesday and by Friday, I put them back on a flight to Nigeria.
    <br>Until the time they left, all I was doing was making sure she called it a day.
    <br>Any slightest call if I was at work and was happy,
    <br>once the phone rang and I picked it up, and it was my wife, I would become annoyed.
    <br>This thing continued and I no longer wanted to be in the marriage.
    <br>I would rather sacrifice everything and walk out on the marriage.
    <br>This thing was happening in 2009.
    <br>Between 2009 and now...
    <br>Between 2009 and now, I was going out and no longer looking for a wife.
    <br>All I wanted was just to have children here and there.
    <br>I felt that because in the society now, people accept single parenthood
    <br>that I could always take care of the children but not have to put a wife into my house.
    <br>It happens that as I am standing here, I have four kids.
    <br>My wife was not aware of these incidents.
    <br>Of these four children, only one is my daughter in my marriage
    <br>and three kids outside my marriage with three different women.
    <br>Each one was like a programmed activity.
    <br>I was just there and this thing kept happening.
    <br>I didn't even have a reason to talk to anybody because in my head,
    <br>there was something I was thinking about and was telling me that, that was OK.
    <br>I found myself with the principles that I had learnt from childhood
    <br>turned overnight into what I was seeing -
    <br>believing what I saw and no longer what I had in my head.
    <br>It was as if my head did not belong to me.
    <br>It was actually true.
    <br>It was the frustration in my business that brought down the memories.
    <br>All I had been praying was for the man of God to help me.
    <br>First and foremost, he needed to reconcile me with my family.
    <br>Of everything in my life, I could let go but not my wife and my daughter.
    <br>I am pleading with the man of God to please help me to recover my family first.
    <br>I cannot continue listening to this - it is very touching.
    <br>He is crying.
    <br>He says it is like his head is no longer his own head.
    <br>He has three different women outside, different children; each child - each woman.
    <br>After that deliverance on Sunday, we called him; he started telling us what happened.
    <br>I am happy.
    <br>Immediately, we asked for the telephone number of the wife.
    <br>I called the woman.
    <br>For so long he was separated with the dear woman.
    <br>The woman, hearing our voice, came down.
    <br>Will She FORGIVE Him For Having THREE KIDS Out Of Wedlock?!?
    <br>I want to see the woman, please.
    <br>After listening to Mr Ignatius Dijeh, Prophet T.B. Joshua started the reconciliation
    <br>by personally going into the midst of the congregation to bring Mr Dijeh's wife,
    <br>who was invited with her daughter to The SCOAN,
    <br>to be reconciled back to her husband.
    <br>With his arm tenderly wrapped around her shoulders,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua guides her to the altar,
    <br>where she and her husband will be reunited after 3 long years of separation.
    <br>This is the first time in 3 years that he is setting eyes on them.
    <br>Tears roll down Mr Dijeh's face.
    <br>She wants to clean your eyes - please, let her clean your eyes.
    <br>Little one - let me give you my handkerchief.
    <br>Take it - you can use it to clean your mum.
    <br>Will She FORGIVE Him For Having THREE KIDS Out Of Wedlock?!?
    <br>Just hearing T.B. Joshua, The Synagogue,
    <br>the woman said whatever the case, she cannot disobey the man of God,
    <br>she has to come and explain herself.
    <br>That is why she is here today.
    <br>We are not going to deceive her, we will tell her the mind of God.
    <br>She is a Christian, she realises that in every situation, God has something to say.
    <br>Let me hear what God said to this man - that is why she is here.
    <br>She is not here to be the man here, but she is here...
    <br>I want to hear what God is speaking to this man,
    <br>what message God had given to this man to me - that is why she is here.
    <br>She is here to hear, "What does God say?"
    <br>"What message does this man have for me?" - that is why she is here.
    <br>And this is the beautiful little girl, looking like the father.
    <br>You have seen - the woman is really crying.
    <br>You have seen what happened, it was never her will.
    <br>This is the work of satan.
    <br>Satan just wants to destroy the house.
    <br>But today we thank God, we are able to live to see.
    <br>Look at what happened today.
    <br>And your husband was here to ask God to bless his business,
    <br>but suddenly the Lord went straight to the root of the problem.
    <br>I really want to salute you.
    <br>Because you knew a time like this was coming - that is why you have been waiting.
    <br>You have been waiting for a time like this.
    <br>If not, you would have messed up your life.
    <br>But today, you refuse to mess up your life.
    <br>You wait for a time like this.
    <br>Assume she had messed up her life - no more reconciliation.
    <br>At a time like this - we could not call her to come here.
    <br>In fact, she would say, "Man of God, I need to ask permission from so and so person",
    <br>and I would not even allow her to come here.
    <br>Because she knew that a time like this was coming,
    <br>she knew that satan is a liar, she has been waiting for a time like this.
    <br>Now, the time has come.
    <br>Will She FORGIVE Him For Having THREE KIDS Out Of Wedlock?!?
    <br>I really want to salute you.
    <br>What a wonderful woman is this.
    <br>Look at my little one.
    <br>The little one doesn't even know the father.
    <br>Will She FORGIVE Him For Having THREE KIDS Out Of Wedlock?!?
    <br>For you to know - satan is a liar.
    <br>Who is this?
    <br>Say, "It's daddy."
    <br>It's daddy.
    <br>I am very sorry. Help me plead with my wife to forgive me.
    <br>This is the ministry of broken homes and reconciliation.
    <br>I am so sorry.
    <br>I was confused; it wasn't me.
    <br>It won't happen again.
    <br>Please, come home.
    <br>Please, I am so sorry.
    <br>Forgive me, please.
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>We are not fighting flesh and blood.
    <br>You understand that.
    <br>Our husband is not our enemy; our wife is not our enemy.
    <br>Our children are not our enemy, but spirit beings.
    <br>It is not this flesh or the appearance you are seeing
    <br>that is fighting you or that is destroying the marriage.
    <br>It is not this appearance that you are looking at that we are fighting,
    <br>but that spirit being, the devil.
    <br>So, please.
    <br>I want to join your family.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Will She FORGIVE Him For Having THREE KIDS Out Of Wedlock?!?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>She says, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Will She FORGIVE Him For Having THREE KIDS Out Of Wedlock?!?
    <br>Can you help me to take them to the restaurant, let them be there and have a chat.
    <br>Madam, come once for all because
    <br>when you are coming next week, it is thanksgiving
    <br>but it is better I should speak my mind now,
    <br>what God deposited in my heart.
    <br>You are a mother; you are everything.
    <br>I am going to join you in this battle; I am going to join this family.
    <br>Our duty now is - this is the child of the house.
    <br>But those children at home, we need to ask where they are
    <br>so that we can take care of them.
    <br>You are a mother.
    <br>This is the child of the home.
    <br>We still have to ask of those children, we want to see them
    <br>so we can take care of those children.
    <br>You are a mother.
    <br>We are going to ask of those children and bring them home;
    <br>take care of these children.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Will She FORGIVE Him For Having THREE KIDS Out Of Wedlock?!?
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>After a touching reconciliation at The SCOAN,
    <br>where God Almighty used His servant Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to reunite Mr Ignatius Dijeh and his wife and daughter,
    <br>they now fellowship together and enjoy a delicious meal
    <br>in the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>This is the first time Mr Ignatius Dijeh is seeing his wife and daughter in a very long time.
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>Remember, satan comes only to kill, steal, destroy and separate marriages,
    <br>but Jesus Christ has come to give life, peace, joy, goodness and restoration to families.
    <br>You can see the love and affection in the Dijeh family has been rekindled,
    <br>after Mr's Ignatius Dijeh's deliverance at The SCOAN.
    <br>The joy has been restored.
    <br>The love has been restored.
    <br>And the peace has been restored.
    <br>This can only be the wonderful work of the Repairer and Restorer - Jesus Christ.
    <br>He is the solution to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>A million thanks are not enough for what Jesus Christ has done in this family.
    <br>A fresh beginning has come to the Dijeh family.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>The following Sunday, Mr. Ignatius Dijeh and his wife
    <br>came back to The SCOAN to testify to God's glorious grace
    <br>for reconciling their marriage and reuniting their home.
    <br>Let's hear from him.
    <br>My name is Uju Dijeh, and the man standing beside me is my husband - Mr Ignatius Dijeh.
    <br>And this is our beautiful daughter.
    <br>Last week, Sunday, we came for reconciliation.
    <br>I just want to testify what God has done in our marital life.
    <br>Our marital life was almost at breaking point
    <br>but with the intervention of God everything came back to normal.
    <br>I want to tell the people out there that we are now living a normal life.
    <br>The man I fell in love with and married is now a much better man
    <br>than the man I married in 2006.
    <br>I just want to give God the glory for doing this wonderful thing in our family.
    <br>I pray that it would be permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>What advice do you have for couples in the world who would learn from your experience?
    <br>My advice is that they should not give up because I know some couples,
    <br>especially women might have a worse case than mine.
    <br>There were three principles I applied in this:
    <br>I call it, "Triple 'P' - prayer, persistence and patience."
    <br>So, that is what worked.
    <br>In any way, all you have to do is to be prayerful.
    <br>However the man might be behaving, just keep loving him
    <br>because it was the love that sustained me and the relationship.
    <br>That was why I was able to reconcile finally with him.
    <br>I will tell everybody out there to be prayerful and persistent.
    <br>My name is Mr Ignatius Dijeh.
    <br>The woman standing by me is my wife - Mrs Uju Dijeh.
    <br>This is my beautiful daughter.
    <br>My testimony or thanksgiving after the reconciliation I experienced.
    <br>Before my deliverance, I had been living a kind of solitude and lonely life.
    <br>I kept everything personal to myself until it got to a breaking point
    <br>whereby I lost my whole world.
    <br>After my deliverance and reconciliation with my wife,
    <br>for these past few days we've stayed together,
    <br>it appears as if for the first time, I discovered the new life.
    <br>It was as if we were just starting our honeymoon.
    <br>I am just seeing how beautiful and wonderful my daughter is.
    <br>Since our reconciliation, we don't want to spend a minute apart;
    <br>we are staying very close and are very happy as a family.
    <br>I want to take the opportunity to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for his assistance.
    <br>I give all glory to God for making it possible for us to come back together as a family.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>How do you see your wife now?
    <br>She is a very beautiful woman, loving and caring.
    <br>We thank God for the wonderful reconciliation of this home.
    <br>I will advise people not to keep things to themselves,
    <br>especially when you are passing through some problems.
    <br>Endeavour to share your views with an encouraging and understanding society
    <br>or friends that will be able to give you a sincere opinion.
    <br>Most importantly, run to God and apply God's principles
    <br>and seek God's opinion and assistance.
    <br>He will definitely see you through - even at the very last dying moment.
    <br>Amen. We know that definitely, whatever situation we are going through,
    <br>I think you have learnt through this that we need to forgive
    <br>because we also need to be forgiven,
    <br>and we know that forgiveness makes the future possible,
    <br>and the right knowledge of God, through the intervention of deliverance in your life
    <br>has truly brought and settled peace in this home.
    <br>We want to encourage you to continue to make Jesus Christ the centre of this marriage and home,
    <br>so that you will never be disappointed, in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
