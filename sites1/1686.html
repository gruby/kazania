    <br>PROPHECY FOR 2020!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>I know - this is the first week of the year.
    <br>I must come out to join you "double double".
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The reason I'm here is to bring out the A, B, C messages for this year.
    <br>PROPHECY FOR 2020!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>I'm going to give you the 'A' right now.
    <br>The reason I'm coming out to give this is because events have begun to take over.
    <br>Some of the messages I received at the mountain on the 27th, 28th have happened
    <br>but I was waiting for the 'B' and 'C' so that I can have them comprehensively.
    <br>And you know this thing has to do with integrity.
    <br>When T.B. Joshua says 'A' and it's not like that next year, they will say, 'Prophet of doom'.
    <br>So when you want to say something on behalf of God, you must make sure it's God that sent you.
    <br>So they will read 'A' for you now and you will be waiting for 'B' maybe next week.
    <br>I have to release this prophecy because events have begun to take over.
    <br>A good example is this, which was given since the 28th of December.
    <br>We just compiled it.
    <br>An incident will happen to the nation, Iran that will cause panic throughout the world.
    <br>We are praying to know the mind of God concerning this.
    <br>That was on 27 December but see what happened three days ago.
    <br>Remember last year what God said through us, that the year was very, very fearful.
    <br>That was last year.
    <br>It was just a summary I was telling you, but I was not giving you details
    <br>but you are able to see that indeed the last year was very...
    <br>That last year is still... it will end around March, by God's timetable.
    <br>I'm so concerned about what is going to happen this year,
    <br>If something wants to catch you, it should not catch you unprepared.
    <br>But I know you don't mind.
    <br>You don't mind but I am very, very concerned.
    <br>See what I'm talking about.
    <br>An incident will happen to the nation, Iran that will cause panic throughout the world.
    <br>OK, I will leave it to the evangelists to take over.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>PROPHECY FOR 2020!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>Our prayer warriors are on their knees praying to make sure the changeable ones are changed.
    <br>Prophecy is a guide to life.
    <br>This is the Word of God.
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>These prophecies were released on 28 December 2019
    <br>but made available on 5 January 2020.
    <br>I will read just a few and the rest you will find on our official social media accounts.
    <br>PROPHECY FOR 2020 - PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Prophecy For The World:
    <br>1. This year will be a year of HUMILITY.
    <br>This year, the Lord will humble us with our challenges.
    <br>Challenges can be affliction, arrogance, pride, wickedness or bad habits.
    <br>To humble us with these is for those things to destroy us or expose us.
    <br>Let us move closer to God.
    <br>Are we clear with the first prophecy?
    <br>2. Agriculture will help the economy because the economy will have a backlash.
    <br>People should invest in agriculture.
    <br>Let us farm to help the economy.
    <br>3. There will be a common medicine that will cause people to be 'high' to die,
    <br>to commit suicide, to think of what can lead to death.
    <br>The governments of each nation should watch out and put a check on pharmaceutical drugs
    <br>that come to their country.
    <br>Are we clear with the third prophecy?
    <br>4. America should invest more in agriculture because their economy will be affected.
    <br>The economy they see today will be affected,
    <br>so they should invest in agriculture and encourage their farmers.
    <br>Also, approach to the security issue will affect the candidates and swing voters in the next election.
    <br>It will be tough in the election.
    <br>They should pray against a recount.
    <br>It may be too tight.
    <br>Remember that I'm reading just a few of the prophecies;
    <br>the rest you will find on our social media accounts.
    <br>5. Let us pray for the Nigerian government to be able to finish this year without an interlude
    <br>that will cause a situation of 'for and against'.
    <br>Join me in praying for my nation.
    <br>Is it clear?
    <br>6.Vice President, it is not yet over.
    <br>Expect much more pressure.
    <br>The pressure will be so much.
    <br>I pray you will be able to stand the pressure.
    <br>We join you in prayer.
    <br>Is it clear?
    <br>7. Many sicknesses and diseases that leaders have been treating privately will surface this year.
    <br>They will become bedridden and many will not make it.
    <br>8. Russia should pray for their leader to avert his being on the sickbed.
    <br>Something will surface.
    <br>There is a ladder to go up - if this is averted.
    <br>Are we clear?
    <br>The reason the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, is releasing this
    <br>is because there is a case that happened in Iran three days ago
    <br>which is part of the prophecies that were released on 28 December 2019.
    <br>If I may read that prophecy:
    <br>9. An incident will happen to the nation, Iran that will cause panic throughout the world.
    <br>We are praying to know the mind of God concerning this.
    <br>Don't forget, these prophecies were released on 28 December 2019
    <br>but are made available for you today, 5 January 2020
    <br>because some of the prophecies are coming to pass.
    <br>Therefore, there is a need to release part 1 so we can wait for part 2,
    <br>which will be made available for you on our official social media accounts.
    <br>10. Work of God - people will be getting tired this year
    <br>because the work of God is not by power and might;
    <br>because of so many challenges, tribulations and burdens they will not be able to bear.
    <br>Are we clear with the 10th prophecy?
    <br>11. United Kingdom -  there will be agitation from a section that wants to leave;
    <br>that will become an issue.
    <br>Also, pray for the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh against going in and out of the hospital;
    <br>pray for God to give them revival.
    <br>Pray for unity and understanding among the Royal Family -
    <br>because of what I am seeing.
    <br>Brexit needs more time to stand on its feet - with more cooperation of the EU leaders.
    <br>If not, there will be economic repercussions and the cost of things will become unbearable.
    <br>With time and preparation, all will be well.
    <br>Note: Part 2 will be released after thorough confirmation from God.
    <br>This is just part 1.
    <br>Part 2 will be released after thorough confirmation from God.
    <br>The rest will be made available on our official social media accounts.
    <br>Thank you and God bless you.
