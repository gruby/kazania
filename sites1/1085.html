    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>During a Sunday service, there is a seeming distraction in the congregation.
    <br>We can see here, a young man creating a scene.
    <br>Brother!
    <br>Please take it easy.
    <br>Come. What's wrong? Come.
    <br>I want to get married, I am not yet married.
    <br>You want to get married?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>And you are not yet married?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What a handsome man! Come.
    <br>He says, he wants to get married and he is not yet married - very handsome man. Don't worry.
    <br>Take one.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Go and wait for me. Okay? You will come back and give testimony here.
    <br>Somebody says he wants to get married - and you are blocking him?
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>My name is Deacon Prince Uche Anazodo, and this is my wife, my beautiful "pina pina".
    <br>Her name is Princess Kenechi Vivian Anazodo.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>You have already seen the clip.
    <br>It was a terrible situation.
    <br>Before I came to the SCOAN, I had this challenge of not being able to get married.
    <br>It was not ordinary.
    <br>It was a challenge.
    <br>It was a demonic conception.
    <br>I am a deacon, I had a challenge, in spite of my church commitment and what have you.
    <br>The time I intended to get married, I discovered that I couldn't get married.
    <br>It's either, I like the woman, she doesn't like me; or she likes me and I would not be able to like her.
    <br>And even if she likes me and I like her, it will not work.
    <br>In that scenario the lady in question died.
    <br>It was so terrible!
    <br>In fact, it came to a point where my father, who is late now, took it as a point of duty to get me married.
    <br>In fact, he took me to a lady.
    <br>At a point he said "My son, you have to get married".
    <br>It was like an embarrassment.
    <br>And you know, at that point I was downcased.
    <br>I had a lot of thoughts in me - suicidal and what have you.
    <br>But I remembered, there was a man, a man of God in the person of Prophet T.B. Joshua, the Senior Prophet.
    <br>Prince Uche and Princess Kenechi Anazodo - Prophesy Testimony
    <br>I took a decision to go to the pilgrimage.
    <br>You know, here is a "pilgrimage", here it's not just a church setting.
    <br>... to have an encounter with the man of God.
    <br>When I came - the church was actually winding up, and the man of God in the Synagogue
    <br>was not looking at my direction.
    <br>I said: "Wow! No, I can't go from here empty handed. God, You have to help me",
    <br>because I knew what it takes to see the man of God without him inviting you."
    <br>So, I prayed a simple prayer; I said: "Lord, have Your way."
    <br>From what you saw in the clip; I stood up, the ushers came running around me,
    <br>but God had to intervene because my case was desperate.
    <br>My case was different.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>When he beckoned on me, and he asked me: "Young man, what's the problem?"
    <br>I told him: "I want to get married. But I discovered that it was not ordinary. My own case is not an ordinary case."
    <br>He now said very simply I would come back and give my testimony.
    <br>I said: "Wow! So simple?"
    <br>God is a good Arrenger.
    <br>He had to arrange me and He gave me the favour.
    <br>Actually, I am an engineer, I install, satellite dishes, CCTV camera and what have you.
    <br>I got an arrangement and I started working in the palace, of the king of my town.
    <br>When I started working there...
    <br>It happened on certain wonderful day.
    <br>Her Majesty called me, she said they had a challenge.
    <br>I should come and see what was happening, what was the problem.
    <br>I went there, and before you could say...
    <br>I saw my wife now passing by.
    <br>I said: "Who is this person?"
    <br>They said, it was the daughter of the king, the daughter of Igwe.
    <br>I said: "Ah!"
    <br>Prince Uche & Princess Kenechi Anazodo - Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I went to her, I approached her, I introduced myself and she introduced herself.
    <br>She just graduated, she came back trying to prepare for her Youth Service.
    <br>We started talking and we exchanged our phone numbers.
    <br>She said that since I was into installation of satellite dishes,
    <br>when she gets where she would be posted, she would want me to come and install a satellite dish for her.
    <br>That was how it begun.
    <br>Before we knew it, it came from installing of a satellite dish to an installation of marriage.
    <br>And before you know it, it was an installation of pregnancy.
    <br>The God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua is the authentic, autocratic, authoritative God.
    <br>God of Prophet T.B. Joshua is the God, that is beyond human comprehension.
    <br>The "impossibility Specialist".
    <br>The God that knows the ending from the beginning.
    <br>I want to give Him all the Glory!
    <br>He is worthy.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>And brother, we would like to ask you;
    <br>when you came to the SCOAN and had this encounter with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>when you returned home, what was the reaction of people who saw you on Emmanuel TV crying out?
    <br>What did they tell you when you went home?
    <br>Actually, when I went home, they were laughing at me.
    <br>My friends, they were saying I went to the Synagogue to eat apple, "Where is the woman?"
    <br>It was not an easy encounter.
    <br>I was like: "Wow".
    <br>But today this is my woman.
    <br>You can see her live and direct.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen! Lets put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>And brother, we can see some pictures on the board there.
    <br>Could you describe to us what we are seeing here?
    <br>This is my court wedding certificate.
    <br>This is my white wedding certificate.
    <br>This is my court wedding.
    <br>You can see me here.
    <br>This is my "pina pina", my wife.
    <br>This is the court wedding.
    <br>This is the church wedding.
    <br>You can see me here.
    <br>This is my "pina pina", my princess.
    <br>This is the church event.
    <br>Let me introduce my father in law to you.
    <br>This is Igwe Doctor K.O.N. Orizu.
    <br>The Igwe Nnewi and this is the daughter.
    <br>This is the Igwe Orizo III,
    <br>Igwe Doctor K.N.O Orizo III.
    <br>Igwe Nnewi Traditional ruler of Nnewi Kingdom.
    <br>Ordinarily, there was no way I could have gotten married to the daughter of Igwe,
    <br>if not of God's intervention through the Prophet himself, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Amen! Lets put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>This is the traditional wedding.
    <br>In fact, I am overwhelmed, I am over-gusted, I am overwhelmed.
    <br>Glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Since you have got married you have enjoyed peace and love in this marriage
    <br>and the curse that didn't want you to get married has truly been broken.
    <br>Actually, my wife here, my wonderful, beautiful, joyful princess;
    <br>since I got married to her, I have been enjoying peace.
    <br>Very humble, as you see her, she is very humble to the core, very down to earth.
    <br>You know, just like my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua, humble.
    <br>So I want to give God the Glory.
    <br>She is wonderful woman, very peaceful.
    <br>She doesn't want trouble, she doesn't like trouble.
    <br>And the family is a wonderful family.
    <br>It was through divine arrangement because everything was divinely arranged.
    <br>You can't imagine me getting married to the daughter of Igwe - it was not possible.
    <br>Naturally, there was no way.
    <br>Indeed, this is divine arrangement, and we give all the glory to God Almighty,
    <br>for what He has done in the life of our brother here.
    <br>Do you mean to say sir, that in your family you have been facing this problem
    <br>of not being able to get married?
    <br>This has been a curse in the family but that curse has been broken, through your coming here?
    <br>Yes, it was actually a curse.
    <br>I am the only son - you know what that means.
    <br>If you have an only son, and your only son is not able to get married - you know what that means.
    <br>That means the lineage is going.
    <br>And when I knew it, I knew it was not a "church thing".
    <br>You have to go to seek the face of the field marshal.
    <br>We have generals actually, but we have a field martial.
    <br>And I had to go and seek the face of the field marshal, in the person of senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Amen! And today we can see the results in the life of our brother.
    <br>Right now we want hear a quick word from your wife as well, before coming back to hear you advice.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>My name is Princess Kenechi Vivian Anazodo.
    <br>When we were about to get married, it was a surprise to everybody.
    <br>People were like: "Are you sure this is the daughter of Igwe?" and all that.
    <br>In fact, they said many things.
    <br>But thank God.
    <br>One thing I know is that with God everything is possible.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>And today you are happily married to your husband.
    <br>You have listened to this wonderful testimony.
    <br>What can you say about what God has done?
    <br>God is a marvellous God, He is indeed wonderful.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus.
    <br>Finally, brother, we would like to hear your word of advice to our viewers all over the world
    <br>in the light of this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I would like to use this opportunity to advice my Christian brothers.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>It's good to be in a denomination but when you discover that your case had become a "chronic" case,
    <br>please my brothers, my sisters - run down to the SCOAN.
    <br>Run down to the SCOAN to have an encounter.
    <br>This is not a "church thing".
    <br>God is not interested in you being a church member.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>God is interested in you having an encounter with destiny and this is the place of destiny.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>This is the "pilgrimage ground".
    <br>People go to Israel for pilgrimage.
    <br>Please run down here, this is a "pilgrimage ground".
    <br>When you come here, you have an encounter with your destiny.
    <br>If you are not able to get married, just as I was,
    <br>you are going to come back with your wife to share the testimony in this place, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Amen. Lets put our hands for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank you, Jesus Christ!
    <br>We heard it all from our brother.
    <br>We know that our membership at our local church is merely symbolic.
    <br>What counts is Christ in us, the Hope of Glory.
    <br>We believe that as Christians, we are all one in the body of Christ.
    <br>On the last day when we stand before Jesus, the question will not be:
    <br>"Did you worship in this church or worship in this denomination?",
    <br>but the question will be: "Did you worship in Spirit and in Truth?"
    <br>We thank God for what He has done in the life of this couple.
    <br>We believe more and more testimonies are on the way.
    <br>As Prophet T.B Joshua says - better is not good enough the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Lets put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
