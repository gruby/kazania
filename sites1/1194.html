    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Come.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Where are you living?
    <br>I'm living in Sweden.
    <br>You have to live a proper life. The life you are living is not good.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>The life you are living is not good.
    <br>It's true, man of God.
    <br>You cannot continue living this life.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>What's next now? Even the document - you are due, you are not supposed to stay there till now.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Everything is expired, yet you are still living there.
    <br>And how can you live a life of fear? You are not free.
    <br>Yes, man of God. I have been living in Sweden. My child was taken
    <br>because they said that the way I train him is not the right way they train in Sweden.
    <br>Wait, do you listen to what I'm saying?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I say the life you are living is bad.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Not only your child. You too you were once in the custody of security.
    <br>Yes, man of God. It's true.
    <br>And your child is there now.
    <br>Yes, man of God. It's true.
    <br>They took away your child.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>That's what I am saying - the life you live. You have to change.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chamaka Anodu. We come from Sweden and the child beside me is Emmanuel Anodu.
    <br>- And who is he to you? 
    <br>- He is my son.
    <br>Last year was very very terrible for me. I was depressed, I became suicidal.
    <br>I was crying, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even eat.
    <br>I couldn't concentrate on my studies or on any other thing because my son was taken away.
    <br>So I had to come to The SCOAN immediately to seek the face of God.
    <br>What do you mean by your son was taken away?
    <br>My son was taken into custody by the authorities in Sweden
    <br>because he was stubborn in school, so I hit him.
    <br>He went to school and told his teachers; so they took him.
    <br>I had to run down to The SCOAN to seek the face of God.
    <br>And when I came, I was opportune out of the many people here...
    <br>I was oppurtune to receive the prophecy from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He told me the root cause of my problem and I confirm the whole prophecy to be true.
    <br>And he also mentioned that your child was in custody, right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So after my stay in The SCOAN, I went back to Sweden. We went to court again.
    <br>When we got to the court room, we spent more than seven hours
    <br>deliberating whether they would give me this child or not.
    <br>Even in the court room, I was praying, spraying the Morning Water and saying,
    <br>"God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, see me through!
    <br>You are the only One who can give me victory in this case".
    <br>After the court hearing, as I was going with the lawyer, the lawyer told me,
    <br>"You cannot win this case. It is very difficult for people to win cases like this".
    <br>I became scared.
    <br>But I picked up courage and said, "No, I have a God - the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And this God is bigger than any government of the world, and I will have victory in this case".
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>A statement of faith indeed.
    <br>After that she told me, "Let this your God save you, if He is true". I said okay.
    <br>A week later, she called me and said, "Congratulations".
    <br>Immediately she called me, I was scared.
    <br>She said, "Congratulations, this your God has saved you. You won the case".
    <br>Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>After the prophecy I went back to Sweden and made my life in the way God,
    <br>as the man of God said in the prophecy
    <br>and my academics which were not going well, started becoming better.
    <br>Now I have two Master's degrees - all by the grace of God and my son is with me also.
    <br>Hallelujah! So you mean after this message of prophecy from the man of God,
    <br>you went back to Sweden and the court case ended to your favour and your son was released
    <br>to you by the authorities. Is that right?
    <br>Yes. Even then, the court gave the other party three weeks to appeal this case, if they wanted -
    <br>but we did not hear from the other party;  they didn't say anything.
    <br>The court then gave me the instruction that I could go and take my son back.
    <br>I then went and brought him back.
    <br>That is why we are here today to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua for restoring my life
    <br>because then, I was depressed, I was running mental. I didn't know what to do.
    <br>But today, I am glowing in the Lord. Thank You, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Ok, now tell us, in a case like this, ordinarily - how long was your son supposed to spend in custody?
    <br>My case was very controversial and very difficult.
    <br>The court said my son was going to stay with them until he was eighteen years old.
    <br>And how old was your son?
    <br>He was 7 years old when he was taken.
    <br>I don't know how I could manage it and he would lack motherly care.
    <br>I said, "How will I manage this?" That was why I had to come.
    <br>And in these cases, a lot of people that have this problem - they have not received their children
    <br>but in my case, people were asking, "What is your secret? How did you do this?"
    <br>I said, "It is the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua that did it for me".
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God. Can we just hear from our little brother.
    <br>Hello. How are you?
    <br>Fine.
    <br>Tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Chisom.
    <br>And how old are you?
    <br>I am eight.
    <br>And the woman standing beside you - who is she to you?
    <br>She is my mother.
    <br>Your mother. And you are happy to be with your mother again?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, madam. We thank God Almighty for intervening in your situation.
    <br>And now that the battle is over, we want to encourage you to make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>and to bring up your son in the way of the Lord, so that when he grows up, he will not depart from it
    <br>and we pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is  Shemaclatta Chiamaka. I am a Nigerian but I live in Sweden.
    <br>And the boy next to me is my son, Emmanuel Anodu.
    <br>Last year, my son was taken away by the social authorities in Sweden
    <br>because of the correction I gave to him which he went to school and reported.
    <br>They decided that the child would not be coming home again.
    <br>He was taken into custody and put into a foster home where he stayed for that period.
    <br>I was not allowed to see him.
    <br>During the period my child was away, I was depressed, I had memory loss.
    <br>I couldn't concentrate, I was devastated.
    <br>I couldn't do anything. So that was the effect that it had on me.
    <br>One of the reasons why I was devastated and depressed,
    <br>was that it was a very controversial and tough case and it wasn't easy -
    <br>regarding the type of case that it was, involving a child and abuse.
    <br>I went to different people for help and advice and they told me that there was no way out
    <br>because a lot of families have lost their kids to the social authority
    <br>and it was very difficult for me to be able to get my son back.
    <br>So I had to run down to The SCOAN to seek the face of God concerning the situation.
    <br>I was opportune to receive a prophecy from the man of God
    <br>regarding my past life and concerning the issue of my child's case.
    <br>He told me that my son will be released and that everything will be fine.
    <br>And then I went back to Sweden.
    <br>Few weeks later, I was invited to the court in regards to the same case.
    <br>After the court  proceedings, the case was judged in my favour
    <br>and my son was released back to me which was a miracle.
    <br>So here I am today. I am happy, I thank God. I have my son beside me.
    <br>And everything is settled, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The joy of every mother is to be with their children and my joy has been restored, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. We give glory to God Almighty for what He has done in your life
    <br>and rejoice for this wonderful thing that God Almighty has done.
    <br>We would like to hear a word from your son.
    <br>My name is Chisom. I am from Stockholm, Sweden.
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>I am eight.
    <br>And who is the woman beside you?
    <br>My mum.
    <br>And how are you feeling now?
    <br>Good. I am happy to be home.
    <br>Wow! We rejoice with you that you are back home and we thank God Almighty.
    <br>We know that the best is yet to come in your lives, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The only advice I have for parents who are experiencing what I have passed through
    <br>is that with God, all things are possible, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen! Indeed, with God Almighty, all things are possible.
    <br>He is the final authority, answering all questions and settling all issues.
    <br>And we know that as He has settled your issues, He will also settle theirs in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>We rejoice with you once again for what God Almighty has done in your life.
    <br>Prophet T.B.Joshua, seeing what you have been through in the past -
    <br>just like you explained, you were devastated, you were disturbed,
    <br>like every mother would be - the man of God has sent us on behalf of himself and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>He is blessing you with a sum of 150 000 Naira for the upkeep of your son.
    <br>We know that the good Lord who has started His work in your life will definitely complete it
    <br>and we know that the best is yet to come.
    <br>All you need to do is continue to walk in the light of God
    <br>and train up this child in the way of God so that as he grows up, he will not depart from it, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen! I was not expecting this from the man of God, truly.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to thank the man of God for the gift of money and the Mirror book.
    <br>I also want to thank the man of God for his kindness, his assistance
    <br>and all the role he played during the time I ran down to The SCOAN for this help.
    <br>I also want to thank the man of God for the $1000 he gave to me when I came.
    <br>I am truly blessed with all the money he gave to me.
