  <p>    
    <br>For some time now, I've had a message for my country, South Africa.
    <br>I would have loved to share it with them because I had this message last November.
    <br>Some areas of South Africa will face drought - the time of rain, it will not rain.
    <br>Even if it should rain, it will look like it hasn't rained.
    <br>But they should not worry.
    <br>I am seeing January, February, March to April - we are praying for rain.
    <br>March to April - to recover the city back.
    <br>There are some parts of cities like North-East, Limpopo and others.
    <br>The rain will fall!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Next meeting, I will have time to share my vision with them.
    <br>There are two challenges they have now that will affect the country so badly:
    <br>power and drought.
    <br>What is the cause of this?
    <br>It's unusual - a country the other Africans in the past saw as Heaven on earth.
    <br>When there is no power, what else again?
    <br>It affects the companies and the foreigners will start leaving
    <br>because they cannot work or stay without power.
    <br>I saw this and I'm praying over it.
    <br>The issue of rain -
    <br>this February, March - by April,
    <br>you will recover your water back.
    <br>Three years ago, I said they should have a dam.
    <br>It is part of the prophecy that South Africa should prepare to have a dam.
    <br>But I think they took it for granted.
    <br>Thank you very much.
