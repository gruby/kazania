    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>I am Lawrence Kazungu Kilabo.
    <br>I am from Kenya, cost, Mombassa.
    <br>I used to be a counsellor, a ward representative in my area.
    <br>Before, I was working with a tourist company.
    <br>I come from a poor family.
    <br>My father was a prison officer.
    <br>He married four wives and every wife had ten children.
    <br>That is why I come from a poor family background. Before that
    <br>my father told his wives to feed themselves and their children.
    <br>So, life became very difficult for us.
    <br>That was why every mother moved out to the interior to look for food for her children.
    <br>That was why, after my education, I got a job with African Safari Club as a guide supervisor and waiter.
    <br>There, I started exhibiting bad character - sleeping with women, ten women in a day.
    <br>I was very strong.
    <br>Then, I was called a star man. Star
    <br>Then, I used to sleep with three, five or ten women after their arrival because I was organizer of arrivals.
    <br>Right now, I have twenty-five kids in different countries.
    <br>There are ten mothers; some are in the UK, USA, Israel, Colombia, India.
    <br>I was really a star then.
    <br>I used to visit witch doctors to seek for powers.
    <br>They gave me charms which I rubbed on my palms.
    <br>Whenever I fell in love with a woman, I would approach her, say, "Hi", and shake hands.
    <br>Then, she would look for me and in one or two days, she would come to me.
    <br>When she came, I would be ready.
    <br>I would just touch her and kiss her and that would be the end of her story.
    <br>I used this power to attract women and womanise - it was my life then.
    <br>Later, I went into politics and used my evil powers to gain positions: counselor.
    <br>During the last election, I wanted to become a member of parliament.
    <br>I consulted witch doctors but things did not go well..
    <br>It is really hurting me but I will try.
    <br>One day, I was in Tanzania and saw a witch doctor.
    <br>I told the witch doctor that I would like to win that seat or else, we would fight.
    <br>He told me not to worry that everything would be fine.
    <br>Before I left, he called on his gods and they appeared -
    <br>some as snakes, some as donkeys and some with human faces.
    <br>We sat together in the bush, talking with them.
    <br>We agreed and left and I went to my country.
    <br>So you physically saw these spirits?
    <br>I physically saw them - not only seeing them but talking with them.
    <br>I agreed with them but they failed to get me the parliamentary seat.
    <br>I spent about 50 million Kenyan Shillings.
    <br>At the end of this, I was having 74,000 in my account and I didn't go through.
    <br>This made me to change my mind and I began to ask myself, "What will I do for my future?"
    <br>So, I sat down with my wife and we chatted.
    <br>I thank my wife because she was the one who introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Mr Lawrence Kazungu Kilabo
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She told me more about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I touched the screen as Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying for the viewers.
    <br>That was why about three weeks ago, I decided to come here and meet the prophet.
    <br>I used to see Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV, not physically.
    <br>While Prophet T.B. Joshua was ministering, I was seated at the left side of the church.
    <br>He came over to me, touched me and I fell down.
    <br>I was on the floor for about 20 to 30 minutes and never knew he would come back to me.
    <br>He came back to me and with a nice voice said, "Brother, stand up. How are you?"
    <br>I said, "Fine".
    <br>After that, he touched me again and I fell; I did not know what happened after that.
    <br>Ok. So at that moment when he prayed for you,
    <br>you can't remember what happened at that point?
    <br>I don't remember at all.
    <br>He touched me and I fell down.
    <br>I didn't know what was going on.
    <br>Afterwards, I saw myself standing and people started singing.
    <br>Since last Sunday til now, people of God, wherever you are,
    <br>just look at me and see how strong and healthy I am.
    <br>It's a miracle.
    <br>To me, it's a miracle.
    <br>I have changed - everything.
    <br>No spirit comes to me to ask me anything because they know I'm in the House of the Lord.
    <br>Mr Lawrence Kazungu Kilabo
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I am really healthy.
    <br>At this point, sir, give us a word of advice.
    <br>You said you were someone that all your life, you have visited witch doctors,
    <br>consulted powers from the darkness and today, you are here in the light.
    <br>What is your word of advice concerning that to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>Oh, yes.
    <br>I would like to tell people all over the world, if there is a man like me, Lawrence,
    <br>please just come over here; you will get your blessing without fear.
    <br>I was really in the dark.
    <br>But today, my eyes are opened now.
    <br>Mr Lawrence Kazungu Kilabo
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Nothing will change my life; I will keep on singing and praising the Lord in this House forever.
    <br>Mr Lawrence Kazungu Kilabo
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>For those who are still looking here and there, I was there, talking with the devils and ghosts.
    <br>My friend, what are you waiting there for? Just come.
    <br>Mr Lawrence Kazungu Kilabo
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We thank God for your life, sir. We pray God will give you the grace
    <br>to continue to maintain this deliverance by making the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and we know the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen! Thank You, Jesus!
