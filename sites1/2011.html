    <br>Prophet TB Joshua is praying for those who have come to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations prayer line.
    <br>When the power of God is present, healing is like breathing.
    <br>Man of God, please help my husband. Please.
    <br>I'm booked for knee replacement surgery.
    <br>I need your help, man of God.
    <br>Help me.
    <br>I cannot walk.
    <br>I can't do anything on my own.
    <br>Help me, man of God.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua offers the prayer of faith over Mr Smiles' condition.
    <br>That is a man with a pair of crutches because he has osteoarthritis
    <br>and he needs a knee replacement, and has been booked for an operation.
    <br>He is here today so that the Lord Jesus Christ can use the anointed one to set him free.
    <br>He cannot walk. He cannot do anything on his own without this pair of crutches.
    <br>But see the man of God right there praying for him. He has removed the crutches.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>See him walking.
    <br>Thank You, Lord! I can walk.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I can walk.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>INSTANT HEALING: He Started RUNNING After Prayer!!!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Kofi Smiles.
    <br>I am from Accra, Ghana.
    <br>In 2009 I suddenly got sick.
    <br>I couldn't walk.
    <br>I couldn't do anything on my own.
    <br>I went to the Korle-Bu Hospital.
    <br>I had the best surgeon who attended to me,
    <br>yet I still couldn't walk.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was diagnosed with advanced rheumatoid arthritis.
    <br>The doctor operated on me once
    <br>and he injected some chemicals into my knee, hoping that I would be able to walk.
    <br>But thereafter, I still couldn't walk.
    <br>The problem affected my life tremendously.
    <br>I couldn't go to work.
    <br>I couldn't go out.
    <br>I was inbound bound,
    <br>and I could only get assistance through my wife.
    <br>I couldn't do anything on my own.
    <br>I used a wheelchair and crutches.
    <br>Initially I couldn't even go to the restroom on my own unless my wife took me,
    <br>until we bought a wheelchair and crutches.
    <br>I went to several medical institutions,
    <br>but the final one was The Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital
    <br>where I had a good doctor that attended to me.
    <br>I was in the hospital for a period of about nine months in admission
    <br>while they were trying to resolve the problem,
    <br>but still I couldn't get healed.
    <br>To be honest with you, I didn't know about Prophet TB Joshua,
    <br>but it was my wife who recommended that I can get healed
    <br>and that the only place I can get healed is to come to Lagos and meet Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>I didn't believe that I could get a solution here, so initially I refused.
    <br>But then she managed to get us an Emmanuel TV decoder,
    <br>and I started watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>and the miracles that were happening here,
    <br>and my faith started growing.
    <br>My faith started growing because of some of the miracles that I saw here.
    <br>Initially, I thought it was fake,
    <br>I didn't believe it
    <br>and then as I kept on every day, every Sunday watching what was happening here,
    <br>I started believing what was happening here.
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me,
    <br>immediately I felt an electric sensation in my body.
    <br>I felt very light.
    <br>I could see from the clip, my first reaction was to run
    <br>to see if I could really get back to my normal life.
    <br>They sent evangelists to come and grab me.
    <br>Immediately after the healing,
    <br>when I went back to Accra
    <br>most of my friends that had seen me with my problems stated that this healing will not last;
    <br>this is a temporary healing and I will relapse very soon.
    <br>But as you can see, it is almost five years now and I am still walking.
    <br>I have gone back to work.
    <br>I have gone back to my normal activity.
    <br>I don't require any assistance whatsoever,
    <br>and I am back to normal.
    <br>Now healed and crutch-free, Mr Smiles boldly strides in front of the congregation
    <br>in appreciation for the healing Jesus Christ performed in his life,
    <br>restoring him back to the original position God created him to be.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>My advice to people around the world is that the Word of God is very powerful
    <br>and most people sometimes have doubts about places like The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations,
    <br>but I believe that if you have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, any problem that you have can be resolved.
    <br>I advise that the man of God is truly a man of God. Nobody should doubt that.
    <br>Amen.
