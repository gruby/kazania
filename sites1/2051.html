    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I want to salute you for your patience.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Now is God's time for us to receive.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Those who are under the influence of our voice,
    <br>we salute your faith.
    <br>Today we shall quickly look at a very close relationship
    <br>between the way we manage our possessions,
    <br>the manner we manage our money,
    <br>and our salvation.
    <br>That will lead us to the book of Luke 16.
    <br>Luke 16:1 (NIV) - "Jesus told His disciples,
    <br>'There was a rich man whose manager
    <br>was accused of wasting his possessions.
    <br>Verse 2 - So he called him in and asked him,
    <br>'What is this I hear about you?
    <br>Give an account of your management,
    <br>because you cannot be manager any longer'.
    <br>Verse 3 - The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now?"'. That is the question.
    <br>I will take you to verse 10.
    <br>At your leisure time, read the chapters.
    <br>Verse 10 - "Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much,
    <br>and whoever who is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.
    <br>So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?".
    <br>Like I have said, take your time to read.
    <br>The relationship
    <br>between the way and manner we manage our possessions
    <br>and our salvation.
    <br>Many of us believe
    <br>that we can only give out of abundance.
    <br>This is a false belief.
    <br>In that book of Mark 12,
    <br>ask the poor widow,
    <br>and she will tell you
    <br>that everyone has something to give.
    <br>Someone is always there in need of us,
    <br>no matter how little.
    <br>Someone is always there in need of us, in need of you, no matter how little you have.
    <br>If you say you are poor,
    <br>you will be surprised to see someone who is poorer than you are.
    <br>In life,
    <br>there are always greater and lesser persons
    <br>than we are -
    <br>greater,
    <br>lesser
    <br>than we are.
    <br>When you take a look at that book of Mark 12,
    <br>you will see
    <br>how much our Lord Jesus notices and cares
    <br>about people's business, people's possessions, people's money.
    <br>It is not what you give that is important,
    <br>but the manner and the way you give.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>The way and manner you give attracts His attention.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Take note:
    <br>When you give to someone in a way that pleases God,
    <br>someone is waiting to give to you too.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>How do we give to please God?
    <br>In that verse,
    <br>Jesus cares so much about little.
    <br>He cares so much about little - little things.
    <br>He is concerned with how we manage our little possessions.
    <br>He is so much concerned with how we manage our little possessions.
    <br>God is constantly putting us to the test in the small things.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Take for instance,
    <br>if we know we need God to look,
    <br>to walk,
    <br>to sit,
    <br>to stand,
    <br>we will not have certain occasions for prayer.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>A break in prayer will mean a break in faith.
    <br>A break in faith will mean a break with God!
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>If you know how much we need God in little things,
    <br>we will know how much we need Him in big things.
    <br>If you know how much you need God to look,
    <br>you will know how much you need Him when you are going through affliction.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Jesus said if we are faithful in little things,
    <br>we will be faithful in big things.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>This principle dismisses all our 'if onlys'.
    <br>"If only I had much money, I would help the poor".
    <br>"If only I had much money, I would build an orphanage home".
    <br>The danger here is that if we fail to bless people with the little,
    <br>if you fail to part with the little that God blesses us with,
    <br>more may never come.
    <br>If you fail to part with little,
    <br>which God has given you as a blessing,
    <br>more may never come.
    <br>If you cannot part with little,
    <br>you will not be able to part with much.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>When you look at Luke 3
    <br>and take your reading from verse 7 to 14,
    <br>the crowd asked John the Baptist,
    <br>"What should we do?".
    <br>John the Baptist replied,
    <br>"If you have two shirts, give one to the poor.
    <br>If you have food, share with those who are hungry".
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>"Don't take more of what is not due to you.
    <br>Be content with what you have."
    <br>The way we manage little possessions,
    <br>the way we manage our little money,
    <br>will make God decide whether to promote you or not.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>When you look at the book of Luke 19:9
    <br>and the book of Mark,
    <br>you will see a close relationship
    <br>between the way and manner we manage our possessions
    <br>and our salvation.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Ask Zacchaeus
    <br>and he will tell you
    <br>it was when he decided to give willingly and genuinely to the poor
    <br>that Jesus commended him
    <br>and said,
    <br>"Salvation has come to your household".
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Your help to the poor,
    <br>to the refugees,
    <br>to the widows,
    <br>to the less privileged -
    <br>see it as an assignment from God.
    <br>Your help to the poor,
    <br>your help to the less privileged,
    <br>your help to the refugees -
    <br>see them as an assignment from God.
    <br>God bless you!
