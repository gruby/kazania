  <p>    
    <br>There's a woman among my visitors.
    <br>She is a young sister. I can see a mark on her body.
    <br>Come here.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>- You need deliverance. 
    <br>- Yes, I do.
    <br>You belong to some society, club, meeting... I mean, I don't know.
    <br>You belong to some body.
    <br>They are not Christians - they are satanic.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And through this, you find yourself doing prostitution,
    <br>you find yourself fornicating, you find yourself doing every evil thing.
    <br>That's true.
    <br>The Lord will deliver you.
    <br>This is not Christian, but a satanic kingdom.
    <br>And you are thinking of how to get out of that satanic kingdom.
    <br>- You don't want to go there again. 
    <br>- No. I don't want to.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>I don't know how to describe the place.
    <br>I only know that that place is not of God.
    <br>It's contrary to what we are doing here.
    <br>Please, deliver me! 
    <br>Please!
    <br>Jesus, come and help me! 
    <br>I can't anymore.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophet T. B. Joshua Ministering Prayer and Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Go out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophet T. B. Joshua Ministering Prayer and Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come out!
    <br>She wants to react.
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>She belongs to a satanic kingdom.
    <br>She wants to fight back.
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That is the woman the man of God  prophesied a while ago that...
    <br>She wants to fight back.
    <br>You see; she's setting a trap for me.
    <br>That is a trap.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Prophet T. B. Joshua Ministering Prayer and Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Satan has fallen 
    <br>Jesus has conquered
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Come on, come here!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The power has gone!
    <br>Prophet T. B. Joshua Ministering Prayer and Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>She wanted to attack me and if I'm not of God, she would overcome!
    <br>But greater is He...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday service
    <br>Can you see?  
    <br>She's regretting.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday service
    <br>Come on!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As we gather may Your Spirit work within us
    <br>As we gather may we glorify Your name
    <br>Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship
    <br> We'll be blessed because we came
    <br>This is a great testimony for you, that if this lady can be delivered, your problem is over.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am a dragon.
    <br>I was here to destroy.
    <br>They sent me to destroy marriages, households, youth destructions.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I was also a prostitute.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look at the screen of your television.
    <br>Deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She's still got some elements in her.
    <br>They don't give up easily.
    <br>It's like she challenges: "What do you want to do?"
    <br>I say: "Me?"
    <br>Finally, stand up!
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Look at the screen.
    <br>It is the lightning of God that is going through me.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am sent to destroy.
    <br>Look here.
    <br>I can't any more!
    <br>You canÂ´t attack any more?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Are you ready now to surrender?
    <br>Yes! 
    <br>Help me!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ! 
    <br>Be free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank You Lord, in Jesus Name!
    <br>You are free, in Jesus name!
    <br>Thank you, she is free.
    <br>If I'm not of God, I would be finished today.
    <br>She is mighty in the darkness.
    <br>She sent attack four times.
    <br>When I was talking here, she was just looking at me, to disfocus me.
    <br>If I cannot deliver her, she would deliver me.
    <br>Tell you neighbour, "If you cannot deliver them, you will be delivered."
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus?
    <br>- How are you?
    <br>- Fine, and you?
    <br>If there is anyone that is very very close to the man of God today, it's her.
    <br>She's my closest friend now.
    <br>Thank you. We thank God for your life.
    <br>She is a big fish.
    <br>You know, when you deliver a big fish to the kingdom of God, Jesus will promote you!
    <br>I am Marietjie van Niekerk, from South Africa.
    <br>I just want to give you my testimony.
    <br>I was possessed with demons.
    <br>I was a dragon.
    <br>The prophet just came and prayed for me and something started urging inside of me
    <br>and I felt the power of God moving.
    <br>At a stage, I tried to attack the prophet but the power of God was just awesome.
    <br>I'm delivered and I want to praise the Lord for that.
    <br>Something came out of me.
    <br>Thank You, Lord Jesus.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Can you tell us about your experience?
    <br>All I can say it was awesome and God is really here.
    <br>The man of God gave a prophetic message and then prayed for you.
    <br>What happened during that prayer?
    <br>There was a dragon demon inside of me that tried to attack the man of God.
    <br>So you are saying there was an evil spirit inside of you
    <br>that was trying to attack the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Yes, that's true.
    <br>And how did this spirit manifest itself?
    <br>It was like a cat that was trying to attack the man of God.
    <br>So the man of God was stretching forth his hand to pray for you, to deliver you, in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>and you said that the spirit inside of you was behaving like a cat?
    <br>What was it that you were experiencing, what were the actions
    <br>that this spirit was causing you to make?
    <br>It was an action of anger; I was just really aggressive.
    <br>That's probably what I can say; it was very aggressive.
    <br>I just wanted to attack.
    <br>Were you actually able to touch the prophet in any way?
    <br>Yes, I did once.
    <br>My shoulder was touching his shoulder and there was this beautiful power -
    <br>I couldn't stand it.
    <br>It forced me to the ground.
    <br>So you say that when your shoulder touched the man of God,
    <br>you were pushed to the ground by the power of the Holy Spirit?
    <br>Yes, that's true.
    <br>Were you actually able to attack the prophet physically in any way?
    <br>No.
    <br>Why was that?
    <br>The power of God. I think it was the Holy Spirit that is in him.
    <br>So the Holy Spirit prevented you from attacking Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And after the power of the Holy Spirit had put you on the floor, what happened next?
    <br>I didn't have any powers and I was just lying there.
    <br>I couldn't even stand up; I was just tired.
    <br>I wanted to go to sleep. I knew I didn't want to stand up.
    <br>I was just lying there; I couldn't stand up.
    <br>So after the man of God prayed for you and delivered you, what happened next?
    <br>How were you feeling immediately after the prayer?
    <br>There was a mountain on top of me before the prayer
    <br>and immediately after the prayer, it was gone - I was genuinely feeling free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>So after the prayer, you had changed from an aggressive attack position to a position of freedom?
    <br>Yes, definitely!
    <br>Can you tell us a little more about how this evil spirit was controlling you in the past,
    <br>what it forced you to do, what it caused you to think, and how it caused you to behave?
    <br>I had two persons inside of me.
    <br>I would have a normal life, and when the demons wanted to take over, I was out of control.
    <br>I didn't have a clue what was happening, or what they were doing with my body.
    <br>And what were some of those things that you were doing?
    <br>I was involved in youth ministry in churches to break them up.
    <br>How are you feeling now and how is your mind frame now?
    <br>What are you thinking and how are you feeling?
    <br>I'm feeling really good and I believe that I'm going back home to go into a ministry
    <br>for people that can come out from where I was.
    <br>You have also received several teachings from Prophet T.B. Joshua while you were here.
    <br>How are these teachings going to help you live that full and abundant life that God has provided for you?
    <br>It will really help me because I didn't have someone in the past
    <br>to show me where to go and what to do.
    <br>I can really rely on the teaching Prophet T.B. Joshua gave me.
    <br>There is no greater God and power than the Almighty God.
    <br>Amen. Thank you. We pray that God will give you the grace to maintain the blessing,
    <br>the freedom, and the deliverance that you have received here,
    <br>through the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And we pray that you will have a safe journey home, in Jesus name.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>- God bless you.
