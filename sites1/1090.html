    <br>"Come unto Me all ye that labour."
    <br>Here are Your children; they have come to You, Lord.
    <br>Every affliction in their blood, disease in their blood -
    <br>wherever it is located, I release them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You disease - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command them out!
    <br>Wherever it is - in your faculties - distance is not a barrier.
    <br>I say to that affliction, "Leave my people!"
    <br>I say to that disease, "Leave my people!"
    <br>I say to that sickness, "Leave my people!"
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to walk out of disease.
    <br>I feel the touch of Jesus.
    <br>Walk out of disease!
    <br>I can see you being delivered.
    <br>I can see you being healed.
    <br>I can see you being delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers all over the world, if it is true for your life that you are healed and delivered,
    <br>begin to confess your deliverance, confess your healing.
    <br>If it is true for you, you are healed!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>If the Word of God is true for your life, say, "I am healed; I am delivered!"
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Thank You, Jesus!]
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Mean it!
