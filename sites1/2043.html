    <br>The emblem of the Republic of Colombia National Police and its motto, 'God and Fatherland', displays above the entrance of the Command Centre
    <br>of the Cali Metropolitan Police Special Services, an agency of the Ministry of Defence, boasting some 7,633 officers,
    <br>the hard work and diligence of whom have seen local crime rates plummet to record lows in recent years.
    <br>After completing his epic two-day crusade and pastors' conference in the nation Colombia,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was invited by the Government of Colombia to meet with the Cali Metropolitan Police Force.
    <br>The police have come in numbers from all over the city to attend this special private event.
    <br>Arriving on motorbikes and in Patrol Jeeps, the Police Force musters in an atmosphere of excitement.
    <br>The Force's national colours adorn the stage, as police officers of all ranks within the city were in attendance,
    <br>keen to hear what God had to say to them through the man they had seen God use to bless their city and their nation.
    <br>Inside the Command Centre auditorium, Prophet T.B. Joshua's team gave a complimentary gift set to each of the police officers present,
    <br>comprising some of the books and DVDs of the prophet, translated in Spanish, to fortify their spiritual lives as they serve their God and their country.
    <br>With happy smiles, the gifts are gladly received and passed around to each person until everyone had their own set.
    <br>Many immediately began going through some of the items and some of the books with great interest.

    <br>Pulling up outside the Metropolitan Police Command Centre, Prophet T.B. Joshua arrives, welcomed by the Colonel of the city and a few of his top officers.
    <br>The man of God and his entourage are escorted onto the premises and climb the stairs.
    <br>He throws a salute and a cheerful smile as he is welcomed by a line of officers into the arena.
    <br>He makes his way to the auditorium, humbly greeting the police assembly as he goes.
    <br>The man of God is seated and the event begins with an address by Colonel Wilson Vergara of the Cali Metropolitan Police Special Services.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>Good evening. On behalf of the national police in Colombia and the city of Santiago de Cali, it is an honour that you are visiting our country.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>He has chosen to come to Colombia among all the Latin American countries to bring us blessings.
    <br>Right now, I would like to call on one of the police officers to present a small biography about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is a small biography about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He was born on 12 June, 1963, in the small town of Arigidi,
    <br>Akoko, in the State of Ondo, Nigeria.
    <br>The pregnancy of his mother was not ordinary because it lasted for 15 months.
    <br>Almost one hundred years before the birth, people had spoken about a young man who would come from the poor neighbourhood of Oosin
    <br>and God would use him powerfully.
    <br>Another event took place three days after his birth.
    <br>A great stone flew across his chest as it crashed into the house
    <br>narrowly missing the baby and landing a few centimetres away.
    <br>The incident made his mother call him, "Temitope",
    <br>meaning, "What God has done for me is worthy of thanks".
    <br>During his days at St. Stephen's Anglican Primary School in Arigidi,
    <br>he was a leader of the Student Christian Fellowship.
    <br>He was the smallest in the class but he led all the prayers in school.
    <br>He was known as "Small Pastor".
    <br>He couldn't finish his secondary school studies because of poverty.
    <br>Now, talking about his childhood, he said:
    <br>"I found myself in a family environment that irritated me.
    <br>I was born into poverty.
    <br>Poverty greatly affected us.
    <br>The education we received wasn't enough.
    <br>What I have was the result of my own self-effort.
    <br>I know so many people with similar circumstances who did otherwise.
    <br>They quit their situations, and their dreams crashed on the rocks of disappointment."
    <br>When he was very young, he knew how much he needed God.
    <br>For that reason, he did not allow his environment to affect his relationship with God.
    <br>That is basically who Prophet T.B. Joshua is.

    <br>Please, could you join me here on the platform for a moment?
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>For the benefit of those who did not know, on Friday and Saturday,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua held a crusade in which many people were healed and he prayed for a lot of people.
    <br>He came from Nigeria in Africa to pray for this country.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>On behalf of the National Police of Colombia, I would like to present you with this award in appreciation of what you have done for this city.

    <br>Next, I will give you the microphone.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>Thank you. God bless you.
    <br>We similarly do the same job in the natural.
    <br>I mean, the nature of our jobs in the natural is the same.
    <br>In the natural, the same, but in the spirit, quite different.
    <br>You prevent crime in the society in the natural.
    <br>We prevent crime in the spirit.
    <br>We are doing the same job.
    <br>I salute you; thank you.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>In humanity, we cannot realise human rights without social order
    <br>and social order is dependent on effective policing.
    <br>So, you can see we are doing the same job.
    <br>Effective policing and men of God are the same.
    <br>That is, effective policing, those who do the job from their heart,
    <br>we are doing the same job.
    <br>That is fundamental human rights and the police force.
    <br>As we know, the police force is an establishment found in every nation all over the world.
    <br>Their duty is to maintain order and assure obedience.
    <br>We are doing the same job.
    <br>Human rights on one hand are basic to humanity.
    <br>As a minister of God, I want to send my greetings to widows and widowers,
    <br>those who have been shot during service and those widows whose husbands died during service.
    <br>We call it social welfare.
    <br>I am standing on their behalf and I want to donate this award to them.
    <br>I personally have visited many countries and I cannot leave this country without visiting social welfare.
    <br>On behalf of the widows, widowers, those who have been wounded during service as police and those who died during service,
    <br>I am receiving this award on their behalf and I am going to donate $100,000 US Dollars for social welfare.

    <br>My commitment is to partner with the police in Cali, Colombia by praying with them and praying for them all day
    <br>and making sure that the story remains, when I leave, that the crime rate is zero.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>At the same time, praying for people that have been protecting this nation
    <br>and to pray for those police that have been protecting this country, that God should protect them and their families.
    <br>Once again, I salute the widows, widowers, those who have been shot during service as police,
    <br>those who are on the sickbed and those who died during service to their country.
    <br>Once again, I am donating $100,000 USD to their account for social welfare.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>With a wave of encouragement and a loving smile of solidarity, the man of God is escorted by Colonel Vergara as he leaves the arena
    <br>and walks through the Command Centre to the waiting vehicle.
    <br>Thanking the man of God for his time, the police mount an escort of bikes and patrol vehicles to swiftly see the man of God on his way through the city.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Leaves The Cali Metropolitan Police Command Centre
    <br>Moments later, the meeting of the Metropolitan Police Force closes and the officers file out onto the streets.
    <br>The joyful atmosphere the meeting has produced shows clearly on the faces and expressions of the officers
    <br>as they begin their journey back to their stations and back to their residences,
    <br>with several still holding on to the gift bags of spiritual items they had received from the man of God.
    <br>Their spirits have been uplifted, their faith activated and their determination strengthened to give their heart in the service of God and their nation, Colombia.
    <br>The sirens flashed, the motorbikes made their deep-throated calls, as the officers began to disperse, touched by the prophet's address,
    <br>his donation of of $100,000 US Dollars to the social welfare foundation for those orphaned and widowed in the course of duty,
    <br>and the pledge of his effectual and fervent prayer for themselves, their families, their city and their nation.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>Let's listen to the experiences.
    <br>Right now, we would like to speak to some of the police who were inside the event and listened to the prophet's address.
    <br>Sir, you are welcome; can you tell us your name and where you are from?
    <br>I am Officer Sergio Rámirez from Cali, Colombia.
    <br>I thank God and I thank him because this donation will help many people, especially police officers who were wounded in combat in the civil war.
    <br>So, we appreciate this a lot. Thank you.

    <br>We can see something in your hand. Can you show us what it is?
    <br>These are the books and DVDs Prophet T.B. Joshua gave all of us.
    <br>They were freely given to us.
    <br>There are also books about prophecies that he has given; I will go and read them.

    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua In Cali, Colombia
    <br>Here we are in the Metropolitan Police Headquarters in Santiago de Cali, Colombia, and with me here is the Commander in Chief of the Police of Cali.
    <br>We have just come back from a meeting with Prophet T.B. Joshua where he addressed the police of Cali, Colombia
    <br>and gave them a donation of $100,000 US Dollars for the social work of the police force,
    <br>caring for the widows of policemen, policemen that have been injured in service for their country and also those who have special needs and difficulties.
    <br>Right now, we would like to speak to the Commander in Chief of the Police here in Cali about the prophet's visit to their nation.
    <br>Thank you very much. I am Colonel Wilson Vergara Cetina, Commandant of the Metropolitan Police of Santiago de Cali.
    <br>I would like to appreciate the prophet's visit to Colombia.
    <br>Colonel Wilson Vergara
    <br>Cali Metropolitan Police Commandant
    <br>Many Christian men and women have been praying for a miracle in Santiago de Cali.
    <br>Today, the Colombia National Police in Santiago de Cali had the opportunity to receive Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and he gave a donation of $100,000 USD to the Colombia National Police for the social welfare of widows, widowers,
    <br>orphans and the men and women of the National Police Force of Colombia.

    <br>Colonel Wilson Vergara
    <br>Cali Metropolitan Police Commandant
    <br>Can you tell us, what do you believe the impact of this donation will be, and also the visit of the prophet, in the police force in Colombia?
    <br>We have been praying and crying to the Lord that the rate of violence in Santiago de Cali, especially the murder rate, reduces to zero.
    <br>We believe that God has heard our prayers and because of that, Prophet T.B. Joshua has come to Colombia to help us in prayer
    <br>so that we can fulfil the goal of winning Santiago de Cali for Christ and reduce the violence rate.
    <br>Colonel Wilson Vergara
    <br>Cali Metropolitan Police Commandant

    <br>Thank you very much for sharing your comments with us.
    <br>What can you say about the crusade that took place in the city, and also the pastors' conference and the humanitarian event,
    <br>that Prophet T.B. Joshua held in this city?
    <br>First of all, I want to give thanks, honour and glory to God.
    <br>We appreciate Prophet T.B. Joshua for coming to Colombia because in the days that he has been here, we have seen miracles,
    <br>cures and healings of many people.
    <br>We also saw the deliverance of several pastors here in Santiago de Cali.
    <br>For this, we give thanks to God and to Prophet T.B. Joshua for visiting Colombia.
    <br>Colonel Wilson Vergara
    <br>Cali Metropolitan Police Commandant
    <br>Finally, what message do you have for the police force who are under you, after receiving this visit from the prophet and receiving this donation?
    <br>Colonel Wilson Vergara
    <br>Cali Metropolitan Police Commandant
    <br>My message for the police force of Colombia is that the only way that the rate of delinquency can reduce is with God.
    <br>You have to seek God.
    <br>God does marvellous things like bringing Prophet T.B. Joshua to pray for our police and those who are orphaned or widowed.

    <br>I am Lieutenant Colonel Carlos Arturo Gaitan Castañeda, an Operations Commandant of the Metropolitan Police of Cali.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua in Cali, Colombia - Experiences
    <br>It was something special today; we found out a bit about his biography.
    <br>Apart from his coming to Cali where we saw many healings, he also donated $100,000 USD to The Police Social Welfare Association.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua in Cali, Colombia - Experiences
    <br>This donation will really help the orphans, widows and children of police with special needs that require special treatment
    <br>and special schools for them to study.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua in Cali, Colombia - Experiences
    <br>It is special because we have something in common in that both the prophet and the police are working for peace and well-being.
    <br>The Bible says that our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against principalities, powers and forces in high places.
    <br>Therefore, we really need spiritual help to improve our security.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua in Cali, Colombia - Experiences
    <br>There are many things.
    <br>He taught us a very important thing, which is to give.
    <br>He gave us things but also greatly insisted on the importance of giving.
    <br>There is so much poverty, needy children, orphans, widows and people who need help not only with prayer but also economically.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua in Cali, Colombia - Experiences
    <br>We appreciate you for choosing to come to our city of Santiago de Cali,
    <br>for visiting us, praying for our people, ministering deliverance and healing.
    <br>It has been a great blessing and I would like to thank first of all the prophet and also his team.
    <br>The Police Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua in Cali, Colombia - Experiences
    <br>Thank you so much for your comments, and we truly believe that 'better is not good enough; the best is yet to come!'
    <br>We look forward to a mutual relationship in Christ Jesus to help the helpless, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Many thanks to all of you for your help, both physically and spiritually.
