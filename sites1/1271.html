  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let me just give you a message from the heart.
    <br>When you look at the whole thing,
    <br>Christianity has become just a surface - human wisdom.
    <br>Christianity seems to be human wisdom.
    <br>There is no difference any longer between Christianity and religion.
    <br>So even when you listen to the news or whatever comment,
    <br>they classify them as religion.
    <br>Christianity is not a religion.
    <br>Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.
    <br>He came to restore this relationship.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>It is all about the Word of God in our heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[It is all about the Word of God in our heart.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[It is all about the Word of God in our heart.]
    <br>Today, Christianity has turned to the Word of God in our mouth.
    <br>People believe that they should just confess, "I am a Christian". Simple.
    <br>Your neighbourhood knows you are coming to the church
    <br>and consequently that you are a Christian, a believer - are you such in heart?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask.
    <br>Because you carry a Bible, a Cross, bear Joshua, Timothy, Deborah - are you such in heart?
    <br>If you are such in heart, that is the work of faith the Bible is talking about.
    <br>"Amen!" Are you such in heart?
    <br>"In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>That is what Christianity is all about.
    <br>That is what Jesus is interested in.
    <br>That is what pleases Jesus.
    <br>You are in the church.
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>Are you telling me your spirit is inside the church?
    <br>Let us quickly look at the Book of Colossians Chapter 3:
    <br>"Living as those made alive in Christ.
    <br>Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is,
    <br>seated at the right hand of God.
    <br>Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."
    <br>Let me take you to verse 23.
    <br>"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart,
    <br>as working for the Lord, not for human masters,
    <br>since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward..."
    <br>Take your time to read that Colossians' Book,
    <br>1 Chronicles 28:9,
    <br>James 4:3,
    <br>and Luke 16:15 when you get home.
    <br>Here you are in the church.
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>Because Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Jesus looks at our motive behind our action but men look at the action.
    <br>You are sitting down, you are laughing - that is all what man can see
    <br>but Jesus looks at the motive behind your sitting.
    <br>I mean, Jesus looks at why you do what you do but men look at what you do.
    <br>T.B. Joshua.
    <br>But the motive behind it...
    <br>That is what Christianity is all about.
    <br>You believe God that it will rain - you go ahead and plant crops.
    <br>That is what Christianity is all about.
    <br>I believe it will rain and I go ahead and plant crops without waiting for the rain.
    <br>People see you as a Christian because you are called Joshua, Timothy, Deborah, Esther,
    <br>you go to church as a pastor, Christian, bishop, prophet
    <br>and you have sound knowledge of the Scripture;
    <br>but don't forget: A man may be a Christian but not such in heart.
    <br>A man may have sound knowledge of the Bible and not such in heart.
    <br>In 1 Chronicles 28:9, the Lord searches all hearts and understands all the intents of the thoughts.
    <br>If you are not such in heart, how do you speak to God; how will God speak to you?
    <br>Because the Bible says, the Word of God in our heart is our contact with God.
    <br>Let someone say, "The Word of God in our heart is our contact with God".
    <br>It is His contact with us too.
    <br>He wants to speak to me - the Word of God in my heart will contact.
    <br>I want to speak to Him - the Word of God in my heart.
    <br>How do you speak to God when you are not such in heart?
    <br>You have been dancing since morning. Are you such in heart?
    <br>Whatever your heart engages on influences your conduct and your character.
    <br>If your heart does not contact the Word of God, nothing can be achieved in God.
    <br>You can be seen as a Christian because you are often seen with a big Bible and big Cross
    <br>but God does not see you as such because of the motive behind your being a Christian.
    <br>The new year is about...
    <br>You cannot continue this way.
    <br>If you continue this way without God's Word in your heart -
    <br>people see you as a Christian whereas you cannot contact God
    <br>and God cannot contact you - what kind of Christian is this?
    <br>You cannot contact God and God cannot contact you.
    <br>The only means, the only grace to contact you is that Word in your heart
    <br>but where is that Word in your heart?
    <br>The next year is not going to be this year in attitude, character, challenges, trial, condition.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Man has the power to testify, witness about Christ".
    <br>A man can say, "Jesus is Lord! Jesus is the Redeemer!
    <br>Jesus is the Healer! Whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life".
    <br>Man has that power but the Holy Spirit testifies, witnesses.
    <br>Knowing facts about Jesus does not change our relationship with Him.
    <br>So, read your Bible with devotion.
    <br>Discover what God has to say to you each day.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Knowing facts about Jesus does not change our relationship with Him".
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Knowing facts about Jesus does not change our relationship with Him.]
    <br>So, read your Bible with devotion.
    <br>When you see someone who is doing good, very nice, don't be in a haste to see him as good
    <br>because you don't know his motive.
    <br>This is what they have been using to deceive you - you politicians - all over the world.
    <br>"Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it."
    <br>They give you food, they give you everything, they campaign...
    <br>But when they get to the position, they change.
    <br>"I will do this!" - you follow them, "Hey!"
    <br>You will build a school; you will do this; you will improve the school, the economy.
    <br>All over the world you see, "Hey!"
    <br>Food, bring money out to the city, share money, give everyone - and you follow.
    <br>By the time they get there, the story changes.
    <br>When you see someone who is doing good and is loving,
    <br>don't be in a haste because you don't know his motive.
    <br>When you see someone who is preaching the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>claiming to witness for Christ, let us take our time before calling him a pastor or Christian
    <br>because you don't know his motive.
    <br>Jesus' focus is the motive behind what we do - what you do and why you do it.
    <br>That is His focus.
    <br>His focus is the motive behind what we do and why we do it,
    <br>what you say and why you say it.
    <br>That is His focus.
    <br>Many of us have been deceived when it comes to relationships
    <br>because a man is very nice, a woman is nice, caring and loving -
    <br>"Oh, you have forgotten; this is a nice person."
    <br>But as time goes on, the story changes.
    <br>Man has the power to decide.
    <br>You can decide to just walk out of this place.
    <br>The Spirit of God will not grab you and say, "No, don't go!"
    <br>You can decide as we are talking, "No, no, what this man is saying, I can't stand it" and walk out
    <br>and the Spirit of God, Jesus, will not say, "No, come back"; He will leave you to go.
    <br>That is discretion given to everyone.
    <br>That is why Jesus asked the man at the pool of Bethesda,
    <br>"What will I do for you? What do you want me to do?"
    <br>He said, "No, I have been here for many years; no one to carry me to the pool".
    <br>"What do you want me to do now?"
    <br>If the man said, "No, no, don't talk to me; go your way!", Jesus would leave him.
    <br>That is discretion.
    <br>The man said, "Please, help me".
    <br>Man has the power to decide.
    <br>You can decide to pray which many of us have been doing,
    <br>just when you have a problem - "Jesus!"
    <br>You can decide to pray early morning; it is a normal routine.
    <br>You wake up early in the morning - "Oh, children, let us pray."
    <br>"In the name of Jesus" - you are the one praying; Jesus does not know.
    <br>Exercising the will through the mind but the Holy Spirit has the power of choice.
    <br>Jesus tests our heart to reward us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Jesus tests our heart to reward us.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus tests our heart to reward us.]
    <br>All this running helter skelter, "I'm a pastor, I'm a Christian, I'm this",
    <br>carrying this, all this appearance, all this shouting, "Hey!",
    <br>praying, fasting, "Hey, my God!", going to the mountain -
    <br>they say, "He is a prayer warrior; he is this, that".
    <br>Jesus tests our heart to reward us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The question remains - are you such in heart?
    <br>What is your motive?
    <br>Jesus tests our heart to give us according to our efforts.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Jesus tests our heart to give us according to our efforts.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus tests our heart to give us according to our efforts.]
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>Your heart must be at its best because the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the Father
    <br>expresses Himself through your heart.
    <br>The Spirit of God expresses Himself through your heart.
    <br>All this, "In the name of Jesus!" - are you such in heart?
    <br>"Amen!!"
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>"Let us pray!"
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>This is why it is always difficult to go through trials.
    <br>No one can go through trials without the Word in the heart.
    <br>No one can say, "Jesus is Lord!", without the Word in the heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[No one can say, "Jesus is Lord!", without the Word in the heart.]
    <br>So, where are we going?
    <br>And I'm very very sure - that is why I'm saying this -
    <br>a lot of percentage in our midst here are not such in heart.
    <br>That is why I'm bitter.
    <br>For you to go to the New Year - with the trials, tribulations, situations I am seeing that are coming -
    <br>you need the Word of God in your heart to contact Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I need the Word in my heart to contact Jesus".
    <br>It is the Word Jesus also uses to contact you - the Word in your heart.
    <br>What I'm looking at, I'm looking round -
    <br>if you are my neighbour, I will know;
    <br>if you share the same inheritance, I will know;
    <br>if you are my family, I will know.
    <br>I can see.
    <br>This is just celebration - percentage of us here.
    <br>For how long shall we continue this - trials, persecution, tribulation?
    <br>No one can say, "Jesus is Lord!" genuinely without the Word in the heart.
    <br>Genuinely.
    <br>Anybody can say, "Jesus is Lord!" - you don't need license for that - but genuinely...
    <br>Genuinely.
    <br>So, rise up and let us pray.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>The Holy Spirit is at the door of your heart.
    <br>Say, "My heart, awake!"
    <br>The Holy Spirit is at the door of my heart - awake!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is there knocking, saying, "Awake!"
    <br>That is, open the door.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is at the door of your heart right now!
    <br>I say to your heart, "Awake!"
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Committing the Word of God to memory is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Committing the Word of God to memory is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>Learning the history of the Book of the Bible is valuable.
    <br>You can be a lecturer, you can teach, you can get your daily bread,
    <br>getting money - it is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>Say, "In the name of Jesus!" - where is Jesus because the Word is not from your heart.
    <br>My heart, hear the voice of God.
    <br>My heart hear the voice of God
    <br>My heart hear the voice of Holy Spirit
    <br>Let there be freedom
    <br>Let there be rest
    <br>In my heart in my mind
    <br>And in my soul in Jesus' name
    <br>Let there be freedom
    <br>Let there be rest in my heart
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you pray, you do not receive; when you ask, you do not receive
    <br>because you pray and ask with wrong motives.
    <br>That is why you don't receive.
    <br>I'm not surprised.
    <br>Many of you just let...
    <br>It is a normal life - we have to pray in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening.
    <br>You just pray, not that...
    <br>You pray, you do not receive; you ask, you do not receive
    <br>because you ask with wrong motives.
    <br>'Wrong motive' could be - there is no Word in your heart
    <br>and the Word in our heart makes us Christians.
    <br>The Word of God in our heart makes us Christians.
    <br>The Word of God in our heart is our contact with Jesus.
    <br>It is His contact with us.
    <br>So, now you need this Word.
    <br>Now you are about to enter the new year.
    <br>By the time you leave here, you know the next thing to do.
    <br>It is not to go to the party; you are to work on your spiritual life.
    <br>You can see the reason now.
    <br>For someone to be saying he is a Christian, whereas Jesus Himself does not know.
    <br>It is not in the record that you are a Christian; you are a religious person.
    <br>Nothing makes us Christians but the Word in our heart.
    <br>The Word in our heart is our contact.
    <br>"Hello."
    <br>And the Lord will say, "Hi, what do you want?"
    <br>The Word in your heart.
    <br>That is why you must have freedom, a free heart - a heart without a grudge.
    <br>We have damaged our heart.
    <br>Nursing a grudge, nursing bad feelings towards others damages our heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Nursing a grudge, pain of the past, bitterness, envy, jealousy, bad feelings towards others,
    <br>damages our heart.
    <br>The same heart is the contact point.
    <br>The Bible says the Spirit of the Father expresses Himself through our heart
    <br>and the heart we are talking about is damaged.
    <br>You have to begin to repair your heart.
    <br>The Spirit of the Father expresses Himself through our heart and the same heart is damaged.
    <br>Nursing a pain of the past, grudge, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>You say, "No, I will not agree."
    <br>Nursing an unforgiving spirit damages the heart.
    <br>So, you can see now.
    <br>So, you have to work now; you have a lot of work to do
    <br>because I do not want you to enter a new year with all this.
    <br>And you continue to say, it is witches and wizards;
    <br>your partner is the one attacking you.
    <br>Nobody attacked you; you are the one that damaged your heart.
    <br>There is no landing for God; there is no point for God to talk to you.
    <br>There must be a point.
    <br>"Hello."
    <br>Through what? - Heart.
    <br>The Word in the heart is our contact with God.
    <br>It is His contact with us but the heart is damaged.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Forgive them!"
    <br>I'm not saying, "Forgive him"; I said, "Forgive them!"
    <br>Say, "Forgive them and move forward!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, let us pray for our nation, your country, your continent.
    <br>Your flag, any contact you have - raise it up!
    <br>Ask God to redeem your nation and leaders, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Open your lips - ask God to redeem your country, nation, leaders,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Right now, commit your journey of righteousness -
    <br>ask God to continue to strengthen you.
    <br>Because when you leave here, you continue the journey of righteousness.
    <br>With the message you have received today - journey of righteousness,
    <br>journey of uprigntness, journey of holiness.
    <br>Ask God to strengthen you.
    <br>Ask God to strengthen you in your journey of righteousness, uprightness, holiness,
    <br>faithfulness, obedience, humility and love.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Strengthen me, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Don't forget, Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Whatever you do, whatever you say must be such in heart.
    <br>I pray the Lord gives you an obedient heart, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank you.
