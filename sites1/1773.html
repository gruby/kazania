  <p>    
    <br>We have received thousands of emails from our viewers around the world
    <br>asking questions about this present situation and we would like to read a few of them to you.
    <br>Ok
    <br>We'll start with this email. It really expresses the mind of everyone.
    <br>It reads:
    <br>Dear Synagogue, I want to know why our Prophet supported the government
    <br>to ban gatherings in churches.
    <br>Where does T.B. Joshua want us to worship?
    <br>We are bonafide members of The SCOAN and we have nowhere to go.
    <br>Kind regards.
    <br>You have so many emails.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I am in line with God.
    <br>It was a vision I saw sometime last year - in April, February and even January of this year.
    <br>I think we have the record there. Actions speak louder.
    <br>I think they can play it and let us hear.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>Prophecy! Prophecy! Prophecy!
    <br>When God's servant speaks forth, the wise listen.
    <br>Deuteronomy 18:22.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On Sunday, 24th February 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message
    <br>about a vision God had given him concerning The SCOAN service.
    <br>These were his words:
    <br>The thing God is still telling me - you will just get here one day, you will learn that there is no church.
    <br>Please, meet me on Emmanuel TV. No church.
    <br>So you'll meet me on Emmanuel TV talking to you
    <br>or when there is a revival, you'll see me.
    <br>So we have to be serious.
    <br>On Sunday, 7th April 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied further
    <br>about the vision he had seen regarding the church service at The SCOAN.
    <br>This is what he said:
    <br>You know I told you people of recent: you may be here, you'll learn that there is no service -
    <br>close the church. You'll meet us on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Now we are in a perilous time - a very difficult time.
    <br>Hear what is happening all over the world.
    <br>Fearful year!
    <br>A lot happened, and our protection is God.
    <br>On Sunday, 5th January 2020, for the third time, Prophet TB Joshua once again prophesied
    <br>about what he saw would happen this year concerning The SCOAN service.
    <br>This is what he said.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm so concerned about what is going to happen this year -
    <br>so much concerned than anything.
    <br>If it is going to cause me to close the church and find out what is going to happen -
    <br>because everywhere is fear.
    <br>If something wants to catch you, it should not catch you unprepared.
    <br>You don't mind but I have been very, very concerned.
    <br>Viewers, you have seen the prophetic message since last year.
    <br>Where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>Since last year, I have been on my knees, praying to God to see us through
    <br>but the issue is unchangeable.
    <br>Discussion With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>At the Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>It's just like that.
    <br>I am walking by vision and a mission.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Discussion With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>At the Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>- Thank you for your time, sir.
    <br>- Thank you.
