    <br>THE DAY A WALKING CORPSE CAME TO CHURCH!!!
    <br>What a heart-wrenching sight.
    <br>Words cannot describe the deplorable state of this man's condition.
    <br>He does not need to talk, the expression on his face alone tells us how he must feel.
    <br>From the crown of his head to the sole of his feet
    <br>his body has been afflicted with poison causing even his lips
    <br>to literally peel from his mouth.
    <br>What hope there could be for a man in such a dreadful state?
    <br>Hope can only be found in Jesus Christ.
    <br>THE DAY A WALKING CORPSE CAME TO CHURCH!!!
    <br>We can see that his private area is in a terrible condition,
    <br>having been deformed by the scrotum cancer.
    <br>THE DAY A WALKING CORPSE CAME TO CHURCH!!!
    <br>He has come to The SCOAN believing that the resurrection power of Jesus Christ
    <br>will set him free.
    <br>THE DAY A WALKING CORPSE CAME TO CHURCH!!!
    <br>Francis is my name, I am forty years old.
    <br>We can see a man sitting next to you.
    <br>Please tell us who is he to you.
    <br>He is a relative of mine.
    <br>His name is David Oklu.
    <br>He is suffering from body poison, and penis and scrotum cancer.
    <br>We took him to many places but there was no solution.
    <br>A friend told me to bring him to The SCOAN.
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>He cannot eat.
    <br>He cannot sleep.
    <br>He cannot talk well.
    <br>I believe Jesus will do it.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Continue to watch the screen of TV and see how God Almighty
    <br>will have mercy on this man and rescue him through His anointed servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Continue to watch the screen of TV and see the Prophet of God ministering healing
    <br>into the life of this man, to set him totally free from the problem of body poison.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Sometime later, Mr David Oklu came back to The SCOAN to show the glory of God in his life.
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>The miracle Worker is still alive - His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>We can see how the man whose body was once stricken with poison
    <br>has been totally restored, after a simple prayer, in the powerful name of Jesus.
    <br>Who can deny so much evidence?
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>Let your faith be lifted, as your eyes behold the mighty wonders of God.
    <br>No matter how impossible your situation may seem, remember,
    <br>everything is possible for the one who believes. Mark 9:23.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is David Oklu.
    <br>I am from Ghana.
    <br>I am forty years old.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was body poison, penis and scrotum cancer.
    <br>When I was having this problem, I could not walk, eat, sleep or even wear clothes.
    <br>I had been to many hospitals; there was no solution
    <br>until a brother brought me here to The SCOAN.
    <br>That day, I was brought inside a car.
    <br>I could not even come out from the car.
    <br>My two brothers used to carry me up and down.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua came to me and stretched his hand towards me.
    <br>From there, I felt very cold in my body.
    <br>That was how I got my healing.
    <br>I thought I was going to die.
    <br>In fact, I had spent a lot.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua did not collect any money from me;
    <br>rather, he used to give me money any time I came to church.
    <br>I can show you the affected part.
    <br>To the glory of God, he came as a completely naked person
    <br>because the problem he brought was more that he could bare.
    <br>Right now, the brother is saying, to the glory of God,
    <br>he is going to show us, so that we can believe, the Thomases in our midst
    <br>that God Almighty has done it and there is nothing anyone can do about it.
    <br>Let us watch the screen of TV.
    <br>We saw the penis and the scrotum before - how terrible it was.
    <br>We saw it all with our very eyes on the clips in the TV.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?
    <br>While you were having this problem, were you able to touch your penis or your scrotum like that?
    <br>No, I could not touch it before.
    <br>Were you able to put on pants and clothes?
    <br>No.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Why you were not able to do this?
    <br>Due to pain.
    <br>Right now, God Almighty has set you free.
    <br>THE DAY A WALKING CORPSE CAME TO CHURCH!!!
