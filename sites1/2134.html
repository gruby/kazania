  <p>    
    <br>My name is George.
    <br>Just as I was entering the house, I announced, "The New Anointing Water is here."
    <br>I was told about a testimony.
    <br>My son and family are here.
    <br>What he saw, he is unable to explain. He is panicking and shivering.
    <br>He cried from the basement 'til he reached here.
    <br>The family was trying to comfort him; they didn't know what happened.
    <br>When I told them that the New Anointing Water was in the box,
    <br>they said that they understand what had happened.
    <br>He Goes To The Mailbox To Bring The New Anointing Water And Sticker
    <br>Lord Jesus, as I touch it, deliver us.
    <br>We thank You!
    <br>Right now, we are opening it to the glory of God.
    <br>This is the sticker from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>"Not mine but God's own, in Jesus' name."
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>This is from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Bring her. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>She has not even touched it.
    <br>She has not seen the New Anointing Water.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Receive The New Anointing Water And Sticker
    <br>Deliverance Through The New Anointing Water And Sticker In Jesus' Name
    <br>Precious, can you explain to us in detail what happened?
    <br>My mum told me to come and take fish from the basement.
    <br>I came down gently and went there to take the fish
    <br>because this is where most of our foodstuffs are kept.
    <br>As I turned, I saw something right here close to the prayer room.
    <br>I was crying.
    <br>He was wearing a white robe.
    <br>I could not see from this place up.
    <br>I could not see the legs because I was very scared,
    <br>so I rushed up and left my shoes down here.
    <br>My mum calmed me down and told me to sit down.
    <br>I really thank God for the experience.
