    <br>REACHING THOSE IN ISOLATION CENTRES FOR INTERACTIVE PRAYER
    <br>The blessing of Jesus is for those who knock and ask (Matthew 7:7).
    <br>We want to encourage our communities, states, local and international bodies,
    <br>medical doctors, scientists and the people in charge to organise those who are in isolation
    <br>and let us arrange how to connect them to us on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>In whatever way you support to make this happen, we are a team;
    <br>we are not doing more than you (1 Corinthians 3:8).
    <br>In any way you need our service in transmission, we are at your service.
    <br>Together we shall pray for them.
    <br>Together we shall be set free from this COVID-19.
    <br>The same anointing that heals one is also able to heal all at the same time.
    <br>Just as the Scripture says, at sunset, the people brought to Jesus
    <br>all who had various kinds of sickness and after the mass prayer,
    <br>they were all healed (Luke 4:40).
    <br>Please contact us at 
    <br>info@emmanuel.tv
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>God with us.
