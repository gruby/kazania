  <p>    
    <br>I was sent by Leah's father from Adamawa State.
    <br>This girl was abducted alongside other school girls at Dapchi since 2018.
    <br>Why is the father not here?
    <br>The father is not well; he is traumatised.
    <br>I am his elder brother.
    <br>We want you to pray for us; we have gone to many places to look for help but could not get it.
    <br>We heard about you, that is why we came for your assistance and help.
    <br>I am Yakubu Nkeki, Chairman Of Abducted Chibok Girls' Parents, from Borno State.
    <br>Please, sir, help us!
    <br>The pictures of the girls I'm holding with me - they are 112 Chibok girls that are yet to be released
    <br>in the hands of the captors.
    <br>We have gone to so many places seeking for solution but there was no answer.
    <br>We heard from many people that there is a Prophet, T.B. Joshua, in Lagos
    <br>that is delivering people all over the nation.
    <br>That is why we from Chibok, on behalf of the 112 parents,
    <br>whose daughters have not yet been released came to seek for solution.
    <br>Help us to pray so that the 112 girls in the hands of the captors might be released.
    <br>We believe God will intervene and bring them home safely.
    <br>Stand up and you have to promise:
    <br>This coming week - Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday -
    <br>you must promise, you have to be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>With all your heart, pray and fast -
    <br>Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday - everyone.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday,
    <br>be in attitude of prayer and fasting.
    <br>With all your heart, pray for these children.
    <br>Pray for the other children and Leah as well.
    <br>Your prayer - for release!
    <br>I'm carrying all of you and the viewers all over the world along.
    <br>I will lead you.
    <br>Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday.
    <br>After you have done that, I know...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Let me see your heart and your hand!
    <br>Viewers all over the world - join us Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday.

    <br>Have mercy on us!
    <br>We ask for Your mercy - mercy of release!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>This is commission.
    <br>The Lord has commissioned you for this job -

    <br>This is where you will know that God loves you just like any of His Apostles.
    <br>Thank you for your promise.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Sir, you are welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you please introduce yourself and those who are standing with you.
    <br>My name is Yakubu Nkeki.
    <br>I'm the Chairman of Abducted Chibok Girls' Parents
    <br>that were abducted April 14, 2014 in Chibok local government, Borno State.
    <br>Here standing at my right hand side are the parents of the Chibok girls
    <br>that have not yet been released - 112 girls.
    <br>These are some of the parents.
    <br>Some are still at home.
    <br>We came here because we have visited many different places,
    <br>looking for solution to rescue the remaining girls.
    <br>Initially, they were 276 girls abducted.
    <br>In the process of negotiation, the government were able to rescue 113 girls.
    <br>We know that the government has tried its best.
    <br>Soldiers have tried their best.
    <br>Many soldiers have lost their lives in the process of rescuing these poor girls
    <br>from the hands of their captors.
    <br>We the Chibok girls' parents, appreciate the effort of the government
    <br>but there still remain 112 girls.
    <br>Since 2016, we have not received any credible information about them.
    <br>We have been looking for solution;
    <br>I, personally, have been to different countries: Germany, South Africa and many others.
    <br>We heard that there is a prophet in Lagos called Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>who delivers people from the hands of captors, from prison and delivers people from demons.
    <br>And those who are even crippled, walk!
    <br>This is what made us come to represent the parents of the 112 girls from Chibok
    <br>and to pray over these poor girls.
    <br>We know, with the power and miracles we have been seeing, God will bring the solution
    <br>through Prophet T.B. Joshua and God will release them, definitely.
    <br>By Sunday April 14, 2019 these poor girls will be exactly five years in the hands of their captors.
    <br>We do not know the condition they are in now.
    <br>Due to the pain of losing these poor girls, 34 parents also died
    <br>as they refused to eat or drink.
    <br>They were traumatised.
    <br>We believe definitely that the problem of these poor girls will be over
    <br>since we are here in The SCOAN.
    <br>He even ordered the nations to join him in praying for the release of the remaining 112 Chibok girls.
    <br>We believe, definitely they will be released.
    <br>He said that people around the world should fast on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.
    <br>By this, we know that God will intervene.
    <br>My name is Yana Galang.
    <br>I come from Chibok in Borno State, Nigeria.
    <br>The picture of the girl in my hand now is of my own biological daughter,
    <br>by name Rifkatu Galang.
    <br>She is one of the Chibok girls that was abducted on the 14th April 2014 by terrorists.
    <br>She is still with them and I don't know where she is
    <br>and I don't know what her condition is -
    <br>maybe she eats or drinks, I don't know.
    <br>But I know and believe that as we have come here to The SCOAN,
    <br>we believe in God, that God will intervene in this issue,
    <br>that these our children will be released very soon by the grace of God.
    <br>We believe, the faith that has brought them, will see them through
    <br>and these children will come out and they will give a testimony, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent us to you
    <br>that you have come all the way long from Borno State in the Northern part of Nigeria
    <br>and the man of God knows all the expenses that you must have had
    <br>in order to come here today as a group
    <br>and also your accommodation, feeding - the man of God is so much concerned
    <br>and moved by the Spirit of God.
    <br>He said, we should give you the sum of 452,000 Naira.
    <br>This is the sum of 452,000 Naira for all of you
    <br>to cover your transport expenses, feeding, accommodation.
    <br>Also 'The Mirror' book for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Abducted Chibok Girls' Parents Receive 452,000
    <br>Naira From T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>Thank you very much. We appreciate it.
    <br>May God bless him in abundance.
    <br>We never expected that we would even get close to him
    <br>but he even opened up, shaked hands with us and listened to our problem.
    <br>Thank you very much. We appreciate it.
    <br>And it is just a beginning and it shows that really, our daughters will be back soon.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I'm Yunana Sharibu.
    <br>I'm the senior brother to Nathaniel Sharibu, the father of Leah.
    <br>The picture in our hand is a picture of Leah Sharibu and her mother.
    <br>Her father cannot be around because he is not well.
    <br>The same applies to the mother.
    <br>Being the senior brother in the family, I decided to represent the family here.
    <br>The man beside me is an uncle to the family.
    <br>He is an evangelist residing in Yola.
    <br>Leah Sharibu has been in captivity since the 19th of April, 2018.
    <br>There were about 119 school girls at Dapchi
    <br>and all of them were returned after some time, with the exception of Leah.
    <br>We have travelled to many places in search for a solution, to get this girl back.
    <br>But all failed.
    <br>So now we heard about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We came together with the parents of the Chibok abducted girls.
    <br>So Leah has been now one year and two months in captivity.
    <br>I will even start to say my testimony
    <br>because what I have seen today is more or less a testimony to me.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent us to present to the family
    <br>the total cash sum of 700,000 Naira.
    <br>That is the total sum of 700,000 Naira by the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV Partners, and this money is to support the parents.
    <br>Out of this money, the man of God has instructed
    <br>that 500,000 Naira cash should be given to the mother and father of Leah
    <br>because of the condition they are in now.
    <br>200,000 Naira for you to take care of your feeding, transportation and accommodation.
    <br>And also 'The Mirror' book for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>He has also sent spiritual items.
    <br>We are very grateful.
    <br>We want to extend our regards and gratitude to the man of God.
    <br>We are very grateful. Thank you very much.
