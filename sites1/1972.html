    1972
  </h3>
  <p>    
    <br>This is Nazareth, the historic hometown of Jesus Christ,
    <br>the Saviour, the Redeemer, the Miracle Worker.
    <br>Here is the amphitheatre of Mount Precipice,
    <br>where Jesus passed through the crowd in Luke 4:30-31,
    <br>after declaring in the Synagogue that the Scriptures had been fulfilled.
    <br>As the crowd looked for Him, all they could see were His footprints,
    <br>footprints that changed the world.
    <br>Over 2000 years later, on the very same mountain where Jesus walked,
    <br>the question beats in the hearts of the people:
    <br>Are the stories about Jesus of Nazareth history or reality?
    <br>Is the power of Jesus still alive or working?
    <br>Is He still healing today?
    <br>Is he still working wonders now?
    <br>Yes, He is.
    <br>T.B. Joshua has come to demonstrate to the people of the Holy Land
    <br>not the Christ of history but the Christ which the Holy Spirit reveals.
    <br>T.B. Joshua is here with the message of love and restoration,
    <br>a display of the Holy Spirit's power.
    <br>A supernatural touch of healing, deliverance and miracles.
    <br>Prepare to witness God's Word become a reality in the Holy Land,
    <br>as you join us at the Nazareth meeting with T.B. Joshua.
    <br>THE NAZARETH MEETING
    <br>WITH T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>With all the news surrounding your revival in Israel,
    <br>emails had been flooding in with dreams warning of attacks.
    <br>The major issue is that it has been 2000 years since the name of Jesus has been called in public.
    <br>"Don't you dare to call that Name in this revival."
    <br>So, which name will you call, now that you are going?
    <br>T.B. Joshua, let us hear from you.
    <br>Acts of Apostles 5:38-40.
    <br>It depends on who sent you.
    <br>Above all powers, above all kings, what can man do?
    <br>Can man stop God?
    <br>No!
    <br>Capital NO.
    <br>In June 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua held a historic meeting in Nazareth, Israel,
    <br>the hometown of Jesus Christ.
    <br>1000's travelled from around the world to receive from the anointing of Jesus of Nazareth.
    <br>However, before the event took place, there was noise throughout Israel
    <br>to the extent they said the event would be cancelled.
    <br>What the world saw, before they said the meeting would be cancelled...
    <br>With this act, this holy mountain is being defiled.
    <br>This city is a holy city and this mountain is a holy mountain which the Pope visited.
    <br>Our stand is very clear.
    <br>We met yesterday with other Christian leaders.
    <br>We raised awareness among our people and parish members
    <br>that they should not participate in this event that will be held on Mount Precipice.
    <br>Even out of curiosity, they should not go; if they do, they would be promoting a liar,
    <br>a person who doesn't like the benefits of the Christian faith.
    <br>This man is only promoting lies, and anyone who follows this liar is unjust.
    <br>That is why we ban our people from indulging in this event.
    <br>Leaders of the Islamic Movement are also rejecting
    <br>the visit of the one who claims to be a prophet - Joshua.
    <br>We now go to talk to the head of the Islamic Movement in Nazareth.
    <br>Brother Osama Taha, good evening.
    <br>Good evening to all viewers.
    <br>There is still a lot of noise around this visit.
    <br>This visit that is going to be held by this antichirst and wizard,
    <br>we, the Islamic Movement, completely reject it.
    <br>The Islamic Movement is having many meetings with top officials to stop this meeting.
    <br>Omar Al Gasob
    <br>The Naseraty Party Member
    <br>We should not give this place, which is considered to be highly holy, to a wizard.
    <br>We should not allow him to use our land to advertise himself.
    <br>I am against this visit; this person is provoking people of all religions in Nazareth.
    <br>They should ban him and not give him any opportunity at all!
    <br>If this man's coming to our city will benefit us - then why not?
    <br>Why worry?
    <br>If he is an atheist, God will judge him.
    <br>If his coming will benefit the city - why shouldn't he come?
    <br>Who is this man, T.B. Joshua that everybody is talking about?
    <br>We are talking about a religious Christian man, an evangelist from Nigeria.
    <br>"The self-proclaimed 'Prophet' TB Joshua is going to perform his rituals in Nazareth."
    <br>Nazareth is waiting for the man who claims to be a prophet from Nigeria.
    <br>They call him T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The Bible and Jesus warned us there would be false prophets coming.
    <br>And they would perform great miracles so that even the chosen ones would be misled.
    <br>The essence of the danger of this man is his political ideology.
    <br>We do not know where he is coming from or the purpose behind everything he does.
    <br>He is very wealthy and can entice people to follow him.
    <br>He does so to fulfil the agenda of those who sent him.
    <br>"Boycotting the sorcerer zionist is a national and religious duty."
    <br>This is an attempt to empty the traditional conservative churches of the believers" -
    <br>stated members of the Executive Committed of the Orthodox Forum,
    <br>in an article published by arab48.com.
    <br>During an interview with Panet News, Father Nectorios Farah
    <br>spoke about the upcoming event with T.B. Joshua in Nazareth and said,
    <br>"Our traditional church has been the same for 2000 years,
    <br>we have never seen such ridiculous hallucinations happening in Christian churches."
    <br>"We refuse the visit of Joshua the wizard" - states the Islamic Movement,
    <br>in this article published by Panet News, where they declare their rejection of the proposed meeting
    <br>in Nazareth, as it was expected to cause religious uproar.
    <br>In a statement to Panet News, representatives of the Christian Church and Pastoral Council
    <br>told the people of Nazareth, "Do not come to this event, not even out of curiosity!"
    <br>Shashe.net news published and article written by Bassam Manasra headlined,
    <br>"Joshua's coming is a crime" and further stated, "There are no more prophets."
    <br>Before the event, Mount Precipice was set ablaze in order stop the event from occurring.
    <br>Let us watch the fire.
    <br>Look, fire!
    <br>They have set the mountain on fire!
    <br>Fire in burning on Mount Precipice, the site of T.B. Joshua's event.
    <br>MOUNT PRECIPICE ON FIRE
    <br>A protest also took place.
    <br>They are saying, "Listen to us! Let this witch get away from us!
    <br>Mount Precipice will never be humiliated by you, coward!"
    <br>PERSECUTION is PROMOTION!!! | Documentary Of TB Joshua In Nazareth ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±ðŸ”¥
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You are welcome to Nazareth.
    <br>The dawn of Christianity!
    <br>Love for fellow man breaks down all barriers.
    <br>It melts all hindrances.
    <br>It dissolves prejudice, misunderstanding and suspicion.
    <br>GOD MOVED MIGHTILY!!!
    <br>"The love you give away is the only love you keep." T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The noise continued even as the event was being held.
    <br>As T.B. Joshua preached, religious groups opposite the meeting broadcast this message:
    <br>They are saying, "Do not participate with this wizard."
    <br>"This is a witch in our decent land."
    <br>Event after the event a group of religious people performed a 'ritual' at Mount Precipice,
    <br>claiming they were cleansing the Biblical site.
    <br>We would like to say a prayer to cleanse this place.
    <br>Also for the people of Nazareth and the holy land.
    <br>We start with a prayer to sanctify this salt, water and leaves.
    <br>PERSECUTION is PROMOTION!!! | Documentary Of TB Joshua In Nazareth ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±ðŸ”¥
    <br>Who are we fighting for?
    <br>Is it God or ourselves?
    <br>Who can fight for God?
    <br>Before and after the event, they came to the same venue
    <br>to stop T.B. Joshua with their ritual sacrifice.
    <br>You can see them spraying their ritual substances but it was all in vain.
    <br>T.B. Joshua continued nevertheless until he finished what the Lord had sent him to do in Nazareth.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>T.B. Joshua, you were able to go to the revival in Israel
    <br>and call the name of Jesus in public for the first time in 2000 years.
    <br>Not only that.
    <br>Healing, deliverance, signs and wonders took place in His name.
    <br>What do you have to say?
    <br>Acts of Apostles 4:18-19.
    <br>You only need to hear, "Go!" from above, from Heaven.
    <br>Who are you to say "No"?
    <br>When God says "Yes", no man can say "No".
    <br>The noise of north and south,
    <br>the noise of east and west does not matter.
    <br>It only promotes.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>This is what happened before and after the event.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>T.B. Joshua was able to do what the Lord had sent him to do there.
    <br>Stay tuned to watch the revival that could have been stopped, if not for God.
    <br>I quote T.B. Joshua:
    <br>You just need to hear 'Go!' from above.
    <br>Above all powers, above all kings.
    <br>The noise of north and south, the noise of east and west does not matter.
    <br>It only promotes.
    <br>In the aftermath of the meeting however, there was a remarkable change
    <br>in the views of the local people towards T.B. Joshua,
    <br>having seen for themselves the physical and spiritual benefits of his visit.
    <br>Joshua is good.
    <br>Nazareth loves him.
    <br>All the people of Nazareth and Israel know Joshua.
    <br>Joshua is amazing; he does a very interesting thing for Israel and all over the world.
    <br>He is a holy man.
    <br>I believe in Joshua. 
    <br>Yes! Joshua!
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>He brought 10,000 tourists to this city; they filled the hotels.
    <br>The economy of the city has prospered.
    <br>No one visits Nazareth!
    <br>I thank T.B. Joshua for bringing tourists.
    <br>We did not just prosper economically but socially as well.
    <br>Socially, getting to know new cultures and interacting with new people,
    <br>you get out of your shell; you get to know other people's worlds!
    <br>Where or when would you have such an experience?
    <br>Would you like T.B. Joshua to visit Nazareth again?
    <br>Definitely! And not only T.B. Joshua but all his followers as well!
    <br>I met someone from England but she is originally from Jamaica. She came here.
    <br>I never met a Jamaican before.
    <br>I am very happy!
    <br>All the people here are happy but they do not speak out, maybe because they are afraid.
    <br>It is a very new thing - a good thing.
    <br>How did the visit of T.B. Joshua help your business?
    <br>People stayed in hotels and bought shoes, dresses, caps and water.
    <br>They drank and ate.
    <br>The only problem was that they didn't drink alcohol!
    <br>My name is Solomon, I am from Jerusalem.
    <br>I watch T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I was in Istanbul and I saw on Facebook what was happening in Nazareth.
    <br>I was really surprised.
    <br>It is amazing and very special.
    <br>He is very well known and famous.
    <br>All my friends watched him and were really surprised with what happened.
    <br>I hope he will come to Jerusalem and pray for me.
    <br>It is good for the people of Nazareth.
    <br>We are blessed he is here.
    <br>My name is Mohammed, I am from Jaffa, Israel.
    <br>I am 23 years old.
    <br>This is the first time I am seeing Jewish and all kinds of people in Nazareth.
    <br>Welcome to Nazareth!
    <br>Good Morning, Nazareth!
    <br>T.B. Joshua is a wise and understanding man.
    <br>He has been given a great talent from God and is fulfilling his duty - the rest is for God Almighty.
    <br>I am telling you, he is a scientist and a really wise man.
    <br>A vast number of people follow this man.
    <br>He is definitely not an ordinary man.
    <br>Good Morning, Nazareth!
    <br>We were walking through historic sites and went down to the old market;
    <br>we were looking for a present for our daughter.
    <br>As were trying shoes, one of the shop vendors asked, "Joshua, Joshua?"
    <br>I said, "Yes!" He asked if we were there and I said, "Yes".
    <br>Then, he mentioned about the gentleman who got healed from blindness
    <br>and the different colours he could see.
    <br>The vendor said he watched it on TV as it was broadcast on local TV.
    <br>And the other gentleman went off and came back with fruit for us - that was a lovely gesture.
    <br>Prior to the visit of Prophet T.B. Joshua, everyone was talking about it.
    <br>For several weeks, we had a lot of conflict among the people here.
    <br>He was at the centre of any conversation between two regular guys.
    <br>It made a lot of impact on the people.
    <br>The opinion of the people - there was conflict;
    <br>some were for and some were against the visit of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My personal opinion was that it helped Nazareth,
    <br>as Mr Ali Salam said that it was really helpful for Nazareth.
    <br>Felix, from Nazareth.
    <br>I love Joshua.
    <br>Joshua is very good.
    <br>He is the biggest man in the world - Joshua!
    <br>I am from Nazareth and I saw what he was doing.
    <br>What did you see him doing?
    <br>I saw him doing this (praying for people).
    <br>And what happened after that?
    <br>I don't know - they were (vomiting).
    <br>Joshua, come back to Nazareth!
    <br>We love you, Joshua!
    <br>For me, the event of T.B. Joshua was very good and peaceful.
    <br>He gave us peace in our hearts because he believes in Jesus Christ.
    <br>I think it was a very good and happy day.
    <br>I would like to tell him, "Thank you, Joshua!"
    <br>We hope that you will come back here for another event and all over the world, not just Nazareth!
    <br>The people of Nazareth - some of them didn't like it or accept it but some of them did
    <br>and some of them wanted to come but were afraid.
    <br>I think a lot of people want to see this event again.
    <br>Johny, from Nazareth.
    <br>Keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>What can you say about the visit of T.B. Joshua to Israel?
    <br>He came and revived the economic situation.
    <br>Would you like T.B. Joshua to come again?
    <br>Why not?
    <br>He is welcome!
    <br>In a very positive article, the New York Times covered the event.
    <br>The article was titled, "Nigerian Exorcist's Festival draws thousands from around the world."
    <br>Another inspiring article was also found in the world-renowned Reuters newspaper.
    <br>The article was titled, "Worshippers seek Nigerian televangelist's blessing in Nazareth."
    <br>T.B. Joshua also received an official award from the Israeli Ministry Of Tourism.
    <br>ISRAEL 
    <br>MINISTRY OF TOURISM
    <br>Presented In Appreciation To TB JOSHUA
    <br>On the occasion of your visit to Israel,
    <br>I am honoured to recognize you as a true friend of Israel.
    <br>Thank you for your support and solidarity which are deeply appreciated.
    <br>It is my pleasure to name you as
    <br>A TOURISM GOODWILL AMBASSADOR FOR ISRAEL.
    <br>We hope that you will share the meaningful experience of your visit with friends
    <br>and we look forward to welcoming you again soon.
    <br>"And He will teach us of His ways.
    <br>And we will walk in His paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law,
    <br>and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem." (Isaiah 2:3)
    <br>Signed by the Minister of Tourism.
    <br>Who can battle with the Lord?
    <br>As Acts 5:38-39 says,
    <br>"Therefore, in the present case I advise you:
    <br>Leave these men alone! Let them go!
    <br>For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
    <br>But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men;
    <br>you will only find yourselves fighting against God."
    <br>"Even though there was rancor, it was an act of God!"
    <br>The persecution we suffer in the hands of our detractors
    <br>causes us to be known all over the world...
    <br>The best is yet to come!
