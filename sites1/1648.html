  <p>    
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>There is a woman and her husband.
    <br>You fought in the morning at home before coming here.
    <br>Even inside the church.
    <br>If I don't call you out today, you may likely leave the church without greeting each other
    <br>and that will rob your blessing.
    <br>I'm calling you out now, to put every difference behind you.
    <br>I know the journey has been long and this has been there for a long time.
    <br>Come out, the Lord wants to intervene into this matter.
    <br>So, what is the issue?
    <br>Suspect, suspect.
    <br>Please come out.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>TB Joshua: FUNNY PROPHECY and RECONCILIATION!!! 🤣
    <br>I said there was trouble in the house.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>And you people had that trouble before coming to the church.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>If I'm not calling you people, you will still have the same trouble outside.
    <br>That is true, sir.
    <br>The trouble will continue and whatever happens today will not bring you together.
    <br>It is true, sir.
    <br>What about you?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>OK, you stand there.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Captain Godwin A.K., I'm a marine captain.
    <br>I came from Delta State.
    <br>This is my wife.
    <br>I am here to confirm the prophecy of the man of God to be true
    <br>in the sense that since I was transferred to Bayelsa on June 22, 2010,
    <br>my wife has been suspecting me of having a lady friend there
    <br>whom I hired a house and equipped the house for and issued cheques to.
    <br>Whereas, when she demands money, I will be complaining
    <br>that I don't have money, which is not true.
    <br>I tried to make my wife to understand that my going to Bayelsa to work
    <br>is not for fornication but to do my work and at the same time, for the work of God
    <br>but despite all that, she did not accept it from me.
    <br>That is what brought us here.
    <br>My name is Mercy.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>The prophecy that the man of God gave is true.
    <br>Since my husband left to work in Brass, Bayelsa,
    <br>he started behaving strangely in the home.
    <br>Before he left for Brass, Bayelsa, we were living well.
    <br>But after he left, he started behaving strangely.
    <br>When he comes home, his action would be different as if he wasn't my husband.
    <br>That is how it has become.
    <br>My husband was promoted and transferred to Brass, Bayelsa, given a car,
    <br>free accommodation and feeding but he borrows.
    <br>Every month we pay.
    <br>This made me ask him what was making him borrow money in Bayelsa.
    <br>At the time we were here together, he didn't borrow money.
    <br>Now he is transferred and promoted and he starts borrowing money.
    <br>TB Joshua: FUNNY PROPHECY and RECONCILIATION!!! 🤣
    <br>That is what I asked him.
    <br>One day he told me that when he is home, he is mine.
    <br>But when he goes back to work... then he paused.
    <br>So, I asked him, when you come home, you are mine
    <br>but when you go over there, who do you belong to?
    <br>After he paused, he said he belonged to God.
    <br>I said it was a lie.
    <br>We continued talking like that.
    <br>I told him we had come here and the prophet had prayed for us.
    <br>Things had changed.
    <br>I had had it in mind to come and give a testimony.
    <br>Then he came to tell me this.
    <br>I asked him, so the Anointing Water you brought from here works like that, for fornication?
    <br>But I read on the Anointing Water that it's for salvation.
    <br>So, your own is for fornication?
    <br>TB Joshua: FUNNY PROPHECY and RECONCILIATION!!! 🤣
    <br>That fight passed.
    <br>A phone call came.
    <br>When the phone call came, he looked at the phone and put it in his pocket.
    <br>I looked at him.
    <br>After he looked at the phone, he put it in his pocket.
    <br>Then, he received the call.
    <br>When he received the call, he shouted, "What? What? What?"
    <br>He shouted.
    <br>Then, I heard the woman on the phone asking, "Why are you shouting at me?"
    <br>Then, I said that it was a woman's voice I heard
    <br>and that he should give me the phone and let me answer the woman.
    <br>TB Joshua: FUNNY PROPHECY and RECONCILIATION!!! 🤣
    <br>He kept the phone.
    <br>That caused a fight. It was not a small fight.
    <br>We fought. It was not a small fight.
    <br>He said he had explained enough.
    <br>He kept the phone so I went later to collect the number.
    <br>Then, I called the number.
    <br>The woman answered.
    <br>I told her that the man she had called earlier was with me in the car and is my brother.
    <br>I asked her what happened to make her shout.
    <br>TB Joshua: FUNNY PROPHECY and RECONCILIATION!!! 🤣
    <br>I told her that the man was my brother.
    <br>She asked if I was talking about the man from Delta.
    <br>I said yes.
    <br>She said he was her man.
    <br>I said, really?
    <br>I told her that man she claims to be hers, is my husband.
    <br>That's what I said.
    <br>I said that that man is not a small child,
    <br>that I had given birth to nine children for him and that we have grandchildren.
    <br>I told the woman just like that.
    <br>The woman hung the phone up on me.
    <br>She did not speak to me again.
    <br>After speaking to her that day, it was not just a small fight we had in our house.
    <br>Wow; you have listened to that.
    <br>The reason why the problem continues is because our father has not submitted,
    <br>has not acknowledged his weakness.
    <br>Look at the evidence on the ground.
    <br>If they go home now - another trouble.
    <br>In cases like this - it is total deliverance...
    <br>Our father listened to everything.
    <br>What is on the ground now?
    <br>Going by what our mummy is saying,
    <br>whether the woman is your sister or your business partner,
    <br>the way and manner that woman talked to our mummy here was very rude, very bad.
    <br>And I know your sister cannot talk like that,
    <br>your business partner will never talk to your wife like that.
    <br>It must be either your enemy or your friend.
    <br>TB Joshua: FUNNY PROPHECY and RECONCILIATION!!! 🤣
    <br>An enemy means somebody who wants to destroy your home.
    <br>And a friend who will talk like that is as bad as your enemy.
    <br>What kind of friend can talk like that? That is the question.
    <br>I was telling you that love never belittles anyone.
    <br>Don't belittle your wife.
    <br>Love perseveres for the best which is yet to come.
    <br>This woman knows the best is yet to come for this family.
    <br>That is why she takes care.
    <br>She has not abandoned the home, carried the property and left.
    <br>Love welcomes opposing views for examination.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Love welcomes opposing views for examination.]
    <br>Now, we have come to a point that we don't even need attention - we need grace of God.
    <br>The grace should cover the family, so that the family can live together again.
    <br>This is a family from God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>TB Joshua: FUNNY PROPHECY and RECONCILIATION!!! 🤣
    <br>So, you are free.
