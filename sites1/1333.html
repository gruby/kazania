  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, people of God!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Greet your neighbour again, say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Tell the viewers who are watching us, "Good Morning and welcome to His presence!"
    <br>Give thanks to Him!
    <br>Give thanks to Him for allowing you to be here today.
    <br>Give thanks to Him for removing all the barriers and allowing you to be here today.
    <br>Let someone say, "It has been done already!"
    <br>What you are looking for...
    <br>Say, "What I was looking for, it has been done!"
    <br>Therefore, rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah! Do you know why I say that?
    <br>Because the Bible says God is always one step ahead of you.
    <br>You are not here by chance; you are here by God's invitation.
    <br>Therefore, thank You, Jesus!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Today, we are happy and joyful because we are in His presence.
    <br>In His presence, there is fullness of joy, fullness of life because the Miracle Worker is still alive -
    <br>His name is Jesus Christ!
    <br>God has given you a promise. You have a promise; I have a promise
    <br>I don't know what you are going through but I want you to remember something.
    <br>There is a promise of God for your life.
    <br>Stop concentrating on what you are passing through now.
    <br>What you have been passing through is for a purpose.
    <br>Any moment from now, you will see reason to say,
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus, for my salvation, for my healing, for my breakthrough".
    <br>Brethren, God has a promise - a good promise for all of us
    <br>but many have not yet taken hold of the promise of God in their life.
    <br>Why?
    <br>There is a question we need to answer.
    <br>What does Jesus Christ require from you, from me, before He heals me, blesses me,
    <br>saves me and grants me that mighty breakthrough?
    <br>Remember His Words in the Book of Matthew 21: 21-22.
    <br>The Master says, 'Whatever you ask in prayer, believe you have received it
    <br>and you will see it fulfilled'.
    <br>Can this be true for your life?
    <br>Say neighbour, "Can this be true for you?"
    <br>Can this be true for you today?
    <br>It is one thing to believe in the promise of Heaven
    <br>and it is another thing to take hold of it.
    <br>It requires you to actively reach out by faith and take hold of it.
    <br>Our duty is to obey the Word of God;
    <br>God's duty is to fulfill His promise and God is faithful.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, just believe!"
    <br>The time has come! The hour has come - just believe!
    <br>This leads us to the title of our message this morning:
    <br>THE UNCOMPROMISING DEMAND
    <br>Let's take our bibles to the Book of Hebrews 11.
    <br>I start my reading from verse 1.
    <br>It says:
    <br>"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
    <br>For by it the elders obtained a good testimony.
    <br>By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God
    <br>so that the things which are seen were not made by things which are visible.
    <br>But without faith, it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe
    <br>that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him."
    <br>You are in His presence; you must believe in His promises.
    <br>Say, "Lord, I believe".
    <br>God speaks to us through the Holy Words.
    <br>Holy Words means Spirit and life -  Words of the Holy  Spirit.
    <br>Jesus speaks to us through the Holy Words,
    <br>reveals His view concerning a certain matter and thus gives us a promise.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, the promises of God are recorded in the Holy Bible.
    <br>Jesus speaks to us through the Holy Words,
    <br>reveals His view on a certain matter in your situation and thus gives us a promise.
    <br>Faith comes from such a promise.
    <br>Let someone say, "His Word is my rule - His grace - my principle".
    <br>His grace means not the work of righteousness which we have done
    <br>but according to His grace by faith in the finished work
    <br>of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>He gives you a promise. Faith comes from such a promise.
    <br>This means faith without a promise is not real faith.
    <br>Faith without a promise is not real faith.
    <br>You have to believe.
    <br>Just believe -  there is a promise for you.
    <br>Healing is for you, Deliverance is for you. Salvation is for you.
    <br>They are for whosoever wills.
    <br>You have to believe the promises of God.
    <br>The promises are recorded in the Holy Bible.
    <br>Therefore, the Bible says there is no reason for faith as good as God's Word.
    <br>God's Word is the basis of our faith.
    <br>Therefore, our looking into the promise of God, our looking into God's glory, power and might
    <br>is a very good reason for looking to God for mercy.
    <br>And there is no reason to stop looking, to stop praying, to stop asking
    <br>until God withdraws His Words.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, never give up!"
    <br>There is no reason to stop asking until God withdraws His Words.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Today, many upon hearing the promise of God say, "Yes, I claim!"
    <br>We are sometimes guilty of using empty words.
    <br>An empty profession of faith cannot help us in any way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Claiming a promise is not faith.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, claiming a promise is not faith".
    <br>Claiming proves that that one has not got it yet.
    <br>Claiming proves that the one who claims has not received it yet.
    <br>Claiming is unbelief attempting to act like faith.
    <br>Jesus says clearly, 'Whatever you ask in prayer,  believing, you receive'.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Unbelief can quote the Scripture but does not act on it.
    <br>That is what we call mental assent.
    <br>Mental assent recognizes the truthfulness of God's Word but never acts on it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Faith is practical".
    <br>Brethren, when we talk about mental assent, let's remember what happened to
    <br>the seven sons of Sceva in the Book of Acts 19.
    <br>The Bible says out of unbelief, they were attempting to act faith.
    <br>They were merely claiming the authority in the name of Jesus, "whom Paul preaches",
    <br>not Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom the Holy Ghost reveals - Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Bible says when we resist the devil by faith in the name of Jesus Christ, he will flee away from us
    <br>but when we use the name of Jesus like a spell, the devil will prevail over us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, today is my day!"
    <br>Today is your day!
    <br>What you are asking for, what you are waiting for is at hand.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When I say it is at hand, it is because the Bible says that faith has it.
    <br>Faith already possesses it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A man of faith will say, "Thank You, Jesus, for healing me," even if the pain is still there.
    <br>A man of faith will say, "Thank You, Jesus, for blessing me,"
    <br>even if the signs of poverty are still howling around you.
    <br>When Jesus came to the graveside of Lazarus in John 11:41,
    <br>Jesus lifted up His eyes to Heaven and began to thank the Father.
    <br>He said, "Father, I thank You for hearing me because I know You always hear Me".
    <br>John 5:15 says that if you know that God has heard you, whatever you ask you receive.
    <br>This means if God hears me, it is as good as an answer.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, if God hears me, it is as good as an answer".
    <br>As you are sitting down, thinking about your trouble, listen to these words:
    <br>The Bible says you must believe that it has already been done before you pray.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, you must believe that it is done even before you pray
    <br>because very much is promised to our believing".
    <br>Faith in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
    <br>faith in the finished work of our Lord  and Saviour, Jesus Christ
    <br>is not a risk but a sure and practical act.
    <br>Faith in the finished work of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus says that it has been done;
    <br>it is a past tense victory.
    <br>It is a past tense healing.
    <br>It has already been done. The way has been made plain for you.
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>Faith is a demonstration.
    <br>Faith is an application.
    <br>Faith is a demonstration.
    <br>Faith is an application.
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>This means faith in God is not a risk but a sure and practical act.
    <br>The man of God says, "What is the difference between belief and faith?"
    <br>I am standing in front of you. I'm seeing this fruit; I say, "This is fruit".
    <br>I can see it. I believe it is fruit. That is belief.
    <br>But that fruit is far from me.
    <br>There is a barrier, I'm locked in here.
    <br>As long as I don't apply faith, the belief in my heart will remain dormant, inactive, locked in the box.
    <br>So, what is the position of faith?
    <br>Faith is action. Faith is an application.
    <br>What do I mean by that?
    <br>Faith has the key. Faith will open the door.
    <br>Faith will open the door to pave the way for me to enter.
    <br>Faith is my movement towards God.
    <br>Faith is my movement towards the promise of God.
    <br>Faith is my movement towards God.
    <br>As long as I don't apply faith, I just contemplate; by faith, I take hold of it and I take it.
    <br>Faith takes hold of the promise of God.
    <br>Let someone say, "Faith takes hold of the promise of God".
    <br>This means we can only apply the promise of God in our life through faith and by faith.
    <br>Faith is action. Faith is practical.
    <br>When I say, "I believe" - let someone say, "I believe".
    <br>Remember - 'I believe, help me overcome my unbelief.'
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>If I pray, say, "In the name of Jesus", the Bible says belief starts.
    <br>But after I say, "Amen", faith must start its work.
    <br>By faith, I apply, I make manifest the promise of God in my life.
    <br>By faith, I apply the promise of God in my life.
    <br>Whatever you receive from God today will come as a result of your actively reaching out
    <br>and taking hold of the promises of God set before you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Believing demands action".
    <br>You have left your home. You have left your country.
    <br>Now, you are here in the presence of God, don't allow any doubt to stand between you and your faith.
    <br>Look at the case of Abraham.
    <br>In Genesis 15:5-6, God showed to Abraham the promise of the mighty future -
    <br>the mighty promise he had for Abraham.
    <br>God used stars to motivate his faith for children.
    <br>Abraham believed the promise of God and he acted faith immediately.
    <br>The Bible says he checked out of the warm arms of his family members, left his country,
    <br>left everything and ventured into faith life.
    <br>He walked towards the promise of God for his life.
    <br>Faith is my movement towards God.
    <br>He went and never looked back and took hold of all of the promises of God.
    <br>Today as you are sitting down here -
    <br>there is a promise of God for you.
    <br>That promise is available for you today.
    <br>You can take hold of it today.
    <br>Say, "I'm ready! My heart is ready!"
    <br>Ask Abraham and he will tell you that appropriating faith
    <br>takes hold of the promise of God.
    <br>Appropriating faith takes hold of the promise of God.
    <br>How do we appropriate?
    <br>1. Simply believe what God has said.
    <br>Simply believe the Word of God that God will do exactly what He has promised to do.
    <br>2. Be fully persuaded by God's Word alone -
    <br>not by what you see, what people say, what your circumstances look like.
    <br>Abraham was old but he never allowed the age to cause him to doubt the promise of God.
    <br>He was fully persuaded.
    <br>3. Hold fast to your confidence in God's Word even when your faith is tested.
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>1. Simply believe the Word of God, that God will do exactly as He has promised to you.
    <br>2. Be fully persuaded, be fully convinced by the Word of God alone -
    <br>not by what you see, what you hear or what your circumstance look like,
    <br>even if it seems worse.
    <br>3. Hold fast to your confidence in God's Word even when your faith is tested.
    <br>That is faith for you.
    <br>Let someone say, "Faith is practical".
    <br>Faith has its own work.
    <br>If you believe God in a certain matter, you must have a work of faith in that matter.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, when you believe God in a certain matter,
    <br>you must have a work of faith in that matter.
    <br>If you pray in the name of Jesus and believe the Lord has heard you, you have it.
    <br>When I say, "In the name of Jesus", belief starts praying
    <br>because I believe - I pray.
    <br>But after I say, "Amen", faith starts its work.
    <br>There is more to the "Amen".
    <br>After "Amen" you must apply faith.
    <br>After the "Amen", faith is doing its work.
    <br>What is the work of faith?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that
    <br>prayer for any special object must be followed by an attitude of absolute trust in God.
    <br>that He is working out the answer for you.
    <br>Prayer for any special object must be followed by an attitude of absolute trust in God
    <br>that He is working out the answer for you.
    <br>Leave it for God.
    <br>Worry no more.
    <br>Faith stops praying and begins to praise God
    <br>Faith stops worrying and begins to smile because God has done it.
    <br>Let someone say, "God has done it".
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Do you believe it is done?
    <br>Let me see your joy!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God has set a table before you this morning.
    <br>On that table, you have the necessities of life.
    <br>All you need to live for God - joy, peace, a life full and free, healing, deliverance, breakthrough -
    <br>it is yours for today.
    <br>It is yours for you today.
    <br>Finally, Romans 1:17.
    <br>The Bible says my righteous shall live by faith.
    <br>In the light of this Scripture,
    <br>we know we are faced with God's uncompromising demand for faith.
    <br>Without faith, we cannot please God.
    <br>Without faith, we cannot approach God
    <br>Without faith, we cannot receive His life, His righteousness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God's Word means the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>In the Word of God, all you require, all you need is in that Word you are holding.
    <br>Healing, salvation, breakthrough, all of God's blessings are in your hands.
    <br>They are soon to be revealed. Are you ready for that?
    <br>Say, "Lord, I believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"
    <br>By faith, I stretch my hand. By faith, I believe. By faith, I confess. By faith, I act.
    <br>Faith believes now.
    <br>Faith acts now.
    <br>Faith receives now.
    <br>You are healed. You are blessed. You are delivered.
    <br>God bless His Word. Give thanks to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Lord I believe
    <br>Help me overcome my unbelief
    <br>Lord I believe
    <br>Help me overcome my unbelief
