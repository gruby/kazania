  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Damian.
    <br>I'm from Benue State, Nigeria.
    <br>I'm an Uber driver.
    <br>He is my friend from Ghana.
    <br>This is my mum.
    <br>This is my auntie.
    <br>I'm here today to testify of the goodness of God in my life through the ministration of the new Morning Water.
    <br>On the fateful day, I woke up in the morning.
    <br>I went out for my daily job.
    <br>In the evening, I came home around midnight.
    <br>Upon getting to my street, I was tired.
    <br>So I could not reach my house.
    <br>I parked near my house for me to rest.
    <br>Before I knew it, unknown gunmen attacked me.
    <br>That is the only thing I know.
    <br>The next thing, I found myself somewhere - somewhere I didn't know.
    <br>The person I saw where I found myself was my late dad who died many years ago.
    <br>He now called me for me to come.
    <br>It took a first, second step to reach where he was.
    <br>Children of God, I saw the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Mr Damian, Friend & Family
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>He now called me to come back.
    <br>I now turned and followed him.
    <br>So when I was going with him, I turned to look at my father again.
    <br>I did not see him.
    <br>That was how I woke up and I found myself in the hospital.
    <br>I now saw my friend.
    <br>I asked him, "Where are we? Where am I? What are we doing here?
    <br>I'm just closing from work".
    <br>He then laughed and told me that I was attacked.
    <br>My name is Philip. I'm from Ghana.
    <br>The man beside me is my friend Damian.
    <br>He is an Uber driver, and that is the mum and auntie.
    <br>Actually, I'm a business man. Most of the time, I come here to Lagos to do importation.
    <br>Any time I come, I call him; he is the one that normally takes me around.
    <br>So this fateful day, I came on the 10th of August.
    <br>I was in the hotel room and received a phone call around 3 to 4 am in the morning
    <br>that my friend was dead and I was like, "How?"
    <br>The person who called indicated that my friend was dead.
    <br>They took him to the hospital.
    <br>So I rushed to the general hospital.
    <br>On getting there, I realised that he was in a pool of blood.
    <br>According to those who saw him at the beginning, he was attacked by armed robbers.
    <br>They beat him and thought he was dead.
    <br>They threw him into the dustbin and left him there.
    <br>It was the security man that was passing by who knew where he was
    <br>and they found him and took him to the hospital.
    <br>Immediately the doctor asked me whether I was a family member.
    <br>I said, "No, I'm a friend. But if there are any bills, I'm ready to pay for him".
    <br>The doctor said, "Ok, if that is the case, they could not do anything over there".
    <br>So we had to transfer him to Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
    <br>We took him there. On getting there, they rushed him to the emergency ward.
    <br>When the doctors came - there were many of them -
    <br>first of all, the ones who were going to operate the head.
    <br>He was in coma at that time.
    <br>He could not see anything, he could not breathe, nothing - he was dead.
    <br>Let me put it that way: He was dead.
    <br>They were going to operate the head, eyes and teeth.
    <br>They were going to look for three different specialists -
    <br>the dentist, the one for the head and the one for the eyes.
    <br>At that time, they told me that the bills would be at least 2.5 before they could take care of him.
    <br>Even if he comes back, he will not be a normal person again.
    <br>So I was like, "Oh. This one - how am I going to handle this?"
    <br>Then, I didn't know any of his family members and everything relied on me.
    <br>I could not go anywhere; I had to stay in the hospital with him.
    <br>I said, "Okay. I will take it upon myself.
    <br>Any bill, even if it takes me to sell everything I have, I'm ready to do it to take care of him".
    <br>Mr Philip & Friend
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>The doctor gave me a list of things they are going to buy for the first operation.
    <br>They wanted to do the head first.
    <br>I remembered that I had the Morning Water which the man of God had given to me.
    <br>I had then already withdrawn the money; I was having the money in my bag.
    <br>But I said, "No, let me prolong them a bit and see what will happen
    <br>because through the Morning Water, I know God can do something".
    <br>Mr Philip & Friend
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So I decided to prolong the doctors.
    <br>When they asked me to bring the money or buy something, I told them I didn't have money.
    <br>It was on a Friday.
    <br>When they told me to bring the money for payment or buy the items they told me to buy,
    <br>I told them that I didn't have money - just to prolong them.
    <br>So through that, I was ministering the Morning Water on him.
    <br>I administered the Morning Water first on the head and the eyes after the three days.
    <br>Suddenly, he just woke up.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean, your friend that was in coma -
    <br>when you started ministering the Morning Water on him, that was how he came back to life.
    <br>That was how he just came back.
    <br>And he came back with a word, saying, "This is sweet".
    <br>after I had ministered the Morning Water into the mouth.
    <br>He said, "This is sweet. Minister more; put more".
    <br>I put more; I kept on ministering...
    <br>Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>They even used him for a case study whereby all the students around came -
    <br>just to use him as a case study to teach the students.
    <br>I knew this man was condemned already for them to use him as a case study.
    <br>You are no longer a human being.
    <br>They said that on Monday morning, they were going to take him to the theatre.
    <br>I said, "Okay".
    <br>Early Monday morning when they came - the three of them, all the specialists -
    <br>when they came, the first one looked at the head
    <br>and he said, "Wow. We don't need any surgery again".
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Immediately, he took pen and paper and wrote, "We are discharging him on your part".
    <br>So the one for the eyes came and said, "Hm, your friend is healed.
    <br>The eyes will be clear by itself so we don't need to do anything again".
    <br>Mr Philip & Friend
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>And he also discharged him on his side.
    <br>Remaining the dentist.
    <br>Initially, the dentist told me that they were going to use 16 screws -
    <br>both from here - down, and from here - down to hold the teeth.
    <br>And each one is 15,000 Naira.
    <br>And then they were going to use something called 'German anchor'.
    <br>I don't know - medical whatever.
    <br>Each one they were going to use - 10 of them - and each one is 8,000 Naira.
    <br>So the doctor looked at him - that was the dentist - after the other two had discharged him.
    <br>That one looked at him and said, "No, I won't need all the screws again.
    <br>All what I need to do is a simple and minor operation that will not cost much".
    <br>Wow. Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>Ok, brother. Can I ask you a question?
    <br>Why do you think all these specialists were like -
    <br>they had already told you they were going to do the operation;
    <br>it would take months for him to recover -
    <br>why did they suddenly change and say, they were not doing it?
    <br>Because I continued ministering the Morning Water.
    <br>And he started healing, even without doing the operation.
    <br>Without doing the operation.
    <br>To God be the glory. Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>Later on, they took him - that is, the dentist took him to the theatre
    <br>just to fix the teeth with a 'German anchor'.
    <br>And he told me it was going to take six months for him to recover.
    <br>In these six months, he would not eat anything - only liquid.
    <br>He was in the hospital.
    <br>After he came back, I continued ministering the Morning Water.
    <br>Anything they said we should give him - medication and everything -
    <br>I ministered the Morning Water in it and I gave it to him through a straw
    <br>because then, he could not open the mouth.
    <br>Three days - I mean, three days - the doctor came back, checked him
    <br>and said, "This thing needs to be removed.
    <br>That the teeth are strong enough for him to chew bones".
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>And that was when he was discharged.
    <br>Six months turned to six days.
    <br>Wow. Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>From there, I got to know where the mother was
    <br>so I decided to send transportation for the mother and the sister to come and help him
    <br>because then, I could not do so many things.
    <br>That was when I sent the transportation to the family and they came down.
    <br>They are now in charge by taking care of him.
    <br>Ok, we can see a board beside our brother.
    <br>Can you tell us - what are the pictures on the board that we are looking at.
    <br>Mr Philip & Friend
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>As you can see, this is when they picked him from the dustbin.
    <br>There was no car to take him in so they used a condemned bus that was around to pick him.
    <br>This one - he was gone already.
    <br>This was when we took him to the general hospital.
    <br>This one - he was dead and gone.
    <br>The doctors referred us as they could not do anything about it.
    <br>That we should go to LUTE (Lagos University Teaching Hospital).
    <br>And here is when he was still in coma in the theatre at LUTE.
    <br>You can see the eyes.
    <br>Both of the eyes were condemned.
    <br>And this was after the surgery.
    <br>Look at what they put in the mouth.
    <br>When they put this in your mouth, can you be a human being again?
    <br>This was what they put in the mouth.
    <br>It took three days to remove them.
    <br>And here is what they used to hit the head.
    <br>And you can imagine, you are just seeing this side.
    <br>But the head like this - down was cracked.
    <br>It cracked down.
    <br>So they wanted to fix the whole thing.
    <br>But through the ministration of the Morning Water, all this thing was healed within three days.
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>The same yesterday, today and forever!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Indeed, our God is a miraculous God.
    <br>To God be the glory. Thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in the life of our brother,
    <br>restoring him back to life; someone that could have been a dead person.
    <br>But through the medium of the New Morning Water, God Almighty restored him back to life.
    <br>There was something I forgot - whilst ministering the Morning Water.
    <br>There was a man - an elderly man - who was suffering from Parkinson.
    <br>He was shaking; you would see him shaking on the bed.
    <br>Immediately I ministered the Morning Water, the elderly man called me at my back and said,
    <br>"My son, please, is it the Morning Water from Prophet T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>I said, "Daddy, please, yes".
    <br>He said, "Can you minister it to me".
    <br>I handed the whole bottle to him, "Daddy, please take and minister it upon yourself".
    <br>And he did. The following day, they discharged him.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Wow. To God be the glory.
    <br>So that means that the New Morning Water was not only for your brother.
    <br>It was also for everyone.
    <br>For everyone.
    <br>Wow. We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in your life and the life of our brother.
    <br>So now tell us, brother - what can you say concerning this New Morning Water?
    <br>The New Morning Water is the medium God has given us freely to heal, save and deliver.
    <br>Whatever problem you are suffering from, be it HIV, hypertension,
    <br>Hepatitis B, whatever being the case -
    <br>just use a drop of it and you will be whole.
    <br>You will be free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>When he was in the hospital, I remembered that I needed to go back to the police station
    <br>and report the case because then, there were no family members around.
    <br>On getting to the police station, I saw the car parked there.
    <br>So I asked, "How come?"
    <br>They said, "The same morning they recovered the car -
    <br>when the armed robbers were trying to use the car to rob somewhere,
    <br>they got them and recovered the car immediately that morning".
    <br>Wow. To God be the glory.
    <br>Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>So not only did God heal him and restore him back to life,
    <br>his means of livelihood that could have been taken away from him,
    <br>God also brought it back to him.
    <br>Wow. We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in your lives.
    <br>My brothers and sisters, I was dead; I was gone.
    <br>I did not know what was happening.
    <br>But God brought me back to life through this Morning Water.
    <br>Mr Damian, Friend & Family
    <br>New Morning Water Testimony
    <br>My advice to the viewers, especially the taxi drivers:
    <br>Every time you are going out in the morning,
    <br>ask God, pray to God, tell Him to take over your life,
    <br>tell Him to lead you and bring you back safely
    <br>because without Jesus, I would not be alive today.
    <br>To my brothers and sisters, let us ask from God first, any time we are going out.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much for that wonderful advice.
    <br>Our brother is telling us that we should involve God in everything that we do,
    <br>put God first in everything that you do
    <br>because the greatest decision you can make in life is to put God first in everything you do.
    <br>We also want to advise you, our brother,
    <br>as God has done this for you, make sure you make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>and live your life in tune with God's Word
    <br>so it shall continue to be well with you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
