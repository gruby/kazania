  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I was waiting for a result.
    <br>And what is the result?
    <br>If we say rain will wipe this epidemic out of the earth, it must start from Wuhan, China -
    <br>where the whole thing started.
    <br>Right now, it is raining there.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>If you have people there where the coronavirus started, call them;
    <br>they will tell you it is raining.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>This is not supposed to happen in that place at this season but it is raining.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>And what is the purpose?
    <br>To wipe out this epidemic called coronavirus.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Whether you come in contact with the rain or not, that does not matter.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>If there is any story about that epidemic, coronavirus, it's a past-tense event.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>It has become a past-tense event.
    <br>You can still be hearing some stories
    <br>but the Lord said to me the rain will fall - a shower of rain.
    <br>You know, it is not normal in Nigeria for the rain to fall at this time.
    <br>In many communities the rain fell yesterday, even in the night, in Nigeria.
    <br>Talk of Peru - read the history of Peru; it was raining yesterday because the Lord said it.
    <br>If the Lord said it, who can say no?
    <br>So that is it. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Thank you. We are here today.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>You know what it means for you to go there by yourself -
    <br>you will get ordinary tap water.
    <br>You understand?
    <br>If you just leave now and go there by yourself, you will get ordinary tap water.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>If you decide, "I'm going" without carrying God along.
    <br>Our relationship with the Lord is founded upon His mercy.
    <br>Have mercy upon me.
    <br>You need mercy.
    <br>Let this continue to go on and on in your heart.
    <br>On and on in your heart.
    <br>If you want to receive God's mercy, continue to ask for God's mercy.
    <br>If you will not receive the judgement you truly deserve...
    <br>You know the judgement you truly deserve?
    <br>Ask for God's mercy
    <br>if you do not want to receive the judgement you truly deserve.
    <br>You know where you are coming from.
    <br>And you know the nature of the job you are doing.
    <br>You know the relationship you keep.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You know where you are coming from".
    <br>You know the kind of job you are doing
    <br>and you know the relationship you keep.
    <br>Right now, begin to ask for God's mercy
    <br>if you do not want to receive the judgement you truly deserve.
    <br>What is the judgement you truly deserve?
    <br>It is time right now.
    <br>Listen to me. Try to understand what I'm saying.
    <br>Ask your neighbour again, "You know where you are coming from.
    <br>You know the kind of relationship you keep.
    <br>You know the kind of job you do".
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>And you want to come here to ask Him,
    <br>I mean, to get the favour, the healing
    <br>with the nature of job, life you live, where you are coming from.
    <br>Our relationship with God is founded upon God's mercy.
    <br>Have mercy upon me, Son of David.
    <br>This is what you need - you need the mercy of God.
    <br>Ask if you do not want to receive the judgement you truly deserve.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you do not want to receive the judgement you truly deserve,
    <br>ask for the mercy of God".
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[If you do not want to receive the judgement you truly deserve, ask for the mercy of God.]
    <br>Have mercy upon me.
    <br>If you do not want to receive the judgement you truly deserve -
    <br>the judgement you truly deserve is to get there and get tap water
    <br>and you just see people vomiting, getting healed, getting delivered
    <br>but you don't get there and get your tap water.
    <br>Since yesterday when the Lord brought the revelation about rain -
    <br>that this rain will wipe away all this epidemic, coronavirus,
    <br>I said, "If that is the case, my people are 'Thomas'; they must see.
    <br>If they don't see, they cannot believe".
    <br>I said to the Lord that this thing should happen where the coronavirus started,
    <br>which is a place called Wuhan, China.
    <br>Say, "Wuhan".
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Right now, it is raining there.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>And it will continue till the end of this week.
    <br>To close it up, it will continue.
    <br>It must go round the world.
    <br>Can you see that since yesterday - that fear - it's like you don't feel any fear again.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Because if not God, you would have started greeting your brother with your leg.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Ok. So thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Look at the screen.
    <br>See what is coming out.
    <br>What you can see right now are stones that this man has vomited out.
    <br>He has vomited out stones right now.
    <br>You can see he is still manifesting.
    <br>You see what is coming out?
    <br>And this is a gentleman that has been sitting since morning.
    <br>He has been with you people since morning but nothing like this happened.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>He has been with you since morning but why now?
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Why now?
    <br>Ask yourself, "Why now?"
    <br>Why now? - that is the question.
    <br>This is to tell you that I'm not coming here alone.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>If I came at my own time, they would not come with me.
    <br>This is 6 pm - it is too late.
    <br>But since morning, I have been asking for permission to come out.
    <br>They said, no, God's time is the best, I should wait for them.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>They said what?
    <br>That I should what?
    <br>Did you wait for them to come here?
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Did you wait?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Did you wait for them to come here?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Did you wait to come here?"
    <br>Did you wait for them?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Did you wait for them?"
    <br>You come alone.
    <br>This is why you need mercy.
    <br>You come on your own.
    <br>You come alone.
    <br>You are here alone.
    <br>This is why I'm saying, if you should go there by yourself,
    <br>you will get ordinary tap water.
    <br>Are you here for ordinary tap water?
    <br>Are you thirsty?
    <br>A young man that has vomited out four stones as you can see on the screen.
    <br>He vomited them out instantly as the man of God came out to the congregation.
    <br>You can see the spirit in him still manifesting.
    <br>Tell us: Who are you?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "He has signed, so he has to finish the pact".
    <br>For you to know that this man is not in our midst, see the way he is sweating.
    <br>Ok, which language is that? Go ahead.
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I am the goddess, he belongs to me; he signed a pact with me,
    <br>he wants money".
    <br>Stones And Poisonous Substances Vomited
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Ok. We can see something on the floor here. What is this?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "He has accepted my proposal and he has signed a pact with me".
    <br>Look. Please, can you release him. Just release your hand.
    <br>Ok, look here.
    <br>Remove your hand. Leave him.
    <br>Sometimes when you give them so much honour...
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Ok. Don't run away. Wait. Come here.
    <br>Ok. Talk now.
    <br>We are not fighting the flesh and blood.
    <br>I am from the Central African Republic; I don't know what happened!
    <br>He says he doesn't know.
    <br>Ok. Go and show him his own stones.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>He said he doesn't know what happened.
    <br>Show him the stones. Maybe I'm the one vomiting the stones.
    <br>Ok. Don't worry. If you say it, I will take it back to the realm again.
    <br>Look at what you have vomited on the floor!
    <br>Ok. What is he saying?
    <br>I don't know who vomited...
    <br>Look here!
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Ask him! Come on!
    <br>Tell us who vomited those stones we are seeing on the floor!
    <br>What happened? Talk!
    <br>Tell us who vomited those stones we are seeing on the floor right now?
    <br>Yes, it is me!
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Stones And Poisonous Substances Vomited
    <br>This is what the Bible says:
    <br>It's not by power
    <br>It's not by might
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>This mountain has been removed
    <br>This mountain has been removed
    <br>In Jesus' name
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>So that is it.
    <br>He said he was not owner of the stones.
    <br>If he is not the owner of the stones, I'm the one who vomited the stones.
    <br>Because he has now come back to his normal senses.
    <br>So can you see? This is to tell you that what is happening to kill and destroy is not ordinary.
    <br>To lie is not ordinary.
    <br>To deceive your neighbour is not ordinary.
    <br>Ordinarily you don't want to do that but there is a spirit.
    <br>Can't you hear what Paul the Apostle said in the Book of Romans:
    <br>He said, what I'm doing is not what I intend to do.
    <br>If I now find myself doing this, there is something still in me.
    <br>Where I am going is not where I intend to go.
    <br>But if I now go, it is not me that is going there; there is a force.
