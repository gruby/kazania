  <p>    
    <br>During The SCOAN Sunday Live Service, as Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers Spirit-filled prayer to the people
    <br>who have visited from different countries, to have an encounter with Jesus Christ,
    <br>every chain of darkness, sickness and affliction is broken in their lives, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Come. Just stand here, in the spot where this man was healed.
    <br>Stand in the spot.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Remove it.
    <br>OK
    <br>Healed in Jesus' Name
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I am free. My family is free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Praise be to God!
    <br>My name is Bwaanje Ng'andu and I am from Zambia.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of the Lord.
    <br>As you saw on the clip, I was here due to lumbar and cervical osteoarthritis.
    <br>I was advised to wear a neck collar because I was in severe pain.
    <br>Every time I put on that neck collar I would feel a little bit of relief.
    <br>For how long did you suffer from that problem?
    <br>This problem has tormented my life for 9 good years.
    <br>Can you tell us how it affected your day-to-day living?
    <br>I couldn't stand for a long time; sitting for a long time was also an issue.
    <br>It gave me severe pain in my neck that spread to my left ear and my eye
    <br>and I would have migraine headaches that would last for days.
    <br>And apart from the stiff neck, can you tell us the other problems that you also experienced
    <br>within that 9 years?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Like I said earlier, I had lumbar osteoarthritis, which led to scoliosis,
    <br>which is the curving of the spine sideways.
    <br>We can imagine the terrible condition you have been in, suffering those 2 terrible problems.
    <br>Can you tell us how you got to know about The SCOAN,
    <br>as you were here last Sunday to receive your healing?
    <br>I got to know about The SCOAN through DSTV, when they introduced Emmanuel TV there.
    <br>So I would watch it and through watching it my faith was uplifted
    <br>and I realised that this condition would be over in the moment I presented it to God.
    <br>Hallelujah. So you were here last Sunday.
    <br>What was the way in which God Almighty used the anointed servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua to set you free?
    <br>We saw how the man of God instructed you to step to the same spot,
    <br>where the first man was healed.
    <br>Can you just share with us what happened to you in the moment
    <br>you moved forward and were in the same spot that the first man was healed?
    <br>The moment I stepped to that spot, I just felt calmness, relief.
    <br>At that moment, I realised that it was all over.
    <br>Hallelujah! Shall we put our hands together for Jesus?
    <br>Hallelujah! We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>We watched on the clip how the sister received her healing.
    <br>She is here testifying that the moment man of God instructed her
    <br>to move and step in the same spot the man was healed,
    <br>she saw that all the pain and agony she was having became a thing of the past.
    <br>Can you just exercise your neck; turn your neck to your left and right and tell us how you are feeling?
    <br>Right now, I can turn my neck to the left, to the right, not feeling any pain.
    <br>Before, when I did this, I would feel pain here but the pain is no more.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Can you also take some steps forward?
    <br>I can run.
    <br>Before, when I ran, I would feel pain in my spine but now the pain is no more.
    <br>I can bend.
    <br>I don't feel like my spine would break - nothing...
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for this faith building testimony.
    <br>As you know, somebody needs to listen to your own testimony
    <br>to get them out of their own desperate situation.
    <br>And we know that this testimony you have just heard has lifted your faith to another level.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be having, Jesus Christ is more than able to see you through.
    <br>Beloved, never worry, never become depressed - God is a solution to everything.
    <br>Hallelujah. We know that Jesus Christ is the solution to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>He has proved it in the life of the sister.
    <br>She came here with a terrible condition but today she is hale and healthy.
    <br>We give glory to God. Put your hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So, we want to advise you sister that as God Almighty has set you free through His Word,
    <br>you must go and be ruled by His Word.
    <br>Make God's Word the standard for your life, and we know better is not good enough,
    <br>the best is always yet to come, in Jesus' name.
