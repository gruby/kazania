    <br>Oh God who created mountains of those days
    <br>Only You we give all of our praise
    <br>It’s You who created mountains of those days
    <br>Only You we give all of our praise
    <br>Who then must be lifted high
    <br>If not our Heavenly Father
    <br>Who then must be given all of our praise
    <br>Who then must be lifted high
    <br>If not our Heavenly Father
    <br>Who then must be given all of our praise
    <br>Who then must be lifted high
    <br>If not our Heavenly Father
    <br>Who then must be given all of our praise
    <br>It’s You who created mountains of those days
    <br>Only You we give all of our praise
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Be calm; Jesus is on the throne”.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Our viewers, thank you.
    <br>Whatever you are using to view us, we salute your faith.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Last week we talked so much about relationship and challenges for Christians.
    <br>We are going to land today.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>1 Peter, chapter 2.
    <br>We start our reading from the beginning and later we will go to the proof text.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>“Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice
    <br>and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.
    <br>Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,
    <br>now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.”
    <br>Indeed, the Lord is good.
    <br>Hallelujah; let's go to the proof text here - verse 15.
    <br>“For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
    <br>Live as free people..."
    <br>That is, live and let me live; live and let others live. Think about that.
    <br>"...but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil.”
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We title our message: 
    <br>RELATIONSHIP UNDER REPAIR.
    <br>This text we read, you will also find it in other books:
    <br>1 Thessalonians 5:15.
    <br>Also when you look at the Book of Matthew 7. You take your reading from verse 12,
    <br>And the book of Romans, which will be the "landing" - Romans 3:10-15.
    <br>Our relationship is under repair of which everyone can agree with me.
    <br>Your relationship - everyone's.
    <br>You agree with me - your relationship is under repair.
    <br>It is not yet repaired completely, but is under repair.
    <br>Just like a vehicle you use,; you discover a fault; you have to give it to the mechanic.
    <br>When you ask, "Where is my vehicle?" - "It is under repair."
    <br>- "Where is my car?"
    <br>- "It is under repair."
    <br>We don’t have to look far to find things we do not like in our society.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>We don’t have to look far to find things we do not like in our society.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look through your immediate surroundings
    <br>and what you may see seems to be frightening.
    <br>Immediate, just look at your back. If not, because you are in the church.
    <br>Out there, at the bus stop, at the market, anywhere -
    <br>if you just stand, looking at your immediate surroundings,
    <br>you will probably see someone, who is ready to kill you if you are not leaving there.
    <br>Very very frightening.
    <br>Economic oppression – poverty everywhere.
    <br>Even if you have money, you cannot move freely again because of people that lack - you will be afraid.
    <br>What you have is not even enough to calm people around you.
    <br>Many of us - we don't live at our home anymore.
    <br>They say, "Are they at home?"
    <br>You call your wife, "Are they at home?"
    <br>"No, I will sleep there."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Political oppression – injustice and misrule everywhere.
    <br>You will hear some people say, "Will I vote? How will I vote?
    <br>How will I know that my vote will be this, that?"
    <br>Injustice and misrule everywhere, all over the world.
    <br>There is nowhere to run to.
    <br>In the past you could run this way but now it is like there is no way to run to.
    <br>Are you talking of religious oppression – intolerance and violence.
    <br>You just go anywhere and say, "What religion do you belong to? Are you this? Are you a Christian?"
    <br>Everywhere - fear.
    <br>Institutionalised corruption everywhere.
    <br>That is why the Book of 1 Peter 2:15 says that by doing good, you will silence the bad people around you.
    <br>In the face of all this, let us be known as people who are for good, not just against the bad.
    <br>Don't continue being busy talking, "It's not good".
    <br>If it’s not good, what have you done to change the bad you see?
    <br>If care is not taken, people will see you as a complainer.
    <br>Let us be known as people who are for good, not just against bad.
    <br>Because it is temptation; everything - I mean, we Christians today see temptations everywhere.
    <br>Something is there to make you curse, to make you talk.
    <br>Let us be known as people who are for good, not just against the bad in our society.
    <br>A little example can have a big influence.
    <br>You see me; for many years you people have been crucifying me, in the past.
    <br>When you move around many places of worship, you hear, "T.B. Joshua - rebuke him, ban him".
    <br>I was not engaged in, "You - you are not good. Ban him".
    <br>We are not banned, but you keep banning.
    <br>But here, we keep doing what is right, to change the bad we have seen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A little example can have a big influence.
    <br>Instead of being against your neighbour
    <br>because of bad behaviour and character,
    <br>we should try to do what is right to help him improve.
    <br>Instead of being against poverty, "See them; what are they doing; they are lazy!",
    <br>you should make a tangible contribution towards the society.
    <br>There are many people in your home, where you are living - their children are not going to school.
    <br>You always see them at home, but your children are going to school.
    <br>You don't need to see their parents, "What are you doing, little boy?"
    <br>"Oh, my mummy cannot pay my school fees, my daddy cannot pay."
    <br>"That is why I always see you around. Can you tell your parents that I want to support you?"
    <br>The child will run to the parents, "Daddy, mummy, this mister said he wanted to pay my school fees".
    <br>"Oh, thank you, sir."
    <br>Instead of saying, "What are these children doing? Look at these stupid children;
    <br>they are not going to school - stupid."
    <br>No!
    <br>When we see something that needs to be improved,
    <br>when we see something that needs to be removed,
    <br>when we see something in our society that needs to be changed,
    <br>when we see something that needs to be adjusted,
    <br>we must recognise our personal responsibility to do something about it.
    <br>"Ah - this is not right. This is how they have been doing that - it is very bad."
    <br>I'm not saying you should not condemn or criticize, but at the same time you should also look at
    <br>how that thing can be improved or changed.
    <br>This is where we are today, all over the world.
    <br>Everybody takes on the side of criticism, criticizing, "Bad, bad! It is not good!",
    <br>but we have never looked at the other side again.
    <br>When we see something that needs to be changed,
    <br>that needs to be adjusted,
    <br>that needs to be removed,
    <br>that needs to be improved in our society,
    <br>we must recognise our personal responsibility to do something about it.
    <br>As Christians, we have to take responsibility for our actions
    <br>because that is the only way we learn.
    <br>You must choose to do the right at all times
    <br>Though it’s contrary to what you really want
    <br>But the Spirit should lead you by and by
    <br>Then what counts is the essence of the true Church
    <br>That is the message to you.
    <br>After leaving the service today, you see many things under the chair - biscuits, whatever, we drop it.
    <br>You just leave it. You say, "Some people are coming to clean the church".
    <br>Which is...
    <br>As Christians, we have to take responsibility for our actions
    <br>because that is the only way we learn
    <br>and if we keep learning, we will improve.
    <br>If we improve, we become more mature in our Christian life
    <br>and in time, we will earn the right to operate on the level we deserve.
    <br>You have not operated on the level you deserve.
    <br>That is why you want to do something, "I don't understand my dream.
    <br>I don't know whether I should do this or not."
    <br>If you are operating on the level you deserve, there will be discernment.
    <br>When you move, there will be a force that will tell you, "Move this way, that way."
    <br>Not that you consult your neighbour to know where to go.
    <br>That is why we can do ten jobs at the same time; you are an architect, engineer, lawyer,
    <br>you are doing a lot of jobs, because you don't know the one that will bring breakthrough,
    <br>because you have not yet operated on the level you deserve.
    <br>You have so many jobs you are doing; you are the contractor, lawyer,
    <br>at the same time you travel to buy and sell.
    <br>You have so many business cards in your pocket; you don't know what to do because of failure.
    <br>Because you have not yet operated on the level you deserve.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Romans 3.
    <br>You take your reading from verse 10.
    <br>“As it is written: ‘There is no one righteous, not even one;
    <br>there is no one who understands.’”
    <br>There is no one who is righteous, not even one.
    <br>All have fallen short of the glory of God.
    <br>If that is the case, it means in this life, we are going to make mistakes.
    <br>When we do, as Christians, we must understand that mistakes are correctable.
    <br>We must think about what we did.
    <br>"Ah, yesterday, oh my God..."
    <br>You must think about what you did, reflect and ask yourself:
    <br>Is this the kind of person I want to be – a liar?
    <br>Is this who I am – a killer, a destroyer?
    <br>And so on and so forth.
    <br>Reflect and ask yourself:
    <br>Is this the kind of person I want to be – a liar, a destroyer, a smoker, a drunkard?
    <br>As a Christian?
    <br>Is this who I am?
    <br>Examining our life is a good thing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Examining our life is a good thing.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Examining our life is a good thing.]
    <br>That is the key Jesus has given us.
    <br>Others – they don’t examine their lives.
    <br>That is why they do more of that mistake
    <br>but as true Christians, we examine our lives; it’s a good thing.
    <br>Few things are more dangerous than a person with an unexamined life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Examine your life".
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Examine your life.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Is this the kind of person I want to be – a liar, a murderer?
    <br>This or that?
    <br>Is this who I am?
    <br>Let me quickly take you to the short note of Apostle Paul; that is the Book of Philemon 1:8-19.
    <br>That will be your manual to help you strengthen your relationship.
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself:
    <br>Do you easily get along with people
    <br>or are you guilty of the following I am about to mention, concerning the short note to Philemon?
    <br>Ask yourself:
    <br>Do you easily get along with people
    <br>or are you the type criticising instead of praising?
    <br>No matter what you do - you find you are not the one, you criticize.
    <br>There is nothing good to you, to find that you are not the one that did it.
    <br>You are the type that criticises instead of praising.
    <br>Instead of giving a tap, "Good. It's wonderful",
    <br>since you are not the one that did it, "No, this one is not good" - you are this type, are you?
    <br>Criticising instead of praising.
    <br>Using insensitive words.
    <br>Refusing to admit wrong.
    <br>"No, no..."
    <br>We are talking of relationship under repair.
    <br>Belittling others’ opinions.
    <br>"This is how to do. It is not like that. This is how we do it."
    <br>Making jokes at others’ expense.
    <br>Not listening to others.
    <br>This kind of attitude will wreck relationships
    <br>and hinder the healing of past hurts.
    <br>The Book of Philemon; chapter one - you take reading from verse 8 to 19 - that will really help you.
    <br>I pray the Lord will give you a hearing heart.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I pray the Lord give you a hearing heart, in Jesus Christ’s name.
    <br>Amen.
