    <br>The principle source for finding ourselves recreated is the Bible.
    <br>There is no substitute for it.
    <br>It was given by the inspiration of God, as holy men were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Right now, discover more about yourself and God who created you, as you watch today's
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit to position you where He will be interested
    <br>in whatever you say here and whatever you do.
    <br>TRUST GOD'S AUTHORITY NOT MAN'S MAJORITY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>Remember, when the Holy Spirit speaks to you, changes are beginning.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When the Holy Spirit talks, obey."
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>TRUST GOD'S AUTHORITY NOT MAN'S MAJORITY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The Word of God is the instrument of peace for the Holy Spirit to use.
    <br>I can assure you the Word of God today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Our proof text shall be taken from Ephesians 2:8.
    <br>"For by grace you have been saved through faith,
    <br>and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God."
    <br>For by grace you have been saved through faith.
    <br>It is not your power or might.
    <br>This will lead us to the title:
    <br>The Best Man By Faith
    <br>Say, "The best man by the grace of God."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Everybody cherishes breakthrough.
    <br>That is why we work hard.
    <br>Little do we know that the battle is not always for the strong
    <br>and the race is not always for the swift.
    <br>After struggling, after hard labour, after running helter skelter,
    <br>God will still have to mark our work.
    <br>That is the meaning of grace.
    <br>Not the work of righteousness which you have done but according to His grace.
    <br>No man knows by the signs what will happen next.
    <br>This is why we must pray as if everything depends on God
    <br>and work as if everything depends on us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Pray as if everything depends on God.
    <br>Work as if everything depends on you."
    <br>The best man in the world holds his integrity
    <br>no longer than God upholds him in it.
    <br>I mean, the best man in the world can only maintain his position and honour
    <br>as long as God keeps him in it.
    <br>Because honour attracts hatred, persecution.
    <br>No one can survive attack without God.
    <br>Because attacks come from satan and he will not be the one to protect you.
    <br>He cannot be the one to attack you, and also be the one to protect you.
    <br>Attack comes from him - God protects.
    <br>TRUST GOD'S AUTHORITY NOT MAN'S MAJORITY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>If we were to be left to ourselves, we would fall and the enemy would triumph.
    <br>I mean, if God withdraws His support, His protection, His love from us,
    <br>we would fall and the enemy will laugh at us.
    <br>God knows that we are naturally fearful and weak when we are facing trials.
    <br>In that Ephesians 2:8: "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
    <br>and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God."
    <br>This is why today one would think that in a warfare, in a battle,
    <br>the numerous and powerful soldiers should always be victorious.
    <br>One would think in our society today that the great,
    <br>the intelligent, the understanding, who are masters of the art of management,
    <br>should always be men of substance
    <br>but many a good man there are unnoticed, uncelebrated.
    <br>Where would I be
    <br>You only know
    <br>I'm glad You see
    <br>Through eyes of love
    <br>A hopeless case
    <br>An empty place
    <br>If not for grace
    <br>Where would I be
    <br>You only know
    <br>I'm glad You see
    <br>Through eyes of love
    <br>A hopeless case
    <br>An empty place
    <br>If not for grace
    <br>Where would I be
    <br>You only know
    <br>I'm glad You see
    <br>Through eyes of love
    <br>A hopeless case
    <br>An empty place
    <br>If not for grace
    <br>Amazing grace
    <br>How sweet the sound
    <br>I once was lost
    <br>But now am found
    <br>A hopeless case
    <br>An empty place
    <br>If not for grace
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>At a certain period in life, we find ourselves being unduly hated and persecuted
    <br>because of the grace of God in our life.
    <br>Anything in your life that tends to defy the logic of people's imagination
    <br>is therefore to be highly resisted and fought to a standstill.
    <br>This is life for you.
    <br>Integrity is not something that we can prove
    <br>by outward beauty and prestige alone.
    <br>These are the external qualities.
    <br>Remember, God does not judge as people do.
    <br>Man judges by outward appearance but God looks at the heart.
    <br>TRUST GOD'S AUTHORITY NOT MAN'S MAJORITY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Integrity is not something that we can prove
    <br>by outward beauty and prestige alone.
    <br>He who desires to be victorious must be ready to embrace war.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "He who desires to be victorious must be ready to embrace war."
    <br>Because victory is a product of warfare.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Victory is a product of warfare."
    <br>My brothers and sisters, the best man in the world can only maintain his integrity
    <br>as long as God keeps him in it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The best man in the world can only maintain his integrity as long as God keeps him in it.]
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is better not to achieve than to achieve and fall.
    <br>TRUST GOD'S AUTHORITY NOT MAN'S MAJORITY! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Therefore, when it is time to pray, don't ask God, "Bless me, bless me."
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace to maintain.
    <br>Anybody can achieve but not everyone can maintain.
    <br>Think about it.
    <br>You have received so much.
    <br>Even what you are asking for today, you had it in the past.
    <br>We failed to maintain the blessing of God.
    <br>You trust man's majority instead of God's authority.
    <br>This is the society you find yourself in.
    <br>We have 4 types of people in our lives;
    <br>those who multiply, those who divide, those who add, those who subtract.
    <br>Each of those kinds will affect your life in a positive or negative way.
    <br>This is what I mean by, "Trust in God's authority, not man's majority."
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Trust in God's authority, not man's majority.]
    <br>You with God are a majority.
    <br>[You with God are a majority.]
