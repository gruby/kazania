    <br>Look closely; a blind man is being led by the hand onto the altar.
    <br>Unable to see, he walks slowly, as a friend carefully guides him to an area where he can pray.
    <br>A Blind Man Is Guided Onto The SCOAN Altar For Prayer
    <br>A friend continues to guide and support, as he struggles to find his step,
    <br>as he makes his way up the altar stairs.
    <br>A Blind Man Is Guided Onto The SCOAN Altar For Prayer
    <br>As instructed by Prophet T.B. Joshua, the blind man washes his face and eyeballs
    <br>with the Living Water, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Blind Man Washes His Face With The Living Water On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You can see from the excitement on his face that something radical has happened.
    <br>Yes, the man who was once blind can now see, to the glory of God.
    <br>He enthusiastically shakes hands with the people around him,
    <br>rejoicing in his supernatural healing.
    <br>He makes his way throughout the altar all on his own
    <br>because he is now able to see where he is going.
    <br>Yes, as it was prophesied in Isaiah 35:5, "The eyes of the blind shall be opened".
    <br>Indeed, the age of miracles has not passed
    <br>because the miracle Worker is still alive - His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's hear the man's testimony.
    <br>I am John Mugerwa from Kampala, Uganda.
    <br>My problem was a tumour on my pituitary gland
    <br>that sat on my optic nerves and made me blind.
    <br>I came here with people who assisted me to move around.
    <br>I was being assisted by them but now, I can walk freely!
    <br>My name is Adrian Mihambo.
    <br>I am staying in the same room with him.
    <br>We had to lead him to the dining room and everywhere he wanted to go because he could not see.
    <br>I assisted him to the altar.
    <br>I led him to the altar where the ushers took over and directed him to where the Living Water was.
    <br>To my surprise, I saw him coming walking alone and seeing clearly!
    <br>I am surprised and I am very happy!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus for healing my friend from Uganda.
    <br>I am very happy!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is John Mugerwa. 
    <br>I am from Kampala, Uganda.
    <br>By profession I am a businessman.
    <br>My friend here is Adrian Mihambo.
    <br>He was my room mate from Tanzania.
    <br>I had to walk with a guide. Steven here is a son of my sister in-law; he guided me here.
    <br>Tell us what was the problem that brought you to The SCOAN.
    <br>Suddenly, I developed headaches.
    <br>I took several medications, had an operation, but all was in vain.
    <br>Healed Of Blindness
    <br>Living Water Testimony
    <br>I had an X-ray and MRI.
    <br>It was found that I had a tumour in my brain that pressed my optic nerves and made my eyes blind.
    <br>As all failed to work, we arrived here to Lagos.
    <br>We want you to tell us for how long you have been having this problem of blindness,
    <br>due to this tumour that rested on your optic nerves.
    <br>For 7-8 years.
    <br>It has affected me so much.
    <br>I have been staying at home, being guided by members of my family
    <br>while going to the toilet, going wherever I would go, to churches...
    <br>That is how it has affected me.
    <br>So you were always being guided because you could not see.
    <br>Of course I couldn't see, I was not seeing at all.
    <br>So now tell us what happened on Monday.
    <br>On Monday, at 8 am, our coordinators came to our rooms
    <br>and they were calling us to come to church.
    <br>There was an opening of the altar by Holy Spirit.
    <br>My guide was not around.
    <br>It was my room mate, Adrian Mihumbo from Tanzania;
    <br>he took my hand, we walked along together and we sat in front of the altar.
    <br>In the meantime we were told we were to get the Living Water.
    <br>During the course, the voice emerged.
    <br>It was the voice of the Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>saying, "Be ready. You are going to enter the altar."
    <br>He said, "Those people with problems in their eyes should try to wash
    <br>with this Living Water. It will help them."
    <br>Then we proceeded step by step, in order, until we reached the Living Water.
    <br>My friend took the container I had, he took the water.
    <br>I washed one time, a second time, a third time - I couldn't believe.
    <br>It was wonderful.
    <br>It was as if I was in a dark room and someone opened a big door.
    <br>I could see lights, I could see people, I could see colours.
    <br>Jesus delivered me.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus for delivering me.
    <br>Thank You for healing me, thank You for delivering my family.
    <br>So now you can walk by yourself, without being aided.
    <br>I can walk, I can tell even the colours.
    <br>This is a blue jacket, black trousers, and black shoes.
    <br>Where I am standing - this is blue, this is green, this is a white woman.
    <br>Oh!
    <br>Healed Of Blindness
    <br>Living Water Testimony
    <br>My advice is to follow Jesus, stick to Jesus - He is the King of kings.
    <br>He died for our sins and all our pains and diseases.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>My name is Adrian Mihambo from Tanzania.
    <br>The man beside me is my friend John Mugerwa from Uganda.
    <br>Next to him is his son.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, I found myself with Mr Mugerwa as a room mate.
    <br>He was blind.
    <br>He told me he was sorry and that he was totally blind.
    <br>So all the time his son was leading him wherever he wanted to go.
    <br>On Monday, when we were invited to climb the altar,
    <br>his son was not around in the room.
    <br>So, he said, "My friend Adrian, lead me to the altar, so that we can get the Living Water."
    <br>I led him up to the altar.
    <br>When the man of God opened the altar and addressed us to climb, I led him step by step.
    <br>When we reached the Living Water, after washing his face for the first, second and third time,
    <br>I was surprised when he screamed, "I can see now! I can see clearly."
    <br>To prove that he was seeing, I tried again to hold his hand so that I could lead him.
    <br>He refused saying, "I can go by myself. I can see clearly now!"
    <br>So I was very excited and happy.
    <br>I am very happy, I glorify God for what He has done to my friend Mugerwa.
    <br>What you are telling us is that when you were leading your friend to the Living Water,
    <br>he was completely blind and he could not see at all.
    <br>Definitely, he was completely blind.
    <br>I had to lead him, telling him, "Step your foot here, you do this, you kneel here."
    <br>I wanted to lead him step by step because he could not see completely - he was blind.
    <br>So you were surprised when he washed his face with the Living Water
    <br>and he took his hand from you and was able to see and walk himself.
    <br>Oh yes, I was surprised and I was happy for him.
    <br>I had a proof that he could see because he could walk by himself in front of me,
    <br>instead of me leading him, as I was doing.
    <br>My word of advice to people listening and watching me here is that
    <br>they should have faith in God.
    <br>There is nothing impossible to God.
    <br>Above all; if they have problems which have no solutions,
    <br>here in The SCOAN there is a solution because there is a Living God here.
    <br>I am Steven.
    <br>Beside me is my friend Adrian.
    <br>Beside him is my father.
    <br>My father was blind, he couldn't see.
    <br>So I was helping him in any way, even reaching here;
    <br>going up the steps, to the toilet I would help him.
    <br>I could help him in any situation because of his blindness.
    <br>He couldn't see at all.
    <br>Wherever he wanted to go, I was the one who escorted him.
    <br>Whenever he wanted to go somewhere to pick up something or to get something to eat,
    <br>I was the one to escort him.
    <br>When we went to the flight, I was the one to guide him through the airport.
    <br>On Monday I was surprised because I was in a bathroom.
    <br>When I came back I didn't find him.
    <br>When I came here to the altar, I called him.
    <br>Surprisingly, when I was sitting, I saw him saying, "I am healed. I am seeing. I am delivered."
    <br>I never knew he was at the altar.
    <br>I just heard him saying that he was healed that he could see and move on his own.
    <br>Tell us what life has been like with him.
    <br>I saw him - before he could not even climb that altar - the friend helped him,
    <br>as he spoke about it.
    <br>I was surprised to see him walking by himself.
    <br>I praise the Lord Jesus.
    <br>Ever since then, he has been doing everything by himself.
    <br>Yes, ever since then he is doing everything by himself.
    <br>So the burden of guiding him all around has come to an end.
    <br>It has come to an end.
    <br>He is doing everything by himself.
    <br>There were usual things like catching him, moving around with him - that is no more.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ?
    <br>From now onwards, me and my family,
    <br>we thank God forever and ever.
    <br>So you can see now?
    <br>I can see very well.
    <br>You are a man.
    <br>Look at the man over there, tell us...
    <br>You see the man in front of you? This man.
    <br>This one is wearing black.
    <br>And the one beside him?
    <br>He wears white.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ?
