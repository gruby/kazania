    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Wherever you are and wherever your sickness, disease is located -
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Dry bones –rise again!
    <br>You, satan, we know your activities, strategies and tactics – we know you!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>You, demon – leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Wherever that affliction – I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, begin to seal your blessings with the blood of Jesus.
    <br>Seal it!
    <br>Seal your blessings with the blood of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
