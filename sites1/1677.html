  <p>    
    <br>Stretch your right hand. The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Let the power of the Lord
    <br>From Heaven above
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>I want you to take your heart back to what happened to the woman on the wheelchair;
    <br>the woman that gave testimony.
    <br>There was a question I asked; I said, "The prayer you are about to offer now,
    <br>is not like the one you were offering in the past".
    <br>It is different because God is involved.
    <br>The prayer you are about to offer now is not a joke.
    <br>So please, I want you to take it seriously.
    <br>Involve your heart as if your life depends on it.
    <br>Right now, involve your heart.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Let the power of the Lord
    <br>From Heaven above
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>We have been here since morning and the prophets have been praying with you,
    <br>deliverance has been going on.
    <br>Jesus will know, there are some that still need to be delivered.
    <br>We look differently. We act differently.
    <br>We believe differently.
    <br>It may be your right time.
    <br>Who knows?
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Open your heart.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Open your heart.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord
    <br>From Heaven above
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>It may be your time; it may be my time.
    <br>Holy Ghost do it again
    <br>Do it again in my life
    <br>Open my eyes to see Jesus
    <br>Seated upon the throne
    <br>Holy Ghost do it again
    <br>Do it again in my life
    <br>Open my eyes to see Jesus
    <br>Seated upon the throne
