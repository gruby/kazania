    <br>Viewers, wherever you are - are you on the sea, in the air?
    <br>Whatever familiar spirit disturbing your joy -
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Affliction, stagnation - whatever challenges you are going through-
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Like I have said, today, we are like Elisha's servant
    <br>who on the outside are fighting
    <br>but within are filled with fear, panic, anxiety.
    <br>We wave our hands in worship but within, filled with fear, panic, doubt, unbelief.
    <br>Whatever familiar spirit disturbing your life, disturbing your joy -
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Yes, have faith in God; all things are possible!
    <br>Whatever challenges, whatever situation you are in -
    <br>be redeemed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Be redeemed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Vomiting Blood & Poisonous Substances
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I'm redeemed! I'm set free!
    <br>I'm healed! I'm free, in Jesus' name!
