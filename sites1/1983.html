    <br>MIRACLE CHILD AFTER BURYING SIX DEAD BABIES!!!
    <br>At the Pastors' Conference in Dominican Republic with TB Joshua
    <br>the power of God falls mightily on all who came.
    <br>As the Word of God says, "When we all gather in the name of Jesus Christ He is present".
    <br>Ministers from around the world fall under the anointing of God
    <br>as TB Joshua is used as a channel of light where there is darkness
    <br>and a channel of deliverance where there is bondage.
    <br>Among the people being prayed for is this couple who came with the problem of barrenness.
    <br>After receiving prayer at the Pastors' Conference with TB Joshua in Dominican Republic
    <br>the couple came to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations to testify about the blessing of God in their lives.
    <br>Let's listen to them.

    <br>God never stops giving us reasons to say, "Thank you".

    <br>My name is Evgheny Lanovoy. This is my wife Innana Lanovaya.

    <br>And this is our daughter Melatrissa.
    <br>We came from Russia.
    <br>We came here to testify about the miracle God gave us, and she is in our hands right now.

    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I had the problem of barrenness.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>When we got married 3 years ago, I knew that it was impossible for us to have children.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>We kept our faith in Jesus Christ and believed we could have a child.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Then we had our first pregnancy.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Two years ago I was pregnant with twins, but I miscarried.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Since then we had five more miscarriages.
    <br>We buried our unborn children that died. The whole year was a nightmare.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I think those who have buried their children understand the pain we went through.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Despite the miscarriages, we believed it was possible; I believed that TB Joshua would be able to help.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>It happened that we attended the crusade in Dominican Republic.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I knew that we would receive our miracle and would be able to give birth to a child.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Two months later I became pregnant.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>We believed that I would be able to give birth to this child and come back to give our testimony.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>You cannot imagine how happy we are to be here to testify about this miracle.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I gave birth to her safely and we are expecting another child, which I conceived 5 months after giving birth.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Because that is our God - the Miracle Worker!
    <br>I would like to address those experiencing a similar problem - only faith can help you get through the pain.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>I know many are experiencing this and I know how they feel.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Only God is able to heal our wounds.
    <br>I am a living testimony.
    <br>Testimony Time 
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Amen! Yes, they are living proofs of what God can do.
    <br>And as He did it for them, He can do it for you!
