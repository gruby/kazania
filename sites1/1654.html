    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>It is the Word in our hearts that gives value of the name Jesus.
    <br>The Word in our hearts.
    <br>When you keep calling the name, Jesus, if that Word is not from your heart,
    <br>the Book of Romans says whatever that is not from our heart is a sin.
    <br>The Word in your heart brings the value of the name Jesus,
    <br>the authority of the name Jesus,
    <br>the legal right of using the name Jesus.
    <br>Beware of the heart.
    <br>Faith is of the heart. Give me your heart.
    <br>Say to the Lord, "Open my heart to Your Spirit".
    <br>Yes, because it is the Word in your heart that gives value of the name Jesus.
    <br>"Let there be light" - it is the Word in your heart.
    <br>"Be healed" - it is the Word in your heart.
    <br>"Be delivered" - it is the Word in your heart.
    <br>The authority of the name Jesus - the Word in your heart.
    <br>The legal right to use that name.
    <br>Anyone can say, "In the name of Jesus".
    <br>But it's not everyone that can say, "In the name of Jesus" in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Say, "Open my heart to Your Spirit".
    <br>Open my heart to Your Spirit. Mean it!
    <br>Mean it, with all your heart. Say, "Open my heart to Your Spirit".
    <br>The Spirit makes us know that believing is possessing.
    <br>The moment you believe, you have.
    <br>The moment you believe, you have what you want.
    <br>Instantly, you would believe.
    <br>The Holy Ghost has been doing it.
    <br>We want Him to do it again.
    <br>Holy Ghost do it again
    <br>Do it again in my life
    <br>Open my eyes to see Jesus
    <br>Seated upon the throne
    <br>Holy Ghost do it again
    <br>Do it again in my life
    <br>Open my eyes to see Jesus
    <br>Seated upon the throne
    <br>In the natural you say "Open my eyes".
    <br>No, you cannot see Jesus - open my heart.
    <br>The original song says, "Open my eyes" but it is "Open my heart" - sing it again.
    <br>Holy Ghost do it again
    <br>Do it again in my life
    <br>Open my heart to see Jesus
    <br>Seated upon the throne
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever spirit that has been holding you in bondage -
    <br>right now, begin to be released!
    <br>Release yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say, "I'm released, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Whatever spirit -
    <br>I'm released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to release yourself right now!
    <br>Release yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>No matter the effort you put in place, without this Word coming from your heart, it is in vain.
    <br>Mean what we are saying; mean it!
    <br>All what you are saying, mean it with all your heart.
    <br>Where can we go from His Spirit?
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself -
    <br>whatever weakness, whatever shortcoming -
    <br>when I say chain, I mean weakness because satan always uses our weakness.
    <br>He is always using our shortcoming.
    <br>He is always using your wrong.
    <br>That is the chain I mean.
    <br>You talk too much.
    <br>Spirit of anger, stealing, conning.
    <br>Whatever that chain - that chain means your weakness.
    <br>There is a wonderful name Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Whatever weakness satan is using to connect you to himself -
    <br>when satan knows you are a liar, he will now use that symptom to connect you to himself.
    <br>He knows you have the spirit of stealing; that is what he is going to use now to drag you to himself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You know you are very lazy; he will use that to get you to himself.
    <br>That is the chain I mean.
    <br>Whatever chain satan is using,
    <br>I mean, whatever weakness satan is using to connect you to himself -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Just listen to me with all your heart so that you know what you are praying for.
    <br>When I say chain, it can be sickness.
    <br>When you have sickness, you will not be able to pray, the kind of thought.
    <br>Talk of poverty.
    <br>Those are weaknesses and all other.
    <br>He only uses those as at bait, to get just as you put fish in a hook.
    <br>Then drop this hook in the sea to get fish.
    <br>Whatever weakness satan is using to get you to himself -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it affliction - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Bad habits.
    <br>Nightmares.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to fire.
    <br>Break it with all of your heart.
    <br>With all of my heart.
    <br>Break it!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomiting Blood & Poisonous Substances
    <br>These are the things that satan is using to get you to himself.
    <br>Nightmares.
    <br>Hardship.
    <br>Satan uses this to get you to himself, to make you look at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>You begin to say, "I used to pay my tithes, I am a Christian, I don't know what is wrong with me".
    <br>What is wrong with you?
    <br>As a Christian, that does not mean that you cannot have a situation.
    <br>Whatever chain satan is using to get you to himself - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It could be doubt. You have so much doubt in your heart.
    <br>You have been at the opposite side - negative.
    <br>Earthly believer - they believe in charm, thunder and all other.
    <br>So now to believe God - absolutely difficult.
    <br>It could be doubt.
    <br>Whatever satan is using to connect you to himself - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That is prayer for salvation.
    <br>You need salvation.
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Chains - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it affliction,
    <br>be it burden,
    <br>be it sickness and disease -
    <br>satan is the manufacturer of these.
    <br>He produces these, he is responsible for these, he is behind all these.
    <br>It is time now to open your lips.
    <br>Whatever that could make you to be thinking, "Where is my Jesus? Where is my God?" -
    <br>that affliction - leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>You affliction -
    <br>wherever that affliction in your organ,
    <br>wherever that affliction in your faculties -
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name  of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it poison -
    <br>whatever poison you might have taken on the table of your enemy, in your dreams -
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever in your system - poison in your dream, poison on the table of your enemy -
    <br>leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomiting Blood & Poisonous Substances
    <br>Every organ - begin to function!
    <br>Begin to function!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, bring your country; pray for your nation.
    <br>Your country, your life - whatever you have as a contact point.
    <br>Pray for your nation; right now stretch your hand.
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>Right now, open your lips and pray for your nation.
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>Ask God to redeem your leaders.
    <br>Redeem my leaders!
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>Ask God to redeem your economy!
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>Ask God to redeem your land!
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>Right now, pray for your journey back -
    <br>righteous journey!
    <br>Ask God to strengthen you.
    <br>Strengthen me, Lord.
    <br>Those of you that are coming to Christ for the first time and those who are here to rededicate their lives -
    <br>right now, say after me:
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me Your channel -
    <br>Your channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Make me Your channel -
    <br> Your channel of love where there is hate.
    <br>Make me Your channel -
    <br>Your channel of obedience where there is disobedience.
    <br>Make me Your channel, Lord -
    <br>Your Channel of faithfulness where there is unfaithfulness.
    <br>Make me Your channel -
    <br>Your channel of forgiveness where there is sin.
    <br>Make me Your channel -
    <br>Your channel of pardon where there is injury, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Right now, you should be ready to forgive;
    <br>you are a channel of forgiveness.
    <br>You should be ready to pardon;
    <br>now you are a channel of pardon.
    <br>You should be ready to love your neighbour
    <br>as yourself; now you are a channel of love.
    <br>That is Christ for you.
    <br>There is nothing born again than that, than to be a channel of love where there is hate.
    <br>Out there, there is hate everywhere.
    <br>Unforgiveness everywhere - you are the channel of forgiveness.
    <br>So you should be ready.
    <br>This is the only way you can keep your blessing and represent God anywhere you are.
    <br>You can say, "I'm born-again" when you are a channel of love.
    <br>You can say "I'm born-again" when you are a channel of forgiveness.
    <br>You can say, "I'm born-again" because you are a channel of pardon.
    <br>You can say, "I'm born-again" because 
    <br>you are a channel of obedience.
    <br>That is what you call born-again.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>Anywhere you are now turned to - disobedience; you should know you are not born-again.
    <br>You find yourself as hate - you are not born-again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>That is your role.
    <br>It is not all up to God; certainly, it is not all up to you.
    <br>Your genuine willingness to be a channel of God and God's ability work together.
    <br>Bless His Holy Name.
    <br>I bless His holy name because I am a channel - a channel of Jesus, a channel of love.
    <br>I bless His holy name because I am a channel of forgiveness.
    <br>I bless His holy name because I am a channel of faithfulness, shining light.
    <br>I bless His Holy Name, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>If I may wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year in advance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I'm seeing a new beginning here!
