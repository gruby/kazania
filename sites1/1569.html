    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua opens up the altar at The SCOAN for the Living Water service.
    <br>He begins kneeling at the base of the altar, praying to God, the Healer;
    <br>His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Effective prayer can only happen through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>Remaining under the influence of the Spirit of Jesus,
    <br>the man of God proceeds to the depths of the altar where the Living Water is kept.
    <br>He turns on the taps, one by one, setting them aside for God's special attention.
    <br>As he takes a small portion of the Living Water from each tap,
    <br>just before demonstrating how to drink it.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>After the Living Water service has been officially commenced,
    <br>the congregants proceed to The SCOAN Altar for prayer.
    <br>As they continually pour their hearts out to God,
    <br>the atmosphere is charged with the presence of the Lord.
    <br>Vomiting Blood & Poisonous Substances
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>My name is Dickson Francisca; I'm from Ghana.
    <br>I had anxiety disorder for 9 months and depression for 10 years
    <br>after the death of my parents.
    <br>The doctors gave me pills that could calm my brain so that I would be able to sleep
    <br>because I was having insomnia.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN Altar to take the Living Water,
    <br>we were told to pray first at the altar.
    <br>As I was coming to the altar, I felt a heaviness in my body.
    <br>As I was praying at the altar, it was as if something came out of my heart
    <br>and burst as tears from my eyes.
    <br>After taking the Living Water, I vomited blood and poisonous substances.
    <br>I started crying. I tried to control myself but I could not.
    <br>Then I saw Someone in white clothes laying His hand on people's head.
    <br>It was as if I was crying at His feet.
    <br>Instantly, I had joy and peace of mind.
    <br>For 10 years, I was depressed; I did not have joy,
    <br>unless I was maybe watching a joke.
    <br>Now, I have inner peace.
    <br>I am free; I am delivered! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Dickson Francisca.
    <br>I'm a Nigerian but currently living in Ghana.
    <br>It all happened when I lost my parents 10 years ago.
    <br>Due to the fact that I was not having the love I was supposed to get from family and everybody,
    <br>I developed this bitterness and depression that I couldn't control.
    <br>I had this hatred for myself and for people and I became isolated
    <br>because I felt that when I got close to people, people would hurt me.
    <br>Then, 9 months ago, I developed anxiety disorder.
    <br>I wouldn't be able to sleep, unless the doctor gave me pills to sleep
    <br>so it could calm the nerves in my brain
    <br>or else, I would be having shock, dizziness and shortness of breath.
    <br>I couldn't go out because I felt like, if I went out, I was going to collapse.
    <br>So I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>During the Living Water service, when it got to my turn,
    <br>I was about to kneel down there at the altar before going to the mountain of prayer,
    <br>it was as if a force of gravity was holding my knees;
    <br>I was feeling something like a magnet.
    <br>I laid my face on the altar.
    <br>Everything I was supposed to say, it was as if my mouth became shut.
    <br>The only thing I know I could speak was, "Have mercy, Lord"
    <br>and everything from my heart, all the pain, everything came out from my eyes,
    <br>rolling down as tears and touched the altar.
    <br>Then it was as if there was something like a lightning in my eyes.
    <br>So when we were ushered to go to the mountain of prayer to pray,
    <br>it felt like something entered my body, I became so heavy,
    <br>that I could not even lift up my legs.
    <br>To the glory of God, I started breathing so hard.
    <br>As I was breathing hard, I took the Living Water and I drank some
    <br>and I washed my face with the Living Water, asking God to favour me
    <br>and I was asking for His mercy.
    <br>Then, the period I drank the Living Water, I started vomiting.
    <br>And behold, my eyes opened.
    <br>And I saw a man in a white apparel, standing like this at the pool where the Living Water is flowing.
    <br>Then, it wiped out.
    <br>I saw another man again in a white apparel, he was glowing.
    <br>His right hand was stretched forth.
    <br>He was placing it on everybody's head that were going on the mountain of prayer.
    <br>And everybody was manifesting, they were vomiting.
    <br>I tried to look at his face - the face was blocked but I could see the hand -
    <br>mighty hands, stretching his hand there.
    <br>Instantly, this inner peace came inside of me.
    <br>I tried to even think about my past but it was as if my memory was seized.
    <br>I became whole again.
    <br>I was overwhelmed with joy.
    <br>I heard a voice, telling me, "It is done".
    <br>At that moment I knew that everybody was blessed.
    <br>I can sleep well.
    <br>I no longer have nightmares.
    <br>I don't dream, I would sleep and wake up, just like that.
    <br>I am fine with people, every grudge and hatred in my heart is gone.
    <br>The most important thing is that I can't remember anything;
    <br>I don't even miss my parents again.
    <br>I'm fine; I'm happy.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Except God opens your eyes, you will not see them.
    <br>God opened the eyes of our sister to see them and to testify
    <br>that that place, there is more to what we see at the mountain of prayer.
    <br>I saw them.
    <br>He was placing his hands on everybody's head; his hands were very fast.
    <br>Assuming it is possible to record it, I would have recorded it.
    <br>I saw him standing there, placing his hands on people's head
    <br>and people were receiving their deliverance.
    <br>Living Water Testimony
    <br>You are a living testimony that depression, anxiety disorder and suicide thoughts has a solution.
    <br>It has a solution, in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>And just tell us briefly:
    <br>because people believe today that the greatest problems are HIV/Aids,
    <br>cancer, tumour and others.
    <br>Tell us as someone who suffered this anxiety disorder, suicide thoughts and depression.
    <br>Can you tell us how bad it really is?
    <br>It was very bad that it got to the extent whereby I could not go out on my own.
    <br>If I did not hold myself and did not pray, I would collapse.
    <br>I had shortness of breath, I was feeling dizzy for nine months.
    <br>I couldn't go out, everything I was hearing was, "You are going to die".
    <br>My dreams were all nightmares - I saw graves, dead people, people dying.
    <br>My whole life was shattered.
    <br>It even affected my career.
    <br>Because when you are going through such a thing, you can be grounded as a cabin crew.
    <br>The whole thing affected my life.
    <br>So what would you wish for everyone who is listening to your testimony now.
    <br>Not only have I had it; I have seen it.
    <br>I have felt it and I have experienced it that the presence of God is here.
    <br>Jesus Christ Himself is here.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is here.
    <br>His angels are everywhere - 24/7, ready to do miracles.
    <br>They are here.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Living Water Testimony
    <br>Presence of the Lord is in this place
    <br>The power of the Lord is in this place
    <br>I can see His power over me
    <br>His anointing changing me
    <br>I can feel His power over me
    <br>His anointing changing me
    <br>My life will never be the same
    <br>Your life will never be the same
    <br>Our lives will never be the same
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>The presence of the Lord is in this place
