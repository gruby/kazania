    <br>On Saturday 11th of July 2020
    <br>God's General Dr Morris Cerullo was called home to eternal glory as a citizen of Heaven.
    <br>As Philippians 3:20-21 says,
    <br>"But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Saviour from there,
    <br>the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control,
    <br>will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body."
    <br>The legacy of Dr Morris Cerullo will forever live on in the hearts of believers worldwide,
    <br>especially the millions who came to the knowledge of saving grace through his ministry.
    <br>Raised in an orthodox Jewish orphanage, Morris had received a divine call to preach,
    <br>when he was only 15 years old.
