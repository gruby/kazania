  <p>    
    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>Welcome back, viewers, and welcome, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Sir, you are welcome back from the prayer mountain
    <br>and thank you so much for coming today.
    <br>We have received so many emails.
    <br>Point of correction! Prayer Mountain?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Any place can be a prayer mountain;
    <br>it is all about the state of our heart.
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>Prayer mountain.
    <br>Our heart is the prayer mountain;
    <br>our heart is the prayer room.
    <br>My going to the mountain -
    <br>I went there just to have a rest.
    <br>Just to have a rest.
    <br>Many people prefer to be
    <br>in an atmosphere of technology,
    <br>atmosphere of modern-day technology.
    <br>I choose to be in an atmosphere of nature -
    <br>not just nature, a frightening one,
    <br>very frightening - just to rest.
    <br>I remember last time when you were going to the prayer mountain, you traveled to Switzerland.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Viewers, thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much, sir.
    <br>We have received so many emails with questions from our viewers all over the world.
    <br>You can see them here.
    <br>We realized that so many of the questions were concerning a very particular topic.
    <br>So I want to read the question that our brother here asked and it really reflects the mind our viewers.
    <br>So the person writes thus:
    <br>Good morning, Prophet T. B. Joshua.
    <br>My question is this: How do we get the Word of God into our lives?
    <br>I mean, how do we make the Word of God an integral part of us?
    <br>It is such an important question because we realized
    <br>today, many people profess they are Christians
    <br>but they are not such in heart.
    <br>- Many of us.
    <br>- Many of us.
    <br>Humility.
    <br>Many of us. Not "many of them". Many of us.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Even though you may not be one of them, but you add yourself to appeal to them.
    <br>Ok, go ahead.
    <br>Many of us say we are Christians but we are not such in heart.
    <br>And we can see the evidence of that.
    <br>Leave that for God to judge.
    <br>If you are such in heart, God will remove you in that statement.
    <br>Go ahead.
    <br>Yes, Sir. So, I believe that's why our brother is asking this question.
    <br>It's like we read the Word of God as history, but we don't see the Living Word work in our lives.
    <br>When we look at our lives today, honestly speaking, many of us don't make the Word of God work.
    <br>We are very good at reading the Bible
    <br>but we don't make it work.
    <br>For example, many will say, "Let there be light"
    <br>but where is the light?
    <br>We will say, "Be healed!"
    <br>but we don't see the healing.
    <br>We will say, "Be delivered!"
    <br>but we don't see the deliverance.
    <br>Why are you asking me this question?
    <br>Do you want to say something?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>The situation we find ourselves in today
    <br>calls for prophecy.
    <br>The Book of Proverbs says, "Where there is no vision, people perish."
    <br>But we are surprised that no one saw this.
    <br>If not the prophecy you said about the year 2020...
    <br>Who said?
    <br>Where God used you.
    <br>Oh yes, point of correction.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>When God said.
    <br>Yes, sir. If not the word of prophecy that God spoke through you about the year 2020,
    <br>when you said that sickness and disease
    <br>will surface this year
    <br>and this year will be the year of humility
    <br>and indeed today, it's a year of humility.
    <br>You want to say something?
    <br>Yes Sir.
    <br>We support the viewer that sent this question.
    <br>Ninety percent of the questions refer to this.
    <br>People begin to realize and ask, "Am I really a Christian?"
    <br>Why asking me this question? Is it because I'm coming from the mountain?
    <br>Yes, Sir. We support the viewers to ask this question because...
    <br>Okay, I know what to do next time. I will make sure that I'm coming from New York
    <br>so that you can ask me a different question.
    <br>How do we approach this question?
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Let's quickly look at a simple text here
    <br>from the Book of 2 Timothy 3:16.
    <br>"All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful
    <br>to teach us what is true
    <br>and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives.
    <br>It straightens us out and teaches us
    <br>to do what is right.
    <br>It is God's way of preparing us in every way,
    <br>fully equipped for every good thing God wants us to do."
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>First of all, we need to know what the Bible is, irrespective of the publisher.
    <br>We need to know what the Bible is - the Word of God.
    <br>The Bible is the Christian's guide for belief and practice and contains the truth of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Bible is the letter inspired by the Spirit.
    <br>When you are reading the Bible, God is reading you.
    <br>I mean, when you are reading the Bible,
    <br>you are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The holy men were carried along
    <br>as they spoke the message that came from God.
    <br>If you are to read the Bible, you must be carried along
    <br>by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>But nowadays, we read the Bible, we pray
    <br>without any attention to the Holy Spirit,
    <br>without any regard for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Before you read the Bible, you need to seek
    <br>the attention of the Holy Spirit
    <br>because the Bible is the tool in the hands
    <br>of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Without the handler, the tool is useless.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>We live in a world where there are two languages.
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>We live in a world where there are two languages: the language of the Bible and the language of today.
    <br>God uses the language of the Bible to create and save us, heal and bless us, judge and rule over us
    <br>but we use the language of today to gossip and tell stories,
    <br>give directions, to do business,
    <br>to do politics, to sing songs.
    <br>Whether you are a Christian or not, you can sing, "I'm trading my sorrows..."
    <br>It does not take anything.
    <br>And to talk to your children, "Get out of this place! Idiot!" That's the language of today.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Among other things.
    <br>Back to the question.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>If we take the Word to our heart
    <br>and truly make it part of us,
    <br>it will by its very nature change us from unsaved to saved.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>The Word of God is a treasure that produces great riches in the lives of those who meditate on it;
    <br>not in the lives of those who read it.
    <br>We can read and pray day and night but unless
    <br>we live in it, we miss the point.
    <br>A person has the power of speech
    <br>as the Book of 1 Timothy 4:1 says
    <br>and the Book of Acts 8:29.
    <br>A person has the power of speech
    <br>but the Holy Spirit speaks as He wills.
    <br>A person has the ability to decide.
    <br>"I know. Ok, let's go. It's ok. I need to go and rest."
    <br>I mean, exercise the will through the mind -
    <br>but the Holy Spirit has the power of choice.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>In Acts 16:6-7 and Romans 8:27, the Spirit has a mind
    <br>- the mind of the Spirit.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>A person has the ability to preach, to teach: "Jesus is Lord, Amen!"
    <br>A person has that power.
    <br>You have that power to teach, to preach, to pray but the Holy Spirit prays as He wills
    <br>as the Books of John 14:26 and 1 Corinthians 2:13 say.
    <br>A person has the ability to testify.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord. Amen."
    <br>"Jesus is Lord. My Redeemer,
    <br>my Saviour, my Healer."
    <br>Just name it.
    <br>You may know facts about Jesus,
    <br>ability to testify, ability to witness.
    <br>As John 15:26 says, the Holy Spirit testifies, witnesses.
    <br>A person can lead others but the Holy Spirit leads.
    <br>In the same Acts 16:6-7, the Holy Spirit leads.
    <br>Thank you very much, sir.
    <br>I believe that our viewers are so happy with these words of enlightenment that you have shared
    <br>and may God Almighty continue to increase your wisdom, sir.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Amen because I know you are happy we addressed the viewers.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>But sir, I have a question which I believe our viewers would also like to know.
    <br>Why does the Word of God impact only
    <br>the lives of those who meditate on it?
    <br>I mean, why the emphasis on meditation?
    <br>Meditation means to focus only
    <br>on one thing - God's Word.
    <br>One way one way
    <br>Only one way to Heaven
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>The Word of God can only become part of us
    <br>by meditation.
    <br>While meditating, we are on our own.
    <br>While reading, you can have
    <br>so many things on your mind.
    <br>Can you see why meditation is the tool?
    <br>While meditating, you are usually on your own.
    <br>While reading, you can have so many things
    <br>on your mind - distractive thoughts.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>"Yes, I'm coming!" - distractive thoughts; just think of what I'm talking about.
    <br>Meditation is a tool, a weapon to get
    <br>the Word of God into our heart.
    <br>This is where meditation comes in.
    <br>Bring this as prayer to God.
    <br>Ask God to speak to you through His Word.
    <br>While pondering over the Word, ask God
    <br>to speak to you through His Word.
    <br>While pondering over His Word, ask God to feed you in His Word, that you may know Him.
    <br>Ask God to fill you.
    <br>You come with your love;
    <br>you come with your fear.
    <br>Ask Him to fill you.
    <br>Ask Him to overwhelm you with His Glory, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Before Jesus fed the multitude,
    <br>He commanded them to sit down.
    <br>We need to ensure that our hearts are right with Him
    <br>while pondering over the Word of God, with no unconfessed sin.
    <br>As we read the Bible, God is reading us.
    <br>The greatest product of meditation is the fear of God and knowledge of God.
    <br>Don't forget, the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.
    <br>Meditation strengthens us to resist temptation.
    <br>David received much opposition in his life - both enemies without and enemies within.
    <br>He was the object of criticism and judgment.
    <br>Thank you, sir, for emphasizing so much the issue of meditation.
    <br>I know our viewers would still like to know more
    <br>because many of us find that we stop
    <br>at the level of reading the Bible.
    <br>What an encouragement to meditate!
    <br>It produces the fear of God and knowledge of God.
    <br>It helps us not to react to the flesh.
    <br>It prevents us from wrong reactions.
    <br>It causes us to respect the way of God.
    <br>Meditation always brings a response to God.
    <br>I mean, genuine meditation.
    <br>All real meditations will always bring a response to God.
    <br>That response may be confession, prayer, praise, thanksgiving - just name it.
    <br>The more the Word of God in us, the better equipped
    <br>we are to resist sin.
    <br>By meditation, we receive more from God, and God receives more from us.
    <br>Meditate day and night, as the Books of Joshua 1:8 and Mathew 24:35 say.
    <br>Meditate day and night.
    <br>What God has said to us does not disappear
    <br>but keeps returning.
    <br>Repeat what I said.
    <br>Meditate day and night.
    <br>What God has said to us does not disappear
    <br>but keeps returning.
    <br>Thank you for this wonderful message of wisdom.
    <br>Our viewers have really learnt a lot and we believe we will be hearing from them
    <br>on how this message has really impacted their lives.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
