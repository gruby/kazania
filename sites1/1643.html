    <br>FAITH IS NATURAL!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Let me wish you Happy New Year in advance!
    <br>Once again, Happy New Year!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Today, people manufacture faith; this is why it does not work.
    <br>People do what?
    <br>This is why you say, "I have faith. Why is this thing happening to me? Why all this?"
    <br>Because you manufacture your own.
    <br>People manufacture faith.
    <br>They say, "I'm born again. I'm this, I'm that."
    <br>Things are not working, the result of being born again, the dividend of all this is not there
    <br>because you manufacture them, fake them.
    <br>I think we have to talk about it.
    <br>FAITH IS NATURAL
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Just natural.
    <br>But today people manufacture - just like that.
    <br>So you know how you go about it - by emotion.
    <br>Before you know it, you start... you know how to go about it.
    <br>There is a sovereign power in that name, Jesus which cannot be imitated or faked.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"There is a sovereign power".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>In that what?
    <br>There is a sovereign power in that name, Jesus which cannot be imitated or faked.
    <br>If you try to fake it, the result is bad.
    <br>This is what we are seeing all over the world today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The result is bad.
    <br>Trying to fake, or trying to see vision, whereas God has not given you any vision -
    <br>the result is bad.
    <br>There is a wonderful name Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
    <br>There is a sovereign power in that name, Jesus which cannot be imitated or faked.
    <br>When you fake it, the repercussion is so bad.
    <br>You imitate faith in God - you see the results.
    <br>Those of you that manufacture faith, imitate faith,
    <br>"Praise the Lord. I prayed when I was about to sleep yesterday,
    <br>I turned to right, I turned to left, east, south, west and in fact I know it - this is billion dollars."
    <br>You now went home to do the same.
    <br>You turned to your right, to left, to east...
    <br>Do you know what will happen to you?
    <br>You will have "billion poverty".
    <br>Faith is not imitation.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the text in the Bible - that will really help you today.
    <br>We keep talking about this all the time.
    <br>Let's quickly look at Romans 10.
    <br>We can just take our reading from verse 9 there.
    <br>"If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,'
    <br>and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead...
    <br>For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified,
    <br>and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.
    <br>As the Scripture says, 'Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.' "
    <br>But today, many people claim to believe in Him but they are put to what?
    <br>A lot. Many of us here today are put to shame.
    <br>They claim to believe in Him but this is shame everywhere
    <br>because you manufacture your own faith.
    <br>Read that verse 11:
    <br>As the Scripture says, 'Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.' "
    <br>But what has happened today?
    <br>What has happened to you?
    <br>Because you manufacture your faith.
    <br>The Bible says, "Have faith in God. All things are possible. Have faith in God."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Have faith in God.
    <br>All things are possible.
    <br>That is God for you.
    <br>We manufacture faith today.
    <br>We make up faith.
    <br>Faith is not an intellectual creation but of the human spirit.
    <br>Committing to your memory, memorising the Bible and you begin to preach it, teach it,
    <br>to show that you are a pastor, believer.
    <br>You can defend Jesus.
    <br>You can say, "Jesus is this, that" because you commit this into your mental assent,
    <br>but of the human spirit, means of the human heart.
    <br>When He says, 'Believe in their heart,' He means our heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>This is what it means: Our heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>'Believe in their heart' - it means our heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>If your heart does not act upon the Word, nothing can be achieved.
    <br>When you say, "Jesus", without your heart acting upon the Word, you are calling your brother -
    <br>people bear the name 'Jesus' - you are calling yourself.
    <br>It is not Jesus in the power of the Holy Ghost if your heart is not acting upon the Word.
    <br>Your heart must act upon the Word to achieve the desire, the goal.
    <br>Our relationship with God always requires corresponding power.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Our relationship with God always requires corresponding power.]
    <br>Because God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>God's blessing always requires corresponding power.
    <br>"Be healed" requires what?
    <br>Corresponding power.
    <br>"Be delivered" requires what?
    <br>[Corresponding power.]
    <br>"Be blessed" requires what?
    <br>[Corresponding power.]
    <br>"Be saved" requires what?
    <br>[Corresponding power.]
    <br>"In Jesus' name" requires what?
    <br>[Corresponding power.]
    <br>What has happened today?
    <br>Because you hear somebody call the name "Jesus", you too, you are a Christian;
    <br>you call the name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You just hear the name "Jesus", like a baby you too say "Jesus" - no, not that Jesus.
    <br>The Jesus we are talking about - the One from above is above all -
    <br>requires corresponding power.
    <br>Can you see now; when you look at this, you will know you are not a Christian.
    <br>You manufacture what?
    <br>"Oh my God! I don't know."
    <br>Sometimes we do not know where to start with you; we are not even ABC.
    <br>Can we start learning how to crawl before you can begin to talk of ABC,
    <br>when it comes to the things of the spirit.
    <br>That is why the world at large is this.
    <br>A suggestion always comes to us from the Spirit that the action be performed.
    <br>"Walk!" - you must hear from there before you walk.
    <br>"Jesus" you must hear from there.
    <br>Every step, every moment intimation comes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>With the heart man believes that Jesus is righteous.
    <br>Not mouth - with the heart you believe Jesus is righteous.
    <br>With the heart you believe Jesus is the Healer.
    <br>With the heart you believe Jesus is the Deliverer.
    <br>With the heart you believe Jesus is the Saviour.
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>So this is what has happened; you manufacture faith.
    <br>"Heal me!" - and you cannot force Him, and you find that you are not healed.
    <br>"Bless me!" - but you find that you are not blessed.
    <br>If the Lord has not promised something and you are forcing yourself to believe,
    <br>you are not believing but dreaming.
    <br>This is what has happened to you because you manufacture your faith.
    <br>When you consider God more, you will not have to manufacture faith.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You" -
    <br>you have more of yourself that is why you manufacture faith.
    <br>If you have more of yourself, you cannot have more of God.
    <br>You have to have more of God.
    <br>FAITH IS NATURAL
    <br>We just need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>When we realise that God is reliable, God is faithful, our faith will simultaneously grow.
    <br>That is why you are here.
    <br>You don't mind who sits beside you, "Who is this? Is it my cleaner in my office?
    <br>Who is here? Who is this man? I don't know."
    <br>But out there you always mind who sits beside you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"When you realise that God is reliable, your faith will simultaneously - side by side - grow.
    <br>Look at who sits beside you.
    <br>Look around - you will see, "Who sits beside me".
    <br>You don't mind since morning but you mind out there
    <br>because everyone wants to sit with their "class".
    <br>The Spirit makes us to know that believing is possessing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The Spirit makes us to know that believing is possessing.]
    <br>But out there, the power, the energy, emotion, personality
    <br>makes you to know that believing is possessing.
    <br>But in the presence of God, the Sprit makes us to know that believing is possessing.
    <br>The instant, the moment you believe, you have.
    <br>OK, what are we saying?
    <br>We are saying you manufacture faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"I know Bible, I read Bible, I have been in the church for many years" - no.
    <br>"I have stopped smoking - what else again? I must have faith.
    <br>I have stopped lying - what else again? I must have faith."
    <br>That is how you got your faith.
    <br>Ask God to open your heart to His Spirit.
    <br>It is all about heart.
    <br>Right now: Open my heart to Your Spirit.
    <br>It is not...
    <br>Open my heart to Your Spirit.
    <br>It is a thing of the heart.
    <br>You have been a Christian, prayer warrior,
    <br>you are very smart in things of God.
    <br>In your village, in your community you have been fighting for Jesus - well done.
    <br>I say well done.
    <br>You have been fighting for Jesus, you are a Christian; everybody knows that.
    <br>Where is the dividend?
    <br>If today is your last day on earth, how do you know where you are going?
    <br>Let us follow the right path.
    <br>There is nothing "tradition" as it should be.
    <br>Don't let it surprise you that the person you have said so much about,
    <br>you don't know his mentor, where he comes from.
    <br>Theology college, certificate - nowhere; he is the one telling you this.
    <br>The same man that has no "theology", no seminar is telling you that:
    <br>Our relationship with God always requires corresponding power.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If not corresponding power, I would spend ten days in South Sudan; I would still be there.
    <br>But after I delivered the message,
    <br>the voice from Heaven said, "Right now, back to the airport."
    <br>I said to myself, "We don't have clearance to go today.
    <br>We need to do the paper work."
    <br>I called the pilot and said, "Look, the Lord said I should leave immediately".
    <br>The pilot started running to get the papers so that we can travel
    <br>and they were able to get this around 8 to 9,
    <br>and in South Sudan for many years there was no permission for anyone to fly out at night.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But I said to the president I had to leave.
    <br>The president said to me, "Leave? What happened?"
    <br>I said, "No. If I stay here more than necessary by the instruction given to me,
    <br>it will affect the assignment I came here for.
    <br>If I go beyond that assignment, it will nullify the whole thing."
    <br>The president said, "OK. Look for a permit. They should waive it - let him go".
    <br>We don't want anything to nullify...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"We don't want anything to nullify what you came here for."
    <br>I said, "It will nullify if I stay..."
    <br>The Lord said, "No!"
    <br>Then, I was standing all throughout because God said, "Don't sleep.
    <br>Deliver the message you are here to plant. The harvest is coming."
    <br>We don't plant and wait to see it grow.
    <br>The Lord said to me, "We don't plant and wait to see it grow. When you plant, you leave. Come back."
    <br>The Lord said to me, "Harvest is on the way".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So that is corresponding power.
    <br>Remember, you manufacture faith.
    <br>FAITH IS NATURAL
    <br>That is why the outcome is like this.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You manufacture faith.
    <br>That is why the outcome is like this."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, face your neighbour.
    <br>[You manufacture faith.
    <br>That is why the outcome is like this.]
    <br>All these titles you have,
    <br>deacon...
    <br>My name is T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You give me titles, prophet - there is no name you have not given me.
    <br>Over to you.
    <br>We should respect God and the things of God.
    <br>If you want to have a title in the world, it is different from a title from God.
    <br>We should not mix things and put a curse on ourselves.
    <br>Say, "Curse".
    <br>When we play a game, play it to the other side.
    <br>Don't play to God.
    <br>Faith is not a hobby.
    <br>But we have taken faith as a hobby, game now.
    <br>That is why you can bear any name, you can go for baptism twenty times.
    <br>You see it as a game.
    <br>It is a curse.
    <br>When there is no corresponding power, you are making a mockery of yourself.
    <br>Let's go back to the base, the foundation.
    <br>Who is God?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>That is the foundation.
    <br>If you know who God is, you will know how to relate with Him.
    <br>God is not a man that lies.
    <br>Let everyone lie and God what?
    <br>Looking around you, you get faith because you are a bishop.
    <br>Looking around you, you get faith because your father is a pastor.
    <br>Looking around you, you have faith because you are well educated, you can read the Bible.
    <br>Our relationship with God always requires corresponding power.
    <br>The One from above is above all.
    <br>He is meek, peaceable, humble and refrains from all impurities of the world.
    <br>Go over what I'm saying.
    <br>I'm giving you time to relax.
    <br>Think over what I'm talking about.
    <br>When you begin to reverence Him, the Bible says the Spirit will be released
    <br>to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"The Spirit will be released to the degree you stand in reverence of His Word."
    <br>When you honour His Word, the Spirit will be released
    <br>and you cannot do anything for God without the Spirit.
    <br>Take more of me, give me more of You.
    <br>More of Your faithfulness, more of Your kindness.
    <br>It's the Spirit you need because the Bible says the Spirit lightens the Word.
    <br>Let me show you what I'm talking about.
    <br>These are matches, this is the Word.
    <br>Can you see the Word?
    <br>The Spirit lightens the Word - say it.
    <br>Without the Spirit, the Word will remain idle.
    <br>The Word will remain inactive.
    <br>The Word will remain without being.
    <br>The Spirit lightens the Word.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>This is the Word.
    <br>If you now carry the Word because you know the Bible,
    <br>you can read the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation.
    <br>Many people say they finish the Bible every week.
    <br>In a year they can read the Bible four, seven times; I say, "Oh!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where do you get the Spirit to understand the Bible?
    <br>Without that Spirit, the Word is without being, life.
    <br>This is what the Bible means in John 6:63, 'The words I spoke to you are Spirit and life.'
    <br>The Word refreshes our mind and the Spirit renews our strength.
    <br>If not the Spirit of God, this church would have become a thing of the past,
    <br>but that Spirit is the One - a Defender.
