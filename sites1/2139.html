    <br>HOW TO GET GOD'S ATTENTION!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>I want you to take note:
    <br>What we give attracts people
    <br>but the manner and the way we give attracts God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>What I give
    <br>can attract people
    <br>but the manner and the way
    <br>I give
    <br>attracts God.
    <br>What I give can attract people but the manner and the way I give attracts God.
    <br>No matter what you give people will be there to see.
    <br>But the way and manner we give attracts God.
    <br>God is His Word.
    <br>What you give me can attract people.
    <br>People say, "Oh, he has given to T.B. Joshua. He has given this; he has given that".
    <br>But the way you give attracts God.
    <br>Anybody can give.
    <br>Criminals can give.
    <br>The devil can give.
    <br>Anybody can give.
    <br>The motive behind it ...
    <br>Anybody can give.
    <br>People are always looking at the way and manner to change.
    <br>Take note of the relationship between our possessions and our salvation.
    <br>"I am saved!". Saved? What do you mean by 'you are saved'?
    <br>How do you manage your possessions?
    <br>"I am saved! I am a born again!". Oh you are born again?
    <br>How do you manage your possessions?
    <br>"I have little" - That is the best time to give what our life depends on, with that little.
    <br>When you have much, it is always difficult to identify what to give,
    <br>because of our spirit.
    <br>And if you cannot part with little, you will not be able to part with much.
    <br>Therefore, there is no way you can give when you become big or have much
    <br>when you are not giving when you have little.
    <br>If you cannot manage little, you cannot manage much.
    <br>If you cannot identify what to give with little,
    <br>definitely, you will not be able to identify what to give when you have much.
    <br>Your time,
    <br>your strength,
    <br>your love.
    <br>The greatest temptation out there is poverty.
    <br>The greatest temptation out there is hardship.
    <br>It is the greatest temptation.
    <br>You have money and you are walking in the midst of poor people.
    <br>What do you want to use this money for that you are carrying?
    <br>People around you are so poor.
    <br>You are walking in their midst all the time and you are saved.
    <br>What you have in your pocket is telling you that you are not saved.
    <br>Little; you have little. What is the little you have? What is the meaning of 'little'?
    <br>Little. What is little? That is the best time to give.
    <br>That is when you can identify the right thing to give out of that little
    <br>because whatever you give out of little seems to be sacrifice.
    <br>And giving is sacrifice.
    <br>But giving today is no longer sacrifice because what you give is waste - what you do not need.
    <br>When you give them, you don't feel it; you don't know whether you give.
    <br>That is no longer sacrifice.
    <br>Everything about you is needed; someone is in need.
    <br>Your smile.
    <br>When I was coming this morning, I saw a gentleman.
    <br>We were trying to find the best way because we were in traffic.
    <br>When I looked at him through the window, I saw what he was wearing.
    <br>I decided to tell my driver, "Will you slow down? I want to know if this man is coming to church?".
    <br>We slowed down in the vehicle.
    <br>I told the usher, "I want to see how this man will enter the church",
    <br>because the attire I saw with him was not ok.
    <br>Why should you pretend? You don't want people to know whom you are.
    <br>You want to hide under what we call 'simplicity'.
    <br>That is not simplicity.
    <br>I am the one here who should not put on something that will cause discord.
    <br>I mean, people looking and saying, "Oh, this is beautiful". I don't want that.
    <br>I will look at myself and say,
    <br>"Let me see what I am wearing".
    <br>Is this too much for people to begin to look and say, "This dress - I must go and buy it. Look at the shoes",
    <br>instead of listening to my message.
    <br>"Oh, look at the way my pastor moves. Ok, this tie is gold" - it causes a distraction.
    <br>I must do every proper thing to get you saved.
    <br>HOW TO GET GOD'S ATTENTION!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>My message, my appearance, the way I look, the way I smile should not cause distraction.
    <br>If they cause distraction then I am working against myself.
    <br>To get you saved, you need the direction and the voice of God.
    <br>Let your neighbour at home know that you are coming to church,
    <br>not just that small Bible that you put inside your pocket.
    <br>You dress like you're going to work.
    <br>They do not know where you are going. "Is he going to a meeting? His appearance ...". They are confused.
    <br>Get strong. Let people know you are happy - from your appearance.
    <br>Don't let people say, "What is wrong with you?"
    <br>"I have no problem".
    <br>People are asking you because they consider your appearance, the way you look.
    <br>No. The Church starts from home, not here.
    <br>They think that I'm coming to church. Until I get to church, I behave like 'church'. I have 'church attributes'.
    <br>No. Right from your home, the Church starts.
    <br>Let someone say: Charity begins at home.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>God's character starts from home.
    <br>Good behaviour starts from home.
    <br>You know we are in a warfare.
    <br>Only the serious-minded will be victorious.
    <br>You want to tell me you are serious and you put on rags.
    <br>But when you leave here and you go to a club, it is a different thing entirely.
    <br>I encourage you.
    <br>Be happy.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Be happy.
    <br>You must tell the devil to leave; if not, he will not leave.
    <br>Tell the devil to leave, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>To say this, in the name of Jesus, you must believe with all your heart.
    <br>With all my heart.
    <br>Yes, new every morning.
    <br>I say, you devil, out of this body, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Devil, out of my life, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>This is as simple as a-b-c.
    <br>With all your heart.
    <br>You have been given instructions on how to keep your blessing.
    <br>How do we keep our blessing?
    <br>One of the key ways: What you give.
    <br>You keep giving but where is the reward?
    <br>If you really give something that attracts God's attention,
    <br>someone is somewhere waiting to give to you too.
    <br>What are you looking for?
    <br>Good health. Someone is somewhere waiting to give to you too.
    <br>Prosperity. Someone is somewhere waiting to give to you too.
    <br>Peace. Someone is somewhere waiting to give to you too.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you give something that pleases God, someone is waiting to give to you too.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If you give something that pleases God, someone is waiting to give to you too.
    <br>You have been giving - no doubt about that.
    <br>You have been giving but it seems that your giving attracts people, but not God.
    <br>HOW TO GET GOD'S ATTENTION!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>If you attract God and what you are giving pleases God,
    <br>you will want to give more because of the reward.
    <br>He is our Rewarder.
    <br>That is my life for you.
    <br>This morning, before coming into your midst, there is an exercise I must do.
    <br>I must make sure what I need to do.
    <br>I must play my role
    <br>because our willingness plus God's ability
    <br>makes us what we are as children of God.
    <br>Our genuine willingness plus God's ability works miracles.
    <br>You say that you have little.
    <br>Little. What is little?
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>If you don't start little, you cannot reach big.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Little.
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>If you don't start little, you cannot reach big.
    <br>HOW TO GET GOD'S ATTENTION!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>That is it.
    <br>You say, "I have little. It is only just the one that can take me to where I am going".
    <br>With that, take out of it.
    <br>'Trek' a little. You 'trek' because you have given something to someone out of the one you have.
    <br>That is sacrifice.
    <br>"I have little. If only I had I would help you, sir. But I have little".
    <br>Little. Everything big starts little.
    <br>For you to get big, you must start little.
    <br>If you are waiting to have big before you can give, that may never come.
    <br>Take your time to go to the bank to cash money and give to the needy.
    <br>Have you ever done that before? No.
    <br>Go to the bank.
    <br>While you are in the queue, say in your heart, "Lord Jesus, I am here for the needy; I am here to support the needy".
    <br>Now, it is not only money you want to give.
    <br>Even your effort, your time to be in the queue, is also what you are giving.
    <br>It is not that you will not be blessed if you are not giving.
    <br>People are blessed over there and they don't give,
    <br>but the repercussions there is that peace will be out of it;
    <br>peace of heart will be out of that.
    <br>If you have the whole world without the peace of heart ...
    <br>As I am talking, many are saying, "My friend is very rich, but he doesn't give".
    <br>Oh, your friend doesn't give?
    <br>Call your friend.
    <br>If your friend must be sincere with you, he will tell you what he going through in the dream.
    <br>He is being flogged. He is being ridden like a bicycle every day.
    <br>His days are numbered; their days are numbered.
    <br>Satan can just catch them unprepared. Just like that.
    <br>There is one thing that we miss and we lack. Not money.
    <br>No matter the little you have, if you have peace with it ...
    <br>You sleep, you will be content and you will grow.
    <br>Peace.
    <br>That is what we lack.
    <br>If you know this, you will not ask for more money or more possessions.
    <br>The one you have can grow naturally without even asking.
    <br>God knows. He knows.
    <br>He is the Giver.
    <br>How can you now tell the Giver, "What You are giving me is small. It is not enough"?
    <br>He knows.
    <br>Peace.
    <br>If there is any area satan affects in our lives, it is our peace.
    <br>Peace.
    <br>Peace of heart is what you need.
    <br>It is this peace of heart that gives all you need.
    <br>It gives money, it gives possessions, it gives everything you need.
    <br>But you don't know. You are now asking for possessions, instead of asking for the seed you can ...
    <br>Peace of heart.
    <br>That peace of heart is the Healer.
    <br>It is the Deliverer.
    <br>That is what we need.
    <br>If you are in a prison yard and you have peace of heart, it will become a sitting room.
    <br>I mean, you will just find yourself being happy.
    <br>But without peace of heart, there is nowhere you can be and be satisfied.
    <br>No matter the money, you cannot be satisfied; no matter what you have.
    <br>That Word is peace of heart - the Word of God.
    <br>Let us be serious.
    <br>Consider yourself as a blessed child for being here today,
    <br>for hearing this message.
