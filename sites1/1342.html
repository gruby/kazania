    <br>Let's pray for the viewers.
    <br>I release you from the pain of the past!
    <br>Be released from the pain of the past!
    <br>Pain of the past is the cause of unforgiveness.
    <br>It is the cause of bitterness, the cause of envy and jealousy, the cause of hatred.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every unclean spirit operating in your life, be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to release yourself, in the name of Jesus, by the authority given to you.
    <br>Every unclean spirit operating in your life, operating in your career, operating in your marriage.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>These unclean spirits are the cause of pressure and tension.
    <br>They are spirit beings that cause pressure and tension.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say to yourself, "I am released!"
    <br>Believe that!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[I am released!]
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I can't hear you.
    <br>[I am released!]
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I can't hear you.
    <br>[I am released!]
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being released!
    <br>Take it; believe it.
    <br>This is the Word of God.
    <br>I can see you being released!
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself, I see you being released!
    <br>I see it being broken!
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>to connect your business to himself, to connect your career to himself,
    <br>to connect your marriage to himself, to connect your health to himself,
    <br>I see it being broken!
    <br>Yes, I can see chains falling!
    <br>I can see them being broken!
    <br>Every chain satan might have used, I can see them being broken!
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used, I can see them being broken!
    <br>Confess this; confess your freedom now.
    <br>Chains have been broken!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
