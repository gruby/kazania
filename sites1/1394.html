  <p>    
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Happy Palm Sunday!"
    <br>Say to the viewers all over the world,
    <br>Happy Palm Sunday!
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes, we have just seen the little ones taking us into a historical moment.
    <br>You know the Bible says, in the Book of Psalm 8:2 that
    <br>'Out of the mouths of babes and nursing infants the Lord ordains His praise.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>May the name of the Lord be glorified, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!

    <br>Greet your neighbour say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Yes, 'Emmanuel' means God is with us.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Greet you neighbour say, "Happy Palm Sunday!"
    <br>Yes, as you all know, my name is Yinka.
    <br>A few hours ago I met with a lady crying.
    <br>I asked her, "Why are you crying?"
    <br>She said, "I just received a call that my father has just been rushed to the hospital."
    <br>And I said, "Is that why you were crying?" She said, "Yes".
    <br>I said, "Ah you know, this is a trap of satan to distract you."
    <br>No one is in charge of your happiness except you.
    <br>I said to her, "You just need the Word of God in the midst of your storms.
    <br>And it will make your way plain before you".
    <br>Not long afterwards, the same father called her to say,
    <br>he has just been discharged from the hospital hale and hearty.
    <br>This reminds me of what Prophet T.B. Joshua says that
    <br>we just need eyes that see, ears that hear what Jesus is telling us
    <br>through His Word and by His Spirit.
    <br>There is nothing that the devil may try to bring against you that can be greater than Jesus.
    <br>Today, I am here in the presence of God to share with you what I have received
    <br>from my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua -
    <br>the sweet story of our Lord Jesus and His power to save, His power to heal and His power to deliver.
    <br>The Book of Genesis 3:12 makes us to understand that the cost of obedience
    <br>is nothing to be compared with the cost of disobedience.
    <br>It would not have cost Adam and Eve anything to obey God's instruction
    <br>but you know it cost them everything to disobey God.
    <br>That is why Jesus Christ came to restore the fellowship and communion
    <br>which was broken by sin.
    <br>Once again, I greet you, Happy Palm Sunday, in the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>In Matthew 21, the Bible made us to understand that our Lord Jesus Christ gave an instruction
    <br>in righteousness and boldness to His disciples, an instruction in certainty, confidence.
    <br>What was the instruction?
    <br>'Go to the village ahead of you and you will find a tied donkey with a colt by her.
    <br>Untie them and bring them to Me.
    <br>If anyone says anything to you, tell them that the Lord needs them
    <br>and they will send them right away.'
    <br>The Bible says that our Lord Jesus Christ gave that instruction
    <br>and the disciples took that word without questions.
    <br>They believed and rested unconditionally and absolutely upon the Word
    <br>spoken by our Lord Jesus and they saw the invisible.
    <br>This means a man's will must be obedient to God's will before he can receive God's blessing.
    <br>Let Your will be done
    <br>Let Your will be done in my life
    <br>Let Your will be done
    <br>Let Your will be done in my life
    <br>Let Your will be done
    <br>Let Your will be done in my life
    <br>Not mine but Yours
    <br>Not mine but Yours in my life
    <br>Not mine but Yours
    <br>Not mine but Yours in my life
    <br>Not mine but Yours
    <br>Not mine but Yours in my life
    <br>Let Your will be done
    <br>Let Your will be done in my life
    <br>Not mine but Yours
    <br>Not mine but Yours in my life
    <br>Not mine but Yours
    <br>Not mine but Yours in my life
    <br>Let the will of God be done in our lives, in Jesus' name.
    <br>His Will will be done in your life today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Man is a free moral agent.
    <br>In other words, man can decide to yield  himself to God or the devil.
    <br>Whosoever you yield yourself to, that is whose servant you are.
    <br>Satan does not want any believer to live a life of faith,
    <br>let alone see the other side just like the young lady I was telling you about.
    <br>Satan does not want any believer to live a life of faith.
    <br>It is important for us to know, brethren, that there are two sides to life.
    <br>First, the spiritual side - the ultimate conclusion where satan was defeated for you and me.
    <br>And the natural side in which people try to figure God out with their natural mind.
    <br>A believer who walks in the natural, a believer who talks in the natural,
    <br>a believer who thinks in the natural is no match for satan.
    <br>The Bible says, a look of faith exposes what is hidden to the ordinary eyes.
    <br>Today many Christians react to feelings and they call it faith.
    <br>Feelings are influenced by what we see, what we hear, what we taste, what we smell
    <br>or what our circumstances look like.
    <br>These are sense knowledge.
    <br>If you base your faith today on what is seen or what your circumstances look like,
    <br>if you base your relationship with God on sense-knowledge, you can be a Christian
    <br>but a Christian controlled by satanic devices.
    <br>We need to be mature in order to understand the things of God.
    <br>If we are not mature, we react intellectually to the things of God.
    <br>So, if you want to fit into the divine arrangement today, you must change your thinking, your utterances,
    <br>the way you react to situations and what you give your attention to.
    <br>This will bring us to the message:
    <br>LIVING ABOVE THE SENSES TO CONQUER
    <br>Now we know what senses mean.
    <br>Many Christians walk by senses and we call it faith.
    <br>The battle we fight in our daily walk is with our senses.
    <br>We only want to believe what we see, we only want to believe what we touch,
    <br>we only fight the people we see.
    <br>To many 'Thomas Christians,' it may sound unrealistic to say, 'Thank You, Jesus'
    <br>even when there is nothing to be thankful about.
    <br>To many 'Thomas Christians', it may sound unrealistic to say,
    <br>'Thank You, Jesus, for blessing me',
    <br>even when there is no sign of that on the outside.
    <br>Nevertheless, Jesus said, 'Blessed are those who have not yet seen but believe'
    <br>for faith based on what is seen lacks the quality of being stable.
    <br>Right now, let's turn our Bibles to the Book of Mark 5; we take our proof text for this message.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Living above the senses to conquer".
    <br>"While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue's house who said,
    <br>'Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?'
    <br>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue,
    <br>'Do not be afraid; only believe.'
    <br>And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, James and John, the brother of James.
    <br>Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue
    <br>and saw a tumult and those who wept and wailed loudly.
    <br>When He came in, He said to them,' Why make this commotion and weep?
    <br>The child is not dead, but sleeping.'
    <br>And they ridiculed Him. But when He had pulled them all outside, He took the father
    <br>and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him and entered where the child was lying.
    <br>Then He took the child by the hand, and He said to her, 'Talitha, cumi,'
    <br>which is translated, 'Little girl, I say to you, arise.' "
    <br>Now let's quickly go back to verse 36 which is the main proof text for our message.
    <br>"As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue,
    <br>'Do not be afraid; only believe.' "
    <br>Now look straight at your neighbour and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>whatever situation you may be facing, do not be afraid; only believe".
    <br>Believing God is believing His Word.
    <br>Today many believe but lack the necessary faith to release the belief in their hearts.
    <br>We are in the presence of God.
    <br>There is no doubt we believe but we lack necessary faith to release the belief in our heart.
    <br>Many today are people of prayer but perhaps not people of faith.
    <br>You must realise that you must act faith.
    <br>We fail to realise that man is what he is by faith.
    <br>You are what you are by faith.
    <br>By an act of faith, you begin to think, talk not of your sin, your shortcoming
    <br>but of your righteousness in Christ Jesus.
    <br>In Acts 17:28, the Bible says, In Him we live, move and in Christ we have our being.
    <br>This means the righteousness that comes from God is based on faith.
    <br>When this kind of faith is directing our lives, we will no longer be ruled by our senses.
    <br>Remember, human knowledge oftentimes makes a mistaken judgement of character
    <br>but you know God only values faith and love rooted in the heart beyond human discernment.
    <br>There is power in your mouth;
    <br>the belief in your heart must be released by faith out of your mouth.
    <br>But one thing you must understand, brethren:
    <br>Each time you act on the Word of God, something enters your spirit,
    <br>something enters your heart that increases your assurance.
    <br>Faith lifts us above the realm of our own abilities
    <br>and makes God's possibilities available to us.
    <br>No matter the situation you may be facing, do not allow your emotions to blind your reason.
    <br>I don't know the situation you are facing.
    <br>Do not allow your situation to blind your reason.
    <br>Are you poor?
    <br>Or maybe you have received a medical report of your condition, written it is incurable.
    <br>Or you are going through a financial situation.
    <br>Perhaps you are losing your home, your family because of financial trouble.
    <br>I want you to know that Jesus understands your needs
    <br>and He will proportion the remedy to your malady.
    <br>Faith is not always asking for possible things but for the impossible.
    <br>We are in the presence of God to receive something we cannot do ourselves,
    <br>something beyond reason, something beyond sense-knowledge.
    <br>That is why faith is not a product of reasoning faculties but of the recreated Spirit.
    <br>Ask Naaman in the Book of 2 Kings 5 from verse 9 and he will tell you
    <br>that the way of obedience is the way of blessing,
    <br>the way of obedience is the way of redemption.
    <br>The Bible says, when Prophet Elisha instructed Naaman to go to the River Jordan to wash himself up
    <br>and he would be free from his leprosy - just a word was sent to Naaman.
    <br>And you know Naaman was overwhelmed by the senses and he said, "Me? River Jordan? Of all rivers?
    <br>Does it mean there is no better river in Syria - me, dirty river!
    <br>There is not even any other alternative but that stupid and dirty river!"
    <br>Naaman was looking at the situation from the outside but the Bible says,
    <br>the moment that he yielded to the instruction,
    <br>the moment he conceded to the instruction of Prophet Elisha,
    <br>he saw God's hands performing all things for him.
    <br>This means a humble, believing soul will take everything Jesus says and does in good faith
    <br>and put the best construction on it.
    <br>In the Book of John 11:39,
    <br>Martha was insensitive to the Spirit of God by looking at the situation of Lazarus from the outside.
    <br>'He has been dead for three days and by now he must be stinking,' she said.
    <br>However, Jesus looked beyond what was seen on the outside.
    <br>He looked beyond the dead body and He saw revival, renewal and redemption.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing, it may look bad
    <br>but I am telling you that behind your situation is revival, renewal and redemption,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Don't forget that God always rewards the obedient.
    <br>When you look at the case of Naaman, you will understand that
    <br>Naaman was a moment away from his blessing.
    <br>Just by an act of disobedience, he was a moment away from his healing
    <br>but the moment he obeyed the instruction in righteousness,
    <br>he saw God's hand performing all things for him.
    <br>This means God always rewards the obedient; He does not necessarily reward the smart people,
    <br>rich people, educated people but He rewards the obedient.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Earth has no sorrow that Heaven does not feel.
    <br>That you are in the presence of God means that your blessing, your deliverance are released.
    <br>It is no longer in the hands of God, it is released.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, that you are connected means that your blessing is released
    <br>but you need to live above the realm of your senses.
    <br>To activate God's blessing, you need faith in the Word of God.
    <br>Whatever you receive in the presence of God today, you need the Word of God
    <br>mixed with the Spirit of God to make you a new creation in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Therefore, if you truly believe, then your heart will be at rest.
    <br>If you truly believe, the peace that passes all understanding will fill your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Live above the senses to conquer".
    <br>Finally, brethren, let's turn our Bibles to 2 Corinthians 4:16.
    <br>"Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing,
    <br>yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.
    <br>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us
    <br>a far more exceeding and external weight of glory
    <br>while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at things which are not seen.
    <br>For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
    <br>We do not look at what is seen.
    <br>What is seen is our trouble, pain, present darkness
    <br>but what is unseen is the life which Christ Jesus has given us today.
    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Happy Palm Sunday!"
    <br>The Bible says that the Word of God carries us above the realm of our senses
    <br>into the very presence of God, giving us a right standing with God.
    <br>To realise our victory is all about who and what is ruling our world - our heart.
    <br>To realise your breakthrough, your deliverance today
    <br>is all about who and what is ruling your world.
    <br>If you are ruled by the Word of God, then you live above your senses.
    <br>All you need to do is to begin to feed yourself with the Word of God in your heart.
    <br>As you are listening to me, begin to feed yourself with the Word of God
    <br>and it will make your way plain before you.
    <br>On the outside, your situation may look so rough, very rough
    <br>but on the inside, you are more than a conqueror.
    <br>Remember, the disciples believed and followed our Lord Jesus Christ in righteousness
    <br>and that is why they were able to make impossibilities possible by untying the tied donkey.
    <br>Today, if you follow our Lord Jesus,
    <br>if you believe His Word and follow Him in righteousness,
    <br>the impossible in your life will be made possible, in Jesus' name.
    <br>If you follow our Lord Jesus in His Word, if you believe His Word,
    <br>the impossible in your life will be made possible, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Be it in your health, finances, career, destiny, family,
    <br>the impossible will become possible for you through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>Your trouble may be pointing you to death or destruction
    <br>but today in the name of Jesus Christ, God's Word is pointing you now to life.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need to acknowledge God.
    <br>The Bible says when we acknowledge God for what He has done for us, He will do it again.
    <br>If you believe He will do it again in your life today, say, 'Thank You, Jesus'.
    <br>Say, 'Thank You, Jesus!'
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, because I know You will do it again.
    <br>You know the Word of God has the ability to form, speed up, dispatch and make happen.
    <br>If you believe, it will happen to you today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>If you believe, it will happen in your life today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
