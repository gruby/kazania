  <p>    
    <br>We shall take our prayer today from the Book of Matthew 11:28.
    <br>Rise up; let's prepare. Be ready.
    <br>The Bible says, 'Come unto Me, all ye that labour...'.
    <br>Lord, we have come.
    <br>We are here again
    <br>Lord we are here again
    <br>Holy Ghost we are here again
    <br>We are here. We have come.
    <br>You said, 'Come, all ye that labour...'. Lord, we have come.
    <br>Say, " Lord, I have come. Deliver me, Lord".
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Deliver me, Lord]
    <br>Again
    <br>[Deliver me, Lord]
    <br>Again
    <br>[Deliver me, Lord]
    <br>Yes, deliver me, Lord!
    <br>And you shall be delivered from every shame, the evil spirit must have caused you.
    <br>You know the shame: sickness, disease, affliction, setback, unemployment,
    <br>rejection, nightmare, stagnation - these are the shame.
    <br>They say, "What happened to you?" - "Nothing happened to me."
    <br>Whereas something happened to you.
    <br>"Where are you living?" - "Oh, I'm living at so and so street."
    <br>Whereas he is not there. He's living in the village.
    <br>"Please uncle, I need help." - "I'll help you." - whereas you cannot help.
    <br>Today, you shall be delivered from every chain, the evil spirit has caused you.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered from every shame, the evil spirit has caused you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it your health - be free and be delivered!
    <br>Be it your career - be free and be delivered!
    <br>Be it your marriage, your family - be free  and be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>These are shame - shame in the family,
    <br>shame satan has caused you in your health, career, business, finances.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every reproach satan has caused you - be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I'm not here to counsel you; I'm here to give you what God has given me to give you.
    <br>Every reproach satan has caused you - be free and be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free and be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>We always remember what caused us good and what caused us pain in the morning and in the night.
    <br>Whatever chain, whatever medium satan might have been using to connect you to himself -
    <br>you know what it means?
    <br>He uses the chain of poverty, hardship, affliction, career failure.
    <br>Whatever medium, whatever chain satan might have been using to connect you to himself,
    <br>too connect your career to himself, to connect your business to himself,
    <br>to connect your health to himself, to connect your family to himself -
    <br>be disconnected!
    <br>Listen again.
    <br>These are the things he uses.
    <br>He uses pain, our weakness, affliction, sickness, career failure.
    <br>You begin to look at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>"I pray all the time. I go to church all the time. Look at what has happened to me. I don't know."
    <br>Whatever medium, whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>to connect your career, health, business, family, future - be disconnected!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, be disconnected! 
    <br>I command it to be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your heart will tell you that I am not counselling you;
    <br>I am telling you what God asked me to tell you.
    <br>And I will not leave you until you are disconnected.
    <br>I can hear chains breaking!
    <br>I can hear chains falling!
    <br>Chain of affliction - falling!
    <br>Chain of career failure - falling!
    <br>Say, "I can hear chains falling!"
    <br>I can hear chains falling!
    <br>I can hear chains breaking, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Yes, I can hear chains falling - chain of affliction!
    <br>I can hear chains breaking - chain of career failure!
    <br>I can hear chains breaking - chain of career affliction!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Yes, I can hear chains falling, chains breaking!
    <br>I can hear chains breaking!
    <br>I can hear the chain: chain of affliction, career failure, disease, sickness, setback!
    <br>I can hear chains falling!
    <br>I can hear chains breaking - chain of stagnation, nightmare, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can't hear you - in Jesus' name!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Don't forget those who are on the sickbed.
    <br>Be released from that bed of sickness!
    <br>Be released from that bed of affliction.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Be released from that bed of nightmare!
    <br>You are released!
    <br>There are many on the sickbed, in various hospitals, various homes.
    <br>When Jesus says yes, no one can say no.
    <br>I command you to be released from that bed of sickness!
    <br>I command you to be released from that bed of affliction!
    <br>I command you out to be released from that bed of disease, from that bed of nightmare!
    <br>You are released, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I can't hear your Amen!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua

    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>You have to give thanks to God for giving us the faith to believe that we are healed.
    <br>Open your lips and give thanks to God for giving you the faith to believe that you are healed,
    <br>for giving you the faith that you are blessed,
    <br>for giving you the faith that you are delivered.
    <br>Give thanks to God.

    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>Faith is not something that you can buy; it is a gift of God.
    <br>There is power in our mouth, the belief in our heart is released by faith.
    <br>It means faith is the key that releases the belief in our heart.
    <br>If not for faith, the belief in your heart will remain dormant.
    <br>Where is the belief? Where is your belief? They cannot see.
    <br>But faith is the key that opens the door of the belief in our heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There is power in our mouth;
    <br>the belief in our heart is released by faith out of our mouth".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now, give thanks to God for giving us the faith to believe that we are healed, blessed, saved.
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You have got it all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>There is light at the end of the tunnel.
    <br>There is light.
    <br>I want to rejoice with you.
    <br>I'm rejoicing with you!
    <br>The way out for you has come
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The way out for my career has come!"
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[The way out for my career has come!]
    <br>The way out for my health has come!
    <br>You can be sick now, but the way out for your health has come!
    <br>It means Someone is handling your case right now, in the person of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Holy Ghost!
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>You are complaining you don't have money.
    <br>When Someone is telling you, "Come and meet me, I will give you", and you trust the person
    <br>and you know the person is only going by His Word - what else? Testimony.
    <br>Share your testimony!
    <br>Share your testimony; Someone in the person of the Holy Ghost has promised to give you.
    <br>The Holy Ghost is not a man that lies.

    <br>How?
    <br>Live and let others live.
    <br>Tell your neighbour!
    <br>[Live and let others live.]
    <br>Instead of you to embarrass people, let them embarrass you.
    <br>Instead of you to cheat people, let them cheat you.
    <br>Instead of you to hate, let them hate you.
    <br>Live and let others live.
    <br>You have a cover, Jesus is your cover.
    <br>When Jesus covers you, who can be against you?
    <br>It is time now you should leave yourself for prayer.
    <br>Leave yourself for prayer.
    <br>Hallelujah! I can't hear you!
    <br>Thank you.
