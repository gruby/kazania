    <br>Greetings From Barranquilla, Colombia
    <br>Emmanuel TV viewers, we are here at Barranquilla, Colombia,
    <br>the 'Golden Gate' of our nation.
    <br>We can see the development of this beautiful city since 2007 when the Mayor of Barranquilla City,
    <br>Dr Juan García gave us the key of the city and we immediately gave it to Jesus Christ.
    <br>God has done extraordinary things here.
    <br>I went to Lagos, Nigeria, and gave the key of the city to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Since then, the city has changed because of the prayer of the prophet.
    <br>Although it was the fourth most important city in the country, this city was not developing.
    <br>We have seen the manifestation of God's power.
    <br>Barranquilla has changed in every aspect - socially and physically.
    <br>There has been great investment and refurbishment of the sports centres.
    <br>Highways and buildings were constructed.
    <br>A 12,000 capacity conference centre was built.
    <br>God has worked through the Mayors of this city after giving the key of the city to Jesus
    <br>and has done extraordinary things in Barranquilla, the 'Golden Gate' of Colombia.
    <br>We want to thank God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>because since we gave the key of the city to him, this city has experienced a supernatural change.
    <br>Despite all the challenges the country has faced, Barranquilla City has remained calm.
    <br>We give thanks to God for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Stay tuned to Emmanuel TV at home, at work, wherever you are and you will be blessed!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>I'm here with our big friend, Dr Juan García, former Mayor of Barranquilla, Colombia.
    <br>He is the man that God used to give the key of the city of Barranquilla to God.
    <br>The key of the city was not only given for four days but for a hundred years.
    <br>When Dr Juan García took over as mayor of the city, the first thing he thought of
    <br>was to give the key of the city to Jesus Christ.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Thank you for this invitation.
    <br>We extend our greetings to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I had the blessing to personally meet Prophet T.B. Joshua in Cali, Colombia.
    <br>I extend my warm greetings to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I still have the gift he gave me.
    <br>It wasn't an easy assignment - I was appointed as Mayor of Barranquilla in December, 2006,
    <br>when the city was facing a difficult time.
    <br>Then, we started to work and found that there had been many attempts to give the key of the city
    <br>to the church but they had not been approved.
    <br>Therefore, we decided that this decree would be one of the first decrees to be approved.
    <br>We approved it and immediately presented it to the church.
    <br>Today, we can see the impact of this, despite all the challenges the municipality was facing.
    <br>I want to tell people listening to us that only God made this possible.
    <br>This city is changing.
    <br>In 2007, the decree was signed and the key of the city was given to the church by the Mayor,
    <br>just as it was in the Bible when the kings and governors came
    <br>to the priests and prophets, seeking guidance.
    <br>Afterwards, I thought everything in our city would start changing
    <br>until I realised that God uses higher authorities and I decided to visit Nigeria.
    <br>I met Prophet T.B. Joshua and gave him the key of the city and asked him to pray for our city.
    <br>Subsequently, everything changed when Prophet T.B. Joshua started praying for our city.
    <br>We have seen great changes in our infrastructure such as bridges, highways and the seafront -
    <br>to God be the glory!
    <br>We want to encourage all the viewers of Emmanuel TV and pastors around the world
    <br>that despite the challenges, you should give the key of your city to Jesus,
    <br>by taking it to a higher authority that is being mightily used by God.
    <br>It has been a great blessing for us and I invite all pastors to look for the key of their city.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, we want to honour and bless your life and ministry for your commitment.
    <br>We know that you are always praying for us and the city of Barranquilla.
    <br>We are so grateful to the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria and Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Prophet, I extend my greetings to you.
    <br>I had the opportunity to meet you in Cali.
    <br>I believe not everyone has the grace to be as close to you as we were
    <br>during that five minutes, where you mentioned you will visit Barranquilla.
    <br>We kept that word and we are waiting for you.
    <br>We send a warm embrace to you and to all your international team.
    <br>We wait for you with open arms so you can see the city you prayed for.
    <br>I recognise that there are different levels in ministry
    <br>and acknowledge the superior spiritual authorities that God is using.
    <br>By the grace of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed and continues praying for us.
    <br>Prophet, we bless you, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit!
    <br>We invite you to come back to Colombia, especially Barranquilla, the 'Golden Gate.'
    <br>We bless you all!
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Good Morning, 2020!
