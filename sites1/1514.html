  <p>    
    <br>Let us look at those things that can be a hindrance,
    <br>a blockage, a barrier between you and salvation -
    <br>between you and God Himself.
    <br>What can be a barrier between me and my salvation today?
    <br>You have received the message and with what you have seen -
    <br>the many deliverances and healings that have taken place -
    <br>what can be the barrier between you and your salvation?
    <br>Many of us will say, "I have received salvation today; I am free".
    <br>But check. You need to ask yourself some questions.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whom have you offended?
    <br>Who has offended you?
    <br>These are the two questions.
    <br>The way you treat that issue will determine what you are taking home.
    <br>Ask you neighbour:
    <br>Who has offended you?
    <br>Whom have you offended?
    <br>Who has offended you?
    <br>Whom have you offended?
    <br>The way you handle this matter determines what you are taking home.
    <br>And there is a huge blessing.
    <br>Look at your table - every essential of life is on the table before you.
    <br>Every essential of life - victory, salvation, healing, breakthrough, blessing, prosperity -
    <br>everything is on the table.
    <br>The Lord has set a table before you.
    <br>But the way you handle this matters.
    <br>Who has offended you?
    <br>Whom have you offended?
    <br>How you answer these questions, the way you handle it will determine what is on the table.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's take a look at this text:
    <br>We are taking our reading from the Book of Matthew 18:21-22.
    <br>And Colossians 3:13.
    <br>"Bear with each other and forgive one another if anyone of you has a grievance against someone.
    <br>Forgive as the Lord forgave you."
    <br>We say, "Give us this day our daily bread.
    <br>Forgive us as we forgive those who trespass against us".
    <br>This is what the Bible says. Take that verse 13.
    <br>Again I read.
    <br>"Bear with each other and forgive one another if anyone of you has a grievance against someone.
    <br>Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
    <br>And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity."
    <br>Take your time to read that verse 13; take it from 13 to the end.
    <br>And Matthew 18:21-22.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>So the question again:
    <br>Who has offended you and whom have you offended?
    <br>As a Christian, regardless of the circumstances - whether you are wrong or right,
    <br>whether you are the accuser or the accused, whether you are the offender or the offended,
    <br>in order to live in the freedom that God desires for you, you must forgive and let go of the offence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You must forgive and let go of the offence.
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>Regardless of the circumstances, whether you are right or wrong as a Christian,
    <br>whether you are the accuser or the accused,
    <br>whether you are the offender or the offended,
    <br>in order to live in the freedom that God desires for you, you must forgive and let go of the offence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I don't want you to lose the huge blessing you have received today.
    <br>People keep receive blessing; on getting back - no way because of our attitude.
    <br>You have a role to play.
    <br>Your genuine willingness plus God's ability work.
    <br>God simply commands us to forgive.
    <br>Forgiveness is not an option.
    <br>You either obey God by forgiving or disobey Him by refusing to forgive.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not an option.
    <br>"Ok. Well, it is over" - no, it is not an option.
    <br>So what are you taking home?
    <br>Already, God has given you the table full of joy, the essentials of life.
    <br>Where are you going without forgiveness?
    <br>Without forgiveness, it cannot be permanent.
    <br>People will see you this week, next week, this month - "Oh, beautiful!"
    <br>But the other week, the other month coming - "Ah, what is wrong again?
    <br>What is happening again? I thought everything was over."
    <br>As a result of unforgiveness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Forgiveness is not an option. God simply commands us to forgive".
    <br>I know what is wrong.
    <br>Do you want me to tell you what is wrong?
    <br>You are going by what you see, what you hear, what your circumstances look like.
    <br>"Look, this man slapped me. This woman embarrassed me. No, I will take him..."
    <br>You are going by what you see.
    <br>If you are led by your feelings, you will become ineffective for God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you are led by your feelings, you will become ineffective for God".
    <br>Do you know what I mean by feelings?
    <br>What you are seeing, what you hear, what you feel, circumstances around you.
    <br>When there is no money in your pocket - "Jesus, be cursed."
    <br>When there is money in your pocket, you will come to church, you will dress well.
    <br>When there is fuel in your car or your car engine is knocked, no church.
    <br>"No, we cannot go to church because our car engine is knocked, we can't come to church."
    <br>Who gave you the car? Who gave you the vehicle?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When there is food on the table - "Praise the Lord!"
    <br>When there is no food on the table...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I watched the manner people danced today.
    <br>You will see some people...
    <br>When you go to them, they will tell you, they have a testimony.
    <br>While some...
    <br>When you ask them, they say, they are jobless, they have no job.
    <br>We allow our feelings to control us.
    <br>And when you allow your feelings - how things are going, how you feel,
    <br>your circumstances around you to control you, you become ineffective for God,
    <br>a useless instrument.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Over to you.
    <br>You can know if you are going home with this huge blessing.
    <br>But right now, you can settle your account
    <br>by determining in your heart, "Look, let me give a call. Let me just settle it".
    <br>"Hello. How are you?" or send a text message, "We are praying for you".
    <br>You have the right, you deserve excellence but you are not excellent.
    <br>You want healing. What of the message?
    <br>What is much better - to receive or to maintain?
    <br>Look at the nation, look at the whole world today -
    <br>we lack maintenance; that is why we are suffering.
    <br>You have received a lot of blessings from God but you fail to maintain them.
    <br>Even your children at home.
    <br>God has given you those children but to maintain them...
    <br>We are talking of maintenance, you are talking of blessing.
    <br>We are telling you how you can maintain your life.
    <br>So when you get back home, what you need to do -
    <br>the reason why you have not been enjoying this dividend of Christianity -
    <br>we are asking you these two questions, how you can handle them:
    <br>Who has offended you
    <br>Whom have you offended?
    <br>How do you handle this matter?
    <br>These are the reasons the blessings you receive every day from God are being robbed.
    <br>During the prayer we can have this solved.
    <br>Ok, we are just trying to chat now.
    <br>The person talking to you now is Mr T.B. Joshua, the prophet will take over immediately.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's rise up for prayer.
    <br>Our heart is the communication point.
    <br>Say to yourself, "My heart is the communication point, I mean, the contact point".

    <br>Begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Every damaged organ - begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You see a man, the ears have been deaf -
    <br>I call it deafness, right from birth -
    <br>today, he can hear.
    <br>So right now, listen to me:

    <br>Lord, come and intervene!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Right now, your journey back, righteous journey.
    <br>Ask God to strengthen you.
    <br>Lord, strengthen me!
    <br>Ask God to strengthen you.
    <br>Enablement!
    <br>Make me Your channel - Your channel of love where there is hate.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me Your channel -
    <br>Your channel of faithfulness where there is unfaithfulness,
    <br>Your channel of obedience where there is disobedience,
    <br>Your channel of humitility where there is pride,
    <br>Your channel of light where there is darkness.
    <br>Open your lips, ask God.
    <br>Your righteous journey.
    <br>Enable me Lord, in Jesus Christ's name!
