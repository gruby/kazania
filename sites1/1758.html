  <p>    
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We are here again.
    <br>Let's quickly refresh our spirits.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Viewers all over the world, let me talk to your spirit; let me talk to your heart.
    <br>Am I talking to your heart?
    <br>Are you sure?
    <br>I am looking at your heart - I can't see you.
    <br>Where are you?
    <br>I can't see you.
    <br>I'm only looking at your heart.
    <br>Let's quickly go to the Book of Ephesians 2 - let's look at verse 8 - just a sentence there.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith -
    <br>and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -
    <br>not by works, so that no one can boast."
    <br>Say with me, "... not by works, so that no one can boast."
    <br>You say you want to boast.
    <br>Are you telling me you want to boast?
    <br>The Bible says, "Not by works, so that no one can boast."
    <br>You are here today telling me, "I have stopped smoking, going to club house, night club.
    <br>I'm a Christian." - that is what you are here to tell me today.
    <br>"I was once a smoker. I have stopped smoking. I'm a Christian. I must get there today.
    <br>I'm a Christian. I know the Bible - every verse. I'm born-again."
    <br>How do you know you are born-again?
    <br>"I'm a Christian." - how do you know you are a Christian?
    <br>How do you know?
    <br>Tell me.
    <br>This is what the verse is saying here:
    <br>"Not by works, so that no one can boast.
    <br>For we are God's handiwork, created..."
    <br>You say, "Yes, I'm here today. I'm a Christian."
    <br>You ask anybody - "My name is Philip. I'm a Christian. I'm born-again.
    <br>I have been born-again for the past many years now." See you.
    <br>God Almighty wants to answer our prayer.
    <br>This is what I want you to know.
    <br>What do you hear from me?
    <br>Be personal.
    <br>God wants to answer my prayer.
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[God wants to answer my prayer.]
    <br>It is over to you.
    <br>Instead of telling God that He must give me this, He must give me that,
    <br>we must acknowledge that we have nothing.
    <br>All you are boasting of, "I'm a Christian, born-again. You must give me this, that.
    <br>I have stopped smoking, drinking, killing, destroying."
    <br>You should know!
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>No.
    <br>It is by grace.
    <br>The work of "stop killing", "stop stealing" is not your work but God's.
    <br>If you stop killing, it is not by your ability you stop it but God's.
    <br>"I stopped smoking, going to club house" - it is not your work, it is God's work.
    <br>You cannot stop that without God.
    <br>You cannot stop sinning without God.
    <br>You cannot stop lying without God.
    <br>It is not possible for you to stop stealing, destroying without God.
    <br>It can never be your decision but God's.
    <br>This is what the Bible is saying here.
    <br>Without God, it is not possible.
    <br>We must ask for God's mercy so that we will not receive the judgement we truly deserve.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me.
    <br>You must mean it.
    <br>Mean it!
    <br>Our relationship with God Almighty is founded, based upon His mercy.
    <br>Our relationship with Jesus is founded, based upon His mercy.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me.
    <br>You know where you are coming from.
    <br>You know the state of your heart.
    <br>Conflict: for - against,  "I'm not healed - I'm healed. Am I going to be healed today? I don't know."
    <br>There is a conflict between doubt and faith.
    <br>"Go!" - "Don't go!"
    <br>There is a battle between light and darkness;
    <br>the state of your mind, the state of your heart...
    <br>Your heart must be at its best for God.
    <br>You can tell me that your heart is at best for God.
    <br>You know the relationship you keep.
    <br>You know the kind of job you are doing.
    <br>You know where you are coming from.
    <br>If you climb this Mountain by yourself, you will receive nothing but ordinary tap water.
    <br>"I'm a Christian, born-again",  you are here with a big cross, a big Bible,
    <br>"My name is Bishop, Prophet T.B. Joshua", whatever name you call, you say you are here today...
    <br>Our relationship with God is based upon His mercy.
    <br>Have mercy on me.
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me.
    <br>Prayer is often a wonderful revealer of the heart.
    <br>So, we must approach God with humility -
    <br>a humble, dependent, I mean, unpretentious attitude of the heart.
    <br>You come here, you look like a Christian, you know the Bible from Genesis to Revelation,
    <br>you belong to this church, that church, you are a pastor, whatever name you call yourself.
    <br>Unpretentious attitude of the heart.
    <br>Approach God with a humble, dependent, unpretentious attitude of the heart.
    <br>- "Your name is what?"
    <br>- "My name is Chris, Bishop, this..."
    <br>"Yes! Jesus is Lord!" whereas in your heart is a different thing.
    <br>Prayer is often a wonderful revealer of the heart.
    <br>"Jesus!" - you are telling now what is in your heart.
    <br>"In Jesus' name!" - do you mean your heart is in Jesus' name?
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>We are here today; once again, let me remind you.
    <br>Don't forget where you are coming from.
    <br>It's not now that will give you what you are waiting for
    <br>but the life you have been living before coming here.
    <br>Where are you coming from?
    <br>What kind of relationship do you keep?
    <br>What kind of job are you doing?
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What is the state of your heart?"
    <br>Are you telling me your heart is at its best for God?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>[Are you telling me your heart is at its best for God?]
    <br>You have so much that clouds you:
    <br>Your situation clouds you; your challenges cloud you.
    <br>You cannot see beyond your challenges.
    <br>All you are thinking about is, "Will I get healed? Will I be blessed today?
    <br>Will the debt be paid when I get to the Mountain?"
    <br>Your situation has become your god.
    <br>You can't see beyond your situation.
    <br>You can't see beyond your challenges.
    <br>The Bible says leave if for God; don't worry yourself.
    <br>But you never leave the situation for God.
    <br>You keep pondering, thinking, worrying, burdening yourself over and over.
    <br>Because of this, you can attend twenty churches.
    <br>You attended a different church yesterday, last Sunday another church.
    <br>Anywhere you hear good news - you run.
    <br>And church is the body of Christ.
    <br>What is going on?
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>Have mercy on me.
    <br>Ask God for mercy so that you will not receive the judgement you truly deserve.
    <br>What is the judgement you truly deserve?
    <br>Going there and getting ordinary tap water - that is the judgement you truly deserve
    <br>because you don't deserve what is there.
    <br>Have mercy on me, Son of David; let Your mercy and let Your favour speak for me.
    <br>If you mean it, this can be a soul-saving, a life-changing prayer.
    <br>Will you rise up and say to the Lord...
    <br>Let someone say, "Mercy!"
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Let someone say, "Mercy!"
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Mercy!]
    <br>Let someone say, "Mercy!"
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me.
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me; let Your favour speak for me.
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>If you mean it, this can be a soul-saving, a life-changing prayer.
    <br>Mean it!
    <br>Mean it with all your heart: Have mercy on me!
    <br>"I'm a Christian, Bishop. I have stopped smoking, drinking, this, that..." -
    <br>it is never your work but God's work.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Mean it with all your heart.
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>No turning back
    <br>Mean it.
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>No turning back
    <br>Have mercy on me.
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me; let Your favour speak for me.
    <br>Mean it!
    <br>Mean it with all your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>With all your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
