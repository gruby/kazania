    <br>Honduras Isolation Centre Interactive Prayer Session - Testimony Time
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>My name is Hermelindo from Honduras.
    <br>By the grace of God, today I have been discharged from hospital.
    <br>The prayer we received was crucial.
    <br>The Bible says we should believe in God's prophets and we will be prosperous.
    <br>Believe in God and you will be saved.
    <br>Here I am, a living proof that God still works miracles and that God uses His servants as channels of blessing.
    <br>Blessings to you, Prophet T.B. Joshua!
    <br>I have a new opportunity to live - I came back to life!
    <br>I was in isolation with terrible symptoms
    <br>but knowing that God has given me a new opportunity is a great blessing!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for your prayer!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for the greatest sacrifice of going to the Cross for our salvation!
    <br>My name is Francisco from Honduras.
    <br>How are you today after being discharged from hospital?
    <br>I am happy. God has been so good to me.
    <br>Since the prophet prayed for me, I have had joy in my heart.
    <br>Before, I was also having a lot of pain in my foot.
    <br>When the prophet prayed for me, I sensed fire all over my foot and I was healed.
    <br>The fire I sensed was the power of God.
    <br>The numbness and pain in my foot disappeared. Glory to God!
    <br>From now on, I am going to be connected to Emmanuel TV every day.
    <br>What is your advice for people with COVID-19?
    <br>They should believe in God and seek Him in truth, not only for a moment.
    <br>They should truly give God their heart, not only seek Him for healing but with sincerity of heart.
    <br>God is the only solution we have.
    <br>I am so thankful for my healing because I thought I was going to die.
    <br>But here I am today. I am going home in peace to continue my life.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet, for all your prayers!
    <br>May God bless you and Emmanuel TV with more joy, wisdom and love.

    <br>My name is Ariel from Honduras.
    <br>I am in the Regional Hospital in Honduras.
    <br>I want to testify about the power of God and what happened during the prayer session with T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Eleven patients that were in the COVID-19 isolation centre have been discharged.
    <br>Members of the medical staff were amazed after witnessing the miraculous recovery
    <br>of the patients after the prayer with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We are grateful for the prayer session that took place here.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for remembering Honduras!
    <br>Thank you for remembering the Honduran people.
    <br>We have witnessed how the patients were discharged.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for Your wonderful work in Honduras!
    <br>I am one of the nurses who have been caring for patients at the hospital.
    <br>The response I saw from the patients after the prayer was very positive.
    <br>When the prophet started praying for them, all of us were so happy because they are like our family.
    <br>I noticed that one of the patients started shaking when the prayer began.
    <br>She participated fervently in the prayer and then she vomited.
    <br>I witnessed another patient's testimony when he said, "I'm healed!I was touched by the Holy Spirit!
    <br>That prayer was for me. I'm healed now!"
    <br>The proof that he was healed was that the next day this patient was discharged.
    <br>Indeed, he was completely healed.
    <br>The next day I asked another patient who was in a very bad condition, "Where is your oxygen mask?"
    <br>She replied, "I don't need it anymore; it has been removed and tomorrow I'm going back home!"
    <br>That is the evidence of the prayer through the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>I thank God for sending people like you to help our patients and the medical staff.
    <br>God is love and that is why all this has come to pass.
    <br>I bless the Lord for performing so many wonders in the lives of our patients.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We pray God will continue to bless you and that your mission will continue to grow.
    <br>During the prayer, I saw some of the patients stand up
    <br>while others vomited or went to the toilet. They were set free!
    <br>I witnessed the miracles take place during the prayer.
    <br>My father was among the patients that received prayer and were set free.
    <br>I saw him before the prayer but after the prayer he was so well!
    <br>My father and all the other patients were so happy after the prayer.
    <br>He had lost his appetite but after the prayer he was able to eat.
    <br>I thank God and Prophet T.B. Joshua for Emmanuel TV because through it
    <br>the patients were able to receive the prayer and they were set free and discharged.
    <br>My father has completely recovered and tomorrow he will go back home.
    <br>Thank God for Emmanuel TV!
    <br>My name is Karla.
    <br>I'm an assistant nurse at this hospital in Honduras. I'm very proud to work here.
    <br>The experience I had during the prayer is that I saw miracles -
    <br>miracles that only our Heavenly Father can perform through His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I am very happy and grateful to the Lord for the Emmanuel TV Team
    <br>who are helping people with the terrible sickness of COVID-19.
    <br>We believe in the Lord; we believe there's nothing impossible for Him.
    <br>I bless Prophet T.B. Joshua and his team for coming to pray for our patients.
    <br>I have seen the changes in the patients.
    <br>I'm filled with joy that God has sent His servant to this place to help us.
    <br>As health workers we do what we can - give medication to the patients and care for them.
    <br>But there are some things that only God can do through His servants.
    <br>I'm grateful to God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and his team.
    <br>I've seen the changes in the patients; even one of my relatives is in the COVID-19 unit.
    <br>Before the prayer, she was positive and had pneumonia but God has healed her
    <br>and performed a miracle in her life.
    <br>She was seriously affected but after the prayer I visited her and asked her, "How do you feel?"
    <br>She replied, "I'm healed; I'm not using the oxygen mask anymore."
    <br>I was so happy when I saw her and the other patients that were so excited.
    <br>They were without their oxygen masks and sleeping well.
    <br>I thank God and Prophet T.B. Joshua! May God bless you always!
    <br>My name is Jerónimo from Honduras.
    <br>I want to testify that I was part of this project of the prayer with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for the COVID-19 patients in this hospital.
    <br>I thank Jesus and the Emmanuel TV Team.
    <br>God bless you!
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>My name is Jorge Arévalo and I'm a pastor here in Honduras, Central America.
    <br>On this occasion I want to thank God because by His wonderful grace
    <br>we had the privilege to celebrate a Distance Is Not A Barrier Interactive Prayer Session
    <br>at one of our hospitals in Honduras.
    <br>During the preparation process, it seemed like 'all hell broke loose'.
    <br>There was a lot of opposition and we have learned from Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>that anything close to Jesus will receive attack.
    <br>So, we can grow in faith and character in the midst of the challenges.
    <br>We want to thank the SCOAN Team for their awesome job of communication and coordination.
    <br>We want to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua because after that powerful prayer,
    <br>all Heaven manifested in that hospital for salvation, deliverance and healing.
    <br>We want to thank God because He located our people in Honduras.
    <br>We can surely say, "Emmanuel - God with us!"
    <br>We at Emmanuel TV would like to take this time to appreciate all the medical and administrative staff
    <br>of this isolation centre in Honduras
    <br>and all those who came together to make the Interactive Prayer Session possible.
    <br>As T.B. Joshua says, "What you make happen for others, God will make happen for you."
