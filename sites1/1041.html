  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever medium you are using to view us,
    <br>you are with us and we are with you.
    <br>This is the moment of salvation,
    <br>moment of healing,
    <br>moment of deliverance,
    <br>moment of breakthrough.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Remember, at this moment, you have been forgiven of all your sins
    <br>and if the Son forgives you, you are delivered.
    <br>Say to yourself, "If the Son forgives me, I'm delivered".
    <br>Be delivered in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself -
    <br>these are the instruments satan uses to connect us to himself:
    <br>sickness, hardship, depression - whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>open you lips, by the power of resurrection -
    <br>that good health that has been taken from you,
    <br>that promotion that has been taken from you,
    <br>your destined position that has been taken from you,
    <br>your destined marriage that has been taken from you,
    <br>be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>By the power of resurrection, be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I command every sick organ, be it your kidneys, liver, blood, bones, fluids
    <br>be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Power of the Holy Ghost!
    <br>Holy Ghost!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Right now, begin to disconnect your business from anything that has to do with demons, satan.
    <br>Disconnect your business from failure.
    <br>Disconnect your business from backwardness..
    <br>Disconnect your marriage from backwardness, setback.
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Jesus has made you whole; give thanks to Him.
    <br>He made you fit for healing, deliverance, blessing.
    <br>He made you fit for God Almighty.
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Happy Easter!
