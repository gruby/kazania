  <p>    
    <br>I can hear chains falling - chains of affliction.
    <br>Satan uses these chains to connect affliction to people - to himself.
    <br>That is an instrument;
    <br>he uses chains to connect people and that affliction in you is what he is going to use
    <br>as a chain to connect you to himself.
    <br>But, in this case - I can hear chains falling!
    <br>These are his weapons: affliction, poverty, hardship, setback, rejection, challenges.
    <br>These are his instruments; these are things he manufactures, and he is using them.
    <br>When he sees people happy, with your handset, internet, you suddenly receive a phone call.
    <br>"Hello."
    <br>The news you hear there can change your heart again.
    <br>Before you know it, you begin to be unhappy.
    <br>That is the work of satan.
    <br>He is now using technology to get people.
    <br>When you are stable, suddenly, you will receive a phone call, a text message,
    <br>just to make you unhappy.
    <br>The state of your heart matters.
    <br>The state of my heart matters.
    <br>If the state of your heart is at its best – here is Jesus.
    <br>If the state of my heart is at its best – here is Jesus.
    <br>Now, you can bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>You can say, "In the name of Jesus!“ and Jesus will come, if the state of your heart is at its best
    <br>because the Bible says, "Only faith pleases God“.
    <br>If only faith pleases God, what is the contact point of faith? Our heart.
    <br>Our heart is of faith. Our heart means spirit.
    <br>Our heart is the prayer room; our heart is the temple of God.
    <br>Today, our heart has become a conflict room between flesh and spirit,
    <br>a conflict room between for and against,
    <br>a conflict room between good and bad,
    <br>a conflict room between humility and pride
    <br>and a battleground between good and bad.
    <br>If your heart is at its best – here is Jesus.
    <br>You can bring Jesus to the scene; you can say, "In the name of Jesus“
    <br>and here is Jesus on the scene.
    <br>It is simple to know if you are praying.
    <br>It is simple to know if I am praying.
    <br>You can know if you are praying.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>You can know if you are praying.
    <br>I can know if I am praying.
    <br>You are just deceiving yourself.
    <br>You will know if you are praying or talking to yourself.
    <br>How do we know?
    <br>We know by our heart, the state of our heart.
    <br>I can know if I am praying, and I can know if I am not praying.
    <br>So therefore, you can know.
    <br>But for you to say, you don’t know whether your prayer will be answered or not,
    <br>what kind of person are you?
    <br>Our heart is the landing place.
    <br>The state of our heart.
    <br>If our heart is at its best – that means, free spirit, free heart –
    <br>you can say, "Jesus“ - here is Jesus.
    <br>A free heart attracts Him.
    <br>Where you forget unforgiveness, forget everything behind you,
    <br>those who have offended you, those who have wronged you.
    <br>You leave all for God.
    <br>Then, you can come to God.
    <br>Can’t you hear what the Bible says: "Forgive us as we forgive those…“.
    <br>How do we forgive without a free heart?
    <br>Our Lord’s prayer says, "Forgive us, Lord, as we forgive those who sin against us“.
    <br>Is that not what the Bible says?
    <br>How can you forgive?
    <br>Brother, come here. How can you forgive without a free spirit?
    <br>Without a free spirit, you can’t forgive.
    <br>Without a free spirit – forget about the Holy Spirit yet.
    <br>Holy Spirit is too far. I’m talking to you now.
    <br>How can you now forgive without a free spirit?
    <br>I can’t forgive, sir.
    <br>That is all. It is not possible.
    <br>Because everything „Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit!“ – it is too far.
    <br>Talk to yourself, your heart.
    <br>You cannot forgive without a free heart.
    <br>Heart means our spirit. Our spirit means heart.
    <br>You cannot forgive.
    <br>"Forgive us, as we forgive those who sin against us“ – is that not the covenant we make?
    <br>Is that not your covenant? What is your covenant?
    <br>The greatest covenant we have made on earth as Christians:
    <br>We say to the Lord, "Forgive me, as I forgive those who sin against me“.
    <br>That is covenant but we have not fulfilled that covenant.
    <br>I will keep coming to church every day, keep praying to God.
    <br>That is the first covenant. The second covenant can follow.
    <br>The first covenant for Christians all over the world, to become a Christian:
    <br>"Forgive me, Lord, as I have forgiven those who have sinned against me".
    <br>Have you forgiven those who have sinned against you?
    <br>No.
    <br>That is why you are struggling, you don’t know whether your prayer is answered,
    <br>you don’t know whether you are praying to God.
    <br>There is no selection when it comes to forgiveness.
    <br>The wrong - the right.
    <br>Injustice - justice.
    <br>Forgive all.
    <br>Whether you are wrong or right, forgive.
    <br>Forgive us, as we forgive those who sin against us.
    <br>Say to yourself again.
    <br>Forgive us, as we forgive those who sin against us.
    <br>Is that not the covenant you have made?
    <br>Is that the first covenant?
    <br>That is the first covenant.
    <br>Before you come to God, that is the first.
    <br>When you open the Bible, the Lord’s prayer is the first to read.
    <br>But see what you are doing now.
    <br>You are a Christian today but yet, the first thing - one, two - you don’t know.
    <br>But you know 100, 1 million; you can count up to that.
    <br>Can somebody stand up there and tell me, what your duty now is.
    <br>Forgive me, as I forgive those who sin against me.
    <br>- What is your duty now?
    <br>- To forgive them.
    <br>- Who are the people?
    <br>- Anybody.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you, brother. My brother says, anybody.
    <br>My mummy, ok, come on.
    <br>My obligation is that I need to meditate on those words
    <br>and God will reveal more to me the people I need to forgive.
    <br>So what are the things you have promised initially as a Christian, before you became a Christian?
    <br>That I would forgive those who have trespassed against me, as Jesus has forgiven me.
    <br>Ok. What has been happening?
    <br>To be sincere, what has been happening?
    <br>I have been struggling to forgive.
    <br>Ok. Will Jesus struggle to bless you?
    <br>No.
    <br>That is it now. Jesus will struggle to bless you.
    <br>I will forgive now.
    <br>Help me, Jesus, so that I will forgive all those who have trespassed against me.
    <br>Why are you shaking now?
    <br>Your heart is troubled because of what?
    <br>Pain of the past.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She said her heart is shaking because of the pain of the past.
    <br>So you have seen now.
    <br>It is more painful to you than your enemy – unforgiveness;
    <br>it is more dangerous to you than your enemy.
    <br>Unforgiveness is more dangerous to me than my enemy.
    <br>Your enemy needs forgiveness for mercy
    <br>but you need forgiveness to [go to] Heaven, [for] eternal life.
    <br>Because if you die today without that forgiveness, you are going to hell.
    <br>You need it for eternal life but your enemy needs it for favour.
    <br>It is more dangerous to you.
    <br>So please, take care of yourself. Thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much.
