  <p>    
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>The title of our message: Don't Concentrate On Your Situation
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Don't concentrate on your situation.
    <br>What is your situation? That is the question.
    <br>Many Christians today cry, murmur and lament every day about their situations
    <br>because their lives are centred on how they are doing,
    <br>how they are feeling and how they are treated.
    <br>It is all about Jesus, not about us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Don't be ruled by your situation.
    <br>Don't be ruled by your situation.
    <br>Your situation could be sickness, poverty, hardship,
    <br>rejection, isolation or barrenness.
    <br>Don't be ruled by your situation.
    <br>The rich must not concentrate on their wealth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The rich must not concentrate on their wealth.
    <br>The poor should not concentrate on their poverty.
    <br>The sick should not concentrate on their sickness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again: Don't be ruled by your situation.
    <br>Let's take our reading from John 16 verse 33.
    <br>"These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace.
    <br>In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer,
    <br>I have overcome the world."
    <br>'Be of good cheer' means be happy. I have overcome disease and given you healing.
    <br>I have overcome poverty and given you blessing.
    <br>But why are you still worried?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask yourself: Why am I worried?
    <br>Why are you worried?
    <br>If you are with Him, you will enjoy the peace He is talking about.
    <br>Are you with Him? That is the question you need to ask yourself: Are you with Him?
    <br>He has conquered the world and given you victory. Are you one of the people?
    <br>No matter what you are passing through,
    <br>if you are with Him, you will enjoy peace.
    <br>What are you passing through?
    <br>No matter what you are passing through,
    <br>if allowed by God as a trial,
    <br>you must not think it strange and doubt your Guard.
    <br>His grace is sufficient for you - remember Paul.
    <br>What do I mean: You must not consider it unusual,
    <br>abnormal, odd and begin to doubt.
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a child of God,
    <br>and yet be a candidate of Heaven,
    <br>and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>DON’T CONCENTRATE ON YOUR SITUATION!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>While I was coming, I met a woman who was complaining.
    <br>I said, "Why are you crying?".
    <br>She said that she had been married for many years, without a child.
    <br>Difficulty in having the fruit of the womb for many years of the marriage,
    <br>in spite of prayers and visits to the doctor, can shake some people's faith
    <br>and question the truth of the Word
    <br>which says, "There should be no barrenness in the house".
    <br>Look at the Book of Deuteronomy 7 verse 14.
    <br>"You shall be blessed above all peoples;
    <br>there shall not be a male or female barren among you
    <br>or among your livestock."
    <br>DON’T CONCENTRATE ON YOUR SITUATION!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>When you look at Exodus 23 verse 26
    <br>and Isaiah 54 verse 1.
    <br>A woman can be barren and yet be a favourite, a candidate, a friend of God.
    <br>We should not because of our situation cut off our dependence on God.
    <br>What do I mean by 'dependence'?
    <br>Today, you no longer look to God when trouble comes,
    <br>when the goings are tough, as if we are not children of God.
    <br>Satisfaction in life is not about having children,
    <br>money or other worldly possessions.
    <br>DON’T CONCENTRATE ON YOUR SITUATION!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>You have to experience God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You have to experience God.
    <br>Until you experience God, there will be dissatisfaction -
    <br>a sense of hunger to know what life is all about,
    <br>a desire to know what happens after life is over - after death.
    <br>You have money - no peace.
    <br>Children,
    <br>education,
    <br>you travel all over the world,
    <br>you become a president of a nation - no peace.
    <br>There are many ex-presidents that cannot walk on the street. Why?
    <br>DON’T CONCENTRATE ON YOUR SITUATION!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>And they are supposed to be 'man of people'.
    <br>People will say, "Man of people".
    <br>Satan tempts us to put on a sensational display of power.
    <br>He frightens us by displaying fake power and causes people to panic.
    <br>The greatest thing satan aims at in tempting good people is to overthrow their position as children of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The greatest thing
    <br>satan aims at
    <br>in tempting good people
    <br>is to overthrow their position
    <br>as children of God.
    <br>1. Cut off their dependence on God.
    <br>2. Their duty to God.
    <br>3. Their communion with God.
    <br>These are the three aims.
    <br>DON’T CONCENTRATE ON YOUR SITUATION!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>The devil aims to shake our faith in the Word
    <br>and bring us to question the truth of the Word.
    <br>Is that true? I am sick, I am here.
    <br>Is that true? I am poor, I am here.
    <br>Is that true? I am in trouble. I am here.
    <br>DON’T CONCENTRATE ON YOUR SITUATION!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>If we receive so much comfort from God, shall we not receive some affliction,
    <br>pain, headache, temptation
    <br>which will serve as a check, as impediment to our comfort.
    <br>It is well with my soul.
    <br>Let's quickly go to the Book of John 14 verse 27.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you;
    <br>not as the world gives... Let not your heart be troubled."
    <br>The world gives peace but it is time bound, not for eternity.
    <br>The peace of God is for eternity.
    <br>Everything about it is good.
    <br>If your faith is lifted up, let me see you.
    <br>Don't concentrate on your situation.
    <br>Because a man can be sick in body and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If allowed by God as a trial,
    <br>you must not think it strange and doubt your Guard.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
