    <br>The voice of overcomers, "I am free!"
    <br>The voice of overcomers, "I am delivered!"
    <br>The voice of overcomers, "Defeat and failure are things of the past!"
    <br>Let me hear.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>If it is the same with you - defeat and failure are things of the past, let me see your act.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I recognise that. I believe that.
    <br>What of you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, your joy as overcomer is very important because I can see you succeed
    <br>- being healed, being delivered, being saved.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You are in the right time.
    <br>You know the power you are under? Ok.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You know the power you are under?
    <br>That is joy.
    <br>It is when you don't know where you are, you begin to say, "Ah, I don't know"
    <br>and you know God does as He  will.
    <br>Her fibroid came out. You that have fibroid, you may suddenly get home,
    <br>by the time you are sleeping in the night, fibroid on the bed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Because you have been set aside.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I have been set aside for the Lord's attention".
    <br>Did you listen to me?
    <br>Your coming here is to set you aside for the Lord's attention.
    <br>Say, "Attention!"
    <br>Say, "I have been set aside for the Lord's attention".
    <br>So attention means, the Lord is on the way.
    <br>What you are here for today may not be the right time
    <br>but when it is the right time, it will come because you are set aside.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You know, in many hospitals where they have a lot of patients,
    <br>when it is your time the doctor is about to attend to you, they will call you and give you a date.
    <br>When it is your date, it is your date.
    <br>Now, you have been set aside.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I have been set aside by Cherubim!"
    <br>Cherubim - they have set you aside for Jesus' attention.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>So, since you have been set aside, I have to withdraw.
    <br>So this is what you are praying for -
    <br>that is, "Lord, here are your children".
    <br>And the Lord said, "Ok, wait".
    <br>At the right time, He wants to give you now.
    <br>If you know you have been set aside, let me see.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>So take your pen when you leave here and write it down
    <br>that I have been set aside for the Lord's attention.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>So I am withdrawing. I am called to pray for you.
    <br>Now since you have been set aside, the case is not with me again.
    <br>God is on top.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Forever Oh Lord
    <br>Your Word is Settled
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>Forever Oh Lord
    <br>Your Word is Settled
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You know the meaning of being set aside -
    <br>you will hear rain coming, you will be hearing the sound
    <br>and the weather will change, it is about to rain.
    <br>It means, God has released that rain.
    <br>Now it is coming,
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Do you believe that? Take your pen and write down
    <br>that T.B. Joshua said, I have been set aside for the Lord's attention.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Right now, your country, your nation.
    <br>Whatever you have as a contact; if you don't have any, you and your nation are one.
    <br>Open your lips and pray for your nation.
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>We pray for our nations.
    <br>Lord Jesus, help our nations - peace and tranquility, in Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>In every area of your nation, we need God's intervention -
    <br>economic, social - Lord, we need your intervention.
    <br>Peace - we need God's intervention.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Give thanks to God for God's intervention.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Right now, for those of us that are just coming to Christ
    <br>and those who come to rededicate themselves,
    <br>let us open our lips and call His Majesty,
    <br>Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into our heart.
    <br>It is when Jesus is in our heart, we can have permanent peace.
    <br>There is no other peace. It is when Jesus comes into our heart, the Holy Spirit dwells.
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into our heart; wash us with Your precious blood.
    <br>Lord Jesus, save our souls.
    <br>Make us Your channel - Your channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>You know, as we are going, we are going back to the world, where there is darkness everywhere.
    <br>When you are a channel of shining light, a channel of Jesus, He gives light.
    <br>Make us a channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make us Your channel of love where there is hate.
    <br>Out there, hate everywhere, hate.
    <br>But when you are a channel of Jesus, channel of love,
    <br>you will redeem many places.
    <br>Lord, make us Your channel of love where there is hate.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make us Your channel of pardon where there is injury.
    <br>You know there is misrule, injustice everywhere.
    <br>As you are here today, once you leave here, out there, oh my God, misrule, misjudge everywhere.
    <br>The Lord wants to make you His channel of pardon;
    <br>you have the ability to pardon where there is injury.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make us Your channel of forgiveness where there is sin.
    <br>Everywhere, we are in the world but we are not part of the world.
    <br>Sin everywhere.
    <br>But when you are a channel of forgiveness, you have the ability.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make us a channel of forgiveness where there is sin.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make us Your channel of faithfulness and obedience, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>I can't hear your amen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Do you know what it means to be a channel of God?
    <br>Say, "I am a channel of God".
    <br>God has no mouth but our mouths to tell people how He died and rose.
    <br>He has no tongue but our tongues to speak for Him.
    <br>He has no hands  but our hands.
    <br>So now you are a channel of God.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>If you know you are a channel of God, I want to see you, let me see the channel of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>A channel of God -  you mean, you are channel of pardon.
    <br>Channel of God - you mean, you are a channel of forgiveness.
    <br>Channel of God - you are a channel of what? Channel of forgiveness. Wow!
    <br>I want to salute you!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>It shall be permanent.
    <br>So it means, as you are going now, you are ready to forgive,
    <br>you are ready to pardon, you are ready to love.
    <br>This is channel of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I pray this message will find a place in your heart.
