  <p>    
    <br>Today is Monday.
    <br>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - you are supposed to be in the office.
    <br>Tell me the report you gave them in the office.
    <br>Please tell me what you told your boss.
    <br>Your boss is watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>What did you tell your boss?
    <br>You are going for medical check-up?
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>What are you going to tell your boss tomorrow?
    <br>I believe 90% here did not even give any report.
    <br>They just decided not to go to work.
    <br>Right now, they are thinking, "What will I tell my boss tomorrow?
    <br>How will I put it?"
    <br>Don't ask such a prayer on the mountain that God should give you what to tell your boss.
    <br>God doesn't give that kind of...
    <br>Ok, tell me.
    <br>There is a woman there. She is just trying to hide from the camera.
    <br>She doesn't want them to know.
    <br>What did you tell your husband before coming here?
    <br>That you are going to the market?
    <br>Here is no market.
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>Let's quickly look at how we can encourage ourselves before going to the altar of God.
    <br>This is 'the mountain' we are about to go to. This is my own little cup.
    <br>Viewers at home, those of us that are under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>I want to tell you there is no difference between people here and you all over the world.
    <br>Distance cannot be a barrier.
    <br>When we are going to 'the mountain' to fetch our little water,
    <br>you too, take your water somewhere at home and stretch it towards the screen
    <br>and it will become that water on 'the mountain'.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Let me encourage you before we go to the altar.
    <br>I keep talking about challenges.
    <br>It is the hindrance, the greatest trouble we have - our situation.
    <br>For you to be sitting since morning - not that you like Jesus so much -
    <br>it is those challenges that handcuff you and the moment you are loosed - oh God!
    <br>Immediately you are loosed, delivered - oh my God, we start looking for you.
    <br>Compare yourself to Joseph in that Book of Genesis 37:1-end and Genesis 45:1-8.
    <br>Joseph was to be a blessing to his people.
    <br>The Bible says he had to taste hardship.
    <br>That is what you are going through today.
    <br>Joseph was to be a blessing to his people.
    <br>He had to taste hardship.
    <br>This means, if we have not tasted hardship,
    <br>we will not be able to manage blessing when it comes.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>If you have not tasted hardship, you will not be able to manage blessing when it comes.
    <br>Count persecution, humiliation, name-calling, slanderous remarks.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Some 8 to 10 years ago, if they greeted you, "Emmanuel",
    <br>you would look at the person greeting you before you say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>But today, everywhere, "Emmanuel"; everybody wants to say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Ten years ago, if you said, "T.B. Joshua" - "Which T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Let's discuss. The man is flying, has horns, the man this; go to that church,
    <br>look, you will not be able to come back home."
    <br>But today - "T.B. Joshua is my friend, he is my pastor. I know him."
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>If you have not tasted humiliation, persecution,
    <br>you will not be able to manage honour when it comes.
    <br>When you see people when the honour comes, you see the way they walk.
    <br>Honour dictates how to walk.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Some, when they are talking to you, at the pulpit, they say, "Amen".
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>They say, "Listen. Hallelujah".
    <br>If you have not tasted humiliation and persecution,
    <br>you will not be able to manage honour when it comes.
    <br>This is what you are going through.
    <br>You say, "I'm poor, I pray, my hardship is too much".
    <br>To mature you - is it a crime?
    <br>There is more knowledge in trials, there are more lessons in trials than in blessing itself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>There is more knowledge to learn, more blessing in trials.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>See what I have become now.
    <br>You have pushed me, there is nothing you have not done to me - thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>There is nothing I have not gone through.
    <br>What you are going through is to mature you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[What you are going through is to mature you.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[What you are going through is to mature you.]
    <br>It is to mature you.
    <br>There are more lessons to learn in situations, in challenges than in freedom.
    <br>There are more lessons to learn to mature you.
    <br>Sin easily hides where there is no heat of trial.
    <br>Where there is no sickness, persecution, humiliation, sin easily hides.
    <br>In times of prosperity and blessing, the wicked one seems kind and generous
    <br>but immediately the heat of trial and tribulation comes,
    <br>his wicked attitude, his wicked behaviours surface.
    <br>Christians, listen to me.
    <br>Trials, temptations, afflictions, sicknesses - just mention whatever you call them -
    <br>are meant to mature you.
    <br>They may be painful - indeed very painful - but they serve the purpose of cleansing.
    <br>That is why we are here today.
    <br>By the time you climb 'the mountain', you will become clean.
    <br>What carries you there?
    <br>Your challenges.
    <br>Your challenges, your situations may be very painful but they serve the purpose of cleansing.
    <br>That is why you are here.
    <br>By the time you climb 'the mountain' and come back, you become a different person.
    <br>What carries you there?
    <br>Your challenges, your situations.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>What many of us were supposed to go through in the past - sickness, disease, poverty, hardship -
    <br>is what you are going through now because you had someone there to help you.
    <br>You collect a bank loan, your brother, T.B. Joshua gave you money for business,
    <br>whoever gave you, whoever helped you for the work, business you are doing -
    <br>if all this is given to you to help you,
    <br>if all this is not sanctioned by God, it cannot help you;
    <br>rather, you run into another problem.
    <br>This is the case with us today.
    <br>This message will help you to see your situations, your challenges in a positive way.
    <br>See your challenges in a positive way.
    <br>Whenever you have problems, you start looking for witches and wizards.
    <br>Your mummy is doing things to you, "nobody is prospering in my home.
    <br>You see my car? Right now, it is a right-off.
    <br>My senior one in the past was also a right-off.
    <br>Now, this is problem in the house."
    <br>You start pointing an accuser finger at your mum and dad.
    <br>This is where you will start looking for an enemy.
    <br>You see it as a "hey!".
    <br>See your challenges, your situations in a positive way.
    <br>Problems become easier to handle when you know it will not last long.
    <br>Thank you.
