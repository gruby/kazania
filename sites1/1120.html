  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>There is one strange thing that keeps disturbing us on the social media concerncing
    <br>the Thailand football team with thirteen players who are trapped in a cave.
    <br>Please, raise up your voice. They are little children.
    <br>It disturbs the whole world. It has become worldwide.
    <br>Please, open your lips. Ask God to intervene and rescue these children.
    <br>Because every minute, the news about them is so frightening -
    <br>that they cannot carry them because there is too much water.
    <br>These children are crying; they are lamenting.
    <br>They cannot spend more than...
    <br>Please, open your lips and pray for God's intervention.
    <br>The divers and the people that want to rescue them -
    <br>God should inspire them what to do and how to do it.
    <br>There is nothing on this earth... With God, all things are possible.
    <br>Yes, the Lord should rescue these children -
    <br>rescue them, help them, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen!
