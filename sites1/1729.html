    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>I'm going there in regard to your spirit.
    <br>You will stay there, your spirit will enter.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Some spirits are here already.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>We have two Bibles here today.
    <br>This is a big one.
    <br>This is another one I placed here since morning because of you and I opened it down.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>When you come inside, I know you want to know the verse.
    <br>I will leave it for you.
    <br>I will not tell you.
    <br>When you come inside, you will look at the verse, you will know what I'm asking God for you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Have your seats.
    <br>I will not tell you; you will see it for yourselves.
    <br>I know that is where your heart is now.
    <br>You want to go and see?
    <br>Let me see where it is opened since morning.
    <br>Yes. What is that?
    <br>Don't look at this side, it is here.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>When I was coming, there was a lot of restriction, but I thank God I'm here.
    <br>"Man of God..."
    <br>When we are gripped by fear and panic,
    <br>you can imagine when we do not see beyond our challenges, situation.
    <br>You know the situation you are in.
    <br>When you do not see beyond them, you are gripped.
    <br>You see what is happening?
    <br>You are gripped.
    <br>Just look; one eye is here, one eye here.
    <br>You know how to do that kind of look.
    <br>Listen to me; this message is more important than what you are looking at.
    <br>This is a miracle but what I am saying will help you to maintain your miracle.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>I told you that many spirits are here already - there is one.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>I said I would open the door for your spirit to enter - this is one.
    <br>When we do not see beyond our situation, we are gripped by fear and panic,
    <br>"Ah, what is going to happen? Since morning I have been sitting down here.
    <br>I don't know whether my own will look like that lady that received her sight."
    <br>A lot of things keep going on.
    <br>I pray you will not be ignorant of your faith.
    <br>When we are ignorant of our faith, fear grips us.
    <br>Panic and fear - when you are ignorant of your faith.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's take a look at the Book of 2 Kings 6:15.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>you keep saying you miss me but I'm here again and again.
    <br>Are you still saying you miss me?
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>It is happening everywhere, right now to everyone who is under the influence of this programme.
    <br>Your affliction is bleeding!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My affliction is bleeding!"
    <br>My hardship is bleeding.
    <br>My poverty is bleeding.
    <br>Stagnation is bleeding.
    <br>Failure is bleeding.
    <br>Look at this one - it is bleeding.
    <br>Just suddenly...
    <br>She has been sitting since morning but why now?
    <br>Since morning, she has been sitting down there but why now instantly?
    <br>That is to show you the Holy Spirit is welcome.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Verse 15:
    <br>"When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning,
    <br>an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city.
    <br>'Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?' the servant asked.
    <br>'Don't be afraid,' the prophet answered.
    <br>'Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.' "
    <br>You can see now that those who are with you are more than the forces of the adversary.
    <br>You agree with me?
    <br>Before now you were afraid and you were gripped but now you have seen that there is a way out!
    <br>There is a way out!
    <br>When the servant of Elisha saw the chariots and instruments of war,
    <br>he ran to his master, "Master, these people are more than us."
    <br>And the master said to him, "Don't be afraid!"
    <br>This is what I'm saying here now.
    <br>You say your affliction seems to be more than you and I'm now telling you,
    <br>No! Look at the screen.
    <br>You say your poverty is more than you - look at the screen.
    <br>You say hardship is more than you - look at the screen.
    <br>You say joblessness is more than you - look at the screen.
    <br>You are saying setback seems to be more than you
    <br>but I'm telling you, look at the screen, what is happening.
    <br>He ran to his master and said, "Master, these people are more than us"
    <br>and the master said to him, "Don't be afraid. I'm saying to you don't be afraid."
    <br>Look at this!
    <br>Don't be afraid!
    <br>Fibroid Bursts From Woman
    <br>For they that are with us here, fighting for us, supporting our position
    <br>are more than the forces of the adversary!
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Those who are with us, fighting for us, protecting us
    <br>are more than the forces of affliction,
    <br>are more than the forces of failure,
    <br>are more than the forces of setback,
    <br>are more than the forces of nightmare,
    <br>are more than the forces of stagnation,
    <br>are more than the forces of career failure!
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Isn't that what you are seeing now?
    <br>Look at the woman who was sitting quietly, then suddenly...
    <br>She was afraid of fibroid but here the Lord is saying to her,
    <br>"Those with us are more than the forces of fibroid".
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Tell your challenges, your situation right now,
    <br>"Those with me here are more than the forces of my challenges!"
    <br>What kind of challenges do you have?
    <br>Tell your challenges:
    <br>"Those who are with me here are more than the forces of you challenges,
    <br>you setback, failure, sickness, affliction!"
    <br>Yes!
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Not only this woman; you will see signs to believe.
    <br>Today, we are like the servant of Elisha who, on the outside, are fighting
    <br>but within, are filled with panic, fear, anxiety.
    <br>I say today you are like servanta of Elisha,
    <br>who on the outside are fighting
    <br>but within are filled with fear.
    <br>You say, "In Jesus' name!"
    <br>Don't lie. It is not like that in the heart.
    <br>"In Jesus' name, I'm talking to you."
    <br>As we are here today, people would think that you are with me.
    <br>Let a tiger enter and see whether you would wait.
    <br>I trust you.
    <br>You would jump through the window.
    <br>You would now tell T.B. Joshua, "Please, I cannot wait. I'm still young."
    <br>I said, "Listen to me. 
    <br>- Amen Amen Amen."
    <br>Let lion just enter...
    <br>"My dear, which T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>That is your life.
    <br>When trouble comes, you seem to be ignorant of your faith.
    <br>When challenges come, you seem to be ignorant of your faith under pressure and tension.
    <br>Under temptation, affliction - ignorance of your faith.
    <br>You begin to count how many tithes you paid, "I'm an usher in the church. My name is Stephen.
    <br>I have stopped smoking, fighting, fornicating, stealing, destroying".
    <br>You start counting your righteousness.
    <br>When trouble comes, you will begin to count your righteousness.
    <br>"I have stopped smoking, going to night clubs. I don't know why all this is still happening to me.
    <br>I don't know. I have stopped smoking, lying. Why all this still happens to me?
    <br>I go to church regularly. Why all this? I'm an usher in the church. I'm a pastor.
    <br>Why all this trouble?"
    <br>That's the time to count your righteousness.
    <br>Say after me, "Today, we are like Elisha's servant who, on the outside, are fighting
    <br>but within, are filled with fear, anxiety and panic."
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Soon, we will waive our hands in worship,
    <br>but within are filled with fear, doubt, unbelief.
    <br>"We worship You, Lord" whereas within - fear, doubt, unbelief.
    <br>In Acts 7:1, Stephen was conscious of his faith even in death.
    <br>Say after me, "Even in death, Stephen was conscious of his faith."
    <br>You know, he was stoned to death.
    <br>At each stone, he said, "In Jesus' name. Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord."
    <br>I trust you.
    <br>If you were faced with stoning, you would say,
    <br>"I'm an usher in the church. Why all this is happening to me?"
    <br>But he was conscious of his faith even in death.
    <br>Paul and Silas,
    <br>under serious threat...
    <br>Paul and Silas, in Acts 16:22 - they were conscious of their faith.
    <br>Daniel, in Daniel 6:10 - he was conscious of his faith even under pressure and tension.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Rise up and let us pray.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace to be conscious of your faith even under pressure and tension,
    <br>to be conscious of your faith under pressure and tension of affliction,
    <br>to be conscious of your faith under pressure of temptation,
    <br>to be conscious of your faith under pressure and tension of hardship, setback.
    <br>Prayer!

    <br>Woman Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>After Fibroid Bursts
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>My name is Joy, I come from Benue State.
    <br>I have been having the problem of fibroid for the past five years.
    <br>I came to the church this morning; I was sitting over there.
    <br>I was feeling heat all over my body.
    <br>I wanted to go out but this man next to me said I should wait.
    <br>I sat down and immediately I saw the man of God coming, our eyes met.
    <br>Something asked me to stand up so I stood up.
    <br>The next thing was that I heard something burst.
    <br>Then, I saw blood coming out!
    <br>I am surprised that the man of God knew my case;
    <br>he said that it was fibroid.
    <br>I went to the hospital and they told me that they needed to operate me.
    <br>But in my life, I have already had five operations.
    <br>So, this time, I said, I could not continue with operations.
    <br>Tell us, how do you feel now, as this fibroid burst from your system and is coming out.
    <br>How do you feel now?
    <br>I feel very good.
    <br>Before I had pain but now I am OK.
    <br>We can see you pressing.
    <br>You mean, you couldn't tap like that before?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Why?
    <br>The pains.
    <br>Women that have fibroids know how it is.
    <br>Now, you are pressing it so hard...
    <br>I feel good now; there is no more pain.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Fibroid Bursts
    <br>Instant Testimony
    <br>Not only that; we can see that you started vomiting out.
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>I started feeling like I would pass out, then something was disturbing me and I vomited.
    <br>So you mean the gentleman sitting by you noticed...
    <br>He noticed me and said that I should not go outside but stay.
    <br>My name is Loveday, I'm from Rivers State.
    <br>What I noticed as I was sitting close to this woman was that she was shaking
    <br>and seemed to be feeling a sensation on her chest.
    <br>She wanted to go out.
    <br>I said, "No, don't go out - stay.
    <br>Today might be your day. Don't go anywhere.
    <br>Please stay here!"
    <br>I begged her until the man of God walked in.
    <br>Then, I saw her get up and she started bleeding!
    <br>She was bleeding seriously; I said, "Ah! Thank God!
    <br>What I told this woman, it has happened. I thank God for everything!"
    <br>You are seeing this and this is happening right before you.
    <br>- In front of me.
    <br>- What can you say about this?
    <br>God is here!
