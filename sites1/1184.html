  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we salute your faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Today we talk about the Word - the Word of God.
    <br>As we all know: Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>And the Bible says in the Book of Romans:
    <br>Anything that does not come from faith is sin.
    <br>That is, anything that does not come from the heart.
    <br>So that is, man's spirit; it's sin, it's wrong.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Take your reading with me to the Book of Isaiah 55 Verse 10.
    <br>It will also be a very important passage for you to read.
    <br>We read the Book of Hebrews Chapter 4.
    <br>And also the Book of Ephesians 3; when you look at verse 17 there, it will also be of help.
    <br>John 3 will help us.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Also take your reading from the Book of John 15; verse 17 too will be of help in our reading.
    <br>So let's take that Book of Hebrews.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands,
    <br>let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.
    <br>For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did;
    <br>but the message they heard was of no value to them
    <br>because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.
    <br>Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said..."
    <br>The word rest, rest rest - take note of that rest, rest.
    <br>"For anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works"
    <br>That is, also rests from their struggles, tension, pressure. Take note of that.
    <br>When you enter God's rest, you also rest from tension, pressure.
    <br>"...just as God did from his.
    <br>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest.
    <br>so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.
    <br>For the Word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword..."
    <br>Like I have said, on getting home, read the Book of Isaiah 55:10; it will help.
    <br>Ephesians 3:17 will help.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>FAITH IS OF MAN'S HEART
    <br>But, there is Bible language that God uses to save us,
    <br>to create us, to judge us and to rule over us - that is Bible language,
    <br>which is language of the heart.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart but today's language we use to gossip, give directions, do politics.
    <br>You know politics today all over the world.
    <br>Today's language is not Bible language
    <br>That is why it is difficult for Christians to involve in politics today
    <br>because they use today's language to do politics, even to do business,
    <br>to sing songs and to talk to our children.
    <br>We say, "Get out of this place, stupid!"
    <br>We don't mean it but the word of the heart means it.
    <br>Tthink of how many times you have booed your children,
    <br>"Get out of this place. Please, stupid, idiot."
    <br>You don't mean it but your heart means it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>That is why God's language is 'Word of Heart'; Bible language is 'Word of Heart'.
    <br>But you don't mean it.
    <br>A lot of business, when you check today you see many people with business cards.
    <br>"I am a contractor, I am an architect, I am a lawyer, I am an engineer, I am this" - a lot of business cards.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We use today's language to pray.
    <br>You see people today using today's language.
    <br>They don't even know the difference between the language of the Bible and today's language.
    <br>People use today's language to pray.
    <br>That is why whatever they say in their prayer, they don't mean it
    <br>and whatever they receive seems not to be permanent because it is mere words.
    <br>"Abide in me, come into my life, save my soul, I am a sinner.
    <br>Today, Lord Jesus, I will follow You to the end of my life."
    <br>But the next day, you will see them somewhere else.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Freedom today, bondage tomorrow because when you are receiving healing, you say,
    <br>"Lord, heal me, heal me. I will give my life to you. Heal me."
    <br>After your healing - because what you are saying is not from your heart.
    <br>So we use today's language to pray, to counsel, to prophesy.
    <br>You see some prophecies will say, "Ah, it will rain tomorrow".
    <br>But you will find that there is no rain because they don't mean what they are saying.
    <br>It is not from their hearts.
    <br>FAITH IS OF MAN'S HEART
    <br>When the Word is in your heart, it will preserve you from desiring sin.
    <br>That is the Word of God.
    <br>You need the Word of God in your heart to bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>You cannot say, " In Jesus' name," and expect Jesus,
    <br>when what you are saying is not from your heart.
    <br>When you don't mean it and you say, "In Jesus' name. Lord Jesus, do this for me, give me this" -
    <br>all what you are saying is not from your heart and you are expecting Jesus to come.
    <br>The Word in your heart can only bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>The Word of God is the living presence of that divine power
    <br>if that Word  comes from the heart.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If that Word comes from the heart;
    <br>it is the living presence of that divine power that heals, saves and delivers.
    <br>But if the Word is not from the heart, you are just talking to yourself;
    <br>you are saying the word of today.
    <br>People use the word of today to pray, to counsel, to evangelise, to prophesy.
    <br>You say, "Ah, I don't want to smoke it". You come to church, you don't want to smoke.
    <br>If this word is not from your heart, it cannot influence your conduct and character.
    <br>It is the Word from the heart that can influence your conduct and character.
    <br>The Word from the heart takes the place of the unseen Jesus.
    <br>Meditation in the Word is a visit with God.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>That meditation from the heart - a visit to Jesus.
    <br>You become a part of the Word by meditation.
    <br>You have to get hold of your heart.
    <br>What is going on in your heart?
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy, oh Lord. 
    <br>More of You.
    <br>This should continue; your heart should continue saying this while looking at me.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>By the time you are busy saying this, you will suddenly see who is talking here.
    <br>I'm not the one talking, but because you are not in the vision, you are not inspired yet.
    <br>You are still seeing a man talking to you. No, I'm not the one talking to you.
    <br>You have to know, you have to see who is talking to you now.
    <br>By revelation.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Continue, turn it over and over again in your heart
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy, Lord Jesus.
    <br>Take more of me; give me more of You -  more of Your faithfulness,
    <br>more of Your obedience, more of Your purity, holiness, Lord.
    <br>Busy, busy then the revelation comes; you will now see who is talking.
    <br>You will see that this is not the man that is talking, "Aha I said it; he is not the one".
    <br>Now after the revelation, God will take you back again to your real self.
    <br>You will now say, "Oh, I'm back again".
    <br>You switch again; this is the life you should live.
    <br>Switch on, on.
    <br>There are a lot of melodies that should be going on in your heart,
    <br>a lot of spiritual songs, hymns.
    <br>You have songs; you know a lot of songs you can continue to engage your heart with.
    <br>I have seen the downfall of satan
    <br>Glory be to God
    <br>Glory be to Jesus
    <br>That should continue in your heart.
    <br>I have seen the downfall of satan
    <br>Glory be to God
    <br>Amen
    <br>Continue in your heart.
    <br>Continue this in your heart.
    <br>Keep your heart busy while looking at me.
    <br>If you cannot see beyond me, it means you are not engaged in God's project.
    <br>You must see beyond me to believe.
    <br>Tell your neighbour
    <br>You must see beyond your pastor to believe.
    <br>Just your pastor you used to see.
    <br>Every day you go to church, you see your pastor moving.
    <br>No. You cannot believe.
    <br>You must see beyond your pastor. Beyond him is the Person talking.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Beyond him - the Person talking .
    <br>Beyond him - the Person preaching.
    <br>That is all. It is not your pastor.
    <br>You keep seeing your pastor every day.
    <br>You are not going to church; you are just a religious person.
    <br>Religious person - that is all.
    <br>You must see beyond. To see beyond is that meditation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What will hinder us?
    <br>What is the reason why you cannot do what I am asking you to do now?
    <br>What will hinder us?
    <br>Our human nature will.
    <br>This has a lot to do with hindering God when there are some mixtures -
    <br>part spirit, part flesh in the heart of man, a constant conflict between flesh and spirit.
    <br>Some will say, "Don't listen to him. - Listen to him.
    <br>Is it possible what he is saying? - It is possible.
    <br>Ah, I don't know; what is that? - No, I have tried it before, try it again".
    <br>A constant conflict between flesh and spirit.
    <br>A struggle between faith and doubt .
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Little time you say, "Take more of me, give me more of You. Locate me in Your mercy.
    <br>Ah, what does the time say?"
    <br>You have abandoned what you are meditating.
    <br>"Take more of me. Give me more of You."
    <br>After little time you say, "Can you help me? Just switch that station, the channel to…"
    <br>You have forgotten what you are talking.
    <br>A struggle between faith and doubt.
    <br>A constant conflict between flesh and spirit when there is division in the heart of man.
    <br>John 3 says, find out the truth and the truth will set you free.
    <br>Wrong, mistake, sin is never covered by our appearance.
    <br>You put on tie, collar, big Bible, cross, garment, big cap.
    <br>Sin, wrong, mistake is never covered by our appearance, presence, prayer or tears.
    <br>Sin is never covered.
    <br>Sin can only be removed by repentance.
    <br>If our appearance cannot cover our sin, our mistake,
    <br>why are we wasting our time over appearance as if it is part of the deal.
    <br>How you look cannot cover your sin, your mistake.
    <br>Your presence whatever majestic has nothing to do with this.
    <br>You must bring your wrong, your mistake, your sin before the Blood of Jesus
    <br>before the Spirit prays through you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>I must bring my wrong, my mistake, my sin before the  Blood of Jesus
    <br>before the Spirit prays through me.
    <br>We don't know how to pray; the Spirit prays.
    <br>We cannot do the work of God; the Spirit of God does.
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>Majesty
    <br>Majesty
    <br>Worship His Majesty
    <br>Unto Jesus
    <br>Be all glory, honour and praise
    <br>Majesty

    <br>Flows from His throne

    <br>So exalt

    <br>The name of Jesus

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where shall we start now?
    <br>I'm talking about your life.
    <br>You cannot continue this way.
    <br>You have much, much, much to do.
    <br>Don't let your age deceive you.
    <br>Don't let your wealth deceive you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is the Spirit of God that can maintain when it comes to maintenance.
    <br>You can achieve in whatever way but to  maintain, nothing can maintain it except God.
    <br>There is no way you can maintain your career.
    <br>Look at our leaders, our heroes, the most powerful in the world - you read about them.
    <br>Many of them failed to maintain their profile.
    <br>That you do not mean what you are saying does not mean you cannot receive healing.
    <br>You will receive healing, if you don't mean it. You say, "Ok, let me just come here".
    <br>And you don't mean what you are saying but you have problems.
    <br>The problem can be solved but to maintain that...
    <br>It is better not to receive than to lose.
    <br>But the people that say "Congratulations!" will later see you and say, "What is wrong again?"
    <br>You start crying, "What is all this?"
    <br>This is why I am asking, where shall we start?
    <br>Since we know what hinders us is our human nature.
    <br>Like I have said:
    <br>This has a lot to do with hindering God in your life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>This has a lot to do with hindering God in our life
    <br>when the human will is not wholly surrendered
    <br>Your will refuses to surrender.
    <br>You want to go there and the will of God says, "No, don't go", and you say, "I will go".
    <br>There is a discretion everyone has; you have discretion.
    <br>Look at the man at the pool of Bethesda.
    <br>Jesus asked him, "What can I do for you?"
    <br>He had the power and the grace to carry him.
    <br>When you are in trouble, let Him carry you; drop him in this pool.
    <br>Instead he said, "Oh, what can I do for you? Do you want me to help you or not?"
    <br>And the man said, "Please, help me".
    <br>You have discretion; that discretion is a special blessing for you.
    <br>You can say, "No, what T.B. Joshua is saying is nonsense.
    <br>I can't understand what he is saying".
    <br>You have the right.
    <br>I surrender
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>All to Thee
    <br>My blessed Saviour
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>All to Thee
    <br>My blessed Saviour
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>All to Jesus I surrender
    <br>All to Him I freely give
    <br>I will ever love and trust Him
    <br>In His presence daily live
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>All to Thee
    <br>My blessed Saviour
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>Part spirit, part flesh - a constant conflict between flesh and spirit.
    <br>That is the struggle you are going through,
    <br>A constant conflict between flesh and spirit.
    <br>If God is coming, your heart is the contact point
    <br>but in that heart, there is a constant conflict.
    <br>There is a battle.
    <br>Go - don't go.
    <br>Take - don't take.
    <br>This is where you are.
    <br>When you want to pray, "Lord Jesus, help me to get there",
    <br>something will be telling you too, "You will not get there".
    <br>This is why I am saying,
    <br>don't let your wealth deceive you; you have not got there.
    <br>The richest man in your family - you say, "Oh, he has succeeded"; you want to be like him.
    <br>How do you know he has succeeded? Because of wealth?
    <br>Man's natural gift cannot make one succeed.
    <br>Success is all about the spirit, supernatural.
    <br>You can suddenly die and leave, and the enemy will start sharing them.
    <br>If our leaders know this, superiority complex and all these fights, will cease -
    <br>if they know they are not what they think they are.
    <br>Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What shall I render
    <br>What shall I render
    <br>What shall I render to You oh Lord
    <br>I will praise You oh Lord
    <br>And shout hallelujah
    <br>What shall I render to You oh Lord
    <br>What shall I render
    <br>What shall I render to You oh Lord
    <br>I will praise You oh Lord
    <br>And shout hallelujah
    <br>What shall I render to You oh Lord
    <br>What your heart is telling you, saying about you, is what you are.
    <br>What your heart is telling you now is what you are.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>What your heart is telling you now is what you are.
    <br>Tell yourself. Speak to yourself.
    <br>What my heart is telling me now is what I am.
    <br>Listen to your heart.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning and you want to go somewhere, just listen to your heart.
    <br>Your heart will say, "Go; don't go".
    <br>Heart is about meditation.
    <br>You have been living in a thinking processing, not meditation processing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You have been living in a thinking processing, not meditation processing.
    <br>There is a difference - meditation is about God; thinking is about our problems.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People can see you as a poor man but your heart is telling you, "You are great".
    <br>Indeed, you are great.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You see a poor man and it is hard to be saying, "Oh, you are great".
    <br>Indeed he is great.
    <br>But while you rich, your heart will be telling you, "You are the poorest in the world".
    <br>Upon the culture, money you are seeing - yet the heart is saying it is poor.
    <br>So it means such money will not last.
    <br>Whatever you cannot enjoy to the last is not of God.
    <br>If what you are cannot be witnessed by generations yet unborn
    <br>it means it is not for generations and God is of generations.
    <br>God is of generations.
    <br>Whatever you are that cannot be witnessed by generations yet unborn,
    <br>is not of God because God is of generations.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, please, let's build our life.
    <br>Commit your life to God for generations yet unborn to witness and see.
    <br>What you are enjoying today, some had paid the supreme price to bring them.
    <br>Heart means, 'mean it'.
    <br>Tell your neighbour
    <br>Heart means, 'mean it'.
    <br>I can't understand.
    <br>Heart means, 'mean it'.
    <br>Whatever comes from the heart, we mean it.
    <br>This is why each time I'm praying for you, I say, "Mean it, mean it".
    <br>It is a place where there is no doubt.
    <br>Mean it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Mean it. Mean what you are saying.
    <br>In your heart, talk to yourself in hymns, songs and melodies.
    <br>We are created to keep our heart busy with the Lord.
    <br>Keep your heart praising God; that is what you are created for.
    <br>Our heart must be busy praising God.
    <br>But your heart has been...
    <br>Can you imagine how old you are now?
    <br>Your heart has been roaming about.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are created to keep our heart busy for God, praising God.
    <br>Busy, busy, busy.
    <br>At the beginning, it may look very difficult.
    <br>The beginning of everything is always very difficult.
    <br>But as time goes on, it will be part of you.
    <br>Keep your heart praising God.
    <br>I will praise You
    <br>I will praise You forever more
    <br>For Your goodness
    <br>I will praise You
    <br>I will praise You forever more
    <br>For your kindness
    <br>I will praise You
    <br>I will praise You forever more
    <br>Keep your heart praising God in songs, hymns and melodies.
    <br>That is what you were created for, and when you start this, you will come back and give testimony.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, you are supposed to know God's opinion about yourself.
    <br>No matter what you are, no matter what you acquire, no matter how great you are,
    <br>if you don't know God's opinion about yourself and about others,
    <br>whatever you acquire is zero.
    <br>The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>Tell your neighbor
    <br>The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>Yes. because your spiritual life is the engine that will carry your success.
    <br>If you prosper financially and you are just like a little baby in your spiritual life,
    <br>that money you have will be spent by the enemy.
    <br>You take it to care for sickness, to run from one problem to another,
    <br>to run for medical Check-up.
    <br>You will realise that the money will be spending you instead of you spending the money.
    <br>You know money can be spending one.
    <br>You are supposed to spend your money but instead, the money will now be the one to spend you.
    <br>You will not be able to eat any food you want to eat.
    <br>There will be certain food you should not eat and certain food you should eat.
    <br>If you try to eat other food, you will be in trouble.
    <br>You have so much medication you have to take in the morning, afternoon, evening.
    <br>You start seeing yourself that way.
    <br>The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life
    <br>If you are not prospering in your spiritual life and you are great,
    <br>your greatness will be fading away gradually because there is nothing to carry it.
    <br>So that is why you have to take your time.
    <br>Leave that money, pray.
    <br>Find time to pray; don't let money control you.
    <br>Let the Giver of that money control you.
    <br>But today, what is happening? Where are you living?
    <br>Because you have money, where you were living before,
    <br>you have to leave the place and live where rich people live.
    <br>Money is the one controlling you.
    <br>Do you know where you started?
    <br>Do you know your beginning? Where are you living now?
    <br>You live among the rich because you are a rich man.
    <br>That is money control; not the Giver of the money.
    <br>The rich are living together and the poor are living together. Who will help the poor?
    <br>And you are blessed to bless others.
    <br>You are blessed to bless others; you are saved to save others -
    <br>that is the purpose of your blessing.
    <br>You are blessed to bless others.
    <br>This is the cause of the problem now all over the world.
    <br>If God gives you breakthrough and you become so rich, and you are now mismanaging, misbehaving.
    <br>His peace you cannot run away with.
    <br>You can run away with riches, wealth but His peace of heart, you cannot run away with.
    <br>So like people sitting down now, they are looking for prayer, they want prayer.
    <br>You are here for breakthrough in your business but after the prayer, you have breakthrough,
    <br>billions of dollars - you receive it , and then you say, "Ah, I have received it" and you run from God.
    <br>But His peace, you cannot go away with it.
    <br>You will run away with the money, run away with wealth, run away with the fame, but the peace of God...
    <br>God will be looking at you to see the money you have taken, He has given you -
    <br>how you spend it will determine the peace of God in your heart.

    <br>So this is what is happening all over the world today.
    <br>This why you see so many rich, wealthy people all over the world without peace.
    <br>How do we know that they don't have peace?
    <br>The conflict among them will tell you that these people have no peace.
    <br>But if you have peace of heart, people are insulting you, beating you, you will be saying, "Take it easy".
    <br>Peace does not want conflict. He wants peace.
    <br>Peace is always fighting for peace, unity, love.
    <br>When He gives you that greatness, He will hold on with this peace to be monitoring you
    <br>to see how you go about your greatness.
    <br>That will determine how He will release the peace.
    <br>So please, the first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>You are to go back to your drawing board.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Go back".
    <br>Go back to the college of God and seek the Spirit of God.
    <br>Yes, you are to go back.
    <br>If you know you have plenty - money, property - please, go back.
    <br>Man live without peace.
    <br>Are you one of them?
    <br>God bless His Word.
