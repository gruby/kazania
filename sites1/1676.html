    <br>AT CHRISTMAS, LET YOUR SEED MOVE GOD!!! | Yinka Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Good Morning to you all, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "Merry Christmas!"
    <br>Greet the next person beside you, say, "Merry Christmas!"
    <br>Now greet the viewers on Emmanuel TV, say, "Merry Christmas!"
    <br>Yes!
    <br>On behalf of The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations and the Emmanuel TV family,
    <br>we want to welcome you this morning
    <br>and wish you a blessed Yuletide season in Jesus' name.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the reason for the season.
    <br>Without Jesus Christ there is no Christmas.
    <br>Once again:
    <br>We wish you Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year, in Jesus' name!
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God and say, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It's a wonderful thing to see this day; it's indeed the day the Lord has made
    <br>and you will rejoice and be glad in it.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The anniversary of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, as we all know,
    <br>is not only a time for celebration
    <br>but also an occasion for reflection, an occasion for change.
    <br>It is a time to give our best
    <br>because Jesus Christ desires and deserves our very best.
    <br>What best have you prepared to give this Christmas?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What best have you prepared to give this Christmas?"
    <br>In the Book of John 3:16, the Bible says for God so loved the world
    <br>that He planted His best Seed in the earth to produce a family.
    <br>Today, millions are born again through this best Seed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Seed gave Himself up for our sake - all of us - as a living sacrifice
    <br>to heal the broken-hearted, comfort those who mourn,
    <br>release the prisoners and defeat our enemies.
    <br>The question is:
    <br>Have you received the nourishment and life offered by Christ Jesus?
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>have you received the nourishment and life offered by our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ?
    <br>If not, you are missing the special gifts He has for you.
    <br>Just as God planted His love, so also are we expected to plant
    <br>and receive more of whatever seed we sow.
    <br>Now, the question is: What seed are you planting this Christmas?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What seed are you planting, brethren?
    <br>It is important for you to know that before you plant your seed,
    <br>you must understand that your seed must, first of all, move your faith.
    <br>I know we have faith - that is why we are in the presence of God
    <br>but you must understand that your seed, which you need to plant must,
    <br>first of all, move your faith.
    <br>When your seed moves your faith, your faith moves God.
    <br>I don't know the challenges you are facing this morning but one thing is sure.
    <br>To realise the promises that He has for you and me this Christmas, we must play our role.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>this is an opportunity to reshape your destiny."
    <br>No! If you want to reshape your destiny, say it with joy!
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>this is an opportunity to reshape your destiny
    <br>by letting your seed move God."
    <br>This will bring me to the title of this message:
    <br>AT CHRISTMAS, LET YOUR SEED MOVE GOD
    <br>I know, we have so much seed, so many gifts to give
    <br>but whatever seed it might be, let it move God.
    <br>I want you to take time right now to think of someone in particular, who needs your seed.
    <br>Think of someone right now, as you are seated.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, think of someone in particular who needs your seed.
    <br>If you want to be released into a new beginning,
    <br>then plant a seed today that will reshape your destiny.
    <br>If you want to be released into a new beginning,
    <br>plant a seed that will rekindle your goal in life.
    <br>I know we have so many gifts we have prepared for our loved ones,
    <br>our well wishers, our friends, our family.
    <br>What gifts are you preparing to give to those who hate you, those who hurt you,
    <br>those who do not share the same faith with you, your enemy?
    <br>What gifts are you preparing to give them?
    <br>Come to think of it.
    <br>Why is it so easy for anyone to part with their belongings - things on the outside -
    <br>than to part with sin - things that have to do with attitude and character,
    <br>such as hate, unforgiveness, greed, selfishness?
    <br>You know, the seed you ought to plant may be different from another's
    <br>but be sure to plant a seed that will reshape your destiny.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>plant that seed that will move God to reshape your destiny."
    <br>Now, let's quickly turn our Bible to our first proof text for today's message,
    <br>taken from the Book of Isaiah 9:6.
    <br>Let someone say, "Love was born at Christmas."
    <br>Say, "Forgiveness was born at Christmas."
    <br>Say, "Giving spirit was born at Christmas."
    <br>Unity was born at Christmas.
    <br>This is the moment of reconciliation.
    <br>Now, let's turn our Bible to the Book of Isaiah 9
    <br>and let us take our reading from verse 6.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given;
    <br>And the government will be upon His shoulder.
    <br>And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
    <br>Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
    <br>Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end
    <br>upon the throne of David and over His kingdom,
    <br>to order it and establish it with judgment and justice
    <br>from that time forward, even forever.
    <br>The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this."
    <br>Can I hear you shout "Amen"?
    <br>Once again: Merry Christmas!
    <br>The Bible makes us to understand that of His birth
    <br>three things were promised unto us
    <br>which become the basis of our eternal hope:
    <br>1. the glorious light that will dispel every shade of darkness in our lives;
    <br>2. the glorious increase and complete joy arising from His birth;
    <br>3. the glorious liberty and enlargement with good reason.
    <br>Do you know that many people have suppressed
    <br>these promises in their lives by failing to walk in love?
    <br>Failure to walk in love
    <br>can almost shut down one's spiritual walk with the Lord.
    <br>The Bible says that love is more important;
    <br>it is the greatest because it is the force that sets our faith working.
    <br>Remember, God's love is not self-centred;
    <br>it reaches out and draws others in.
    <br>What seed are you planting this Christmas?
    <br>How best do you display your love for God in the choices and decisions you take?
    <br>Think about it: How best do you display your love for God in the choices you are making
    <br>and the decisions you are taking on a daily basis?
    <br>Ask Cornelius, the Roman army officer, in the Book of Acts 10 and he will tell you
    <br>when we sow love in action,
    <br>we are planting seeds that will return to us a bountiful harvest of whatever love we sowed.
    <br>I know many people know the story of Cornelius but take your time and read.
    <br>The Bible says his case is one of the typical examples of how one seed of love planted
    <br>in humility and sincerity of heart can change one's destiny forever.
    <br>The Bible says that Cornelius was never a believer in Christ Jesus
    <br>but the Bible says that he kept seeking God.
    <br>He was reverent and generous; God filled him with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>When you read that same Acts, the Bible says Peter - an Apostle of Jesus Christ -
    <br>was amazed about how God miraculously changed the destiny of the Roman officer;
    <br>just as we are awaiting for our destiny to be changed at this season,
    <br>because this is a season of change.
    <br>Peter, one of the Apostles of Jesus, was amazed about how God miraculously
    <br>changed the destiny of the Roman officer.
    <br>The Bible says his case describes God's willingness
    <br>to use extraordinary means to reach out to those
    <br>who prove their love to others through their seed.
    <br>Take your time and read; that will be your assignment today.
    <br>The attitude and character of Cornelius -
    <br>you know he was never a believer in Christ but he saw God.
    <br>His case describes God's willingness to use extraordinary means to reach out to those
    <br>who prove their love for others through their seed.
    <br>Of a truth, those who genuinely seek God will find Him.
    <br>What seed are you planting this Christmas?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How do you really prove your love for God?"
    <br>At this Christmas we must be concerned about the just treatment of our fellow brothers.
    <br>You must be concerned about the weak, the widowers -
    <br>even your enemies, you must be concerned about them.
    <br>Until we give God what is due to Him, He cannot give us what is due to us.
    <br>I know we have a lot of requests; we have a lot of things that we are asking God to give.
    <br>But don't forget that until you give God what is due to Him,
    <br>He cannot give you what is due to you.
    <br>You may be complaining that nothing is working out
    <br>but don't forget that God is measuring your love for your fellow brothers.
    <br>The love for your fellow brothers - is it burning in your heart,
    <br>is it sacrificial, is it practical, is it active?
    <br>Examine yourself.
    <br>This is a moment of reflection.
    <br>Who knows? Perhaps that seed of love,
    <br>that seed of forgiveness, the seed of patience, humility,
    <br>may be what God will use to reshape your destiny, even the destiny of your children.
    <br>Who knows?
    <br>But be sure to plant the seed today that will move God to reshape your destiny.
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "Merry Christmas!"
    <br>You know satan, the enemy of God, will not want anyone to love or forgive.
    <br>He feeds on impurities such as selfishness, greed, unforgiveness, hate.
    <br>Those are the instruments he uses to connect man to himself
    <br>and that is why Jesus came to re-establish
    <br>the wholeness that man had before the fall.
    <br>Any moment from now we will be entering 2020, by the grace of God.
    <br>Why are you delaying your progress?
    <br>Stop delaying your progress.
    <br>Are you waiting for those who hurt you to come to you and say, "Please forgive me"?
    <br>Or you are waiting for those who are in dire need of something you possess
    <br>to beg before you stretch the hands of help to them?
    <br>Such love cannot attract Jesus to perform for us,
    <br>because the way and manner we plant our seeds matters a lot to God.
    <br>If you plant your seed today with genuineness and simplicity of heart,
    <br>your seed will ultimately reshape your destiny.
    <br>If you plant your seed with all your heart with simplicity and humility,
    <br>not giving to be seen or to be praised,
    <br>that seed will ultimately reshape your destiny.
    <br>People of God, when you look around the world today
    <br>you will see that the word love has been watered down.
    <br>Love has lost its original meaning.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that what makes you and me human is not our ability to think
    <br>but our ability to love -
    <br>just as God so loved the world that He planted His most precious Seed.
    <br>Love is life; when we miss love, we miss life.
    <br>Always remember that the significance of Christmas is a clear proof that Jesus Christ is love.
    <br>When you go about celebrating Christmas, remember it is all about the love you show
    <br>to your fellow brothers.
    <br>How is it burning in your heart?
    <br>Love is humble; remember, it does not express itself in arrogance.
    <br>The love of Christ is patient; it does not express itself in anger.
    <br>As you go about celebrating Christmas,
    <br>remember the love of God is goodness; it does not express itself in evil.
    <br>The love of God is hope; it does not express itself in self-pity.
    <br>Just as the Book of John 3:16 says that we are all sons and daughters of love; we are love's product.
    <br>Let us do love.
    <br>At this Christmas let us act love; let us follow in the light of love.
    <br>I want to urge you, viewers all over the world,
    <br>try as much as possible to make a positive impact
    <br>on anyone who crosses your path as from today,
    <br>because you never know what tomorrow might bring.
    <br>As from today, viewers all over the world,
    <br>make a positive impact on those who cross your path as from today,
    <br>because you never know what tomorrow might bring.
    <br>Are you in a position of power, authority?
    <br>Whatever condition you find yourself in - whether you are weak or strong -
    <br>make a positive impact on anyone as from today,
    <br>because you never know what tomorrow might bring.
    <br>Finally brethren,
    <br>quickly turn with me to the Book of 1 John.
    <br>Let's go to 1 John chapter 2,
    <br>and there we will quickly take our reading from verse 3.
    <br>"Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.
    <br>He who says, 'I know Him,' and does not keep His commandments, is a liar,
    <br>and the truth is not in him."
    <br>Verse 5:
    <br>"But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him.
    <br>By this we know that we are in Him."
    <br>Now, verse 9:
    <br>"He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now."
    <br>Can we read this verse 9 together and make it personal to ourselves?
    <br>"He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now."
    <br>Verse 10:
    <br>"He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him."
    <br>Now, take the next verse.
    <br>"But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know
    <br>where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes."
    <br>Always remember that verse: 'He who hates his brother up 'til now
    <br>is still walking in darkness.'
    <br>You may claim you are a Christian, you may claim you are born-again,
    <br>you may claim you are a minister of God but if you keep hating your brother,
    <br>you are still walking in darkness and until now you are fully blind.
    <br>When you look around the world, you will see that many have been slaves
    <br>to darkness for a very long time.
    <br>Many have been slaves to darkness for a very long time.
    <br>This is an opportunity for you to be released from your captivity
    <br>into His marvellous light.
    <br>You may be asking, "But how much seed should I sow to reshape my destiny?
    <br>How many gifts?
    <br>How much should I give?"
    <br>You know it is not the quantity of the seed you sow that matters
    <br>but the quality is what attracts Jesus to perform for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We may not have to die for someone but there are other ways
    <br>we can prove and show our sacrificial love to our fellow brothers.
    <br>At this Christmas let us be known for our solicitousness,
    <br>our concern for those people whose condition exposes them to exploitation, oppression,
    <br>because man, if he truly loves God, is under obligation to love
    <br>his fellow brother irrespective of background, culture, ethnicity, race or gender.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, as you go about celebrating this Christmas,
    <br>remember the weak, the poor, the strong, those who do not share the same faith with you,
    <br>even your enemies; this is the opportunity to remember those you need to reconcile with.
    <br>You are just a moment away from a new beginning.
    <br>This is the best time to sow the seed that will move God to reshape your destiny.
    <br>Remember, God's path of plenty can never fail;
    <br>it is as sure as the Book of John 3:16.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of your heart.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What gifts are you sowing for those who hate you?
    <br>What seed are you sowing for those who hurt you?
    <br>What seed are you sowing for those who do not share the same faith with you?"
    <br>Let these questions continue to pound in your heart, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you.
