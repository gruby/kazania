    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Lord, thank You for every moment of Your attention.
    <br>Lord, thank You for all the way long.
    <br>Despite all my sins, I'm still alive in Your presence.
    <br>Thank You for Your grace.
    <br>Thank You for Your mercy.
    <br>Thank You for Your forgiveness, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>Heavenly greetings in Christ Jesus to you.
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How are you today?"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>I don't know what your situation is but one thing I know: There is a way out."
    <br>One thing I know: You are not here today by accident; there is an appointment for you.
    <br>You believe that?
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The question I want to ask you:
    <br>What does Jesus see when He is looking at you?
    <br>What does Jesus see in you?
    <br>Do you see yourself the way Jesus sees you?
    <br>If you see yourself the way Jesus sees you, you will not condemn yourself.
    <br>If you see yourself the way Jesus sees you,
    <br>no matter your situation, you will not measure yourself by yourself.
    <br>If you see yourself the way Jesus sees you, you will not compare yourself with others.
    <br>I pray today that Jesus opens the eyes of your faith
    <br>to see yourself as He sees you, in Jesus' name!
    <br>In the Book of John 9:1, Jesus opened the eyes of a blind man.
    <br>The miracle was so perfect, so complete that all who once knew this man as a poor man,
    <br>as a blind beggar, could hardly believe it was the same man
    <br>because of the great changes that had taken place in the life of this man.
    <br>Since that man had an appointment with Jesus, his life was turned around.
    <br>There was a turnaround in everything that had to do with him.
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>God's will for you is to be physically healed and spiritually saved.
    <br>Say, "God's will for me is to be physically healed and spiritually saved".
    <br>Jesus wants you to do what no one has ever done.
    <br>He wants you to make a way where there is no way.
    <br>When Jesus blesses you today, He blesses you effectually.
    <br>When Jesus delivers you today, He delivers you effectually.
    <br>Let someone say, "Jesus is the Problem Solver".
    <br>When Jesus Christ enters our life, He puts an end to our past and gives birth to our future.
    <br>He puts an end to anxiety, fear and gives birth to the peace from Heaven.
    <br>He puts an end to hardship, darkness and gives birth to the light.
    <br>Today is your day of appointment with Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Today is my day, the day that the Lord has made.
    <br>I will rejoice and be glad in it!"
    <br>You believe that?
    <br>So, shall it be.
    <br>This leads us to our message today:
    <br>AN APPOINTMENT WITH JESUS
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your appointment with Jesus".
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of 2 Corinthians 6:2:
    <br>"For He says: 'In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you.'
    <br>Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus knows you better than you know yourself.
    <br>Man looks at the outside but Jesus looks at the inside.
    <br>It is one thing to see you outwardly; it is another thing to see your faith.
    <br>Jesus looks at the heart because faith is of man's heart.
    <br>Jesus demands for our faith.
    <br>When you are face-to-face with Him, He is not interested in your outward appearance -
    <br>your attire, your position - but in your faith
    <br>because that is what makes you one with Him.
    <br>No matter your situation today, no matter what brought you here today -
    <br>show your faith as someone who wants to come to Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, show your faith as someone who wants to come to Jesus".
    <br>In similar encounters with those who Jesus healed, saved, blessed and delivered,
    <br>Jesus first asked them probing questions:
    <br>"What do you want Me to do for you today?"
    <br>"Do you believe in the Son of man?"
    <br>"Do you want to get well?"
    <br>This means before you show your faith to Him,
    <br>you must know what You want Him to be for you.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>before you show your faith,
    <br>you must know what you need God to be for you today."
    <br>You need to discover yourself first.
    <br>When you discover your weakness, you will discover your need for God's strength.
    <br>When someone discovers himself as in need of redemption and salvation,
    <br>then he will discover his need for the Saviour
    <br>because God is whom you need Him to be.
    <br>Let someone say, "God is whom you need Him to be."
    <br>What do you need God to be for you today?
    <br>Do you want Him to be the God you rely on in times of difficulties and trials?
    <br>He shall be.
    <br>Do you want Him to be the God who saves and rescues?
    <br>Then trust in Him alone.
    <br>Do you want Him to be the God that answers prayers?
    <br>Then exercise your faith in Him, in His name.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, act faith, no matter what you are going through."
    <br>Act faith, as the woman with the issue of blood did.
    <br>She was in dire need of healing, but she knew...
    <br>When you know how reliable God Almighty is, faith comes spontaneously.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, when you know how reliable God is, faith comes spontaneously".
    <br>She heard about Jesus; she looked for Him and found Him.
    <br>When she heard about Jesus of Nazareth,
    <br>the Bible says, she believed and she spoke to herself.
    <br>In Matthew 9:21, she says, "I know, I am convinced.
    <br>If only I can touch the hem of His garment, I know I shall be healed."
    <br>"I know; if only I can step my feet on this arena of liberty, I will be healed."
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Let that run into your heart, for Jesus listens to your heart.
    <br>She says if only I can touch, get to Him...
    <br>What we say, what we do expresses our belief.
    <br>She expressed her belief by reaching out to Jesus despite the obstacles.
    <br>The Bible says Jesus was surrounded by a very thick crowd - no place to move,
    <br>but she kept her focus on Him and she elbowed her way to Jesus and touched the hem of His garment.
    <br>The Bible says the power flowed and touched her
    <br>and the issue of blood ceased instantly.
    <br>I don't know whether you have the same issue today -
    <br>with the same attitude of mind, that flow will cease today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>What we do expresses our belief.
    <br>She reached out to Jesus and Jesus changed her life.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Are you in the dark - be it in your home, business, career?
    <br>Are you looking for the way out?
    <br>Ask Saul and he will tell you that in Christ Jesus
    <br>there is a glorious light, a light that shuns every shade of darkness in our lives.
    <br>Saul, being a Pharisee, knew the Book of Moses but he still did not know who Jesus is.
    <br>When you know the truth, where the true light comes from,
    <br>you will know whom you are and whom God is.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>when you discover the truth, where the true light comes from,
    <br>you will know whom you are and whom God is."
    <br>That is the foundation.
    <br>Are you facing a difficult situation, a hopeless situation?
    <br>No one is hopeless whose hope is in Jesus Christ.
    <br>Ask the man at the pool of Bethesda and he will tell you that
    <br>no one is hopeless whose hope is in Jesus.
    <br>The Bible says for 38 years the man sought the face of God for his healing.
    <br>Miracles were happening by the pool while he lay down hopelessly.
    <br>He was in dire need of someone to help him, to rescue him.
    <br>He tried everything to help himself by human wisdom but he failed.
    <br>But the Scripture says the longer he stayed at the pool,
    <br>the more his desire for that Someone, that Helper, until he met Jesus.
    <br>Jesus met him at that point of desperation and changed his life.
    <br>He asked him, "Do you want to get well?"
    <br>The question Jesus asked the man was enough for the man to dismiss Jesus,
    <br>but the Bible says his mind was disciplined by the patience he went through.
    <br>That gave him the maturity of mind to assess the sincerity and commitment
    <br>of the One who was talking to him - Jesus, the One who was able to put an end to his past.
    <br>When Jesus said to him, "Take up your mat and walk,"
    <br>he obeyed and he was healed.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>no matter your situation, all you need is an appointment with Jesus."
    <br>Do you feel as if life has cheated you?
    <br>Ask the woman of Samaria; Jesus met her.
    <br>The Bible says she represents all those who are in dire need of redemption
    <br>from the cares and lures, entanglements of this world.
    <br>She was frustrated but deep inside of her,
    <br>she yearned for the radical transformation of life that
    <br>only the promised Messiah can bring.
    <br>When Jesus revealed Himself to her as the promised Messiah,
    <br>the Bible says, she believed and became part of the world of truth.
    <br>Today, if you believe, no matter how long you have been in that situation,
    <br>your life will never be the same.
    <br>What can we learn from these Biblical characters we mentioned?
    <br>Brothers and sisters, there is appointment in disappointment if God is involved.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, there is appointment in disappointment if God is involved."
    <br>By divine appointment with Jesus today, there is appointment in disappointment,
    <br>there is breakthrough in hardship and there is healing in sickness.
    <br>They all came from different backgrounds, but one thing you need to know:
    <br>Jesus never rejects anyone who comes to Him by faith and in faith.
    <br>The only command of Jesus is: Only believe.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, only believe!"
    <br>If you believe, all things are possible.
    <br>If you believe today, there will be a radical transformation of your life.
    <br>Only believe.
    <br>Believing in Christ Jesus redeems our life.
    <br>Believing in Christ redeems our way.
    <br>Believing in Christ Jesus redeems our time.
    <br>All your wasted time and years will be redeemed today, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>This is December; you know what you have been through this year.
    <br>Just believe.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, just believe".
    <br>Just believe and your life will never be the same!
    <br>Finally brethren,
    <br>where you are coming from does not matter to the Redeemer.
    <br>Where you are coming from - no matter what you have done -
    <br>does not matter to Him because Jesus does not consult your past to determine your future.
    <br>Jesus is on His way to you today to give you a new beginning.
    <br>He is the Commander, He is the Controller, He is the Instructor.
    <br>When He says yes, nobody can say no!
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Then begin to rejoice and say, "Thank You, Jesus, for my time".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus for this day.
    <br>I am standing on Your Word, on the assurance of salvation.
    <br>Jesus is on His way to you!
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, there is hope".
    <br>Whether you are educated or not,
    <br>whether you are a farmer or a professor;
    <br>start loving Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, start loving Jesus.
    <br>Viewers, start loving Jesus".
    <br>Stop complaining about those who failed you in the past.
    <br>Stop complaining that no one in your family has made it in life.
    <br>Stop complaining.
    <br>Stop complaining of your limited education.
    <br>An encounter with Him today, an appointment with Jesus
    <br>will reposition you to fulfill your destiny, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say, "Lord, I am ready!"
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Are you ready with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul?
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus, for my salvation".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for my healing.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for my deliverance.
    <br>Be blessed, in Jesus' name.
