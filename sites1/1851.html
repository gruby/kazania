    <br>BREAKING NEWS
    <br>Statement From Prophet T.B. Joshua On Reopening Of Churches By The Nigerian Government
    <br>Viewers, don't forget there was a revelation three times concerning the church closing. 
    <br>Let us watch the prophecy.
    <br>On Sunday, 24th February 2019, Propphet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message
    <br>about a vision God had given him concerning the SCOAN service.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>The thing God is still telling me -
    <br>you will just get here one day,
    <br>you will learn that there is no church.
    <br>Please, meet me on Emmanuel TV - no church.
    <br>So, you'll meet me on Emmanuel TV talking to you,
    <br>or when there is a revival, you will see me.
    <br>So, we have to be serious.
    <br>On Sunday, 7th April 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied further 
    <br>about the vision he had seen regarding the church service at The SCOAN.
    <br>This is what he said.
    <br>You know, I told you people of recent:
    <br>You may be here, you'll learn that there is no service - close the church.
    <br>You meet us on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Now, we are in a perilous time - a very difficult time.
    <br>Hear what is happening all over the world.
    <br>Fearful year!
    <br>A lot happened and our protection is God.
    <br>On Sunday, 5th January 2020, for the third time, Prophet T.B. Joshua once again prophesied
    <br>about what he saw would happen this year concerning The SCOAN service.
    <br>This is what he said.
    <br>I'm so concerned about what is going to happen this year -
    <br>so much concerned than anything.
    <br>If it's going to cause me to close the church and find out what is going to happen -
    <br>because everywhere is fear.
    <br>If something wants to catch you, it should not catch you unprepared.
    <br>You don't mind but I am very, very concerned.
    <br>Viewers, that same God we are waiting to hear from on when to reopen –
    <br>when things will go back to normal – as usual.
    <br>God’s time is the best. 
    <br>We are waiting at His feet for that time. 
    <br>We are tarrying for the Holy Spirit’s instruction.
    <br>Pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17).
    <br>Meet us as usual on Emmanuel TV until we hear from God when to reopen, 
    <br>the same God who gave us the prophecy three times about the church closing.
    <br>It is God’s work, not our work.
    <br>Here, our thanks go to the authorities for understanding.
    <br>Christian seek not yet repose
    <br>Hear thy guardian angel say
    <br>Thou art in the midst of foes
    <br>Watch and pray
    <br>Jesus is Lord!
