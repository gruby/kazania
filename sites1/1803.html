    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>Good Morning, viewers around the world, and Happy Sunday!
    <br>We are happy to be in the Studio this morning with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>We have a wonderful response from the message last week,
    <br>where you spoke about what it means to be a Christian.
    <br>We received actually hundreds of emails from viewers who had questions regarding that topic.
    <br>If we could ask you a few of those questions.
    <br>Go ahead. Thank you.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>The first question:
    <br>Good morning and win today.
    <br>I have had some questions for such a long time in my heart.
    <br>What can you say about a Christian and sin or mistake?
    <br>Why the question of sin again?
    <br>I want to believe that my people are getting very serious.
    <br>That is a good step.
    <br>When you begin to think of sin, sin, sin, sin, it means you are getting tired.
    <br>I want to believe that my people are really serious, real.
    <br>People want to be real and always are talking about sin, which is good.
    <br>It's a good thing.
    <br>Well. It is only there is a mix-up: What my people want to do is not what they are doing now.
    <br>What they want to eat is not what they are eating.
    <br>What they want to say is not what they are saying.
    <br>- You know the situation around the world.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Can we keep sinning and expect God's grace?
    <br>Absolutely not!
    <br>Here we are.
    <br>The devil is at work; the devil wants us to curse God while under pain.
    <br>While under trouble, hardship, he wants us to curse God - that is his aim.
    <br>Those who bless God in trouble, in pain prove their sonship.
    <br>Viewers, I want to tell you that the lockdown will soon be over.
    <br>I feel what you are feeling.
    <br>I know what you are going through.
    <br>Sin's power over you - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Back to your question:
    <br>You are telling me about sin and Christianity. They are not one; they are not synonymous.
    <br>They are two things entirely opposite.
    <br>The Book of 1 John - that will give us a very brief detail about this.
    <br>1 John 1:8
    <br>It says:
    <br>"If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."
    <br>John wrote to the believers advising them not to sin, but also warned them,
    <br>"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."
    <br>Take note of the word "sin". It's in the singular, suggestive of the sin nature.
    <br>This means if we say we do not have that sin nature or ability to sin, we deceive ourselves.
    <br>That is what John is saying there.
    <br>He further says in the next verse, 1 John 1:10, "If we claim we have not sinned,
    <br>we make God a liar and the truth is not in us."
    <br>I mean, His Word is not in us.
    <br>If we claim we have no sin at all - committing acts of sin - we are wrong.
    <br>If you go down, God tells His children not to sin, but He knows they are likely to do so.
    <br>Just like you said, sir, in one of your messages that it takes the maturity that comes from faith
    <br>to realise that our responsibility to God is a commitment and fellowship, rather than sacrifice.
    <br>If that is the case, what is the remedy?
    <br>Remedy - that is solution.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Since our place is still there and only the fellowship is broken, run to God and not from Him.
    <br>Run to God, confess your sin, and He is faithful and just to forgive.
    <br>Thank you, sir, for this wisdom.
    <br>Indeed, viewers, our earthly understanding must give way to spiritual enlightenment.
    <br>Sir, are you saying that a Christian can make a mistake or commit an error?
    <br>Nothing is too big for your salvation.
    <br>A Christian can make a mistake.
    <br>Because of their relationship with God, they know
    <br>they can immediately go to God over their sinful behaviour.
    <br>That is the meaning of relationship.
    <br>That is what makes us different from others.
    <br>It is true, sir.
    <br>I remember when you told us that sin can never be covered by our appearance, presence, prayers, tears;
    <br>it can only be removed by repentance.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>But the question I know viewers are asking is: Who then is a Christian?
    <br>Well, this is a good question.
    <br>If I may come down to people's level:
    <br>A Christian is someone who is walking with the Lord.
    <br>Allow me to stand up because I'm not comfortable here.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>A Christian is someone who is walking with the Lord.
    <br>Before you can walk with the Lord,
    <br>God's power must work through His Word and His Spirit to give birth to you.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>God's power must work through His Word and His Spirit to give birth to a Christian.
    <br>A Christian is someone who is lifting the load with God.
    <br>I am a Christian.
    <br>If I carry this, God is carrying it because His strength is my strength, His ability is my ability.
    <br>Everything about me is everything about God.
    <br>In Him I move, in Him I walk, in Him I laugh, in Him I greet, "Good Morning".
    <br>That is a Christian.
    <br>A Christian is someone who is facing persecution, trial with the Lord.
    <br>If you want to be a Christian, be a Christian - not just a Christian by Word, but a Christian by Spirit.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Not only must we have God's Word. In order to be a Christian, we must also have God's Spirit.
    <br>If you claim you have God's Word to be a Christian, without God's Spirit,
    <br>the challenges before you, the situation before you -
    <br>because it is a way of life; there must be challenges -
    <br>the persecution before you -
    <br>it is a way of life; there must be persecution -
    <br>will overwhelm you, will overpower you, without the Spirit.
    <br>It's not by power
    <br>It's not by might
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>Take note of that:
    <br>He never says, "By My Word."
    <br>-Yes, sir.
    <br>It says, "By My Spirit."
    <br>God is Spirit and His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and truth.
    <br>You see what is happening around today.
    <br>You see how people run helter-skelter just because of this, that, because of virus.
    <br>Fear of this, fear of that everywhere.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because we are not born of the Spirit and we say we are Christians.
    <br>Not only must we have God's Word in order to be a Christian; we must also have God's Spirit.
    <br>That's the challenge we are facing, sir.
    <br>That is the challenge.
    <br>That is also the challenge in the churches today.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>In the church of God this the challenge we are having.
    <br>This is an enormous challenge.
    <br>Speaking skills, ability to inspire...
    <br>Any other question?
    <br>From your parents?
    <br>We do have some more questions for you, sir.
    <br>This person says: Dear sir,
    <br>In 1 John 3:9, the Bible talks about sinless perfection.
    <br>I don't know if I can read that passage quickly.
    <br>Do everything you can do.
    <br>This person is saying that in 1 John 3:9, the Bible talks about sinless perfection.
    <br>And I will read this in the Bible quickly.
    <br>"Those who have been born into God's family do not make a practice of sinning, because God's life is in them.
    <br>So they can't keep on sinning, because they are children of God."
    <br>Take note of that; they can't keep on sinning.
    <br>You can't keep on running - it means, there will be a time to stop.
    <br>You can't keep on talking - it means, there will be a time for you to pause.
    <br>You can't keep on looking.
    <br>Try to understand your English; this is English language.
    <br>Not only must you have God's Word in order to be a Christian; you must also have God's Spirit.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>We must examine what we read because this Bible is not history.
    <br>When you are reading this Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You must be carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Not just... the grammar there, the grammar there.
    <br>What is the Bible saying?
    <br>The expression "Does not commit sin" does not mean they do not sin.
    <br>Take note of that - that is what they are saying there,
    <br>what they are saying here.
    <br>The Christian does not make sin his trademark,
    <br>does not make sin his business,
    <br>does not make sin his lifestyle.
    <br>This is what they are saying.
    <br>The Christian does not make sin his trademark.
    <br>The Christian does not make sin his business, his lifestyle.
    <br>The Christian does not live and walk in it
    <br>for His seed remains in him - that is faith.
    <br>I said last time that our faith may fail but not utterly.
    <br>Our faith may fail but not fall off.
    <br>This is what they are saying. Try to understand.
    <br>You are graduates; I'm the only one that is not a graduate here.
    <br>But I examine things.
    <br>You graduates, you have given me the English grammar but I need to examine what you are saying.
    <br>I'm not a graduate.
    <br>That is why I receive a lot of awards but I'm ashamed to attach it to my name
    <br>because what will I tell the world?
    <br>I don't know, I'm shy.
    <br>So, this is just the issue.
    <br>Any other question?
    <br>Yes, we do have one more question.
    <br>We wanted to thank you for clarifying the issue to us of Christians and sin
    <br>as the Bible says that anytime a Christian sins or attempts to do so,
    <br>the Holy Spirit provokes their conscience, prompts their conscience.
    <br>We thank you, sir.
    <br>Another question the viewers asked is: What is the life of a Christian all about?
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>What is the life of a Christian all about?
    <br>The whole being of any Christian is built on faith and love.
    <br>Faith brings the man to God, and love brings him to man.
    <br>I don't want to start telling you, "Faith is respecting Jesus, doing this, that" - no.
    <br>You have to be specific.
    <br>Viewers, try to understand what I'm saying.
    <br>Our life is built on faith and love.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>Faith brings the man to God, and love brings him to man.
    <br>Thank you, sir, for this wisdom.
    <br>Any other question?
    <br>Yes, sir. We have many but we will give you one more from one of our viewers.
    <br>This person said that:
    <br>Man of God, I always watch Emmanuel TV from Canada
    <br>and I've heard you saying, "The road to the Kingdom of God is not a bed of roses."
    <br>What can you explain further about this, sir?
    <br>It's not a bed of roses - you know what it means - thorns, scorpions - just name every foolish thing.
    <br>The Kingdom requires us to be in the midst of our enemies.
    <br>He who will not suffer this does not want to be of the Kingdom of Christ.
    <br>So, I hope you have finished with your questions.
    <br>I think our viewers...
    <br>All these questions seem to point to me!
    <br>There is a question viewers want to ask and they are just dancing around.
    <br>Why can't you ask me,
    <br>"T.B. Joshua, we want to know if you do wrong.
    <br>We want to know if you do wrong or make mistakes."
    <br>Well, capital YES!
    <br>My mistakes keep me looking deeper.
    <br>Mistakes taught me valuable lessons -
    <br>to pray more, dream of other ways that I might have ignored.
    <br>This reminds me of the case of Paul Apostle.
    <br>This was his case -
    <br>"To keep me humble, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from satan" - that is Paul.
    <br>Sometimes what we see as a disadvantage may turn into an advantage.
    <br>"Why me this? Why me that?"
    <br>If we receive so much comfort, shall we not receive some pain,
    <br>some tribulation that will serve to check our comfort
    <br>to pray the more, fast the more, increase our desire and determination for God?
    <br>As a Christian, what we see as error, a big mistake, God may sometimes allow it as a trial.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast 
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>It's real food for thought for our viewers.
    <br>You really made a value of that comfort when you face that situation, that challenge.
    <br>OK, any other question?
    <br>You have answered so many of our viewers' questions.
    <br>A lot of the questions they said had been burdening their hearts.
    <br>They shall be very happy.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
