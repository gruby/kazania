    <br>Stretch your hand. Father, we thank You.
    <br>Holy Ghost, we thank You.
    <br>Whatever foundation that is not of Jesus,
    <br>whatever foundation that is built on the foundation of demons,
    <br>begin to rebuke that demon now.
    <br>Shake the foundation.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to shake the foundation.
    <br>I shake the foundation - whatever foundation.
    <br>ANOINTING TO MOVE ON!!! Mass Prayer with Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Shake the foundation.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to shake the foundation.
    <br>Say: I shake the foundation, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>We are taking you back to the foundation.
    <br>'Foundation' means when you were very small.
    <br>You had no independence. Whatever they asked you to do, you did it.
    <br>I want you to open your lips.
    <br>Those foundations are not of God.
    <br>You want to disconnect yourself.
    <br>Say: You demon!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>I shake your foundation.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to shake the foundation, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>ANOINTING TO MOVE ON!!! Mass Prayer with Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You stranger! Out!
    <br>You demon! Out!
    <br>Your body is not the temple of demons.
    <br>I command that demon out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>ANOINTING TO MOVE ON!!! Mass Prayer with Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Right now, out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Watch your screen. That is the manifestation of the evil spirits.
    <br>As you continue to command every stranger out of your life, continue to watch your screen.
    <br>ANOINTING TO MOVE ON!!! Mass Prayer with Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to command them out.
    <br>ANOINTING TO MOVE ON!!! Mass Prayer with Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You stranger - the spirit of killing, stealing, out!
    <br>The cause of sickness and disease, out!
    <br>The cause of affliction, out!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to rebuke it.
    <br>Rebuke it.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>This body is under the influence of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Whatever that is not of God,
    <br>I command you, out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>ANOINTING TO MOVE ON!!! Mass Prayer with Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>You know those characters, attributes, funny behaviours and bad habits; they are not of God.
    <br>In your dreams, in your way, I command them out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Holy Ghost!
    <br>Receive the deliverance.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Receive the deliverance.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Begin to receive.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Are you on the sick bed?
    <br>Wherever you are.
    <br>In your fluids, blood, tendons, skin and in your bones.
    <br>In the name of Jesus. Never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When Jesus says you are healed, you are healed perpetually.
    <br>You are healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Are you facing hardship?
    <br>What is your problem?
    <br>In your business, finances.
    <br>Right now, receive that anointing.
    <br>Anointing to move on.
    <br>Move on!
    <br>Your business, begin to rise again! Amen.
    <br>Your finances, begin to rise again! Amen.
    <br>Rise again.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Right now, cover your home and everything that has to do with you with the blood of Jesus.
    <br>I cover my home with the blood of Jesus; I possess my possessions.
    <br>I cover my finances with the blood of Jesus; I possess my possession.
    <br>I cover my family with the blood of Jesus; I possess my possessions.
    <br>I cover my home with the blood of Jesus; I possess my possessions.
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You have not had a relationship with God, our Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Say after me:
    <br>Lord Jesus
    <br>I'm a sinner.
    <br>Come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul today.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>You are welcome to the family of God.
    <br>We love you. We pray for you. We pray with you. Thank you.
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>Holy Ghost, we thank You.
    <br>Salvation.
    <br>His Word abide in us and we abide in it.
    <br>Remember, better is not good enough; the best is yet to come.
    <br>Thank you.
