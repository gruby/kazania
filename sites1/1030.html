  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, speaking forth God's Word, armed with the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>the lame walk, captives are set free and healing comes to those
    <br>who are riddled with sickness and bound by disability.
    <br>And now witness true freedom in Christ as the Prophet encounters this man.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You look strange.
    <br>Come on, you look strange
    <br>There is a strange woman inside you.
    <br>You are a man, but you are a woman.
    <br>You are a man, you are a woman.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You were being raped.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>You have the spirit of woman inside you.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You keep fighting this spirit.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You know you're a man, but there is a spirit - a woman that is talking through you.
    <br>Yes, that is true, Man of God.
    <br>And when you move, you walk like a woman too.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You don't like it but that woman keeps talking,
    <br>keeps acting, keeps looking, keeps smiling, keeps looking, if I am right?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You are free! Come out!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>He is fighting a strange spirit and that spirit,
    <br>he knows he is a man but there is a woman living inside him.
    <br>The woman would be laughing, instead of him to laugh
    <br>but it is a woman's appearance that you would see.
    <br>When he moves, you would see a woman moving.
    <br>When he smiles, the woman smiles.
    <br>He knows that he is a man but there is a woman inside that is doing everything for him.
    <br>He is free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>It is a simple thing.
    <br>It's only that you recognise that spirit.
    <br>It's a spirit.
    <br>You can be a man but you see something entering you that acts like a woman,
    <br>but you know you are a man.
    <br>But when you smile, people admire you as a woman.
    <br>But you know you are a man.
    <br>It's a spirit; it's tormenting.
    <br>You are free. How do you feel now - tell me.
    <br>I feel relieved now that I am delivered.
    <br>- You feel relieved? 
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>That being that was talking to you, how do you feel?
    <br>Is it still appearing there?
    <br>I don't feel anything anymore.
    <br>You don't feel that being again?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Sit down there, let them loosen your hair.
    <br>Can somebody help me loosening the hair?
    <br>It's part of freedom. He can go and cut it later but he must be loosed immediately.
    <br>If I am not attending to this brother here, it would be difficult for me to attend to this woman.
    <br>Why? - Evil spirit is here and 
    <br>the work of evil spirit is this.
    <br>There is difference between evil spirit and the work of evil spirit.
    <br>You know that?
    <br>You know Holy Spirit gives birth to the Spirit of God.
    <br>You know that?
    <br>The oil you receive, anointing oil, you receive it from the Spirit of God, from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>He gives birth.
    <br>So in the same vein, this evil spirit has his own work.
    <br>His work is this sickness and disease.
    <br>It is not possible for any prophet to leave the evil spirit and now want to heal people.
    <br>Ok, satan is sitting down here.
    <br>Satan himself is sitting and he gives birth to all those evil spirits to go and do all sorts of things.
    <br>And you are now delivering evil spirit but satan is sitting down.
    <br>Does it make sense?
    <br>Satan would not allow it.
    <br>Even if he were to allow it, he would destroy you.
    <br>Oh, my brother. You are my friend - a very handsome boy.
    <br>Thank you. I will see you, okay?
    <br>- You're from where? 
    <br>- South Africa.
    <br>Okay, South Africa. Thank you.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Eugene Monama.
    <br>I'm from South Africa.
    <br>During last week's service, as the man of God was praying for everyone in the church,
    <br>he just came straight to me and then said that I had a spirit of a woman inside me
    <br>and that I was raped, which is true.
    <br>It all started at a very young age.
    <br>I was six by the time it started.
    <br>But then I didn't really pay much attention to it because I was very young at that time.
    <br>Until when I was 15; that is when I got my new phone.
    <br>Then I started browsing through the net and came across pornography.
    <br>But then the strange thing about it was that I was watching man to man pornography.
    <br>So it went on like that until when I was 18,
    <br>I was doing my first year by that time.
    <br>I was staying at the campus residence at that time so I had to move out.
    <br>I lied to my mum.
    <br>I told her that I was staying at the campus residence
    <br>whereas I moved out from that campus residence.
    <br>I rented a flat on campus.
    <br>When I was 18, that was when I created my Facebook account.
    <br>And then I also downloaded an application -
    <br>it's a dating site, where you interact with different men.
    <br>So I interacted with them, and then we would make some arrangements.
    <br>I met them, I slept with them.
    <br>I was the one to start the conversation.
    <br>I would just go through their Facebook accounts
    <br>and then start the conversation from there.
    <br>The type of clothes I wore - because when I was on campus, I was a different person.
    <br>When I was on campus, I wore different clothes.
    <br>I wouldn't wear this type of clothes.
    <br>I usually wore this type of clothes when I was at home.
    <br>Whenever I went to a clothing store, I would go to the ladies' department and buy female clothes.
    <br>Then again I would go to the gents' department to buy clothes
    <br>so that whenever I went home, I would be able to wear those clothes.
    <br>I was just being led on by that spirit.
    <br>So did your parents actually notice 
    <br>what was happening?
    <br>No.
    <br>Immediately after that spirit of woman entered me, I started going out to clubs, drinking.
    <br>When I was on campus, I had to walk like a female, but then...
    <br>Can you explain to us, so that people can learn,
    <br>how did you use to move or smile then like as a result of that spirit of woman?
    <br>Eugene Monama
    <br>Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>That is the brother just demonstrating in a nutshell
    <br>how he used to walk and move in a feminine manner that actually attracted fellow men to him.
    <br>The man of God said during his prophetic message last week Sunday
    <br>when the brother was being delivered that he had the spirit of woman
    <br>and as a result when he laughed, he laughed like a woman,
    <br>when he walked, he walked like a woman,
    <br>and that is what he has just demonstrated.
    <br>Okay, during 2015, as I was coming back from the club, I was drunk by that time,
    <br>I bumped into a guy on my way back to the flat.
    <br>He asked if I could come with him to his flat.
    <br>And then he lured me into a group of guys; that was when I was gang-raped.
    <br>So since then, what was happening in your life
    <br>ever since you went through that terrible experience?
    <br>Ever since that rape, everything just went from bad to worse.
    <br>And how did this problem affect your education
    <br>because you told us you were in university then.
    <br>How did that affect your studies?
    <br>During that time, I couldn't cope with my schoolwork, and I was so depressed.
    <br>So one of the psychologists prescribed some depression tablets for me.
    <br>So that means this problem affected you in many diverse ways,
    <br>to the extent that the brother said it affected his studies.
    <br>You can see him actually shedding tears of joy
    <br>because you can imagine what he must have gone through at that very tender age
    <br>when he was being
    <br> possessed with that kind of spirit.
    <br>But today we are rejoicing because Jesus Christ has taken away his past.
    <br>So all this happened all through your life.
    <br>But at what point did you know about The SCOAN and you decided to come?
    <br>It was my mum who introduced me to The SCOAN.
    <br>Really, I didn't know about this church until my mum introduced me to this church.
    <br>- So your mum actually told you to come?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Last week Sunday we saw how you were seated amongst the congregation,
    <br>and the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua came and laid hands on you.
    <br>Can you share with us, 
    <br>what was your experience on that Sunday?
    <br>I felt like that spirit was leaving me.
    <br>And we saw that after that deliverance, the man of God instructed that your hair should be loosed.
    <br>What was your feeling, your experience as that hair was being taken off?
    <br>I felt relieved, knowing that I was delivered from that spirit.
    <br>That is the brother we are 
    <br>seeing on the screen of the television.
    <br>We know that when Jesus Christ delivers us, He delivers us completely and effectually.
    <br>All that lifestyle he was living in the past as a result of that spirit of woman
    <br>he was possessed of that led him to meet with men like himself or put on a funny hairstyle,
    <br>immediately that spirit was removed, we can the hair been loosed
    <br>and the brother we are seeing right here in front of us,
    <br>we can see a perfectly normal, healthy brother.
    <br>To the glory of God.
    <br>So go ahead with your testimony.
    <br>Immediately after my deliverance, he demanded my hair to be removed.
    <br>Yeah, you can see.
    <br>So that is what we are seeing.
    <br>The person we are seeing right now, we cannot see that funny hairstyle again.
    <br>So how do you feel now, looking 
    <br>normal with your normal hair style?
    <br>How do you feel?
    <br>l feel relieved now.
    <br>So what are the changes you have seen or noticed in your life
    <br>ever since that deliverance last week Sunday?
    <br>Ever since the deliverance last Sunday, I deactivated my Facebook account.
    <br>I even changed my SIM card, so I'm no longer communicating with those people anymore.
    <br>{Oh! Hallelujah! Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>My advice to those, who are having the same spirit as I had, is
    <br>that in the book of Romans 2, the Bible says,
    <br>Don't copy the customs, the costumes or the behaviour of this world.
    <br>But rather you should allow God to transform you into a new person by changing the way you think.
    <br>Because I know that along the way, you are going to meet people who are going to deceive you
    <br>and tell you that you cannot change, you were born like that, which is not true.
    <br>You just have to invite God into your heart and let Him do the rest because you cannot do it on your own.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Eugene Monama.
    <br>I'm 25 years old. I'm from South Africa.
    <br>Thank you very much. Could 
    <br>you just share your testimony with us?
    <br>I'm here to give thanks to God for using Prophet TB Joshua to deliver me from the spirit
    <br>that made me have an affection for men like myself.
    <br>Since I've been delivered, I no longer 
    <br>have an affection for men like myself.
    <br>I thank God for delivering me from that spirit.
    <br>Amen, we thank God Almighty and we rejoice with you greatly.
    <br>Right now, the man of God in his usual kind gesture knows for sure
    <br>that you need to maintain your salvation and you also need something to live on.
    <br>The man of God Prophet TB Joshua alongside Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world,
    <br>said we should give you the sum of $1,000 to support you.
    <br>Eugene Receives A Gift Of 1,000 US Dollars From Prophet T. B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>I thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>all over the world for blessing me with this sum of $1000.
    <br>I appreciate it a lot; I didn't expect this.
    <br>May God continue to bless Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world.
    <br>We thank the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world
    <br>for supporting you with this sum of $1,000 to help you back to your country.
    <br>My advice for them is to stay with God and trust in God.
    <br>We thank the Lord Almighty for 
    <br>what He has done in your life.
    <br>We pray as you go and make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>your blessing, your breakthrough 
    <br>will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
