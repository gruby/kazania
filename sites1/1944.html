    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Good Morning!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This is the moment of reconciliation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have to reconcile yourself right now.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, whatever situation you are in, listen to me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am very sure that a grudge has opened the door to depression or whatever situation you are in.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Viewers, it is very important right now that you begin to reconcile yourself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ask the Lord to open your heart to His Spirit so that you will know God's opinion about yourself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Viewers all over the world, right now, let me speak to your situation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I speak to every situation you are in and I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Viewers, I believe you must have reconciled yourself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you have done this, the job is half done.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Once again, I repeat:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am very sure that a grudge has opened the door to the situation you are in.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Whatever situation you are in is as a result of a grudge you hold against a brother.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your spirit needs to be free to contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ask God to open your heart to His Spirit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Open my heart to Your Spirit, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, I speak to your situation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, I speak to your situation
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and I command that situation to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Once again:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Right now, begin to reconcile yourself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you need to do any restitution, do it quick
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>because your future, mission and goal is greater than whatever you are talking about.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Offence is a poison to the future
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and has opened the door to depression and the situation we are facing today.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If there is any situation you are facing, yes, it is not too far from this.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am very sure that a grudge has opened the door to depression, to whatever situation you are in.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, right now, begin to reconcile yourself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Reconcile yourself; this is the time.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You demon, you must obey!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I command you to leave my people!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In the name of Jesus!

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your prayer will not...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The only hindrance to your prayer is when you continue to hold a grudge against your neighbour.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>No argument.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It is only you that can reverse this.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>No demon can reverse this.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No demon can reverse my case; only you!"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes, you are delivered; Who delivered you?

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There is a brother on the gallery there.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You work in a hotel but suddenly, it is like you became one of them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is, you married a harlot.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your life is upside down.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You can't control yourself; you are on the gallery there.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have incurable gonorrhoea - a very bad disease that is worrying you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Right now, on the gallery.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My name is William Matthias.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am the one you prophesied about who married one harlot like that.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You did what?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I married one harlot.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Okay, you want to marry five? One is not enough?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>No.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I don't want to marry her any more.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Sense of reasoning - I pray that you will not have a problem.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>His sense of reasoning is gone; he cannot reason well now.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, don't worry; you and that harlot, I want to see you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, you went to a hotel to work - just to work and leave.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You now married one of them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Since that time, your life is destroyed.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let us pray for our nations, our countries.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Please pray for your nation; pray for your country.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Right now, commit your nation and leader into the hands of God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ask God to rescue your nation and deliver your nation from the spirit of corruption.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ask God to rescue your nation and deliver your nation from the spirit of idolatry.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ask God to rescue your nation and deliver your nation from misjudgement and misrule.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>YOU DEMON - YOU MUST OBEY!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name, we pray.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah - rejoice and give thanks to God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let us remember troubled nations and troubled continents.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There are some nations that are really in trouble - war, unrest - remember these countries in prayer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Special prayer for these nations - prayer!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>YOU DEMON - YOU MUST OBEY!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer

    <br>
    <br>They may rob you and insult you in whatever manner but they cannot take the grace of God from you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because that grace can only be given by God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, therefore, don't hold offence because of whom you are and what you stand for.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Do you know where you are going?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you know where you are going, you will not hold an offence against your brother.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you know where you are going, you will not hold an offence against your brother."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But if you don't know where you are going, your business is to hold offence and to take offence -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>little things overwhelm you and irritate you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Anything and everything can irritate you, embarrass you or overwhelm you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>when you don't know where you are going.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I know where I belong."

    <br>One thing you must know about the world:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Here are believers and here are others - there is one thing you must know about them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Whether they laugh or frown, they are an enemy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Love your enemy as yourself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>'The rest' means the battle - if they hit you, leave the rest for God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let God fight the battle.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you hit them back, God withdraws.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Any time they hit you and you hit back, God will withdraw.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But when they hit you and you leave it, you fold your hands, you leave the battle for God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God's battle is eternal.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Eternal life
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah.
