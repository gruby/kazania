  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Just as I want to dance, sing and smile, where would I start?
    <br>Should I start from smiling?
    <br>(Smiling)
    <br>Do you see it so genuine?
    <br>What next?
    <br>That should be the last.
    <br>If I dance, I would not be able to sing.
    <br>Which song do you want me to sing?
    <br>(Singing)
    <br>I was listening to that.
    <br>(Singing and dancing)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>We try to run but we are still just a baby before the Gospel of Christ.
    <br>Baby, like, kindergarten and nursery.
    <br>Because when you see what is happening - people are ignorant of the things of the Spirit.
    <br>You see them talking about the things of the Spirit, but they don't know what they are talking about.
    <br>The case of the Bible is not like that. We have taken the Bible as literature.
    <br>Literature is the letter; some say it is Scripture.
    <br>Your own scripture seems not to be inspired.
    <br>One fact that makes the Word of God unique is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Scripture can just be the letter if it is not inspired by the Spirit.
    <br>What are you reading? Which one is your Bible -
    <br>the Bible you consider as letter or the one inspired by the Spirit?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>The Bible demands the state of our heart before reading.
    <br>It's not like all sorts of other books.
    <br>You cannot hold grudges, pick up the Bible and begin to read.
    <br>When you are disturbed in your heart and you are picking up the Bible to read,
    <br>you cannot hear from God.
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>It is not literature, history or novels.
    <br>Literature may not demand the state of your heart.
    <br>You may be disturbed and read literature. You may be crying and read literature.
    <br>You may hold offence and read literature. You may hold unforgiveness and read literature.
    <br>Hatred...
    <br>But the Bible is the Scripture inspired by the Spirit and demands the state of your heart.
    <br>The question - what is the state of your heart?
    <br>Tell you neighbour, What is the state of your heart while reading the Bible?
    <br>What is the state of your heart while reading the Bible?
    <br>While carrying the Bible, what is the state of your heart?
    <br>The Bible demands the state of our heart.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Psalms 66:18:
    <br>"If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened."
    <br>When you have sympathy -
    <br>you conceal, keep pain of the past, unforgiveness, hatred, envy, jealousy -
    <br>and you are taking the Bible to read,
    <br>you are not reading the Bible I know but you are reading literature.
    <br>Don't forget, when you open the Bible and read, you are hearing God talk.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you open the Bible and read, you are hearing God talk".
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
    <br>Will you be able to hear God?
    <br>You cannot.
    <br>You will not hear God if you regard sin, keep the pain of the past, unforgiveness, hatred in your heart.
    <br>The Holy Bible demands the state of your heart before reading it.
    <br>I know this is the first time you are hearing this because it's too elementary, kindergarten.
    <br>But these are the things that we abandon and overlook.
    <br>Can you imagine where our problem is coming from?
    <br>We are facing the biggest challenge in our lives - ignorance of the things of the Spirit.
    <br>If I have an unforgiving spirit, pain of the past, envy and jealousy,
    <br>I have to get rid of these before opening the Bible
    <br>because when you open the Bible and read, you are hearing God talk.
    <br>How will you hear from God with envy in your heart?
    <br>Our heart is the communication point.
    <br>How will you hear from God with envy, jealousy, pain of the past, an unforgiving spirit?
    <br>You cannot hear from God because reading the Bible is hearing God talk.
    <br>Everyone here, no single one is out of this.
    <br>Everybody here.
    <br>Who then, is a Christian?
    <br>We are all religious people.
    <br>Prayer and Bible reading should always go together.
    <br>This means we must fill our prayer with Scripture.
    <br>Whatever you want to say in your prayer should come from the Scripture.
    <br>Not the one - "In the name of Jesus, that my enemy..."
    <br>What you say in your prayer, where do you get it from?
    <br>Prayer has a language; you must speak its language.
    <br>Prayer and Bible reading should always go together.
    <br>You must fill your prayer with Scripture - what you have read.
    <br>If you want it to be in line with the Holy Ghost, with God, you must fill your prayer with Scripture.
    <br>We don't know how to pray; the Holy Ghost helps us in our weakness.
    <br>What are we talking about?
    <br>We are saying that you have not been filling your prayer with Scripture.
    <br>We are saying that you have not been doing the right thing.
    <br>We are saying that you are reading the Bible as if you are reading literature.
    <br>We are saying that you are reading the Bible as if you are reading history.
    <br>This is what we are saying.
    <br>Great danger.
    <br>I can see why you are having nightmares.
    <br>I can see why you complain about how you are doing and how you are feeling.
    <br>One fact that makes the Word of God so unique and special
    <br>is the indwelling of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The thoughts of the Bible are from the Spirit.
    <br>It's not from our father, you or T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The language is from men but the thoughts of the Bible are from the Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The thoughts of the Bible are from the Spirit and the language is from men".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What are you saying?
    <br>Are you saying what the Holy Spirit is saying?
    <br>If the one preaching, teaching, praying, counselling is not in line with the Holy Ghost,
    <br>he is merely saying words, talking to the air
    <br>because the thoughts of the Bible are from the Spirit and the language is from men.
    <br>That is why you will not see me disturbing you with verses of the Bible,
    <br>"Open the book of Luke, pray... open the book of this".
    <br>It is just reference. The words are directly from the Spirit.
    <br>You must develop your relationship with the Holy Ghost by reading your Bible daily without grudges.
    <br>To develop your relationship with the Holy Ghost, you must read your Bible with a free spirit.
    <br>You must read your Bible with a free spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You must read your Bible with a free spirit.
    <br>If not, you are reading history.
    <br>You know these novels - James Hardley Chase and all others.
    <br>If the Word dominates your mouth, it will dominate your heart.
    <br>If the Word dominates your heart, it will influence your conduct and character.
    <br>You keep saying, "Why all this? I'm a Christian! No, no, no!"
    <br>because this Word has not influenced your character.
    <br>You say, "It is not possible for me! I have tried my best! I don't know why!"
    <br>When you are reading a novel - you are reading history!
    <br>I like your Bible because it's very small and very neat.
    <br>Oh my God. How old is this Bible?
    <br>I want to encourage you.
    <br>You must read your Bible slowly - because it is the wisdom of God - attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>There is no way you can read something slowly, attentively and repeatedly
    <br>under tension and pressure - it is not possible.
    <br>You can only do that when you are calm, not rough.
    <br>You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>The more you read, the more you will understand about yourself and this God who created you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The more you read slowly, attentively, repeatedly,
    <br>the more you understand about yourself and this God who created you".
    <br>Because you don't understand yourself; everyday you surprise, astonish yourself.
    <br>You suddenly wake up in the morning and see blood.
    <br>You suddenly wake up in the morning and realise you bedwetted.
    <br>You suddenly wake up in the morning and cannot stand up.
    <br>You suddenly wake up in the morning and cannot open your mouth.
    <br>You suddenly wake up in the morning and they have to carry you to the hospital.
    <br>You suddenly wake up in the morning (and start panting).
    <br>You don't understand yourself.
    <br>When we start praying now, you will start saying, "I have three powers".
    <br>By the time they have finished with your deliverance, you will say, "I don't know what I was saying".
    <br>This is because you don't understand yourself.
    <br>Say, "I don't understand myself".
    <br>Again.
    <br>"I don't understand myself."
    <br>If you don't understand yourself, what will you understand?
    <br>Charity begins at home.
    <br>Read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>The more you read, the more you understand about yourself and this God who created you.
    <br>If you don't understand yourself, how will you understand your Creator?
    <br>Each time you move to a frightening place, like a beach -
    <br>you see the beach being rough - you will say, "God is great!"
    <br>When you hear thunder, you say, "God is great!"
    <br>You don't understand yourself.
    <br>You just live by imagination; you don't know whether you will see tomorrow.
    <br>I have seen many of your friends and colleagues -
    <br>when you visit their funeral, the stories - oh my God!
    <br>If they had known they were about to die, they would have made proper arrangements.
    <br>Someone would say, "Hello, we will see each other tomorrow".
    <br>The next day you learn that he is in the grave.
    <br>Don't forget our lives are static - motionless, stagnant.
    <br>Remember, no state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with God.
    <br>That is why people like me can be here today.
    <br>You know the many efforts people have made to destroy this ministry.
    <br>You know the many efforts people have made to silence this ministry.
    <br>But GOD refused.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with God".
    <br>You just need to discover whom you are and your real value.
    <br>You don't know your value.
    <br>Suddenly, you kneel down for someone to pray for you
    <br>whereas you are better than the person praying for you.
    <br>He would be saying, "I rebuke you, in Jesus' name! I bless you!"
    <br>And you don't know that you are supposed to be the one to pray for him.
    <br>You are just like that; you don't know about yourself.
    <br>You just go down on your knees, "Oga, pray for me!"
    <br>Oga will now say, "Jesus Christ!"
    <br>Whereas you are supposed to be the one to pray for this oga, and not oga to pray for you.
    <br>It is because you don't know whom you are and your real value.
    <br>Many who are supposed to be in the palace are on the street.
    <br>Many are doing someone else's job.
    <br>Many marry someone else's wife or husband.
    <br>Discover whom you are and your real value.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Discover whom you are and your real value.
    <br>When you find yourself tired and you don't know what to do, you have now turned to a copy.
    <br>Suddenly you look at someone, "Ah, I like this attire!" - you wear it.
    <br>"I like this business!" - you abandon your business.
    <br>"I like going to this country!" - you abandon going to the country you were going to before.
    <br>Get interested in God's plan.
    <br>I know some of our members who for many years don't have any assignment to do in this church.
    <br>All they do is to come on Sundays and worship; they believe so much in their dirty money.
    <br>Money is dirty. Where did you get the money?
    <br>Out of the money you are bringing, where did you get it from?
    <br>You think that this money can pave the way for you. No!
    <br>Our elderly women are the ones cleaning the church and the seats for you.
    <br>You keep on coming to the church, and after service, they would be the ones to clean the benches.
    <br>Get interested in His plans, projects.
    <br>God's opinion of yourself and others is very important but you don't know.
    <br>What is God's opinion about you?
    <br>You cannot know God's opinion about others and about me.
    <br>That is why, when you leave from here, you will tell others,
    <br>"Ah, this is what happened; this is what the man said!"
    <br>You need someone to confirm who T.B. Joshua is to you.
    <br>This is why we are being deceived.
    <br>Someone needs to tell you, "Yes, he is a man of God; the message is good.
    <br>Ah, the hand is shaking! I don't understand that one!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with God because our lives are static.
    <br>There are many who were millionaires yesterday, but today, they have nothing. They are here.
    <br>There are many who were poor yesterday, but today, they are rich.
    <br>There are many who had good health yesterday, buy today, they are sick.
    <br>Our lives are static - lifeless, unpredictable.
    <br>This is not the promise of God. They are new every morning.
    <br>Get interested in His plan.
    <br>What is God's plan? What is God's project? Are you involved?
    <br>You are involved in many projects you are doing. Which one is God's project?
    <br>Which of these projects you are involved in is God's project?
    <br>In your ministry, wherever you worship, living church -
    <br>find one day in a week and join the sanitation department - people cleaning the seats -
    <br>to tell the Lord that, "Here I am, tame me, change me.
    <br>I want to learn at Your feet, I want to sit at Your feet".
    <br>In your ministry.
    <br>If you are high over there, come down.
    <br>Look at yourself - you are sitting now.
    <br>You don't know the person you are sitting with.
    <br>Whether he is a millionaire or average.
    <br>But you don't mind; you just look for a seat.
    <br>But out there, you want to sit where you sit, where your class and status sit.
    <br>But here, you see that everyone is just looking for a seat.
    <br>You don't mind whether the next person is rich, a housemaid, gardener, cleaner.
    <br>You don't mind; you just want to sit and listen to the Word of God.
    <br>This is the way it should be.
    <br>When you want to work in the house of God too, don't look for a job of your status.
    <br>When the doors are opened, everybody wants to sit down;
    <br>you don't want to know who sits beside you.
    <br>You would be very surprised that the person beside you is a gardener, driver outside.
    <br>But out there, you sit with your level, status, and class.
    <br>That is the Kingdom of God for you.
    <br>Don't forget the Word of God is not literature.
    <br>When you are reading the Word of God, you are reading the Holy Spirit, not history.
    <br>When you are reading the Bible, you are reading the Holy Ghost.
    <br>It demands the state of your heart.
    <br>The state of your heart must be at its best to read
    <br>because when you open the Bible and read, you are hearing God talk.
    <br>The Word of God is a tool in the hands of the Holy Ghost to give you peace, healing.
    <br>It is a tool to give you deliverance and salvation.
    <br>The Word of God is a tool in the hands of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Use me Lord
    <br>As a vessel
    <br>Use me Lord
    <br>As a vessel unto honour
    <br>Use me Lord
    <br>Use me Lord
    <br>As a vessel
    <br>Use me Lord
    <br>As a vessel unto honour
    <br>Use me Lord
    <br>It is time you must work with God's projects.
    <br>Get interested in His plan to discover whom you are and your real value.
    <br>The ministry where you worship - don't leave it; it is your second home.
    <br>Take it as your home.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning, you clean your floor, car, window.
    <br>You have people doing that for you.
    <br>But in the house of God, in a week, you must find a day and join people to clean the floor
    <br>and take care of the church premises.
    <br>Don't leave this for money.
    <br>Money's journey is far; you don't know where it's coming from.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Be ready to answer my question.
    <br>A few minutes.
    <br>How have you been reading your Bible in the past?
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Before understanding your teachings, I was reading my Bible without looking to understand God's heart,
    <br>to have the best understanding of God's heart.
    <br>I have come to understand that if I want to do so,
    <br>the first step is to repent and have a pure heart.
    <br>The second step is to be humble because when I am humble, then I can be in the presence of God.
    <br>This means, if I am not humble, then it is nothing of importance.
    <br>The third part is to be sincere with God.
    <br>Thank you. Clap for him.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You have the opportunity to preach the Word of God.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>You are just preaching the Word of God, not even trying to answer my question directly.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Ok, can somebody tell us - what are you going to do with this message?
    <br>From now on I will read my Bible slowly, attentively, repeatedly, and I will be in tune with God's Word.
    <br>How will you be in tune with God's Word?
    <br>I will not hold grudges, offence, and envy towards anybody.
    <br>Thank you. Did you listen to that?
    <br>I will be pure in my heart.
    <br>That is, read the Bible with forgiveness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Read the Bible with forgiveness.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Read the Bible with forgiveness.
    <br>Again.
    <br>Read the Bible with forgiveness.
    <br>The reading of the Bible demands for the state of your heart, a free spirit.
    <br>Thank you. Clap for him.
    <br>Any other? Come on.
    <br>I must be honest.
    <br>Before now, I have not been reading the Bible in accordance with the teachings of today.
    <br>The teachings of today have enlightened me.
    <br>There are certain things I have learned today that I must apply in the process of reading the Bible
    <br>so that I can receive pure communication with God
    <br>because reading the Bible is communication with God.
    <br>In line with His Word - as you have said - it will make us get inspiration from God to do His work.
    <br>Clap for him. Thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much. Thank you, sir.
    <br>Honestly, let me confess.
    <br>In the past, I wanted to cover more pages of the Bible.
    <br>For instance, if I took the book of Esther, I wanted to read all.
    <br>So I read it, just as I would read other books.
    <br>But because of the message this morning, I will take my time
    <br>and read the Bible slowly, attentively, and repeatedly.
    <br>The second lesson is that in my church, I didn't use to work there.
    <br>But because of this message, I will visit my church and work there.
    <br>Clap for him. I am happy you mentioned that.
    <br>You need to work there.
    <br>Now that you have decided to look for an assignment God wants for you to do in the church,
    <br>how will you approach this?
    <br>I used to occupy myself with the work I do, but because of the message I heard this morning,
    <br>I will make time within a week.
    <br>I said, how will you approach this. In what way will you approach what you want to do in the church?
    <br>I will now sit, restructure my time, take a day within the week.
    <br>Who owns your time?
    <br>God.
    <br>You want to wrestle time with God?
    <br>No, please.
    <br>This is what you are saying.
    <br>So, I am asking you how you will approach this.
    <br>I will take a day to visit the church and get involved in any work which is going on.
    <br>Don't go and meet your leader, pastor, founder, that you want to work in the church; that is pride.
    <br>Your leader or pastor should not choose what to do for you.
    <br>You know where your shortcoming and weakness lie.
    <br>And the weakness of everyone here is pride.
    <br>We need to humble ourselves.
    <br>We are too proud, that is why we believe so much in money.
    <br>Money answers everything.That is the voice of pride.
    <br>Go and join people in the church, work in the department where humility can come,
    <br>where you can be humble.
    <br>Ok? That is the area you should look into.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God. Thank you so much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Pride is our problem. That is why we believe so much in money.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Pride is our problem, that is why we believe so much in money".
    <br>There is nothing money cannot do for you.
    <br>You believe money can stop you from coming to church.
    <br>If money wants you to come to church, you will come.
    <br>If money does not want you to come to church, you will not come.
    <br>If money wants you to fall sick, you will fall sick.
    <br>If money wants you to be happy, you will be happy.
    <br>Wherever money asks you to go to, you will go.
    <br>When you speak, one can hear the voice of money.
    <br>When you walk, one can see the traces of money.
    <br>Even your dress...
    <br>That will give you an opportunity and access to know more about your ministry
    <br>when you become part of the working staff.
    <br>Don't go and meet your general overseer that you want to work.
    <br>What do you want him to say?
    <br>There are many departments in your ministry.
    <br>It is not the Spirit that cleans the floor
    <br>and it is not the Spirit that will pick up the plastics and everything.
    <br>Look at - camera, please come forward and capture the plastics.
    <br>There are thousands of them!
    <br>Someone will move round to pick them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A lot. Continue to capture them. You will see a lot.
    <br>Not only one. Move around.
    <br>I will give you two minutes. Can you see? All of these have been abandoned.
    <br>By the time we say the grace, they will abandon everything.
    <br>Are you giving them to drink it or to go and sell them?
    <br>Church is a family; the ministry of God is a family.
    <br>That is why in the olden days, 99% of ministries were called family church.
    <br>But today, the opposite is the case.
    <br>You clean your windows at home
    <br>but someone else will clean the windows in your church.
    <br>You sweep the floor in your home.
    <br>In your church, someone else will sweep the floor.
    <br>Get interested in His plan.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>What I have learned today is that I should let the Word of God dominate my heart,
    <br>and when it dominates my heart, it will dominate my mouth and influence my character.
    <br>Through reading the Bible and continuous meditation, it will dominate my heart.
    <br>And it must be read with forgiveness, a free spirit.
    <br>You must also use the Word you are reading in your prayer.
    <br>Thank you, brother. God bless you.
    <br>You can give it to our mummy here.
    <br>According to the teachings of the prophet this morning, I have learned
    <br>that we have to read our Bible slowly, repeatedly, and attentively.
    <br>I was not doing that; I would read my Bible whenever I wanted to.
    <br>I didn't pray according to the Scripture.
    <br>I would read from Monday to Thursday and finish the Bible as if I am reading a novel.
    <br>But today, I have learned that I have to read it according to the three points he described.
    <br>I should also have interest in God's project, which I do not have because I am a church goer.
    <br>I go to church, sit down, and go back home as soon as the church service finishes.
    <br>Clap for her. Did you listen to that?
    <br>She is educating us.
    <br>She is a church goer and would go home immediately after the church service finishes,
    <br>believing that her tithes and offerings (are enough).
    <br>What kind of...?
    <br>Many times, they would ask, "Those who know how to do certain things in church, join us".
    <br>But I would just slip away and go.
    <br>Tell us more; we want to learn.
    <br>So, it's as if the Prophet was talking to me directly; I was touched.
    <br>I have to direct myself and not wait for my elders in church to tell me what to do.
    <br>Let me just join any group I can.
    <br>Join the group that will reshape your character.
    <br>Don't join a group because those of your status and class are joining it.
    <br>Join a group of people you have nothing to do with out there.
    <br>Have something to do with them in the church.
    <br>People you don't have anything to do with.
    <br>Look for the group they belong to and join it.
    <br>People that are below you, your class - join that group in the church to work in.
    <br>We should not carry the association we have out there into the church.
    <br>This is what is affecting churches today.
    <br>We take the association we have outside and bring it into the church.
    <br>When you see the group of people in the church, they are of the same association, class out there.
    <br>That will not help us.
    <br>To help our character, we need someone we can learn from -
    <br>someone who has what we do not have, not someone who has what we have.
    <br>You would have nothing to learn from them.
    <br>You are because I am; I am because you are.
    <br>Where you are weak, I am strong; where you are strong, I am weak.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I thank God for this opportunity.
    <br>I have always heard that we must forgive others, and not hold grudges while praying.
    <br>But most times, I pray holding grudges and unforgiveness,
    <br>believing that God would show me mercy.
    <br>But I thank God for this privilege that the man of God has emphasised the need to pray only
    <br>when you spirit is in tune with God.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>This working in the house of God - so there is an area we need to add.
    <br>When you are going, you have to take your children along.
    <br>They must join you.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>I remember, in those days - blessed memory of my mum -
    <br>when my mum was going to church on Saturday and I was not going to school,
    <br>she would make sure I ate the food in the afternoon in the church
    <br>because she had a duty to perform in the church.
    <br>Because of food, I had to follow.
    <br>She would carry the food and say, "Meet me".
    <br>I used to play football but I had to cancel it and follow her because I needed to eat.
    <br>Our young people, whatever they need, whatever we need to do to bring them close -
    <br>we have to do every proper thing to bring them close.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>...to entice them and bring them to God.
    <br>So that when they are mature, they will understand what you were trying to do for them.
    <br>But at a certain age, we have to use our human effort to drag them close to God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Like I have said, make sure you join people that are below you;
    <br>the department they belong to - join that department.
    <br>Don't go to the church and join your class out there, what they are doing in the church.
    <br>Thank you, madam. God bless you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I learnt that my prayers must be filled with what I studied in the Bible.
    <br>If I read the Bible by that means, any time I pray,
    <br>the Holy Spirit would direct me to a particular part of the Bible.
    <br>because the Bible has a Scripture for every circumstance of life.
    <br>And we can't read it just like we read our poems.
    <br>If you read it with the guidance of the Holy Spirit, any time you are praying about an issue,
    <br>the Holy Spirit will direct you to a particular Scripture that you need to use to sort an issue out.
    <br>That is what I have learnt.
    <br>Secondly, I have learned to be concerned with God's projects.
    <br>The more you concern yourself with God's projects, the more God will be concerned with your projects.
    <br>Thank you. The world is demanding so much but what we are demanding is in the Bible.
    <br>Like what I was saying - in those days, when I was very little, I used to follow my mummy.
    <br>My mummy was one of the people that used to sweep the floor and clean the seats of the church.
    <br>Anytime she was cleaning the seats and sweeping the floor, her mouth would be saying something.
    <br>I don't know what she was saying.
    <br>I realised she would be murmuring and talking.
    <br>One day, I said, "Mummy, what are you saying? You would be talking when you are cleaning".
    <br>She said, "Ah, I am telling God, 'As I am cleaning Your house, clean my life'".
    <br>My mum would clean the floor and seats and she would be going.
    <br>Sometimes after she had talked and talked, she would begin to sing praise.
    <br>Then, I would say, "Mummy, what do you normally say because when I talk to you,
    <br>you would do not reply me. You keep talking to yourself. We don't know what you are saying".
    <br>She said, "Ah, I am telling God, 'As I am cleaning Your house, cleanse my life, my future,
    <br>my career and my children'".
    <br>I think I am one of the people God has given to.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She said, "As am cleaning Your house, sweeping the floor, clean my family, future, and children".
    <br>Please, get interested in God's plan.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>It is time to pray.
    <br>You don't have time to pray, whereas prayer should be part of your way of life.
    <br>Whenever you are in the church, whatever you are doing at that moment,
    <br>keep on praying.
    <br>Whatever has come into your heart to do, God will now enlarge your coast.
    <br>You find yourself becoming so abundant in what you are doing.
    <br>I think this message today is a Spirit-filled message for all of us in the church.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I am guilty of all of it.
    <br>I go to church with pride,
    <br>and I feel giving my dirty money is what it is all about when worshipping God.
    <br>Clap for my brother.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Can you see humility?
    <br>He said, we go to church with pride, give our dirty money, and say we are supporting the church.
    <br>If you are supporting your church with money, what is the position of that church now?
    <br>Man of God, this is a message my pastor has always been talking about.
    <br>That we should try to do something in the house of God, and it would bless us and our families.
    <br>This message - if I have my way - I would love it to be preached in my church
    <br>so that people would know what it means to worship God.
    <br>We should not be church goers.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>If you do something in the house of God with all your heart,
    <br>you are doing it for your generation and for your family.
    <br>I told you about the case with my mum.
    <br>In those days, when I was little, I would follow my mum.
    <br>Mummy was like forcing me with food.
    <br>Mummy would be murmuring (whilst cleaning), and later she would start singing.
    <br>I would say, "Mummy!" She would not be answering me.
    <br>I would ask, "What are you saying? Anytime you are cleaning the benches,
    <br>sweeping the floor, what do you usually say? You are always busy murmuring.
    <br>I would always see your mouth moving".
    <br>She would say, "Ah, what I am saying, my little one - God should clean my life, my children.
    <br>'I am cleaning Your house, Lord, clean...'".
    <br>But today, I can see indeed...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Go to the church and join those who are not of your class,
    <br>where you become a stranger among them. It is to humble you.
    <br>This is what God wants.
    <br>Thank you, sir, for your education.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Thank you. Did you listen to our brother?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are many things you can do.
    <br>There are many departments to join.
    <br>If we say we are supporting our church, what is the position of the church today in the world?
    <br>I am really touched with today's message.
    <br>I am a person that keeps grudges.
    <br>I have been holding a grudge before coming to this place.
    <br>With the grudge I am holding, if I had not heard your message,
    <br>and read my Bible, I would have just wasted my time.
    <br>Before coming here, my father slapped me for no reason, and the grudge is in my heart.
    <br>Because of what you have just preached, I have to leave that grudge
    <br>and develop the habit of doing away with grudge,
    <br>so that the indwelling Spirit of God will come to me.
    <br>If I don't do that, the Spirit of God will not come to me.
    <br>And I cannot read the Bible slowly, attentively, and repeatedly...
    <br>...when you are disturbed.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>So I am very happy for receiving this message.
    <br>I have to forgive my father so that I can move forward.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>You say, you want people to do good all the time
    <br>and you don't know that this life is two-sided - good and bad.
    <br>You should be expecting bad, good, bad, good.
    <br>You need more of these challenges to strengthen you to look proper and focused.
    <br>You need more of slap, persecution.
    <br>You have not yet arrived.
    <br>This is the time you should be expecting persecution.
    <br>People will embarrass you.
    <br>That will help you to give yourself to prayer.
    <br>The more you are embarrassed, the more you give yourself to prayer.
    <br>I told you the last time that our troubles help us to maintain our union with God.
    <br>I am happy to hear from my father here, that he was unjustly slapped.
    <br>I think it's good for us, for our strength.
    <br>Most especially for those of us that are striving to get to a certain position
    <br>and those of us that are yearning to grow in God.
    <br>We should be expecting this.
    <br>Take your time to read and study the life of T.B. Joshua - my antecedents.
    <br>When you look at my antecedents,
    <br>you will see that I have more degree in persecution than praise.
    <br>I am a professor when it comes to persecution but I am just a first degree holder in praise.
    <br>But I am not expecting praise.
    <br>I am not expecting praise because my reward is over there.
    <br>Thank you. I am happy with this message.
    <br>When you leave from here today, no matter how big or little your ministry is..
    <br>Some of us are coming from a very small church.
    <br>It is good! It is not the size of the ministry that determines its strength.
    <br>The strength of a ministry is not in its large population, branches all over
    <br>or being the biggest church in the world; the strength does not lie there.
    <br>You can see just two members in a church
    <br>that is more connected to God than the biggest or largest church.
    <br>The strength of the ministry is the relationship of the ministry to God;
    <br>it is not the population or crowd, fame or popularity.
    <br>That is not the strength of the ministry.
    <br>Anything can attract a crowd.
    <br>People in the world today go by feelings - what they see and hear.
    <br>So, even if your ministry is litle - just a few members - that is good for you.
    <br>Join them and help them in whatever they are cleaning in the church.
    <br>Find time one day in a week and do it.
    <br>Don't meet your general overseer.
    <br>Just meet the department concerned and tell them, "Yes, I want to join".
    <br>With all your heart.
    <br>That will be the day of your fasting.
    <br>You can choose that as a day of fasting.
    <br>When you are going there with fasting, your children too have to follow you,
    <br>just like my mummy was carrying me all the time.
    <br>See me today.
