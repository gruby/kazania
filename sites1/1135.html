  <p>    
    <br>I was born and raised in Ohio.
    <br>When I was three years old, my father died in a semi accident.
    <br>He was hit by a semi truck coming home from work one night.
    <br>After that, there was a lot of hardship and a lot of struggle.
    <br>There were days we were not sure if we were going to eat or not.
    <br>In fourth grade, teachers told my mum that I was too hyper and I needed to be on medication.
    <br>I was then put on medication.
    <br>As the years went on, I was still depressed, even though I was on medication.
    <br>I started drinking and taking drugs.
    <br>And then, fast forward, after college - few months after I had graduated -
    <br>I tried to take my life by taking a bottle and a half of pills.
    <br>One night, I was just feeling so low, broken; my girlfriend at the time had just broken up with me.
    <br>I had just lost my job and was feeling so low.
    <br>I just felt like there was no reason for me to be alive.
    <br>So, I took a bottle and a half of pills and drank a bunch of alcohol.
    <br>Then, I drove to my friend's house.
    <br>I don't even remember driving there.
    <br>It was a miracle that I even made it to my friend's house.
    <br>In the middle of the night, I woke up and remembered that I had taken those pills.
    <br>I tried to stand up and go to the bathroom to throw up the pills
    <br>but my legs were numb from the effects of the medication.
    <br>I couldn't stand up, so I had to crawl to the bathroom.
    <br>When I got to the bathroom, I tried to throw up the pills.
    <br>That is the last thing I remember because I blacked out and went into a seizure.
    <br>The next thing I know is that I woke up in an emergency room.
    <br>I literally thought it was a dream.
    <br>After I got out of the hospital, I was still drinking and feeling depressed.
    <br>Then, I met an evangelist from The SCOAN.
    <br>She gave me a bottle of the New Morning Water by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When I got home, I began to minister it to myself,
    <br>began to apply it to myself everyday, believing God for healing and deliverance.
    <br>And I got that healing.
    <br>A couple of months later, I was able to throw out all the pills.
    <br>It's been almost six years now that I have taken medication.
    <br>Now, I feel free and good.
    <br>I used to be depressed and suicidal.
    <br>Now, I work full time for the Emmanuel TV USA team and we work with all kinds of kids
    <br>that grew up in hardship just like I did.
    <br>We feed the homeless, help the elderly, and do all kinds of great things.
    <br>I am just so thankful and grateful that God used Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to bring the New Morning Water into my life and heal and deliver me.
    <br>If God can do it for me, He can do it for you.
    <br>This INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY Will Touch Your Heart!!!
