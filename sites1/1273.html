  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let someone say:
    <br>"Send your power on me!"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, welcome to the presence  of Jesus".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, Happy New Year in advance".
    <br>Say, "I am in His presence.
    <br>In His presence, there is fullness of love.
    <br>In His presence, fullness of power".
    <br>Let someone say, "Power - glory.
    <br>Glory - power!"
    <br>Give thanks to Jesus, give thanks to Him.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Have your seat!
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, welcome to the presence of Jesus".
    <br>I don't know what you have been through this year.
    <br>But all I know is something new is about to happen.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>It is something that can turn your life around.
    <br>Say, "Jesus loves me.
    <br>God loves me just as He loves any of His children".
    <br>Yes, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves you.
    <br>Never doubt the love of God in your life.
    <br>The Bible says that we have two loves - human love and God's love.
    <br>But human love is but a shadow of God's love.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why?
    <br>Human love is conditional; God's love is unconditional.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Love cannot exist without relationship.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because love can only be manifested where there is an object to be loved.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God wanted a love relationship so He created Adam.
    <br>When Adam sinned, that relationship was broken.
    <br>But the Bible says, God so loved the world that He planted His best seed, Jesus Christ,
    <br>to produce a family and today, millions are born again through this best seed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This shows, this indicates that love is the golden thread that links God's creation.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, love is the golden thread that links God's creation. Let love lead".
    <br>It brings us to our message this morning: AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP".
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Matthew.
    <br>Jesus says, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy'.
    <br>But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you,
    <br>and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you,
    <br>that you may be sons of your Father in Heaven;
    <br>for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good,
    <br>and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
    <br>Therefore, you shall be perfect, just as your Father in Heaven is perfect."
    <br>Let someone say, "AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIP".
    <br>We are here for an extraordinary relationship.
    <br>An extraordinary relationship does not begin with a love for people.
    <br>It begins with a love for God and that love overflows to people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God's love is first love. Through His love, we love.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "There is no love without relationship".
    <br>Relationship means cooperation - where the people involved in that relationship
    <br>benefit or gain from each other.
    <br>We are one another's strength.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A harmonious relationship - be it in your business, be it in your marriage -
    <br>a harmonious relationship is all about beneficial cooperation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Beneficial cooperation means a symbiotic, a reciprocal relationship
    <br>based on the principle of mutual giving and receiving.
    <br>This is the relationship approved by God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How can we achieve this today?
    <br>The man of God said that we must set aside our differences
    <br>to bring about cooperation and relationship among us.
    <br>We must set aside our differences to bring about what the other person lacks.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am because you are, you are because I am".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, there is no such thing as a perfect relationship".
    <br>There is no perfect relationship because perfection eludes us all; we all hurt somewhere.
    <br>That is why today, many relationships are under repair because we lack love.
    <br>Today, as we are sitting, many relationships are under repair because we lack love.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is no relationship without challenges.
    <br>God never promised that there would be no more trouble but He promised to see you through.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>For a relationship to come to stay, for a relationship to be stable,
    <br>it must go through thick and thin.
    <br>I mean, it must go through many experiences - both positive and negative.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because personnel improvement and fulfillment comes from the continual process
    <br>of learning from both positive and negative experiences.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When challenges come, don't break.
    <br>Challenges force us to look inward and to discover
    <br>and to come up with the result that nobody knows you as you know yourself.
    <br>Look at every successful relationship you see today -
    <br>be it in their business, be it in their marriage -
    <br>you will see how much pain, how much trouble they underwent
    <br>before they came to a successful relationship.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Challenges strengthen our relationship".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't give up. Challenges strengthen our relationship".
    <br>That why we need to know this.
    <br>Don't break any relationship because of challenges.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, I am ready for an extraordinary relationship this morning.
    <br>I am ready for a new dawn in my relationship, in my marriage, in my life".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't reject anyone because of today.
    <br>Don't reject him because of today.
    <br>Don't reject her because of today.
    <br>Don't reject them because of today".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why?
    <br>Today, we lose friends because of differences.
    <br>Relationships break beyond repair because of life's challenges.
    <br>Don't allow weakness and confrontation to tear your relationship down or to pull you apart.
    <br>Rather, see that challenge as a means to come closer to God, to come closer together,
    <br>to be prepared for victory because victory is yours, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Relationships break today because of differences and the uniqueness of the participants.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Relationships break because of unacknowledged and unrecognized differences
    <br>in the people involved in that relationship.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, our differences make us unique.
    <br>Your difference makes you unique".
    <br>It makes you unique; it is a feature that must be recognized on each person.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We must accept the differences in our personalities and the natural gift we are endowed with.
    <br>This is what we call beneficial cooperation.
    <br>Say, "I am because you are, you are because I am".
    <br>This feature must be recognized so that relationship can stand,
    <br>that relationship can be permanent, can endure.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't reject anyone because of today.
    <br>Where you are strong, I am weak; where I am weak, you are strong.
    <br>We are one another's strength".
    <br>If you reject anyone because of his weakness, you reject his strength.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you know the weakness of your friend, help him, instead of criticizing or rejecting him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We must recognize this in order to have the victory.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, a New Year is coming".
    <br>What is the way out?
    <br>There is no better way to celebrate the incoming year
    <br>than to reprogramme ourselves for an extraordinary relationship.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you ready for that?
    <br>An ordinary relationship can become an extraordinary relationship by looking up to Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, look up to Jesus".
    <br>No matter what you are passing through now - be it in your marriage, be it in your business -
    <br>look up to Jesus; He is the Restorer and the Repairer.
    <br>An ordinary relationship can become extraordinary by looking up to Jesus.
    <br>Remember, Jesus forgave those who mocked Him and even killed Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you ready to build that new relationship? Are you ready?"
    <br>The Bible says in the Book of Galatians 6:1 that there is a way out.
    <br>First and foremost, we must learn the guiding principle to maintain a successful relationship.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't reject anyone on account of today because tomorrow is mystery".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Mystery means unknowable, secret, hidden.
    <br>Mystery means divine truth, divine revelation.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't break relationships beyond repair because of today
    <br>because the person who is a thorn in your flesh today can be your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't break any relationship beyond repair because of today
    <br>because the person who is a thorn to your flesh today can be your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>A broken person can be arranged for a seat of power
    <br>A broken person can be prepared for the throne, can be a leader tomorrow.
    <br>The person who is bad today can be the best tomorrow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, an extraordinary relationship does not just happen, it is built".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Building that extraordinary relationship requires a new approach because a new year is coming.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My brothers, as we said: There is no better way to celebrate this incoming year
    <br>than to programme yourself for an extraordinary relationship.
    <br>The Bible says in Galatians 6:1, there must be forgiveness because no relationship is perfect.
    <br>There must be forgiveness because no one is perfect on this earth.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Forgiveness offers us today the opportunity to reshape our relationship for the best which is yet to come.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, forgiveness today offers me the opportunity
    <br>to reshape my relationship for the best which is yet to come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Misunderstanding in relationship leads to greater understanding when Jesus is involved.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Forgiveness strikes the root of all pain.
    <br>Forgiveness paves the way for a harmonious relationship even with your enemy".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus said that when you love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you,
    <br>this releases you from the destructive emotions of anger, bitterness and revenge against others.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the person most hurt by unforgiveness is you".
    <br>Say to yourself, "The person most hurt by unforgiveness is me".
    <br>When we fail to forgive, we find ourselves in a torture chamber.
    <br>We find ourselves wallowing in our own sins.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The harbouring of a spirit of unforgiveness breaks the communion with God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Therefore, we should not come to a confrontation about sin with the intent of punishing the sin
    <br>or with the intent of harming the other person.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If we do not come to a settling account in this matter we find ourselves in grave danger.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you ready for a new level in your relationship?
    <br>Are you ready to reshape your relationship in your business, home, marriage, life?
    <br>Are you ready?"
    <br>Say, "Don't give up.
    <br>Stay put; a new year is coming".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We should not enter the New Year with a heart full of offence, full of pain of the past.
    <br>If you enter the New year holding onto offence,
    <br>you are still living in the past and there is nothing new in the incoming year.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, we make the year new by the way we live it".
    <br>You make the year new by the way you live it.
    <br>You renew the covenant by the way you live it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How do we live it?
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, how do you make the year new?"
    <br>Say, "Give them another chance".
    <br>Give them another chance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, I want you to look at your neighbour and to ask him this question.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, do you find it difficult to forgive?"
    <br>Ask him.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, do you find it difficult to forgive?"
    <br>If you find it difficult to forgive, then take a look back at your own life and answer this question.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you ready to ask the question?
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you ready? Let me ask you a question".
    <br>Say, "What has the Heavenly Father forgiven in your life?"
    <br>Think about it and tell your neighbour again.
    <br>What has the Heavenly Father forgiven in your life? Think about it.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, how patient the Heavenly Father is with you - forgiving you day in, day out".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, how merciful the Heavenly Father is with you".
    <br>When you ignore Him, when you disappoint Him, when you break His commandments,
    <br>His love upon you remains constant.
    <br>Do you find it difficult to forgive?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So brothers, this is the answer.
    <br>This is the key to make all things new.
    <br>Loving your enemy, forgiving those who sin against you will always seem unreasonable,
    <br>until you realise that we were enemies to God and He forgave us.
    <br>So loving your enemies, forgiving them will seem unrealistic
    <br>until we come to realise that we were enemies to God and He forgave us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, if you are forgiven..."
    <br>Are you sure, you are forgiven?
    <br>I'm asking you, what is the state of your heart?
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, if you are forgiven, that forgiveness will produce in you a forgiving spirit towards others".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Therefore, let love lead.
    <br>Can we stand up in His presence.
    <br>Say, "Let love lead.
    <br>In your marriage - let love lead.
    <br>In your business - let love lead.
    <br>In your relationship - let love lead".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you follow the light of love in this coming year,
    <br>nothing out of God's control can happen to you.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, when you follow the light of love in this coming year,
    <br>no matter how thick the darkness, nothing out of God's control will happen to you.
    <br>Nothing out of God's control will happen to your marriage, to your life.
    <br>That is the promise of God.
    <br>God bless His Word, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
