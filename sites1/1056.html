    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to do my own without music.
    <br>Without music, without drum -
    <br>to show I am rejoicing with you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Please, you are using your excitement to disturb me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you can see me without drum, without music.
    <br>No, I'm dancing to the viewers. You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I know why you are dancing and I know why you are happy. Yes, because there is food and everything
    <br>on your table there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can somebody show me the table where there is everything you are looking for?
    <br>Where is that table here?
    <br>Where? The table is in your heart.
    <br>Oh, table inside your heart.
    <br>Does the Bible say the table is in your heart?
    <br>It says, He will set a table before you, not your heart.
    <br>Where is that table?
    <br>Because the way you behave, as if you know and you have even seen the table before you.
    <br>You are just waiting for "Go!",
    <br>so that you start taking what is on the table.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You are happy.
    <br>You don't mean it.
    <br>God gives us faith to believe.
    <br>It means that faith comes from God; He gives us faith to believe.
    <br>If faith from God has not come, there is no way you can believe.
    <br>In His faith, you are thanking Him for a more glorious answer to your prayer.
    <br>If I'm talking to you.
    <br>That is the way, the way you behave.
    <br>You are just...
    <br>In His faith, you are thanking Him for a more glorious answer to your prayer,
    <br>than you can imagine.
    <br>That is the way.
    <br>The joy is still there?
    <br>Because you are quiet.
    <br>Let me see you smile now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How can somebody smile when there is nothing?
    <br>What are you smiling about?
    <br>Tell me "The table", unless God gives you faith to believe.
    <br>You can't just say  - I believe.
    <br>You believe without faith?
    <br>You must be given faith to believe.
    <br>Listen to what I said.
    <br>In His faith, we are thanking Him for a more glorious answer to our prayer.
    <br>Tell you neighbour:
    <br>"In His faith, we thank Him for a more glorious answer to our prayer."
    <br>In His faith, I thank Him for a more glorious answer to my prayer,
    <br>than I can imagine
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is all this. Oh, my God.
    <br>You can know, if you have made it.
    <br>What you are standing on - not your feeling but His Word.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>You can know you are saved. People deceive themselves - "I am saved, I am a child of God" - you can know.
    <br>Sometimes, people just allow emotion to blind their reason.
    <br>People say: "People are dancing, let me join them dance".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"If I am not dancing, they will complain, let me join them."
    <br>No, you should not join them.
    <br>You must have reason to dance.
    <br>How many of you join them dance?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Aah, there are many.
    <br>How many people here joined the people dance?
    <br>They are many here who joined them.
    <br>Oh, my God. How many of us there joined them dance?
    <br>There are too many there. Look at the many people that joined them.
    <br>Not that you danced, you joined people dance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallellujah! Say:
    <br>"Lord, don't let emotions blind my reason."
    <br>What you see, what you hear, what the situation looks like.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Feeling, what you see, emotion, feeling, what you see.
    <br>"People are dancing - let me join them."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"People are falling, I will not fall. Let me stand well, he is about to get to me."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Even some people even turn back to me. I keep turning their face, they keep turning back.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Lord, don't let emotions blind my reason.
    <br>What is your reason of coming here? Salvation.
    <br>Jesus is the reason.
    <br>What's your reason?
    <br>Jesus is my reason of coming here.
    <br>But emotion, feeling, what you see... Some people, when they sit,
    <br>they will begin to look at the style of attire people wear, the style of hair line, spectacles, tie.
    <br>During the break, they will go to the garage and look at the kind of beautiful car, flashy car.
    <br>They say: "This car is latest, let me just write the number, ok. Let me take a picture,
    <br>I must get this car next year."
    <br>Is that the reason why you are here?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Lord, don't let emotion blind my reason.
    <br>Jesus is my reason of coming here.
    <br>Jesus is our reason.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Maybe while you are sitting down, your stomach just turns, you feel some sharp pain.
    <br>Your neighbour will say: "What's wrong, what can I do for you?"
    <br>"You know what is wrong with me?" Because of that everything about you changes.
    <br>"Why should this thing happen to me in the church?"
    <br>"These people have traced me here."
    <br>Who are the people that used to trace you?
    <br>The door is locked, they traced you?
    <br>"They have traced me. They come here again, this how the thing used to do me.They have traced me."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Lord, don't let emotions blind my reason.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So rise up, let's offer a prayer to our heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Come, Lord Jesus and abide in our heart.
    <br>Teach us Lord, the Psalm of faith and restore our calm, in Jesus Christ's name
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>Restore our calm despite our doubt and fear.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Think about that, it's a word to think about.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sometimes you just say: "Jesus Christ!" All what you are saying does not have meaning.
    <br>You yourself should reason, think of what you are saying.
    <br>Come, Lord Jesus and abide in our heart.
    <br>Teach us the Psalm of faith, restore our calm despite our fear and doubt,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Remain silent.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At this hour, reason with yourself what you need to continue at this moment.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need the gift of eyes that see, of ears that hear what Jesus is telling us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Not just looking at me.
    <br>I put on shirt with white, with red, with this. "Look at the way he behaves, he goes this way and that way,
    <br>he is young man, I don't know, I thought he is an old man each time I see him on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>he looks old but look at... Oh, my God it's my first time."
    <br>These are emotions, what you can see, what you hear.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All you need now - the gift of eyes that see, of ears that hear what Jesus is telling us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Repeat after me:
    <br>"The gift of eyes that see, of ears that hear what God is telling us".
    <br>Again.
    <br>The gift of eyes that see, of ears that hear what God is telling us.
    <br>Again.
    <br>The gift of eyes that see, of ears that hear what God is telling us.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you have this, you can begin to thank Him for a more glorious answer to your prayer,
    <br>than you can imagine.
    <br>Because it is not possible for you to begin to thank Him  for what you have not received,
    <br>thank Him for answering your prayer when you have not offered the prayer
    <br>and you are thanking. "Thank you for answering my prayer", whereas you have not even offered the prayer.
    <br>You have not even seen and you are thanking Him for what?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Unless you are able to know and see the one that is talking to you here,
    <br>then you can obey what I'm saying.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A man talking to you is different from God talking to you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When God talks to you, you hear, you listen.
    <br>But when a man is talking to you...
    <br>"What is he saying?"
    <br>This is what you need now.
    <br>The gift of eyes that see, of ears that hear what God is telling us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus must be honoured 
    <br>Must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured 
    <br>In my life everyday
    <br>Think about that. He is not a man. He is a Spirit.
    <br>God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in what?
    <br>Not these eyes, not these ears.
    <br>To honour Him - not these eyes , not these ears.
    <br>You need the gift of eyes that see, of ears that hear what He is saying.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus must be honoured 
    <br>Must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br> In my life everyday
    <br>How can Jesus be honoured,
    <br>when you are looking at Him by sight, hear Him by your ear?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How can He be honoured?
    <br>You are waiting to see Him with your sight. Only faith pleases Him.
    <br>Only faith sees Him; only faith hears Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm talking to your spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In your spirit, begin to thank Him for a more glorious answer to your prayer.
    <br>In His faith, thank Him.
    <br>In His faith, ask.
    <br>In His faith, begin to thank Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>Holy Spirit I look up to You help me 
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>Holy Spirit I look up to You help me 
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are not here to talk to the air. God has prepared you in advance.
    <br>God prepared you in advance before He put you in the journey to come here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can not just wake up in the morning and say: "I'm coming to the church".
    <br>The church of the Holy Ghost, the church which foundation is the Holy Spirit - and you wake up,
    <br>you start that thought in your heart, begin to think of it: "I must go to this church" -
    <br>the moment you begin that thought, the fight between darkness and light started.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It's not the day you start the thought of coming here that you came.
    <br>Some of you started a year ago, two years and you been wrestling with for, against.
    <br>Immediately you have the thought: "I must come to this church", trouble started.
    <br>Fight between the Holy Spirit and evil spirit.
    <br>"You will not go!" - in your night, in your dream, nightmare, fight.
    <br>Just to stop you. Even the business you plan to go and do fail and a lot of things started just to stop you.
    <br>But at last...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How can you be here now and begin to doubt?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After you have fought the battle.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And you are here at last and you begin: "What is going to happen?"
    <br>What is going to happen? Wait till you see.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After you have fought the battle, a lot of battles -
    <br>at last! Many have been fighting this battle for the past 2-4 years before finally came here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The table has been set before you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you are here at last, your prayer should be,
    <br>"Thank You, Lord for a more glorious answer to my prayer."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now you open your lips and say:
    <br>"In Your Faith, I thank You for a more glorious answer to my prayer".
    <br>Now you open your lips.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"In Your Presence".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Your presence I am content
    <br>In Your presence there is light 
    <br>Expressions of Your love
    <br>Revelations of Your power and might
    <br>In Your presence I can bring a love song offering 
    <br>I'm in the presence of my King
    <br>In Your presence I am content
    <br>In Your presence there is light 
    <br>Expressions of Your love
    <br>Revelations of your power and might
    <br>In Your presence I can bring a love song offering 
    <br>I'm in the presence of my King
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers all over the world - amen!
    <br>Thank you, Lord. You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So right in your heart
    <br>in His faith, begin to give thanks to God for a more glorious answer to your prayer,
    <br>more than you can imagine.
    <br>Don't begin to say: "Heal me, heal me!" Just begin to give thanks to Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>For you to be here the job is half done.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>"The job is half done".
    <br>For you just enter here and sit down, you have scored 50%.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I know, what human wants is unlimited.
    <br>I know what you want but I just assure you - 50%.
    <br>So just 50% for you because God prepared you in advance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>For you to sit down, and those viewers are anywhere they are, watching this telecast
    <br>under the influence of our voice - 50%.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The job is half done. So if the job is half done, the other 50% - who will do it?
    <br>God!
    <br>Right now in His faith, say:
    <br>"In His faith, I thank Him for a more glorious answer to my prayer, more than I can imagine."
    <br>Thank you, Lord, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Receive a gift of eyes to see, of ears to hear, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes, there is need for awakening to know all these - how do we approach it.
    <br>This is an apostolic ministry, you can not touch anything without the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Holy Ghost for a moment of your turning, of your look, for you cough, for your greeting.
    <br>You need Holy Spirit to lead you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So your attention.
    <br>Don't allow emotions to blind your reason.
    <br>God has made friend, a relationship is about God.
    <br>If you are here to make friend, please there are many reasons people are here
    <br>but the reason we are here - for the salvation of our soul.
    <br>So please emotion, feeling - out of it.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Pay attention.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
