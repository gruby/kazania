    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus is the reason we are here today.
    <br>He is the reason you are here today and He knows you by name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Give a joyful smile to your neighbour, a joyful smile.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>worry not because I know my Redeemer, my Saviour is alive.
    <br>I am in His presence".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>your load, your trouble -  give it to Him and receive His peace".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>My name is Racine
    <br>I have the inner grace to be a disciple of my mentor Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>who has changed my life today.
    <br>I am here to share with you the message of salvation and righteousness.
    <br>That message will point you to your future in Jesus' name.
    <br>That message will point me to my future - the good future God has for me.
    <br>Thank You, Lord! In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The Scripture says that we are in the world but we are not part of it.
    <br>We are in the world but we are not a part of it.
    <br>Brethren.
    <br>The Bible says that fleshly desires and spiritual desires are two opposite masters.
    <br>Let someone say, "Two opposite masters".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You cannot give equal attention, equal concentration, equal loyalty to both
    <br>because both of them want us to run the race with them.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, who are you serving today?"
    <br>Brethren.
    <br>The Bible says that if we live according to the desire of the human sinful nature, we will die
    <br>but if we live according to the Spirit, we have life and peace.
    <br>Let someone say, "Life and peace".
    <br>Today people run, run, run because of outward needs.
    <br>It is the fear of tomorrow that leads people to amass, to lay up wealth on earth -
    <br>wealth on earth with neglect of eternity.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Neighbour, if you are focused only on making money, a large slice of life will pass you by".
    <br>Satisfaction in life does not consist alone in having wealth, fleet of cars - no!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The man of God points to us that
    <br>until you experience God, there will be dissatisfaction in your life;
    <br>there will be a sense of hunger to know what happens after life is over.
    <br>Remember his words - vanity, vanity upon vanity.
    <br>What profit is man to gain the whole world and lose his soul.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, pay attention to God's Word".
    <br>Pay attention, be focused on God
    <br>because where your treasure is, there your heart will be.
    <br>This brings us to the title of our message this morning:
    <br>LIVE FOR ETERNITY
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, live for eternity.
    <br>Neighbour, focus on Jesus; He is the answer".
    <br>Let's go to the Book of Ecclesiastes 3.
    <br>We start reading from verse 11.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>The Book of Ecclesiastes 3:11 - I read:
    <br>"He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also He has put eternity in their hearts."
    <br>Let someone say, "Eternity".
    <br>"Also He has put eternity in their hearts,
    <br>except that no one can find out the work that God does from beginning to end."
    <br>Verse 12.
    <br>"I know that nothing is better for them than to rejoice, and to do good in their lives."
    <br>Let someone say, "Live for eternity".
    <br>Right from the beginning in the Garden of Eden,
    <br>the cordial, the good relationship between God and man
    <br>suffered a great loss when man broke the ties, when man broke the bond
    <br>by suddenly  becoming unfaithful to God.
    <br>Immediately, Adam missed the mark - the standard of God, obedience to His Word,
    <br>he was filled with guilt and was not able to come into the presence of God anymore.
    <br>This means, the mountain of guilt is what separates man from his Creator.
    <br>Man's rights and privileges were taken away from him; dominion was removed from him.
    <br>But praise the Lord God Almighty.
    <br>Let someone say, "God is merciful".
    <br>Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, our Saviour, was sent from above to buy us back
    <br>from the dominion of sin and satan.
    <br>Jesus came to set us free and the Scripture says, "Whom the Son of God sets free is free indeed".
    <br>I don't know what you have been through but all I can tell you today:
    <br>If you make Jesus Christ your Lord and Saviour, all your sins will be forgiven.
    <br>But you do not experience that forgiveness until you receive it by faith.
    <br>Let someone say, "By faith".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will not experience it until you receive it by faith.
    <br>Faith focuses on God.
    <br>Let someone say, "Believing in Christ - that is the connection".
    <br>Believing in Christ - that is our connection because the Scripture says,
    <br>believing is the only answer
    <br>because righteousness is not for those who confess only but for those who believe.
    <br>Let someone say, "For those who believe".
    <br>Believing in Christ Jesus redeems our life, redeems our times, redeems our ways
    <br>because Jesus is the only Way, the only Truth and the only Life.
    <br>As the Way, He is the beginning, the middle and the end.
    <br>As the Truth, He is the Source.
    <br>To know the truth is to know Jesus Christ.
    <br>As the Life, He is the end of it.
    <br>There is no reality outside Him and that life is eternal life.
    <br>Let someone say, "Eternal life".
    <br>Eternal life - the nature of God.
    <br>Let someone say, "Eternal life".
    <br>Believing in Christ redeems my life.
    <br>Believing in Christ redeems my way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus said in John 10:27:
    <br>"I know My sheep. My sheep know My voice and follow Me and I will give them  eternal life."
    <br>Eternal life is the joy and chief good of the immortal soul.
    <br>God is not as much interested in our present condition than in our eternal glory
    <br>because man is an immortal soul.
    <br>Therefore, the happiness God provides is eternal life as a gift
    <br>and with it, we have the assurance of Heaven.
    <br>Say, "I have the assurance of Heaven".
    <br>God's love for you and me is unlimited and His love expands beyond the grave.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren.
    <br>Shepherds oftentimes lose their sheep to perish
    <br>but our Shepherd, Jesus has vowed that none of His sheep shall perish.
    <br>Say, "I'm in God's hands; no one can snatch me out of the hand of my Shepherd".
    <br>He so carefully takes care of us, not only within His flock, His fold
    <br>but also under His protection and preservation.
    <br>That is why you are alive today.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, trust in Jesus Christ
    <br>and you shall be never confounded in time or eternity".
    <br>Say, "My ways are secured. I am walking with the Lord".
    <br>What is seen cannot dictate my direction.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus Christ is greater than all the combined forces of hell and earth.
    <br>His purpose is to take us to the Heavenly Father - you and I.
    <br>Therefore, all the divine powers of Heaven are engaged to accomplish this divine purpose.
    <br>God allowed everything that concerns you and I on earth to happen in its proper time and season.
    <br>No matter what you have been living from child birth, there is an appointed time for you
    <br>and I believe today is the time for you.
    <br>I believe no matter what you have been going through, you are under His care.
    <br>No matter what comes, no matter what happens, Jesus is aware.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Fear not. Neighbour, worry not".
    <br>Human beings long for eternity
    <br>yet they do not understand what God has done from the beginning to end.
    <br>You may not understand His ways
    <br>but the Scripture says that is what constitutes the beauty of creation.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, God has a plan for me. That plan is for whosoever wills".
    <br>Human understanding is limited because it cannot see God.
    <br>That point of view is not based on the truth; Jesus Christ is the Truth.
    <br>Our human understanding is limited.
    <br>We cannot see the things that are invisible, which are eternal.
    <br>Many of us today are spiritually blinded; we are dull in comprehension.
    <br>The unseen realm, the unseen Kingdom of God in our midst
    <br>is absolutely blocked, closed to our spiritual vision.
    <br>Don't measure the love of God by your situation.
    <br>Don't measure God's faithfulness, His promises by your situation.
    <br>Stop limiting God for a certain answer.
    <br>Stop limiting God to outward needs, there is more to that.
    <br>God has a plan for you and me.
    <br>We always see the outward effect of the devil but we are blind to the spiritual cause.
    <br>I mean, whatever you are going through, we don't know the purpose.
    <br>We don't know the cause, the source of our situation.
    <br>We are quickly minded to judge, to blame and pity ourselves.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't let your situation mislead you".
    <br>We should be careful not to misjudge ourselves because of our situation.
    <br>When you find yourself in circumstances such as hardship, affliction, trials of any kind, failure,
    <br>remember that what you see as failure is not failure at all from eternity's perspective.
    <br>What you see as the end is not the end from eternity's perspective.
    <br>Say, "Beyond my situation, there lies God's purpose".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, beyond that trouble, behind it lies the purpose of God".
    <br>God sometimes uses foolish things -
    <br>He can use anything to strengthen our desire and determination for Him,
    <br>to stop us awhile when we go too far.
    <br>He uses anything to strengthen our determination for Him, our desire for Him,
    <br>to stop us for a while in order to reorganise our lives for our future.
    <br>So as a believer, no matter what you are passing through, that serves a purpose.
    <br>Are you sick? Are you facing bareness? Are you rejected?
    <br>Are you living in failure, in fear, condemnation, guilt?
    <br>Remember, there is a way out and the way out for you has come.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, there is a way out and the way out for me has come".
    <br>Jesus Christ is the Way; He is the beginning, the middle and the end.
    <br>He is aware of my situation.
    <br>As a believer, that situation is meant to prepare you for a new level in life.
    <br>As a believer, what you are going through is for your obedience to God's will
    <br>because God values processing more than results.
    <br>Say, "God values processing more than results".
    <br>The Scripture says that physical growth is a function of time,
    <br>intellectual growth is a function of learning
    <br>but spiritual growth is a function of none of these;
    <br>it is a function of obedience to the will of God.
    <br>Neighbour, apply your heart to understanding.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, seek Him, seek His Kingdom, seek His wisdom, that's the wisdom of God".
    <br>It sees beyond now.
    <br>Finally brethren, this world is a market.
    <br>In order not to end up like the masses out there who are merely wandering,
    <br>uncertain of their goals and dreams, your objective must be clear today.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that and I quote:
    <br>In order to live life to the fullest, your goal must reflect your purpose.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is our purpose?
    <br>Jesus says clearly, '"Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness
    <br>and every other thing shall be given to you".
    <br>Eternal life is the sole end of our activities on this earth and it is for whosoever wills.
    <br>Any man who hears the Word of God and acts on it,
    <br>anyone who hears the Word of God and acts on that Word can venture into faith,
    <br>can have faith and exercise faith.
    <br>In other words, salvation is a good thing to hope for but if you want to be saved,
    <br>you must put substance to your faith and receive Jesus by faith.
    <br>Let someone say, "By faith".
    <br>Genuine faith, true faith, as recorded in the Book of Hebrews 11:1 has substance.
    <br>Let someone say, "Substance".
    <br>What is the substance?
    <br>Substance means faith in the eternal and unchanging Word of God.
    <br>Any person today who steps out in this type of faith stands on the solid Rock.
    <br>Say, "I stand on the solid rock".
    <br>You are designed by God to think with Him, act with Him, talk with Him and rule with Him.
    <br>For man to act with God, to plan with God, faith is a necessary condition.
    <br>As you are sitting down, if you trust in Christ's ability to heal you, deliver you, save you, today it is done.
    <br>If you are willing, the job is half done because the Lord is willing.
    <br>Say, if you are willing, the job is half done
    <br>because Jesus is willing to heal, to save and to deliver.
    <br>This message is challenging you today
    <br>to seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness.
    <br>Today, take a pause and reflect on your life because if you learn what God has made you for,
    <br>and how He treasures your company,
    <br>John 7 says, you will discover the streams of living waters welling up to eternal life.
    <br>Have a look of faith to Jesus.
    <br>Neighbour, see  beyond that situation.
    <br>Let us live for eternity and we shall secure all that is available in it.
    <br>Trust in Christ Jesus; you will never be confounded in time or eternity.
    <br>May God bless His Word in Jesus' name.
