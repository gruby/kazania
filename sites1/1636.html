    <br>HOW TO STAY IN THE WILL OF GOD!!! | Racine Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Say, "Lord Jesus, I thank You for every moment of Your attention."
    <br>Here I am, Lord, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You may be seated in His presence.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>The Bible says, all things work for good for those who love God.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Jesus is the reason why we are here today.
    <br>We know His will for us is to be saved, to be delivered, to be blessed
    <br>and to enjoy a life that is full and free.
    <br>That life is set before you today.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the good life is set before you, in the name of Jesus Christ."
    <br>The Bible says that, for a sick person to know that it is the will of God to heal him,
    <br>it is a seed that must be planted in his heart and in his mind.
    <br>For a sinner to know it is God's will to save him,
    <br>it is a seed that must be planted in his heart and mind.
    <br>Jesus cannot save a sinner unless he knows the will of God on the matter.
    <br>Salvation is by faith.
    <br>I mean, by trusting the known will of God in the matter.
    <br>A man can be sick in body and be a friend of God.
    <br>A man can be poor and be a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>When He created man, what mattered to God Almighty
    <br>was not man's physical or mental disposition but one who would be a stakeholder in God's master plan.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you a stakeholder?"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, yes, I am."
    <br>I am a stakeholder in His master plan.
    <br>We are created for the glory of God
    <br>but for man to glorify God - his Creator - his will must be subject to God's will.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, for you to glorify God, your will must be subject to God's will."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let the will of God be done."
    <br>Say, "Lord not my will; let Your will be done."
    <br>This is our message this morning:
    <br>STAY IN THE WILL OF GOD
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "Stay in the will of God."
    <br>Encourage your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>whatever you are passing through, stay in the will of God.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Romans 12.
    <br>I start from verse 1.
    <br>"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies
    <br>a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.
    <br>And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
    <br>that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."
    <br>Let someone say, "Let the will of God be done."
    <br>When we realise who we are before God,
    <br>we will see the need to always consider the will of God, in whatever we do,
    <br>whatever we say and whatever plan we make.
    <br>That is why we find it necessary to consult God
    <br>to ensure that we are acting and praying according to His will.
    <br>His will is to deliver us.
    <br>His will is to bless us.
    <br>His will is to give you breakthrough today.
    <br>His will is to change your life. 
    <br>That's why you are here.
    <br>Say, "That's why I'm here."
    <br>In Matthew 7:7-12, it portrays Jesus' invitation to pray
    <br>and it is always His will to answer your prayers.
    <br>One thing we should know:
    <br>God answers the prayers of faith
    <br>but He does not always answer it to the letter.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>though God Almighty answers the prayer of faith,
    <br>He does not always answer it to the letter."
    <br>That's why today,
    <br>when unanswered prayers stand between people and their faith,
    <br>some blame God for unfaithfulness.
    <br>They fail to realise that
    <br>when we pray not according to the Word of God, our prayer will stand upon our lips.
    <br>When we pray to God, the answer we receive from Him is determined
    <br>but how God chooses to implement His will in the matter.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, let the will of God be done."
    <br>The will of God is part of His divine nature.
    <br>This means we can pray for it.
    <br>"Neighbour, have you said your prayer today?" - ask your neighbour.
    <br>Have you forgiven your enemies today?
    <br>Prayer is a relationship that exists between God and His children.
    <br>God delights in hearing the prayers of His righteous children.
    <br>What makes us righteous?
    <br>In our prayers we learn to put on Jesus Christ as our righteousness
    <br>to have free access to the Father.
    <br>Our spiritual union with Jesus establishes a deep sense of intimacy with God, our Father.
    <br>That's why the man of God says that prayer is a thing of the Spirit.
    <br>Prayer is to the spiritual man what breathing is to the natural man.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>a break in prayer is a break in faith, and a break in faith is a break with God."
    <br>A prayerless home is a Godless home.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, be encouraged; don't let your situation cause you to doubt the will of God."
    <br>Pray the more. Fast the more. Stay put. Don't give up!
    <br>Whatever you are facing today - it may be lack, you may be in dire need -
    <br>but the Scripture says that for a man or woman of faith,
    <br>nothing is lacking while everything is necessary.
    <br>We are faced by God's uncompromising demand for faith.
    <br>God desires faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>But today, due to the pressure and tensions of the world, many have abandoned their homes.
    <br>Many have abandoned their marriages.
    <br>Many have abandoned their businesses.
    <br>Many have even given up their faith,
    <br>because they think there is no way, no hope, no future.
    <br>But let me tell you, there is a way and the way is Jesus!
    <br>Say "Neighbour, there is a way for me. The way is Jesus!
    <br>Neighbour, stay in the will of God."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Stay in the will of God."
    <br>Let me encourage you with the life of Paul; we all know Paul.
    <br>In the Book of 2 Corinthians 12:7-10,
    <br>Paul prayed to the Lord that He may remove the thorn, the pain in his flesh.
    <br>He appealed to the Lord three times and Jesus said, "My grace is sufficient for you."
    <br>He has learned the secret to be content in whatever situation he faced.
    <br>When he knew the will of God on the matter, Paul said, "When I am weak, I am strong.
    <br>Your grace is sufficient for me."
    <br>Say, "Lord, Your grace is sufficient for me. Let Your will be done".
    <br>The word grace means God's will for you and I.
    <br>It is sufficient to enlighten us.
    <br>It is sufficient to encourage us and to comfort us.
    <br>It is sufficient to cheer up our spirit in all distress and affliction of this world.
    <br>Let someone say, "His grace is sufficient for you."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, let the will of God be done."
    <br>Fear not. Stay put. Stay in the will of God.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit that strengthened and sustained Jesus at the Garden of Gethsemane
    <br>and Jesus said, "Father, let Your will be done."
    <br>The lesson we learn from Paul: Men and women of faith never give up.
    <br>They never abandon their cause, even when the way is so rough.
    <br>They stay in the will of God no matter what comes, no matter what happens.
    <br>Each day they stay true to their purpose in life through rain and storm.
    <br>Whatever the vicissitudes of life, they stay put.
    <br>They stay in their marriage, business, waiting for what God has to say; they never give up.
    <br>They overcome obstacles daily by keeping their purpose in the forefront of their hearts
    <br>because they know that whatever happens to them today,
    <br>true fulfilment comes from doing the will of God.
    <br>Whatever happens to you, stay put!
    <br>To stay put is to stay in the will of God.
    <br>Say "Neighbour, stay in the will of God. His grace is sufficient for you."
    <br>Today many have changed the course of the history of their lives
    <br>through inability to see beyond the situation at hand.
    <br>But let me tell you something today and I want you to repeat it with me.
    <br>Say, "No mortal man, no devil can supersede the plan of God, the will of God for my life."
    <br>No mortal man, no devil can supersede the plan of God for my life.
    <br>When you lay hold of this truth, it will set you free.
    <br>There is only one person that can get you out of the will of God - it is you.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, there is only one person that can get you out of the will of God -  it is you."
    <br>We abort the promises of God by our disobedience.
    <br>When God created man, He gave him the special right of discretion -
    <br>I mean the ability to exercise the will through his mind.
    <br>God has given man the power to choose the cause of the action of his life.
    <br>Man has the ability to choose, to pray, to teach, and to act
    <br>but the Holy Spirit prays, chooses, and does all things according to the perfect will of God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, stay in the will of God."
    <br>How do we know the will of God?
    <br>The man of God says we know God by the Word He speaks
    <br>and the Word God speaks represents His heart's desire for me.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, I know God by the Word He speaks
    <br>and the Word God speaks represents His heart's desire, His will for me."
    <br>God speaks to us today through His Word by His Spirit - not to our ears but to our hearts.
    <br>We need to allow the Word of God in the midst of our hearts, for there is the will of God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, stay in the will of God."
    <br>How do we get the Word in the midst of our hearts?
    <br>Everyone sees through different eyes.
    <br>Everyone hears through different ears.
    <br>Everyone feels through different hearts.
    <br>Different hearts means we have different ways of attending to the Word of God.
    <br>Some hearts receive the Word of God and others resist the Word of God.
    <br>The man of God tells us that the only way to get the Word of God in our heart is to read our Bible slowly,
    <br>attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>Show me your Bible.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, my victory, all I'm asking for, the will of God is in this book, the Holy Bible."
    <br>Say, "I need to get this into my heart."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We need to read the Bible slowly.
    <br>This means to give attention to God Almighty.
    <br>To give attention to God by reading slowly is to stay focused.
    <br>We focus on God who is unseen by focusing on His Word.
    <br>Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>We say everyone receives the Word in a different way.
    <br>We need to read the Bible attentively.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, read your Bible attentively."
    <br>We believers, as the man of God says, we don't have time out; we have time in.
    <br>We need to be 'off' on the outside in this world of distraction and to be 'on' on the inside.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>be 'off' on the outside and be 'on' on the inside."
    <br>The Book of Luke 17:20-21 says time on the inside is time with the Kingdom of God.
    <br>Time with God is time for renewal, for refreshment, for breakthrough, for healing.
    <br>Today, you will receive your healing, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Today, I receive my breakthrough, in the name of Jesus."
    <br>Read your Bible repeatedly.
    <br>The prophet says we need to insert our name where the passage of the Bible is personal.
    <br>That is, we are here to apply the Bible rightfully in our lives,
    <br>because the Bible is the Book that reads you even as you are reading it.
    <br>It is the Word of His grace that establishes the Kingdom of God in our heart.
    <br>Say, "Father, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done. Let the will of God be done."
    <br>You are here today, the will of God for you today is to be delivered.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The will of God for you today is to be saved, to prosper in all your ways,
    <br>and the table has been set before you today.
    <br>No matter the negative experiences you have been through,
    <br>this is the day that the Lord has made.
    <br>Let someone say, "I will rejoice and be glad in it."
    <br>Finally brethren,
    <br>when you know the will of God, that will impart a strength to endure
    <br>whatever situation you are facing.
    <br>When you know it is the will of God to rescue your marriage, you will not divorce,
    <br>you will stay in the will of God.
    <br>Today your marriage will be rescued, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When you know it is the will of God to rescue your business, your career, your health,
    <br>you will stay put; you will stay in the will of God.
    <br>Today, you will be rescued, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Your business, your health will be rescued, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Whatever happens in your life, when you know God is about to rescue you,
    <br>you will not despair.
    <br>You will not listen to the temptation of that situation and begin to act out of character
    <br>and begin to react badly to the emotional weight of your situation.
    <br>Stay in the will of God.
    <br>Say neighbour, "Stay in the will of God."
    <br>Speak to the viewers, "Whatever you are facing, stay in the will of God!"
    <br>Everyday we stay true to our purpose in life by focusing on what Jesus says.
    <br>Staying true to your purpose in life is to stay true to Jesus.
    <br>Jesus is faithful; He will never abandon us.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, stay true to your purpose in life; stay true to Jesus."
    <br>When you stay true to Jesus, you stay with the Holy Spirit - that is where our security lies.
    <br>Today is the day that the Lord has made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.
    <br>Any moment from now, you will see His mercy, His compassion and that God is never late.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
