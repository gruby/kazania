  <p>    
    <br>This is prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua stretches forth his right hand in prayer,
    <br>the light of God exposes and expels every shade of darkness in the lives of the people
    <br>and they fall under the influence of the anointing.
    <br>Let us watch how one young man is loosed from the hand of the enemy
    <br>through the lightning touch of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I have frustrated him enough.
    <br>How?
    <br>I've made him do things that he's not supposed to do.
    <br>Like what?
    <br>They are too many to mention.
    <br>Allow me to go; I won't come back to him again.
    <br>Because he is a destined child.
    <br>I possessed him right from birth.
    <br>He is not married; I made him not to.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!
    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>My name is Franklin from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I'm here to thank God for delivering me from the spirit of man,
    <br>which has tormented me for years.
    <br>So this started when I was 19 years old.
    <br>There was a particular man who used to visit me in my dreams.
    <br>I'd have sex with the man in the dream.
    <br>During the day time, I would start to have this urge.
    <br>I'd start looking for men to sleep with.
    <br>It has made me not have affection for women.
    <br>Even if there's a woman naked in front of me, nothing would move me,
    <br>except for my fellow men.
    <br>I normally get them mainly on Facebook.
    <br>They post nude pictures - and all sleeveless clothes.
    <br>That is how I identified them.
    <br>But this has tormented me.
    <br>It has put me to shame in so many ways.
    <br>During my service year, this particular issue nearly ruined my service year,
    <br>but l thank God who saved me.
    <br>Because there was a young guy that I had an encounter with -
    <br>that had reported me to the school authority.
    <br>I was expelled from school.
    <br>So this has brought much shame to me.
    <br>When you approach men to have affairs with them, is it that they give you money
    <br>or you give them money
    <br>or you just do it to satisfy that urge?
    <br>No, whenever I have an encounter with that man from my dreams,
    <br>I would receive money in my account in that particular day.
    <br>So I'd have money and I'd begin to invite them.
    <br>I would be the one who spends money.
    <br>I'd give them money - they did not give me - until that money is finished.
    <br>Since I started having this experience,
    <br>I've had a lot of frustration.
    <br>Whatever thing that I do on my own leads to setback.
    <br>Even with the issue of my visa, I've applied to different countries.
    <br>They have all denied me a Visa more than three times.
    <br>So I'm being frustrated in all areas since my service.
    <br>And this particular issue has even made me develop high blood pressure
    <br>but I don't think about it.
    <br>At my age now, 27, I'm having high blood pressure.
    <br>So this has brought much shame to me.
    <br>I was asking, when will I be delivered?
    <br>I've gone to many churches.
    <br>I've gone to many places apart from native ones.
    <br>There's a day I called one particular pastor on the phone.
    <br>I explained my case and he prayed for me.
    <br>The pastor is well-known.
    <br>But still, after praying for me,
    <br>the next day it felt as if the spirits came back with full force.
    <br>Last Sunday, I was opportuned because I do watch Emanuel TV.
    <br>I've seen many people being delivered.
    <br>I said, 'Let me just come to the Synagogue, Church of All Nations -
    <br>I've been hearing about.'
    <br>I was still believing that God will remember my case and set me free.
    <br>I was here last week Sunday during the mass prayer.
    <br>That was when I received my deliverance.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Since that Sunday, I'm totally delivered.
    <br>I really experienced raw power.
    <br>There is power here!
    <br>Since then, I'm totally free - I don't have that urge anymore.
    <br>I am reasoning like a human being.
    <br>I'm thinking like a man.
    <br>I'm sounding like a man.
    <br>I can remember vividly, in 2nd Kings chapter 5,
    <br>when Naaman had a problem with the Syrian army,
    <br>the little girl instructed him to go to Israel.
    <br>There is a great prophet there.
    <br>It doesn't show or maybe prove that there is no prophet in Syria,
    <br>but there are some special cases that need special treatment.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Viewers all over the world and the people here,
    <br>distance shouldn't be a barrier to you.
    <br>If you're facing the same evil spirit that I was facing then,
    <br>if you are around this country, find your way here.
    <br>Even if you are not around Nigeria.
    <br>Don't mind when people say all sorts of things
    <br>because demons can never cast out demons.
    <br>That is one thing that I believe.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Now that you are set free,
    <br>we want to encourage you to remain in faith in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Those who are delivered by Christ's Word must be ruled by His Word.
    <br>You need the Word of God.
    <br>You need to embrace the wonderful Word of God
    <br>as the most effective instrument for change
    <br>and the only means by which you can maintain this deliverance you have received.
    <br>And we pray that God Almighty will give you the grace
    <br>to make the Word of God the standard for your life, in Jesus' name.
