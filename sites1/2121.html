    <br>Ukraine

    <br>We thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team for this opportunity.
    <br>Natalia
    <br>Ukraine
    <br>My name is Natalia.
    <br>I am from Ukraine.
    <br>For me, the New Anointing Water is a touch from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>A SPECIAL MESSAGE
    <br>FROM T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>I want to talk to you about the New Anointing Water and the New Anointing Sticker.
    <br>Give me your time.
    <br>Viewers, the manner in which we receive the New Anointing Water
    <br>and the New Anointing Sticker matters.
    <br>I give it to you freely for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Give it to others freely as you have received - for the salvation of their soul.
    <br>This will now take me to the Book of Mark 2:1-5, Luke 16:15,
    <br>Jeremiah 17:9-10 and James 4:3.
    <br>We shall take our reading from the Book of Mark 2. I will start my reading from verse 1.
    <br>"... later Jesus returned to Capernaum,
    <br>and the news of His arrival spread quickly through the town.
    <br>Soon the house where He was staying was so packed with visitors
    <br>that there was no room for one more person, not even outside the door.
    <br>... He preached the Word to them."
    <br>"Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man,
    <br>'My son, your sins are forgiven.'"
    <br>He knows our disposition. He knows our nature. He knows our heart.
    <br>Jesus looks at the motive of our actions, but men look at the action.
    <br>I mean, Jesus looks at why we do what we do, but men look at what we do.
    <br>Once any selfish intention or motive is involved
    <br>- that is, if money changes hands in whatever way -
    <br>the anointing in the water will go away, leaving only ordinary water in the bottle.
    <br>Viewers, I repeat again: Once any selfish intention or motive is involved
    <br>- that is, if money changes hands in whatever way -
    <br>the anointing in the water will go away,
    <br>leaving only ordinary water in the bottle.
    <br>In the Book of Matthew 7:1-5 - our motives are weighed by the Lord.
    <br>That is why we must not be in haste to judge someone's actions.
    <br>Jesus tests our heart to reward us.
    <br>I repeat again: Jesus tests our heart to reward us.
    <br>Viewers, don't be deceived.
    <br>To get it to you costs nothing - no shipping or posting costs.
    <br>The Anointing Water is God's gift to us.
    <br>What it costs to get to you is our own contribution.
    <br>I repeat again: What it costs to get to you is our own contribution.
    <br>The level of our sacrifice will determine the level of anointing we enjoy.
