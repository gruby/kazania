    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Happy New Year!"
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Happy New Year!"
    <br>Say, "Happy New Year!"
    <br>Yes, you may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>What a wonderful privilege to be here in the presence of God the very first Sunday
    <br>of the new year, 2019!
    <br>My name is Brother Chris.
    <br>I first and foremost want to give thanks to Jesus Christ
    <br>for the life of His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I am just one of the millions of beneficiaries of God's grace in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and it's a humbling experience to stand here in your midst to be able to share with you
    <br>the life-changing Word of God
    <br>and I pray that this Word will find a place in your heart, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Now, it is 2019. Congratulations, tell your neighbour, "Congratulations!"
    <br>We know that it is by God's grace that we have entered the New Year.
    <br>The New Year period is a very important period, not just to celebrate, thank God and to rejoice.
    <br>It is also an opportunity for reflection on the outgoing year and preparation for the year ahead
    <br>because examining our lives is a good thing.
    <br>Tell you neighbour, say, "Neighbour, examining our lives is a good thing".
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that few things are more dangerous than a person with an unexamined life.
    <br>So, this is an opportunity to examine ourselves in the light of God's Word.
    <br>The result of our self-examination will determine the kind of person we are.
    <br>Once again, brethren, this first Sunday of the New Year, we want to use this as an opportunity to reflect,
    <br>to examine ourselves in the light of God's Word.
    <br>If you sincerely examine yourself, tell your neighbour, "Sincerely".
    <br>The word 'sincerely' is very important because men look at our actions
    <br>but Jesus looks at the motive behind our actions.
    <br>It is not just about examination for the sake of tradition, for the sake of that it is the New Year.
    <br>It must be sincere.
    <br>If we sincerely examine ourselves, I believe that the result of our reflection
    <br>will lead us to the conclusion that enough is enough.
    <br>What do I mean by this?
    <br>What I mean is very simple.
    <br>This year 2019, if you want to be a Christian, be a Christian.
    <br>Enough is enough to church attendance without real repentance.
    <br>Enough is enough to the word of prayer in our mouth without the Word of God in our hearts.
    <br>Enough is enough to lip service without life service.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Enough is enough!"
    <br>Enough is enough to the religion of words without corresponding action flowing from relationship.
    <br>Enough is enough for us to come to church on Sunday to be moved, to be motivated, inspired
    <br>by the service and the sermon, then fall back into our bad habits on Monday,
    <br>succumb to our senses on Tuesday,
    <br>wallow in our weaknesses on Wednesday -
    <br>enough is enough!
    <br>We can't continue like this!
    <br>Enough is enough for us appeasing man at the same time claiming
    <br>that we are trying to please God.
    <br>For how long will we continue to warm the seats in our churches?
    <br>For how long - coming to church just to sit to be seen, to talk to be heard,
    <br>to walk to be noticed, to give to be praised
    <br>when Jesus, the Head of the Church looks at the motive behind your actions?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Enough is enough!"
    <br>Do you know the reason why I am talking about this today?
    <br>Because time is running, the clock is ticking, destiny is waiting.
    <br>You see what's happening in this fast paced world; who can imagine that we are in 2019.
    <br>Everything seems to be going so fast, so soon.
    <br>It felt like just yesterday was the new millennium, 2000 and now it's 2019
    <br>and next year it's 2020. Time is running! Time is moving!
    <br>What are you doing?
    <br>We cannot afford to remain the same.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I cannot afford to remain the same".
    <br>2019 is a time for us to end this pretence, to stop this charade,
    <br>to get God's opinion of ourselves and others, to know who we are in Christ
    <br>because many of us still do not know who we really are.
    <br>This will bring us to the title of today's message: IDENTITY CRISIS
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and say, "Neighbour, if you want to be Christian, be a Christian".
    <br>But it is nonsense to confess Jesus and behave in a contrary manner.
    <br>Now, let's turn in our Bibles to the Book of 1 Thessalonians
    <br>which is the proof text for today's message.
    <br>1 Thessalonians 2:3-6
    <br>This is Apostle Paul speaking.
    <br>"For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives,
    <br>nor are we trying to trick you.
    <br>On the contrary, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel.
    <br>We are not trying to please people but God who tests our hearts."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, God tests my heart to reward me".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, God tests my heart to give me according to my efforts".
    <br>So, take care of your heart.
    <br>Verse 5.
    <br>"You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed - God is our witness.
    <br>We were not looking for praise from people, not from you or anyone else..."
    <br>Many people today put on a mask to cover up because they are more interested
    <br>in pleasing people than pleasing God.
    <br>This leads to an identity crisis.
    <br>What do I mean by this?
    <br>Identity crisis - we don't know who we are.
    <br>Our standards are oftentimes set by our environment.
    <br>Our standards as Christians seem to be shifting according to our circumstance.
    <br>When you are in a certain environment, there are things you can say, do and behave in this way.
    <br>When you go to another environment, you behave in a different way.
    <br>What is going on? Identity crisis!
    <br>We need to put an end to this.
    <br>Let me just quickly try and show you the fallacy of identity crisis.
    <br>Good Morning, sir. How are you, sir?
    <br>- What is your name, sir?
    <br>- Hillary.
    <br>Hillary, my name is Chris. Good to meet you, Hillary.
    <br>Good Morning, madam. What is your name?
    <br>Eladi.
    <br>Eladi, wonderful. My name is Stephen. Good to meet you.
    <br>Hello, sir. What is your name, sir?
    <br>Gabriel.
    <br>Gabriel, my name is Chukwu Emeka.
    <br>Good Morning, sir. How are you?
    <br>Good Morning, sir. My name is Tony Ecre.
    <br>What's going on?
    <br>I just introduced myself to four different people with different names!
    <br>I'm Chris, I'm Stephen, I'm Chukwu Emeka.
    <br>Identity crisis!
    <br>Try to paraphrase this and look at this in terms of our daily life.
    <br>So many of us behave in a certain way when we are with certain people.
    <br>Perhaps we are in the church; we know how to behave when we are in the church.
    <br>When we go to a different environment and we move with different people,
    <br>we behave in a different way.
    <br>Trying to please God today, please man tomorrow.
    <br>Please God on Sunday, please man ...
    <br>Identity crisis!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Stop that nonsense".
    <br>Now, can I quickly get two volunteers. Please, just from here, two volunteers.
    <br>Don't worry, it's very simple, you can come out.
    <br>Madam will come out and sir; thank you so much.
    <br>Okay, sir.
    <br>Madam, come out.
    <br>This is a very, very easy example to follow.
    <br>Madam you are going to represent God, congratulations.
    <br>Help me come and stand just here, and you will be facing this way.
    <br>Sir, come with me.
    <br>Let's go all the way over here.
    <br>Alright, sir. Thank you very much. Turn around.
    <br>Now, sir, I am very sorry, you are going to represent the opposite of God.
    <br>- Who is the opposite of God?
    <br>- Satan.
    <br>You are the one that said it, not me.
    <br>I'm not saying he is satan, he is not satan.
    <br>But for this example, you are going to represent satan.
    <br>Don't worry, you don't have to do anything; just look evil.
    <br>Now as Christians, we are on a journey.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "A journey".
    <br>Our journey is a journey of faith - learning more about Jesus,
    <br>knowing more about Jesus, becoming stronger in our battle with temptation,
    <br>pushing ahead in telling the lost about Jesus.
    <br>It is a journey we are on.
    <br>Faith is our movement towards God.
    <br>We are not supposed to be looking in this direction.
    <br>We are supposed to be on this journey towards God -
    <br>understanding more about Him, drawing closer to Him and being more sensitive to His voice.
    <br>That is the journey we are on!
    <br>Dying to sin more and more, living to righteousness more and more,
    <br>dying to pride more and more, living to humility more and more.
    <br>That is supposed to be our Christian journey but what many people are doing today: Identity crisis!
    <br>One moment we are looking towards God and we are doing the right thing,
    <br>we are worshiping Him, we are doing what is His will.
    <br>The next moment, we are going towards the world,
    <br>trying to identify ourselves with the ways of the world,
    <br>trying to compare ourselves with others.
    <br>Then we come back to our senses.
    <br>Maybe we come to church on Sunday, we turn around again, move this way and go towards God.
    <br>What will happen if you continue to go around in circles?
    <br>God today, the world tomorrow. God here, the world there.
    <br>What will happen? - Headache.
    <br>At the end of the day, our age is increasing but our spiritual life remains stagnant.
    <br>Each time you act on the Word of God, something enters your spirit that increases your assurance -
    <br>"I am a child of God."
    <br>On the contrary, each time you act outside the Word,
    <br>something enters your spirit that increases your doubt.
    <br>"Does God really love me? Is this plan for me really true?
    <br>Are you sure that He can do it?"
    <br>Each time that we give in to greed or we succumb to selfish desires
    <br>or we let lust lead or we begin to feed on the poison of envy,
    <br>drink the poison of jealousy - what happens?
    <br>Something enters our spirits that causes us to question our sonship,
    <br>doubt who we are.
    <br>We start our journey towards the world.
    <br>Remember, when I talk about satan -
    <br>this world is under satan's control.
    <br>By trying to identify ourselves with the ways of the world,
    <br>we find ourselves moving steadily in the wrong direction.
    <br>The closer we get, the more we doubt who we are in Christ,
    <br>the more our identity crisis increases because we don't know who we are.
    <br>As some of us, what we try and do, we say: let me sit on the fence,
    <br>let me try and get the best of both worlds.
    <br>I don't want to offend people; I don't want to offend God.
    <br>Let me just try and sit on the fence.
    <br>We try and sit on the fence.
    <br>But what you don't realise, people of God, is that any time you try and sit on the fence...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you think you are sitting on the fence, you have already fallen off.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There's confusion because we are trying to go towards God, please God
    <br>and go back to the world, and back to God.
    <br>In 2019, this must end.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me just tell you a strange mystery.
    <br>It is difficult to comprehend.
    <br>The Scriptures tell us that as Christians we are in the world
    <br>but we are not part of them.
    <br>Why then do we use the standard or the yardstick of the world to measure who we are?
    <br>You think you've made it when you have money, popularity, fame?
    <br>We are Christians - these are not the things that we use to determine our genuineness.
    <br>It's not external resources; it's internal resources.
    <br>Do you know what identifies you as a Christian?
    <br>Peace of conscience, ease of heart, internal joy
    <br>freedom from fear, assurance of life, security of God's presence -
    <br>these are the qualities that make us Christians.
    <br>You see a man of God with the biggest congregation - that does not attest to our genuineness.
    <br>You say, "I have this X amount of branches or you have Y amount of this",
    <br>and you have so much money and you showcase your cars, this and that.
    <br>Why are we using the yardstick of the world to measure who we are in Christ?
    <br>Identity crisis.
    <br>Thank you very much, Mr Opposite of God.
    <br>Come and take an altar fruit to compensate.
    <br>Thank you very much, madam. You did a very godly job there.
    <br>So come and take an altar fruit to compensate.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I hope you understand what I'm trying to say, people of God.
    <br>I hope you can relate with what I'm...
    <br>Wow. She is God, we cannot question her.
    <br>Take it, madam, it is yours.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me tell you the danger of identifying yourself,
    <br>using the world and the standards of the world as a yardstick.
    <br>Do you know that if you identify yourself through the world, you can never be content
    <br>because the standards of the world can never be met.
    <br>The criteria of the world can never be fulfilled.
    <br>No matter how gifted you are, look around - there is someone more gifted than you.
    <br>No matter how beautiful you are - you have beauty, handsome appearance -
    <br>look around - there is someone more beautiful than you.
    <br>No matter how intelligent, smart you are, just look around -
    <br>you will find someone smarter than you.
    <br>You will continue to compare yourself with others,
    <br>striving to please people that cannot be satisfied.
    <br>That's why we should be careful with who we celebrate.
    <br>You see today the world lifting up and celebrating the celebrities, stars,
    <br>movie actors, musicians.
    <br>Before you celebrate them, look behind the scenes.
    <br>Go beyond the make-up.
    <br>Look past the glitz and glamour and then ask yourself if you really want to idolise these people.
    <br>I want to tell you something today:
    <br>If you see anyone who is great in the eyes of the world, without God's character,
    <br>don't admire them; pray for them.
    <br>You see someone that is great, excelling in their natural gift without God's character -
    <br>don't envy them, compare yourself with them or say, "I want to be like them".
    <br>Pray for them because the beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>Let me share with you a word of wisdom that Prophet T.B. Joshua imparted into my life
    <br>and I thank God daily for the grace to be under the mentorship of someone like Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He said and I remember it so vividly,
    <br>"Don't let your gift go to your head.
    <br>Don't let your talent deceive you.
    <br>Gift begins, character finishes".
    <br>I hope you understand what I'm saying, brethren.
    <br>Don't be carried away by your skill, talent or gift.
    <br>Gift begins, character finishes.
    <br>If you see someone who is great without God's character - check the end:
    <br>Your exit will be remembered longer than your entry.
    <br>My gift, your gift does not identify who you are.
    <br>You are not who you are because of your gifts, your external, natural gifts. No!
    <br>Your identity lies in the Giver of your gift.
    <br>Your identity lies in the Owner of your gift.
    <br>Your identity lies in the Source of your gift - Jesus.
    <br>Therefore, celebrate Jesus in your gift.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, celebrate Jesus in your gift".
    <br>I'm not trying to tell you that you should not exercise your gift, talent, skill.
    <br>Yes, of course you could. But many people are gifted today and they are using it for the world.
    <br>Gifted by God and using it for the world.
    <br>Celebrate Jesus in your gift because your identity is not found in your appearance.
    <br>My appearance does not define who I am.
    <br>My possessions, position, money does not define who I am.
    <br>If you think your money defines who you are, you will want to get money at all costs -
    <br>no matter the cost.
    <br>You are ready to steal, kill and destroy just to get money.
    <br>If you think money defines you, money will defile you!
    <br>You think your appearance defines you -
    <br>our appearance does not define us; our appearance is just a shell.
    <br>Real me, true me lies in the heart.
    <br>You see people today - they are spending so much money on their appearance.
    <br>You see people that are fair, they want to look darker;
    <br>people that are dark want to look fairer - what is going on?
    <br>What is going on? Instead of us to be content with the way God created us,
    <br>you want to add something here - you see people today go for surgery,
    <br>they add something here, they add something there, what is going on?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fake here, fake here, fake here.
    <br>There is so much fake and you wonder why your life is fake. 
    <br>Look, I'm not saying, "Don't care for your appearance"; look after your appearance.
    <br>But your appearance does not define who you are.
    <br>Your possessions do not define who you are.
    <br>Your money, position, wealth, fame and gifts do not define who you are.
    <br>Let me tell you, brethren:
    <br>You are what God says you are!
    <br>You have what God says you have!
    <br>You can do what God says you can do!
    <br>That forms your identity.
    <br>How do we know Christians?
    <br>Christians have joy in the effort whatever the result because our worth comes from God.
    <br>Say after me this prayer:
    <br>Lord, give me joy in the effort whatever the result
    <br>because my worth, identity, value comes from You.
    <br>As Christians, we have joy irrespective of the result.
    <br>Whether our prayers are answered or not, I have joy as a Christian.
    <br>Whether I experience the rewards of my effort or not, I have joy as a Christian.
    <br>My peace is not conditioned by my circumstance.
    <br>Come rain, come shine, I have peace.
    <br>Whether I eat salad or bitter leaf, I have peace.
    <br>That is Christianity.
    <br>My life is not built by what people say about me.
    <br>People may say this, people may say that.
    <br>The same people that said, "Hallelujah! Hosanna!",
    <br>the same people said, "Crucify him!"
    <br>Whether they praise me or condemn me, that does not define who I am.
    <br>My life is not built on what people say.
    <br>My life is not built on people's opinions.
    <br>My life is not built on what the world says, the world's standards,
    <br>the society's standards. No!
    <br>I am what God says I am.
    <br>Until you can settle this truth in your heart, you will continue to have identity crisis -
    <br>trying to run up and down to please man, money, materials, possessions, position
    <br>and at the same time, you are displeasing your destiny,
    <br>robbing yourself of the opportunity to become who God has destined you to be in this world.
    <br>Brethren, I don't know what you are facing.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, perhaps you've been told that you are not good enough,
    <br>you will never make it, you are not smart enough, 
    <br>you are not beautiful enough, you are not handsome enough,
    <br>you are not gifted or talented enough.
    <br>Perhaps you have been told, you will never make it, you are destined for failure.
    <br>Let me tell you something: That is nothing more than a lie from the devil.
    <br>A lie from the pit of hell.
    <br>Stop listening to the lies of the world and start turning to the truth of God's Word.
    <br>Whatever situation you face, God has the answer.
    <br>If you are troubled today, God says to you in Isaiah 43:2
    <br>that when you pass through the water, He is with you.
    <br>When you walk through the fire, you will not be burnt.
    <br>That is what the Scriptures say.
    <br>If you are feeling alone today, the Bible says in Psalm 139:5-7 that
    <br>He hems you in around and before. Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Where can you flee from His Spirit. He is with you.
    <br>If you are feeling afraid or lost today, what does God say?
    <br>God says to you in Psalm 23:4 that, even though you walk through the valley
    <br>of the shadow of death, He is with you.
    <br>If you are sick today, God says to you in Isaiah 53:5 that by His wounds you are healed.
    <br>If you are weak today, God says to you in Psalm 27:1 that He is the strength of your life,
    <br>your light and salvation.
    <br>If you are feeling defeated today, God says to you in Romans 8:37
    <br>that you are more than a conqueror through Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you once felt close to God and you are now feeling distant, God says to you in Romans 8:39
    <br>that nothing can separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.
    <br>You are facing lack or want today, God says to you in Philippians 4:19 that
    <br>He will supply all your needs according to the glory of His riches in Christ Jesus.
    <br>If you think your problem has finished you, your circumstance has ended you,
    <br>your trouble has finished you,
    <br>God says to you in John 19:30 that it is finished!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If God be for you, who can be against you?
    <br>If God be for a nation, who can be against her?
    <br>Why are we looking for identity in the world when it is available in Christ?
    <br>In conclusion, brethren:
    <br>Let the Word of God become the database for your personal opinion.
    <br>Whatever comes your way, go back to God.
    <br>Whatever they say about me, I go back to God.
    <br>Whatever temptation comes my way - back to God.
    <br>Whatever happens, whatever comes - back to God and His Word.
    <br>God and His Word can never fail.
    <br>God's Word cannot fail; His promises are true.
    <br>His Word is going to say the same thing yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Remember who you are.
    <br>You are a child of God.
    <br>You are a new creation.
    <br>You are a branch of the Vine.
    <br>You are an heir of God.
    <br>You and Christ are one.
    <br>He is the greater part of that one.
    <br>Greater is He that is in you than all the forces of the adversary.
    <br>You with God are the majority; you can never be conquered.
    <br>You can never be defeated; you are a child of God.
    <br>Never for a moment acknowledge that God's ability cannot see you through.
    <br>Never for a moment doubt God's ability or desire to help you.
    <br>He is there to see you through whatever life brings.
    <br>So brethren, I repeat once again:
    <br>If you want to be a Christian, be a Christian.
    <br>But it is nonsense to confess Jesus and still try to please the world.
    <br>It is nonsense to confess Jesus and still engage in activities that don't glorify Him.
    <br>It is nonsense to confess Jesus and yet behave in a different way
    <br>when you are with different people or in a different environment.
    <br>It's nonsense.
    <br>Stop that nonsense.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
