    <br>There is a young couple - your wife beats you all the time.
    <br>Come out.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>My name is Ogbe Emmanuel.
    <br>I'm the one the man of God prophesied about that his wife always beats him.
    <br>Each time I and my wife have a little quarrel or I want to correct her,
    <br>she will not listen to me.
    <br>Just a little correction - she would beat me.
    <br>Two months ago, she beat me on the mouth and blood started gushing out.
    <br>She does not have affection for me.
    <br>Since I married her in 2015, I have never felt like a married man.
    <br>How does a married man feel?
    <br>They feel happy with their wives.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>So, she used to beat you.
    <br>Yes. Very well, Man of God.
    <br>My name is Obiora Edith.
    <br>You used to beat your husband.
    <br>Yes, whenever I am angry, I slap him.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Most of the time, I get angry when I am close to him. I don't know why.
    <br>Get close to him and see whether you will be angry.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our names are Mr and Mrs Obiora Emmanuel.
    <br>We thank God for the deliverance that God has given us last week, Sunday.
    <br>Last week Sunday, during the mass prayer, the man of God prophesied and pointed to my area.
    <br>He said there was a young couple over there and the wife always beat the man.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I thought about it for a minute because I knew what was happening in my home.
    <br>Immediately, I jumped up from my seat.
    <br>You are so happy, laughing and smiling today.
    <br>Yes, I'm very happy because I know that I'm free.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>The man of God said that we are young.
    <br>As you can see, I'm young and my wife is very, very young as well.
    <br>I married in the year 2015 and to be frank with you, just as I tried to explain to the man of God,
    <br>I never tasted what you would call a happy home.
    <br>Before I married my wife, I was brought up in a Christian home
    <br>and always tried to follow the laws of God.
    <br>I prepared myself for this marriage.
    <br>There were many women and girls around me
    <br>but I separated myself from them for one year in order to look for a good partner.
    <br>I remembered this fine, beautiful lady over here.
    <br>I decided to give her a phone call.
    <br>I called her for the first time and asked her, "Will you marry me? Can you be my wife?"
    <br>I married my wife and trouble started.
    <br>At the time, my wife was just a young lady; she had just finished secondary school.
    <br>As we moved into our house, she would be on social media, always with her phone - busy.
    <br>She had no time for me and I talked to her about it.
    <br>I asked her to leave the phone for some time so we could talk and reason as husband and wife.
    <br>I begged her but she refused to listen.
    <br>I told her that what she was doing, I also knew how to do it very well.
    <br>If I started my own, it would be fire.
    <br>She refused; I gave her time to stop but she refused so then, I started my own.
    <br>I brought out my new phone, downloaded WhatsApp, social media and Facebook.
    <br>See friend requests from ladies - fine ones.
    <br>As I started my own, it became fire.
    <br>Nobody was listening to each other anymore.
    <br>Ok, let me forget that one.
    <br>This happened immediately after we got married.
    <br>More especially this year.
    <br>That's when I developed another habit of drinking alcohol.
    <br>What caused that was too much disrespect - beating me in the sense that I could not talk.
    <br>If I talked once, she would reply me twenty times.
    <br>If I tried to calm her down as a husband and come near her to ask what the problem was,
    <br>she would slap me.
    <br>I thank God for being in The SCOAN today because I have been yearning to come here
    <br>because I knew the man of God was the only one who could solve this problem.
    <br>I thank God for what happened last Sunday.
    <br>After the prophecy, I'm very happy with my wife.
    <br>Yesterday as we were walking, she held my hand.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Can you demonstrate what you are saying.
    <br>Like this.
    <br>You mean, it was strange?
    <br>It was strange.
    <br>And she was not looking ashamed; she was just focusing on me.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>And you can see now...
    <br>If you saw how we were sitting there,
    <br>when she got tired, she would rest her head on my shoulder.
    <br>I'm very happy.
    <br>So you mean, she never used to do all this before?
    <br>All these things - before, I did not deserve them.
    <br>Instead it was beating...
    <br>Yes, if she mistakenly did this and then realised it, she would say, "No, you don't deserve it!"
    <br>But I thank God today that I deserve all this.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our names are Mr and Mrs Obiora Emmanuel.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God gave us a prophecy.
    <br>It was after the mass prayer; I was sitting on the chair,
    <br>resting my head on the chair in front of me
    <br>when I heard, "There is a couple here. The wife always beats".
    <br>I was like, "Who does that?" I raised up my head to know who the person was.
    <br>Then I looked beside me and found out that my husband was no longer
    <br>sitting beside me - so it was me.
    <br>I was telling myself, "I'm not going out, unless all the ushers will come and carry me out.
    <br>I can't see myself standing here. For what now?"
    <br>I don't know what made me to just carry my bag.
    <br>The two couples sitting next to me - they were big, heavy -
    <br>before one could pass them, one would have to say, "Excuse me".
    <br>I found out that the space was big for me to pass.
    <br>When I came to the front, that is when I realised where I was.
    <br>I became more angry like "What is this man saying?"
    <br>I was so angry at my husband again.
    <br>After the prayer last Sunday, I now see my husband as my husband, unlike before.
    <br>Whenever I was close to him, I was always sweating; I don't know why.
    <br>Even if it was under aircondition, I would always sweat.
    <br>One day I asked him, "Don't you think it was a mistake getting married to you?
    <br>See how I am sweating when I'm together with you - imagine that".
    <br>And then he said, "You are not normal".
    <br>And then I realised, truly, I wasn't normal
    <br>because I had a spiritual husband, which I knew.
    <br>I kept praying.
    <br>I thank God that after everything, I came here and I was delivered.
    <br>Praise be to the Lord Jesus!
    <br>How did you beat your husband?
    <br>Whenever I was angry - everything he did was negative; I didn't see anything positive in him.
    <br>Only when he was not around, I would be seeing good.
    <br>I would think, "This man is really a good man".
    <br>But whenever he came back...
    <br>I would be seeing another person.
    <br>Whenever he was talking to me, I would think, "Why is he giving me this advice".
    <br>Instead of listening to his advice, I would be remembering all I had gone through
    <br>and I would just be like, "Leave me alone!"
    <br>I would just slap him - I would not know where the hand hit him.
    <br>Sometimes I would not even know that I beat him; I would ask, "Did I hit you?"
    <br>He would say, "No, you didn't hit me".
    <br>I thank God for today. Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>Thank you.
