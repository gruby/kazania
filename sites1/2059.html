    <br>There is fire in the house.
    <br>For you to be included, you must let your offence go.
    <br>When you hold an offence in your heart, you are not included.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you hold an offence in your heart, you are not included".
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>When you hold an offence in your heart, you are not included.
    <br>I can't hear you
    <br>When you hold an offence in your heart, you are not included.
    <br>There is miracle, healing, deliverance going on.
    <br>There is blessing going on.
    <br>Greater blessing, salvation, deliverance, breakthrough - it is moving around.

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Right now, be open to the Spirit of God.
    <br>Yes, He wants to contact you.
    <br>He's concerned about you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Jesus is concerned about me".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Jesus is concerned about me.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Jesus is concerned about me.
    <br>He wants you to be like any apostle He has created.
    <br>He is concerned about you; He loves you.
    <br>He loves you so much - more than you love yourself.
    <br>Jesus loves you - more than you love yourself.
    <br>He is concerned about you.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Right now, begin to take your career, business from where it is now to where Jesus wants it to be.
    <br>Open your lips right now, by faith, take your business, career, finances
    <br>from where they are now, to where Jesus wants them to be.
    <br>PRAYER THAT DEFEATS DEMONS With Prophet TB Joshua!!!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I command breakthrough to your life!
    <br>Your business - breakthrough!
    <br>Your career - breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>Your effort - breakthrough!
    <br>Your attempt - breakthrough!
    <br>Your desire - breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I want to hear you shout, "Breakthrough!".
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>You know, Jesus is not a man that lies.
    <br>If He says "Yes", no one can say "No",
    <br>and if He says "No", no one can say "Yes".
    <br>Jesus says, "Breakthrough!"
    <br>I just want to see your belief.
    <br>Jesus says, "Breakthrough!"
    <br>Your belief is your response.
    <br>I say, "Breakthrough!"
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>PRAYER THAT DEFEATS DEMONS With Prophet TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>Believing is our connection.
    <br>"Just believe and you shall be saved," says the Lord.
    <br>That belief is your response.
    <br>At this moment, out there, you can respond to anything and you don't really mean it.
    <br>You may shout, "Hallelujah!" out there, but you don't really mean it.
    <br>But at this moment, in His presence, He is concerned about your response.
    <br>Whatever you say, so shall it be.
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>PRAYER THAT DEFEATS DEMONS With Prophet TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>I can hear from the Spirit of God.
    <br>He said to me that I should say to you, "Just believe!".
    <br>He is not saying, "Believe".
    <br>He says, "Just believe!".
    <br>You know there is a difference between 'just believe' and 'believe'.
    <br>He is begging you now.
    <br>He says, "Just believe!"
    <br>Just believe: so shall it be, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>Think about that:
    <br>If Jesus is saying, "Just believe!" He is concerned about you.
    <br>He knows you.
    <br>He knows your disposition.
    <br>He knows you are weak.
    <br>He wants to be your strength.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Just believe!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>"Just believe!"
    <br>Tell the viewers all over the world -
    <br>"Just believe!"
    <br>In this case now, no one will leave here without being delivered.
    <br>If Jesus could say, "Just believe!"
    <br>- He is not saying, "Believe!" -
    <br>He says, "Just believe!".
    <br>He is begging you.
    <br>He is telling you, "Just believe!"
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>What is your response now?
    <br>"Just believe!"
    <br>Just believe!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Just believe!"
    <br>Viewers all over the world, just believe!
    <br>Just believe!
    <br>Jesus says to you, "Just believe!"
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>Thank you.
