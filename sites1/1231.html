    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Give your neighbour behind you a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Give your neighbour in front of you a handshake and say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Good Morning!"
    <br>You are all welcome again in Jesus' name.
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Chris.
    <br>Before I begin today’s message, I want to first and foremost pay tribute to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>who is a man I have the incredible privilege to call a mentor.
    <br>I came to Nigeria from the UK many, many years ago as a young boy seeking for Jesus
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua showed me Jesus.
    <br>Not the Jesus of history, of story, of song, the baby Jesus. No!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua showed me Jesus in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>He taught that the main requirements in making a difference for Jesus is being in love with Jesus.
    <br>This is what I see in Prophet T.B. Joshua – a man who loves Jesus
    <br>and has sacrificed and surrendered everything for his relationship with Jesus.
    <br>And that is why we are here today – because of his love.
    <br>He is a great man but his greatness lies not in great material achievements
    <br>or great acquisitions or great wealth.
    <br>No! His greatness lies in his great love for God.
    <br>Here I am today, a product of grace –
    <br>in many ways, still that same little boy who came here to serve a big God under a mighty prophet.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>I want to ask you a question as we go into today's message.
    <br>Are you happy to be here today?
    <br>I'm not so sure. Let me ask again: Are you happy to be here today?
    <br>If you are happy, I would like you to turn to your neighbour and just give them a smile.
    <br>Camera, just move around and let's pick them very beautiful smiles.
    <br>Just smile at your neighbour. Give them a smile.
    <br>Just smile at your neighbour because it is a thing of joy to be here in the presence of God
    <br>and I pray that your joy will remain, in Jesus‘ name.
    <br>I want to tell you a very short story
    <br>in relation to the message God has given me to deliver to you today.
    <br>I’m sure people of this generation, our '‚www.com generation' may relate well to this story.
    <br>I will just tell you what I saw.
    <br>This was several months ago when I was back in the UK.
    <br>I was sitting on a train and I saw two young ladies.
    <br>Just by their look, by their appearance, you could see that they were depressed.
    <br>They were sad; they were moody.
    <br>Just name it. It was so obvious.
    <br>Everything about them suggested sadness.
    <br>These were two ladies you could see who were not materially lacking.
    <br>They were using the latest phone, the latest gadget.
    <br>They were well looked after but they were sad; they were depressed.
    <br>I was overhearing their conversation and I was feeling in my heart,
    <br>God look at these two young ladies in their early 20’s, late teenage years.
    <br>They had their whole life before them but they were so depressed.
    <br>You look at our generation today, you see sadness, depression has spread like wildfire,
    <br>especially among young people.
    <br>You hear the way in which suicide rates are increasing. It is alarming.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It is alarming".
    <br>As I was watching these two young ladies – I was there going on a journey –
    <br>I was looking at these two young ladies and I saw something that shocked me.
    <br>It was very surprising.
    <br>These were two people that looked extremely sad.
    <br>I won't be able to show that expression because...
    <br>Can anyone here just give me a sad face?
    <br>I'm sorry; I know we have just been happy.
    <br>Can someone give me a sad face?
    <br>Just for a moment.
    <br>Alright. Our gentleman here looks a little bit sad.
    <br>Now just imagine...
    <br>Don't smile, sir.
    <br>Just imagine that you see someone looking sad.
    <br>Suddenly, one of them got out their phone and wanted to take a photo, a selfie.
    <br>Take a picture of yourself.
    <br>These are the people that are depressed, weighed down, clearly anxious, sad.
    <br>But suddenly, when they want to take the picture, you should see the smile on their face.
    <br>And then, you know the funny thing: Immediately after, they were sad again.
    <br>It was mind-boggling, "What is going on?"
    <br>And do you know the painful part of this?
    <br>They will put this picture on Instagram, Facebook, send it to their boyfriends.
    <br>People would think that they were happy; people would think that they were okay.
    <br>People would think that they were joyful whereas in reality, they were depressed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Please keep praying for this generation because we are living a fake life.
    <br>Our joy is for a moment. Our happiness is for a second.
    <br>We so often seem to have happiness or joy dependent on our circumstance, dependent on our situation.
    <br>That is when we see that happiness.
    <br>But I want to ask you a question.
    <br>Please, I am not here to make judgement on those two young ladies.
    <br>I pray that God will touch their hearts.
    <br>I just want to ask everyone here a question.
    <br>When you finish your day’s work, you go home and it is time for you to sleep.
    <br>You had a long day, you are tired and you lay back down on your bed.
    <br>And it is just you and God.
    <br>The lights are off. The doors are closed.
    <br>The activities of the day have come to a halt.
    <br>You are there laying on your bed, reflecting, thinking.
    <br>At that moment, do you have joy?
    <br>You are looking up at the ceiling.
    <br>There is no one there – just you.
    <br>At that moment, do you have joy?
    <br>Can you laugh without anyone cracking a joke, dance without anyone beating a drum?
    <br>Or at that moment, do you feel empty?
    <br>The reason why I’m asking this question today:
    <br>I am here to warn you about the dangers of sadness.
    <br>Whenever you are sad, the devil is at work.
    <br>A sad heart is the devil’s workshop.
    <br>He can manoeuvre, he can manipulate,
    <br>he can sow his seeds of chaos, destruction, division, discord.
    <br>He has free reign and rule in your heart as far as you are sad.
    <br>When you harbour sadness in your heart, you filter everything through it.
    <br>When you are sad, you can abandon jobs, quit relationships –
    <br>you don’t give your best; you live below your potential.
    <br>You begin to nurse suspicions.
    <br>You read meanings into people’s actions and inactions.
    <br>If someone greets you today, you say, "Why are they greeting me?"
    <br>If someone does not greet you, you say, "Why are they not greeting me?"
    <br>Whether they are greeting or not greeting, you read meaning into it.
    <br>You are suspicious; everyone becomes a suspect because your heart is sad.
    <br>You can’t pray. A sad heart can’t pray.
    <br>You may say words but you’re not praying prayer.
    <br>People around you may hear you but you’re talking to the air; God doesn’t hear you.
    <br>Your heart is sad.
    <br>Whenever you are sad, the devil is at work.
    <br>When you are sad, you begin to view yourself as a victim.
    <br>„Why is this happening to me?
    <br>Why am I the one facing this? Why me? Where is God?
    <br>Look at this person – God has blessed him, why not me? Me, me, me, I, I, I, why, why, why?“
    <br>Focusing on ourselves is the effective instrument used by the devil to blind us from reality.
    <br>Do you know what the reality is, children of God?
    <br>The reality is, Jesus is the anchor of our souls
    <br>and when you remain anchored on Him, attached to Him, connected to Him,
    <br>no matter how unsteady your life appears to be, you will remain steady.
    <br>Satan knows this.
    <br>So, what’s going to happen?
    <br>Satan will fight you tooth and nail.
    <br>He will use every weapon at his disposal to try and detach you from Jesus,
    <br>to try and disconnect you from Jesus because remaining attached to Jesus –
    <br>that is where our safety lies, that is where our security lies, that is where our protection lies.
    <br>Unhappiness is the weapon satan is using to detach us from Jesus.
    <br>This brings us to the title of today’s message: CHEER UP AND CHOOSE JOY.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Cheer up and choose joy".
    <br>Tell your other neighbour, "Cheer up and choose joy".
    <br>Let us turn to our Bible to the Book of John 15:11.
    <br>This is our Lord Jesus Christ speaking to His disciples.
    <br>"I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.“
    <br>For our joy to be complete, it must be God’s joy.
    <br>Joy is something only believers have.
    <br>The world may have happiness they find in their environment.
    <br>Just like those two young ladies.
    <br>They were happy for a moment and back to sadness.
    <br>Joyful for a moment - back to depression.
    <br>That is the world.
    <br>If your happiness is created by the flesh, it will be interrupted by the flesh.
    <br>If you say, "Let me create happiness for myself, I will do this.
    <br>Let me drink alcohol“ – the effects of alcohol will soon wear off. Back again.
    <br>You say to yourself, "Let me read this book, this novel, this fantasy“.
    <br>You get lost in another world, forgetting about your troubles.
    <br>The book will soon end.
    <br>You watch a film, a soap opera. You watch and you are happy at that moment.
    <br>The film will come to an end – back to reality.
    <br>Happiness you create for yourself can’t last; it cannot stand the test of time.
    <br>Joy is something only believers have because joy is a fruit of faith.
    <br>Let’s turn to another scripture.
    <br>Philippians 4:4: "Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!“
    <br>Does it say there that you should rejoice sometimes, at your convenient time,
    <br>when there is money in your pocket, when there is food on the table, when you take a picture?
    <br>No, rejoice in the Lord always.
    <br>Check yourself.
    <br>Whenever our joy seeps out and leaves us barren and empty,
    <br>it proves we are out of contact with God, out of fellowship with God.
    <br>You begin to see your joy gradually leaving, disappearing, seeping away.
    <br>It shows something has happened that has detached you from Jesus – sadness, unhappiness.
    <br>This is exactly what satan wants.
    <br>Satan’s main aim in tempting people of God is to overthrow their position as children of God,
    <br>to cut off their dependence on Him, their duty to Him, their communion with Him.
    <br>Satan delights in inflicting pain on people
    <br>because he knows that pain may likely separate you from God,
    <br>rob you of your joy, rob you of your happiness – that is the devil’s tactic.
    <br>Just take time to think about your life.
    <br>Any time good news has come, satan will send you some bad news.
    <br>Am I talking to someone here? You can check yourself.
    <br>Any time there is joy, something wonderful has happened,
    <br>satan will quickly send someone to give you some bad news.
    <br>He will send you a text message, give you a phone call that will try and scatter your joy.
    <br>For many of us, it happened coming to church this morning.
    <br>We are on the way to church, happy, joyful, it is going to be a wonderful service.
    <br>Suddenly, the phone just rings.
    <br>"What happened?"
    <br>"Oga, one of your vehicles is spoilt on the road.
    <br>The vehicle is a write-off."
    <br>You say, "Oh my God! I'm on my way to church.
    <br>The vehicle is spoilt. What is going on?
    <br>God, do you know I'm coming to worship you?
    <br>I'm coming to T.B. Joshua. You go and spoil my vehicle?
    <br>Which kind of nonsense is this?"
    <br>Many of you will turn back and not even come to church.
    <br>Some of you will come to church and as you are sitting down,
    <br>you are busy plotting revenge.
    <br>The sermon is going on but you are not listening.
    <br>You think, "How am I going to pay for this? How am I going to take care of this?
    <br>That driver who was in that vehicle - I'm going to deal with him!
    <br>Just let the church service come to an end so that I finish it!"
    <br>And you are in the church!
    <br>Sadness has taken over.
    <br>Any time there is happiness, there is joy, there is peace, satan will try and send some bad news.
    <br>Just imagine - you heard prophecies here.
    <br>Husband and wife looking for a child for so many years - suddenly the pregnancy comes.
    <br>There is rejoicing in the home, there is happiness, joy.
    <br>Suddenly, a text message comes in from an anonymous person.
    <br>"I saw your wife at the club last month with a man.
    <br>Are you sure that baby is yours?"
    <br>They never sent that text message when your wife was not pregnant.
    <br>Why now when there is joy, peace, rejoicing?
    <br>Suddenly, someone will try to inflict pain.
    <br>Someone will try to bring bad news.
    <br>The problem is, so often we make it easy for the devil – we take what we hear without questioning.
    <br>You take that text message and say, "Yes, this my wife; she has committed adultery.
    <br>She is this" - you don't even examine to know whether it is true.
    <br>You just believe.
    <br>Many divine marriages have been scattered because of sadness.
    <br>Many divine appointments - you are on your way to an appointment
    <br>that is going to change your life, rewrite your history.
    <br>Satan knows. He will send you bad news.
    <br>He will send you bad information to try and discourage you, to try and dishearten you.
    <br>And many of us give up at the peak of breakthrough.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Cheer up and choose joy".
    <br>I want to try and practically demonstrate to you the dangers of sadness.
    <br>Can I have one volunteer?
    <br>Ok, thank you, sir.
    <br>Sir, I'm very sorry. You are Mr Sadness.
    <br>Yes, I am.
    <br>Now, to behave like Mr Sadness, you need to...
    <br>I think he is getting it. A little bit more sad, sir.
    <br>Thank you. Let's clap for Mr Sadness.
    <br>Just for a moment.
    <br>Mr Sadness, can you just quickly help me to go to the back.
    <br>There is an item there that you are going to make use of for this demonstration.
    <br>I just need a couple of chairs and table.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I just want to try and practicalise this so that people can understand the danger of sadness.
    <br>We don’t know – when we are allowing sadness into our heart, we are allowing destruction.
    <br>This is my house. Just for this example.
    <br>When I say my house, I mean my heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your heart".
    <br>Remember, the real part about you is your heart.
    <br>Take care of your heart. This is the most important part of us, our heart.
    <br>God never promised that situations would not come. Where did you read it in the Bible?
    <br>This doctrine of no suffering, no health challenges, no hardship, is not in line with the Bible.
    <br>It is not scriptural.
    <br>Where did you read that as a Christian, you can’t face challenges,
    <br>you can’t face difficulty, you can’t have bad news?
    <br>No! They come but we overcome.
    <br>Who told you that you would not have trouble? That is not scriptural.
    <br>Here I am. I am busy, sitting in my house.
    <br>Having a great day - there is joy, peace and happiness.
    <br>Suddenly, the phone rings.
    <br>There are some bad news.
    <br>"Dad, you have got to come quickly. Mum is so sick!“
    <br>"What? I just left her now. She was fine. What happened?“
    <br>"She is really really sick. Please make sure you come as soon as possible.“
    <br>Someone you left just yesterday, gone on a business trip and then they say that someone is sick.
    <br>Someone is crying; your heart is troubled.
    <br>At that moment, Mr Sadness comes in.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Look. I just had some bad news.
    <br>[Knocking.]
    <br>What does sadness do? It knocks at the door of your heart.
    <br>The question is: Will you open?
    <br>[Knocking.]
    <br>It knocks on the door. What will you do?
    <br>Will you let him in?
    <br>Now, in this example, I'm troubled, worried and Mr Sadness knocks.
    <br>"Oh, Mr Sadness, come in. Have a seat. Make yourself at home.“
    <br>Look. Mr Sadness did not come alone. He brought some items.
    <br>He brought some luggage.
    <br>So far as you make 'Mr Sadness' feel welcome, he will begin to relax in your heart.
    <br>He will begin to be relaxed and feel as if it is his own home.
    <br>As he does that, the items in his suitcase, he will begin to bring them out.
    <br>Alright. Just bring out some of these items, Mr Sadness.
    <br>Alright.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look. There are some more items there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want you to take a lesson from this.
    <br>The moment you allow sadness into your heart, he will begin the work of destruction.
    <br>Let me also be clear with you.
    <br>When sadness checks in, joy checks out.
    <br>The two cannot be in the same house. They are opposite.
    <br>There I am busy worrying about my wife that is sick; I'm troubled.
    <br>And before you know it, sadness starts dropping in some soap of strife,
    <br>toothpaste of past pain, shampoo of shame.
    <br>I’m not thinking about this, I’m busy worrying about my problem and Mr Sadness has started to infiltrate.
    <br>He started to deposit his evil companions.
    <br>And I don’t even know; I’m busy being sad, worrying, depressed.
    <br>Before you know it, shame, malice, greed, bitterness, cruelty
    <br>because you allowed sadness into your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, this is the painful part.
    <br>Most of us Christians come to our senses eventually.
    <br>Perhaps you are there and you suddenly remember a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>talking about the need for you not to focus on your situation but to focus on Jesus.
    <br>Suddenly it is as if your eyes open – you look and say, "What is this guy doing here?
    <br>Who let you into this house? Get out! Go!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now Mr Sadness has left but he has dropped his toothpaste.
    <br>Do you know what happens?
    <br>The next day, maybe it is time for you to brush your teeth.
    <br>You had a long day; you start brushing your teeth.
    <br>"Oh my God, I’m using the toothpaste of past pain!“
    <br>Sadness is gone but you are still using his products.
    <br>There is the journal of jealousy, the deodorant of discord – you are busy using it.
    <br>You don't know that you use something that contaminates your spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me take a bit of water to flush it down.
    <br>Bitterness – I have taken the water of bitterness!
    <br>Because I have kicked sadness out but he has left his products.
    <br>At this point, sadness has been in your heart and he has rigged his destruction, caused this mess.
    <br>You now need to start cleaning up, "Jesus, have mercy on me“.
    <br>You start repairing what has been damaged, "All of this trouble; no, it is not part of me!"
    <br>"Jealousy, I’m a child of God. What has jealousy got to do with me?“
    <br>"What is this discord? It has nothing to do with me!"
    <br>You throw everything away and start afresh.
    <br>"This bag is no longer part of me!“ Throw it away.
    <br>Your house is clean. Your heart is clean and free again.
    <br>Do you know what happens next?
    <br>"Brother, this thing is serious. The company has gone bankrupt. Your shares have all been lost.“
    <br>"Eh!"
    <br>"Not again! God, why?"
    <br>Do you know what happens at that moment?
    <br>There is a visitor that will approach.
    <br>A visitor will come who wants to start knocking once again.
    <br>"Oh God! I have invested so much in that company. What is going on?“
    <br>[Knocking.]
    <br>"Who is that?"
    <br>"Sadness."
    <br>"Wait a minute! Isn’t this the guy I just kicked out?
    <br>Isn’t this the guy that polluted my house and caused such a mess, chaos and destruction?
    <br>Isn't this the same guy?"
    <br>But do you know what many of us do?
    <br>"Oh, come on in, sir. Have a seat. Come on in, sadness.“
    <br>And now, he has brought another bag.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Mr Sadness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Mr Sadness, please come with me. I think we need to make you happy.
    <br>I think it is time to give you a new name; let's replace sadness with joy.
    <br>Come and take one of the altar fruits.
    <br>Yes, the sadness has gone now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you very much, my brother. You may have your seat.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>I want you to reflect on this example.
    <br>The cycle of life seems to go on because any time trouble comes, sadness comes back in.
    <br>He starts doing his damage, causing his destruction, wreaking his havoc.
    <br>When we allow him straight back in, anything we have done to repair the damage,
    <br>we ask Jesus, "Come and remove this", we have repaired, removed all of this bitterness,
    <br>removed the strife and past pain and then you invite him back in.
    <br>Does it not call for concern that we are so welcoming of something so destructive?
    <br>You know the damage that has been done; yet, you allow him straight back in.
    <br>Those items 'Mr Sadness‘ brought, I’m not referring to physical items
    <br>I’m referring to thoughts, suggestions.
    <br>By the time sadness is in your heart, you will see it will come with bitterness.
    <br>Sadness is in your heart – anger.
    <br>Sadness is in your heart – suggestion of pride.
    <br>Sadness is in your heart – suggestion of envy, malice, jealousy, things that are contrary to Jesus.
    <br>I want to give you a secret today – any time satan wants you to cry, begin to laugh.
    <br>This is the greatest embarrassment you can give to satan – to ignore his existence.
    <br>He comes with his bad news. You don’t even pay attention.
    <br>Nothing interrupts your joy; nothing disturbs your peace
    <br>because you know that when satan comes with bad news,
    <br>he is simply informing you of the promotion that is coming.
    <br>In the face of promotion, why is there need for sadness?
    <br>Where is sadness in overcoming and triumph?
    <br>When you know that what you are passing through will lead to your promotion, why are you sad?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Cheer up and choose joy".
    <br>There is a story in the Bible we know so well. I want to remind you of it.
    <br>The story of Paul and Silas.
    <br>Acts 16:25. They were beaten and imprisoned unjustly for the cause of Christ.
    <br>There they were in their prison cell at midnight
    <br>and the Bible says they began to sing hymns and pray to God and the other prisoners were listening.
    <br>Just consider the circumstances under which Paul and Silas began to sing and praise God.
    <br>They had been beaten unjustly.
    <br>They were doing the work of God.
    <br>Paul had just delivered that slave girl from the spirit disturbing her.
    <br>They had committed no crime and yet they found themselves in prison.
    <br>In the deepest, darkest, deadliest of dungeons.
    <br>If it was me or you, we would begin to remind God of how long we have been a Christian.
    <br>"God, I have been a member of this church for ten years!
    <br>Do you know how much tithe I have given?
    <br>Do you know how much offering I have given?
    <br>Do you know how many times I have fasted and prayed? Is this how you repay me?"
    <br>Sadness.
    <br>Paul and Silas were in prison physically but their hearts were free.
    <br>They praised God.
    <br>Satan may succeed in inflicting you with pain but don’t let him pain your heart.
    <br>He may succeed in tampering with your business, causing some financial challenges.
    <br>Don’t let him tamper with your heart.
    <br>Satan may succeed in imprisoning you; you may end up in prison for what you know nothing about.
    <br>Don’t let him imprison your spirit, your heart.
    <br>Take a leaf from Paul and Silas and in the face of life’s challenges,
    <br>life's bad news, life’s ups and downs, begin to sing and praise God.
    <br>Choose the bright colours of praise
    <br>rather than the dark colours of doubt, discouragement and depression.
    <br>I'm going to round up but I want to share with you a very personal expereince
    <br>that solidified and strengthened my faith to give such a message.
    <br>It was over 10 years ago.
    <br>This is an incidence that many of us that are new to Emmanuel TV might not be familiar with.
    <br>But if you have been in this church for many years, you will be aware of what happened.
    <br>Many years, over 10 years ago, Emmanuel TV was new, fresh, changing lives, nations and the world.
    <br>One day after the service on Sunday, it was in the early hours of Monday morning.
    <br>Around 2 to 3 am, we were all here in the church.
    <br>Suddenly came the alarm. I remember it very vividly.
    <br>Someone came to my bed and hit me and said, "There is fire!“
    <br>Everyone was scattered; there was pandemonium, worry, panic.
    <br>We rushed down.
    <br>The church console, the control room, the heart of Emmanuel TV was in flames.
    <br>Everyone started running up and down, getting water, trying to reduce the flames.
    <br>I was worried. At that moment, sadness had entered my heart.
    <br>I was distressed.
    <br>"God, this is equipment worth millions. What is going on? How could this happen?“
    <br>As everyone was busy, rushing to do this or that, I remember this so well –
    <br>I heard someone laughing and I was provoked.
    <br>"How can you laugh! This situation does not call for laughter, joy! This is a serious situation!“
    <br>The same person I heard laughing was asking people, „How are you?“, smiling and greeting people.
    <br>I looked round and I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He came to me, gave me a big smile and said, „How are you?“
    <br>I didn’t say anything.
    <br>I was shocked.
    <br>The situation on the ground did not call for that.
    <br>He was so relaxed, so joyful.
    <br>He was even calling people, "Make sure you bring a camera to camera it“.
    <br>"What? You have just lost equipment worth millions! Oh my God!
    <br>There was joy.
    <br>By the grace of God, everything was resolved; the fire didn’t spread anywhere else.
    <br>Afterwards, that morning, Prophet T.B. Joshua gathered all the evangelists and workers that were there
    <br>and said, "God allowed this and I knew it would happen“.
    <br>He said, "Out of these ashes will shine forth beauty“.
    <br>Today, our control room is ten times better than the one that was lost.
    <br>Why am I saying this, brethren?
    <br>This personal experience, example in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>I do not know what you are passing through right now.
    <br>Viewers, I don’t know what situation you are in.
    <br>Perhaps your marriage is on fire.
    <br>Perhaps your business is on fire.
    <br>Perhaps your finances are on fire.
    <br>One thing I do know, as a Christian, out of those ashes, beauty will come.
    <br>If you can just glimpse the bigger picture.
    <br>Beyond that trial, there is triumph.
    <br>Beyond that scar, there is a star.
    <br>Beyond that mess is a message.
    <br>If we could just catch the bigger picture.
    <br>Beyond that painful story is beautiful glory.
    <br>As a child of God, where then is sadness?
    <br>Why do we so easily give our hearts to sadness, depression, unhappiness as Christians?
    <br>In John 16:33 Jesus said, "In this world, you will have trouble but cheer up; take heart.
    <br>Choose joy because you will overcome“.
    <br>Brethren, let me not deceive you.
    <br>Trouble will come but you will overcome.
    <br>Sickness will come but you will overcome.
    <br>Hardship will come but you will overcome.
    <br>Stop trading your joy for your situation.
    <br>Don’t let anything rob you of joy – joy is our conquering power.
    <br>The joy of the Lord is our strength (Nehemiah 8:10).
    <br>Affliction may test me as a man of faith but it cannot rob me of my joy.
    <br>Trouble may test me as a man of faith but it cannot rob me of my joy
    <br>and when I cheer up and choose joy, my test will turn into a testimony.
    <br>I don’t know what tomorrow holds but I know who holds tomorrow.
    <br>Rejoice because the higher Hand that is leading you, is leading you to something higher.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus‘ name.
