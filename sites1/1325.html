  <p>    
    <br>There is a man there; he is a witchdoctor.
    <br>You came; you want to give your life to Jesus.
    <br>A witchdoctor, OK, you want me to call you a spiritualist.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Man of God, I am the witchdoctor; I brought the charms.
    <br>- You don't want to come out?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Go and bring the charms.
    <br>Following the prophecy of the man of God that a witchdoctor was in the Service,
    <br>this man came forward to confirm that he is not only a witchdoctor
    <br>but he even brought charms with him that were outside the church.
    <br>He quickly makes his way to where he had left the charms he used in his occultic work.
    <br>Lifting up the filthy charms and idols, the witchdoctor walks back to the church auditorium
    <br>to give his full confession.
    <br>My name is Okashe Wilson.
    <br>I am from Delta State.
    <br>The man of God prophesied that there was a witchdoctor and said he should come out.
    <br>Truly, I am a witchdoctor.
    <br>These are the charms and things I use in worshipping the idols.
    <br>The image I have in my left hand is my wife from the marine kingdom.
    <br>She is a snake and also a fish.
    <br>She normally appears to me in dreams and shows signs to me in the physical.
    <br>Sometimes, snakes would come and meet me in the physical; they'd come to my house.
    <br>And when snakes come to you to meet you in the physical, what happens?
    <br>When they come to me in the physical, they would tell me some certain things
    <br>and make a lot of promises, which they have not redeemed.
    <br>Whenever somebody brought a problem to me, I would lay the problem before the woman.
    <br>- Which woman?
    <br>- My spiritual wife.
    <br>When I said the problem to her, something would come over me.
    <br>Then, I would know what to do for the person.
    <br>Maybe the person wanted me to do a charm for them.
    <br>What kind of charms you normally do for the people that come to you?
    <br>I do charms for prostitutes so that men would like them
    <br>and whatever they ask men to do for them, they would do.
    <br>They would tell me that they want men to be after them.
    <br>Then, I would do a charm for them.
    <br>Sometimes, I did charms for them in the forms of rings.
    <br>I would ask them to wear the rings and whenever they wore the rings,
    <br>anything they told their men, they would do that for them.
    <br>I do charms for young boys and for men.
    <br>Tell us, how did you come about this charm you have
    <br>and for how many years have you been doing this job of a herbalist?
    <br>I have been doing it for four years now.
    <br>Can you tell us how you were initiated into this herbalism?
    <br>I went to a native doctor for solution and explained what I had been seeing in my dreams.
    <br>Then, he told me that I was supposed to be a herbalist.
    <br>He asked me to go and buy some things and start doing charms for people.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we see that he came here today for the first time
    <br>and during the mass prayer the man of God gave him this word of prophecy
    <br>that there was a man here who was a herbalist,
    <br>and the Spirit of God brought him out and finally he is here today.
    <br>After the prophecy and confession, Mr Okashe Wilson was delivered
    <br>by the power of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>after receiving prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua in Jesus' name.
    <br>After Deliverance Mr Wilson Prepares To Burn The Charms & Idols
    <br>My name is Wilson Okashe.
    <br>I am the person that the man of God prophesied to that there was a witchdoctor
    <br>in the congregation who should come out and Jesus loves me.
    <br>I came out and was delivered.
    <br>These are the charms that had been tormenting my life.
    <br>Right now, I am delivered and I am ready to destroy these things.
    <br>I am never going to go back again, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I am going to burn them now.
    <br>Leaving his past behind him, Mr Okashe Wilson takes the occultic charms
    <br>that were used to bring destruction to a secure place
    <br>and proceeds to burn them, in accordance with the Book of Acts 19:19.
    <br>The power of God that located him through prophecy has put his past to death,
    <br>giving birth to his future.
    <br>Now he knows that serving satan is a sure way to bitterness, pain and death,
    <br>whereas serving the Lord is the only way to peace and comfort.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus for saving my life!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I have been delivered!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am free!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Wilson Okashe, from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am the one the man of God prophesied about that there was a witchdoctor in the meeting.
    <br>I quickly knew it was me but I don't really know how I managed to come out.
    <br>I made confession of all I had been doing with the charms and brought them to the church.
    <br>I brought everything out and destroyed those charms
    <br>and start a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>After this prophecy when you came forward,
    <br>what happened when the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you?
    <br>After the prophecy, when I had the opportunity to meet with the man of God for prayer,
    <br>my life changed totally.
    <br>The bad thoughts that normally came into my mind of committing suicide
    <br>and all sorts of bad thinking in my mind, I don't think about all that again.
    <br>Mr Okashe Wilson
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Before, when I held money, I didn't know what I did with the money.
    <br>Maybe if I had 200,000 naira, before three days, the money was gone;
    <br>I don't know how it managed to vanish.
    <br>Now, I can give account of how I have spent my money and it doesn't finish so easily.
    <br>Can you just tell us brother, during the time that you were practising as a witchdoctor,
    <br>what were the kinds of attacks you were facing
    <br>and the challenges you actually have been passing through?
    <br>When I was doing these witchdoctor acts, I passed through hell to the extent that
    <br>I wanted to commit suicide.
    <br>Things got so rough that I was almost declared a wanted person where I stay.
    <br>That was what really led me to The SCOAN.
    <br>In my dreams, I had a series of nightmares.
    <br>People would be pursuing me in my dreams and they would catch me.
    <br>When people were pursuing me, I would hide; I would think that nobody would see me.
    <br>People would just come straight to where I was hiding and fetch me out.
    <br>So what you are saying - despite all the work you were doing in darkness in the past as a witchdoctor,
    <br>you were still facing attack and your whole life was without any peace.
    <br>Yes, there was no peace in my life.
    <br>Sometimes, I didn't even see myself as a human being.
    <br>Sometimes, I would go and sleep among mad people -
    <br>where mad people were sleeping, I would sleep among them.
    <br>It got to a point that another powerful witchdoctor told me that a dead animal was better than me.
    <br>I began to wonder how a dead animal could be better than a living person.
    <br>By the time I began to see what was going on, I began to disappoint people here and there,
    <br>people gave me contracts, I failed.
    <br>As a printer, people gave me jobs, people who wanted to launch their books.
    <br>At the end, they would not be able to launch the books because I would disappoint them.
    <br>I disappointed people here and there.
    <br>I decided to run to The SCOAN for the salvation of my soul so that I would repent for the glory of God.
    <br>We thank God that you came down to The SCOAN,
    <br>received that word of prophecy and after the prophecy received the deliverance
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua actually prayed for you, what happened to your body?
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me, something entered my body
    <br>and I could not even imagine what really happened.
    <br>No man of God has ever prayed for me and I would manifest but
    <br>there was something that happened to me; it was like something left me.
    <br>Since then, my life has changed.
    <br>I have been sleeping and doing well.
    <br>I have peace of mind now.
    <br>Amen. We thank God for the deliverance that our brother has received.
    <br>You mean to say, as you are returning back to your state now,
    <br>you are ready to completely forsake the life you once lived as a witchdoctor,
    <br>and you are now ready to give your life completely to our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Sure, I am ready to work for God right now; I am ready to follow the footsteps of Jesus.
    <br>We thank God for your life, my brother.
    <br>We are here today with a message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The man of God said, as you have now come to the church for salvation of your soul
    <br>with the decision to repent of your past and to forsake the gods you once worshipped
    <br>and destroy all of the charms you once used to really destroy a lot of people,
    <br>he is here today to present to you a gift to help you start a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>we are here to present to you this cash gift of 100,000 naira,
    <br>alongside the Word of God, 'The Mirror', to help our brother start a new life in Christ.
    <br>Once again; this is 100,000 naira for our brother and also 'The Mirror',
    <br>which is the Word of God to always encourage him to stay close to our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>now that he has received his freedom.
    <br>I am short of words; I don't know how to express my joy.
    <br>I don't know how to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I never expected a gift like this.
    <br>I am so amazed; I am so surprised, I don't know what to say.
    <br>I am short of words.
    <br>I pray that God will continue to use this man to change the nations
    <br>and the world will know that he really is a man of God.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>My brother, now that you are going forth to make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>maintain the wonderful deliverance you received,
    <br>what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world,
    <br>especially people that often patronised witchdoctors,
    <br>go to other gods to try and seek solution,
    <br>as someone that was actually a witchdoctor in the past and went through all of this?
    <br>What do you want to advise such people?
    <br>My advice to those people who have similar problems as mine and run from one witchdoctor
    <br>or spiritualist to another is, there is nobody like Jesus Christ.
    <br>They should not run to any witchdoctor for help; rather, they should run to God.
    <br>They should accept Jesus Christ, have a connection with Him
    <br>and I believe since Jesus Christ has made me a new person,
    <br>He will also make them a new person and put an end to every problem they are having.
    <br>Amen. We thank God for your life brother.
    <br>We pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this blessing
    <br>and make a proper use of this wonderful gift you have been given,
    <br>by making the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>We know as you do so, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
