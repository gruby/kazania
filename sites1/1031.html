  <p>    
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the people in Jesus' name,
    <br>the evil spirits lurking in their lives are exposed and they manifest, confessing their destructive activities.
    <br>He is finished!
    <br>What have you done to his career?
    <br>He is finished, he can't do anything again.
    <br>He only likes old women because that's what I want him to do.
    <br>What have you done to his career?
    <br>He has no career anymore.
    <br>With one touch from the hand of God and he is set free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for delivering me!
    <br>I'm free!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Emmanuel Chigozie Madubuike.
    <br>I'm from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>The woman next to me is my lovely mum.
    <br>In 2013, I got the opportunity to travel to South Africa.
    <br>Before I travelled, one of my friends told me that he needed to take me somewhere
    <br>so that I could fortify myself spiritually to be strong.
    <br>This was for me to be wealthier than anyone in my family or my friends.
    <br>I liked the suggestion because I needed money.
    <br>I followed that person to a native doctor.
    <br>On the way, my friend told me that the person was a very strong native doctor and that he knew him.
    <br>I asked him if he had been going there.
    <br>He told me not to worry for he knew him.
    <br>We went there.
    <br>The man asked me my name and I told him and gave him my picture.
    <br>He told me that before anything, I should deposit 50,000 naira and I told him no problem.
    <br>I withdrew and gave him the money.
    <br>I told him that he should convince me that he knew what he was doing as a spiritualist.
    <br>I lost my father in 2011 and he told me that he was in Abuja having fun with some women.
    <br>I was wondering which father he was talking about and looked at my friend.
    <br>He tried to convince me by telling me that I am a great man
    <br>but I needed to hear something more vital and specific about me than that to convince me.
    <br>He did an incantation and after all, he still said the same thing concerning me
    <br>and he told me that as he was talking to me, my dad was in Abuja with a woman in a hotel.
    <br>I was wondering what hotel he was referring to when someone had passed away.
    <br>I didn’t want to tell him anything; I wanted to make a fool of him.
    <br>After that, I called my friend outside and told him that I was no longer interested
    <br>for this man told me that my dad was having fun when my dad had passed away many years ago.
    <br>I entered again and told the man that I wanted to talk to him.
    <br>I told him that I didn’t need him anymore and that I wanted my things – picture and money.
    <br>He said that I couldn’t take anything back.
    <br>I pointed to my money on his plate and he told me that I could not touch the money again.
    <br>I agreed but still asked him if I could take my picture and he gave it to me.
    <br>I thanked him and drove out.
    <br>I told that man that I was no longer interested and I would travel the way I was.
    <br>I knew I would make it.
    <br>The man suggested another man again and said that this very man was very strong.
    <br>If this man didn’t convince me, I should not give any money.
    <br>I made sure that I slept in the same room with that guy so that he would not call the native doctor
    <br>and be telling him about me.
    <br>At a point, I started thinking that they were trying to take my money.
    <br>I told him that we were going on the next day but both of us had to sleep in my house.
    <br>He accepted.
    <br>In the following morning, we went to a shrine.
    <br>Immediately we entered the place, the native doctor looked at me and called me by my name.
    <br>I was shocked.
    <br>He told me the reason why I was there.
    <br>I confirmed.
    <br>I told him that he was the man I was looking for.
    <br>He said to me that before everything, I had to pay 100,000.
    <br>I told him that 100,000 was not a problem and that I would provide.
    <br>I thought paying 100,000 to get millions was OK for me.
    <br>Then, we drove out to withdraw 100,000 and we came back to him.
    <br>There were some things they asked me to buy – goat, chicken – to fortify me.
    <br>I accepted it. I went and bought the things with the money.
    <br>When we came back, I handed everything over to him.
    <br>Then, he asked me to kneel down in front of the shrine and I did.
    <br>He told me to say everything I needed in front of the oracle.
    <br>I knelt down and told the oracle that I needed fame, money and power.
    <br>I needed everything.
    <br>I wanted to be bigger than my friends.
    <br>He told me that it was done.
    <br>He said that he needed to give me one advice, as he knew that I was going to South Africa which I confirmed.
    <br>He said that it was a very rough area where they shoot anyhow.
    <br>I needed to fortify myself against gun.
    <br>That was a good idea.
    <br>I asked if I had to bring more money.
    <br>He said that I should relax for now because it seemed that I was afraid to bring money.
    <br>I told him that I was not afraid but if he did a good job, bringing money was not a problem.
    <br>He started fortifying me.
    <br>He killed a chicken and we all ate it.
    <br>After we finished eating at the shrine, he put one chicken feather inside my boxer.
    <br>Then, he brought a little stone and a red cloth which he tore into two to wrap the stone.
    <br>After that, he brought water for me to swallow the stone.
    <br>Before giving it to me, he used the stone for ritual.
    <br>I swallowed the stone and it entered my stomach.
    <br>I asked him, “What else?”
    <br>Immediately I swallowed it, instantly, I was not with myself;
    <br>it was as if another thing came upon me.
    <br>My body became heavy.
    <br>I told him that he was really doing something for me, he was really strong and that I liked him.
    <br>I told him that I felt strong.
    <br>He said that it was time to test what he had done for me by shooting me as he brought out his gun.
    <br>I told him that he could not shoot me.
    <br>He reminded me that I asked for power and he had fortified me and done everything.
    <br>So, he needed to test it.
    <br>When you take an exam, you need to show what you studied.
    <br>After doing everything for me, they had to test it.
    <br>I asked him what would happen if he didn’t do things well and the bullet entered me
    <br>and I would die without my family knowing where I was.
    <br>I told him that as a spiritual man, I believed the spirit didn’t show him things well.
    <br>I asked him to test it on another thing.
    <br>He agreed but at the end, he still had to test it on me.
    <br>He put the feather and stone in a chicken and he shot the chicken which I paid for the bullets.
    <br>He shot the chicken more than six times but the bullets did not enter.
    <br>He said that I had seen this, it had come to my turn.
    <br>I looked at him and asked why he wanted to pressurise me and whether he wanted to kill me.
    <br>He told me that he had fortified me and he needed to test it on me.
    <br>I told him if he had fortified himself, I would like to test it on him
    <br>but I would not allow him to test it on me as it was impossible.
    <br>He told me that since I was afraid, I had to call my mum before the test, in case I died.
    <br>He challenged me by telling me that I am a man.
    <br>I told him that if he had to test it on me, I didn’t want it anymore.
    <br>I said that since he had fortified me and I had paid, I would say thank you and I needed to go.
    <br>He gave me one chalk and one bangle I needed to put on.
    <br>He told me that when I travelled, every morning, I should do incantation
    <br>and use the chalk to draw anything or write my name
    <br>and speak out what I needed and it would come to pass.
    <br>I agreed and collected those stuffs.
    <br>I went back to my house.
    <br>My flight ticket would be for the following week.
    <br>I realised that I would not be able to carry those things he gave me in my flight.
    <br>I had to come back to him because it looked like drugs as it was white.
    <br>I asked myself, "How am I going to take it on-board?"
    <br>He said that he would pack it inside a soap bar and seal it back.
    <br>He did everything and gave it back to me.
    <br>I went to the airport and I was a little bit afraid if they noticed it
    <br>but after scanning me, they did not see anything.
    <br>I entered my flight. I travelled successfully.
    <br>In my mind, I thought I would bring millions of naira back to Nigeria.
    <br>As I had been fortified and I was already inside the plane, I was enjoying.
    <br>I started singing that I would come back to Nigeria in a bigger way.
    <br>I arrived in South Africa.
    <br>In the morning, I did that incantation because I didn’t want to waste time.
    <br>I needed money immediately.
    <br>Everything I told this man to do for me – I asked him to make me wealthy and strong -
    <br>this man took everything and gave me serious poverty.
    <br>I stayed in South Africa for more than two years but I couldn’t boast of anything.
    <br>The residence permit – I didn’t have papers.
    <br>That really tormented me and even gave me sexual urge.
    <br>I didn’t like young woman.
    <br>In South Africa, I used to go out with old people who are above 50 years - that's my favourite.
    <br>My friends knew me.
    <br>If there were young girls, my friends would tell me, "This is not your 'food'. Your 'food' is old people."
    <br>OK.
    <br>We know you have lots of experiences to share with us.
    <br>We want to take you back briefly so that people would know the reason why
    <br>only Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life, and there is no other way.
    <br>There is no hope from spiritualists or witch doctors.
    <br>You said you went to the second witch doctor and he gave you a stone with a red cloth to swallow.
    <br>Could you tell us exactly what happened to you instantly you swallowed the red cloth with a stone
    <br>and what you started to see in your dreams that manifested in the physical?
    <br>OK.
    <br>Immediately I knelt down, he gave me a red cloth that has a stone in it to swallow with water -
    <br>I felt something heavy entered me - it was as if more than 50 giants entered me.
    <br>Every night, I started seeing myself making love with old people in my dreams.
    <br>I started making love with old people in the dream before I travelled and did it in my real life.
    <br>In the dream, I used to see dogs, lions fighting me.
    <br>Sometimes, I would wound them or they would wound me.
    <br>Immediately I woke up, I would scream in the house.
    <br>Everybody would wake up and ask what was wrong with me but I didn't want to tell them.
    <br>So, instead of the witch doctors, native doctors making you rich and more prosperous,
    <br>it was poverty and nightmares?
    <br>Yes, that was what they gave me but what I went there for was for him to make me rich.
    <br>He collected my money and gave me poverty.
    <br>OK, you said that in the dream you started seeing old women making love to you.
    <br>What normally happened to you in the physical?
    <br>In the dream, I started seeing old women making love with me.
    <br>Immediately they finished making love with me,
    <br>I would find myself automatically wet when I woke up and I would be very weak
    <br>and that day would be a very bad day for me.
    <br>In the morning or afternoon I would be thinking of an old woman
    <br>because I didn’t do things with young women.
    <br>After that, I travelled with it.
    <br>Everything that happened to me in the dream while I was still in Nigeria, I started doing it in South Africa.
    <br>I started sleeping with old women of 50-60 years – that was my favourite in South Africa.
    <br>Everything I put my hand on there was not working.
    <br>After seeing that nothing was working for me in South Africa, I applied for a job.
    <br>They would do interview on phone and after the interview, they would be impressed
    <br>and ask me to come to see me physically.
    <br>Immediately I appeared physically, that job would not be given to me.
    <br>I would not get that job again.
    <br>This happened to me once, twice, thrice – I knew the cause.
    <br>I called my friend that introduced me to that native doctor.
    <br>I asked him to remind me the reason we went to the native doctor because I forgot it.
    <br>He said that we went there for me to be rich and he was expecting me to send him money.
    <br>I told him, “You are very stupid.
    <br>Do you know that right now, I am begging to eat, talkless of sending you money?
    <br>Starting from today, deceive me no more!”
    <br>When I was there, I couldn’t boast of anything.
    <br>It was my mum I would disturb to send me money.
    <br>Almost every month, the money I used to pay my house rent in South Africa was from my mum.
    <br>I was in South Africa frustrated and tired – I didn’t know what to do anymore.
    <br>I prepared my passport and travelled to Israel.
    <br>When I was in Israel, God blessed me – I started working in a hotel as a receptionist.
    <br>I could see that my life was changing.
    <br>I sent my first salary to my mum.
    <br>She was very happy.
    <br>She said that after many years, she just received my money.
    <br>I said, “Mummy, don’t worry. The bigger one is coming”.
    <br>Then, I was not in South Africa anymore where I should sleep with an old woman before I could eat.
    <br>I didn’t tell her about it; I was just nursing it in my mind.
    <br>While I was there, my papers got expired.
    <br>When I tried to renew my papers, they said that my papers were fake.
    <br>I asked them how I could have entered Israel with fake papers and even got a job with it.
    <br>They told me that the papers were fake and they could not renew it.
    <br>They did not want to arrest me because of my lawyer who was a strong woman.
    <br>I knew what was happening to me.
    <br>Immediately they told me that, I remembered what I did in Nigeria.
    <br>I knew that was the same thing that was still following me.
    <br>I decided to come back to Nigeria to clear myself from darkness and fix my papers.
    <br>I came back to Nigeria to renew my papers which they called fake.
    <br>There was no way I could travel back.
    <br>I tried everything to go back but there was no way.
    <br>I called the company I worked for and told them that everything was OK.
    <br>They sent me an invitation letter to come back but there was no way.
    <br>That was what I was going through before I discovered Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was in my house, frustrated, tired and angry with my life; I didn’t know what to do.
    <br>I turned on my TV to watch an action movie but it was not clear.
    <br>I was changing channels before I saw Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying.
    <br>I was sitting down alone.
    <br>I started watching the prophet praying.
    <br>I was thinking in my heart, he would not ask me to pay 100,000 or 50,000.
    <br>Then, I decided to come and see.
    <br>If he would also ask for money, I would run away.
    <br>When I stepped my feet in the arena of liberty, I began seeing a lot of changes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I began seeing a lot of changes.
    <br>When the choir was singing, I could feel goose-bumps.
    <br>I could feel the real presence of God.
    <br>Everything that happened to me all this while, I began to view it.
    <br>I believed everything I needed and where I would get my deliverance was here.
    <br>I was wondering how the prophet could locate me where there were millions of people here.
    <br>It seemed to be impossible.
    <br>I decided to pray.
    <br>I believed as I prayed, my problem would be solved.
    <br>Another voice was telling me that I was wasting my time as I was also praying before.
    <br>The voice asked me how this one would make a difference.
    <br>I began to reason with the voice.
    <br>I went outside and the irritation and anger came upon me again.
    <br>I went outside and bought a bottle of water and came inside again.
    <br>I was tired to stay here.
    <br>Immediately the prophet came in, I rushed back to my seat.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was touching people.
    <br>Behold, he went straight to my line.
    <br>I was among the people he touched.
    <br>What a wonderful God!
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ - put you hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>It is a clear proof that weeping may endure for a night but the joy comes in the morning.
    <br>Indeed, he has suffered a lot, been to several places in search of a solution
    <br>but when it was God's time to manifest His deliverance in his life, it happened just like that.
    <br>Tell us; the moment the man of God laid his hand on you -
    <br>how did you feel inside you that brought about your deliverance?
    <br>Immediately Prophet T.B. Joshua laid his hand on me,
    <br>those 50 giants that entered me in the shrine where they collected my money - everything jumped out of me.
    <br>I was so free and became light.
    <br>I felt something came out of me.
    <br>The time those giants jumped inside me, I could feel it.
    <br>When they jumped out, I could feel it again.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ; put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>You heard it all.
    <br>Right in the shrine he was possessed by 50 giants, and he knew they entered his life.
    <br>He said, that here, in the arena of liberty, when the man of God laid his hand upon him,
    <br>the moment the giants left him, he also knew.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ once again.
    <br>Can you tell us; since you have been delivered, what are the changes you have seen in your life?
    <br>Since I have been delivered, I have no more urge for old women.
    <br>When they chat with me, I will be seriously irritated.
    <br>They know something is wrong because they don’t know that I am a new creation.
    <br>I am very free.
    <br>I don’t want to go back to my old life.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>What word of advice do you have for all who are listening to you?
    <br>The word of advice I have for young people is that you cannot go faster than your shadow.
    <br>Wait upon the Lord.
    <br>I ran faster than my shadow; I ran to get everything immediately
    <br>but I entered where they were destroying me slowly.
    <br>I thought I would be rich.
    <br>To God be the glory.
