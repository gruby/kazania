    <br>Where the power of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>Watch, as people fall under the anointing of the Holy Spirit as they receive just a touch
    <br>from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Here is a man with the problem of difficulty in walking.
    <br>Let's see how he is healed.
    <br>I have difficulty in walking and a stomach problem.
    <br>I don't have strength in my knees.
    <br>I'm asking for a miracle from God.
    <br>I don't have strength in my legs.
    <br>I had an operation and I lost the strength in my legs.
    <br>Prayer Line At The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>He says he has no strength in his legs; he was operated and that is why he cannot walk.
    <br>He has no strength in his legs.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua taps his legs and instantly strength descends upon him.
    <br>He rises up to his feet and for the first time, without the use of the walker,
    <br>he walks freely without feeling any pain.
    <br>What a mighty God we serve!
    <br>There is nothing too hard for God, for with God, all things are possible.
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Crusade in Paraguay with T.B. Joshua
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Alberto Alderete.
    <br>I live in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay.
    <br>I have come to testify of God's work in my life
    <br>during the crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Friday.
    <br>I am a lawyer by profession.
    <br>I had a stomach operation.
    <br>I was very fat. I was operated because of obesity - I weighed 260 kg.
    <br>After the operation, I had a severe infection.
    <br>I had septicaemia for approximately one month.
    <br>I lost my sight, my voice and my mobility.
    <br>I lost the strength in my legs.
    <br>I couldn't walk for five months.
    <br>I could not move, see, relate with others or speak; nobody could understand me.
    <br>The day I entered the stadium, I felt the presence of God.
    <br>Seeing so many sick people in need, I put my hope in God.
    <br>At that moment, I gave glory to God.
    <br>I felt a mighty fire burning in me.
    <br>It was burning in me and that changed everything inside of me.
    <br>I felt that God had healed me and given me strength.
    <br>I began to feel strength in my legs, so I left the walker.
    <br>I saw how people felt the power of God manifesting in prayer through the hand of the prophet.
    <br>Through him, God touched all lives.
    <br>"I CAN CONFIRM GOD EXISTS!" | Skeptic Lawyer Receives INSTANT MIRACLE
    <br>I felt the hand of God giving me another chance.
    <br>I felt life in my legs and started walking.
    <br>I realised that I no longer needed the walker; I could move with ease.
    <br>I was dead but now, I am alive. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>I can confirm through the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua that God exists.
    <br>I thank God for everything.
    <br>"I CAN CONFIRM GOD EXISTS!" | Skeptic Lawyer Receives INSTANT MIRACLE
    <br>He demonstrates what he was unable to do for many years,
    <br>before receiving prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua at the Paraguay crusade.
    <br>He then takes a few steps and thanks God for the mighty miracle in his life.
    <br>Jesus Christ had no sickness of His own; He took away our sickness and healed us completely.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ, is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>"I CAN CONFIRM GOD EXISTS!" | Skeptic Lawyer Receives INSTANT MIRACLE
    <br>I thank You, God for everything!
