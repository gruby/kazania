  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, be in line with us - be in one accord with us.
    <br>All the doors opened to the enemy
    <br>through which fear,
    <br>oppression is entering into your life -
    <br>by the key of David,
    <br>right now begin to shut it up, lock it up!
    <br>Lock it up!
    <br>I lock you up, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to lock it up!
    <br>Fear of affliction, stagnation,
    <br>disappointment, setback -
    <br>viewers all over the world - lock it up!
    <br>By the key of David, lock it up!
    <br>Lock it up, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>The fear of stagnation, failure, setback -
    <br>whatever you might have been fearing - by the key of David, be locked up, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>All powers that have been holding you down
    <br>to where you do not belong -
    <br>there are many places you are that you do not belong.
    <br>Say, "I know where I belong".
    <br>Sometimes you find yourself in a position and you say, "I know where I belong.
    <br>I do not belong here. I know where I belong".
    <br>But you have no choice.
    <br>It is the will of God for us to prosper,
    <br>have good health, be the head and not the tail.
    <br>All powers that have been holding you down
    <br>to where you do not belong -
    <br>right now, begin to break it -
    <br>power of stagnation, failure, career failure,
    <br>affliction, sickness and disease.
    <br>Open your lips!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
