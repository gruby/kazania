    <br>Sometimes in our lives, we encounter the harsh realities of the vicissitudes of life.
    <br>I mean changes in our fortunes, which seem difficult to deal with using human standards.
    <br>This has never been more true than now, during the global virus pandemic,
    <br>where almost every single person on planet earth has been affected in one way or the other.
    <br>Some more than others.
    <br>Emmanuel TV South Africa Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>Good morning, Emmanuel TV viewers.
    <br>We are here in South Africa, in one of the largest retail suppliers
    <br>of bulk goods and essential products.
    <br>We are blessed to bless others.
    <br>Will you come with us now, as we go and get goods?
    <br>Then we will break it into parcels and take it to communities in the the coming days.

    <br>To Give To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>We are here at Makro with the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>We are busy buying all the goods that are needed for the disaster relief,
    <br>sent by Emmanuel TV Partners and Prophet T.B. Joshua.

    <br>was the Orion charity organisation, which houses and supports the physically challenged.

    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>On hearing the Emmanuel TV team had come to visit them with love and gifts,
    <br>they came out in their numbers to greet the team in appreciation for this unexpected love,
    <br>during this critical time.
    <br>Truly, as Prophet T.B. Joshua says, a Christian is known by his love.
    <br>Emmanuel TV South Africa Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>My name is Hanni Cronje and I'm the CEO of the Orion Organisation,
    <br>situated in Atlantis on the west coast of the Western Cape.
    <br>I have been in social work since I graduated,
    <br>and there was a special need for people that are vulnerable,
    <br>and are not able to take care of themselves.
    <br>The virus actually had quite an impact on us at Orion.
    <br>First of all, we couldn't continue with some of our services,
    <br>which are the day-care services, in which are included both children and adults.
    <br>And it is such a pity because they all are involved
    <br>in very specific rehabilitation and development plans,
    <br>which now come to a standstill.
    <br>People that come to Orion on a daily basis to work here; they can't do so.
    <br>The daily meals that they would have received are not given to them.
    <br>They are actually hungry for proper food, which they can't afford.
    <br>Most of these people in our work centre, are part of families,
    <br>of which the only income are the disability grants; they have no other income.
    <br>Thank you so much to Prophet T.B. Joshua in particular
    <br>and to all the Emmanuel TV team, Partners and everybody else
    <br>that came along today to bring joy to this organisation.
    <br>Thank you very much Prophet T.B. Joshua for this enormous gift and donation today.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>Food & Essential Items Purchased By Emmanuel TV
    <br>For The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>My name is Georgie Hallowday.
    <br>The virus has affected us in many ways.
    <br>Thank you very much to Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My name is Dylan Fix.
    <br>I have been living in Orion for four and a half years now.
    <br>Ever since this lockdown started, my parents can't come and visit me.
    <br>Therefore, I'd like to thank Emmanuel TV Partners and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My name is Sambise.
    <br>I've stayed long at Orion.
    <br>Because of the virus lockdown, no one can visit us.
    <br>You can't see your family or anybody.
    <br>You can't go to the shop.
    <br>Thank you, Emmanuel TV!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet Joshua!
    <br>My name is Veronica Pronk.
    <br>I'm the Marketing and Fundraising Manager at Orion Organisation.
    <br>We are based in Atlantis.
    <br>I have been taking care for the past eighteen years.
    <br>My involvement started and I've grown up around people with disabilities,
    <br>as I have a family member with a disability.
    <br>So, the passion to help people with disabilities and being involved in non-profit organisations
    <br>is something I've grown up with and I'm actually living out on a day to day basis.
    <br>The challenges that we are currently facing at Orion are numerous,
    <br>but for me, in my portfolio as Marketing Manager and fundraiser,
    <br>the biggest challenges are financial, as well as the effect it has had on me
    <br>in having fundraising events and hosting events to bring in funding.
    <br>The virus and the lockdown particularly has greatly affected our organisation
    <br>and this is why a donation like this, that Emmanuel TV and the Partners have brought through today
    <br>is so very important to us,
    <br>because this will enable us to help those who are stuck in their communities.
    <br>We have 97 of our beneficiaries currently stuck at home.
    <br>Normally they would have food and provisions here at Orion.
    <br>A huge part of what our problem has been is being solved by this amazing donation today.
    <br>Thank you, Emmanuel TV and Partners and Prophet Joshua.

    <br>After visiting the Orion charity organisation, the team of Emmanuel TV Partners went further
    <br>to visit individual families in isolation, who are also physically challenged.
    <br>Emmanuel TV South Africa Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>The foodstuffs that you delivered to us today mean a lot to us
    <br>because the sickness lockdown is difficult for all of us as we have no income.
    <br>It's difficult because the children cannot go out and they are not used to staying indoors.
    <br>It's difficult because people can't go to work and that is why the foodstuffs mean so much to us.
    <br>I just want to thank Emmanuel TV and Prophet Joshua for the donation.
    <br>The support from Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua means a lot to us
    <br>because the the sickness lockdown is difficult for all of us as we have no income.
    <br>There is no income.
    <br>For everyone that is here to hand over the foodstuff, thank you very much.
    <br>We appreciate it so much as a family - the Malan family;
    <br>thank you very much to all of you!
    <br>Thank you Emmanuel TV Partners and Prophet T.B. Joshua!

    <br>Hi. My name is Elzita Williams and this is my family.
    <br>We are very grateful to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Thank you very much!
    <br>The support of the Emmanuel TV team means a lot to us.
    <br>We have enough food for a month now!
    <br>We are very grateful because we really don't have any support.
    <br>I don't receive any grants for my children.
    <br>I'm very grateful to Emmanuel TV!
    <br>Hi. I'm Sanette Joggem. I'm from West Bank, Cape Town.
    <br>The virus has affected us a lot because there are a lot of needs.
    <br>There is no money or food in the house and you worry about your kids.
    <br>I want to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV
    <br>for supporting us during this lockdown.
    <br>Emmanuel TV South Africa Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>My name is Latitia Moses. I'm a single mother.
    <br>The challenges I've been facing as a single mother because of the lockdown
    <br>are that the grant for the children has run out after the first two weeks and there is no food.
    <br>If it wasn't for food parcels that we have to stand in line to receive, they would have nothing to eat.
    <br>This food means that I can sleep in peace now; I don't have to worry.
    <br>Thank you Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV for your support during this difficult time.

    <br>The team of Emmanuel TV Partners arrive at another destination
    <br>and begin unloading the essential supplies to give to people in need.

    <br>People in the local community came out of their homes and began to queue
    <br>eager to receive the blessing from the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Emmanuel TV South Africa Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Words cannot express the joy that the community feels,
    <br>knowing that God has not forgotten them during this critical time.
    <br>My name is Ebrahim Sawant and I'm essentially a community activist and community leader.
    <br>I'm also a Councillor in the city of Cape Town.
    <br>Today I represent my ward, which is Ward 19, which consists of West Bank and few other suburbs.
    <br>It is more than 50 000 people that I have in my ward; 90 percent of them are poor people.
    <br>Luckily for me, we have people like yourselves that come, in this time of the sickness crisis
    <br>to assist us in feeding our poor people,
    <br>and as we approach winter, our problems are even going to become bigger.
    <br>The support from Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team means a lot to us
    <br>because we can now feed more people.
    <br>We appreciate the association.
    <br>May God bless you so that you can carry on with the good work.
    <br>Thank You Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners - thank you very much.

    <br>I'm the founder of Global Community Foundation situated in West Bank.
    <br>We are living in a poverty area, where people struggle to make a living.

    <br>where people also struggle to survive.
    <br>We are tremendously overwhelmed by the support of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and also the Emmanuel TV crew, that actually assist us in this regard.
    <br>We are blessed and we believe that this will make a great impact in the lives of our people,
    <br>whom we serve in our community.

    <br>My message is also to encourage others to follow the example of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and Emmanuel TV to do more in our community.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners - we appreciate your support.

    <br>The support that I received from Emmanuel TV is so huge.
    <br>I didn't expect such a lot of food.

    <br>I can't go out to get money, to go out to work, to put bread on the table,

    <br>and provide much needed relief to those communities.
    <br>I would also like to take this opportunity to encourage each and every person watching this to give.

    <br>God bless you as you give.
    <br>Looking at the society today, you will agree with me that the church can no longer afford to sit on the fence.

    <br>had the wonderful blessing to be part of the disaster relief efforts
    <br>organised by Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>We thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua and we thank every single partner of Emmanuel TV.
