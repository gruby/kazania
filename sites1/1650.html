    <br>Viewers all over the world, this is the moment.
    <br>He has done it; He can still do it.
    <br>We look differently, we see differently, we think differently.
    <br>At this moment, you have come to the conclusion that yes,
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>It is your time to receive.
    <br>Whatever spirit that has been holding you in bondage -
    <br>right now begin to be released!
    <br>Release!
    <br>Release yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say, "I'm released, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Whatever spirit -
    <br>I'm released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you are connected
    <br>wherever you are all over the world.
    <br>Whatever weaknesses, shortcoming, burden, affliction satan is using to connect you to himself -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are separated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Whatever challenge satan is using,
    <br>whatever situation satan is using to connect you to himself...
    <br>You know what I'm talking about; you know what causes you not to pray.
    <br>You will begin to think, "Where is my God? Where is my Jesus?"
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You say, "Where is my God? Where is my Jesus? Why is this happening to me?"
    <br>I can see you being freed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You can know if you are healed.
    <br>God's Word says we can know.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Let the weak say, "I'm free!"
    <br>Let the sick say, "I'm healed!"
    <br>Let the poor say, "I'm blessed, in the name of Jesus Christ!"
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
