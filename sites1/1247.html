  <p>    
    <br>On December 9, 2018, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a message of prophecy for the nation, Nigeria.
    <br>Let's hear what he said.
    <br>Join me to pray for my nation.
    <br>I have a message for my country, Nigeria.
    <br>If the whole thing is not well, we cannot gather in Nigeria.
    <br>There is a message and you pray.
    <br>Nigeria, we should pray against a stopover
    <br>and pray for a smooth democracy.
    <br>Open your lips and pray.
    <br>Pray against a stopover
    <br>and pray for a smooth democracy.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
