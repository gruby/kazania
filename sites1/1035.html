  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It is time for in-searching for your heart.
    <br>My hands are blessed
    <br>With the blessings of the Lord
    <br>Everything I touch
    <br>Surely must be blessed
    <br>My hands are filled
    <br>With the blessings of the Lord
    <br>Let me find your heart; your appearance can be deceptive.
    <br>You look as if you are laughing whereas you are not laughing.
    <br>You look as if you believe, you do not believe.
    <br>You look as if you are here, you are not here.
    <br>Let me see your heart. Let me find your heart.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>Your heart.
    <br>Let your heart contact the Holy Spirit,
    <br>your heart contact God.
    <br>My heart, speak to the Holy Spirit,
    <br>find the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When your heart is at rest, you are at home.
    <br>You are at home, when your heart is at rest.
    <br>My heart.
    <br>Search your heart.
    <br>Are you still  holding unforgiveness, resentment, anger, bad feelings towards anyone?
    <br>You need a free spirit, a free heart to offer the prayer of faith.
    <br>The prayer of faith will heal the sick.
    <br>The prayer of faith will set the captives free.
    <br>The prayer of faith will bless the poor.
    <br>If there is any sin, you shall be forgiven.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Receive a free heart, a free spirit.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I want to be like Jesus in my heart.
    <br>Tell yourself, "I want to be like Jesus in my heart".
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I believe, I'm talking to a free spirit.
    <br>Say, "My heart is free. There are no bad feelings towards anyone - no resentment,
    <br>no unforgiveness, no anger, in Jesus Christ's name!"
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Salvation has come.
    <br>How will you keep this salvation?
    <br>Because this is home, the temple of the Holy Ghost without unforgiveness,
    <br>resentment, anger, bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let your future speak for you. Be patient for your future".
    <br>Yes, you are to be patient for your future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Patient for your future.
    <br>Right now, you want to cleanse the house.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Let the power of the Lord from Heaven above
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Do not forget that this is not a song, it is a tongue to Heaven.
    <br>You are speaking to Heaven with all your heart - it is a prayer, it is not just a song.
    <br>Wherever demon is hiding in your life, right now, begin to rebuke that demon out of your life.
    <br>Out of my life!
    <br>You demon!

    <br>Strange substances the people are vomiting out, right now.
    <br>Those are the poisonous substances they have taken in the dream and at the table of the enemy.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is flushing them out right now.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Right now, begin to use your faith to put a demand on the anointing.
