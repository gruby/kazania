    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour beside you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel".
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of the Most High God.
    <br>My name is brother Chris and it is a wonderful privilege to share the Word of God with you today.
    <br>I had the privilege to be brought up in a Christian home,
    <br>as I know many of us here today and watching all over the world also were.
    <br>Being brought up in a Christian home, as a young boy,
    <br>I used to read those Old Testament Bible stories.
    <br>We are very familiar with these wonderful, amazing stories from the Old Testament in the Bible.
    <br>You have the story of David and Goliath, Noah and the arc - incredible stories.
    <br>As a young boy reading those stories, they used to animate and illustrate them,
    <br>so you see it pictorially to try and understand what happened.
    <br>They are incredible stories; Jonah in the whale - just name them.
    <br>But there is always one story I used to hear and learn about as a young boy that confused me,
    <br>from the Old Testament.
    <br>Very difficult to comprehend.
    <br>The story I'm referring to is the time the Israelites were released from their captivity in Egypt,
    <br>and they were crossing the desert to the Promised Land.
    <br>Do you remember this story?
    <br>Are you familiar with this story?
    <br>Wonderful.
    <br>If you are not, you can read the Book of Numbers and Exodus to get a clearer idea.
    <br>But specifically, what I'm referring to is in Numbers 13 and 14.
    <br>There is a section of the story that is mind-boggling.
    <br>The Bible says that the Israelites, being led by a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night,
    <br>who saw the awesomeness of God,
    <br>they reached the edge of the Promised Land.
    <br>They were this close to the Promised Land.
    <br>They had been walking through the desert for miles.
    <br>They were inches away from the promise.
    <br>And you know what happened?
    <br>When spies were sent to go and survey the land,
    <br>they came back with a bad report.
    <br>They said, "The people of this land are too huge, too big. We don't stand a chance against them."
    <br>And the people of Israel submitted to panic.
    <br>And at the edge of the Promised Land, they gave up.
    <br>At the edge, in viewing distance of that promise, they lost hope.
    <br>Growing up, I have had the privilege to be part of this ministry,
    <br>where we witness the Bible come alive.
    <br>We see the reality of the Bible.
    <br>Not just a story, history, theology, but the practical essence of Christianity.
    <br>I've realized that the Bible is not just "long-ago events", "ancient wisdom" - no.
    <br>Each subtle, significant, powerful Word in the Scripture is meant for you.
    <br>One Word may speak today, another may speak tomorrow
    <br>but God sent each of them straight to your life.
    <br>I re-read this story in a new light,
    <br>because looking at what is happening around the world,
    <br>what I've personally witnessed to my own small journey thus far,
    <br>I have seen so many people at the edge of the Promised Land give up.
    <br>People at the brink of their breakthrough, on the verge of their victory,
    <br>they give up and lose hope.
    <br>They abandon post because they submit to the pressure of their problem;
    <br>they listen to the voice of their situation instead of the voice of their conscience.
    <br>They submit to panic, fear, worry, anxiety
    <br>and miss out on what God has promised and destined for them.
    <br>They were on the edge of the Promised Land,
    <br>and just like the Israelites of old, they gave up.
    <br>Why am I emphasizing this, brethren today?
    <br>Everyone around the world has a situation, a storm that they are facing.
    <br>I don't know what your situation may be today.
    <br>Many people have changed the history of their lives
    <br>because of inability to see beyond that situation.
    <br>When you don't see beyond your situation, fear sets in.
    <br>"What am I going to do? How am I going to face this?"
    <br>When you don't see beyond your situation, anxiety sets in.
    <br>"How will I get out of this mess?"
    <br>Self-pity sets in.
    <br>"Why me? Why is this always happening to me?"
    <br>Doubt sets in.
    <br>"Where is God in the midst of this?"
    <br>Unbelief sets in.
    <br>"Does God even care? Is He even there?"
    <br>It's a slippery slope, a downward descent.
    <br>Before you know it enough, frame of mind, you apply panic measures.
    <br>You seek shortcuts and adopt alternatives outside of God, become desperate.
    <br>Desperation with his good friend deception begins to wreak havoc in your life.
    <br>Many today have missed out on the Promised Land,
    <br>have changed the history of their lives because of this - they submitted to panic.
    <br>Those of us that are here today - examine yourself.
    <br>Many of us know we are not where we are meant to be;
    <br>we know we are not where we are supposed to be, where we are destined to be.
    <br>Because of this, many of us are operating under a four-foot ceiling,
    <br>whereas we know the sky is the limit.
    <br>So brethren, what is your situation today?
    <br>What is your storm?
    <br>What is your challenge?
    <br>Is it poverty, in spite of your hard work and efforts?
    <br>Is it inability to secure a job, despite good will and your qualifications?
    <br>Is it lateness in marriage or delay in bearing children?
    <br>Is it sickness that refuses to succumb to treatment and medication?
    <br>What is your own situation?
    <br>I have a very simple message for you today.
    <br>A true believer in Jesus Christ must have the determination
    <br>not to listen to the panic of the moment but to find the quiet voice of counsel.
    <br>In other words, to pause and listen to what the Holy Spirit is saying concerning your situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>in the face of your trouble, refuse to panic and learn to pause".
    <br>Tell your other neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>in the face of your storm, refuse to panic and learn to pause".
    <br>We should be still even in the midst of the storm -
    <br>not submit to panic - and begin to do the right thing.
    <br>This will lead us to the title of today's message:
    <br>BE STILL EVEN IN THE STORM
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>be still even in the storm".
    <br>Now, turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of Mark 4,
    <br>I'm going to read from verse 35.
    <br>The Book of Mark 4:34
    <br>It reads thus:
    <br>"That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, 'Let us go over to the other side.'
    <br>Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat.
    <br>There were also other boats with him.
    <br>A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped."
    <br>I'm going to pause in between these Scriptures and emphasize some truths to you.
    <br>First of all, I want you to take notice of this:
    <br>The presence of Jesus does not mean the absence of storms.
    <br>Jesus was with them, in the boat!
    <br>He was with them, and the storm came up and struck their boat.
    <br>The promise of God is not "I will keep you away from trouble."
    <br>The promise of God is "I will be with you in trouble and see you through."
    <br>That's the promise of God.
    <br>Trouble does not require any invitation before it comes.
    <br>In fact, the lives of believers in both the Old and New Testaments
    <br>testify that being faithful to God does not eliminate adversity or adversaries.
    <br>Rather, we must recognize that it may be a sign of being faithful to God.
    <br>Storms will come but Jesus is with you through those storms.
    <br>Let's continue reading.
    <br>Mark 4:38 says this:
    <br>"Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion."
    <br>Say, "Wow!"
    <br>I can't hear you; say, "Wow!"
    <br>I want you to imagine that scenario.
    <br>We just read earlier what happened;
    <br>the furious storm came up, the waves broke over the boat
    <br>so that it was nearly swamped
    <br>and in this scenario Jesus was asleep on the boat.
    <br>Why am I emphasizing this?
    <br>I want everyone to be clear.
    <br>Jesus Christ was calm in the storm before He calmed the storm.
    <br>When everyone around Him was restless, Jesus was at rest.
    <br>Though there was trouble surrounding Him, Jesus' heart was not troubled.
    <br>What does this mean to you and me?
    <br>The storm may rage around you but don't let it rage within you.
    <br>Even though trouble surrounds you, don't let your heart be troubled.
    <br>Even when everything around you is unsteady, stay steady as a child of God.
    <br>Let's continue on, as we take this Scripture and apply it to our personal lives.
    <br>"Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion.
    <br>The disciples woke him and said to him, 'Teacher, don't you care if we drown?' "
    <br>Perhaps you can identify.
    <br>Perhaps you can relate.
    <br>Many of us here have been praying, fasting for so long
    <br>without seemingly receiving the reward of our prayers,
    <br>without seeing the corresponding reward of our efforts.
    <br>And in such situations it is easy for you to look and think,
    <br>"Perhaps Jesus is sleeping. Perhaps He is not listening.
    <br>Perhaps He is not taking care. He is not aware."
    <br>Just like the disciples; they said, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"
    <br>"God, don't You care if my marriage fails?
    <br>God, Jesus, don't You care that I'm sick and suffering?
    <br>God, don't You care that I've been maltreated and misjudged at my workplace?"
    <br>In such moments it is easy to have such reflections, such thoughts,
    <br>just as the disciples did - they panicked.
    <br>But there are three lessons I want you to learn here.
    <br>Please, take time to write these down; they will help you in your daily walk of faith.
    <br>Three simple secrets to staying calm in the storm, from this passage of Scripture:
    <br>Number one: Don't misinterpret God's silence as rejection.
    <br>I will repeat once again.
    <br>Don't misinterpret God's silence as rejection.
    <br>There is more to life than meets the ordinary eye.
    <br>The situation you are in today may look ordinary but they have extraordinary effects in the Spirit,
    <br>much of which is hidden to the ordinary eye.
    <br>God knows best.
    <br>Why can't we trust in the plan of the Master Planner?
    <br>Why can't we trust the design of the Divine Designer?
    <br>He knows best.
    <br>If you are passing through a situation as a Christian, it serves a purpose.
    <br>God may not seem to respond to your prayers
    <br>because He is taking time to consider your request.
    <br>Perhaps it is to prepare you for the challenges ahead, to strengthen your desire for Christ,
    <br>to reform you for a better position in God or to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>God knows best.
    <br>That's number one: don't misinterpret God's silence as rejection.
    <br>Number two:
    <br>Don't introduce sentiment into what has been prearranged.
    <br>I will say it one more time:
    <br>Don't introduce sentiment into what has been prearranged.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>As a Christian, every step of your journey - God is aware.
    <br>If you serve Him in truth and faith, whatever comes your way -
    <br>whether blessings or trials, storms or good times - it is as it should be by divine will.
    <br>He is aware.
    <br>No amount of human sympathy or sentiment can change the course of God.
    <br>If it is written that you must face this storm, you must pass through this trial,
    <br>it is written; you must face it.
    <br>You may think, "If I take a shortcut to dodge it, I will quickly overcome."
    <br>All you are doing is postponing the evil day.
    <br>You will still go back to face what you tried to escape.
    <br>If it is written that you must face this,
    <br>don't introduce sentiment into what has been prearranged from above.
    <br>Number three:
    <br>Don't act or react under tension and pressure.
    <br>Once again, three simple secrets to staying calm in the storm:
    <br>Don't act or react under tension and pressure.
    <br>A Christian should not act under tension and pressure.
    <br>In the midst of our challenges that we encounter daily,
    <br>we must find enough calm to think clearly and react diligently.
    <br>Don't respond in the heat of the moment.
    <br>Remember, it is not your challenges or your storms that make you to fall;
    <br>it is your response to them, it is your reaction to them.
    <br>While some of us yield to that tension and pressure and make wrong decisions,
    <br>other face the same tension and pressure and still make the right decisions.
    <br>So it is not what you face but it is how you face it that really matters.
    <br>Don't act or react under tension and pressure.
    <br>In the face of your trouble, refuse to panic and learn to pause.
    <br>In the face of your storm, refuse to panic and learn to pause
    <br>and listen to what the Holy Spirit has to say concerning your situation.
    <br>Let me jump on, in that Book of Mark 4:39.
    <br>"He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, 'Quiet! Be still!'
    <br>Then the wind died down and it was completely calm."
    <br>Some of you may read this and say, "Well, why doesn't it happen in my situation?
    <br>Why doesn't Jesus just come and calm the storm in my marriage,
    <br>or speak stillness to the storm in my business,
    <br>or calm that storm in my finances?"
    <br>In this case Jesus immediately said, "Be still!" and the storm was calmed.
    <br>But I want to re-emphasize:
    <br>Jesus was calm in the storm before He calmed the storm.
    <br>His heart was at peace whilst others were panicking.
    <br>Though trouble surrounded Him, His heart was untroubled.
    <br>And at God's appointed time - in this case, when Jesus said, "Be still!" - the storm was stilled.
    <br>In your own case, we are not here to instruct the Instructor.
    <br>We are not here to command the Commander.
    <br>We are not here to control the Controller.
    <br>We simply submit to His will.
    <br>At God's appointed time your storm will be calmed without any personal effort.
    <br>At God's appointed time your trouble will be removed without any tension and pressure.
    <br>At God's appointed time your problem will be resolved without any personal effort.
    <br>Our own part is to ensure that we are aligned with Him.
    <br>Don't panic.
    <br>Refuse to panic and listen to the voice of your situation.
    <br>Don't allow your emotions to overwhelm your reasoning.
    <br>Don't listen to the temptation to act out of character
    <br>and react badly to the emotional weight you may be experiencing.
    <br>At God's appointed time it will be removed.
    <br>We end this Scripture - verse Mark 4:40 says this:
    <br>"He said to his disciples, 'Why are you so afraid?'"
    <br>Why did you panic?
    <br>Why did you grumble?
    <br>Why did you murmur?
    <br>Why did you lament?
    <br>"Do you still have no faith?"
    <br>Genuine faith can find encouragement even in that which seems discouraging.
    <br>As a Christian, your storm is not like others'.
    <br>What worsens others sharpens you.
    <br>What impairs others improves you as a Christian.
    <br>What mars others makes you stronger as a Christian.
    <br>So brethren, as I bring this message to a conclusion,
    <br>I want to be clear that
    <br>as you look at the great generals of faith in the Bible,
    <br>you can see how many troubles, trials and situations they endured
    <br>to come to a new level in life.
    <br>But none of them submitted to the panic of their situation; they paused and involved God.
    <br>In our own generation today, we are privileged to see someone like Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>as a wonderful example of this.
    <br>I have witnessed Prophet T.B. Joshua in the midst of a lot of storming weather,
    <br>but I have witnessed him weather every storm.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because the vicissitudes and calamities of this world cannot dictate the direction of a man of faith
    <br>whose focus is on God.
    <br>The source of our courage does not lie in human sympathy
    <br>or human benevolence or human empathy.
    <br>The source of our courage lies in Jesus Christ.
    <br>As true members of the household of faith, even when everything around us is unquiet,
    <br>we remain calm and determined because our strength, our courage,
    <br>our inspiration is derived from God Almighty.
    <br>So brethren, viewers all over the world:
    <br>What is your situation today?
    <br>I want to assure you as a Christian: What you are passing through will soon become a memory.
    <br>It will soon be history.
    <br>It will soon be part of your testimony because your future is being fashioned at this time.
    <br>When your trouble, your battle is getting hotter, this shows that your breakthrough is getting closer.
    <br>Don't give up at the brink of the Promised Land.
    <br>I pray this message will strengthen you to face your challenges and storms
    <br>with confidence and joy
    <br>and may you see your Promised Land, in Jesus' name.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts.
