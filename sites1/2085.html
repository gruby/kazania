  <p>    
    <br>My name is Kedibonye Lesego. Man of God, help me!
    <br>I'm from Botswana.
    <br>My problem is chronic constipation; I have to use a water enema to able to go.
    <br>I've had chronic constipation for twenty-two years.
    <br>To go, I have to pour warm water into this device
    <br>and I have to lie on the floor and put it up my bum to flush out my colon.
    <br>This is how I live my life.
    <br>I cannot go naturally by myself.
    <br>It has affected me all my life because I'm chronically tired.
    <br>For twenty-two years I have had chronic constipation; I've tried all sorts of things.
    <br>I take laxatives.
    <br>I've been to doctors; I've been to consultants.
    <br>All they say is that it's a slow bowel movement.
    <br>I want to be able to go naturally, as God created me.
    <br>Man of God, help me!

    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>Who are you? Speak out!
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Chronic constipation".
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am free!
    <br>My family are free. Thank You, Jesus. I am free.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Kedibonye Lesego. I am originally from Botswana, but I live in the UK now.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was chronic constipation that I had for twenty-two years,
    <br>and also the problem of setbacks and so forth.
    <br>This problem of chronic constipation was not a good thing to live with.
    <br>I was not able to go naturally by myself to the toilet.
    <br>I had to depend on things like laxatives which I bought from the chemists,
    <br>or the water enema system that I demonstrated on the video.
    <br>Though they gave me some form of relief, they were not a permanent solution,
    <br>and they were not really comfortable for me to use.
    <br>With the water enema system, when you put the water up your bowels
    <br>you can feel the water going in and you start having some pains and cramps.
    <br>It's really not comfortable.
    <br>But I had to do that because I had no other way - I couldn't naturally go to the toilet by myself.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN because I was tired of having to use all these things, and not being able to go naturally.
    <br>I am a pharmacist by profession, and I knew that I had to do something.
    <br>So, I came here on advice from other people.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet TB Joshua, prayed for me
    <br>and instantly I felt so light, and I felt relief.
    <br>I felt like a hammer hit me on the head, but it was very light.
    <br>I knew that I was healed, because I started feeling some movements on my stomach -
    <br>something that I haven't felt before.
    <br>And somehow I knew that the power of God was at work.
    <br>I then started going naturally by myself, which was amazing.
    <br>While it was happening, I thought, "Wow! Could I be going by myself now?".
    <br>But sometimes you have to be careful of the thoughts that you have.
    <br>But anyway, I can go naturally by myself now without having to use anything.
    <br>I now have the urge, just like I used to before I had this chronic constipation.
    <br>The constipation is a thing of the past now. I feel brand new.
    <br>So, now you are free?
    <br>I am free!
    <br>You can go to the toilet naturally by yourself?
    <br>I can go to the toilet naturally by myself now, yes.
    <br>There is no need to make use of the water irrigation process anymore?
    <br>No, I just have it here. But after this I am going to throw it away. I don't have to use this anymore.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?

    <br>I have another testimony.
    <br>Just over three years ago in 2016, I was watching Emmanuel TV on my mobile phone -
    <br>not even on the television, but on my mobile phone.
    <br>Prior to that, I drank alcohol socially.
    <br>I wasn't addicted to alcohol, but I drank alcohol.
    <br>And being a Christian, each time I read the Bible I felt convicted about drinking alcohol.
    <br>So, it was something that I had been asking God to help me with.
    <br>But, one day I was watching Emmanuel TV on my phone after I had just woken up.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet TB Joshua, was giving a teaching on believing and faith in Jesus -
    <br>that Jesus Christ was the Healer.
    <br>While I was watching this teaching, a thought came to me,
    <br>"This is all fake. Jesus Christ cannot heal. This is all fake".
    <br>As soon as I had that thought - because I thought it was me, because I was the one thinking that thought -
    <br>somehow I rebuked the thought and I said, "Get away from me, satan! It is Jesus Christ doing the work!".
    <br>As soon as I said this out loud, this mighty power came over me and pinned me to my bed.
    <br>I couldn't get up and then I started screaming and yelling.
    <br>I couldn't control it.
    <br>Even though I was conscious of what was happening, I couldn't control it.
    <br>It was as though some power had pinned me to my bed.
    <br>This went on for about three times of alternating between screaming and then laughing.
    <br>I didn't really understand what was happening that morning, about three years ago.
    <br>Later on during the day, I felt so light.
    <br>Later on Saturday night, I wanted to get some alcohol out of the fridge to drink, like I usually do.
    <br>As soon as I opened the fridge, a thought came to me,
    <br>"I've actually been delivered from drinking alcohol and I don't want to drink this alcohol anymore".
    <br>The urge to drink alcohol had left me, and I threw away the bottles of wine that were in my fridge.
    <br>To this day I have not touched alcohol.
    <br>I don't have the urge to drink.
    <br>It feels like I have never drank alcohol in my life.
    <br>When TB Joshua PRAYED, It Felt Like A HAMMER On My Head!!!
    <br>My word of advice: Jesus Christ is real. He is the Healer.
    <br>Whatever the Bible says is true.
    <br>We may have thoughts that we even think it is us having them, like thoughts of unbelief and so on.
    <br>But Jesus Christ is the same; He never changes.
    <br>We will change, but Jesus Christ never changes. He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>And He is the Healer. He healed me and I feel like those things are past memories for me now.
    <br>Amen. Thank you. Let's clap for Jesus once again.
    <br>We thank you so much and we rejoice with you concerning what God has done in your life,
    <br>having received healing and deliverance.
    <br>We also encourage you to go back home and make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>As you do so, always have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
