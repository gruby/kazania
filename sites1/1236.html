    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Greet the viewers, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, you are in the presence of God!"
    <br>Today is the day that the Lord has made.
    <br>I will rejoice and be glad in it, in Jesus‘ name.
    <br>Have your seat. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>This message today will be given in two languages: in English and French, as instructed by the Prophet.
    <br>God has made wonderful promises and they are for you, personally.
    <br>But unfortunately today, many find it difficult to believe
    <br>that God’s promise can be fulfilled in their lives.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have a challenge today.
    <br>We are too conditioned to believe
    <br>that what we read in the Bible is for the people in the Bible alone, not for us today.
    <br>We are too conditioned to believe
    <br>that what God says can happen to others, will not happen to us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not by power; it is not by might.
    <br>It is according to the grace of God.
    <br>By grace, Jesus met Levi, a tax collector and made him Apostle Matthew.
    <br>By grace, Jesus met a murderer sentenced to death at the cross and gave him eternal life.
    <br>By grace, Jesus met Saul, a state prosecutor and made him the great Apostle Paul.
    <br>By grace, God chose Prophet T.B. Joshua and made him a prophet to the nations,
    <br>a mentor to millions, a channel of shining light giving illumination to the whole world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Today, by the grace of God, Jesus will change your life, if you believe.
    <br>If you believe today, the Lord will change your life in the same way, in Jesus‘ name!
    <br>God always asks us to do what we cannot do ourselves so that He can teach us how to do it.
    <br>When you allow God to transform you by the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>then He will literally begin to show you the way.
    <br>Then, you can know what God wants you to do and how He wants you to do it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you believe, that transforming power will change your life today.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Let someone say, 'The transforming power'.
    <br>This is our message today: 'The transforming power'.
    <br>Let’s open our Bible to the book of Genesis 1:1.
    <br>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
    <br>The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep.
    <br>And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
    <br>Then God said, 'Let there be light‘; and there was light.
    <br>And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
    <br>God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.
    <br>So the evening and the morning were the first day.“
    <br>Good Morning to you all!
    <br>Good Morning to my life!
    <br>Good Morning to my career!
    <br>Good Morning to my destiny!
    <br>Is your life unformed and void?
    <br>Follow Jesus. Jesus is the Repairer and the Restorer.
    <br>He came to earth to transform our lives from darkness to light
    <br>and to make us partakers of the divine inheritance of the saints.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In 1 Samuel 9:21, Prophet Samuel came to anoint Saul,
    <br>and Saul answered, 'Am I not from the land of Benjamin, the least tribe of Israel?‘
    <br>When God sent the angel to Gideon to establish him as a judge of Israel,
    <br>Gideon said, 'My family is the poorest in Mannaseh‘.
    <br>He focused on his weakness; he focused on his poor family background.
    <br>When God called Moses to lead His people into the Promised Land,
    <br>Moses said, 'Lord, I cannot speak‘.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to tell you just one story.
    <br>One day, the Prophet preached one message and said,
    <br>"There was one disciple that was too quiet. He didn’t want to talk“.
    <br>That disciple is me; I’m the one.
    <br>I could not talk when I came here. I was too afraid to talk.
    <br>This lasted for long.
    <br>When I saw the Prophet preach, I would say, "Wow.
    <br>I will never be able to face the crowd and speak. It is too much for me“.
    <br>But glory be to God, I’m serving a man of vision.
    <br>He called me and spoke to me one day.
    <br>In class, when the Prophet said, „Who has a message?“, everybody raised their hand.
    <br>I raised my hand.
    <br>When he looked towards me, I took my hand down.
    <br>But he had seen me already.
    <br>He told me, „Ok, you are going to preach tomorrow“.
    <br>I said, „Heh? Im going to preach in the church?“
    <br>My heart started pounding.
    <br>I could not sleep the whole day.
    <br>Night closed in. I said, "Maybe Prophet just said it to test my faith".
    <br>When the time came, someone said, "Dress up. Prophet is calling you“.
    <br>I went and he said, "Are you ready? Ok, go and preach the message“.
    <br>The time I left, my heart…
    <br>I was saying, "Lord, how will I start? How will I do it?“
    <br>But the moment they gave me the mic, grace entered me.
    <br>Where God guides, He provides.
    <br>Where God guides, He provides and protects.
    <br>God Almighty oftentimes uses His messengers, servants
    <br>among those who have the least advantage of natural talent.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How strange but wholly true, the weak, full of power the Father’s work will do.
    <br>This explains why a young, rustic and seemingly inexperienced David
    <br>could be able to defeat Goliath in representative combat.
    <br>This explains why Moses, the son of a Hebrew slave, was able to stand before Pharaoh
    <br>and proclaim the oracle of God.
    <br>This explains why people without mighty strength, fast legs, smoothness of tongue
    <br>should ever remain faithful to God for the purpose God has designed and called them for.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not by power, not by might but by His grace.
    <br>Lord, I know You can change me.
    <br>Lord, I am here for the radical transformation of my life.
    <br>I know You can do it for me.
    <br>If you believe, He will do it for you today, in Jesus‘ name.
    <br>Those whom God calls for any service, He makes them fit for it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the reason why God sent His Son, Jesus, to you and me.
    <br>Jesus Christ can change anyone – anywhere, anytime.
    <br>In John 15:3, Jesus said, 'You are already pure because of the Word I have spoken to you‘.
    <br>This means, Jesus has come to brush aside our unworthy past
    <br>and to bring us to the presence of the living Father without any sense of unworthiness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus can change anyone – anywhere, anytime.
    <br>Jesus is looking for someone to change today. Are you the one?
    <br>Begin to rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you believe what God said to Gideon and Saul can happen to you?
    <br>If you are too conditioned to believe that what God said cannot happen to you,
    <br>let me encourage your faith.
    <br>Success, greatness is not about our weaknesses, faults, pitfalls.
    <br>It is all about what Jesus has done for you at the Cross of Calvary.
    <br>He has made you fit and qualified you for God’s purpose in your life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You don’t need to be perfect to be used by God. You just need to be available.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you available to Him? Are you available? Follow Jesus.
    <br>If you follow Him, your life will never be the same.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Remember what he said to the disciples in Luke 10:20:
    <br>Do not rejoice that demons are subject to you but rejoice that your names are written in Heaven‘.
    <br>Knowing God is not only to see His miracles but to learn His ways.
    <br>When we learn the way of God,
    <br>then we should follow the path of faith and humility that leads to safety and eternal life.
    <br>Jesus‘ disciples followed the divine process of God.
    <br>They knew there is a time to march with God and a time to march for God.
    <br>They followed the divine principles and they met the requirement of deeper commitment to God.
    <br>And the Spirit of the Father came upon them
    <br>and made them pearls of usefulness for generations yet unborn.
    <br>They are our mirrors today.
    <br>If you want to be God’s person, follow His process.
    <br>If you want to be the man God created, follow His process.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus Christ is concerned about you.
    <br>Jesus is concerned about me; Jesus is concerned about you.
    <br>God Almighty is much more interested about our future than our present state.
    <br>He knows that success has many dangers of its own.
    <br>He knows that when we come to the top, our spiritual life may gradually deterioriate.
    <br>That is why God Almighty is busy building character now
    <br>so that when you reach the place of your divine assignment,
    <br>you may not crack, explode and lose it all.
    <br>Our conduct, our character must change to agree with God’s plan for our lives.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Dedication and discipline are the fruit of victory.
    <br>Physical growth is the function of time;
    <br>intellectual growth is the function of learning
    <br>but spiritual growth is the function of obedience to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, today is your day.
    <br>Today, we believe that the transforming power of God will make your impossibilities possible.
    <br>The Gospel of God’s grace challenges and changes everything.
    <br>To His transforming power, nothing is impossible.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is God’s power working through His Word by His Spirit
    <br>that brings about a new birth and a radical transformation of our lives.
    <br>How do we know the power of God?
    <br>To know God’s presence is to know His power.
    <br>How do we know the presence of God then?
    <br>The Word of God is the living presence of the divine power.
    <br>The Spirit of God will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of the Word of God.
    <br>God is with us in the living Word.
    <br>How do we know God?
    <br>We know God by the Word He speaks
    <br>and the Word God speaks represents His heart’s desire for me and for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Word has priority over His name.
    <br>When you take God’s Word to heart by meditation and truly make it a part of you,
    <br>it will, by its very nature, change you.
    <br>Christ’s eternal Word enables us to stop reliving the past in our present lives.
    <br>Christ’s eternal Word enables me to stop reliving the past in my present life.
    <br>When you receive the living Word in the midst of your heart,
    <br>the past will no longer control your thinking pattern, will never control your behaviour.
    <br>When you receive the living Word of Christ in the midst of your heart,
    <br>the past will no longer control your thinking pattern or your behaviour.
    <br>Then, you will begin to think not of your weakness, not of yourself
    <br>but of your righteousness in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Today, my impossibilities will become possible.
    <br>Today, I believe my life will never be the same again.
    <br>Believe the Word of God.
    <br>Trust in the Word of God and your life will never be the same.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
