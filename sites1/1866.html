    <br>WATCH SWOLLEN BODY BURST DURING PRAYER!!!
    <br>This is Master Paul Akhanemhe, a 15 year old from Edo State, Nigeria,
    <br>who has come to The SCOAN with the terrible infirmity of severe swelling across his entire body.
    <br>From his face to his feet Paul is bloated, swollen and in severe pains.
    <br>You can see the size of his stomach and can only imagine the excruciating agony he must be facing.
    <br>His condition has rendered him unable to join his colleagues in school.
    <br>He needs divine intervention.
    <br>We can see the calves of his legs and ankles are also swollen,
    <br>crippling this young man from being able to move and live freely.
    <br>Master Paul Akhanemhe has come to The SCOAN believing Jesus Christ for a miracle.
    <br>Lord I believe
    <br>My name is Paul Akhanemhe.
    <br>My age is 15 years.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is swollen body.
    <br>I believe that God will heal me.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>At The SCOAN prayer line, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Master Paul Akhanemhe,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the Master Healer.
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus Christ cannot heal.
    <br>Watch as the Holy Spirit is at work, putting an end to this young man's suffering.
    <br>As an instant sign of the divine healing taking place,
    <br>immediately after the prayer Paul begins to urinate,
    <br>as the poisonous substances causing swelling in his body are being forced to come out.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Some time later, Master Paul returns to The SCOAN
    <br>and the transformation in his life and health is truly remarkable.
    <br>The swelling throughout his entire body has disappeared.
    <br>See how his stomach is now flat.
    <br>Looking healthy and strong, leaving no trace that his body was ever swollen,
    <br>Master Akhanemhe is now free to live an active and healthy life.
    <br>When Jesus Christ heals, He heals completely, He heals effectually.
    <br>Before | After
    <br>I am not telling you what I feel
    <br>about Jesus of Nazareth
    <br>I am telling you what I know
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>WATCH SWOLLEN BODY BURST DURING PRAYER!!!
    <br>Paul testified during The SCOAN Sunday Service about his divine healing.
    <br>Let's hear from him and rejoice with him.
    <br>My name is Paul Akhanemhe, I'm from Edo State.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN today to share my testimony of the good work God has done for me.
    <br>Before I came here, I was not able to go to school and I've been to so many hospitals
    <br>and there was no remedy, so I came to The SCOAN and the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>I passed out urine and I was free.
    <br>Before, if I touched my belly, it was painful but now,
    <br>I can touch my belly and I am not feeling any pain.
    <br>I thank God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>We also join you to say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the miracle working Jesus?
    <br>Who is like my Jesus
    <br>Who is like my Lord
    <br>He is the Alpha Omega
    <br>Beginning and the End
    <br>Redeemer Mediator Comforter Messiah
    <br>Everlasting King of all
    <br>No one is like You
    <br>Who is like my Jesus
    <br>In this world
