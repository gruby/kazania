  <p>    
    <br>My name is Hugh Mtshali. I am from South Africa.
    <br>I am the CEO and a businessman and by profession I am an analitical chemist.
    <br>And next to me is my business partner.
    <br>One of my businesses is in the manufacturing of healthcare products.
    <br>It's one of the most important products in South Africa, where we supply the government of South Africa.
    <br>The business has been around for more than twenty years.
    <br>At some stage, about ten years ago we started experiencing some issues in the business.
    <br>The business had financial challenges, we then had some attacks.
    <br>Through those attacks, we thought: "What is going wrong?"
    <br>We called upon other third party agencies to come over and test our product to see if anything was wrong.
    <br>or if there was anything we could improve.
    <br>But then we found out that there was nothing wrong with our product.
    <br>I tried to speak to some influential people to see what kind of intervention they could bring
    <br>in this whole challenge that we were facing.
    <br>Our business appointed more than two hundred people
    <br>and most of them were black women, unemployed people.
    <br>So we thought: "Let's take them from poverty and unemployment and give decent jobs."
    <br>But then, when we started getting those challenges because we weren't able to sell the product
    <br>because it could not be approved, to be tested.
    <br>We went to get some funding debt from a bank in South Africa.
    <br>And then, at some stage, this attack led us to the fact that we couldn't service the debt.
    <br>So then we started getting into problems and it just went on and on.
    <br>And it really affected me, big time.
    <br>At some stage, we were coming from a place in Pumalanga
    <br>and I found out that my blood pressure was very high.
    <br>So that was the stress that the business had on me, personally.
    <br>So I was hospitalized for about a week and my BP was at about 220, that could cause a stroke.
    <br>After we received help from the bank, we were unable to service the debt.
    <br>We tried everything. We tried everything humanly possible.
    <br>My colleague kept on telling me about Emmanuel TV: "Try Emmanuel TV, pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua."
    <br>And then I said: "Ok, I will give it a try at some time."
    <br>And then the bank sent us these papers, letters of demand,
    <br>meaning that they wanted their money, otherwise we were going to get into trouble.
    <br>It stressed my wife, Naomi, big time.
    <br>And then we were about to undertake this trip to New York where my daughter was studying.
    <br>At some stage she wanted to cancel the trip saying,
    <br>"How are we going to travel whilst we are in pain".
    <br>She was like, "We don't want our houses, our properties to be repossessed".
    <br>So I said, "Ok, we'll make a plan".
    <br>Then I took up the advice from my business partner
    <br>and said: "We'll just pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua, when he prompts you to touch the screen."
    <br>So what I did was that I took those papers from the bank and as he was prompting us to pray along,
    <br>I took those papers and put them onto the screen.
    <br>And the debt was millions and millions of Rand, big millions.
    <br>So I put those papers on the screen.
    <br>The papers from the bank?
    <br>From the bank. Those are letters of demand and this was no game.
    <br>I put them along and I prayed along.
    <br>As I put my papers on the screen, I felt some energy.
    <br>You felt...?
    <br>Energy. I will put it in the human language: "Zzz!" Alright?
    <br>So that was obviously the power of God. It happened, I put the papers away.
    <br>My wife kept on saying, "Why are we going?"
    <br>We left and I would say to her, "You know, things will be alright. Don't be afraid".
    <br>And nine days later, while we were overseas, I saw this email letter from the bank.
    <br>I read it once, twice, thrice.
    <br>It kept on saying the same thing, "The debt has been cancelled".
    <br>I said: "No, it can't be."
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>After that, because I wouldn't show my wife something I wasn't sure about
    <br>because then I would get a smack.
    <br>I then was strong enough in my resolve to show it to my wife.
    <br>I didn't even want to talk or say anything.
    <br>I just showed her the letter. She read it. She cried.
    <br>She said, "Is it real?" I said, "Well, that's what it says".
    <br>So she read it again. I then thought: "Ok, let me phone our business partners back in South Africa
    <br>to say, "Are we on the same page?  Are you reading what I'm reading?""
    <br>Then they said, "Hugh, we've been looking for you because of this".
    <br>Basically, what that letter said was: "The debt has been cancelled.
    <br>You have one day to sign to agree, whether you want your debt to be cancelled or not."
    <br>Number one. Number two, it said: "You have been selected to qualify for a certain program."
    <br>Which I never applied for.
    <br>So...
    <br>Mr. Hugh Mtshali & Business Partner
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>So, I was hit with two miracles at the same time.
    <br>Of course, I signed it off immediately and I sent it back to South Africa.
    <br>We checked if that letter was authentic and yes, it was authentic.
    <br>We spoke to the bank, the bank said, "We've been waiting for your signature".
    <br>So I thought it was highly imperative for me -
    <br>this is my first time here at The SCOAN to share this wonderful testimony.
    <br>I wouldn't have hidden it because you don't hide things from God. It would be a travesty.
    <br>I won those blessings from God.  So, I tested Him and He intervened at the right time.
    <br>So, it shows that God's timing was perfect because during that trip it was traumatic.
    <br>I kept a brave face to my wife to say, "It's going to be fine", although, I felt worried.
    <br>But I had that belief to give God a chance.
    <br>So the debt is zero. I'm here to give this testimony to the wonderful people.
    <br>Mr. Hugh Mtshali & Business Partner
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>Give God a chance at all times. Trust in Him.
    <br>He is the biggest intervention, strategy, plan - whatever you may call it.
    <br>Whether you are a CEO, a chairman, whether you are experienced in business for hundred years,
    <br>whatever you are - trust in the living God, give Him a chance and He will come through for you.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.
    <br>Yes, indeed, it is obvious that after our brother had exhausted all his emotional and mental resources,
    <br>he definitely had to trust in Someone who is smarter, stronger and wiser which is our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>And today we can see the evidence of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ who had indeed transformed
    <br>not only your life and your business at large.
    <br>We thank God for your life and we just want to tell you
    <br>that now that God Almighty has done this wonderful thing for you, continue to honour Him,
    <br>follow Him and receive instruction from Him
    <br>and we pray that God Almighty will give you grace to be a good leader
    <br>in Jesus' Name.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.
