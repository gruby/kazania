  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our names are Mr Pascal Mpoy
    <br>and the person beside me is Mrs Gillian Mpoy
    <br>and the little one is Miss Precious Mpoy.
    <br>We come from South Africa.
    <br>You are very welcome. Please tell us your testimony.
    <br>Our testimony goes like this:
    <br>At the time the child was born,
    <br>later on, after the check-up,
    <br>they discovered that she had a hole in her heart.
    <br>I was pressurised by the doctor to do surgery to close the pipe in her heart
    <br>and the documentation was sent to me to approve and go ahead with the surgery.
    <br>I was informed about the surgery
    <br>but I delayed it because
    <br>according to that procedure,
    <br>they had to use a PDA
    <br>which is a device which had to be implanted in her heart.
    <br>I questioned the doctor to find out the advantages and disadvantages of this surgery.
    <br>I was told that the only advantage was
    <br>that the procedure would trigger a spring
    <br>which would push the device to close the pipe in the heart.
    <br>The disadvantage was that
    <br>the spring would trigger the device and remain in her heart.
    <br>Then I couldn't take any decision at that time.
    <br>As a couple, my wife and I had to decide whether we should go ahead with the surgery or not.
    <br>I thank God that the doctor was a believer as well and was aware of The SCOAN.
    <br>I told him that we first wanted to find out God's opinion about the surgery.
    <br>The doctor told us that based on his medical knowledge,
    <br>he would not recommend releasing the child in that condition.
    <br>However, he would agree to do so.
    <br>But he asked whether we were able to bring the child to The SCOAN.
    <br>At that time, the Morning Water was ministered to the child.
    <br>We went back again for another check-up.
    <br>They examined the child and discovered that the hole was completely healed.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>LITTLE Girl Receives BIG Miracle!!!
    <br>When we went for the second check-up,
    <br>and the doctor examined the child,
    <br>he re-examined her three times.
    <br>He said, "This is a miracle! The noise I used to hear previously has disappeared completely".
    <br>We were very amazed and it brought peace to us.
    <br>We were so happy and we have been thanking God since then.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for the King of glory.
    <br>LITTLE Girl Receives BIG Miracle!!!
    <br>We can see some medical reports next to you.
    <br>Could you please explain a little bit about them to us.
    <br>This is the first medical report.
    <br>It says here that she was required to have a surgical closure, the PDA.
    <br>That is the device the doctor recommended to close the pipe.
    <br>This document is a quotation which was sent to me for the surgery.
    <br>They were requesting my signature to be approved,
    <br>but I did not sign this document to approve the operation.
    <br>This document was for the administration fees to admit the child for the surgery.
    <br>The second medical report was issued after the ministration of the Morning Water.
    <br>It says here, "Miss Precious Mpoy is well, healthy, fit and she is not under any chronic medication.
    <br>And she does not require any PDA closure anymore".
    <br>- So that was how she was healed.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus. Louder.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Mpoy & Daughter
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>My name is Gillian Mpoy. We are from South Africa.
    <br>This situation was very terrible.
    <br>I remember they gave us a machine which we had to put next to the child every time she slept
    <br>so that if something went wrong,
    <br>the alarm would be triggered
    <br>and we would wake up to see whether the child was still alive.
    <br>In that situation it is impossible to sleep properly or even focus on what you are doing.
    <br>I said to my husband, "No, we are believers. We must not do the surgery.
    <br>Her heart is in God's hands.
    <br>We can't control her heart. Let's take this machine back to the hospital".
    <br>We took it back and stayed at home with the child, watching Emmanuel TV and praying.
    <br>And we were fine.
    <br>My advice is that life is full of challenges.
    <br>Don't think that if you are a Christian you won't go through something like this.
    <br>If challenges come, just stand strong through the Word of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Mpoy & Daughter
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>My advice goes like this:
    <br>In such situations, as a believer, we need to keep our focus on God.
    <br>At that time my conscience was very calm.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua recently said, "Don't ignore your conscience.
    <br>Your conscience is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide us".
    <br>So, I was quite calm because I knew the situation was there
    <br>but I decided not to focus on that situation.
    <br>Because the more you focus on that situation, it will mislead you as a Christian.
    <br>So, stand firm in the Word of God,
    <br>meditate on His Word,
    <br>and work on what God has already spoken.
    <br>That is my advice to viewers all over the world
    <br>and to my fellow brothers in this auditorium.
    <br>This is what I stood on.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus once again.

    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Precious Mpoy is five years old now.
    <br>Okay, let us hear from her.
    <br>- Hello.
    <br>- Good Morning!
    <br>- What is your name?
    <br>- Precious.
    <br>- How do you feel?
    <br>- I am just fine.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Mpoy & Daughter
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>We are very glad about what God Almighty has done in the life of your family
    <br>and we want to encourage you to make God's Word the standard for your family
    <br>so that you can maintain this miracle, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
