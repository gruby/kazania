    <br>Ask for mercy.
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua encouraged the people to ask for the mercy of God upon their lives
    <br>during The SCOAN Living Water Service.
    <br>With humility and simplicity of heart, Prophet T.B. Joshua went on his knees before the Lord
    <br>at The SCOAN Mountain of Prayer to offer the desires of his heart and the petitions of his people.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua walks from one end of the mountain to another
    <br>continually offering spirit-filled prayer, as directed by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>As the Book of John 7:38 says, "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said,
    <br>from his innermost being will flow rivers of the living water".
    <br>As directed by the Holy Spirit,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua consecrates the row of taps and drinks from the Living Water
    <br>before ushering the people to pray and receive their own portion of the Living Water
    <br>at The SCOAN Mountain of Prayer.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>What are you asking for?
    <br>Mercy! Say it after me: Mercy!
    <br>This is the voice that should come from your heart.
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>As you are going there, ask for mercy.
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Okay, it's your turn.
    <br>The people step out with their cups to take the Living Water
    <br>as Abraham's blessings await them.
    <br>Those that are tormented with one affliction or the other are set free in the presence of God
    <br>at The SCOAN Mountain of Prayer.
    <br>Among the multitudes seeking the face of God for healing, deliverance and breakthrough, is this young man.
    <br>Immediately after drinking the Living Water, he is no longer comfortable with himself and he begins to cough.
    <br>What is happening to him? That is the question.
    <br>Remember, where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>Miraculously, this young man vomited three strange objects.
    <br>A clearer view of these objects shows three cowries.
    <br>My name is Desmond.
    <br>I came from Kogi State, Nigeria.
    <br>I was initiated into a cult.
    <br>These are the powers I was given - the powers of destruction to kill and to destroy.
    <br>Whenever I was shot at, it could not penetrate.
    <br>Whenever I was about to be arrested, before the police could get to my position,
    <br>my chest would speed up and give me a sign that something was about to happen to me.
    <br>It gave me the power to disappear.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Desmond.
    <br>I am a Nigerian. I come from Kogi State.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is the spirit of occultist,
    <br>and I thank God for my deliverance.
    <br>On Monday, I was sitting at the back, when the man of God went to the Mountain of Prayer.
    <br>He said that we should ask for mercy.
    <br>I was praying, asking God for mercy - that God should have mercy on me.
    <br>Immediately when I got to the Mountain of Prayer, I prayed that the Lord should have mercy on me.
    <br>When I drank the Living Water, my stomach became unsettled.
    <br>I felt that I wanted to vomit.
    <br>I tried to hold the vomit back, but I couldn't because the power there is greater than the power in me.
    <br>So, I just had to vomit out these objects.
    <br>After I vomited, I saw that there were three cowries.
    <br>These cowries are the power that was given to me when I was initiated.
    <br>I swallowed a lot of things.
    <br>How old were you when you were initiated, and tell us how it happened.
    <br>I was 14 years old when I was initiated and it happened when I was in my GS3.
    <br>I was initiated through a friend in the form of a drink.
    <br>I had finished my Junior Waec and we decided to celebrate.
    <br>I got drunk. I remember that I drank belize and punch.
    <br>I was on a high immediately and I did not know what had happened.
    <br>The next day I woke up in the hospital, after the initiation.
    <br>I had wounds on my legs and hands.
    <br>I was beaten and a lot of things happened, which I don't remember.
    <br>The evil spirit in me affected me greatly.
    <br>It gave me the power to fight, destroy, kill and steal - just to destroy people.
    <br>As a cult, we fought each other.
    <br>Whenever an issue of a woman arose, we fought each other with tools like guns, cutlasses, axes and so forth.
    <br>People hired and paid us.
    <br>This evil power boosted me.
    <br>There were times when I would reflect on my life and realised that what we were doing was not good.
    <br>The Spirit of God would convict me about the things that I was doing.
    <br>But then the evil power would overtake me again and get me to destroy.
    <br>The more I fought, killed and destroyed, the greater my powers became.
    <br>Eventually I was able to disappear.
    <br>The evil power also warned me. Whenever I had to go out on a mission and I felt a sensation in my chest,
    <br>I knew that there was a possibility that I could die, so I would go back and do incantations.
    <br>When you made those incantations, what happened?
    <br>Once I made the incantations, I disappeared.
    <br>And when I disappeared, I would not be at the place that I felt that I should be.
    <br>At times I would disappear and find myself at the market, on a tree or anywhere.
    <br>So, I would just find my way to escape.
    <br>And when I said the incantation again, I would disappear again to another place.
    <br>We went to schools and universities because they all had their own levels.
    <br>They would recognise us and they would recognise my own level; I was the second in command.
    <br>My role as second in command was that when the leader said anything
    <br>I was the one who told you to accept it or not.
    <br>So, I had the final say.
    <br>In 2012, I was at NYSC Camp.
    <br>We went there to carry out initiations and execute other things.
    <br>When we arrived, the soldiers asked us what we were doing there and then they shot at us.
    <br>We then returned fire.
    <br>When the soldier cocked the gun to shoot me, the gun malfunctioned.
    <br>In situations where they actually shot at you, did the bullets ever affect you?
    <br>Yes, during the elections. The bullets would fall and I would pick them up.
    <br>- You picked up the bullets?
    <br>- Yes, I picked up the bullets.
    <br>What do you mean? What happened when they shot at you?
    <br>When they shot at me, I would feel the bullets falling down off my body.
    <br>Do you mean that the bullets never penetrated your body?
    <br>- No, not at all.
    <br>- Why?
    <br>- Because of these charms; because of these cowries.
    <br>- Because of these cowrie charms?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Whenever we went on missions, we were given a lot of money - millions.
    <br>Whenever I got the money I would smoke, do drugs, go to clubs and hire prostitutes.
    <br>What brought me here to The SCOAN was that whenever I slept, I was not at peace.
    <br>The people that I had destroyed would appear to me in my dreams.
    <br>They would chase me.
    <br>Whenever I had an issue, I would go to a specific witchdoctor.
    <br>I would tell him what I was experiencing, but he would tell me not to worry.
    <br>- You mean you had no peace?
    <br>- Yes. I had no peace.
    <br>The people that you destroyed would appear to you in the dream and they would chase you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>- So that is why you decided to come here for deliverance?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>When I came, I prayed as the man of God instructed us to do - that we should ask for mercy.
    <br>Asking for mercy is all I prayed for, "Just have mercy on me".
    <br>When I stepped onto the Mountain of Prayer, I found mercy, to the glory of God.

    <br>When I drank the Living Water, I felt my stomach turn.
    <br>My stomach was really bothering me, so I had to vomit.
    <br>I tried to stop the vomiting, but I couldn't.
    <br>When I vomited, I vomited the three cowries.
    <br>And since then, after you vomited these three cowries?
    <br>I have been okay. I feel well.
    <br>I sleep well. I have not had nightmares again. I am okay.
    <br>And the urge to kill, steal and destroy?
    <br>I don't have time for that anymore.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?
    <br>WATCH Man Vomits PHYSICAL DEMON Live In Church!!!
    <br>I did not swallow these charms.
    <br>The witchdoctor who prepared the charm for us called it - he spoke to it.
    <br>They were placed in us in a dream.
    <br>Okay, so you mean the witchdoctor that initiated you with these charms did not give you the cowries to swallow?
    <br>No, not at all.
    <br>He just made some incantation and commanded the cowries and they came inside of you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So it was in a dream that you confirmed that the cowries were inside of you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How did you feel, because cowries are foreign objects in the body -
    <br>originally, it is not meant to be part of the body?
    <br>Tell us, how did you feel carrying these cowries inside you?
    <br>Did they speak to you? How did you know that something was working inside of you?
    <br>These cowries are an evil spirit.
    <br>Physically you can see it as a cowrie, but it isn't a real cowrie.
    <br>It is an evil spirit that directs.
    <br>It is just like a human being that lives.
    <br>It changed my flesh.
    <br>Whenever it told me to do things, I would act immediately.
    <br>Whenever I wanted to disappear, after the incantation, my body would get hot.
    <br>The witchdoctor purposefully gave the charm to me so that I could disappear.
    <br>He knew that I wanted to disappear, so he positioned me wherever I would be.
    <br>You said that you used to get a sign before you would disappear. What were the signs?
    <br>I would get a sensation in my chest that it was time to go.
    <br>If there was a situation which I couldn't avoid anymore, I would drop my legs
    <br>and after the incantation I would disappear.
    <br>At times, the police arrived and we were in a gun fight with them.
    <br>If the power of the person I was fighting was more than mine, the evil spirit would tell me to go.
    <br>- When you sensed that there was going to be danger, ...
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>... then your left side of your chest would hurt and you would say the incantation.
    <br>Yes, there were various incantations. I said, " ... "
    <br>Immediately when I stepped, I would disappear.
    <br>At times I would find myself where I could see things happening around me, but no one would be able to see me,
    <br>but I would see them.
    <br>Lately, after I disappeared and reappeared, you could not see me instantly.
    <br>It would only be after some hours passed by before people could see me again.
    <br>When I disappeared, I found myself in a tree.
    <br>When I said another incantation, I found myself in the river.
    <br>Then I discovered that I was wet and was sinking.
    <br>I would have to say another incantation.
    <br>The witchdoctor would speak to me in the spirit and tell me that it was dangerous and I had to leave.
    <br>So, I said many incantations.
    <br>The evil power helped me move between the physical and the spiritual realms.
    <br>I would be in the spirit and leave the world.
    <br>Whenever I wanted to appear again, I would say the incantation.
    <br>The advice that I have for the youth out there ...
    <br>I know a lot of people are watching me.
    <br>I don't even know how it happened, but all the glory to God.
    <br>I never thought I would be here today.
    <br>My advice to people out there is: There is nothing to gain from a secret cult.
    <br>It will just waste and destroy your life.
    <br>But I thank God for my deliverance at The SCOAN.

    <br>- These things involve a sacrifice.
    <br>- It involves sacrifice?
    <br>- Yes, for seven days.
    <br>- For seven days?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- It is meant to remain in you for life?
    <br>Yes. Immediately after I vomited the cowries,
    <br>I knew that the witchdoctor would feel that something came out from me.
    <br>A lot of things would be destroyed on his altar or in his shrine, which he would also know.
    <br>WATCH Man Vomits PHYSICAL DEMON Live In Church!!!
    <br>In other words, the power of the cowries that was inside you
    <br>was directly connected to the witchdoctor that commanded them into you.
    <br>Anything that happened to the cowries, he would know. That is what you are saying?
    <br>Yes. And if anything happened to me, he would know.
    <br>As you are standing now, now that God Almighty has delivered you,
    <br>is there still any sign of a connection between you and the witchdoctor?
    <br>- No more.
    <br>- No more.
    <br>- You are disconnected?
    <br>- I'm disconnected.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>WATCH Man Vomits PHYSICAL DEMON Live In Church!!!
    <br>What can you say about that Mountain of Prayer and the Living Water?
    <br>You can see the Mountain of Prayer physically.
    <br>But when I stepped through the gate, I did not see it as a mountain anymore.
    <br>I wanted to go back, but I was shy.
    <br>People shouldn't think that this mountain has rituals or something like that.
    <br>Immediately when I stepped there, I felt fire there.
    <br>That was when I lay down on the mountain and I felt the fire working in me. That's what I felt there.
    <br>- You mean, that place is full of fire?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>And only that fire could have cast out this power from you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?
    <br>Can you tell us, as someone who possessed negative power - contrary power -
    <br>and you knew you were going into the light, what were the thoughts going in your heart
    <br>and how did you feel before and when you stepped onto the Mountain of Prayer?
    <br>Can you share your experience with us and what did you feel, what did you see?
    <br>When I was in church and when the evil power was still in me,
    <br>I felt something moving in my stomach.
    <br>When I went to the altar, I just felt the fire.
    <br>You mean, it was when you are able to experience what is there that you know the value of the Mountain of Prayer?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- And you experienced it? You felt that fire?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- And it was the fire that delivered you?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Shall we put our hands together for Jesus?
    <br>Have you at any time of your life felt what you felt when you stepped onto the Mountain of Prayer?
    <br>Many people have tried to deliver me, but they couldn't.
    <br>- What do you mean?
    <br>- I thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What do you mean, "They couldn't?"
    <br>There were some crusades that I went to and
    <br>there were prophecies that, "There is a man that ... occultist ... " and I would just go on my own.
    <br>They even called my name.
    <br>But when I stood in front of them, they would look at my eyes.
    <br>Maybe they were scared. I don't know.
    <br>They just asked me to go; that the Lord would deliver me. That is what they said.
    <br>But when I came to The SCOAN, I could see that there is power; the power of God is here.
