    <br>The Town Where Prophet T.B. Joshua Was Brought Up - Arigidi, Ondo State Nigeria
    <br>In 1963, a humble home, in the rural district of Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria,
    <br>became the scene of an incredible miracle, a child had finally been born after 15 months in his mother's womb.
    <br>However, anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>The devil attempted to snatch away this young life just days later but what the devil meant for evil,
    <br>God meant for good.
    <br>Moving through the compound we arrived at the small house in which Prophet T.B. Joshua was raised
    <br>and spent his childhood days.
    <br>A closer inspection of the roof reveals a noticeably large hole.
    <br>What could possibly have happened to create such damage?

    <br>Peering through the hole, a jet stone can be seen lying on the floor of this modest home.
    <br>Inside The Childhood Home of Prophet T.B.Joshua
    <br>This is the small room in which Prophet T.B.Joshua grew up with his family.
    <br>This is a house with a remarkable story to tell.
    <br>A Hole In The Roof Of Prophet T.B Joshua's Childhood Home In Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria
    <br>Let someone who was there that day tell you the story and unravel the mystery.
    <br>In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
    <br>A water pipe was being dug at a nearby site and you were laid here sleeping.
    <br>Shockingly, a stone flew from the site through this zinc and landed very close to where you were sleeping.
    <br>Where is the stone?
    <br>Has the stone been kept since then?
    <br>It is the very one. We did not throw it away ever since.
    <br>When they gave birth to you and you were about to be named.
    <br>This is where we all were sleeping and where we gave birth to all our children.
    <br>We did not sleep elsewhere.
    <br>If one could go outside, the broken part of the zinc that was covered is still visible.
    <br>You were laid here and the stone fell beside you.
    <br>Is this the particular stone?
    <br>This was the point it was broken.
    <br>This was the point it was broken. Can you see it?
    <br>So what later happened to me?
    <br>Jesus rescued you and made you healthy.
    <br>I did not throw it away. It is part of history.
    <br>Somebody advised me to smoothen it and use it as grinding stone but I refused
    <br>because of the mysterious and miraculous role God used it to play in this family.
    <br>It wasn't like this on the day the incident occurred.
    <br>Eventually, however, we shall create a special box in the store.
    <br>This is how you were laid on the ground; your mother slept close to you.
    <br>There was a local lamp near your mother's head and a fire used to treat your mother's stomach.
    <br>The stone suddenly crashed down near you. Before God and men, that was what happened.
    <br>Glory be to the name of the Lord.

    <br>I am his step mother.
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua's Childhood Home In Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria
    <br>Now, I want to begin to show you some records. Let me start from my birth.
    <br>The record I am about to show you is not saying I have arrived
    <br>but to encourage the weak and those without fast legs or human help
    <br>that there is hope - Jesus is the hope.
    <br>I stayed in my mother's womb for fifteen months.
    <br>At nine months, my mother was moving from one medical centre to another
    <br>because she was in labour.
    <br>From nine months, my mother began labour and she was moving from one medical centre
    <br>to another hospital until she was carried to a place called Egbe Medical Centre.
    <br>At that time, it seemed to be the best hospital in Nigeria, if not one of the best.
    <br>Go to the record.
    <br>So let's see the picture of the hospital where finally my mummy gave birth to me.
    <br>This is the Picture of Egbe Hospital Where I Was Born At Last After My Mother Visited Many Medical Centres
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I was delivered and about to be named on the seventh day in a naming ceremony
    <br>arrangements were made and many guests turned up to see the child
    <br>who spent fifteen months in mother's womb.
    <br>You can imagine the number of people that were present.
    <br>In our village, there is so much rock that needs to be blasted before getting water.
    <br>It became a habit; everyday, they had to blast to get water from the ground.
    <br>Opposite the house where I was to be named
    <br>there was a company that was blasting rock for water.
    <br>Suddenly, a very big stone flew from the opposite direction straight to the same humble home
    <br>and landed on the exact net where I was lying.
    <br>What happened? No one knows how Baby Joshua moved from the net to the other side of the room.
    <br>What happened to the mother? She fainted, went into a coma and was carried to the hospital.
    <br>The guests and the people waiting for ceremony: "What happened? We are here to see the fifteen-months baby
    <br>that was delivered. Now, this is what happened - the baby saved".
    <br>Out of sheer wonder and surprise, they started voicing different names.
    <br>Temitope, Tope, Temidire, Temioluwa, Temidayo - different names.
    <br>I decided to choose Temitope out of all those names.
    <br>The stone they found when they were blasting rock - this is it.
    <br>The Stone That Flew Through The Roof And Landed Next To Where T.B. Joshua Lay at 7 Days Old
    <br>This is the stone. This is T.B. Joshua!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The Stone That Flew Through The Roof And Landed Next To Where T.B. Joshua Lay at 7 Days Old
    <br>I'm older than the stone by seven days!
    <br>It came out on the seventh day, when I was to be named.
    <br>So the stone must be fifty....
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Like I have said...
    <br>We are not showing you this because we are saying we have arrived but
    <br>it is an encouragement to the weak, to those without fast legs and
    <br>those without human help, underprivileged - that there is hope and Jesus is the hope.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So we begin to show you now where the ministry started from - from little, and the name SCOAN.
    <br>The foundation of the church - we will show you now, you will see.
    <br>All this is not acting; it's real. It's a real record.
