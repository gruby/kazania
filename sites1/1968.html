    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit of truth to reveal Jesus to you.
    <br>How many of us worship Him with ideas and imagination?
    <br>Salvation without contentment is not salvation.
    <br>Contentment is what we call salvation.
    <br>Politics have become a religion to the whole world; it is politics we have faith in, not God.
    <br>We have to be content, to know what we are doing.
    <br>Open your lips and ask God.
    <br>Holy Spirit of truth, reveal Jesus to me.
    <br>Prayer.

    <br>Holy Spirit of truth, reveal Jesus to me.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray.
    <br>Who is Jesus? That is the question for your heart.
    <br>I am talking to your heart.
    <br>Who is Jesus now?
    <br>If Jesus is revealed to you, He is your Saviour, Redeemer, the finisher of your faith.
    <br>Your heart, right now, should begin to yearn for Jesus.
    <br>Jesus, Jesus, Jesus - yearning for Jesus - the voice of Jesus in your heart.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>Trust and Obey
    <br>For there is no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>Than to trust and obey
    <br>I'm leaving the message for your heart; it is a question of the heart.
    <br>Trust and Obey
    <br>For there is no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>Than to trust and obey
    <br>Trust and Obey
    <br>For there is no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>Than to trust and obey
    <br>It is time to think of your track record, now and yesterday, and reconcile the two.
    <br>Where are you coming from?
    <br>Are you supposed to be living?
    <br>Are you sure you have not done something that would have led you to the graveyard?
    <br>You know many of your friends are in the graveyard.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>Can we call it a second chance?
    <br>We are messing up the grace.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>Now, it is time to begin to do what we have never done before.
    <br>Trust Jesus; that is what we have never done before.
    <br>There is nothing we have not done - but to trust Jesus in truth and faith, we have not.
    <br>You need rescue.
    <br>Jesus is ready to rescue you.
    <br>The answer now is to get used to loneliness and Jesus will be your all.
    <br>Trust on majority without authority is failure.
    <br>We trust on majority not authority.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>Before now, you had friends that seem to have everything,
    <br>but now you can see that everybody has problems.
    <br>Those friends have problems.
    <br>People you run to, they have problems.
    <br>The difference between you and them - you have a way out; they have no way out.
    <br>Open your lips and pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>Ask Him to be the Spirit of adoption to you.
    <br>"Be the Spirit of adoption to me."
    <br>Lord Jesus, be the Spirit of adoption to me.
    <br>I thank You for forgiving and freeing me from the law of sin and death.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>Be the Spirit of adoption to me. Father me.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Your heart can tell you your position now.
    <br>Have you been adopted or not?
    <br>If you have been adopted, you hear the voice in your heart.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The voice of God in your heart.
    <br>Heart, hear the voice of God.
    <br>Hear the voice of God!
    <br>Release yourself. Cry to Him.
    <br>Heart, hear the voice of God.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>The Words of God must have access to your heart.
    <br>The real thing about you is not your body but your heart, your spirit - heart means spirit.
    <br>Heart, hear the voice of God.
    <br>I break every door that locks your heart.
    <br>Be broken!
    <br>Every key that locks your heart, release right now.
    <br>I say to your heart: be opened!
    <br>When one's heart is locked, you cannot hear the message of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit that makes the message work.
    <br>There are messages, and there are messages of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>I open your heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be opened!
    <br>My heart, be convinced, be converted!
    <br>Open your lips. Prayer!
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>If there is any prayer you need to pray, this is the one.
    <br>This is the main prayer, the prayer you need.
    <br>You can have the access, you can hear the voice of God, you can relate with your Father;
    <br>you will relate with Him as children relate with their father - like father like son.
    <br>Our heart is the communication point, contact point.
    <br>Some of our hearts are dead.
    <br>The real thing about us is our heart, not our body, not mental assent.
    <br>When your heart is open, everything becomes an integral part of your being.
    <br>We must break that...
    <br>Be ready with me; let us pray particularly on that.
    <br>I say my heart, be opened, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>My heart, contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>We have prayed that the Spirit of Truth shall reveal Jesus.
    <br>If the Spirit has revealed Jesus to you as our Lord and Saviour, what else again?
    <br>But some hearts are locked, imprisoned because of many wrongs.
    <br>As a child of God, you should have access, pray, understand and hear the voice of God.
    <br>God is your Father.
    <br>I open your heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I open your heart to the Holy Spirit, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I open your heart to the Spirit of the Father, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be opened!
    <br>You will leave here today and dream dreams.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>That is God's design for you.
    <br>You will leave here and dream dreams.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>My heart, be opened!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Our heart should be open to the Gospel of Christ.
    <br>Let there be light in your heart!
    <br>Let there be life in your heart!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Do you know what it means when there is life in your heart?
    <br>You hear the voice of God, you hear God clearly, you pray and pray with Him, you dream dreams.
    <br>This is what makes you born again, these are the works of salvation.
    <br>When you are saved, your heart is lightened.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>Be in an attitude of prayer, right now.
    <br>Lord Jesus, my heart is a dwelling place.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Call the Holy Spirit; call the Spirit of the Father.
    <br>It is a dwelling place.
    <br>Any things that are not of God, be flushed out!
    <br>Command them!
    <br>My heart is a dwelling place!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, you can begin to invite the Kingdom of God into your heart.
    <br>Invite the Kingdom of God into your heart.
    <br>Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done
    <br>Begin to invite the Kingdom of God, let the Kingdom of God take over.
    <br>Take over!
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Begin to invite the Kingdom of God with the prayer we have offered, to flush out anything that is not of God.
    <br>Your will within your heart has been flushed out - Take over!
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>Your heart is Heaven, let the Kingdom come.
    <br>Kingdom come! Take over!
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now when the Kingdom of God comes, all the urge for this and for that, fleshly desires, is gone.
    <br>I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Believe this voice; just surrender.
    <br>You are disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>All those things that are tempting you, negative thoughts, fleshly desires, your will - not God's will.
    <br>This is what you want to do, but this is what you find yourself doing.
    <br>What you want to do is not what you are doing; what you want to say is not what you have said.
    <br>You are disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to disconnect yourself.
    <br>Name those weaknesses that are tempting you day by day.
    <br>Disconnect yourself, right now.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Agree with me that you are saved today.
    <br>Say, "I thank You, Lord; I believe you died in my place and I have received Your salvation.
    <br>Thank You for Your salvation."
    <br>Open your lips and confess this and give thanks to God.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Worship Him and rejoice!
    <br>Right now, we open our lips and ask for His divine health on our physical body.
    <br>You are to confess God's Word over your situation.
    <br>God's Word says: Let the sick say, 'I am healed!'
    <br>- I can't hear you.
    <br>- I am healed!
    <br>- God's Word says what?
    <br>- I am healed!
    <br>Let the sick say, 'I am healed!'
    <br>I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Place your hand wherever you have that pain, that discomfort.
    <br>Lord Jesus!
    <br>Wherever that pain, affliction is located, I command healing, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>- Affliction, wherever it is located.
    <br>- Out!
    <br>You have to trace the affliction in your spirit before you shout 'out!'
    <br>Whatever in your physical body, be it cancer, HIV, whatever in your kidneys, blood, liver, bones,
    <br>wherever it is located, I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That disease, out!
    <br>Out in your blood, kidney, liver!
    <br>Say, "Out!"

    <br>Will you tell affliction, 'This is not your place'?

    <br>Tell affliction: This is not your place!
    <br>Command them out!
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>You can see people vomiting out blood substances, different substances from their system.
    <br>This can only be done by the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Every stranger in your system shall be flushed out.
    <br>HEAR THE VOICE OF GOD!!! | Anointed Mass Prayer | TB Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray.
