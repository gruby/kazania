    <br>Viewers, ask Jesus to locate you in His mercy.
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy, Lord, and deliver me!
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy and heal me, Lord!
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy and free me!
    <br>Lord, Jesus, locate me in Your mercy and free me!
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy and deliver me!
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy and free me!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy and heal me!
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy and deliver me!
    <br>You are declared free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Wherever it is located in your body - hear the voice of God!
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>You sickness, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>You affliction, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Whatever name they call it - never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>You cancer, affliction - leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>You are declared free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Begin to talk in your freedom.
    <br>Jesus says, "You are healed!"
    <br>You are healed!
    <br>I say, "You are healed!"
