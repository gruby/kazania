    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>You alone are God.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Good morning, people of God.
    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Good morning!"
    <br>Greet the viewers watching us, "Good morning."
    <br>You may be seated in His presence.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Have your seats.
    <br>Let someone say, "God's time is the best; that's why I am here at God's appointed time."
    <br>If you are here at God's appointed time, something will happen to you today.
    <br>What you have been waiting for will happen today.
    <br>Say, "At God's time everything is beautiful."
    <br>My life will never be the same again!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes brethren, God's time is the best.
    <br>We are living in a world without faith, without patience.
    <br>Like what happened to King Saul in the Book of 1 Samuel 13:8-14.
    <br>Untimely decision because of pressure, tension and impatience
    <br>has led to action that has bitterly changed the life and destiny of so many people today.
    <br>Time is our challenge because we fail to understand that life is a marathon, not a sprint.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Life is a marathon, not a sprint."
    <br>What do I mean by a sprint?
    <br>We are living in a world, in a generation, where everyone wants to get to a place at his own time.
    <br>"Www dot generation".
    <br>You go on-line; there is nothing you cannot get.
    <br>I just came from a country, where you can buy everything on-line.
    <br>Everything you can talk of is available.
    <br>Today, on-line, there is nothing you cannot get.
    <br>On-line you can get a partner;
    <br>you start developing love towards the person you have never known.
    <br>Because of impatience we keep opening doors that God has not opened.
    <br>We keep taking what God has not given yet.
    <br>Brethren, we need to understand that life is a marathon.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>Life does not just happen to us; it is all about the choices we make
    <br>and how we respond to every situation in life.
    <br>How do we run that race?
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua says that
    <br>the journey of life starts with the truth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The journey of life starts with the truth."
    <br>This means packaging, with respect to the truth, is deceptive.
    <br>Patience is the power that forces that deception to reveal itself.
    <br>How do we run the race?
    <br>Make sure you include God in every decision you make.
    <br>Don't be too quick to trust.
    <br>Make sure the person you put your trust in is led by God every day.
    <br>Watch and pray.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, watch and pray."
    <br>Watch and pray because you need to know the truth,
    <br>you need to be convinced concerning God's will in that matter
    <br>before God Almighty will back you up.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't beat the gun."
    <br>You know, when the race is about to start, you wait for the gun - don't beat the gun.
    <br>Wait for God's appointed time.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't beat the gun. Wait for God's appointed time."
    <br>Wait for God's appointed time because no one can come to a place of fulfillment without God.
    <br>No one can come to a place of true happiness and joy without Jesus.
    <br>This leads me to my message to you today:
    <br>GOD'S APPOINTED TIME
    <br>Let me quickly take you to the Book of Habakkuk 2; I start my reading from verse 2.
    <br>"Then the Lord answered me and said: 'Write the vision
    <br>and make it plain on tablets, that he may run who reads it.
    <br>For the vision is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it will speak, and it will not lie.
    <br>Though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come,
    <br>it will not tarry.
    <br>Behold the proud, his soul is not upright in him;
    <br>but the just shall live by his faith' ".
    <br>Let someone say, "The just shall live by faith."
    <br>Faith is expecting God to do what He has promised to you.
    <br>God speaks to us through His Word and by His Spirit.
    <br>This means true faith depends not on what we think but on what God has said.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, true faith depends not on what you think but on what God has said."
    <br>God speaks to us through the Holy Word - the Bible,
    <br>reveals His view on a certain matter and then gives us a promise.
    <br>Faith comes from such a promise.
    <br>God speaks to you and me through the Holy Word - the Bible,
    <br>reveals His view, will, purpose in that matter and then gives us a promise - the way out.
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>In Genesis 18:14, God made a promise to Abraham saying:
    <br>"At the appointed time I will visit you and Sarah, your wife, will have a child".
    <br>Without the promise of God, His will, His time, His way, our faith is in vain -
    <br>our faith is not real.
    <br>There must be a promise of God in your life.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Neighbour, do you know God's promise for your life today?"
    <br>There must be a promise of God in your life for faith to be real.
    <br>Faith is the certainty of God's yet unfulfilled promises.
    <br>Therefore, if you have faith in God, you must put your trust in His way, in His will, in His time.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, do you know the promise of God in your life?"
    <br>God's promises are recorded in God's Word.
    <br>The Word of God helps us walk with God, helps us receive from God and fulfill God's will on earth.
    <br>The promise of God gives us hope and expectation.
    <br>It gives us expectation because that promise is for an appointed time, determined by God Himself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God's time is the best!"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, I don't care what happens to you now; God's time is the best."
    <br>God has set an appointed time, the right time for everything in this world -
    <br>a time to talk and a time to be silent,
    <br>a time for a movement and a time to be still,
    <br>a time to fight and a time to settle,
    <br>a time to be born and a time to die.
    <br>Let's see how our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ uses time factor
    <br>to determine everything that has to do with Him.
    <br>Right at the beginning of His mission,
    <br>in John 2, when they rushed Jesus because there was not enough wine,
    <br>Jesus said to Mary, "Mother, my time has not yet come."
    <br>When Jesus' brothers wanted to press Him to go to the feast,
    <br>Jesus said in John 7:2-6, "My time has not yet come."
    <br>When it was time for Jesus to depart, go back to the Father,
    <br>He said in John 17:1, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son that Your Son may glorify You".
    <br>How Jesus used time factor?
    <br>When they sent for Jesus because Lazarus was sick and at the point of death,
    <br>Jesus never moved.
    <br>Jesus Christ was never rushed by the emergency of others because He knew God's time is the best.
    <br>It was at Lazarus' death that Jesus set in motion towards the house of Lazarus.
    <br>The Scripture says that was the right time for Jesus to reveal His name as the resurrection and the life.
    <br>God is whom you need Him to be in your situation.
    <br>When Jesus came to the graveside, He sent forth the Living Word,
    <br>Lazarus came forth and he came back to life.
    <br>What time are you in?
    <br>We learn from our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ that
    <br>the people of vision do things at God's appointed time.
    <br>They act at God's appointed time - at the right time.
    <br>Whatever people say about them does not matter because they know that God's time is the best.
    <br>Are you facing poverty and they mock you?
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Are you facing barrenness?
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Jesus knew that God's time is the best.
    <br>This means there are two times: human and divine,
    <br>God's time and man's time.
    <br>Which of these two controls your life?
    <br>Which of these two controls your vision, your plan, your action today?
    <br>Let someone say, "God's time is the best."
    <br>In the Book of Luke 2:14-33, ask Simeon and he will tell you that
    <br>when it is time for the promise of God to be made manifest in your life,
    <br>there will be a driving force that will change your actions and your location called inner grace.
    <br>Let someone say, "Inner grace".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>when it is time for the promise of God to be made manifest in your life,
    <br>there will be a driving force that will change your actions, your location - inner grace."
    <br>At God's appointed time we enjoy the inner grace.
    <br>When we do things at God's appointed time, it is effortless; you don't need to sweat.
    <br>Not by power, not by might, by My Spirit.
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>"What time are you in?
    <br>What you are doing now, what you are about to do,
    <br>what you are planning - are you doing it at God's appointed time?"
    <br>The will of God, the promise of God, is a thing of the heart.
    <br>I mean, it demands processing.
    <br>It is not "cash & carry", "see & buy", "see & take", "see & admire", "see & love", "see & accept", "see & take".
    <br>You see a woman and you want to marry her immediately.
    <br>You see a man and you want to get married immediately, without processing.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>the will of God, the promise of God, demands processing."
    <br>Ask your neighbour again, "Is it time to act?
    <br>Make up your mind - is it time to act?"
    <br>Make up your mind in the presence of God.
    <br>If it is time to act, you need to think first inwardly.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, think first before you act."
    <br>The Scripture says that when you think right, you are training yourself to act right.
    <br>There is time to listen and a time to act.
    <br>Time to listen is time to examine everything in the light of God's Word - sit and reflect.
    <br>No matter the winds and storms you are going through, sit down and reflect.
    <br>Meditation in the Word of God brings revelation.
    <br>Revelation means the knowledge of the truth, the knowledge of the will of God in that matter.
    <br>Revelation brings conviction.
    <br>Let someone say, "Mediation brings revelation - knowledge of the truth, knowledge of God's will."
    <br>Revelation brings conviction - acceptance of the truth, acceptance of the will of God,
    <br>a heart decision.
    <br>It is our hearts that agree first, that marry first, not our body but opposite is the case today.
    <br>Conviction of heart brings real movement.
    <br>Let someone say, "Conviction brings real movement."
    <br>This means the right time to act.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit's intimation, suggestion, that brings about the right time to act.
    <br>The Bible says, at each step you take, each decision, movement, action,
    <br>suggestion must come from the Spirit that such action should be performed.
    <br>In other words, it is when the revealing Word of God enters our hearts
    <br>that our spirit acts upon the Word of God.
    <br>When our spirit acts upon the Word of God revealed by the Holy Spirit
    <br>then we act right because we act in unison with God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the way out for you has come.
    <br>Remember, you are a child of promise."
    <br>There is a promise of God in your life - be it in your home, your business, destiny, ministry.
    <br>Finally brethren, God's plan for our lives is beautiful.
    <br>I say, God's time for your life is beautiful!
    <br>No matter the storms and vicissitudes of life, God's plan for you is beautiful.
    <br>The Bible says, everything is beautiful at His own time.
    <br>What time are you in?
    <br>No matter the natural circumstances you are going through,
    <br>don't allow them to pressure you to doubt the love of God.
    <br>Don't allow them to press you to doubt the love of God, or misinterpret God's silence as rejection.
    <br>People of God,
    <br>sometimes it seems we work very hard without any corresponding reward for our efforts.
    <br>If you are at this moment in such a state of mind, ask Simon Peter
    <br>in the Book of Luke 5 at the seaside and he will tell you that man may work hard,
    <br>but it is the duty of God Almighty to determine the time and season of harvest.
    <br>If God gives you a vision and it seems to delay in coming, or it is opposed by men,
    <br>do not reduce your vision; stay in the will of God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, if God gives you a vision, a promise, and it seems to delay in coming,
    <br>or it is opposed by men, do not reduce your vision; stay in the will of God".
    <br>Faith must be coupled with patience to inherit the promises of God.
    <br>Remember what the Bible says, "Faith is the certainty of God's yet unfulfilled promises".
    <br>Don't give up.
    <br>Let God answer you in His own time, not yours;
    <br>in His own way, not yours; in His own agenda, not yours.
    <br>God is faithful to those who are faithful to Him.
    <br>Therefore, keep sowing.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, keep sowing in His own way,
    <br>in His own time, in His own name
    <br>and the Lord will send the harvest to your life."
    <br>I believe today is God's appointed time for you.
    <br>I believe God's appointed time has come, that is why you are here today.
    <br>Let someone say, "God's time is the best!
    <br>My enemy has made a mistake by allowing me to come here."
    <br>Today is the day that the Lord has made, I will rejoice and be glad in it.
    <br>My time has come!
    <br>You believe that?
    <br>The best is yet to come!
    <br>May God bless His Word.
