  <p>    
    <br>There is a brother there - you went to the cemetery.
    <br>Somebody took you to the cemetery and suddenly when you looked back,
    <br>the person that took you to the cemetery, you could not see the person anymore.
    <br>The person automatically disappeared.
    <br>It is still a mystery to you.
    <br>Sometimes you want to run naked.
    <br>Since that time, when you sleep in the night, you just want to go out.
    <br>Many a time you have gone out - God rescued you.
    <br>I am seeing you commit suicide this time.
    <br>That spirit is the one tormenting you - this spirit is tormenting your life.
    <br>Please, come out for prayer.
    <br>You have two children and your wife left you because of all this.
    <br>Please, come out.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>MYSTERY The Man Who Disappeared In The CEMETERY!!!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Musa Mansaray.
    <br>I am 31 years of age.
    <br>I am a Sierra Leonian.
    <br>On Sunday, the man of God gave a prophecy and said,
    <br>"A man here took you to the graveyard and the man disappeared.
    <br>Since then you behave '50/50', which is abnormally".
    <br>And I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>The man of God also said, "Your wife has left you with two kids because of that",
    <br>which I also confirm to be true.
    <br>The man of God also said, "You want to commit suicide", which I confirm to be true.
    <br>This all started while I was working on contract with the Department of Defence in Iraq.
    <br>I was working in Kirkuk in Iraq, where I experienced very hard and difficult times -
    <br>the life expectancy at the military base was just 45 minutes.
    <br>When I arrived there I realised that, according to my contract, I was not being paid a good salary,
    <br>so I started looking for other contracts at the military base.
    <br>I managed to get a new contract with another company in Iraq called KBR.
    <br>I had to resign from my former job and return to Sierra Leone, in order to go to the US Embassy,
    <br>because KBR was an American company operating from Texas.
    <br>They sent me an invitation.
    <br>On my way home after my resignation, I transited in Dubai.
    <br>As I did not have a hotel reservation, I had to wait at the airport for 8 hours for my next flight.
    <br>While I was buying sneakers in the duty free store, I met another Sierra Leone man.
    <br>We started speaking and he asked me why I was going back home.
    <br>So, I explained to him what had happened to me.
    <br>He told me that in this world you need to help yourself before God helps you.
    <br>And he said that, as a brother, he would take me somewhere to help me when we got back to Sierra Leone.
    <br>He told me that I would wash myself, then I would not struggle to get a visa from the Embassy
    <br>and when I started the new job with KBR, I would be appointed in a more senior position.
    <br>This confused me.
    <br>When we arrived in Nairobi, Kenya, I  accepted his offer.
    <br>When I was back home,
    <br>he called me in the morning and said that we should meet
    <br>and would have to drive for two hours to the site.
    <br>When we got there, I realised that he had taken me to a native doctor.
    <br>After discussing the details, I paid 200 Dollars for the ceremony.
    <br>After the ceremony, another man - who was not part of the ceremony - arrived in the evening.
    <br>The native doctor instructed me to go with this man.
    <br>He said that I must walk in front and the man would walk behind me,
    <br>and whatever the man told me to do, I should do it.
    <br>I listened to him and we left.
    <br>There was a bush behind the house with a cemetery next to it.
    <br>When we reached the cemetery, the man told me to stop.
    <br>When I stopped with the substance the native doctor gave me, the man suddenly disappeared.
    <br>When I looked, the man was no longer there.
    <br>When I got back to the native doctor, I asked him, "Can you people disappear and appear here?"
    <br>"You think it is a joke, but it is not a joke. Don't take it as a joke. Because you don't know, I will let you go".
    <br>So, I had an appointment with the US Embassy on the Monday,
    <br>which is a requirement as I was working for the Department of Defence.
    <br>When I got to the US Embassy, I was the last person the Consular assisted.
    <br>When he looked at my documents and looked at me, there seemed to be a problem.
    <br>The Consular called a colleague to also advise on my case.
    <br>They even called a third Consular to discuss my case.
    <br>They rejected my visa application and told me to leave.
    <br>As I got outside the Embassy, they called the Security and asked me to go back inside.
    <br>When I got inside, they took my documents upstairs.
    <br>After waiting 45 minutes, they still rejected my visa application.
    <br>Since then I was stressed and did not know what to do.
    <br>I took the little money that I had and went to Abu Dhabi to try and find a contract in the Middle East.
    <br>In Abu Dhabi, I was rejected again for "Blue Badge", which was one of the least work in Iraq.
    <br>When I returned home, I had no money so I convinced my mother to sell my father's house, which we did,
    <br>and I used the money to go back to Dubai to start doing business.
    <br>However, it was not going well with the business.
    <br>By then I was behaving abnormally.
    <br>When I reacted, it was so bad that I even beat my wife
    <br>and we ended up at the Police Station, and eventually separated.
    <br>At night, I would wake up and find myself outside in my underwear and then realise where I am.
    <br>I would come to my senses and go back inside.
    <br>This kept on happening to me.
    <br>By then I had a lot of debt and many creditors were looking for their money,
    <br>so I decided to leave without telling anybody where I was going.
    <br>I found myself in Abidjan, where the situation was even worse for me and the attacks continued.
    <br>One day I met a man and he asked me about the scars on my arms.
    <br>I told him that they were as a result of a sickness.
    <br>He said it wasn't a sickness but they were demonic marks.
    <br>You can see the marks on my arms.
    <br>He told me that he could not deliver me and that I should come to Nigeria, to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>MYSTERY The Man Who Disappeared In The CEMETERY!!!
    <br>Tell us what exactly did the witchdoctor do for you before you went for your appointment.
    <br>When I went there, the man was talking to the witchdoctor in their native language.
    <br>When they finished, they came back to me
    <br>and started speaking in Krio - the language which we normally speak in our country.
    <br>The man told me that he would wash me,
    <br>and then he would mark me with a substance which would enter my body.
    <br>This substance would ensure that I would be granted a visa from the Embassy,
    <br>and when I got back to the USA with KBR, I would be promoted to a more senior position within the job.
    <br>This is what the man confirmed to me.
    <br>So, they told you that you would have breakthrough after the rituals?
    <br>- Yes, exactly.
    <br>- And the ritual was that you were to be washed,
    <br>and they would give you incisions and put something inside of it?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Where are the incisions that were given to you?
    <br>It was marks like this one,
    <br>and I have another one here.
    <br>I have more on my chest.
    <br>That is what was given to me.
    <br>A man who was not part of the ceremony then took me to the cemetery.
    <br>I don't know where this man came from.
    <br>After he took me to the cemetery, he just disappeared.
    <br>When I went back to the native doctor, the man appeared again.
    <br>This is the same man Prophet TB Joshua prophesied about.
    <br>Since then things were not going well with me.
    <br>I could not succeed in anything I did and this led to frustration.
    <br>Can you recall whether you had any particular experience after this ritual?
    <br>About a week after the ritual, I had a dream.
    <br>In the dream I found myself on a very narrow road.
    <br>I met a man who was standing there and I said to him, "How are you?".
    <br>He said, "Fine'.
    <br>I said, "I want to go this way".
    <br>He said, "The only way you can go this way is if you pass through a tunnel".
    <br>The tunnel consisted of a rock.
    <br>He told me to go through the tunnel to get to the other side.
    <br>So, I went through the tunnel, but while I was in the tunnel I realised that there was no road to the other side.
    <br>So, I turned back, but the man had closed the entrance of the tunnel.
    <br>I shouted because it was dark inside the tunnel. I felt as if I was in a cage.
    <br>I then woke up.
    <br>I did not understand the things of the spirit and was not a Christian at that stage.
    <br>At SCOAN, Prophet TB Joshua prophesied to me, and I was one of the visitors that he prayed for on Monday.
    <br>I went back to the hotel that night and fell asleep.
    <br>But while I was sleeping, I realised that I was still inside the cage.
    <br>I was still crying to get out of the cage.
    <br>I then saw a big man - like a giant - ask, "Who is in that cage? Who is in that prison?".
    <br>I shouted, "It is me. Help me!".
    <br>The same man that appeared in my dream three years ago and who put me in the cage was also in my dream.
    <br>As the giant tried to open the cage, the man tried to stop him.
    <br>The giant used his own force to get rid of the man and the giant removed the rock.
    <br>Then I started seeing a light on me and the giant asked me, "Will you come up?".
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Miracle-worker, Jesus.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>He asked me, "Can you come outside?". I said, "No, sir".
    <br>So he sent a rope down for me.
    <br>I started climbing up the rope.
    <br>When I reached the surface, there was a tremendous light.
    <br>"My eyes are burning - the sun".
    <br>The man said, "Yes, because you have been in the dark for so long; that is the reason why".
    <br>MYSTERY The Man Who Disappeared In The CEMETERY!!!
    <br>I had this dream after the prophecy and the prayer from the man of God on the Monday night.
    <br>What difference have you seen in your life since this freedom that you received?
    <br>Since then, I realised that my life had been such a mess for many years.
    <br>But now, I am once again the human being that I used to be before this incident.
    <br>Since my deliverance, I have been behaving normally again and have not had any more nightmares.
    <br>MYSTERY The Man Who Disappeared In The CEMETERY!!!
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus. Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus, the mighty Deliverer!
    <br>Who else would have justly done it, if not our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>We want to further ask you, because in the course of the prophecy given to you,
    <br>the man of God said that you would just wake up naked because of this problem.
    <br>Tell us what has been your experience in regard to that since your deliverance.
    <br>The attack usually happened on Mondays and Tuesdays,
    <br>and it always happened at midnight.
    <br>I would suddenly wake up from sleeping and I would not be able to remember anything that had happened.
    <br>I would just wake up in the street, only wearing my underwear, and say, "What am I doing here?".
    <br>I would then run home.
    <br>That was the worst thing that has happened in my life.
    <br>I thought that I was going mad when I found myself in the street.
    <br>That happened on Sunday afternoon.
    <br>I went to eat out with my friends, and that is when the attack happened on the Sunday.
    <br>I thought that I was going mad that day.
    <br>I got up from the store and started walking.
    <br>My friends asked me, "Are you mad or what? Do you have some devil in you?"
    <br>I told them that there was nothing wrong with me.
    <br>So this is what I noticed.
    <br>I also realised that since the ceremony with the native doctor, there was always an odour - a very bad scent.
    <br>Even if I used a lot of perfume, the bad odour would remain on my skin.
    <br>Sometimes I even smelt it in my house as well.
    <br>But since my deliverance, I have not sensed it again.
    <br>MYSTERY The Man Who Disappeared In The CEMETERY!!!
    <br>I have not experienced the bad odour again since my deliverance.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>As a young man, I have advice for all the young men here in The SCOAN.
    <br>I believe that this is the best way for you to live your life.
    <br>Be careful of friends that you meet outside that you want to be friends with.
    <br>You may think that they want to help you, but it may destroy your life.
    <br>The best way is Jesus.
    <br>I never knew that there was a Man who came to save and help people, until I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Now I know His name is Jesus and He wants to help people.
    <br>MYSTERY The Man Who Disappeared In The CEMETERY!!!
    <br>We thank God for your word of advice,
    <br>that people should be careful of good-intentioned people who give advice from a human point of view,
    <br>and bring destruction into the life of people.
    <br>And you want to encourage them to trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Because if you trust in Him, you will never be confounded in time or eternity.
    <br>We thank God for your life
    <br>and we want to encourage you that now that the Lord has given you this freedom,
    <br>has delivered you and set you free from this oppression of an evil spirit,
    <br>we want you to make His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>And we pray that God Almighty will grant you the inner grace to do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
