    <br>WHAT IS GOD SAYING ABOUT 'CORONAVIRUS'?!?
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Good Morning, viewers all over the world, and welcome to the new Emmanuel TV Studios!
    <br>Good Morning, viewers!
    <br>Yes, I know many of you may be wondering where we are right now
    <br>but don't be surprised that we are broadcasting to you
    <br>live right here in Ikotun-Egbe in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>There are many things we don't know about this ministry
    <br>because what we know, we destroy.
    <br>This is why God continues to use surprises.
    <br>God surprises us with a new thing every day,
    <br>whether it is in the administration part of the ministry or in the supernatural.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>We are here today in the studio to discuss the happenings around the world.
    <br>Don't forget: We are a team!
    <br>So any moment from now, we are expecting Prophet T.B. Joshua to be in our midst,
    <br>here in the studio to address theses issues.
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, we want you to put a phone call through to your friends, colleagues, neighbours,
    <br>encourage people to tune in to Emmanuel TV right now
    <br>to hear the message that God has given the Prophet for such a time as this.
    <br>For such a time as this indeed.
    <br>We are living in perilous times -
    <br>a time when if you look around at the situation in the world,
    <br>if you look at your new daily routines, you may even refer to yourselves as refugees!
    <br>What do I mean by a refugee?
    <br>A refugee is someone who cannot exercise their own free will.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Today, many cannot even give a handshake to their relatives, like this.
    <br>No! We are like this now.
    <br>That's what is happening in the world right now.
    <br>Even just to gather together - they can't.
    <br>They can't even go to restaurants, theatres.
    <br>They cannot travel from one country to another.
    <br>Now, in this time that we are in, just a cough, a normal thing, is now a crime.
    <br>If any of you cough in this studio today, we will put you in quarantine.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Many cannot exercise their free will.
    <br>This is why we use the term 'refugees'.
    <br>I believe that this time will help us to reason with the many thousands and millions of refugees
    <br>suffering around the world today.
    <br>We all have watched what happened to the refugees in Syria, Turkey, in Greece.
    <br>They are not able to exercise their free will
    <br>because of a conflict in one part of the world or another.
    <br>They are there right now, in the hundreds of thousands.
    <br>Yes. Right now, little children are with their mothers beside the border at the seaside, day and night.
    <br>It really is a cause for reflection.
    <br>Viewers, think about this.
    <br>Perhaps, what we are facing now is because of what we have done to the refugees.
    <br>Who knows, maybe what we are facing now is the backlash.
    <br>Yeah, you may be right.
    <br>I mean, look at the situation we are in today - fear everywhere.
    <br>Fear of this, fear of that, fear of the Coronavirus.
    <br>It seems as if everyone today is afflicted with this fear.
    <br>This has brought about so much confusion - all over the world - confusion.
    <br>And that's why we are here today, to address these important issues.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we are a team!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua will be out shortly to address us and the situation we are in.
    <br>Today fear has overwhelmed, overshadowed even the coronavirus itself.
    <br>The question is: Why did this fear suddenly come with this coronavirus?
    <br>Let's hear what the Bible says about it in the Book of Isaiah 41:10 - I read:
    <br>"Fear not, for I am with you;
    <br>Be not be dismayed, for I am your God.
    <br>I will strengthen you. Yes, I will help you,
    <br>I will uphold you with my righteous right hand," says the Lord.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>It reminds me of another wonderful Scripture: 2 Timothy 1:7.
    <br>Viewers, I'd encourage you to open your Bible right now, turn there with us.
    <br>2 Timothy 1:7 and it reads thus:
    <br>"For God has not given us a spirit of fear,
    <br>but of power and of love and of a sound mind."
    <br>So, do not be afraid!
    <br>This reminds me of the instruction that Isaiah gave us in the Book of Isaiah.
    <br>If we turn back to Isaiah 35:4, and it reads:
    <br>Tell everyone who is discouraged,
    <br>right now, tell everyone who is fearful:
    <br>Do not be afraid; be strong for God will come to rescue you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>What is Isaiah saying here?
    <br>Isaiah is telling us:
    <br>Do not allow the coronavirus or its fear to destroy our relationships.
    <br>What is fear?
    <br>Fear simply means we are not in line with God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Today many relationships are under threat because of fear of this coronavirus.
    <br>Just a cough is a crime.
    <br>Just a fever is seen like a coronavirus.
    <br>It is very true.
    <br>How would we define this coronavirus?
    <br>Now the coronavirus is the devil
    <br>that has come to destroy our relationship, our fellowship between God and man.
    <br>This is its intention - to make us run away from God and also run away from people.
    <br>OK, in society today, you just meet someone, you want to greet them,
    <br>- "How are you?"
    <br>- "Oh, not today."
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>This was not the situation before the coronavirus and its fear came.
    <br>Let's ask the viewers: Viewers, look around where you are right now.
    <br>Are you in a gathering? 
    <br>Probably not.
    <br>When was the last time you went out to a restaurant?
    <br>Have you been to a wedding, a birthday party, a gathering or fellowship? No.
    <br>This is what the coronavirus and fear have brought to us today.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They are destroying our relationship and fellowship.
    <br>Viewers, we should not forget that where this coronavirus started, that is Wuhan, China,
    <br>right now they have confirmed that there were no new cases of coronavirus there.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>This simply means that the coronavirus is fading away.
    <br>We want to show you the news clip right now to confirm
    <br>what the health officials in China have said concerning this.
    <br>Just join us and watch this news clip right now.
    <br>A major milestone in China's battle against the coronavirus.
    <br>For the first time no new cases had been reported in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.
    <br>The city battled thousands of new infections daily at the peak of the crisis
    <br>but medical teams who were deployed from across the country are now returning home.
    <br>Chinese scientists and health experts believe the worst is over.
    <br>We are very delighted to see this double-zero increase.
    <br>This means today we have seen the dawn after so many days of hard efforts.
    <br>It also means our control measures and medical treatment methods have been working very well.
    <br>China reached a key milestone in the battle against COVID-19 in Wuhan
    <br>with no new cases reported on Wednesday and Thursday.
    <br>It marks a notable first in the city's months-long battle with the deadly virus.
    <br>Local residents are overjoyed with the news, with many expressing gratitude to
    <br>medical workers from other provinces.
    <br>Wuhan residents have supported the government's resolution in fighting the epidemic.
    <br>They also appreciate all the support from other parts of the country.
    <br>Another thing I noticed is that residents have a strong desire to go outside, including to return to work.
    <br>On Thursday, Wuhan announced that grocery shops, pharmacies and food markets
    <br>in infection-free communities will be allowed to reopen.
    <br>Over the past month over 40 000 medical workers from across the country
    <br>have come to Hubei and Wuhan to help fight the coronavirus epidemic.
    <br>Today they are going home.
    <br>This medical team from Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region came to Wuhan
    <br>when coronavirus infection rampaged this epicentre.
    <br>They are now returning to their homes 2,000 kilometres away.
    <br>Have a safe trip.
    <br>Welcome to Wuhan next time.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Today the first batch of over 3,700 doctors and nurses are returning home.
    <br>Salute to you.
    <br>Thank you Ningxia.
    <br>Salute to you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Safe trip.
    <br>Goodbye.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you for your efforts.
    <br>Farewell.
    <br>You are most welcome to come back again.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Fellow medical workers from Ningxia, good afternoon.
    <br>You are the last team to board the plane.
    <br>Thank you for your hard work.
    <br>You are going home a hero.
    <br>Have a safe flight.
    <br>Thank you all.
    <br>I wish you all good health.
    <br>WHAT IS GOD SAYING ABOUT 'CORONAVIRUS'?!?
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Over 40,000 doctors and nurses across China have been dispatched to Wuhan since the outbreak.
    <br>Wuhan reported over 1,000 daily new infections when they arrived.
    <br>On the day they left, the city reported only one coronavirus case.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>You've heard for yourself, viewers.
    <br>The China health officials have confirmed there are no new cases of coronavirus in Wuhan, China.
    <br>That's the epicentre of the outbreak.
    <br>Not only that; all the temporary hospitals they built to accommodate the victims have shut down,
    <br>the 40,000 medical professionals that came from across China to assist with the outbreak
    <br>have gone home because they have no new patients to attend to
    <br>and life is returning to normal there.
    <br>And we thank God for life returning to normal.
    <br>Viewers, I think it's good that we give you a clear description, vivid explanation
    <br>of what's happening around the world.
    <br>So, while we wait for Prophet T.B. Joshua to come to the studio,
    <br>let's go over to our screen and let's take a look at what's happening in the world.
    <br>This is our world today; the smoke is everywhere.
    <br>But what is the cause of this smoke?
    <br>Fire.
    <br>This is the fire.
    <br>It represents and symbolises the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China.
    <br>But as you have just heard, there are no new cases of the coronavirus here.
    <br>This means the fire is out but the smoke continues to rise.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because even when you extinguish a fire, the smoke will spread across the environment.
    <br>There is no way fire will burn without smoke.
    <br>It is just the smoke we are seeing in the Western world and parts of Africa.
    <br>And that should not be an issue, because the issue here was Wuhan,
    <br>that's where it all started and they have overcome it.
    <br>They have overcome, meaning the affliction is over.
    <br>So if the affliction is over...
    <br>This is the fire - it symbolises affliction.
    <br>The smoke symbolises the afflicted.
    <br>Once the affliction is gone, what is the afflicted?
    <br>It is just smoke, a remnant, a memory, history.
    <br>And this is what we see spreading across our world today - a memory.
    <br>Now is the decision to say, "I am healed! I am delivered! I am free!"
    <br>This is just the decision we need!
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>I want to give you another example as well, to illustrate this.
    <br>Viewers, just imagine you are walking along the road and somewhere nearby there has been a fire
    <br>and you smell, you perceive the odour of the smoke.
    <br>Let me ask you this question:
    <br>Will that odour, smell remain permanently on your body?
    <br>Of course not.
    <br>No.
    <br>You, that just perceived the odour of the smoke,
    <br>can you compare yourself to someone who is actually caught in the midst of the fire, in the flames?
    <br>No.
    <br>Ask yourself this question:
    <br>Why would anyone now want to live with that smell, odour and even die with it?
    <br>Why should that become a thing to be celebrated?
    <br>Because of fear.
    <br>Yes. If we are honest and sincere with ourselves,
    <br>every sickness can be deadly, irrespective of its nature.
    <br>Think back about all the people we have lost over the years.
    <br>A headache - a common headache - can kill.
    <br>In the same way, this coronavirus can kill.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>One thing we must know -
    <br>there is no medicine for fear, just as there is no medicine for poverty.
    <br>When you are fearful, doctors cannot diagnose you.
    <br>Since Wuhan has overcome it, the coronavirus is no longer an issue.
    <br>Now, the issue is fear!
    <br>Exactly, that's the issue - fear; this is what satan is using to afflict us today.
    <br>So viewers, what are we talking about?
    <br>Why are we so easily afflicted with this fear?
    <br>Why do we now celebrate this affliction?
    <br>You have heard it, you have seen it today:
    <br>Coronavirus is no longer an issue; it is a thing of the past!
    <br>Right now, you have to say, "No" to fear.
    <br>Yes, let us say, "No" to fear.
    <br>You afflicted - cheer up and let us get over the coronavirus and its fear.
    <br>As Jesus said, "In this world you will have tribulation."
    <br>What is the coronavirus if not a tribulation?
    <br>Cheer up! Jesus has overcome the world!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Viewers, right now I want you to declare this,
    <br>I want you to speak this boldly, wherever you are watching us right now.
    <br>This is the time for you to get up to awaken wherever you are watching this right now,
    <br>say this authoritatively with all your heart.
    <br>Say it with us at home right now:
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>I am free!
    <br>I am blessed!
    <br>I am delivered!
    <br>Fear of the coronavirus is a thing of the past!
    <br>It's over, viewers all over the world!
    <br>You just say this, confess this with all of your heart, in Jesus' name.
    <br>It is time for you to awaken!
    <br>Awake and be free from the fear of this coronavirus
    <br>so your government will have time to face the challenges ahead of them.
    <br>There are issues after the coronavirus is over -
    <br>issues of economic backlash which the coronavirus has caused.
    <br>This is the issue of the day.
    <br>And let us be clear:
    <br>It is not only the responsibility of our government;
    <br>we have a role to play in our economy.
    <br>Let us get well and get free from the coronavirus and its fear
    <br>so that we can join the government to face this economic backlash
    <br>because our government needs our support.
    <br>You cannot be sick and support the government.
    <br>A sick person is not a supporter; rather, we support them.
    <br>I mean, a fearful person is not a supporter; rather, we support them.
    <br>In other words what we are saying is that:
    <br>Government moves when we move and vice versa.
    <br>Government stops when we stop.
    <br>Government is sick when we are sick.
    <br>The government is the government of the people, not of sickness, affliction or fear.
    <br>Let us co-operate with the government.
    <br>All they are trying to do is see that we are protected.
    <br>If we are still sick and fearful, the government cannot move forward
    <br>because we are the government and the government is us.
    <br>Get up! Wake up! And let us face the economic challenges -
    <br>the outcome of this coronavirus.
    <br>Remember, the wound of us is the wound of the government.
    <br>The peace of the government is the peace of us.
    <br>Remember - the definition of democracy:
    <br>Democracy is the government of the people, by the people, for the people,
    <br>not the government of sickness and fear.
    <br>So viewers all over the world, be encouraged, take heart, don't be afraid.
    <br>We repeat once again:
    <br>The coronavirus is no longer an issue; it's a thing of the past!
    <br>Right now I want you to fix your heart on the promise of God.
    <br>Turn with me to the Book of John 14:27 and let us hear what our Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>is proclaiming over you in this perilous time.
    <br>John 14:27.
    <br>Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you;
    <br>not as the world gives do I give to you.
    <br>Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
    <br>Once again viewers, do not be afraid.
    <br>And do not forget, we are a team.
    <br>Any moment from now Prophet T.B. Joshua will come into our midst
    <br>to pray with you and address this issue at hand.
    <br>Thank you for joining us and stay tuned, as we continue coming to you live and direct
    <br>from the new Emmanuel TV studio in Lagos Nigeria.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>WHAT IS GOD SAYING ABOUT 'CORONAVIRUS'?!? | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Viewers, welcome back.
    <br>Thank you for staying with us!
    <br>During the break, we had the opportunity to select a few of the thousands of emails that have come in
    <br>asking Prophet T.B. Joshua questions about this present situation.
    <br>We are waiting the arrival of Prophet T.B. Joshua any moment from now
    <br>and by God's grace we will be able to ask him a few of these viewer questions.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>You are welcome, sir.
    <br>I pray you are such in heart.
    <br>Good Morning, sir.
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>Welcome, sir. Please have a seat.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>Discussion With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>At The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>We have received thousands of emails from our viewers around the world
    <br>asking questions about this present situation and we would like to read a few of them to you.
    <br>OK.
    <br>We will start with this email - it really expresses the mind of everyone.
    <br>It reads:
    <br>Dear Synagogue, I want to know why our Prophet supported the government
    <br>to ban gatherings in churches.
    <br>Where does T.B. Joshua want us to worship?
    <br>We are bona fide members of The SCOAN and we have nowhere to go. Kind regards.
    <br>Well, you have so many emails.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Well, I think, I am in line with God.
    <br>It was a vision I saw sometime last year - in April, February and even January of this year.
    <br>We have the record there.
    <br>Actions speak louder.
    <br>I think they can play it and let us hear.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>PROPHECY! PROPHECY! PROPHECY!
    <br>WHEN GOD'S SERVANT SPEAKS FORTH
    <br>THE WISE LISTEN
    <br>DEUTERONOMY 18:22
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On Sunday, 24th of February 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message
    <br>about a vision God had given him concerning The SCOAN service.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>The thing God is still telling me -
    <br>you will just get here one day, you will learn that there is no church.
    <br>Please, meet me on Emmanuel TV - no church.
    <br>So, you'll meet me on Emmanuel TV talking to you,
    <br>or when there is a revival, you'll see me.
    <br>So, we have to be serious.
    <br>On Sunday, 7th April 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied further
    <br>about the vision he had seen regarding the church service at The SCOAN.
    <br>This is what he said.
    <br>You know, I told you people of recent:
    <br>You may be here, you'll learn that there is no service - close the church.
    <br>You meet us on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Now, we are in a perilous time - a very difficult time.
    <br>Hear what is happening all over the world.
    <br>Fearful year!
    <br>A lot happened and our protection is God.
    <br>On Sunday, 5th January 2020, for the third time,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua once again prophesied about what he saw would happen this year
    <br>concerning The SCOAN service.
    <br>This is what he said.
    <br>I'm so concerned about what is going to happen this year -
    <br>so much concerned than anything.
    <br>It is going to cause me to close the church and find out what is going to happen -
    <br>because everywhere is fear.
    <br>If something wants to catch you, it should not catch you unprepared.
    <br>You don't mind but I am very, very concerned.
    <br>Viewers, you have seen the prophetic message since last year.
    <br>Where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>Since last year, I have been on my knees, praying to God to see us through
    <br>but the issue is unchangeable.
    <br>It is just like that.
    <br>I am walking by vision and a mission.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Thank you for your time, sir.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Perhaps it is the time for us to leave you now, so you can address the viewers.
    <br>That is wonderful because I want to talk to my family all over the world.
    <br>I want to talk to them.
    <br>I just want them to know my position, the reason why we have this issue at hand.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Lest I forget, I have not given you a handshake!
    <br>Today? No, sir.
    <br>It's like this!
    <br>What a 'monster'!
    <br>You mean what?
    <br>Sorry sir, today...
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>Does it mean satan is trying to destroy our relationship with God?
    <br>What is he trying to do?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>See you.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>You have seen, viewers, satan is trying to destroy the relationship between God and man.
    <br>This is what you have seen happen.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>This is an opportunity to talk to you.
    <br>FEAR IS MORE DECEPTIVE
    <br>You have seen what happened and what is happening.
    <br>But thank God, God always prepares us for whatever life brings
    <br>because our walking with the Lord has to do with both good and hard times -
    <br>when the goings are good and when the goings are tough - just as we are seeing now.
    <br>When there is money in the pocket, when there is no money in the pocket,
    <br>when there is food on the table, when there is no food on the table,
    <br>God always prepares us.
    <br>Viewers, we are in the end time,
    <br>marked by manifestation of the spirit of fear.
    <br>End time -
    <br>fear of this, fear of that, fear of affliction, fear of failure.
    <br>You have seen what happened when I was giving a handshake.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Address 
    <br>At The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Having fear is not wrong;
    <br>it is when we harbour and entertain it that it becomes an issue, a problem.
    <br>Through fear, satan brainwashes us.
    <br>See what is happening -
    <br>see what is happening all over the world!
    <br>This is the work of satan.
    <br>He comes to steal, kill and destroy.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Address 
    <br>At The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>When we begin to fear, we are giving place to the devil.
    <br>What we are afraid of may eventually happen to us.
    <br>Fear failure - and likely you will fail.
    <br>Viewers, fear affliction e.g., coronavirus - and you will likely be afflicted.
    <br>This is a monster.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of 2 Timothy 1:7.
    <br>"For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind."
    <br>Take your time, go to the Book of Isaiah 41:10.
    <br>There is power in fear - power to torment, power to snare our souls,
    <br>power to paralyse our potential.
    <br>There is no limit you cannot go.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, right now begin to ask God to open the eyes of your faith
    <br>so that you can see those who are with you, supporting you, fighting for you
    <br>are more than the forces of your adversary.
    <br>I want to share with you some of my habits before prayer
    <br>and I want you to cultivate that habit.
    <br>Before you pray - appreciation.
    <br>Appreciate where you are coming from - yesterday - what the Lord has done
    <br>in the past and what He is able to do.
    <br>He is able, more than able!
    <br>Never a sickness He cannot cure.
    <br>Never a disease, affliction He cannot heal.
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Appreciate what He has done in the past and what He is able to do right now.
    <br>Appreciate!
    <br>Don't forget you were once a tiny embryo; today see what you have become -
    <br>moving freely, laughing freely, looking freely.
    <br>If you don't know...
    <br>You need to appreciate the awesome God.
    <br>You were once unsaved, but today you are saved.
    <br>I was once a rustic boy but today see what I have become.
    <br>Appreciation.
    <br>Are you talking of sickness?
    <br>I was once sick but today I am healthy.
    <br>Many of us were once barren but today we are fruitful.
    <br>Appreciation before prayer.
    <br>Viewers, whenever you are facing difficult situations,
    <br>such as we are today all over the world,
    <br>in which it seems there is no future, no way forward, just as we are today,
    <br>you should learn to use the weapon of your testimony and confession.
    <br>"I was sick, I am healed."
    <br>"I was a rustic guy; today see what I am."
    <br>"I was unsaved but today I'm saved."
    <br>Your weapon of testimony and confession of what He has done in the past
    <br>and what He is able to do right now, in the face of your circumstances.
    <br>My habit imparts a strength to endure my present challenges, circumstances.
    <br>This will impart to you - to endure your present difficulty.
    <br>This will give you strength to face the situation at hand.
    <br>Viewers, right now begin to plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear -
    <br>fear of cancer, fear of virus, fear of coronavirus, fear of affliction, fear of disappointment -
    <br>fear of this, fear of that.
    <br>Begin to plead the Blood of Jesus against every fear.
    <br>Resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I want you to know I am not alone here.
    <br>You need to see those who are supporting me,
    <br>those who are supporting my position
    <br>and those who are fighting for me - those who are with us here.
    <br>I command you to begin to resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen:
    <br>I'm not alone here!
    <br>Begin to resist fear, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>All circumstances can lead us to You, Lord.
    <br>Your children need Your healing hand.
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Never a sickness You cannon heal.
    <br>Never a problem You cannot solve.
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The right hand of God is power!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Restore them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Bless them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Those on the sickbed - Lord Jesus, guide the medical practitioners,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Guide the medical practitioners, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Guide the medical practitioners who will work on them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Use them to restore their health, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Lord Jesus, guide the surgeon's hand!
    <br>May their bodies respond quickly to treatment, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>May their bodies respond to treatment, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Guide the surgeon's hand.
    <br>May their bodies respond quickly to treatment, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Father, thank You, Lord!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, this prayer is not time-bound.
    <br>I mean, it is not bound by time.
    <br>Anytime you hear it, the presence of God is maintained.
    <br>I want to leave you in faith.
    <br>I'm expecting to meet you in faith, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you.
