    <br>QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>QUESTION – Prophet TB Joshua, what shall we call this period we are in -
    <br>where you cannot give your neighbour a handshake, you cannot cough in public,
    <br>travel to Jerusalem or Mecca for pilgrimage has been prohibited,
    <br>people no longer share the Holy Communion cup, Pope Francis is performing Mass through video,
    <br>many churches are holding services online, universities such as Harvard have closed,
    <br>in many countries there are no gatherings of people more than ten
    <br>and even President Trump said the situation is “not under control”.
    <br>WHAT CAN YOU SAY?
    <br>ANSWER – Don’t forget what Jesus said to His disciples,
    <br>to Simon Peter in Luke 22:32 – “I pray your faith will not fail.” It is a prophetic word.
    <br>Jesus was prophesying about what was to come – a time like this.
    <br>He knew something was coming that would challenge our faith, that would take the faith from many,
    <br>that would stop people from worshipping. 
    <br>But I don’t see anything to panic about because Jesus said in John 16:33 -
    <br>“In this world, you will have tribulation – but cheer up; I have overcome the world.”
    <br>Don’t forget what I said at the beginning of the year – “Work of God –
    <br>people will be getting tired this year because the work of God is not by power and might;
    <br>because of so many challenges, tribulations and burdens they will not be able to bear.”
    <br>Real faith thrives on a test. If there was nothing serious in the past to test our faith,
    <br>here is something to test our faith in a unique way – a real situation.
    <br>What an opportunity to grow in faith, in our relationship with God!
    <br>What can separate us from the love of God (Romans 8:38-39)? Can the coronavirus? Can death? Nothing!
    <br>As 1 Corinthians 10:13 says, He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear.
    <br>TB JOSHUA ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON CORONAVIRUS!!!
    <br>QUESTION – You said the voice of the coronavirus will be silenced by the end of this month
    <br>but President Trump said it may linger until July or August.
    <br>For re-emphasis, we want to hear from you again because there is so much fear and panic. 
    <br>ANSWER – I say again – it is the remnants we are seeing. The real coronavirus is gone.
    <br>What we are seeing now are the remnants.
    <br>But what the coronavirus has caused – economic backlash, fear – will linger until the end of the year.
    <br>TB JOSHUA ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON CORONAVIRUS!!!
    <br>QUESTION – How do we overcome fear?
    <br>ANSWER – What is fear? How do you define fear?
    <br>Fear means you are not in line with God, you are not with God.
    <br>Fear exposes the level of our relationship with God.
    <br>Fear exposes the kind of relationship we have with our Creator – God.
    <br>Fear exposes who we serve, who we believe.
    <br>Fear means we are not serving God with all our hearts. Fear means we are not such in heart.
    <br>The opening of the eyes of our faith will be the silencing of our fears.
    <br>TB JOSHUA ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON CORONAVIRUS!!!
    <br>QUESTION – What are we to expect at the end of this month?
    <br>ANSWER – I have said it! How many times do you want me to say it?
    <br>How many times do you want to hear it?
    <br>TB JOSHUA ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON CORONAVIRUS!!!
    <br>QUESTION – But are we to continue with the coronavirus?
    <br>ANSWER – The name of God has always been used for possible things – but faith is for impossible things.
    <br>We are using God’s name for possible things, not impossible.
    <br>People’s lives have been like this. This coronavirus has only exposed us.
    <br>Our challenges determine where we are spiritually.
    <br>Challenges reveal the true condition of man’s heart.
    <br>Challenges reveal where we belong.
    <br>Remember, faith is for impossible things.
    <br>TB JOSHUA ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON CORONAVIRUS!!!
    <br>QUESTION – If I may be clear, you said the voice of coronavirus will be silenced by the end of this month. Are we right?
    <br>ANSWER – Well, I will not blame you, because you live by what you see and what you hear.
    <br>I am telling you what is to come.
    <br>Thank God you cannot change it, because people are profiting from the situation at hand.
