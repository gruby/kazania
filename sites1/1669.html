  <p>    
    <br>Man of God, my name is Keamogeste Oodira from Botswana.
    <br>I have a problem of eating raw, uncooked meat for 19 years.
    <br>I stared eating raw, uncooked meat when I was ten years old,
    <br>when I saw someone who was addicted to eating this meat eat it.
    <br>Since then, I have been eating this meat.
    <br>I prefer it when it is raw - it tastes good.
    <br>And most of the time I crave the smell of the blood and the blood that is in the meat -
    <br>that's when I take it and eat it.
    <br>Please, Man of God, deliver me!
    <br>Here is a plate of raw chicken, raw meat and raw liver,
    <br>all still dripping blood and this lady begins to devour them all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This, right here, is raw ox liver. It is the one that I enjoy most.
    <br>You mean, as you are eating it now, you are enjoying it?
    <br>Yes, it tastes really good; it tastes creamy, like chocolate.
    <br>This is beef.
    <br>Addicted To Eating Raw Meat
    <br>The beef has a really good smell.
    <br>Addicted To Eating Raw Meat
    <br>I enjoy and crave the blood; it tastes really good and smells good.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Addicted To Eating Raw Meat
    <br>This is a chicken; I also eat raw, uncooked chicken.
    <br>I prefer it like this; it tastes better when it is uncooked.
    <br>Addicted To Eating Raw Meat
    <br>This is the raw chicken.
    <br>Addicted To Eating Raw Meat
    <br>This one - it tastes so sweet.
    <br>Addicted To Eating Raw Meat
    <br>Please, Man of God, deliver me!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You evil spirit behind this addiction, get out of her right now!
    <br>Come out right now, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Whatever you have deposited in her - out!
    <br>The light of God exposes the darkness in her life.
    <br>Speak, in Jesus' name. What have you done to this lady?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "No progress".
    <br>What are the things you pushed her to be eating?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Raw meat".
    <br>How do you use it to destroy her?
    <br>The evil spirit say, "No marriage, stagnation, setback and limitation".
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Through her ancestors".
    <br>Ok, you demon of destruction that wants her to be taking this raw blood,
    <br>right now, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, your time has expired in this body!
    <br>Right now, you must leave with this wicked addiction to raw meat.
    <br>Get out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come out of her!
    <br>Whatever you deposited in her body - come out!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Ok sister, rise to your feet.
    <br>You are completely delivered ...
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>... from this strange addiction.
    <br>For the glory of God, to show that that evil spirit has left you,
    <br>I want you to try this thing once again and see the reaction
    <br>because truly are delivered, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Attempting to eat the raw liver like she used to, Oodira is disgusted by the taste and she immediately spits it out.
    <br>Jesus Christ has indeed set her free.
    <br>How does it smell?
    <br>It smells horrible.
    <br>How does it taste?
    <br>It tastes bitter.
    <br>The raw meat that was once her delicacy now tastes bitter in her mouth.
    <br>Only Jesus Christ could have brought about this transformation.
    <br>All glory to God!

    <br>It tastes really good.
    <br>Before, when it was cooked, it tasted horrible.
    <br>But now you are eating the cooked food.
    <br>What does it taste like?
    <br>Tell us again.
    <br>It tastes delicious.
    <br>The devil has lost.
    <br>I am delivered, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Delivered From Addiction To Eating Raw Meat In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Keamogeste Oodira.
    <br>I am from Botswana.
    <br>I am 29 years old.
    <br>I want to give glory to God for delivering me from an addiction to eating raw meat.
    <br>It all started when I was 10 years old.
    <br>We were in the kitchen when a close family member came and took a big slice of uncooked meat.
    <br>He ate it and when he ate it, he looked at me in the eyes and said, "This is how we do it."
    <br>Immediately, I got the urge to eat this raw meat.
    <br>So, I started to eat it.
    <br>I ate it and whenever my parents would send me to the shops
    <br>sometimes they would tell me to buy meat for 20 Pulas.
    <br>I would bring only meat for 5 Pulas because I had eaten it on the way.
    <br>My parents would argue and say, "Why did you bring only such small portion of meat?"
    <br>But they did not know that I would steal and eat it.
    <br>It continued since then.
    <br>It affected my life from primary school onwards.
    <br>One day, when our friend introduced us to Emmanuel TV,
    <br>I saw people eating soil and other things that were not good.
    <br>I said, "This is not normal. I have to go to The SCOAN to get my deliverance."
    <br>Whenever I ate this meat, I felt something like a snake moving in my stomach.
    <br>If I didn't eat it, I felt so angry.
    <br>It went on like this, until I decided to come to The SCOAN to seek God's intervention.
    <br>It affected my life spiritually and I started to have a spiritual husband.
    <br>I had setback in my education and limitation with disappointments.
    <br>But whenever I ate raw meat, it tasted so sweet and good.
    <br>It was so creamy - like a chocolate.
    <br>There was a time when I tried to stop by myself.
    <br>Whenever I tried to stop by myself, I would have dreams;
    <br>I would be eating this raw meat with chopsticks, with dripping blood.
    <br>Sometimes I would be eating it in the dreams like an animal.
    <br>I could not stop it by myself.
    <br>That's when I decided to seek God's intervention.
    <br>Tell us what happened when you visited The SCOAN;
    <br>how you received your deliverance.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, I felt like something was coming out of my body.
    <br>After my deliverance, when I tasted this raw meat, it tasted bitter, and it smelled really bad.
    <br>So, I give glory to God for my deliverance.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>For the very first time, after 19 years of eating this raw meat when it tasted and smelled good -
    <br>now it tasted bitter and it smelled really bad - horrible.
    <br>I could not eat it anymore.
    <br>That Sunday night I had a dream that I had a swollen stomach.
    <br>All of a sudden, the thing that was moving in my stomach was so aggressive.
    <br>I woke up at 4 am.
    <br>I rushed to the bathroom.
    <br>When I rushed to the bathroom, something very watery and smelly came out of me.
    <br>It was the first time it has ever happened in my life.
    <br>Since then, this feeling of a snake moving up and down stopped.
    <br>The urge that I would have to eat this raw meat - it stopped.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Before that, cooked meat was tasteless to me.
    <br>When I was eating it, I did not want people to notice that I did not like it. I would add a lot of pepper to give it flavour.
    <br>But now to my amazement, when I eat it, I don't even have to add pepper. It tastes delicious.
    <br>And I thank God!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Viewers all over the world, stop eating strange things.
    <br>Stop eating things that are not normal.
    <br>It was after my deliverance I realised that the evil spirit was the cause of me eating the raw meat.
    <br>Stop eating anything that is not normal, because that is what the devil is using to destroy our lives.
    <br>Seek God's intervention.
    <br>We know that with God Almighty all things are possible,
    <br>and when we seek Him and trust in Him, He will definitely do what He has promised to do.
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went, I went
    <br>When He went, we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
