  <p>    
    <br>Be a good reporter - first to God and then to your fellow men.
    <br>I think I need to emphasise on this.
    <br>The world is coming to an end.
    <br>You need a weapon.
    <br>Can we talk about change for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>We have not seen so much change.
    <br>There is no evidence, not much evidence.
    <br>Christianity today is fading.
    <br>We are religious people, not Christians.
    <br>Religious everywhere.
    <br>You say, we are Christians. Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>This is giving me so much concern.
    <br>If Jesus comes today, what would be your response?
    <br>This weapon of reporting - work as well as report.
    <br>Let us go to the Book of Psalms 12:2.
    <br>"Everyone lies to their neighbour; they flatter with their lips but harbour deception in their hearts."
    <br>This means you say, "Yes" but in your heart it's "No".
    <br>That is what the Bible is saying here.
    <br>This is what I said about the confession.
    <br>You will say, "Yes" but in your heart it's "No".
    <br>You say, "Be blessed" but in your heart, "Be cursed".
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>This is what is happening all over the world today.
    <br>You think this man is your friend but in his heart, he is your enemy.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>So where are we going? You mean, you are not saved.
    <br>We are not saved.
    <br>The world is coming to an end.
    <br>You suddenly learn that your child that you so much trust -
    <br>you suddenly learn a different story that it is this, it is that. Ah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A lot is going on around us - every minute.
    <br>As you see the work of God going on, also you see people around you.
    <br>Many of them are doing a different thing.
    <br>You will be very surprised that "Ah, in the church where these wonderful things are happening!"
    <br>"What?"
    <br>"Beggar inside the church - what!"
    <br>A note sent to you - "I'm having a party tomorrow, let us meet."
    <br>"Ah!"
    <br>You see a brother busy with the handset.
    <br>When you peep to see, it is a game he is playing - inside the church!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will be very surprised when you hear some ringtones -
    <br>the music there is a wordly one.
    <br>Someone would say, "Give me your phone number" inside the church
    <br>You may be very surprised; will I give or not?
    <br>By the time you are giving this number, you may be very surprised at the call you will receive.
    <br>So, where are we going?
    <br>A friend by confession but enemy in the heart.
    <br>A lot is going on around us every minute that needs to be reported
    <br>to help the establishment's growth.
    <br>This is what the Book of Psalms says: everyone lies.
    <br>Whom can we believe?
    <br>Whom can we believe now?
    <br>Being a good reporter, people will beam a satellite on you.
    <br>That is why people are afraid to report.
    <br>People will beam their satellite on you, which is good
    <br>because this will make you to be very conscious of whatever you say and whatever you do.
    <br>This is the only way you can change.
    <br>Whatever you do, if any other does that, they would not bother but you -
    <br>you do it, they will report you; they will say it, they will talk.
    <br>You would be very conscious of whatever you do, whatever you say.
    <br>It is good to be conscious.
    <br>Look at me here now.
    <br>I can't just say anything, anyhow
    <br>because I know, what I'm saying now, millions of people are watching.
    <br>And those watching, they will transfer it to every side.
    <br>I have to be very careful.
    <br>So therefore, I can't go to a party.
    <br>If I went to a party, they would want to take pictures of me.
    <br>If I talked to any sister, they would say, "No, something is going on!"
    <br>If I were talking to a smoker - "Ay, he is a smoker!"
    <br>People will beam a satellite on you
    <br>and that will help you to be very conscious of whatever you do or say.
    <br>It is good.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be a good reporter".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Be a good reporter.]
    <br>This is the best weapon for you to change.
    <br>Be ready to relate with people that can report you.
    <br>You are because I am; I am because you are.
    <br>Where I am weak, you are strong and where you are strong, I am weak.
    <br>Having a friend who is weak where you are weak is not a productive relationship.
    <br>You are a smoker.
    <br>Now, you make a smoker friend.
    <br>Who will help who in such a relationship?
    <br>The smoker.
    <br>This is the life we live today.
    <br>This is just the life.
    <br>You see some people. They know how to dress, they can dress gorgeously.
    <br>All their friends too dress gorgeously.
    <br>They concentrate on their hair; they can do anything with their hair.
    <br>All their friends - all the same thing.
    <br>Who will help who in such a relationship?
    <br>I can't report you; you cannot report me.
    <br>I'm a smoker; you're a smoker.
    <br>This is the life we live today.
    <br>You have to sit down and check yourself.
    <br>The life you live does not help you to grow.
    <br>The friends you have around you - party, drinking, this, that.
    <br>Where you are weak, they are weak; where you are strong, they are strong.
    <br>Who will help who in such a relationship?
    <br>You talk anyhow; they too talk anyhow.
    <br>Who will now help you?
    <br>They are rich and you too are rich.
    <br>What is the value of money there?
    <br>For party.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are because I am; I am because you are.
    <br>Where I am weak, you are strong and where you are strong, I am weak.
    <br>Having a friend who is weak where you are weak is not a productive relationship;
    <br>it is not a godly relationship.
    <br>Check your friends around you.
    <br>All your friends - I don't think you have any friends that are there to help you.
    <br>You people live the same style.
    <br>When it is 9 pm, you people go out together - clubbing.
    <br>Who will help you, challenging you?
    <br>To build your career is not something you can do alone; you need good people.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "To build my career is not something I can do alone; I need good people".
    <br>But who are the friends, the people around you?
    <br>Who are they?
    <br>Be ready to relate with those who can report you, who will query everything you stand for.
    <br>"Why this? Why that?"
    <br>You should be ready to relate with people like that; that will help you.
    <br>You are lonely because you have a friend who is weak where you are weak.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am lonely because I have a friend who is weak where I am weak".
    <br>I am grumbling because I have a friend who is weak where I am weak.
    <br>I am hurt because I have a friend who is weak where I am weak.
    <br>I am complaining because I have a friend who is weak where I am weak.
    <br>That's all.
    <br>You need someone who will tell you, "You talk too much!"
    <br>Every night you go out for what? Party, every day party is not right.
    <br>You need someone who will query you.
    <br>You cannot succeed alone; you need good people to succeed.
    <br>What report do you have?
    <br>Healing has taken place, deliverance has taken place, prophecy has taken place.
    <br>What report do you have, including visions and dreams you have for the ministry?
    <br>You must submit it.
    <br>People that disturb you whilst the service is going on,
    <br>people that disturb you, people that are walking anyhow,
    <br>the ushers that do not compose themselves or the security - the approach given to you,
    <br>the members - their attitude towards you.
    <br>You cannot report it, you keep this to yourself - it will affect your blessing.
    <br>You have to write your report.
    <br>Wherever you find yourself as a believer, report whatever you see that is wrong.
    <br>Don't swallow it.
    <br>If not, you are not a believer.
    <br>Reporting should be an expression of believing.
    <br>What report do you have?
    <br>You should not take that report; you have to submit that report to the authority.
    <br>Report is like giving your tithe or offering.
    <br>It is as important as your offering.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So let us pray for the viewers.
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>Holy Spirit I look upon You
    <br>Help me
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>This means, you don't know how to pray.
    <br>The prayer you are about to offer now is the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Have you opened your heart for the Holy Spirit to contact?
    <br>The Holy Spirit needs to contact your heart.
    <br>Prayer is a thing of the heart.
    <br>Right now.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>You establish this first.
    <br>The Bible says there is power in our mouth.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith out of our mouth.
    <br>What releases the belief?
    <br>The belief in our heart is what?
    <br>It is released by faith.
    <br>It means, faith is the key.
    <br>The belief is in our heart.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith.
    <br>So now, now, now.
    <br>You can't just say, "I believe".
    <br>You must have a reason.
    <br>The reason for your belief is that Jesus is Lord.
    <br>Jesus is Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let every heart say, "Jesus is Lord!"
    <br>Right from your heart say, "Jesus is Lord!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus is Lord!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus is Lord!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus is Lord!]
    <br>Yes, Jesus is Lord - the Lord of your heart.
    <br>That is just the reason for your blessing.
    <br>That is just the reason for your deliverance,
    <br>the reason for your freedom today.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Receive a hearing heart!
    <br>A hearing heart will take this message:
    <br>Be ready to relate with people that can report you.
    <br>You see people reporting you as enemies.
    <br>No, they are not enemies!
    <br>This will make you to be very conscious of whatever...
    <br>You are here to report me; if I say anything...
    <br>That is what you are going to pick.
    <br>I'm being very conscious of whatever I will say, whatever I will do.
    <br>It is good.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be ready to relate with people that can report you".
    <br>Receive a hearing heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>There are many friends you need to sack when you leave from here today.
    <br>A lot of your friends.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't tell them I'm the one saying you should sack them.
    <br>Don't go and tell them.
    <br>Sack them.
    <br>You give them a condition, "Please, report me. Just report me.
    <br>I will report you; report me".
    <br>That is sack.
    <br>Once you say that, they will leave you.
    <br>"I will report you; report me." - you will not see them again.
    <br>This will help you to guard against hypocrisy, the hypocrisy of people -
    <br>those who love you with mouth but hate you with their heart.
    <br>You cannot succeed alone.
    <br>Jesus never succeeded alone.
    <br>That is why He had 12 disciples.
    <br>If Jesus could succeed alone, He would go alone to do everything, no disciples, nothing.
    <br>He would be doing everything on His own.
    <br>But He could not succeed alone; that is why He had 12 disciples.
    <br>You cannot succeed alone; it is not possible for you to succeed alone.
    <br>This report will guide you against hypocrisy.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Being a good reporter will guard you against hypocrisy - people that pretend to love you".
    <br>Receive a hearing heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Our heart is closed when it comes to truth.
    <br>"Ah, what is this man saying? Which kind of friend?
    <br>I should go and sack my friend?
    <br>I cannot report oo!"
    <br>That is what your heart is saying now.
    <br>That is why I'm saying, "Receive a hearing heart".
    <br>Your heart is telling me, "T.B. Joshua, be careful. I cannot report".
    <br>No, it is not you that is saying it - because you have no control over your heart.
    <br>Receive a hearing heart!
    <br>Receive a hearing heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive an obedient heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Obedience is the key.
    <br>Obedience is the key - key to success, healing, deliverance.
    <br>Receive an obedient heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Having a friend who is weak, who is a smoker and you too are a smoker - you cannot prosper!
    <br>Having a friend who is a liar, a 'club guy' -
    <br>and you too - there is no way you can proper.
    <br>Receive a hearing heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every unclean spirit - I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That spirit of self-will - what you want to do is not what you are doing.
    <br>What you intend to do is not what you are doing
    <br>but after you have done wrong, you start saying, "This is not what I want to do.
    <br>I don't know what is pushing me; I don't know what made me to do this".
    <br>I command that spirit to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You say, "What I want to do is not what I'm doing".
    <br>If what you want to do is not what you are doing, it means, it is sin in you.
    <br>I command that spirit to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You want to read your Bible; you want to pray but you suddenly find yourself very tired.
    <br>I command that spirit, in the name of Jesus - leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This is why we say, be conscious of what you are doing; you are a child of God.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You can know if you are delivered.
    <br>Agree with me in your heart - "I am delivered!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I'm delivered!]
    <br>I am delivered!
    <br>Every unclean spirit, every opposition - I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>This is just the challenge, problem - the spirit that opposes the will of God in your life.
    <br>You know the right thing but there is a spirit you cannot resist, that torments you.
    <br>You only pray when you have challenges; you pray when you have problems.
    <br>You remember to pray when you have problems
    <br>but when things are going well, you forget about God.
    <br>I command that spirit to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every unclean spirit - leave my people!
    <br>Our challenge is not two, just one - an unclean spirit, a spirit that you cannot resist,
    <br>a certain will - it's not God's will; it's your will - you cannot resist it.
    <br>I command deliverance on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>When I say, I can see you being delivered, indeed, I can see you.
    <br>You just agree with me!
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>I see your career being delivered!
    <br>Listen again.
    <br>I see your career being delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>If your career is delivered, you are what God says you are.
    <br>When your career is delivered, you can do what God says you can do.
    <br>If you are doing what God says you can do, you derive joy and peace;
    <br>you will be content.
    <br>But you are not content now.
    <br>You are still looking at others - you have been at the car park to see the kind of jeep parked there;
    <br>the type you will buy next week;
    <br>the kind of hairstyle, dress - you have been looking round to see people looking nice,
    <br>light in complexion, the way you are going to slim your body.
    <br>You are not content.
    <br>You compare yourself to others.
    <br>You have a lot of business cards in your pocket.
    <br>You are the architect, lawyer, accountant.
    <br>You are just accessible.
    <br>You can compromise; you can do anything.
    <br>You can trade yourself.
    <br>You can trade your country.
    <br>There is nothing you cannot trade.
    <br>Your career does not matter to you; you have forgotten about your future.
    <br>I want to advise you: You should be ready to suffer now and enjoy tomorrow.
    <br>Enjoying today and suffering tomorrow is not good.
    <br>Let me suffer now and enjoy tomorrow.
    <br>Jesus says you are delivered!
    <br>I say, you are delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You shouldn't trade anything with your future.
    <br>There is nothing to be compared with your future.
    <br>Anything can be compared with today but your future is a mystery.
    <br>All you are doing now is for your future, not for today.
    <br>We suddenly leave and forget about the future.
    <br>We suddenly leave and ignore our future.
    <br>We suddenly leave and disrespect our future.
    <br>This is the life we live - we leave and disrespect our future.
    <br>Future does not mean anything to us.
    <br>When you know your future and you respect your future,
    <br>whatever you are going through now will not matter to you.
    <br>The pain you are going through now - you just see it as normal.
    <br>You are feeling your pain because you don't know what your future holds.
    <br>We were persecuted 10 years ago, 5 years ago;
    <br>we were called all sorts of names - see today.
    <br>People say, "Ah, this man is not even bothered; he is very strong".
    <br>I'm strong because I know where I am going.
    <br>I say, you are delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command that deliverance on you, healing on you!
    <br>I can see you being healed!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can't hear your 'Amen'.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>The question remains: How do you feel?
    <br>You say 'Amen'.
    <br>When you say 'Amen', it means you agree.
    <br>That is the meaning of 'Amen'; agreement means 'Amen'.
    <br>I agree.
    <br>Be delivered! - "Amen!"
    <br>It means, I agree that I'm delivered.
    <br>'Amen' means the prayer I am offering for you - the way out for you has come!
    <br>Right now, pray for your country, your nation.
    <br>Whatever you have as a contact point, stretch it - your flag or whatever.
    <br>Stretch it, pray for your nation.
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Right now, open your heart and allow God's intervention in your nation, country.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Redemption!
    <br>Pray for your leaders - redemption!
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Every challenge - redemption!
    <br>Every obstacle - redemption!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Ask God for the grace to strengthen you for your righteous journey.
    <br>Strengthen me, Lord, to do Your will.
    <br>You need God to strengthen you.
    <br>Say, strengthen me, Lord!
    <br>Strengthen me to be faithful,
    <br>to be a channel - a channel of love,
    <br>to be a channel - a channel of faithfulness,
    <br>to be a channel - a channel of obedience,
    <br>to be a channel - a channel of holiness.
    <br>Strengthen me, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Right now, cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>Your heart - hear the voice of God!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
