    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is for Jesus, not for me.
    <br>So, we can do as much for Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I want to believe your heart is the one clapping.
    <br>Who is clapping there?
    <br>Your heart.
    <br>Let me see the state of your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The Spirit of God gave me a word for you.
    <br>That will lead us to the title:
    <br>THE MISINTERPRETATION OF NATURAL TALENTS AS SPIRITUAL GIFTS
    <br>I'm here now - you don't know who is here.
    <br>You don't know whether it is T.B. Joshua that is here today,
    <br>or the Holy Ghost, our Lord Jesus - you don't know.
    <br>You just want to hear the word, "Jesus is Lord. Jesus is Saviour, Redeemer".
    <br>Once you hear that, you accept me as a man of God.
    <br>You cannot see beyond that.
    <br>We are in perilous times - difficult and dangerous times.
    <br>You don't know.
    <br>What you know is a human being.
    <br>Like I'm here now, all you know is - this is a man, T.B. Joshua
    <br>but beyond me you cannot see.
    <br>You don't know who is talking to you now; that is the danger.
    <br>And I'm not supposed to be T.B. Joshua but the Holy Ghost.
    <br>This is the problem we have now.
    <br>You just want to hear, "Jesus is Lord. Amen! In Jesus' name."
    <br>Once you hear that - that church is a living church, that man is a man of God.
    <br>Once he gives you a wonderful, inspiring message -
    <br>you agree it is a man of God.
    <br>And he quotes Bible from Genesis to Revelation, "Ah - this one eats with Jesus".
    <br>"... Amen!" - he is a man of God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>"I'm telling you; Jesus is Lord. Amen? Amen! I'm a man of God."
    <br>There is confusion everywhere.
    <br>There is so much confusion.
    <br>So, we take our reading from the Book of 2 Chronicles 2:1-end
    <br>but the proof text you find in verses 13-14 there.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>When we finish there, we will go to the other side, which is 1 Peter 4:10-11.
    <br>That will really help you.
    <br>We are going to read those Books.
    <br>And finally, 1 Corinthians 12:1-end
    <br>but that verse 7-11 will answer our question here.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>In 2 Chronicles 2:13-14...
    <br>Let's, first of all, look at natural talents.
    <br>What we need to know is that
    <br>every human being, made in the image of God, is endowed with certain talents.
    <br>Every human being, made in the image of God, is endowed with certain natural talents.
    <br>What is your talent?
    <br>Whether you are a believer or unbeliever, whether you are an atheist or whatever you call yourself,
    <br>you are endowed with certain natural talents.
    <br>Talent is one of the characteristics that makes every human being peculiar, unique, different.
    <br>That is why we often say that this person is dancing well; the other one is better.
    <br>This person has "football skills", he can play football,
    <br>the other one - very skilful.
    <br>Having talent has nothing to do with being a Christian,
    <br>being a believer, an atheist.
    <br>Once you are a human being, made in the image of God, you are endowed.
    <br>Many atheists, unbelievers have the superb talent for one thing or another.
    <br>They have natural talents but they do not have spiritual gifts.
    <br>Christians, like anyone else, have natural talents
    <br>but natural talents should not be misinterpreted as spiritual gifts.
    <br>You should not confuse it - it is a different thing entirely.
    <br>Natural talents should not be misinterpreted as spiritual gifts.
    <br>It is a different thing entirely.
    <br>It is biblically incorrect for a Christian to say that his or her gift is repairing automobiles.
    <br>It is biblically incorrect that my gift is repairing automobiles, playing football, building houses -
    <br>it is incorrect.
    <br>These are all natural talents.
    <br>When I entered here, I was telling you that when people call me to say, "Jesus is Lord. Amen!",
    <br>you need to ask God who is talking.
    <br>That does not make him a child of God, pastor or whatever you call it.
    <br>Man has the ability to teach, preach, testify, witness, decide.
    <br>"OK, I'm going home" - Jesus will not say, "No, you are not going home!".
    <br>There is what we call discretion.
    <br>A person has power to decide or exercise the will through the mind
    <br>but the Holy Ghost has the power of choice.
    <br>The Holy Ghost has the power of choice.
    <br>God has the power of choice.
    <br>He chooses as He wills.
    <br>One thing I want you to know is that
    <br>having natural talents has nothing to do with being a Christian.
    <br>These two are misinterpreted in the society we are in today;
    <br>natural talents and spiritual gifts are misinterpreted
    <br>in the society, the world we are in today.
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 12:7-11 supernatural gifts are given to believers to minister to one another.
    <br>Supernatural gifts are given to believers to minister to one another.
    <br>It means you cannot talk for God without the Spirit of God,
    <br>you cannot run for God without the Spirit of God,
    <br>you cannot preach without the Spirit of God.
    <br>You cannot say "Amen" without the Spirit of God
    <br>because God is Spirit and His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.
    <br>Supernatural gifts are given to believers to minister to one another.
    <br>You cannot minister to one another with the Word alone.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You cannot minister to one another with the Word alone."
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>This means the Word is not complete without the Spirit and the Spirit is not complete without the Word.
    <br>It is like half of you,
    <br>from half of your head - if the body is sliced down.
    <br>It means half here and half here - it means you are no more.
    <br>You cannot have a half body and be living - your heart is there and every part of your body is there,
    <br>if your body is sliced into two halves;
    <br>one is spirit, the other one is word.
    <br>The Word is not complete without the Spirit and the Spirit is not complete without the Word.
    <br>So, the question:
    <br>What is the role of the Spirit of God?
    <br>Can somebody answer this question?
    <br>What is the role of the Spirit of God?
    <br>If the Word is not complete without the Spirit of God
    <br>and the Spirit is not complete without the Word of God,
    <br>what is the role of the Spirit?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It gives life to the Word.
    <br>OK, let me hear from my brother.
    <br>The Spirit gives life to the Word and it becomes a living Word.
    <br>Why should we now begin to worship God without the Spirit if we know this?
    <br>This is what we do all over the world.
    <br>Spiritual gifts and natural talents - these two are misinterpreted in the society we are in today.
    <br>We are using natural talents to serve God instead of spiritual gifts.
    <br>We are serving God but with natural talents.
    <br>The role of the Spirit of God is to lighten the Word.
    <br>This is the torch.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>This is the Word
    <br>but it is not complete, it is inactive now, without light.
    <br>Now, the Spirit of God is to lighten the Word.
    <br>This is the Word - now it is inactive, without being, without life.
    <br>Now, the role of the Spirit is to lighten the Word.
    <br>The Spirit lights the Word.
    <br>Without the Spirit of God, the Word will remain inactive - without being, without life.
    <br>The Word will remain idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive - very dangerous!
    <br>When you say, "In Jesus' name...",
    <br>when satan hears the name Jesus, he is always frightened.
    <br>Anywhere satan or demon, anyone of them, in your compound, house, where you are living,
    <br>maybe your neighbour is a ogbanje (witch), this, that...
    <br>And when they hear the word 'Jesus', they are always frightened,
    <br>"Who is calling the name Jesus" - they want to see.
    <br>"Who?"
    <br>Whereas the way you are calling it is inactive, without being, life, idle, meaningless.
    <br>When they now realize that you are calling that name without the Spirit,
    <br>they will jump on you, afflict you, kick you,
    <br>afflict you with poverty, sickness, disease and others.
    <br>You know what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>The name of Jesus Christ is not used as an instrument to get results.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The name of Jesus Christ is not used as an instrument to get results.]
    <br>The name of Jesus Christ is not used as an instrument to get results
    <br>Again.
    <br>[The name of Jesus Christ is not used as an instrument to get results]
    <br>Again, I can't hear you!
    <br>[The name of Jesus Christ is not used as an instrument to get results]
    <br>but to get the authority of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The name of Jesus Christ is not used as an instrument to get results
    <br>but to get the authority of Jesus Christ.
    <br>This what the seven sons of Sceva were doing
    <br>and this is what we are doing today.
    <br>It means that the generation of seven sons of Sceva - they are in the world today.
    <br>And I'm very sure; 99 percent of people in the world today that claim to be Christians -
    <br>they are a generation of seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>The name of Jesus Christ is not used as an instrument to get results
    <br>but to get the authority of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The role of the Spirit is to lighten the Word.
    <br>Without the Spirit of God, the Word will remain inactive,
    <br>without being, without life - idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>What are we talking about?
    <br>We are talking about those of us that minister to one another;
    <br>minister healing, prayer, deliverance with the Word alone.
    <br>It is dangerous!
    <br>If I now minister to you, "Be healed!" with the Word alone,
    <br>you know what will happen?
    <br>The challenges you have will come to me.
    <br>You have a headache and I now pray for you with the Word alone.
    <br>That headache will leave you and come to me.
    <br>If I cannot deliver you, you will deliver me.
    <br>That is the principle of deliverance.
    <br>When I say I want to deliver you and I cannot deliver you,
    <br>and I say, "In Jesus' name" with the Word alone...
    <br>Sickness, hardship, poverty - this is what is going on.
    <br>Suddenly you see a pastor committing suicide; a lot of things happen all over the world,
    <br>because we get their troubles, instead of delivering them from their troubles
    <br>because we minister with the Word only.
    <br>Not only ministers, this is the problem Christians are facing.
    <br>You keep saying, "I'm born-again", you keep praying for people.
    <br>What do you mean by 'praying for people'?
    <br>The Word is not complete without the Spirit and the Spirit is not complete without the Word.
    <br>What is the role of the Spirit?
    <br>The role of the Spirit is to light the Word.
    <br>Without the Spirit, the Word will remain inactive, without being, life.
    <br>When you minister with the Word alone, you will receive an attack.
    <br>This is why in the dream, when you sleep, after you prayed for people in the daylight,
    <br>when you are about to sleep, you will start having a lot of attacks from these people.
    <br>God's Word refreshes our mind.
    <br>If I'm talking without the Spirit of God, "Jesus is Lord", you will be happy...
    <br>At that moment you will even forget your challenges.
    <br>That is mere refreshing.
    <br>God's Spirit renews our strength.
    <br>Do you know how God works?
    <br>Let me tell you how God works.
    <br>Come, madam - you will be God in this world now.
    <br>Wait here.
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>Our father will be the Word.
    <br>Our mummy here will be Spirit.
    <br>When I say 'God', I mean power.
    <br>When you say 'God', it means power.
    <br>This is God, I mean power.
    <br>We want to demonstrate how this power flows.
    <br>Through His Word, it works.
    <br>This is Word.
    <br>And His Spirit.
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>This is a new birth, a new creation - to bring a new creation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If any of these is missing...
    <br>Let's say the Spirit is missing - leave the place.
    <br>Since He works through His Word - where is the Spirit?
    <br>He cannot give what?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the life we live today all over the world.
    <br>We complain, "I pray, I pay my tithe, I'm a member. Emmanuel!"
    <br>Since the Spirit is not there, the Word is here - you cannot give a new birth.
    <br>A new birth means salvation, deliverance, healing, blessing, breakthrough, whatever miracle;
    <br>that is a new birth we are talking about.
    <br>You say, "I'm born again" - this is it.
    <br>He works through His Word and His Spirit to bring a new birth.
    <br>This is how God works.
    <br>But you are serving God through His Word - where is the Spirit?
    <br>There is no resort.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>They normally give you fruits - come and take your fruit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Indeed - God!
    <br>She took the big one.
    <br>She wants to show the world, "I'm bigger than you".
    <br>She wants to show the Spirit, a new birth, "I'm bigger than you";
    <br>she carried pineapple.
    <br>You understand now.
    <br>God's power working through His Word and Spirit to bring a new birth.
    <br>What is a new birth?
    <br>A new creation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We have talked about natural talents, which I need to explain more.
    <br>What you need to know:
    <br>Christians, like anyone else, have natural talents
    <br>but natural talents should not be misinterpreted as spiritual gifts.
    <br>Because you have 'eloquent speech'... -
    <br>it is a natural talent and that is not the way of God.
    <br>We are still coming back to 1 Peter 4:11.
    <br>Let's go there.
    <br>1 Peter 4:11
    <br>"If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God..."
    <br>What other way there is?
    <br>It is funny - I like that.
    <br>Listen to that; I read again.
    <br>"If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God..."
    <br>It means there is 'a' way and there is 'the' way.
    <br>How can we speak the Word of God?
    <br>We speak the Words of God through His Word and His Spirit
    <br>because the Word is not complete without the Spirit
    <br>and the Spirit is not complete without the Word.
    <br>If you want to preach, you should know that man has the ability to preach
    <br>but the Holy Spirit preaches as He wills.
    <br>If you want to teach the Word of God, don't forget man has the ability to teach
    <br>but the Holy Spirit teaches as He wills.
    <br>If you want to pray, remember we have no power but the Spirit helps us to pray.
    <br>Man has the ability to pray but the Holy Spirit prays as He wills.
    <br>But when you want to pray, you bring your prayer book.
    <br>You count the number of your grandmothers you want to rebuke,
    <br>your boss in the place of work - you want to bind him today.
    <br>The nightmare you normally have - you mark the number of the prayer,
    <br>"Holy Ghost!
    <br>In Jesus' name. Amen!"
    <br>Can you see what the Bible is saying?
    <br>It says, "... if anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides..."
    <br>The strength I give is not as the world gives.
    <br>The greeting, "Good Morning" I give is not as the world gives it.
    <br>It says if you want to serve, you should do so in the strength of God.
    <br>I think we need this moment when you realize that you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I need this moment, moment I will realise I'm deceiving myself".
    <br>"I'm a born again. I'm a man of God."
    <br>There is a moment you need to know - you will humble yourself.
    <br>And you are not serving that God, the real God we are talking about.
    <br>Look at the demonstration we gave.
    <br>God working through His Word and His Spirit to answer you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour!
    <br>[God working through His Word and His Spirit to answer you.]
    <br>For God to say, "Yes, T.B. Joshua, I hear you. What do you want?"
    <br>It means I must have been working or praying through His Word and His Spirit
    <br>before He can say, "T.B. Joshua, I can hear what you are saying.
    <br>OK. Don't worry, I will give you."
    <br>It means I went through His Word and His Spirit - that is the only way.
    <br>If not, you will be hearing yourself when you pray - you will get tired.
    <br>You will say, "Amen! In Jesus' name!" - whereas you are tired.
    <br>Not that God said you should close the chapter.
    <br>Open the Book of John 6:63.
    <br>"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.
    <br>The words I have spoken to you - they are full of the Spirit..."
    <br>Jesus is saying here, in John 6:63, He is telling us that
    <br>'The words I have spoken to you are Spirit and life.'
    <br>That shows God's power working through His Word and His Spirit to answer you.
    <br>This means God's power working through His Word and His Spirit to bless you.
    <br>This means God's power working through His Word and His Spirit to save you.
    <br>Jesus said in John 6:63, 'The words I have spoken to you are Spirit and life'.
    <br>This means Jesus working through His Word and His Spirit to hear you, to heal you,
    <br>to bless you, to save you, to attend to you.
    <br>The Word is God speaking to you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Word is God speaking to you."
    <br>It means there is a word and there is the Word.
    <br>The Word is God speaking to you.
    <br>A word is the word you speak - the language of today.
    <br>A word is the language of today;
    <br>the Word is the language of the Bible that heals, blesses, saves, delivers.
    <br>Why is the Word different from a word?
    <br>The Word is different from a word because through His Word and His Spirit they deliver.
    <br>If the Word is not lightened by the Spirit, it cannot be pure.
    <br>If the Word is not pure, definitely it is not sure.
    <br>And it the Word is not pure, it cannot attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>What do I mean by the word 'pure'?
    <br>If God does not put His Word in your mouth, it cannot be pure.
    <br>The Word heals, blesses, saves when it is pure.
    <br>A Christian is someone who God Himself put His Word into his mouth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>"A Christian, a minister, a pastor, a bishop, a prophet - just name the titles -
    <br>is someone who God Himself put His Word into his mouth."
    <br>Say it again,
    <br>"A pastor, Christian, prophet is someone who God Himself put His Word into his mouth."
    <br>When He puts His Word into your mouth, when you speak it, it heals.
    <br>When He puts His Word into your mouth, when you speak it, it saves.
    <br>When He puts His Word into your mouth, when you speak it, it delivers - it's only God!
    <br>I said to you at the beginning that the name of Jesus is not used as an instrument to get results
    <br>but to get the authority of the name Jesus Christ.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Are you happy?"
    <br>If you are not happy, I'm ready to go on my knees.
    <br>Please, be happy!
    <br>Unless you promise you are going to obey the Word, I will not leave.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You keep deceiving yourself by saying you are serving God.
    <br>Which God are you serving with the Word alone?
    <br>You are deceiving yourself.
    <br>Now, we are in a perilous, very difficult time.
    <br>Hear what is happening all over the world - fearful year.
    <br>A lot happened.
    <br>Our protection is God.
    <br>You say you are serving God - you are not a Christian, you are a religious person.
    <br>God is the Rewarder.
    <br>Who is the Rewarder?
    <br>God always rewards the obedient.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward smart people, rich people, good people, educated people.
    <br>He rewards the obedient.
    <br>He will not reward you because you are very good but because you are an obedient servant.
    <br>But today you want to be very good, not obedient.
    <br>You want to be very rich; you don't mind how you get the money, how you get the property,
    <br>how you get there, and the processing is God, not where you get to.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Processing is God, not where you are."
    <br>How you get there is God, not where you are.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "How you get there is God, not where you are."
    <br>Processing.
    <br>If food is not processed well...
    <br>The soup you are eating every day and enjoy -
    <br>if the ingredient is not well packaged, you will not enjoy it.
    <br>In place of salt they put sugar, in place of pepper they put mango...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look at what we are facing here in the ministry, Emmanuel TV, in The Synagogue -
    <br>a lot of persecution.
    <br>It is not just one person persecution - you can imagine the persecution all over the world,
    <br>country to country, but the church stands because the processing was clear.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How we got here?
    <br>Clear.
    <br>That is why we show our documentary.
    <br>You saw when the church was one, second, foundation - everything you were able to see.
    <br>It is a visionary job.
    <br>How you get there - not where you are but how you get there is God.
    <br>Processing.
    <br>Processing of many of us is very bad.
    <br>And what God does not form, He does not maintain.
    <br>If this church was not God's, Holy Ghost's foundation,
    <br>what you are seeing now would be history because the foundation is God.
    <br>What you say about T.B. Joshua does not matter, if T.B. Joshua is from God.
    <br>What you say about him does not matter, if this man is from God.
    <br>What people say about you does not matter, if you are from God.
    <br>What they say about you is an advert.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is an advert.
    <br>People say, "You are this, that..." - it is an advert.
    <br>Sometimes when I'm going around, I see the sign boards everywhere, "I'm this. I sell biscuits, mango.
    <br>I'm a dancer - come and see the way I dance." - you don't need this.
    <br>Just one visit to people is enough.
    <br>You see the sign boards everywhere.
    <br>Please - your processing.
    <br>The way you get your money and become rich,
    <br>the way you get your fame,
    <br>the way you get your popularity,
    <br>the way you get your status, dominion,
    <br>the way you get there matters.
    <br>People don't mind, they just want to get there.
    <br>And they don't know that how we get there is God Himself.
    <br>Because anybody can get to where you are.
    <br>You say you are rich - anybody can be rich.
    <br>Anybody can be in the position you are
    <br>but how they get there makes them god, satan.
    <br>You say you are rich and you want to be like this rich man.
    <br>But do you know how he got there?
    <br>If you knew how he got there, you can pray to be like him.
    <br>How I got here is what is maintaining me.
    <br>Anytime I want to go this way, I remember how I worked.
    <br>So please, take note of this again:
    <br>The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward the rich people.
    <br>He will not reward you because you are rich but because you are obedient.
    <br>He will not reward you because you are good but because you are obedient.
    <br>He will not reward you because you are very educated but because you are obedient.
    <br>I want to believe you are blessed.
    <br>You should know the difference - spiritual gifts help us to define what a Christian does
    <br>but the fruit of the Spirit helps us to define what a Christian is.
    <br>Thank you; bless you.
