    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Tse Wun Ting from Hong Kong.
    <br>This is my husband.
    <br>His name is Caleb Lam.
    <br>The last time I came to The SCOAN was in January this year.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was depression.
    <br>In the past, for 10 years I had the problem of depression.
    <br>I easily felt unhappy because of people's comments and reaction to me.
    <br>Sometimes when I would wake up, my brain would be full of negative thoughts.
    <br>I didn't want to go to work, pray or talk to my family members.
    <br>I was really sad.
    <br>When I was very frustrated and depressed, I had the thoughts of committing suicide.
    <br>After I got married in 2017, I had the thoughts of divorce with no reason.
    <br>Actually, my husband did nothing wrong in our marriage or even to me.
    <br>He treats me very well as always but I still had the thoughts of divorce.
    <br>After the man of God prayed for me and touched me, I felt the love of Jesus.
    <br>I was very touched and I cried.
    <br>After returning to Hong Kong, my mindset was totally different and I felt happy, instantly.
    <br>I no longer have the thoughts of suicide and divorce.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>What happened to the depression?
    <br>The depression has gone.
    <br>Hallelujah! Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>That clap is not loud enough for Jesus.
    <br>If you know Jesus is a miracle-working God, put your hands together louder for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My name is Caleb Lam from Hong Kong.
    <br>The woman standing next to me is my wife.
    <br>The testimony I want to share is:
    <br>My wife had depression and suicide thoughts.
    <br>She wanted to get divorced from me in the past.
    <br>Before she came to The SCOAN, her mindset was very negative.
    <br>Anyone next to me or around her, talking anything to her,
    <br>she would think that that person doesn't love or like her.
    <br>She was thinking about negative things.
    <br>Sometimes she even thought about dying and committing suicide.
    <br>After we got married, during these 1.5 years, she suddenly wanted to get divorced from me
    <br>and she told me a few times that she wanted a divorce.
    <br>I asked her, "Why? I did not do anything wrong towards you or in our marriage and I love you so much".
    <br>But she said, "I don't know the reason but I don't want to be married to you now, I want a divorce".
    <br>After she came back from The SCOAN to Hong Kong,
    <br>I feel that she is totally different in her mindset
    <br> because when people around her talk something negative about her
    <br>or a negative thing in the environment or the society,
    <br>she doesn't think anything negative.
    <br>She has become a very positive thinking person.
    <br>After her deliverance, I never heard that she wants to get divorced from me.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Now that she is delivered,
    <br>I would like to advise Emmanuel TV viewers all over the world
    <br>because the Bible says that two people become one after marriage,
    <br>people can't divorce because you need to follow God's Word
    <br>and God will solve our problems; with God, everything is possible.
    <br>I want to speak to people all over the world - open your heart to Jesus.
    <br>With Jesus, all things are possible.
    <br>He can solve all our problems.
    <br>Just leave it to Jesus and He can solve it.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for transforming your life and your marriage
    <br>and we want to advise you to continue to follow Jesus Christ along the way,
    <br>as no state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with God.
    <br>and we pray that God Almighty will give you that grace to stay far from sin
    <br>and be close to Him always, in Jesus' name.
    <br>So once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Now I love my husband very much.
