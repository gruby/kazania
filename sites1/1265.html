  <p>    
    <br>Merry Christmas!
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>A lot of people believe that this is a season of giving.
    <br>If this is the season of giving, let us rededicate ourselves to the act of giving.
    <br>Because I know you have not been giving.
    <br>You have not been giving.
    <br>What is not done well is not done at all.
    <br>You have not been giving.
    <br>Let us rededicate ourselves to the act of giving.
    <br>This is the season - rededicate yourself.
    <br>Let us not forget that Jesus knows our heart and the motive behind our giving.
    <br>Sometimes when you want to give, you have a reason of giving.
    <br>That is the kind of giving you are giving.
    <br>Jesus knows our hearts and the motive behind our giving.
    <br>We only have reason of giving - motive behind our love.
    <br>You see your brother loves you.
    <br>Why does he love you? He has a reason.
    <br>Motive behind our care - you care for your brother, you have respect.
    <br>- "Emmanuel, sir."
    <br>- I look at you and know, "You too, Emmanuel, sir."
    <br>He knows our hearts and the motive behind our action.
    <br>The reason why many are here today - you have a reason.
    <br>Motive behind your giving, love, care.
    <br>"Good morning, sir."
    <br>"Hello, sir."
    <br>The world has turned like that for selfish, classic, material reasons.
    <br>If you give to people, to your neighbour
    <br>because you're expecting them to give you in return, you give wrongly.
    <br>You help your neighbour and you are expecting your neighbour to help you in return -
    <br>that is not of God.
    <br>God is the Rewarder.
    <br>He is the Rewarder.
    <br>If you give to your neighbour, brother, sister, whoever you give
    <br>because you are expecting them to give you in return,
    <br>oh my God - this is the kind of life we are living today.
    <br>This is the kind of giving you are doing.
    <br>This is the kind of love you express.
    <br>This is the kind of care.
    <br>You see humility, "Oh, he is humble" - he has a reason.
    <br>When you give out what you do not need, that is not sacrifice.
    <br>You open your garage, you see fleet of cars, tyres, rice.
    <br>You say, "Come on and take anything you like".
    <br>The one they are taking, can you ask yourself, "How long ago did you use that one last?"
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you give out what you do not need, that is not sacrifice".
    <br>Giving is sacrifice.
    <br>When you give what your life depends on, the next day you wake up
    <br>and say, "Oh, this is what I need to use today. I have given it out".
    <br>That is sacrifice.
    <br>But you have been giving what you do not need, time you do not need.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Never come around people just because of what you will get
    <br>but come around people because of what you can give".
    <br>Jesus said in Acts, 20:35, it is more blessed to give than to receive.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Never come around your neighbour just because of what you can get.
    <br>You go to the party, you will sit down, they will serve you rice, food, beautiful food
    <br>and you will eat. After eating, you take a plastic bag, taking the remaining rice.
    <br>You have nothing to give to the celebrant and you are going home -
    <br>you are putting a curse on yourself.
    <br>This is the life many of us live.
    <br>You go to weddings, parties, you sit down.
    <br>Instead of you to prepare something with you...
    <br>Can you imagine - "Oh, I'm going to this wedding".
    <br>You can imagine - "What shall I be expecting?"
    <br>"Oh, they are a big family."
    <br>"Ok, let me take so and so amount along with me."
    <br>"I will not take anything there without giving."
    <br>You come around people all the time just because of what you can get
    <br>but not what you can give.
    <br>That is a shameless future; it is affecting the future.
    <br>Jesus said in Acts 20:35, it is more blessed to give than to receive.
    <br>If you know that, and they invite you to a party, an occasion,
    <br>and you know that occasion is so superior, you may decide not to go
    <br>because you know what they will be giving you will be more than what you will give them.
    <br>You decide, "No, no, I cannot go there because what I'm going to meet,
    <br>what they will serve me, the rice, the provision I will receive there,
    <br>I know I will not be able to meet up".
    <br>You decide not to go because it is not good for your life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again, "Never come around people just because of what you will get".
    <br>Never come around people just because of what you can get
    <br>but come around people because of what you can give.
    <br>It is more blessed to give than to receive.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the life I'm living.
    <br>No matter how great you are, if you meet me, the relationship must be mutual.
    <br>When you give me two, I give you three.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So to that, you have to be very careful when it comes to relationships
    <br>because you want to be a friend of all, everyone.
    <br>Are you prepared for that relationship?
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again:
    <br>Never come around people just because of what you can get
    <br>but come around people because of what you can give.
    <br>Relationship is mutual.
    <br>Jesus said categorically to people in that Book of Acts 20:35,
    <br>it is more blessed to give than to receive.
    <br>Now today, we are here.
    <br>"Jesus, heal me. Jesus, deliver me."
    <br>"Jesus, this; Jesus, that."
    <br>Whatever you do to the least out there, that you do to God.
    <br>How many people have you helped today?
    <br>Whatever you do to the least out there, that you do to God.
    <br>Jesus has no farm; He has no office but people are His office.
    <br>How many people have you helped today and you want Jesus to heal you?
    <br>How many people have you helped today and you want Jesus to deliver you?
    <br>How many people have you helped today and you want Jesus to bless you?
    <br>"Give me!"
    <br>How many people are you going to help?
    <br>Take this.
    <br>Never come around people just because of what you can get
    <br>but come around people because of what you can give.
    <br>Blessed is he who gives than he who receives.
    <br>So we are not giving you all this.
    <br>This is money but we don't want you to give us.
    <br>Go and bless the poor out there.
    <br>Look for your neighbour.
    <br>People that need you most are out there.
    <br>They are your neighbour - not even here.
    <br>Your neighbours out there - they need you.
    <br>We give you freely; please, go and give them out there.
    <br>So, where are we going?
    <br>If I help you and you help your neighbour, this world will be at peace.
    <br>I help you; you help your neighbour.
    <br>I'm your brother's keeper; you are your neighbour's keeper.
    <br>Let us be our brother's keeper; the world will be at peace.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let us be our brother's keeper; the world will be at peace".
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>Let us be our brother's keeper; the world will be at peace.
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Let us be our brother's keeper; the world will be at peace.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>To be our brother's keeper is when you see your brother frown,
    <br>you say, "Brother, what can I do for you? What is wrong?"
    <br>You want to know from time to time, "What is going on?"
    <br>Be your brother's keeper; don't wait until your brother asks you, "I need your help".
    <br>It is not everyone that can ask.
    <br>Some people are very... - they are ready to die with their problem.
    <br>By countenance, appearance, dominion, you can know that this one is going through some stress.
    <br>Your neighbour in the house.
    <br>You live in the house, you see children that never go to school.
    <br>They play football on Sunday, Monday - every day you see them moving around, playing.
    <br>"Where are your parents?"
    <br>Invest in the life of people.
    <br>This will speak for you tomorrow.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Invest in the life of people.
    <br>This will speak for you in the future".
    <br>That is all.
    <br>We have not been investing in the life of people; we invest in material.
    <br>If you are conscious of the future, you will invest in the lives of people.
    <br>Conscious of tomorrow, conscious of next.
    <br>Conscious of what will happen tomorrow.
    <br>I mean, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year - what will happen this next year?
    <br>Begin to invest in the life of people.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
    <br>I know you want to go to a party tomorrow - there are a lot of parties.
    <br>This is the season of parties - you want to go to a party, wedding, every party.
    <br>Oh my brother, prepare.
    <br>If they give you three, give them four.
    <br>Don't just go there and eat, eat, eat.
    <br>Going there and eat, eat, eat - you are eating your career.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say, "He is a millionaire".
    <br>Ok, he is a millionaire. Do you want to eat him?
    <br>"He is a millionaire. Let's go there."
    <br>I hope you carry a "hula".
