    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Augustine Joseph.
    <br>I am coming from Uruguay, Montevideo.
    <br>I have lumbar spondylosis and arthritis.
    <br>These problems have made it so difficult for me to do anything in my life.
    <br>For two years, I have been unable to do anything.
    <br>I am always down and I don't know how to describe the pain.
    <br>Sometimes, I just feel like taking my life because I am tired of the whole thing.
    <br>I have a medical report stating that I have lumbar spondylosis.
    <br>I have been to hospitals in Uruguay.
    <br>I have been to different hospitals and they wanted to operate on me.
    <br>I said, "No," because they said it was 50-50.
    <br>If I underwent an operation, I would either end up in a wheelchair or it would be successful.
    <br>I came here because I believe God and also believe I will be healed.
    <br>Believing God for a permanent solution,
    <br>Mr Augustine Joseph slowly makes his way to the Mountain of Prayer.
    <br>We can see that he is in pain, as he climbs with great difficulty,
    <br>leaning on the rail for support.

    <br>As he gets to the top, he lays on the altar and begins to pray to his only Solution Provider.
    <br>Praying On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>Sensing a change in his body, Mr Augustin Joseph
    <br>removed the lumbar corset he had been using for support.
    <br>He immediately gets up and joyfully starts to demonstrate his instant healing.
    <br>Glory to God - instant healing.
    <br>Healed Of Difficulty In Walking
    <br>No Longer Using A Lumbar Corset
    <br>I can do everything now!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus; I am free!
    <br>Father Lord, I thank You for my life!
    <br>Could you do all these things before?
    <br>No, I couldn't do it because the pain was severe.
    <br>Now, I can look at myself and be happy.
    <br>What happened to you when you were praying here?
    <br>I could feel the fire burning my body.
    <br>- You mean you felt fire burning you?
    <br>- Every part of my body felt hot inside.
    <br>That is the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>So now you are free.
    <br>I am free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Augustine Joseph.
    <br>I am a Nigerian but I reside in Uruguay, Montevideo.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, it wasn't easy, just as you saw on the screen.
    <br>First, I want to say, Good Morning, people of God!
    <br>Now, I am so excited; my heart is filled with a lot of joy.
    <br>This problem started in 2018.
    <br>I woke up one morning around 10 am, dressed up, prepared to go to work.
    <br>I tried to bend down to pick my bag after which I realised I couldn't stand upright anymore.
    <br>I called my wife and asked her to get some pills for me from the pharmacy.
    <br>She went to the pharmacy, got me the pills which I took but the pain persisted.
    <br>After a month without any solution in sight, I decided to go to the hospital.
    <br>After running all the tests, it was discovered that I had lumbar spondylosis.
    <br>I asked the doctor the way forward and he said I had to undergo an operation.
    <br>The doctor said it would be a 50-50 chance -
    <br>it would either be successful or I would end up in a wheelchair.
    <br>I objected to the operation and walked out.
    <br>The pain was so serious as it deprived me of many things, physically and psychologically.
    <br>For two years I was not working.
    <br>I could not organise concerts as an artiste.
    <br>All the time, I had to lie down flat because standing or sitting was so difficult for me.
    <br>I had been following Emmanuel TV for a long time on YouTube.
    <br>My wife said that I needed to be there to receive my healing.
    <br>I decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I started walking to The Mountain of Prayer, I felt fire from my toes upward.
    <br>By the time I got to the altar and lay down, I felt a burning sensation all over my body.
    <br>Then I heard a voice telling me silently, "It is done; you are healed."
    <br>Healed Of Difficulty In Walking
    <br>No Longer Using A Lumbar Corset
    <br>I removed the lumbar corset because I did not need it anymore.
    <br>I just saw myself on the screen squatting, which I never realised I did on that day.
    <br>Healed Of Difficulty In Walking
    <br>No Longer Using A Lumbar Corset
    <br>So now, physically you are fine, no problems, no more pain.
    <br>I can squat now!
    <br>- No pain?
    <br>- No more pain.
    <br>I can squat!
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>The Book of Proverbs 3:5-6 says,
    <br>"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding..."
    <br>That is wonderful advice, that we should not lean to our understanding;
    <br>we should trust in God, whatever our problem is, whatever out circumstance -
    <br>believe that He is the Answer to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>And we thank God for this wonderful healing you have received,
    <br>and we believe that as you make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>that wonderful healing you have received will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>- The best is yet to come.
    <br>- Thank You, Lord Jesus.
