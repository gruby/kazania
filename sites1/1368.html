  <p>    
    <br>I want to personally introduce this wonderful cherubim voice in your worship, in your song.
    <br>You can use it as a prayer.
    <br>You can meditate on this while you are about to sleep, before finally sleeping.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Sin's power.
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Come on, lift your voice and say:
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus rose I rose
    <br>When He rose we rose
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is for you - for your prayer, for your communion with God.
    <br>So we can sing it now, even without the choristers.
    <br>Let's sing it together.
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That 'went' represents death.
    <br>When Jesus died - no, He went!
    <br>Spiritually, physically, He is still there for us;
    <br>so, it's 'went', not 'death'.
