    <br>The word 'LOVE' has been watered down today.
    <br>What does the love of God mean?
    <br>Jesus said clearly, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments."

    <br>Dear partners, people of God,
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>It is more blessed to give than to receive.
    <br>What have you given today?
    <br>Are you being led by the Holy Spirit
    <br>or you are being led by your emotions or intellect to give?
    <br>Many have asked why on Emmanuel TV there is no display of bank account details,
    <br>there is no speaking about tithes and offerings all the time.
    <br>"Why are you not asking for tithes and offerings all the time?" they are asking.
    <br>Our message today shall be taken from 2 Corinthians 9:6-7.
    <br>I read.
    <br>"But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,
    <br>and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
    <br>So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity;
    <br>for God loves a cheerful giver."
    <br>Viewers, the Word of God - the Bible - is our database for our personal opinion.
    <br>Watch and pray.
    <br>It is scriptural to give an offering, to pay tithes, as the Bible says in Malachi 3:10.
    <br>But tithes and offerings must come from the people led by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>But the Scriptures also teach us the way and manner this should be done.
    <br>Romans 14:5 says, "Let everyone be convinced in his own mind." That is, genuine willingness to give.
    <br>Since we are not reminded to pray, it is the Holy Spirit that opens our hearts to pray.
    <br>We don't know how to pray.
    <br>In the same vein, we don't know how to pay tithes and offerings;
    <br>it is the Holy Spirit that leads us.
    <br>All acts of faith - praying, singing, dancing, worshipping, offering, tithing and fasting -
    <br>are but acts of self-surrender to God.
    <br>I mean, genuine willingness - willing submission to God.
    <br>These are things of the spirit;
    <br>they must come spontaneously from a willing heart, a willing spirit.
    <br>That we are not speaking about tithes and offerings or placing information on the screen all the time
    <br>does not mean it is not scriptural.
    <br>On our own part, we want to make sure that you are led by the Holy Spirit
    <br>so that whatever comes from you can be a blessing to you and us.
    <br>They are not many but such are people of conscience.
    <br>What do I mean by 'people of conscience'?
    <br>Those who are led by the Spirit of the Father do things with all their hearts and are blessed of God.
    <br>It is their conscience that prompts them to give, as God's Word says in Exodus 25:2.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>The situation we find ourselves in demands conscience.
    <br>Allow your conscience to prompt you.
    <br>People of faith are informed people, inspired people.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit that opens their hearts to pray; they don't know how to pray
    <br>but they know that tithes and offerings are things of the spirit,
    <br>just as prayer is a thing of the spirit.
    <br>Without direction from the Spirit of God, if we give, we give of ourselves.
    <br>With all our heart, let us give what is pure, just and admirable.
    <br>The more we help, especially to further the Kingdom of God,
    <br>the more God expands our coast, because it is more rewarding to give than to receive.
    <br>Ask Cornelius in Acts 10 and he will tell you that giving, especially to further the work of God,
    <br>offers us the opportunity to reshape our destiny.
    <br>Cornelius was a man of prayer.
    <br>He planted love by giving generously to the needy and he attracted God's special attention.
    <br>He received the heavenly blessings of Abraham that enriched his soul for eternity.
    <br>I mean, he received the salvation of his soul.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Let us be led by the Holy Spirit to give, to pray, to worship.
    <br>Let us be led by the Holy Spirit in offering, in counselling, in fasting
    <br>for whatever is not from Him has no heavenly reward.
    <br>Whatever is not of Him has no heavenly reward.
    <br>Those who humble themselves under God have taken the best course to secure themselves.
    <br>Partners, people of God,
    <br>thank you for your continuous support for the kingdom of God, for the work of God,
    <br>and for reaching out to our troubled world.
    <br>Thank you for joining us in changing lives, changing nations and changing the world.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
