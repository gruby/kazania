    <br>Begin to find those areas you need to surrender;
    <br>areas you need to confess in your life.
    <br>You know yourself more than anyone because what is about to happen
    <br>is destined for you to be free.
    <br>Yes, I am very sure you'll be released today.
    <br>You will begin to count your blessings after this prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "I will begin to count my blessings after this prayer".
    <br>Halleluyah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, be ready to begin to count your blessings after the prayer.
    <br>Whatever medium you are using to view us, it is the will of God to bless you.
    <br>I say, it is the will of God to heal you.
    <br>It is his way to deliver you.
    <br>You know that?
    <br>[Yes.]
    <br>Okay, begin to show that faith, that belief.
    <br>So if you believe that, you begin to confess your blessing, your breakthrough.
    <br>Whilst you are waiting to receive, confess it.
    <br>Whilst I'm waiting to receive the blessing, I say, "Thank You Jesus, I am blessed".
    <br>That is the heart of faith.
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>Holy Spirit, we thank You.
    <br>We thank You.
    <br>We recognize Your presence.
    <br>Yes, we are welcome.
    <br>Say, "I am welcome."
    <br>"I'm conscious that I'm welcome."
    <br>Say, "I'm welcome."
    <br>I say, "I am welcome."
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>What can hinder you or stop you in the presence of God?
    <br>I can´t hear you.
    <br>[Nothing!]
    <br>Say to yourself, "What can stop me in the presence of God?
    <br>Because His presence is mighty.
    <br>What can stop my blessing? What can stop my healing in the presence of Jesus?"
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>I surrender!
    <br>Jesus!

    <br>The word I'm saying is not mine.
    <br>The word you hear from me is not mine.
    <br>I'm just a vessel; I'm just being used.
    <br>When Jesus says, "It is over", it is over!
    <br>I say, when Jesus says, "It is over", it is over!
    <br>Do you want to hear, "It is over!" from Jesus?
    <br>It is over!

    <br>Right now, it is possible that you may not believe yourself but believe Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It is possible you may not believe yourself

    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Begin to rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Why are you rejoicing?"
    <br>Because it is over!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Because you want me to tell you to rejoice before you rejoice.
    <br>I have a way of telling you.
    <br>I know you because you don't believe yourself but you believe Jesus.
    <br>You don't believe yourself but you believe Jesus.
    <br>If I'm right, let me see your hand.
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Why are you rejoicing?"
    <br>Because it is over!
    <br>That is the message I hear.
    <br>I was hearing breakthrough.
    <br>I said, "Father, you mean breakthrough?"
    <br>He said, "It is over!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Amen!
    <br>I rejoice with you.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Viewers, the word 'breakthrough' from Father, Jesus means, it is over!
    <br>When Jesus says, "You are healed", you are healed.
    <br>When Jesus says, "You are saved", you are saved.
    <br>When Jesus says, "You are blessed", you are blessed.

    <br>You are free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Why are you rejoicing?
    <br>Because it is over!
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah! I want to rejoice with you once again.
    <br>Take this word as you are going now.
    <br>The word with you is: "It is over!"
    <br>- And who said, "It is over!"?
    <br>- Jesus!
    <br>- And when Jesus says, "It is over!"
    <br>- It is over!
    <br>So take it. Continue to meditate over this.
    <br>When you hear anything strange like the message we preached today -
    <br>that you don't need to look far to find Him, you do not lie.
    <br>You don't need to look far.
    <br>Ah, you see it.
    <br>You look here and see economic oppression.
    <br>Here political oppression.
    <br>Everywhere religios oppression. So everywhere.
    <br>How do we react to this matter?
    <br>It is not that oppression now, but the way you react to it; sometimes, our reaction can lead to sin.
    <br>Can lead to what?
    <br>Sin.
    <br>When you say, "Oh, why are you doing this?
    <br>You are committing sin again.
    <br>You believe you are doing the right thing whereas you are committing sin.
    <br>Because the way you react to an issue matters.
    <br>Not that issue but the manner you react to it matters.
    <br>Let us be known as people who are for good, not just against the bad.
    <br>So take that message home.
    <br>This is my message to you today.
    <br>I want to leave you by saying, "It is over!"
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Continue to meditate this: "It is over!"
    <br>That sickness, disease, affliction, setback, stagnation, limitation, failure, nightmares - it is over!
    <br>I can´t hear you!
    <br>[It is over!]
    <br>What the Lord has done for me

    <br>That is just the beginning.
    <br>What you have said will not come back to your mouth.
    <br>He shall do it; it shall happen!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Right now for your nation. Whatever you have as a symbol or contact, stretch it.
    <br>Ask the Lord, the Redeemer to intercede in the affairs of your nation.
    <br>He's the Redeemer.
    <br>Open your lips and commit your nation.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Commit your nation.
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Commit your leader, the economy of your nation, the political situation of your nation.
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>For those of us who are coming for the first time:
    <br>You have seen that Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>You have seen what you have read, what you have studied in the Bible.
    <br>You can see the presence of Jesus in His Word, Spirit and all other.
    <br>So right now, you want to give your life and those who are here today to rededicate themselves.
    <br>Say after me: Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood
    <br>and make me Your channel, 
    <br>Your channel of love,
    <br>Make me Your channel,
    <br>Your channel of pardon.
    <br>Make me Your channel,
    <br>Your channel of forgiveness.
    <br>Make me Your channel,
    <br>Your channel of purity.
    <br>Make me Your channel, Lord,
    <br>Your channel of shining light.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can´t hear you..
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Remember, you asked for a channel of God. You are a channel of God.
    <br>A channel of love - as you are going, there is hate everywhere.
    <br>Injustice, hatred and you are a channel of God, a channel of love.
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Your neighbour can be those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Your neighbour can be your enemies - love them all.
    <br>Channel of shining light.
    <br>Out there, there is darkness and you are a shining light.
    <br>Don´t forget your promise to God: You are a channel.
    <br>I pray you remain a channel of God where there is darkness.
    <br>Where there is injury, you remain a channel of pardon.
    <br>Where there is sin, you remain a channel of forgiveness.
    <br>Where there is hate, you remain a channel of love.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can´t hear you..
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Halleluyah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don´t forget whom you are.
    <br>I said, don´t forget whom you are.
    <br>There is an area that you have to take home.
    <br>We are going to make mistakes because there is no one righteous, not even one.
    <br>When you do, you must think about what you did.
    <br>That is, to examine your life.
    <br>It's a good thing.
    <br>Reflect and ask yourself, "Is this the kind of person I want to be?
    <br>A liar? A thief? A killer?"
    <br>Whatever you might have done, ask and examine yourself.
    <br>That is the special gift given to you, we call it 'discretion'.
    <br>"Oh no, this is not right. This is right."
    <br>Don't forget that.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Examine yourself.
    <br>"Examine your life - it's a good thing".
    <br>I can´t hear you..
    <br>[Examine your life - it's a good thing.]
    <br>Before you pray, when you wake up in the morning,
    <br>before you offer prayer to God, because God is God of justice,
    <br>sit down and examine your life.
    <br>Where you missed the mark - when you are not right and when you are right.
    <br>So that you can say, "Ah, I'm sorry, this is what I have done. I promised and I failed".
    <br>After that, you can now say, "Jesus! My Lord Jesus!"
    <br>If you don't examine your life before you pray, you are not praying to God -
    <br>you are praying to yourself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you have not examined yourself before you pray,
    <br>you are praying of yourself; you are saying words, not praying prayers.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning, before you pray, sit on your bed and
    <br>examine yourself, "What have I done? What happened?
    <br>This man promised me; I promised this one and failed. Oh, Lord Jesus".
    <br>You say to yourself, "I'm sorry" before you begin to pray.
    <br>That will guide you what to pray for.
    <br>You need a guide to pray.
    <br>If you don't have a guide to pray and you just wake up - whom are you praying to?
    <br>So please, thank you very much.
