  <p>    
    <br>There is a woman there - you put on red, fat.
    <br>This is an attack - bedwetting.
    <br>Such a young woman. Please, come; it is an attack.
    <br>You are fat.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>It is an attack; this is not how you were born.
    <br>Non-stop.
    <br>But it is okay; Jesus loves you.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>This is the woman I said is bedwetting.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>It is an attack.
    <br>My name is Ramat Mercy Emeka Mba.
    <br>The man of God prophesied to me over the issue of my bedwetting,
    <br>and this problem has been lingering in my heart.
    <br>I don't know who to cry to or who to talk to.
    <br>I cry every night in my room.
    <br>You only cry in the night?
    <br>I cry in the day; cry in the night.
    <br>You are just saying it now.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>What you first said is that you cry in the night.
    <br>What of the day?
    <br>I will cry in the room; I will not come out to cry, Man of God,
    <br>and it has been disturbing me.
    <br>I don't know who to cry to.
    <br>Okay, it's alright. Don't worry.
    <br>- So, you know Jesus?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- There is a solution, okay?
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>- Where is your husband?
    <br>- He is here.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come.
    <br>You don't want to be proud of your wife because she is a bedwetter?
    <br>No, I'm proud of her.
    <br>When you saw your wife coming out, why did you not run out?
    <br>Go and carry your wife.
    <br>Nobody will help you. Carry her!
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Look, you have an addiction and poverty is fighting you.
    <br>It is true, Man of God.
    <br>Poverty is fighting you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I'm healed!
    <br>See your wife now!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I'm healed!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Ramat Mercy Emeka Mba.
    <br>This is my husband - my lovely husband.
    <br>Mrs Ramat Mercy Emeka Mby & Husband
    <br>Delivered From Bedwetting Through Prophecy
    <br>The man of God prophesied that there is a woman here, fat.
    <br>That she should come out. She has the spirit of bedwetting.
    <br>That it is an attack; she should come out.
    <br>I knew it was my case and I run out.
    <br>I said, "I'm here. It is true, Man of God".
    <br>The prophecy is true - thousand percent true.
    <br>I thank God for that prophecy. If not, I don't know where I would be now
    <br>because it is a very serious thing for you to see a woman, mother, to bedwet.
    <br>A very serious story.
    <br>Being a mother bedwetting - look at my children by my side.
    <br>I would be in my room; I would be with my husband.
    <br>When that thing happened, I would be crying, just as I was saying.
    <br>I would be crying in the night, "What is happening to me?"
    <br>I have children that are supposed to bedwet.
    <br>I would then carry them and say, "Don't do this".
    <br>As an adult, am I to be doing this?
    <br>It was a very serious story.
    <br>This bedwetting started when I got married.
    <br>It is more than ten years now - ten good years.
    <br>When this happened in the night, I would take the mattress outside in the morning.
    <br>My workers would say, "Ah, is it yours or from your house?"
    <br>I would not even know what to say; I would be too ashamed to tell them this or that
    <br>because it was a very shameful thing.
    <br>I didn't know what to do. I would say, "Yes, it was my kids".
    <br>I had to lie.
    <br>I would go inside and start crying again.
    <br>My husband would say, "Why are you crying? Leave it. God will do it.
    <br>You know the God we are worshipping.
    <br>We are members; we will be able to have our healing.
    <br>At the right time of God, you will be healed".
    <br>He always supported me.
    <br>He always stood by me - seriously, what would I have done?
    <br>I never used to go out; there would be occasions where they said, "Can we go?"
    <br>I would say, "No, I can't".
    <br>Because if I went or travelled, this might disgrace me.
    <br>I would be ashamed so I wouldn't go.
    <br>Even one day, I went to my uncle's wedding and it happened again.
    <br>I said, "Ha. What is happening to me?"
    <br>So I kept on crying; crying was the only solution.
    <br>He would say, "Don't cry".
    <br>It really affected my life.
    <br>I used to have a dream where I would see a man climbing on top of me - giant.
    <br>I said, "Who are you? You are not my husband!"
    <br>I would be pushing him.
    <br>He would be strangling me by the neck and say, "Lie down".
    <br>I would lie down and say, "Who is this?"
    <br>At the end, I would wake up from that dream - bedwetting again.
    <br>Immediately Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me and touched me,
    <br>I felt something heavy removed from my heart.
    <br>I am fat - you can see that I'm fat - and I feel light.
    <br>Formerly, I would be like a stone.
    <br>I used to say, "What kind of heaviness is this? Am I the only fat person in this world?
    <br>Am I the only one that is fat?"
    <br>Immediately after that touch, the heaviness was removed from my heart.
    <br>I was light - light till now.
    <br>Mrs Ramat Mercy Emeka Mby & Husband
    <br>Delivered From Bedwetting Through Prophecy
    <br>Ever since then, my brothers and sisters, I'm sleeping now like a baby.
    <br>If I drink water now, I can take four bottles of water.
    <br>I even used to test; I drank a lot of water and then go to sleep.
    <br>When I sleep - no more!
    <br>My people, no more! Help me to thank God!
    <br>I am no more bedwetting.
    <br>People that used to see me bedwetting, "This fat woman..." - I'm no more bedwetting!
    <br>I'm like a new-born baby now.
    <br>I thank God for what Jesus has done for me.
    <br>I dreamt the day before yesterday.
    <br>I saw a giant man - black - and a white man.
    <br>The white one was pursuing the other one.
    <br>Then I took a knife and said, "You have come again" and then stabbed the black one.
    <br>Then I woke up and I was okay.
    <br>I'm delivered.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So that is to confirm that that evil spirit, the demon responsible for that bedwetting
    <br>was cast out through the prayer and the dream was just a spiritual confirmation
    <br>of what Jesus Christ had done.
    <br>It is a wonderful thing. I'm delivered.
    <br>It was not an easy thing.
    <br>I'm delivered; I'm saved.
    <br>I thank our daddy in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for seeing me out of my big problem.
    <br>Big one for an adult to bedwet!
    <br>I thank God for him.
    <br>May God give him a long life and prosperity!
    <br>Give him more and more wisdom!
    <br>Mrs Ramat Mercy Emeka Mby & Husband
    <br>Delivered From Bedwetting Through Prophecy
    <br>Madam, at the end of the prophecy, the man of God said something concerning your husband.
    <br>What did he say about your husband and what can you say concerning that?
    <br>You could all see towards the end of it...
    <br>When they say, "Let's attack the home so that we cannot see the home progress"...
    <br>He prophesied, "Can't you come out for your wife or are you ashamed?"
    <br>He came out and said, "No".
    <br>He said, "You are addicted to drugs and smoking".
    <br>It is perfectly true.
    <br>I said, "He, is it only me that God loves in this church?"
    <br>I was so happy.
    <br>The addiction was severe.
    <br>Sometimes we took a car and he would say, "Take. Give me drugs".
    <br>Before I would look for money again, he would go and collect it.
    <br>We would be fighting.
    <br>Even the day before we came here, he almost burnt down the room.
    <br>I said, "God, help me. It can't happen like this.
    <br>He is a father; I'm a mother. Why all this?"
    <br>I thank God that the man of God also delivered him.
    <br>For one week now, we are like a new creation.
    <br>Help me to thank God! Help me to thank Jesus!
    <br>No more drugs, no more any trouble again!
    <br>We are still coming back for more testimonies.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Anthony Mba.
    <br>I came from Abuja.
    <br>This is my lovely wife.
    <br>Last week during the course of the service, the man of God gave a prophecy concerning my family.
    <br>First, he prophesied about my wife who had this problem of bedwetting.
    <br>True, people of God. It has not been easy for us as a family.
    <br>You people know how it is when your wife wakes up in the middle of the night crying
    <br>that she has bedwetted again.
    <br>We tried medical solution, going to hospitals.
    <br>They said she has diabetes.
    <br>But we knew it was not normal.
    <br>As God would have it, last week, the man of God prophesied concerning her.
    <br>Since last week till now, my wife is free from the spirit of bedwetting.
    <br>Also, in the course of the prophecy, the man of God prophesied about me.
    <br>I had this addiction to smoking.
    <br>I smoked marihuana and cigarettes.
    <br>Since my childhood days, I had been addicted to that.
    <br>I had tried on my own to stop but it was not easy.
    <br>I thank God for the prophecy of the man of God.
    <br>From last week till now, the urge is no longer there again.
    <br>I thank God for everything.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Wow. Glory be to God Almighty. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>So it is a double testimony.
    <br>Not only was your wife delivered from bedwetting, you too were delivered from that drug addiction.
    <br>Brother, could you give us an idea of how serious this addiction was before,
    <br>how it really destroyed your life.
    <br>I didn't even know myself; I didn't know what just came over me.
    <br>I can't even explain it.
    <br>All I know is that I was very addicted to these things on a daily basis.
    <br>I didn't understand what was happening.
    <br>I just thank God that since last week, I have been free.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give glory to our Lord Jesus Christ for this wonderful testimony
    <br>Madam, we also understand that some of your family members are here
    <br>to rejoice with you for this testimony.
    <br>We would also like to invite some of your family members to come forward
    <br>as it is such a huge testimony for what Jesus has done in the life of our mother,
    <br>setting her free from ten years of that affliction of bedwetting.
    <br>as well as our brother delivered from that drug addiction.
    <br>My name is Saadatu Ibrahim. This is my sister.
    <br>I came with her from Abuja to testify to what God has done in her life.
    <br>It has not been easy but glory be to God, she is delivered.
    <br>Thanks be to God.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>It is wonderful that the family has come to join our sister to share the testimony.
    <br>My word of advice to people:
    <br>You are all sitting in this arena of liberty.
    <br>As He healed me, located me and prophesied to me,
    <br>it will be the same for you, in Jesus' name!
    <br>If you have a problem in your body, don't say that the doctor can do it.
    <br>Doctors can only treat but God heals.
    <br>As the man of God has healed me, everyone will be located and healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>That is my advice. And don't hide a problem within you,
    <br>become ashamed and not come out.
    <br>When I heard it, I ran out because I knew it was my problem.
    <br>So if you hear yours, don't say, I'm feeling shy. I won't come out.
    <br>I will not do this".
    <br>Come out! That devil will be put to shame!
    <br>He has been put to shame in my life.
    <br>So you will put him to shame in yours.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Mrs Ramat Mercy Emeka Mby & Husband
    <br>Delivered From Bedwetting Through Prophecy
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty! We thank God for this wonderful testimony.
    <br>We pray that God will give the grace to this family
    <br>to continue to make the Word of God the standard for your lives
    <br>and we believe the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
