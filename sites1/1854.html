  <p>    
    <br>My name is Jaco van der Westhuyzen.
    <br>I am a Springbok rugby player.
    <br>I played for the Mpumalanga Pumas, and earlier in the season, I was chosen to play for South Africa.
    <br>A squad had been chosen to go overseas and I got injured.
    <br>I tore my posterior cruciate ligament and as a result, I developed chronic osteitis pubis in my groin.
    <br>Osteitis pubis is a groin injury; it affects your pelvis - your pubic bone.
    <br>Your pubic bone starts to shift. It's not as stable as it's supposed to be.
    <br>Your stabilisers become weak, and as a result, you struggle to run
    <br>and you can't do things at full pace.
    <br>I believe when the Holy Spirit works through Prophet Joshua that I will be healed instantly.
    <br>Jaco van der Westhuyzen, a professional Springbok rugby player, is forced to wear a leg brace
    <br>due to a sports-related injury.
    <br>Without this brace, he cannot walk because of the knee and groin injury he sustained.
    <br>Now he is standing in the prayer line, waiting to receive prayer for the problem of knee injury,
    <br>groin injury, hernia and career failure.
    <br>Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua offering prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit
    <br>to transform his life from sickness to health.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The man of God says, "I am not the healer, I know the Healer. His name is Jesus Christ."
    <br>Mr van der Westhuyzen is now removing the brace.
    <br>This has been the only solution medical practitioners could offer him, but it has been no solution.
    <br>God is using His anointed servant as a channel of healing where there is affliction.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua stretches forth his leg as a point of contact,
    <br>God uses our faculties to express Himself to others.
    <br>Be healed, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>As a result of the prayer of the man of God, Jaco is now bending his knees under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Doing what he could not do before, he is now exercising his legs, as instructed by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Our God, Jesus Christ, is the miracle provider.
    <br>He has awesome miracles in store for you; just give Him a chance to prove it.
    <br>Glory be to God, Mr van der Westhuyzen is now walking, something that moments ago wasn't possible.
    <br>He is now running, proving that he has been perfectly and completely healed.
    <br>No more pain, no more suffering; Jesus Christ has eliminated his sorrow and hardship.
    <br>Hallelujah! When Jesus says yes, no one can say no.
    <br>Our God, Jehovah Jireh, makes impossibilities possible.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Jesus, thank You!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet!
    <br>Hallelujah! My name is Jaco van der Westhuyzen; I am a professional rugby player.
    <br>I tore my ligament in my knee - my posterior cruciate ligament -
    <br>and that caused me to be in this brace for a long time.
    <br>I came here to Lagos, Nigeria, to The SCOAN.
    <br>I came here for Prophet T.B. Joshua to pray for me - for the Holy Spirit to heal me.
    <br>Prophet Joshua prayed for me, I took the brace off and I can move my leg now - what I couldn't do before.
    <br>There is no pain!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel! Praise the Lord!
    <br>It was necessary for me to go for an operation, and it would have cost a lot of money.
    <br>But Prophet Joshua, through the Holy Spirit, healed me - and it didn't cost me a cent!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My promise to God is to sin no more.
    <br>After our Lord Jesus Christ used the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>to heal Jaco van der Westhuyzen, a professional rugby player, he left for his country
    <br>and went back to the same hospital, where he was tested and confirmed to be healed of the knee injury
    <br>that prevented him from playing rugby.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Here we see Mr Jaco van der Westhuyzen with a national South African newspaper
    <br>that carries his miraculous testimony, headlined: Look for yourself, my knee is healed!
    <br>There was evidence then, there is evidence now: miracles in His name.
    <br>My name is Jaco van der Westhuyzen. I am a professional rugby player.
    <br>Earlier in the season, I hurt my knee.
    <br>I tore my posterior cruciate ligament; it is a ligament in the knee.
    <br>After that, I couldn't run, jog or play anymore.
    <br>Then I heard about Prophet T.B. Joshua in The SCOAN.
    <br>I had a friend back home that had a brain tumour and he was healed, and then I started believing.
    <br>I came here and, as you saw, the prophet prayed for me and I started running.
    <br>From that moment on, I was healed - I was totally healed.
    <br>I went back.
    <br>I had been to a couple of specialists and doctors, and they had said to me I could not play anymore.
    <br>After the healing, I went back to show them that I was healed.
    <br>I would like to show you. It was in the newspaper there.
    <br>That is me in the hospital and that is the specialist.
    <br>When I went back to her, she couldn't believe what happened to my knee.
    <br>I've never experienced anything like this before.
    <br>It's amazing how God works through the prophet.
    <br>It's brilliant. It was awesome.
    <br>You cannot leave here with a sickness and not be healed; it's impossible.
    <br>Before coming to Prophet Joshua, I couldn't move my leg like this.
    <br>Like you saw with the brace I wore, I could only keep it straight; I couldn't do this.
    <br>But as you can see now, there is nothing wrong - no pain whatsoever!
    <br>I can run! I can do anything!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>After Jesus Christ healed him, through the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, in the year 2000,
    <br>Mr Jaco van der Westhuizen went back to the same hospital and the same doctor,
    <br>and went through a series of medical tests.
    <br>All tests and X-rays confirmed that his ligament was perfectly healed.
    <br>The doctors could not believe it or explain it.
    <br>Ever since his healing, in August 2000, he has been testifying around the world
    <br>about the healing he received in The SCOAN, Lagos, Nigeria, through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Praise the Lord! Now that you have been healed, what is your promise to God Almighty?
    <br>My promise to God is to sin no more.
    <br>This is the UK Sport Magazine of the Year - The Observer Sport Monthly.
    <br>Not only a top national newspaper in the UK, but also respected worldwide.
    <br>In its February 2004 edition, Mr Jaco van der Westhuyzen was interviewed
    <br>concerning his miraculous healing.
    <br>Mr Jaco van der Westhuyzen explained how he came to find himself in The SCOAN, Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>He came to The Synagogue, was healed and was amazed at what he saw.
    <br>News about his healing spread across South Africa and the whole world.
    <br>It is God's will for you and I to prosper in all ways,
    <br>as Jaco van der Westhuyzen's current medical reports and career stats prove.
    <br>Since his healing, he has become a rugby giant and has made a great impact all over the world.
    <br>He has worn the 'Bok's jersey many times, played full back against England and the All Blacks
    <br>in the 2003 World Cup, and was 2003's South African Super 12 Player of the Season.
