  <p>    
    <br>There is a man with a charm -
    <br>it is in your pocket.
    <br>You just removed it from your hand and put it in your pocket.
    <br>Will you come out?
    <br>Ok, come out.
    <br>He has a charm. He took it from his hand and put it in his pocket.
    <br>Please come out with it.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Those the prophecy concerns are still coming forward to honour the word of prophecy from the man of God.
    <br>Ok, this is a charm.
    <br>Man of God, I am Sylvester from Delta State.
    <br>I am the one using this charm to dupe people.
    <br>I collected money from people with this charm.
    <br>When I entered this church, I put this charm in my pocket.
    <br>I never knew you would call me out.
    <br>When you called me I was so surprised and shocked, so I came out immediately.
    <br>Please, man of God, deliver me!
    <br>I don't want to commit fraud any longer. That is the reason why I came.
    <br>Please, man of God, deliver me!
    <br>We have listened to the young man.
    <br>He says he is the one the man of God prophesied about,
    <br>that there is a young man here that came with a charm today
    <br>and he removed the charm from his hand and put it in his pocket.
    <br>And he has been using this ring charm to defraud people.
    <br>And he says that he does not want to defraud people anymore.
    <br>He wants God Almighty to deliver him.
    <br>Whenever I wanted to steal money from someone I would put these rings on my fingers,
    <br>and whatever I wanted I would tell the person.
    <br>But for some time now, I don't want to use it again.
    <br>I don't feel good using it anymore -
    <br>I feel it is not good.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN
    <br>I didn't want the charm on my fingers, so I put it in my pocket.
    <br>I was so surprised and shocked that he called me out unexpectedly that
    <br>someone is here who has a ring charm in his hand that he put in his pocket.
    <br>I confirm that this is me.
    <br>I am the rightful person because that is what I did.
    <br>It was right on my hand and then I removed it and put it in my pocket.
    <br>Please, man of God, deliver me!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>I am Sylvester from Delta State.
    <br>I am here to confirm the prophecy given to me by the man of God last week Sunday during the mass prayer.
    <br>During the mass prayer the man of God, Senior Prophet TB Joshua, prophesied to me that
    <br>there is a young boy over there with a ring and he later put it in his pocket -
    <br>which I confirm to be true.
    <br>Can you tell us exactly what the man of God described that you were having in your hand,
    <br>and you later put in your pocket?
    <br>A ring charm which I had in my hand and later put in my pocket.
    <br>And during the mass prayer the man of God prophesied that there is a young boy over there.
    <br>You have a ring charm and you placed it in your pocket.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true because I am the one.
    <br>I am a fraudster; I used to defraud people.
    <br>I went to a witchdoctor and he prepared the charm for me.
    <br>Whenever I wanted to take money from my victims
    <br>I would put the ring on and also some other items given to me by the witchdoctor.
    <br>I have been using this charm for a while now,
    <br>and I mostly used to defraud women through Facebook - social media.
    <br>I would meet them and ask for a relationship with them.
    <br>As long as they wanted to get married to me then I would start bringing up some issues,
    <br>and later I would ask her for money.
    <br>You know the man of God prophesied about a charm that you had in your possession.
    <br>Can you explain to us, after communicating with your victims through social media,
    <br>how did you use this charm - this ring - to dupe these people?
    <br>Whenever I wanted to ask my victim for money I put the ring in my hand and I placed the other liquid on my tongue.
    <br>Whatever I needed, I would just tell the person straight -
    <br>"I need $5 000",
    <br>"I need $10 000".
    <br>And if the person was not ready to comply,
    <br>because of the power in the ring and that of the one I had placed on my tongue,
    <br>the person would comply instantly.
    <br>I normally communicated with them through calls. I had their contacts.
    <br>And sometimes, especially while shouting at each other on social media - Facebook.
    <br>So that means the evil power in that ring you were holding is what you used to communicate with your victims,
    <br>and whatever you demanded from them, as you said, they would surely comply.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you tell us the value of the money you duped people out of,
    <br>and how many people you have defrauded through social media?
    <br>I have defrauded a lot of people.
    <br>Most times I asked for $10 000, $20 000, $5 000 from different people in different locations internationally.
    <br>Ever since I received the prophecy from the man of God I feel so free.
    <br>I don't feel like defrauding people any longer.
    <br>I have a free spirit.
    <br>I don't have the thought of going to social media or any other Internet sites to look for clients.
    <br>I am free and I know that this prophecy has brought victory in my life.
    <br>Give glory to God. Shall we put our hands together once again for Jesus.
    <br>The advice I have for fraudsters is that they have to stop and give their lives to Christ,
    <br>because there is nothing more than God. God's own gift is the best.
    <br>Defrauding people is not what someone can do and benefit from it - there is no gain doing it.
    <br>Because all the money I got from it is vanity; it is of no use - going to parties, drinking, riches etc.
    <br>My advice to fraudsters is that they have to stop and seek deliverance so that God can set them free.
    <br>We know that he is in the best position to advise those who are still in this kind of activity,
    <br>that they should desist from it and give their life to Christ.
    <br>We thank you for that advice, which we know will go a long way to educate those who are still into this act
    <br>and bring them forward for their own deliverance.
    <br>We want to advise you that God Almighty,
    <br>through the power of prophecy given by the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua, has delivered you and set you free.
    <br>Make sure you stay true to the Word of God,
    <br>making His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>And we know that that Word of God will continue to set you on the good route to the good life. Thank you very much.
    <br>Once again let us put our hands together for Jesus.
