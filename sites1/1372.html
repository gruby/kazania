    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Healed Of Sleep Apnea In Jesus' Name
    <br>I am free.
    <br>I can breath well.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Teddy Binene.
    <br>I come from America.
    <br>My country of origin is DRC Congo.
    <br>I am 58 years old.
    <br>Can you tell us what was the exact problem that brought you to The SCOAN?
    <br>I came because I used a CPAP machine, had chest pain and problems breathing.
    <br>I had this for 11 years.
    <br>The problem started when my my dad gave me a charm.
    <br>He gave me a charm and put it in my chest.
    <br>It gave me the spirit of stealing.
    <br>I started selling fake gold to people.
    <br>When I started doing that, I started seeing problems.
    <br>One day, I slept and had a dream.
    <br>In that dream, I saw myself dead and lying on the floor.
    <br>I heard a voice tell me, "If you leave your body down there, it's going to rot.
    <br>Go fast and buy a coffin so you can put your body inside and bury your body."
    <br>I went and bought my own coffin, came back and put my body in the coffin.
    <br>I stood on the road, looking for transportation to take me to the graveyard.
    <br>When I was standing on the road, I tried to stop cars but they would not stop.
    <br>Then, I just saw a big truck.
    <br>The road was under construction.
    <br>The truck stopped, I put my coffin in the truck and then went to the front and sat with the driver.
    <br>We started going to the graveyard.
    <br>When we got to the graveyard, I told the driver and he stopped.
    <br>I took my coffin and went into the graveyard.
    <br>I opened one tomb and found a body; I opened another tomb and found a body.
    <br>Then I heard a voice say, "Do you see that big cross in the middle of the cemetery?
    <br>The owner of that tomb is not there; he is already gone. Go and put your coffin there."
    <br>When I got there, I opened it and found that the tomb was empty.
    <br>I took my coffin to put it inside and I woke up.
    <br>After that, the sickness started developing.
    <br>My dad told me, "Don't worry, my son.
    <br>We, witchdoctors, know how to bewitch people but we don't know how to cure them.
    <br>There is a man of God, a real man of God, who will cure you."
    <br>One day I was in my house and just opened a channel on YouTube.
    <br>I saw Emmanuel TV and I saw T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He said, "Distance is not a barrier; you can pray with me."
    <br>I just touched my TV and three days later, I saw the place my father put the charm open up
    <br>and the charm came out.
    <br>Man Breaks Down In Tears During TOUCHING TESTIMONY!!!
    <br>When I came here, the man of God touched me and prayed for me.
    <br>I felt something in my chest go out.
    <br>I started breathing and my body felt very light.
    <br>I was delivered through the man of God.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
    <br>Now, before you tell us the changes you are seeing in your body after the prayer;
    <br>we can see some drugs there.
    <br>What do you have to say about those drugs?
    <br>Even when I was taking this drug, I didn't feel the way I feel now.
    <br>Even when I was using this machine, it was just a problem.
    <br>The real solution comes from God; all of this is nothing.
    <br>Tell us, after the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua touched you,
    <br>as we saw a moment ago on the screen of the TV,
    <br>what are the changes you have seen in your life from then till now?
    <br>I was becoming weaker; I was suffering from headaches.
    <br>I had problems and was spending money on this but now, I am light.
    <br>I am good; I sleep like a baby.
    <br>I don't have any problems and I no longer take these drugs.
    <br>Can you breathe in and out and tell us your condition?
    <br>- How do you feel now?
    <br>- I am very good.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
    <br>Now that you are set free through the power of God,
    <br>what do you want to do with this machine and the drugs?
    <br>This is nothing to me.
    <br>This is nothing to me; I can't use it anymore.
    <br>To the glory of God, you heard it from the man;
    <br>he has realised that the Lord is good and he is no longer make use of this breathing machine,
    <br>the drugs are no longer for him, he doesn't need them anymore.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
    <br>Based on your past experience, having this sleep apnea for 11 horrible years,
    <br>you couldn't breathe by yourself, you couldn't sleep, those drugs couldn't help you,
    <br>and also based on your experience with what your father inserted in your body,
    <br>and the Spirit of God removed it through watching Emmanuel TV:
    <br>What word of advice do you have for all who are listening to you?
    <br>God is here!
    <br>Man Breaks Down In Tears During TOUCHING TESTIMONY!!!
    <br>God is here; anyone who has problems, come with your problems here.
    <br>God is here!
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ?
    <br>That is an emotional expression of tears of joy,
    <br>for you to know that he has experienced a lot,
    <br>finding himself in a deep mess of terrible sickness and disease,
    <br>something that he never expected that it would go like that.
    <br>After he has spent huge amount of money, all to no avail,
    <br>it went away within a twinkle of an eye.
    <br>Only Jesus Christ can justly do it.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for setting you free
    <br>and we pray as you go and make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>we pray that your miracle will remain permanent.
    <br>And have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God?
