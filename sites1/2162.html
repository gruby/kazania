    <br>Let's pray for the viewers.
    <br>If the Son of God forgives you, you are delivered from every reproach.
    <br>You are delivered from every reproach, every shame!
    <br>Whatever medium, whatever means that has been used to connect you -
    <br>be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be disconnected, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever affliction -
    <br>be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Business failure - be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Whatever injustice - here is justice!
    <br>Marital problems, business failure -
    <br>when Jesus says yes, no one can say no!
    <br>Here is freedom, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Here is healing, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, now we are delivered!
    <br>Ask God to help you.
    <br>Ask God to make a way where there is no way,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>When Jesus says yes, no one can say no!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Believe you are set free!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
