  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>What a privilege it is to worship God in the beauty of His holiness!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>those who praise God with all their hearts here on earth will feel at home in Heaven."
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>I would like to begin today's message with a short life experience.
    <br>As they say, experience is the best teacher.
    <br>This is an experience that I will never forget in my life.
    <br>It was many many years ago when I was here at The SCOAN.
    <br>One day I had the opportunity of going to the prayer mountain,
    <br>which I'm sure most of you are aware of.
    <br>It's a beautiful place of nature which is set aside for prayer and reflection.
    <br>This was many years ago; I went there and I was there praying, in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>And where I was, at a distance, far away
    <br>I just saw someone on their knees and they were praying fervently, engaged with God.
    <br>I didn't recognize the person but that person was praying on their knees.
    <br>I drew a little bit closer and then I realised who it was.
    <br>It was Prophet T.B. Joshua on his knees before his creator in prayer.
    <br>That scene, that site touched my heart.
    <br>I remembered what the Bible says in Matthew 6:6 -
    <br>you can take your time to read it.
    <br>The Scripture there clearly tells us that the results which everyone sees
    <br>is just an overflow of the relationship that no one sees.
    <br>And later that very same day, when I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua, he called me -
    <br>I will never forget this -
    <br>he said, "I want to show you something."
    <br>He had seen that I saw in that mode of prayer.
    <br>He was just wearing shorts and he pulled up his shorts and showed me his knees.
    <br>The skin on his knees was thick, hard.
    <br>If you used a knife to cut, no blood would come out.
    <br>And he said the following words,
    <br>"This is the secret of my life. I live my life on my knees."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, I live my life on my knees."
    <br>He went further, he then said, "This doesn't mean that physically I'm all the time on my knees,
    <br>but my heart is always on its knees before God."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, live your life on your knees."
    <br>This is what I want to talk about today - prayer.
    <br>Prayer is not merely saying words.
    <br>Prayer is a relationship that exists between God and His children.
    <br>Let me put it like this:
    <br>Communion with Christ springs from union with Christ.
    <br>This simply means prayer is a way of life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, prayer is a way of life."
    <br>OK, let me try and be practical.
    <br>What do I mean by this?
    <br>I mean, live and pray.
    <br>Walk and pray.
    <br>Eat and pray.
    <br>Jump and pray.
    <br>Go to work and pray.
    <br>Pick your phone, "Hello, how are you?" and pray.
    <br>Greet your neighbour, "How are you?" and pray.
    <br>Do everything and pray.
    <br>This is what one life for Christ - I mean, life in Christ - is all about.
    <br>Walk and pray.
    <br>Greet and pray.
    <br>Sleep and pray.
    <br>Sit down and pray.
    <br>Stand up and pray.
    <br>Do everything and pray.
    <br>Let's talk to ourselves.
    <br>The problem we have today is that we don't see prayer as a standard for our lives.
    <br>Let me put it like this:
    <br>We don't see God as the standard for life; we only see Him as a Helper in times of trouble.
    <br>"Lord, I'm sick. Heal me. God, I'm poor. Bless me.
    <br>Lord, my marriage is about to crash. Restore me."
    <br>We don't see God as the standard for life; we only see Him as a Helper in times of trouble.
    <br>We see faith as a panic button that we push only in times of trouble.
    <br>That is the reason we have certain occasions for prayer at times of specific need.
    <br>If we are sincere, for most of us that are here today - the reason we are here is trouble.
    <br>Am I right?
    <br>If we are sincere, it is trouble that brought us here;
    <br>different kinds of trouble, "My business is not moving. My wife is misbehaving.
    <br>My husband has a spirit of addiction." - trouble!
    <br>So I'm here to let you know today a very simple but profound principle:
    <br>The heart of prayer is prayer from the heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, the heart of prayer is prayer from the heart."
    <br>This will lead us to the title of today's message:
    <br>THE HEART OF PRAYER
    <br>Turn with me to the Book of Ephesians chapter 6.
    <br>I would encourage you, when you get home to read the entire chapter,
    <br>but I'm going to pick from verse 18.
    <br>And the Bible says this:
    <br>"And pray in the Spirit on all occasions..."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "All occasions."
    <br>It doesn't say "some occasions", it doesn't say "when there is no money in the pocket",
    <br>it doesn't say "when there is no food on the table",
    <br>it doesn't say "when trouble strikes the business", it says:
    <br>"Pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.
    <br>With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord's people."
    <br>Now we quickly go to another very well known verse, 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.
    <br>I will read from verses 16-18.
    <br>The Scripture says this:
    <br>"Rejoice always,
    <br>pray continually..."
    <br>Some versions say, "Pray without ceasing."
    <br>"... pray continually,
    <br>give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
    <br>These Scriptures clearly tell us we should pray without ceasing,
    <br>pray on all occasions, pray continually.
    <br>But ask yourself this question:
    <br>If you pray only with your lips, can you pray without ceasing?
    <br>Just with your mouth, "Lord Jesus Christ! Son of David, have mercy on me.
    <br>Bless my home. Bless my family..."
    <br>You will not be able to continue praying with your lips without ceasing.
    <br>You cannot pray with your body without ceasing, engaging your body in prayer;
    <br>hot prayer, fire prayer - you will get tired soon.
    <br>But the Scripture says, "Pray without ceasing."
    <br>What is it referring to?
    <br>Your heart.
    <br>The prayer of the lips should just be an overflow of the prayer from the heart.
    <br>This is what the Bible means by, "Pray without ceasing."
    <br>You have to engage your heart, keep your heart busy, take hold of your heart.
    <br>Do you know the reason why?
    <br>If you don't engage your heart, your heart will engage you.
    <br>What do I mean by saying, "Our hearts will engage us"?
    <br>Our hearts will engage us to think of our own interests rather than God's interests.
    <br>As we are sitting down right now, or our viewers around the world,
    <br>as you are watching Emmanuel TV right now;
    <br>for many of us, our hearts are going up and down,
    <br>"When will the service close? I have community meeting by 3 pm.
    <br>When is T.B. Joshua coming out?
    <br>Are you sure he will come out today?
    <br>Will he pray for me? I need prophecy.
    <br>If he doesn't prophecy to me, my problem is not solved.
    <br>Are you sure I will be healed? Are you really sure God will heal me?
    <br>Are you sure my marriage will be settled?
    <br>I need the restroom. Where is the usher?"
    <br>Different things going through our hearts and all of this is not the issue now.
    <br>As I am preaching to you, I should be praying, and as you are listening to me, you should be praying.
    <br>Engage your heart or your heart will engage you.
    <br>This is the reason why today you can be here sitting in the church service,
    <br>suddenly a text message can come in.
    <br>That text message can disorganize you and even cause you to leave the service.
    <br>Many people were supposed to be here today but they are not here because of circumstances,
    <br>situations, hardship - they didn't come to church.
    <br>This is the reason why you can be praying, if you just hear some bad news, you abandon the prayer.
    <br>You can be praying, you just receive an unpleasant message - your prayer is interrupted.
    <br>People of God,
    <br>prayer should flow naturally in our hearts the way blood flows naturally through our veins.
    <br>It shouldn't be according to circumstance or situation.
    <br>Our situation should not dictate the direction of our prayer.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>You can be sick and yet say, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>You can be poor and yet give praise to God.
    <br>Your situation should not dictate the direction of your prayer.
    <br>If circumstances are the reason for your prayer,
    <br>circumstances will be the reason to stop your prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>if circumstances are the reason for your prayer,
    <br>circumstances will be the reason to stop your prayer."
    <br>Maybe we don't understand exactly what I'm talking about.
    <br>If this apple is the reason for my prayer,
    <br>this apple and what happens to it will also be the reason to stop my prayer.
    <br>OK, I want God to give me this apple,
    <br>"God, please Lord, Son of David, give me this apple. I need this apple for my life.
    <br>I need this apple for my business. Lord Jesus Christ, release this apple unto my life."
    <br>If the apple does not come in the way you expect it or the time you expect it,
    <br>you are likely to get discouraged from praying.
    <br>Or by the time you hear that, "Oh, my brother here has some other apples. Let me try his own,
    <br>because this one is not coming in the way I expect it" - you adopt alternative apples.
    <br>On the contrary; if you are praying, "God, give me this apple" and the next moment the apple comes,
    <br>you will likely begin to relax and become lukewarm in your spiritual life.
    <br>If the apple is the reason for your prayer, the apple will be the reason to stop your prayer.
    <br>This is why as Christians - do you know what our principle should be?
    <br>Whether apple or not, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Whether He heals me or not, He is my Healer.
    <br>Whether He delivers me or not, He is my Deliverer.
    <br>Whether He rescues me or not, He is my Rescuer.
    <br>The Lord gives and the Lord takes away; blessed be the name of the Lord,
    <br>because our relationship with God is not based on this apple;
    <br>it is based on the Giver of the apple.
    <br>Take the same principle: If praise is the reason for your prayer,
    <br>praise will also be the reason to stop your prayer.
    <br>If you are sick in your body,
    <br>instead of asking God, "Heal me, Lord,"
    <br>you begin to praise Him in the midst of your sickness,
    <br>you will praise Him to the end.
    <br>I mean, you will be healed in God's time.
    <br>One can pray amiss but one can never praise amiss.
    <br>That is why you have to keep your heart busy praising God.
    <br>Engage your heart by talking to God.
    <br>Keep your heart busy with the things of God
    <br>or your heart will keep you busy with the things of the world.
    <br>Remember, our heart is the contact point for God.
    <br>It is His landing point.
    <br>It is where He will rest.
    <br>It is where He will reside - our heart.
    <br>The great thing God looks at and requires is the heart.
    <br>The success of your prayer depends on the state of your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>the success of your prayer depends on the state of your heart."
    <br>We cannot share in the spiritual privileges of His grace if our hearts are disturbed, troubled.
    <br>If your heart is troubled and you pray, you are praying of yourself.
    <br>It is what the Bible says in Psalm 66:18.
    <br>The Scripture says that sin regarded in the heart -
    <br>it could be offence, bitterness, resentment, revenge, pain of the past, unforgiveness -
    <br>sin regarded in the heart will ruin the success of your prayer.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>what is the state of your heart?"
    <br>Ask them again, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>what is the state of your heart?"
    <br>Viewers, what is the state of your heart?
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>Because your heart is the prayer room.
    <br>God listens to us when we pray and He responds in relation to the state of our hearts.
    <br>People of God, it is not the noise you make in prayer that produces the result,
    <br>it is not how loud you shout, "Lord Jesus Christ!" - that doesn't bring the results.
    <br>A man of prayer may not be a man of faith
    <br>because there is a difference between saying words and praying prayer.
    <br>One can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.
    <br>Let me give you a quick example I'm sure you have seen before.
    <br>When our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua, when he is encountering some unclean spirits
    <br>in the course of his ministration,
    <br>sometimes, when he encounters them from a distance,
    <br>he would just look at them and say, "Kai!" - and the demons fly.
    <br>Have you seen that?
    <br>Just like that.
    <br>The Pharisees and Sadducees of today will open the Bible and say, "Where is this written?"
    <br>But what they fail to realise is that demons don't respect grammar,
    <br>they respect power!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our grammar in prayer is usually just to impress men, not to reach God.
    <br>Whatever you say under the influence, under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>He will affect it.
    <br>The Holy Spirit cannot share with a heart that is full of offence, grudges, pain of the past.
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>When the state of your heart is of God - I mean, when your heart is at its best for God -
    <br>then nothing can separate you from God.
    <br>Why? Because you have seen Him as the standard for your life, not just a Helper in times of trouble.
    <br>When life is good, when life is bad, He will be with you.
    <br>He promised to never leave you nor forsake you.
    <br>When you are with God in truth and in faith,
    <br>whatever comes your way as a blessing or a trial will be what God allows.
    <br>Nothing can happen to you without God's knowledge if you are with Him in truth and faith.
    <br>If you are called by the Most High God,
    <br>from beginning to the end, your journey has been documented.
    <br>Nothing outside of your documentary can happen without God's knowledge.
    <br>Where then is there room for desperate prayers?
    <br>Why then should circumstances, situations be the reason to trigger our prayer?
    <br>Remember, the heart of prayer is prayer from the heart.
    <br>Children of God, in conclusion:
    <br>To live without prayer is the quickest way of throwing one's soul away -
    <br>I mean, throwing grace away.
    <br>If you know how much you need God,
    <br>you would realise that there is nothing too little for you to pray over.
    <br>You should acquire the habit of praying over little things as well as big things,
    <br>not just when you face a situation beyond your control that you run to God - no.
    <br>Walk and pray.
    <br>Eat and pray.
    <br>Watch the television and pray.
    <br>Browse the Internet and pray.
    <br>Do everything and pray.
    <br>If you walk and pray, you would not go to a place where Jesus would not be welcomed.
    <br>If you talk and pray, you would not engage in idle gossip or fill the air with empty words.
    <br>If you watch and pray,
    <br>you would not give attention to things that would violate your conscience or pollute your heart,
    <br>because God will never move us to pray for something that is not sanctioned by Scripture.
    <br>So I leave you with this final word of exhortation:
    <br>Please, pray constantly, pray without ceasing with hymns, spiritual songs,
    <br>making melodies in your heart to the Lord.
    <br>For when you engage your heart with God,
    <br>He will engage your life with peace, joy and good success.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
