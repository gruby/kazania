  <p>    
    <br>I would like to have your attention and viewers all over the world
    <br>for a special message of the Prophet for you and the whole world
    <br>which I'm going to read, in Jesus'name.
    <br>Our Prophet will not be able to be with us today but he is with us in the Spirit.
    <br>Special Message From Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>As you know and you have watched on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>he has been praying for you, praying for me and praying for the whole world.
    <br>You will remember the message he said that this year will be a very fearful year.
    <br>You can imagine the revelation he has.
    <br>He has to pray for God to give him wisdom on how to present this message to the world at large.
    <br>He has a message now for the nation Nigeria.
    <br>Message for Nigeria:
    <br>Nigeria should fast and pray this coming Thursday (17-01-19) and next upper Wednesday (23-01-19).
    <br>We should pray so that God should change the bad happenings he sees to good.
    <br>He is not permitted to say exactly what will happen.
    <br>So let us pray and fast Thursday and next upper Wednesday.
    <br>This revelation will be read to you the moment God gives him the wisdom to present it to you.
    <br>It will be given to you; it will be presented to you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Where God guides, He provides.
    <br>Where God guides, He protects.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
