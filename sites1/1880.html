  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua opens the Living Water Service with the Word of God
    <br>to prepare people's hearts before they climb the mountain of prayer.
    <br>Visitors from around the world step onto the altar and kneel down,
    <br>seeking God's mercy and grace.
    <br>As the multitude surge forward, Prophet T.B. Joshua is found in the people's midst,
    <br>walking side by side visitors, knowing that this heavenly atmosphere is one to be embraced
    <br>and not to be missed.
    <br>Evil spirits manifest, as the fire of God exposes them.
    <br>Blood and poisonous substances are flushed out, as the Holy Spirit uproots them.
    <br>This is the Living Water Service, where satanic bondages are broken
    <br>and God's children are set free.
    <br>My name is Rakiya Ibrahim.
    <br>The person beside me is my immediate younger sister.
    <br>She has numbness of the body and loss of sight.
    <br>She can't see things.
    <br>She can't walk or use her hands on her body until I assist her.
    <br>We have been to many hospitals and done all series of tests - ECG, MRI -
    <br>all kinds of tests - blood, urine - everything but the doctors could not find anything.
    <br>I remember that my sister told me about five years ago
    <br>that she had a dream which occurred four times.
    <br>The first time, she was driving in the dream and suddenly she went blind;
    <br>she couldn't see anything in front of her.
    <br>Then she woke up from the dream.
    <br>In the second dream, she was walking and suddenly went blind and woke up.
    <br>About four years ago, she was driving and it actually happened - she went blind;
    <br>she could not see anything.
    <br>She had to slow down, stop the car and then she regained her sight.
    <br>Since then, it became worse and it reached this stage.
    <br>We are so afraid because my elder sister had the same condition and she died.
    <br>She was blind and had numbness of the body.
    <br>We are afraid; we don't want anything to happen to my sister.
    <br>I believe God will heal her today, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That is the lady who has lost her sight.
    <br>She was brought here today by her sister with the problem of blindness for five years.
    <br>Five years she has been living in a world of darkness; she could not see with her eyes,
    <br>and her sister has been the one taking her from one place to another.
    <br>They have been to several places in search of solution - all to no avail.
    <br>She has come here today believing that the mighty God we serve is able to restore her sight
    <br>and take away the shadow of blindness that held her down for the past five years.
    <br>There she is right now praying and her sister beside her is also praying to God Almighty
    <br>to restore her eyes.
    <br>Woman Suffering From Blindness & Numbness For 5 Years - On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>That is the lady at the top of the mountain of prayer,
    <br>right now offering prayer to God Almighty to restore her sight.
    <br>You know what it is for five years not to be able to see.
    <br>See what is happening right now.
    <br>She is using her hands to rub the ground, the floor of the mountain of prayer, to rub the eyes.
    <br>There is nothing impossible with God Almighty.
    <br>Never a sickness He cannot heal, never a disease He cannot cure, never a problem He cannot solve.
    <br>Woman Suffering From Blindness & Numbness For 5 Years - Praying On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>Let us continue to watch and see what is happening.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty!
    <br>God Almighty has worked out the answer in the life of the sister.
    <br>We can see the sister that was totally blind a while ago
    <br>rising up on her feet, on her own without any aid or support,
    <br>giving glory to God Almighty for what He has done in her life.
    <br>A while ago she complained of total blindness.
    <br>- What colour of cloth are you seeing here?
    <br>- White.
    <br>That is the woman who has been blind for the past five horrible years.
    <br>I can see!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You can see her climbing down the stairs all by herself.
    <br>This was what she could not do before now for five horrible years that she has been blind.
    <br>And not only blindness, even all her bones were affected.
    <br>Walking was a problem, she had difficulty in walking,
    <br>but right now you can see her walking freely, moving freely, able to find her way by herself,
    <br>to the glory of God.
    <br>Having reached the Living Water section,
    <br>Mrs Thomas kneels down and fills her cup with the Living Water.
    <br>Immediately, as she holds the cup in her hands, her body begins to shake.
    <br>The cause of her affliction is being flushed out.
    <br>See the instant reaction of the woman
    <br>who has been healed of blindness and numbness of the whole body for five years.
    <br>See the instant reaction, after she takes the Living Water, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Right now, she is vomiting out poisonous substances.
    <br>The cause of the affliction in her life are coming out,
    <br>immediately after she takes the Living Water, in Jesus' Name.
    <br>I am good; I am OK!
    <br>I can see!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>My sister can see now and she can do things by herself.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>It is a moment of joy and celebration for this family.
    <br>Blindness for the past five years has just come to an end
    <br>by praying at the mountain of prayer and also by ministering the Living Water.
    <br>You can see the woman walking by herself, right now, unaided.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I can see.
    <br>- Tell us the colour this man is wearing.
    <br>- Orange.
    <br>Yes, that is an orange t-shirt.
    <br>Navy blue t-shirt with the stripes.
    <br>Navy blue t-shirt.
    <br>Black t-shirt.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?!
    <br>Amazing!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ, as she comes forward giving glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Hauwa Thomas from Kano, northern part of Nigeria.
    <br>The lady standing beside me is my sister Rakiya, my immediate senior sister.
    <br>Four years ago I started feel 'somehow' and I had this dream:
    <br>I was driving.
    <br>Suddenly, I could not see in front of me.
    <br>It went all black.
    <br>Immediately I stopped to see what was happening.
    <br>Then I regained my sight.
    <br>In the second dream I was walking and I saw some people ahead of me.
    <br>I was trying to catch up with them.
    <br>Immediately everything went black - I could not see them any more.
    <br>So I stopped again and regained my sight.
    <br>These dreams happened four times.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Each time it happened I would say it was not me - I rejected it in Jesus' name.
    <br>I had been praying but it was not an intense prayer.
    <br>When it all started, I went to different kind of hospitals.
    <br>They told me it was typhoid.
    <br>I took medications for typhoid but there were no results.
    <br>I went to a specialist in a hospital.
    <br>When I went there, I met the doctors.
    <br>They asked me a series of questions and sent me to do a series of tests.
    <br>I went and did all of the tests.
    <br>The tests showed everything was normal.
    <br>They said I would see the consultant.
    <br>When I went to the hospital to see them, they avoided me; they did not know what to tell me.
    <br>Finally, I met the consultant.
    <br>She examined me.
    <br>She asked me some questions.
    <br>I told her that there was somebody with a similar case in my family, but she was late.
    <br>It was my senior sister.
    <br>She said that it was heredity and that there was no cure for this.
    <br>She advised me to go for physiotherapy and acupuncture.
    <br>Then she said that if I would not go, there was a possibility of paralysis within six months.
    <br>I said OK.
    <br>I started to plan going to Kano.
    <br>I came to Kano.
    <br>I had been watching Emmanuel TV - everybody was telling me to go to Synagogue.
    <br>My mum would say, "Please, go to Synagogue."
    <br>I said, "OK, I will go."
    <br>Everybody was planning how they could help me.
    <br>People called me saying they knew somebody.
    <br>I answered that I was not interested if it was not a pastor.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>I came to Lagos.
    <br>I met my sister. She asked, "Is it that bad?"
    <br>I said, "It is that bad.
    <br>My brother had to bring me down to Lagos, though he is a small boy.
    <br>At times he would forget that he was holding me and just go away, and I would start shouting his name.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>When we came for the Living Water Service - you can see on the screen what was happening.
    <br>She was holding me, she had to help me, we had to be going together.
    <br>When we came, I went to the altar and she said I should kneel down - I knelt down and I prayed.
    <br>I said, "Lord, help me, because I'm here - help me.
    <br>The miracles have been seen - let me testify."
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>It all happened:
    <br>Immediately I finished, I went to the other place.
    <br>I was on the stone rubbing my eyes like this.
    <br>When I opened my eyes, there was brightness everywhere.
    <br>Everywhere was so bright, so colourful, so beautiful.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My miracle started exactly here.
    <br>When I went to the Living Water pool,
    <br>I took it inside my system - I started vomiting.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>I was not expecting anything like that but my body was shaking.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>I noticed I had that strength to stand on my own.
    <br>I was feeling as if it was too much - I just wanted to run.
    <br>My sister said, "No, there will be time for that."
    <br>I said, OK.
    <br>That was how I took the Living Water.
    <br>When I was taking the Living Water, I heard a voice, "Stand up. You are healed."
    <br>Then I said, "I am OK."
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>It was a beautiful experience.
    <br>Once again, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My hands were very stiff; I couldn't hold things with my hands because they were numb.
    <br>I could hold a bottle for some minutes but I could drop it, without knowing it.
    <br>I was not going out for any events.
    <br>The only place I was going to was church.
    <br>And even going to the church - somebody had to lead me.
    <br>That was what I have been experiencing.
    <br>It affected my family, especially when my elder sister had the same issue.
    <br>We were all worried - her condition was not even as severe as mine.
    <br>It was strange to us because we didn't have such experiences before.
    <br>And she would not open up - she was the kind of person that kept things to herself.
    <br>That was how we lost her.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>When it came to me, I couldn't be quiet.
    <br>I was so worried.
    <br>All I knew, all I saw was God.
    <br>I never looked at anything else.
    <br>What has kept me was the Word of God.
    <br>I held onto the Word of God.
    <br>I never allowed myself to see any challenge - I didn't see it.
    <br>People at times would notice; I didn't notice it anymore.
    <br>It got to a stage I said, "Lord, I am like those three - Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego.
    <br>If You heal me, I am serving You.
    <br>Even if You don't heal me, You are still my God.
    <br>I will serve You, no matter what it will take.
    <br>No matter what people say, I will serve You and You will still be my God."
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You said this problem affected your life generally.
    <br>Tell us how much this problem affected your job, your career, everything.
    <br>I am a graduate and I couldn't look for a job.
    <br>Nobody would want to employ somebody like me,
    <br>somebody shaking, not able to stand.
    <br>Even if I went there, they would say, "Madam, go to the hospital."
    <br>I am sure this was what they would tell me.
    <br>That was why I didn't like to go out - I was hiding myself.
    <br>Even when I went to the church, I stayed at the back, so nobody would even notice I was around.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>My children helped me in everything.
    <br>They are 6-10 years old - they hold me like this.
    <br>But today - you can see me - I can walk, I can see,
    <br>I can read the Bible, I can study, I can go to places myself.
    <br>When I went to my room in hotel, I couldn't eat, I was so excited, I lost my appetite.
    <br>I said, "God, this is so wonderful to behold."
    <br>I want the whole world to hear my testimony, what God has done in my life.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I am feeling healthy, strong, vibrant, active.
    <br>I don't ask for help, I do things myself.
    <br>I don't need to say, "Come."
    <br>At times, I needed to beg, saying, "Please come and help."
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Now, I would just get up, just do it - now I am sound.
    <br>I give God the glory, I give God praise for what He has done.
    <br>Anybody coming here looking for a testimony - God will give you one, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>My name is Rakiya Ibrahim.
    <br>The lady beside me is my sister Hauwa Thomas.
    <br>This challenge has been very difficult for us
    <br>because my sister has been married for ten years
    <br>and I also want to thank her husband for being patient with her.
    <br>It has not been easy; he was the one to bath the children, to take them to school,
    <br>to cook, to clean, to do so many things.
    <br>Not many men would be that patient - I really thank God for him.
    <br>It has been so difficult.
    <br>My sister is a professional teacher.
    <br>Because of this illness she lost her job.
    <br>She could not hold a pencil, could not mark with it, she could not do anything.
    <br>When the eye problem became worse, she could not see.
    <br>It started with the numbness of the body, then it graduated to this stage.
    <br>The last doctor she saw said that they had to do something as soon as possible.
    <br>My sister was on therapy three times a week, which was not easy.
    <br>I had to take her there, wait for the therapy and bring her back home.
    <br>It has not been easy at all but God has been faithful.
    <br>When we were doing the therapy, we decided to come here
    <br>because the doctor said that there was no cure.
    <br>We can only believe in God and if nothing would be done about it in the next six months,
    <br>the body would shut down.
    <br>I remember our elder sister - her illness started like that but it was not that severe.
    <br>She was going blind gradually and one day her body shut down.
    <br>So this fear has been in me.
    <br>I said, "God, I don't want this to happen to my sister.
    <br>If You are God in heaven, answer us when we come to The SCOAN."
    <br>And God did it.
    <br>You can all see, you can all testify - this is our testimony that the Lord did it for us.
    <br>The God that did it for us will do it for you too, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>The Living Water is amazing.
    <br>I was having great expectation when I came.
    <br>I want you to also have expectation.
    <br>I was hoping to see the man of God,
    <br>but when we came to the Living Water Service, he did the Service and prayed over the water
    <br>and gave us the opportunity to do our prayer and the ministration of water.
    <br>But when my sister went to the mountain,
    <br>even before she got to the water,
    <br>I noticed the way she turned and looked at me.
    <br>I felt a shock in my body that she could see.
    <br>I knew that God has done it.
    <br>When we went to the water and she took the water, I felt the voice telling me,
    <br>"She is OK. It is finished."
    <br>Just like Jesus said on the cross, "It is finished."
    <br>I could feel it in my body that it was done.
    <br>I give God the glory.
    <br>My advice is especially for family members:
    <br>If your loved ones or friends are sick, do not forsake them.
    <br>Stand by them, take care of them, encourage them to know the Lord,
    <br>encourage them to seek help.
    <br>Some will know where the help is but they will not tell you, saying you will not believe.
    <br>Why not try it?
    <br>Tell them, "Look for God! Look for solution!"
    <br>Don't wait until their situation is like my sister's situation was, before you look for God.
    <br>Stay blessed.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>If we look at Proverbs 3:5, it says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
    <br>and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge God,
    <br>and He shall direct your paths."
    <br>I want to tell us, "Watch and pray" because that is what can keep you these days.
    <br>Remain blessed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Right now, to the glory of God we want to see our sister walking back to her seat, to the glory of God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
