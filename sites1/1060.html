  <p>    
    <br>I want to assure you that wherever you are, Jesus is there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Jesus is going to give us His Word - prayer language
    <br>And whatever word we pronounce now is not just a word - that is the language for you.
    <br>Believe it.
    <br>I'm not going to raise a prayer point, but I'm going to say it according to God's will,
    <br>according to Heaven. So please, be ready.
    <br>Don't think, "You want me to say after you" - No, that is not it.
    <br>This is a word for you to destroy whatever temple that is disturbing you.
    <br>So please, are you ready?
    <br>There's one thing you need to do.
    <br>Have you forgiven those who sinned against you?
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have to forgive.
    <br>Allow your heart to talk about this.
    <br>So you can just conclude here. When you leave from here, you will follow it up.
    <br>If there's anyone somewhere that has wronged you - so painful -
    <br>and you have said you would never forgive.
    <br>In your heart here, take that decision that "Yes, it is over!"
    <br>So when you leave from here, you can follow up the restitution.
    <br>Right now, forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.
    <br>The Bible say, when you stand to pray, forgive.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>When you stand to pray, forgive.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>When you stand to pray, forgive.
    <br>Again
    <br>When you stand to pray, forgive.
    <br>You just stand and you want to pray. You just have to forgive.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, put it behind you.
    <br>Because you need a free spirit. You don't need to imprison your spirit.
    <br>When you imprison your spirit, it cannot attract God's Spirit.
    <br>To hold offence, whether you are right or wrong, you are imprisoning your spirit.
    <br>Now, it is time to attract God's Spirit.
    <br>I release every spirit that holds offence.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Sometimes you need intervention, you need someone to come in.
    <br>You don´t know that you need someone to help you.
    <br>I release every spirit that holds offence.
    <br>Every spirit that holds offence - be released in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes, we are saved with authority.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Sometimes you may not even know.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The dividends of forgiveness is freedom.
    <br>When you forgive, you receive freedom.
    <br>That is just it. I want you to know that.
    <br>The dividends of forgiveness is what?
    <br>Freedom.
    <br>How can you continue caging yourself?
    <br>Whether you are accused or you are accuser,
    <br>for how long will you continue to cage yourself?
    <br>This world is a journey - a marathon.
    <br>You cannot continue caging yourself.
    <br>The Bible says, I will set a table before you in the presence of your what?
    <br>Enemies!
    <br>Eh hen, what else again?
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, we are saying to you -
    <br>the cage of sickness, poverty, isolation is as a result of forgiveness.
    <br>Whether you are the accused or the accuser,
    <br>you find yourself in a cage of poverty,
    <br>you find yourself in a cage of affliction,
    <br>it must be - that is the root.
    <br>The root of poverty is unforgiveness.
    <br>The root of affliction is unforgiveness.
    <br>The root of isolation, depression is unforgiveness.
    <br>Unforgiveness is the root. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The root of isolation is unforgiveness.
    <br>The root of affliction is unforgiveness.
    <br>The root of depression is unforgiveness.
    <br>The root of poverty is unforgiveness.
    <br>Whether you are the accused or the accuser, that is the root.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers, right now, it is time to begin to release yourself.
    <br>You have been in that cage of poverty, isolation, affliction, setback;
    <br>please, forgive whether you are the accused or the accuser.
    <br>Jesus said, "Forgive them, they don´t know what they are doing".
    <br>You are included!
    <br>Begin to forgive. I release your spirit, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release your spirit, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>To release your spirit is for you to realise, "Ah, no! What is the gain?"
    <br>Ask yourself, "Ok, this man has wronged me. This woman has wronged me"
    <br>and you now hold that offence.
    <br>For how many years now are you holding that offenve? What is your gain?
    <br>Leave it for God. Don't worry yourself. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Leave it for God. Don't worry yourself.
    <br>Our life is under repair.
    <br>Something that is under repair which is yearning to be repaired, not destroyed.
    <br>Say, "Mercy!"
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>Say, "Mercy!"
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>Say, "Mercy!"
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>I can´t hear you!
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>Viewers all over the world!
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>This is what you need now.
    <br>Open your lips now and say, "Have mercy on me, Son of David!"
    <br>Have mercy on me, Son of David!
    <br>You yourself sit down and think about your life.
    <br>Every hope and every belief we had in the past -
    <br>when your children graduate and become a professor, you have everything you need.
    <br>If you become a manager of a company, you have everything you need.
    <br>Look at many homes today.
    <br>See homes, see families, see disunity.
    <br>There's disunity everywhere.
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>I can´t hear you!
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>I can´t hear you!
    <br>Mercy!
    <br>That is it. Who needs mercy?
    <br>That is, holding unforgiveness. You are holding unforgiveness, and you need mercy.
    <br>It is not about your weakness - not about your setback.
    <br>Here I am.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to bind your body, soul, spirit
    <br>to the will and purpose of God for your life.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, be bound, in the name of Jesus -
    <br>to the will and purpose of God, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your soul, spirit and body - be bound, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every spirit that stands to challenge you,
    <br>that stands to challenge everything about you -
    <br>every spirit that stands to challenge you, that stands to challenge your health -
    <br>begin to rebuke it, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I loose that spirit!
    <br>Loose it, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>Make my heart a channel of forgiveness where there is injury.
    <br>Make my heart a channel of pardon.
    <br>Make my heart a channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Make my heart a channel of obedience where there is disobedience.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for dying in my place.
    <br>I believe.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for Your Salvation. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I can't hear your Amen.

    <br>Amen
    <br>You received Christ?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, your voice should be the voice of testimony, not the voice of complaint.
    <br>"Do you know, I still have pain here."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My voice is the voice of testimony".
    <br>My voice is the voice of testimony.
    <br>That is it.
