    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering 
    <br>Prophecy & Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>This is an operation.
    <br>You should pray against operation.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Because before now, it was water
    <br>that was coming out.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>Like a kind of fluid that was coming out of you.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>But it has stopped and it contains blood.
    <br>God loves you; don't worry.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering 
    <br>Prophecy & Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Do you have a medical report?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Okay. Bring it out.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering 
    <br>Prophecy & Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Your womb is coming out.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us -  Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Durgadevi Narasimha from India.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was fluid coming out of my womb.
    <br>When I came here, I was prayed upon by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He said pray against surgery because fluid was coming out of me.
    <br>When I went back, I didn't have any problem,
    <br>the fluid that was coming out of my body stopped (flowing)
    <br>and I didn't have to undergo any surgery regarding my womb.
    <br>I give all praise to God.
    <br>Also, there was stagnation in my career.
    <br>I was working as a staff nurse for ten years.
    <br>When I went back and I prayed about it, I was promoted from a staff nurse to a nursing sister.
    <br>This caused an increase in my income.
    <br>I give all the glory to Jesus.
    <br>You mean after the prophecy of the man of God concerning your health
    <br>and also praying for you that very day,
    <br>when you went back to your country,
    <br>not only were you healed of that situation that was to take you for an operation,
    <br>but also you were promoted in your place of work from a staff nurse to a nursing sister, isn't it?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>For how long have you been looking for this promotion?
    <br>Almost ten years.
    <br>There was stagnation in my life.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Now I don't have any problem regarding my womb or anything.
    <br>I am totally free and delivered.
    <br>Amen! Let's clap for Jesus one more time.
    <br>This is my promotion order and you can see my name Durgadevi Narasimha.
    <br>Also, as a result of this promotion, there is an increase in my salary.
    <br>So this is my testimony.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My advice is that you should always pray to God and keep watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>because there is a lot of anointing flowing through it.
    <br>When we pray, God always makes a way.
    <br>You can trust God.
    <br>Once again, let's clap for Jesus Christ.
