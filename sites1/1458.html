  <p>    
    <br>Lord, liberate my spirit.
    <br>Greet your neighbour. Say, "Neighbour, welcome to the presence of God.
    <br>You are welcome in His presence".
    <br>Say, "Good Morning" to your neighbour.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, Good Morning to your life, destiny, career, health!"
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Say, "Good Morning" to the viewers.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We are serving a living God.
    <br>Say, "I am serving a living God - merciful and kind, in Jesus' name".
    <br>Brethren, we are here in the presence of Jesus.
    <br>We ought to acknowledge God in all spiritual things.
    <br>We need to acknowledge His goodness, His grace in our lives
    <br>in thoughts, words and purpose.
    <br>We are whom we are, what we are and where we are by His grace.
    <br>Say, "I am who I am, where I am by His grace".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the reason we are gathered here this morning.
    <br>Jesus is not only an embodiment of the Father but also of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Therefore, when we call the name of Jesus, we should call that name in Spirit and in truth,
    <br>in Spirit and in faith.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, when we call that name, Jesus Christ,
    <br>we should call that name in Spirit and in faith".
    <br>The name of Jesus Christ is not to be used as an instrument to get results
    <br>but to get the authority in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Bible says we have two Christs in the church today:
    <br>the Christ of history, the Christ of stories, songs, baby Jesus,
    <br>and we have the Christ whom the Holy Spirit reveals - Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Say, "The Jesus Christ I know is Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit".
    <br>All power and authority in Heaven has been invested in that name, Jesus Christ.
    <br>The very foundation for receiving answers to our prayers today
    <br>is to base our faith on the fact that
    <br>Jesus died on the Cross of Calvary to provide what we are asking for.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the very foundation for receiving answers to our prayers
    <br>is to base our faith on the fact that
    <br>Jesus died to provide what we are asking for".
    <br>He is the object of our faith. He is alive.
    <br>This brings us to our message this morning, "The Power Of Faith".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Power Of Faith".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Power! Glory!
    <br>Glory! Power!"
    <br>The power of faith.
    <br>Let's open our Bibles to the Book of Romans 10, from verse 6.
    <br>That will be our proof text for today.
    <br>I start my reading from verse 6.
    <br>"But the righteousness of faith speaks in this way, 'Do not say in your heart,
    <br>'Who will ascend into Heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down from above)
    <br>or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
    <br>But what does it say? 'The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart'
    <br>(that is, the word of faith which we preach):
    <br>that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus
    <br>and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
    <br>For with the heart one believes unto righteousness,
    <br>and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
    <br>Verse 17 and last verse.
    <br>"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Let someone say, "The power of faith".
    <br>Brethren, what a danger is a religion of words where there is no action.
    <br>Where there is no action, there is nothing but mental assent.
    <br>The Word of God is not history.
    <br>The Bible is more than long ago events and ancient wisdom.
    <br>It is the message of grace and truth for you and me today.
    <br>The Book of Acts of Apostles is not mere history;
    <br>it is the pattern of what Jesus Christ wants His Church to be today.
    <br>One thing we should bear in mind: God is Spirit.
    <br>Therefore, faith in God, faith in Christ Jesus is not a natural issue but a spiritual issue.
    <br>Faith in God is a spiritual force that grows and develops in the heart of man.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart; faith is of man's spirit.
    <br>Man's heart - man's spirit, the inner man, the man himself.
    <br>Let someone say, "The power of faith".
    <br>In the Book of Luke 10:19, the Bible says that
    <br>Jesus Christ has given to all believers the power of attorney to use His name.
    <br>You have been given power, I have been given power but the Bible says
    <br>it must be exercised by faith according to the will of God, not the will of man.
    <br>Jesus has given us the power of attorney to use His name.
    <br>That spirit of faith is expressed by believing with our heart and confessing with our mouth.
    <br>Let someone say, "There is power in my mouth;
    <br>the belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth".
    <br>This means that faith requires that you speak first before you see or feel the result.
    <br>Therefore, no matter what your situation is,
    <br>the Bible says you need to speak faith, act faith to activate God's power.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, speak faith, act faith to activate God's power".
    <br>Let someone say, "The power of faith".
    <br>Faith releases the blessings of God - healing, deliverance, salvation,
    <br>breakthrough, anointing.
    <br>They are for whosoever wills.
    <br>Jesus has paid the price.
    <br>We have been given power.
    <br>But what is required? The necessary faith.
    <br>What does Jesus need to heal you, to set you free? Just believe.
    <br>Believing, that is our connection.
    <br>Say, "Believing, that is my connection to release the power".
    <br>But today, many Christians are facing a lot of challenges all over the world.
    <br>One of the challenges is that one can be a man of prayer but perhaps not a man of faith.
    <br>If one is a man of prayer but not of faith, he is just saying words.
    <br>Millions of prayers are offered today with almost no faith.
    <br>God Almighty has promised to respond
    <br>only to the faith that is promised and rooted in the Word of God.
    <br>Let someone say, "Prayer is not right if it does not spring from faith".
    <br>All prayers must be prayers of faith.
    <br>Because I believe, I pray; because I believe, I ask.
    <br>All prayers should be prayers of faith.
    <br>Because I believe, I pray; because I believe, I ask.
    <br>There is need to activate your faith.
    <br>Activate your faith.
    <br>How do you activate your faith?
    <br>What is the status of your faith?
    <br>In other words, what is the condition of your heart?
    <br>Because faith is of man's heart, man's spirit.
    <br>The Bible says that God Almighty listens to us when we pray and responds to us
    <br>according to the condition of our heart.
    <br>What is the condition of your heart?
    <br>What is hindering us from receiving answers from God is not on the outside
    <br>but on the inside of us.
    <br>If you do not love your neighbour; as the prophet said -
    <br>your neighbour can be your enemy,
    <br>your neighbour can be someone who does not share the same faith as you.
    <br>The Bible says, "'Love them all'.
    <br>If you do not forgive those who hurt you,
    <br>if you do not forgive those who commit shameful acts, destroy things in your life,
    <br>the power of faith is short-circuited.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, if you do not love your neighbour,
    <br>if you do not release forgiveness,
    <br>the power of faith is short-circuited".
    <br>It means the power of faith is dormant.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, activate your faith".
    <br>You need to activate your faith. How do we activate our faith?
    <br>The Bible says that love is an activator to life.
    <br>Say, "Love is an activator to life".
    <br>The Scripture says, 'My righteous shall live by faith'.
    <br>Therefore, we should live a life of love because faith works by love.
    <br>Galatians 5:6 says clearly that the love of God makes faith operate.
    <br>The love of God makes faith operate.
    <br>It means love is the force that sets faith working.
    <br>Faith and love must work together to become effective.
    <br>Therefore, activate your faith by activating your love.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, activate your love".
    <br>How do we activate our love?
    <br>The Bible says that love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>Love looks around to see who is crying, in need of your love, care or attention.
    <br>As the prophet says, "Love does not discriminate".
    <br>He may be your enemy or one who does not share the same faith as you.
    <br>Love does not discriminate; love them all.
    <br>When you activate your love by planting the seed of love, love will answer you.
    <br>When you plant the seed of love, you are activating your faith.
    <br>Unfortunately, many of us have stifled our faith by failing to walk in love.
    <br>Many of us have stifled their faith by failing to walk in love.
    <br>Failure to walk in love can almost shut down our spiritual walk with Jesus.
    <br>Therefore, when you activate your love - what do I mean?
    <br>When you have a vehicle, you need to service your vehicle.
    <br>If you do not service your vehicle, that vehicle will not work.
    <br>Many destinies and lives today are shut down because we do not service our lives.
    <br>You service your life by loving those who are around you.
    <br>You service your life when you plant the seed of love to those around you.
    <br>When you give what your life depends on, you are servicing your life, activating your life.
    <br>And when you cry to love, love will answer you - Jesus is love.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you ready to activate your love?"
    <br>When love is expressed in this manner, you will see things happen to your life.
    <br>You will see amendments coming, changes coming to your life
    <br>because Jesus is our standard.
    <br>It is of absolute necessity that you believe in the name Jesus - God has appointed it.
    <br>It has full power and authority both in Heaven and on earth to save, heal and deliver.
    <br>God's power is the same yesterday, today and forever because God is immortal.
    <br>Jesus is ready to set you free if you are willing.
    <br>The Living Word in the lips of Jesus Christ rises above the law of nature.
    <br>Jesus spoke, He sent forth His Word and brought Lazarus out of the grave.
    <br>Jesus met a man at the pool of Bethesda bedridden for 38 years.
    <br>Jesus sent forth the Word and changed the history of his life,
    <br>appointed him to eternal life and good health.
    <br>Jesus met a Samaritan woman - an outcast who had no right to belong,
    <br>a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel.
    <br>But Jesus appointed her to her future success and appointed her to eternity.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>No matter your situation, look to Jesus.
    <br>There is no need greater than Him.
    <br>He is sitting on the seat of power and with Power.
    <br>Finally, brethren, faith is of man's heart; faith is of man's spirit.
    <br>Faith is a force that grows and develops in the heart of man.
    <br>When the heart gets lost, faith is gone because our heart is where faith lives.
    <br>Take care of your heart.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, take care of your heart".
    <br>Say, "Take care of your heart
    <br>because your heart is the prayer room, your heart is the dwelling place".
    <br>It is acting on the Word of God that builds faith into the heart of the believer.
    <br>Our heart must be rooted and grounded in the Word of God.
    <br>Say, "My heart must be rooted and grounded in the Word of God".
    <br>It is the Word of God that teaches us the value, the authority,
    <br>the legal right to use the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
    <br>What is the value? Redemption, righteousness, salvation and all of God's blessings.
    <br>Therefore, let your heart be engaged with the Word of God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, feed your heart with the Word of God".
    <br>When you feed your heart with the Word of God, faith stands.
    <br>When you feed your heart with the Word of God, you feed on God's ability.
    <br>When you feed on God's Word, you feed on God's wisdom.
    <br>When you feed your heart with the Word of God, you feed on God's life.
    <br>Therefore, let your heart be grounded in His Word.
    <br>When you feed your heart with the Word of God, it becomes a reality in the situation of crisis.
    <br>Then you will be able to master every situation that comes in your life.
    <br>Read your Bible.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, read your Bible for in it - salvation.
    <br>Read your Bible for in it - redemption.
    <br>Read it; it has converting power.
    <br>Read it; it has enduring power.
    <br>Read it; it has salvation power".
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in our hearts, in Jesus' name. Thank You, Jesus.
