  <p>    
    <br>My name is Chief Ikenna Victor Egbuna.
    <br>I am a native of Onicha (Nigeria).
    <br>I am a lawyer. I'm also a chartered insurer and chartered accountant.
    <br>I have come to give all glory to the Almighty for lifting me from the valley to the mountaintop.
    <br>My problem started in 1986 when I came back from my national youth service.
    <br>I happened to come from a family of idol worshippers.
    <br>I am a descendant of red cap chiefs on both sides.
    <br>I was only 9 years old when my father died.
    <br>Because of the challenges in the family, I became very close to my mother.
    <br>In fact, I was usually referred to as her handbag.
    <br>But when I came back from the youth service,
    <br>one day, one of my uncles came and told my mother that they went to consult an idol
    <br>to find out why members of my family die at a very young age.
    <br>After the consultation, as they were leaving, the woman was calling them,
    <br>"Come, come! Ikenna, Ikenna!"
    <br>And they asked, "Why?"
    <br>She said, "Look, there is a young man in your family who is a lawyer.
    <br>His name is Ikenna, and he is going to die!"
    <br>So, my mother started panicking and asked, "What do we do?"
    <br>He said, "The priestess said they should bring me".
    <br>So, they took me to the lady with my elder sister, she performed her concoctions,
    <br>used a razor blade to give me marks and inserted those things on my body.
    <br>From that day, my mother hated me with passion and everything I did was not acceptable to her.
    <br>In my professional background - I started my career as a lawyer -
    <br>in fact, within six months, my principal asked me to leave his office.
    <br>I tried to get another place to work - I did not.
    <br>At a point, because I was proficient in mathematics, I started looking for what else to do.
    <br>I started studying insurance.
    <br>It took me seven years to qualify as an associate of the Chartered Insurance Institute, London.
    <br>I became a chartered insurer.
    <br>I started looking for jobs. I would apply and be shortlisted.
    <br>The day the application would be unsealed, it would be discovered that I did not even sign it.
    <br>I looked for other jobs - assistant general manager at Ajaokuta Steel,
    <br>secretary NJSC, chief registrar at court - there must be one problem along the line.
    <br>But one thing that is significant, is that at every of such application,
    <br>I would have a dream - a strange woman would come and sleep with me.
    <br>After that, everything about that would go.
    <br>That continued until I heard about The SCOAN, and I came to meet with the man of God.
    <br>When I met him one-on-one, he gave me this Morning Water and this booklet
    <br>titled 'What The Future Holds'. He signed his signature on it and gave it to me.
    <br>From that day, my destiny started the journey of restoration.
    <br>Before, I would go to court, do a case very well but would not be able to collect money.
    <br>In some cases, I did not even collect a dime.
    <br>Later, with the visit to The SCOAN, I no longer witnessed any strange person coming to sleep with me.
    <br>I dropped the certificates of insurance and accounting
    <br>and went back to my original profession - the legal profession.
    <br>One night, after praying with the man of God on the screen
    <br>and administering the Morning Water, I saw him in the dream.
    <br>I discovered myself in my first office.
    <br>I discovered I was lying helplessly in the office
    <br>and the protector was locked with about three keys.
    <br>I was locked up inside that office.
    <br>And the man of God came.
    <br>When I saw him, I jumped up, "Man of God! Man of God!"
    <br>He just opened the keys and asked me to come out.
    <br>And I came out.
    <br>From that day, my destiny started a very fsst recovery journey.
    <br>And today, I am a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.
    <br>That is the highest professional accomplishment in the legal profession.
    <br>I was sworn in on the 18th of September, 2017.
    <br>In the list, which is on this board, I am Number 7,
    <br>out of the 30 people that were made senior advocates.
    <br>Over 500 people applied, 169 were shortlisted and only 30 were awarded the rank.
    <br>And I am Number 7 among them.
    <br>The picture you see here is myself in my full regalia as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.
    <br>This one is the one we took at the Supreme Court on the Swearing-In Day with my dear wife.
    <br>This one too is also a photograph we took on that day
    <br>with my brother-in-the-Lord Oche Nabi Esquire, Senior Advocate of Nigeria.
    <br>On the board here - I attended the University of Ife where I graduated in 1984.
    <br>This is my graduation certificate.
    <br>I was called to the bar in 1985. This is my certificate.
    <br>I became an associate of the Chartered Insurance Institute, London.
    <br>This is my qualification, my certificate.
    <br>Now, because the Insurance Institute, London, is the first all over the world,
    <br>if you are a member of that institute, you can get a job anywhere.
    <br>When I got frustrated in Nigeria, I applied to England, to formally elect me as an associate.
    <br>And in 2004, they did. This is the certificate.
    <br>I read my accountancy at the University of Ife. This is my certificate.
    <br>I became a member of the Association of National Accountants in 2001.
    <br>So, sir, with all of these certificates and qualifications,
    <br>you mean, you were still experiencing such severe stagnation
    <br>until you encountered Jesus Christ here at The SCOAN.
    <br>Yes. The only thing that worked in my life was reading 24 hours in a day and passing exams.
    <br>But I never got any job.
    <br>It was only when I came to The SCOAN, where I was given the Morning Water
    <br>and the man of God released me from the 'spiritual sale' I didn't know I was in
    <br>that my destiny started shining again.
    <br>I started getting big briefs again and now, I am a Senior Advocate of Nigeria.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Tell us - after you encountered Jesus here, what changes have you experienced in that area,
    <br>in terms of your relationship with your family.
    <br>My relationship with my mother changed.
    <br>On day, she called me on the phone and asked, "Where are you?"
    <br>I told her. She said, "I want to see you".
    <br>When I went to see her, she said, "Ikenna, I don't know what happened between us".
    <br>It is as clear as daylight that it was that demonic influence of that...
    <br>I don't know whether it was the initiation they did to me that caused the whole thing.
    <br>Today, our relationship is restored. I am back as her handbag.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sir, you said, before, you were plagued with such terrible nightmares,
    <br>sleeping with women at the point of breakthrough in your dreams.
    <br>Just tell us - after you came here, what changed in that area?
    <br>As soon as I came here, I stopped having such experience.
    <br>In fact, the last experience I had - somebody came and I said, "I don't know who you are!"
    <br>She started trying to convince me and I saw myself beating her,
    <br>something I have never done in my life. I gave her serious blows and she had to run away.
    <br>And that was the last time I experienced that in my life.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>When I compiled my applications - because for the application as Senior Advocate,
    <br>you compile judgements you have obtained that are landmark judgements.
    <br>In fact, they are contained in about four big 'Ghana-must-go' (plastic bags).
    <br>What I did was to place the man of God's signature on it.
    <br>Every two days I would change it to the other one.
    <br>It was after about 8 days that I decided to go and submit the application.
    <br>And in my mind I was convinced that my application had the signature of the Almighty.
    <br>And indeed, it was successful. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Children of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>In fact, as you can see, I am so happy!
    <br>I don't know how to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>After 31 years of stagnation in practice,
    <br>we had an encounter with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Our sorrow turned to joy and testimonies.
    <br>And my husband has said it all.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My word of advice goes like this:
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is God's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary.
    <br>I say so on the following grounds:
    <br>One, The SCOAN is the biggest healing and therapeutic centre all over the world.
    <br>Two, Prophet T.B. Joshua is God's biggest micro and macro economist
    <br>who predicts the economy of the whole world with precision, without statistics.
    <br>Three, Prophet T.B. Joshua is God's inspector general of the whole world.
    <br>He predicts security challenges - be it in Syria, North Korea, United States - and proffers solutions.
    <br>Number Four, The SCOAN and Prophet T.B. Joshua have created a platform
    <br>for hundreds of thousands of people to see God.
    <br>I am talking about the Emmanuel TV Partners who go about the whole world doing good.
    <br>Number Five, Prophet T.B. Joshua is a man overly endowed with Christian urbanity.
    <br>I am talking about his reconcilitation ministry, his being father to the fatherless,
    <br>and in fact, hope to the hopeless.
    <br>Number Six, Prophet T.B. Joshua is one of the few positive images of this country.
    <br>If you go outside Nigeria, the only thing you hear about Nigerians are negative things.
    <br>But it is only because of Prophet T.B. Joshua that many countries have established
    <br>and others are seeking to establish diplomatic relations with Nigeria.
    <br>Finally, my advice is that anybody - be him a Nigerian or a foreigner -
    <br>who has not visited The SCOAN is cheating himself. Thank you.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
