  <p>    
    <br>Today, we believe God for His grace.
    <br>We shall dwell on, "Believing is Possessing".
    <br>Mark 16 verse 17 - "And these signs will follow those who believe:
    <br>In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents;
    <br>and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them."
    <br>This will lead us to 1 John 5 verse 1 - "Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God,
    <br>and everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him."
    <br>Verse 2 - "By this we know that we love the children of God,
    <br>when we love God and keep His commandments."
    <br>Verse 3 - "For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.
    <br>And His commandments are not burdensome."
    <br>Verse 4 - "For whatever is born of God overcomes the world."
    <br>This added to the glory and evidence of the gospel.
    <br>This statement - "For whatever is born of God overcomes the world.
    <br>And this is the victory that has overcome the world - our faith."
    <br>Verse 5 - "Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
    <br>Verse 6 - "This is He who came by water and blood - Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood..."
    <br>This is emphatical.
    <br>Verse 13 - "These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God,
    <br>that you may know that you have eternal life,
    <br>and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God."
    <br>Verse 14 - "Now this is the confidence that we have in Him..."
    <br>That confidence also means 'boldness'.
    <br>"Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us."
    <br>He hears us; that is as good as an answer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "He hears me; that is as good as an answer."
    <br>If I say, "Jesus" and He says, "Yes, my son", that is as good as an answer;
    <br>that is as good as a solution; that is as good as healing; that is as good as blessing.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The Bible passage has said it all.
    <br>Believing is possessing.
    <br>When you believe His Word, you possess the thing that His Word has guaranteed.
    <br>He sent forth His Word and blessed us.
    <br>He sent forth His Word and healed us.
    <br>He sent forth His Word and saved us.
    <br>When you believe His Word, you pray and you know it is His will.
    <br>You pray but you don't know whether it is His will to give you what you are asking for.
    <br>When you believe His Word, you pray and you know it is His will.
    <br>When you pray in that name...
    <br>When you pray in that name, Jesus takes over it, then it is in His care.
    <br>This is why we say, "If you believe, leave it for God; don't worry yourself".
    <br>Are you troubled? Leave it for God.
    <br>Are you in pain? Leave it for God.
    <br>If you believe, leave it for Him.
    <br>God does not need your support to remove that situation.
    <br>The Bible says that your word, then, in Jesus' name, makes things come into being.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Your word, then, in Jesus' name, makes things come into being - I mean, come to pass."
    <br>It is no longer your burden, as long as you do not repudiate it by a wrong confession.
    <br>My heart knows that the case is settled.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "My heart knows that the case is settled."
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>No matter the signs, no matter the situation I am experiencing, my heart knows that the case is settled - if you believe.
    <br>You ask for healing, so you get out of bed and walk.

    <br>You ask for money, so you make provision to pay the bill.
    <br>BELIEVING is POSSESSING! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>You ask for rain, so you put on your raincoat; you are ready when the rain comes.
    <br>My heart knows that the case is settled.
    <br>That is the voice of a believer.
    <br>BELIEVING is POSSESSING! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>That is the voice of a possessor.
    <br>When you become a possessor, Jesus is your standby.
    <br>The Bible says that prayer should be followed by an attitude of absolute trust in Christ that He is working out the answer.
    <br>I ask for healing, so I get out of bed and walk.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Prayer should be followed by an attitude of absolute trust in Christ that He is working out the answer.
    <br>Mark 11 verse 24 - "Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe..."
    <br>Let someone say, "Believe".
    <br>Look at that language; I like that.
    <br>"...believe that you receive them."
    <br>Your prayer is based upon His Word.
    <br>My prayer is based upon His Word.
    <br>Scriptural prayer releases the power of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Fill your prayer with the Scriptures because Scriptural prayer releases the power of God."
    <br>Fill your prayer with the Scriptures.
    <br>Prayer and reading the Bible should always go together; one is not complete without the other.
    <br>Scriptural prayer releases the power of God.
    <br>This is to tell you that prayer has a language.
    <br>The language is in the Word of God.
    <br>Let me see your Bible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Read it, it is food for your soul.
    <br>Read it because it is your spiritual weapon."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Read it because it is a guide for your feet.
    <br>Without it, you walk in darkness.
    <br>It has a purifying power.
    <br>It has healing power.
    <br>It is enduring.
    <br>To keep you from sin and error.
    <br>It rejoices the heart.
    <br>It is so profitable.
    <br>Read it.
    <br>The heart must be rooted and grounded in the Word.
    <br>My heart knows that the case is settled.
    <br>But before your heart can know that the case is settled,
    <br>your heart must be rooted and grounded in the Word, so that what God says is final with you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Your heart must be rooted and grounded in the Word, so that what God says is final with you."
    <br>If your heart is not rooted and grounded in the Word, what God says is not final with you.
    <br>But when the heart is rooted and grounded in the Word, what God says is final with you.
    <br>Open the book of Romans 9 verse 1:
    <br>"I tell the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,"
    <br>What bears you witness?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Is it your body? Your mind? Your flesh?
    <br>My conscience bears me witness.
    <br>When your heart is rooted and grounded in the Word, you pray and know it is the will of God.
    <br>You will never do anything that is not the will of God.
    <br>You will talk and you will know that it is the will of God to talk.
    <br>You will dance and you will know that it is the will of God to dance.
    <br>You will look and know it is the will of God to do so.
    <br>Let the will of God be done.
    <br>We pray according to His will.
    <br>We are assured that He heard us and if He hears us that is as good as an answer.
    <br>You and Him are cooperating.
    <br>What do I mean by that?
    <br>You pray according to instructions given by Him.
    <br>You approach Him through the name.
    <br>In the book of Matthew 18 verse 18 to 19:
    <br>"Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven,
    <br>and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
    <br>Verse 19 - "Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them..."
    <br>That is:
    <br>Your word, then, in the name of Jesus, makes things come into being, to pass.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "My word, then, in the name of Jesus, makes things come into being, come to pass."
    <br>Believing is possessing.
    <br>Let someone say, "Believing is possessing."
    <br>The Bible says that when you are a believer, you pray and you will know it is His will to give you.
    <br>This is why - salvation first.
    <br>When salvation comes, you will know His will in your life.
