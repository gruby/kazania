    <br>DEPEND ON GOD'S SPIRIT! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>It is all about our Lord, Jesus Christ, not a god we do not know.
    <br>Take note of that - not a god we do not know.
    <br>When you worship a god you do not know, surprises come.
    <br>You ask for healing; attack comes.
    <br>You ask for deliverance; demonic attack comes.
    <br>You keep asking yourself, 'I do this, I do that...'
    <br>Are you actually depending on God's Spirit to worship Him?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>You say, 'I ask, I pray, I fast, I do this, I do that, I sleep in the church...'
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself: Are you actually depending on God's Spirit to worship Him?
    <br>Those who worship God without depending on God's Spirit to worship Him, worship a god they do not know.
    <br>When you worship a god you do not know, surprises come.
    <br>You ask for this; you receive another thing.
    <br>The pastor, evangelist, prayer warriors - you pray and attack comes in return.
    <br>You pray for a patient, "Be healed, be delivered" - take note of the outcome of those prayers.
    <br>You see those things around you and the things within you - satan is attacking.
    <br>You are praying for people but you...
    <br>"Be delivered, in Jesus' name" - that is the common language, your 'national anthem'.
    <br>"Be delivered, in Jesus' name" - you don't need a licence to say that; nobody will arrest you; you don't even need to be a Christian to say that.
    <br>You are free, you can just say it, nobody will query you, nobody will ask you, "Why are you calling this name when it doesn't belong to you?"
    <br>Just like going to a bookshop and buying a Bible - nobody will say, "Are you a Christian? Who are you?"
    <br>No, once you give them money, they will give you a Bible.
    <br>Those who worship God without depending on God's Spirit to do so - surprises come.
    <br>The pastor, evangelist, bishop, prophet, prayer warrior - you Christians - you pray and attack comes in return.
    <br>"Be healed, be delivered, in Jesus' name. Amen."
    <br>This is why you should not condemn; when you see anyone who says he is a pastor, leave him.
    <br>If he is not depending on God's Spirit to do what he is doing, those things will come back to him.
    <br>The repercussions are great; you will pity him.
    <br>You will cry for him as time goes on.
    <br>So, that is why I don't condemn anyone.
    <br>Anyone that says, "I'm a pastor, I'm a bishop, I'm this..." - no, don't worry; don't fight for God; you can't fight for God.
    <br>He says, "I'm a pastor, I'm an evangelist, I'm this, I'm that, a bishop; in Jesus' name, amen" - don't condemn, just be praying.
    <br>Because if he is not, he will not be able to depend on God's Spirit to worship.
    <br>If he is not a genuine pastor, he will worship God without depending on God's Spirit to do so.
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Can you see the difference?
    <br>If this man is a true servant of God, he will depend on God's Spirit to worship God.
    <br>But if he is not a true one, he will not be able to depend on God's Spirit to worship.
    <br>There's a way to call God, and there's a way to depend on God's Spirit to call God - there are two ways now.
    <br>You call Jesus, "Jesus" - there is one - another one is to depend on God's Spirit to call that name.
    <br>And the key to that name is Spirit.
    <br>To depend upon the Spirit to call Him; that is the key.
    <br>The Bible says that God's power works through His Word and His Spirit.
    <br>God's power cannot work without His Word and Spirit.
    <br>God's power cannot work only through His Word.
    <br>'I can preach very well, that's all' - God's power cannot work through only that.
    <br>It must work through His Word and His Spirit.
    <br>You can only study His Word in school but His Spirit - that is where the key is.
    <br>'I want to be a pastor' - now, I choose to go to theology school - there is nothing bad about that; it is good.
    <br>But what you will study there is His Word; you cannot get that Spirit there.
    <br>God has His own college and you can only get His Spirit in His college.
    <br>There is God's college, and that Spirit can only be attained or achieved in His college.
    <br>So, now, God's power cannot work only through His Word.
    <br>Now there are two servants: A genuine servant of God will depend on God's Spirit to call that name.
    <br>A 'self-servant', 'self-anointed', 'self-ordained', will call that name without depending on the Spirit of God.
    <br>If you are calling the name of God without depending on God's Spirit to call the name,
    <br>you are calling a god you do not know and it will come by surprise.
    <br>You get frustrated - "I fast, I pray, I do this and that; look at me" - at the end of the day you turn to a spiritualist;
    <br>you have to go to a witchdoctor to support yourself; if not, your life is finished.
    <br>You have to begin to go to a spiritualist, a witchdoctor, and put something in your pocket to add something to what you are doing, in support.
    <br>Because you see that name cannot get you anything; you cannot hear anything.
    <br>It is because you are not depending upon the Spirit to call that name.
    <br>The holy men were carried along by the Spirit to write and speak.
    <br>The Spirit must suggest to us what to say.
    <br>A suggestion from the Spirit, because God is not a man that has this flesh or blood.
    <br>He is not a man you can just walk to and call; that is why you have to go through His Spirit.
    <br>The Bible says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>It is all about Jesus we know, not the Jesus we do not know.
    <br>Worship Him in Spirit and truth.
