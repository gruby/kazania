    <br>THE WARNING GOD GAVE TB JOSHUA!!!
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is a common thing today that is really giving me so much concern:
    <br>You see people talking about their situation
    <br>and times without number we have preached about this,
    <br>that situations are not your enemy but friend.
    <br>People talk so much about their situation instead of talking about the Redeemer, Jesus Christ.
    <br>They say, "Situation, situation" - everywhere.
    <br>In my country Nigeria; they are expecting elections in a few days.
    <br>You can see many people...
    <br>Instead of talking about your Redeemer, you are talking about your challenges, your situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>You talk about your situation so much instead of your Redeemer.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Situation is not an enemy to a Christian.
    <br>Situations are meant to improve us, not impair us.
    <br>As a Christian, our struggles make us stronger.
    <br>It is meant to improve us.
    <br>Our situation is not like others’, unless you are not a believer.
    <br>When you see someone saying, "I have headache", and you too have headache,
    <br>you are a Christian, and that person is not -
    <br>your headache is not like his headache.
    <br>Your headache is meant to improve you, to strengthen your desire and your determination.
    <br>- For who?
    <br>- God.
    <br>They say, "Ah, this problem of this country is too much. What has happened?"
    <br>No.
    <br>Your problem is not like others’.
    <br>They are not meant to kill you or destroy you
    <br>but to strengthen your desire,
    <br>to strengthen your character.
    <br>Let's quickly look at John 16 - the last verse there, 33.
    <br>“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.
    <br>In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”
    <br>When you look at the Book of Luke 22:32:
    <br>“But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail…”
    <br>That is to tell you that there will always be an issue that will challenge our faith.
    <br>A true Christian, a true believer is tested.
    <br>The Book of John 16 shows that we are not in Heaven.
    <br>Something must punch us and test our faith.
    <br>It could be hardship, sickness, setback or nightmares – just name it.
    <br>Something must punch, poke and test your faith.
    <br>We are not in Heaven; we are in the world but we are not part of them.
    <br>Why are you so concerned about your situation instead of your Redeemer, Healer, Saviour?
    <br>There will always be an issue that will challenge your faith.
    <br>This is the beauty in our journey to eternal life,
    <br>the beauty in our journey with Christ Jesus.
    <br>What you see as foolish is beauty; it makes our journey valuable.
    <br>If not the situations I have gone through in the past, do you think I would be in the position I am today?
    <br>This is the beauty in our journey to eternal life,
    <br>the beauty in our journey with Christ Jesus.
    <br>That hardship, trouble, name-calling, foolish thing, sickness -
    <br>as a Christian - beauty.
    <br>Don’t forget, Jesus does not maintain what He does not form.
    <br>That is why you have to carry Him along.
    <br>Carry Him along in your marriage, business.
    <br>He does not maintain what He does not form.
    <br>Does He form your marriage?
    <br>Does He form your business?
    <br>And you are asking Him to maintain it.
    <br>You are calling Him to maintain your life, marriage...
    <br>Does He actually form it?
    <br>We misjudge ourselves when we are in circumstances and situations such as failure.
    <br>"Why me? I'm a Christian. Why all this failure, trouble?
    <br>Is it a result of my going to church? Is it a result of stopping smoking?
    <br>Is it a result of stopping going to parties, night clubs? Why? Why me?"
    <br>You begin to look at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>A TRUE CHRISTIAN IS TESTED
    <br>A man can be poor and yet be a friend of Jesus.
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We cannot separate warfare from salvation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>We cannot separate warfare from salvation.
    <br>Again.
    <br>We cannot separate warfare from salvation.
    <br>True salvation will put us into direct conflict with satan.
    <br>All these salvations you are talking about are fake.
    <br>You say you are saved.
    <br>What do you mean by being saved?
    <br>You are not saved; that is why you are like this, you are what you are.
    <br>You are not saved yet.
    <br>Salvation is not on the street.
    <br>You say you are saved - who told you?
    <br>You are still a religious person.
    <br>You talk more of your situation instead of your Redeemer.
    <br>True salvation will put you into direct conflict with satan.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>A true Christian is tested by his ability to face circumstances and situations.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>A true Christian is tested by his ability to face circumstances and situations.
    <br>Little circumstances - you run to witch doctor, just because of challenges.
    <br>From one church to another.
    <br>Open your calendar and number the churches you have attended in searching for Jesus Christ,
    <br>and yet, you are still looking for Jesus.
    <br>Can you name how many times you have been baptized?
    <br>And yet, you are searching for the Holy Ghost.
    <br>And just one baptism leads to Holy Ghost.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The true Christian, believer, true you, is tested by his ability to face circumstances and situations.
    <br>Lack of trial, temptation...
    <br>It is impossible to worship God without challenges.
    <br>Where are we going, because this is the season of challenges?
    <br>You talk more of your challenges than your Redeemer.
    <br>This is why I am here today to tell you, my brothers and sisters:
    <br>Jesus does not maintain what He does not form.
    <br>I am just here to remind you what you know already.
    <br>The business is not going well; that is why you are here today? You are wasting your time.
    <br>You should be here for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>It is that salvation that can help you maintain your miracle.
    <br>Think about maintenance.
    <br>What is maintenance?
    <br>Since morning you have been here,
    <br>you have been observing all what has been going on...
    <br>Look at the church.
    <br>What do you see there - empty seats.
    <br>Look at there - empty seats.
    <br>But million people want to enter here.
    <br>It is not the number of people that enter here that matters but the souls that are being saved.
    <br>Yes, millions want to enter.
    <br>I learned this from the Apostles of the old.
    <br>How many of them had a church?
    <br>They evangelized all over.
    <br>We are looking for crowds today, but what of the soul?
    <br>How many of us have prepared to come here today?
    <br>Even half of the people inside the church are not prepared to come here.
    <br>Maybe after sitting down, after a while they begin to think of...
    <br>"I thought I can get a woman here today. I thought I can get an MD here today.
    <br>I thought I can get some connection here. I don't know."
    <br>There are many messengers of satan here; they captured them.
    <br>You have to be very careful - those who are here for the salvation of soul.
    <br>We are not here because of your money or offering.
    <br>If we were here because of offering, that place would not be empty.
    <br>We are not here because of offerings; we are here because of the souls!
    <br>I was in revelation of recent and the Lord showed me,
    <br>"Look, Joshua, see what you are doing."
    <br>I looked at it - "Be careful!"
    <br>I said, "Yes, Sir".
    <br>"Be careful."
    <br>What should I be careful about?
    <br>"Remember, membership is not your strength.
    <br>Look for the souls. Save the soul.
    <br>Don't have the church here because of money, putting the crowd together because of money."
    <br>I said, "Yes, Sir".
    <br>So the grace we are asking for now,
    <br>this is one of the reasons why you have not been seeing me coming out.
    <br>From that entrance, by the time you enter, from there they can ask you to go;
    <br>not people but the Spirit of God will send you back.
    <br>That is the standard of church.
    <br>Read your Bible.
    <br>You enter the Apostolic ministry in the New Testament and the Old Testament -
    <br>by the time you enter, there you will be screened by the Spirit of God.
    <br>"There go, come, go, come..."
    <br>If your salvation is not yet now, from the gate, instead of people screening you -
    <br>this is what I'm asking grace for now -
    <br>not to open the gate for everyone to enter, but from the gate you will find yourself being delivered.
    <br>From there, back home.
    <br>- "No, no, I'm going."
    <br>- "Why are you not entering? What happened?"
    <br>- "I'm going."
    <br>- "Ok."
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Remember, this is an Apostolic ministry.
    <br>What is an Apostolic ministry?
    <br>The foundation of the Church is the Holy Ghost
    <br>and if it is the Holy Ghost, it is your heart that should worship, not your body.
    <br>But today bodies worship in the church – no longer the hearts of people.
    <br>Faith is of man’s heart, not of man’s body.
    <br>It is our body now that worships.
    <br>Look at me, I'm standing - what can you see?
    <br>Appearance, camouflage you are looking at, but the real person is inside
    <br>you can only see with your heart.
    <br>Can you see anything apart from this camouflage?
    <br>These are the kind of persons we are today.
    <br>This is why you will be looking at the man that is talking - "Is it of God?"
    <br>When a seed is planted, we don't know what it is.
    <br>But the same seed has germinated, and we don't know what it is, and the same tree has borne fruit.
    <br>The same fruit is what we are eating now - you see three Apostles - we are eating their fruit.
    <br>The tree has germinated and is bearing fruit now - the same fruit.
    <br>They are the ones that have been walking since morning and you have seen.
    <br>Yet, you don't know the seed.
