    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME FEAR!!! | Chris Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>when the love of God fills your heart, fear has no place in your life."
    <br>Turn to the viewers, say, "Viewers!
    <br>when the love of God fills your heart, fear has no place in your life
    <br>because perfect love casts out fear."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Once again, you are welcome to the presence of God
    <br>and you may have your seats, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Today is the very first day of December 2019.
    <br>We are on the cusp of a new year 2020.
    <br>If you remember very vividly, one year ago in December 2018, after a period of fasting and prayer,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua declared that the year 2019 was a fearful year.
    <br>You would agree with me that the events of this year 2019 have attested
    <br>to the reality of that declaration.
    <br>It has been a fearful year for those whose hopes are not centred in Christ.
    <br>Even if you look at your immediate surroundings,
    <br>what you would see is frightening.
    <br>There are expressions of fear and frustration, anger and anxiety, discouragement and despair
    <br>on the faces of citizens because of the uncertainties of life.
    <br>To put it bluntly; we are living in the end time,
    <br>where the manifestation of the spirit of fear is everywhere.
    <br>Say, "Everywhere."
    <br>Fear of loss, sickness and disease, failure, today's politics, death,
    <br>fear of moral, religious, demonic oppression - fear everywhere.
    <br>People of God, fear is a destructive tool of satan that has robbed millions of a victorious life.
    <br>Many have lost the battle today,
    <br>not because of the giants but because of the fear of that giant.
    <br>Many have even died today, not because of sickness but because of the fear of that sickness.
    <br>The fear brings torment, anguish and anxiety.
    <br>Fear weakens our determination, resolve and willpower.
    <br>Fear paralyses our potential.
    <br>Fear hinders and handicaps our lives.
    <br>Fear causes our hope to shrivel and die.
    <br>Fear increases the size of our enemy mentally and fear changes our focus
    <br>from the promise of God to the present circumstance.
    <br>When we harbour fear, when we give place to fear, we are actually giving place to the devil.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>don't give place to fear because what you fear may come upon you."
    <br>Say, "Viewers,
    <br>don't give place to fear because what we fear may come upon us."
    <br>Jesus knows this - Jesus knows that fear would try to overwhelm us
    <br>so, He has given us the tools to overcome fear.
    <br>The promise of Jesus Christ is not that He would keep us from those troubles
    <br>that cause our cares, our anxiety and unnecessary fears.
    <br>The promise of God is that He will give us enough grace to stand and resist those troubles.
    <br>So today, we must learn to get above our fears even when it seems impossible to get above our troubles.
    <br>We must deal with fear before fear deals with us.
    <br>And this brings us to the title of today's message:
    <br>FREEDOM FROM FEAR
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, in the presence of God, there is freedom from fear."
    <br>Turn with me to the Book of 2 Kings 6;
    <br>that is the proof text for today's message, from verses 14 to 17.
    <br>To provide context to this Biblical story we are about to read:
    <br>It is concerning Prophet Elisha.
    <br>He was by the Holy Spirit revealing the plots and plans of the Syrian armies in their privates
    <br>and they came together and said, "We must come and deal with this Prophet Elisha"
    <br>because he was exposing their secrets.
    <br>Now, we will take up the story from verse 14.
    <br>The Bible says:
    <br>"Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there.
    <br>They went by night and surrounded the city.
    <br>When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning,
    <br>an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city."
    <br>Naturally, Prophet Elisha and his servants were defenceless
    <br>in the face of the huge and heavily armed Syrian forces.
    <br>I mean, their numbers, the weapons at their disposal were enough to intimidate
    <br>anyone whose confidence does not come from God.
    <br>It's not surprising that the servant of Elisha lost his emotional balance
    <br>out of so much fear and agitation.
    <br>He ran to his master, he was bewildered, consumed by fear and you know what he said?
    <br>He said this:
    <br>"Oh no, my lord!"
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and say, "Oh no!"
    <br>When you say this, you have to give an expression.
    <br>You know how you feel when you got some bad news, "Oh no!"
    <br>Tell your neighbour and demonstrate, say, "Oh no!"
    <br>There are many ways you can express this, but "Oh no!" is a bad thing.
    <br>"Oh no! Not again. Why? Oh no!"
    <br>The servant of Elisha said to his master - let me read it again -
    <br>after seeing these forces surrounding them, he said,
    <br>"Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?"
    <br>Some of us here today and viewers all over the world
    <br>may be passing through an "Oh no!" moment in their lives.
    <br>Perhaps that bill has come in and you look at your finances and say,
    <br>"Oh no! How will I pay this?"
    <br>Or you have gone to the hospital and the medical report comes out with a bad diagnosis,
    <br>"Oh no! How will I get through this?"
    <br>Where you are working - everything is fine.
    <br>Suddenly, they give you a sack letter, "Oh no! What am I going to do?
    <br>How will I care for my family? How will I take care of my responsibilities? Oh no!"
    <br>When that 'Oh no!' moment strikes, the monster of fear raises its ugly head
    <br>and begins to mock you, belittle you, intimidate you, trying to scare you into submission.
    <br>If there is anyone here today who is passing through an 'Oh no!' moment,
    <br>when the trouble seems to surround them,
    <br>I want you to take a lesson from the reaction of Prophet Elisha to this circumstance.
    <br>Let's turn to verse 16.
    <br>" 'Don't be afraid,' the prophet answered.
    <br>'Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.' "
    <br>In other words, he was saying to his servant,
    <br>"Don't be frightened because fear is a thief of faith and hope."
    <br>Instead of magnifying the causes of our fears,
    <br>we ought to equip ourselves with the thoughts of God, His sovereignty, His invisible world.
    <br>If you were to see the other side, you would know that our God has made adequate provision
    <br>for us to stand the forces of the adversary.
    <br>The reaction of Prophet Elisha is instructive to every born-again Christian today
    <br>and worthy of emulation.
    <br>Whilst his servant was hot, fearful and flustered, Elisha was cool, calm and confident
    <br>because he knew the situation at hand was not a personal battle but one against his God.
    <br>He saw the trouble, he saw the armies surrounding the city,
    <br>he heard the horses as they approached,
    <br>he felt the ground quaking, shivering as the chariots drew closer.
    <br>He saw this trouble but his heart was not troubled.
    <br>While Elisha's servant was overwhelmed by fear, Elisha overcame his fear.
    <br>" 'Don't be afraid,' the prophet answered.
    <br>'Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.' "
    <br>Prophet Elisha and his servants saw the same army but their reactions were different.
    <br>Just like David and the Israelites saw the same giant, Goliath, but their reactions were different.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is your giant today?
    <br>It may be sickness, disappointment, failure at the point of breakthrough.
    <br>People of God, know this: it is not the giant you face that will conquer you;
    <br>it is the giant you fear.
    <br>The lesson we take from Prophet Elisha in this Scripture is simple.
    <br>When you fix your eyes on your situation, your fears will flourish.
    <br>But when you fix your eyes on God, your fears will vanish.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The problem so many of us have today is that we magnify our trouble above God,
    <br>as if He is unable to intervene, as if He is unable to take care of that situation.
    <br>Listen, people of God!
    <br>Faith does not deny the existence of a problem; faith magnifies God above that problem.
    <br>Faith does not ignore the existence of that trouble; faith glorifies God in the midst of that trouble
    <br>and that trouble ends up working for our advancement.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Freedom from fear."
    <br>When you focus only on your problem, it will become bigger than what you can handle,
    <br>leading to fear.
    <br>I want to show you something very practically.
    <br>This is an unusual demonstration so I hope it works.
    <br>This is a blindfold
    <br>and I want to show you the devastating consequences of focusing on your problems
    <br>and submitting to fear.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Has anyone ever been in pitch black?
    <br>Maybe they have taken the light, you don't have a torch or any form of light,
    <br>you are completely in the dark as in the middle of the night.
    <br>Focusing only on our problem blinds us from reality and binds us with the spirit of fear.
    <br>In the dark we are bound to be frightened.
    <br>Right now, even to take a step forward, I can't see in front of me.
    <br>This is what happens when you focus on your problem.
    <br>You can easily injure yourself because you can't see ahead of you.
    <br>When you are blinded by your problem, you can easily fall down
    <br>because there is nothing to guide you.
    <br>When you are blinded by focusing on your problem,
    <br>the voice of satan becomes louder,
    <br>the voice of fear becomes stronger.
    <br>Even to get up is a challenge because you can't see in front of you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Focusing on our problem only, blinds us from reality and binds us to the spirit of fear.
    <br>I don't know how to get back to the Bible.
    <br>Turn with me to verse 17.
    <br>Am I close?
    <br>No.
    <br>Someone is going to have to help me.
    <br>Can someone read verse 2 Kings 6:17?
    <br>If someone can help me read that Scripture aloud
    <br>because that contains the answer to the fear.
    <br>"And Elisha prayed, and said, "Lord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see."
    <br>Open his eyes so that he may see!
    <br>"Then the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw.
    <br>And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha."
    <br>What does this mean, brethren?
    <br>The opening of the eyes of our faith is the silencing of our fears.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The clearer sight we have of the power and purity of Heaven,
    <br>the sovereignty and supremacy of God,
    <br>the less we shall fear the cares and calamities of this world.
    <br>For then, we would be able to understand that the protecting hands of Heaven
    <br>have been commissioned to help us, to fight for us and to protect us, whatever happens.
    <br>Where then is room for fear?
    <br>If God be for us, who can be against us?
    <br>Nobody.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The eyes of your faith need to be opened.
    <br>Your present eyes may see darkness
    <br>but as a Christian, the eyes of faith can see the light.
    <br>It may look like setback but the eyes of faith can see success.
    <br>It may look like disappointment
    <br>but the eyes of faith can see the divine appointment that Heaven is arranging for you.
    <br>It may look like failure but the eyes of faith can see the fulfilment in Christ
    <br>that is waiting for you as long as you persevere.
    <br>Fear not; don't be afraid, for fear is a thief of faith and hope.
    <br>People of God,
    <br>if you serve the Lord in truth and faith, nothing outside of God's control can happen to you.
    <br>You will be safe under the Rock of His refuge,
    <br>you will be sheltered under the shadow of His protection,
    <br>you will be delivered not only from evil but from the fear of it.
    <br>Therefore, whatever satan throws your way,
    <br>whatever situation or circumstance you may be facing today,
    <br>whatever 'Oh no!' moment is in your life,
    <br>no matter how giant is that giant that stands before you,
    <br>no matter how troubling that trouble is that surrounds you,
    <br>no matter how painful that pain is that pierces you -
    <br>know this people of God:
    <br>Greater is He that is in you than all the forces that can be arrayed against you.
    <br>As a child of God, if they give me a sack letter, I'm simply being prepared for a better position.
    <br>As a child of God, they diagnose me with that sickness,
    <br>I'm simply being equipped to manage good health.
    <br>My body may get sick with fever but my heart won't get sick with fear.
    <br>My symptoms may point to death but God's Word points me to life.
    <br>They may belittle you, intimidate you, call you names that are not yours,
    <br>try to frustrate you at every turn
    <br>but as a child of God, you are simply being refined in the fire of life
    <br>before coming forth as gold.
    <br>In conclusion:
    <br>Millions today have surrendered to their fears while their hearts dream of miracle.
    <br>Millions have succumbed to their fears while their hearts yearn for their destiny.
    <br>Don't let this happen to you today!
    <br>2 Timothy 1:7 says that God has not given us the spirit of fear
    <br>but of love, of power and of a sound mind.
    <br>You have a Friend - the Holy Spirit - who can help you to defeat the monster of fear.
    <br>By placing Jesus first in your heart, by meditating on what you read in the Bible,
    <br>by focusing on God instead of your problems, you can overcome fear.
    <br>So I advise you:
    <br>Meditate on each Word; turn it over and over and over again in your heart
    <br>and you will find that faith comes spontaneously and fear leaves naturally.
    <br>Your life in the Spirit will cause fear to dissolve from your life.
    <br>So, let us learn to get above our fears, even when it seems impossible to get above our troubles
    <br>by leaving the battle for God.
    <br>If you leave everything in God's hands, you will soon see God's hands in everything.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And this is how to have freedom from fear.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
