    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance in Jesus' name
    <br>to the people who have come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>in need of God's divine touch in their lives.
    <br>As he moves, whatever that is not of God in their lives is being uprooted, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's watch what happens as Prophet T.B. Joshua approaches this young man.
    <br>Do you want to hit me with this thing?
    <br>Stretch it!
    <br>Why did you remove it? Do you want to hit me with it?
    <br>No.
    <br>- Come here!
    <br>- Watch your screen.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>You can see the man armed with the charm.
    <br>HE HID THIS IN HIS UNDERWEAR
    <br>Until He Met T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>See what he is carrying in his hand.
    <br>You took it from where? Put it back there.
    <br>HE HID THIS IN HIS UNDERWEAR
    <br>Until He Met T.B. Joshua!!!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>- Move!
    <br>- You can see him shaking.
    <br>He came here today with a charm.
    <br>The Holy Spirit has disarmed him. Right now, you can see what is happening.
    <br>Satan is powerless in the face of God's armour.
    <br>My name is Usman.
    <br>What I am holding is a charm.
    <br>I got it from a cult that I joined.
    <br>Tell us what happened to you as the man of God was approaching you. What happened?
    <br>When the man of God was coming, the place became unbearable for me.
    <br>I started experiencing fire around me. That was why I brought it out.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Usman.
    <br>I was the man that brought out the charm last week during the Sunday Service
    <br>when the man of God was praying for people.
    <br>I'm a business man.
    <br>One of my friends came to me and said that he liked the business that I was doing
    <br>and that he wanted to be my partner.
    <br>I said, "Ok, but I don't have capital; I don't have any money".
    <br>He said that since I had the idea, he would provide the money.
    <br>So he gave me the sum of Naira 500,000.
    <br>I appointed a man who was supposed to take care of the business for me.
    <br>I entrusted him with a lot and I trusted him.
    <br>He introduced a friend of his to me,  and I gave him a sum of 500,000 naira.
    <br>Before I realised what had happened, he disappeared with my money.
    <br>I tried to call him, but to no avail.
    <br>Later, my friend came to my house and asked me, "What about the business?".
    <br>I said, "This is what I am passing through at the moment.
    <br>A man that I wanted to use, duped me and ran away with the money".
    <br>He failed to understand how this could have happened to me.
    <br>He brought security people to my house.
    <br>Each day they would beat me, molest me and embarrass me until I could not bear the pain any longer.
    <br>That is when I met another friend and told him what I was passing through.
    <br>He told me that he would introduce me to a herbalist, and he took me there.
    <br>When I met the herbalist, I explained everything to him.
    <br>The herbalist told me that he would prepare a charm for me.
    <br>After preparing the charm for me, he said that if I wanted to kill my partner,
    <br>I should call his name three times and make some incantations,
    <br>and he would have an accident or just die on his own.
    <br>When I got back home, I found my wife watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I told her that I had already warned her numerous times not to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>She said, "Please my husband, sit down for a moment and hear what this man is saying".
    <br>That is when God got involved in my case.
    <br>I sat down with my wife.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was preaching about forgiveness,
    <br>saying that if you really want to progress and move forward in life,
    <br>we have to forgive one another.
    <br>From that moment, I started having a double mind.
    <br>Each time I took the charm to kill him, I would keep thinking about what Prophet T.B. Joshua said about forgiveness.
    <br>HE HID THIS IN HIS UNDERWEAR
    <br>Until He Met TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Although I kept thinking about forgiveness,
    <br>I did not explain to my wife that this is what I was thinking about.
    <br>Do you mean that your wife did not even know about the charm that you wanted to use to destroy someone's life?
    <br>She did not know; she was not aware that I brought a charm to the house.
    <br>Last week Sunday, I decided that no matter what happened, I would to come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>because I could not just get rid of or burn the charm, as I did not know what would happen -
    <br>it could result in a big calamity on my family.
    <br>I decided that because Prophet T.B. Joshua preached about forgiveness, I would go and give him the charm,
    <br>and explain what I was passing through.
    <br>I would ask him to help me and deliver me
    <br>because I could not throw the charm away.
    <br>When I came to the church, he was praying for people.
    <br>He was not even supposed to go to the section where I was, but God has His own way of doing things.
    <br>He now diverted to where I was.
    <br>There were five people ahead me, so he wasn't close to me.
    <br>But when he came towards me, I could not bear the fire I felt around me.
    <br>I can't explain the fire, but I know what I experienced.
    <br>I hid the charm in my underwear and not in the trouser that I wore.
    <br>That is why the security did not discover it.
    <br>Since your deliverance last Sunday,
    <br>can you please share with us what your experience is now compared to your experience before you came here.
    <br>Before praying for me, even before he preached about forgiveness,
    <br>I had a double mind.
    <br>I had serious nightmares and could not sleep, as my heart was troubling me.
    <br>After my deliverance, I have been sleeping like a newborn baby.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>HE HID THIS IN HIS UNDERWEAR
    <br>Until He Met TB Joshua!!!
    <br>I am sleeping like a newborn baby and I am only thinking about Jesus Christ.
    <br>I want to use this medium to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>If Christianity is being practised like this, I don't think that the youth would not go to church.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>You mean, you came here and you discovered Christianity in practicality? Right?
    <br>Yes, because it has been more than five years since the last time I went to church.
    <br>I didn't go to church at all.
    <br>The advice I have for people: No matter what has happened to you,
    <br>whether you are or are not the cause of the issue,
    <br>find a way in your heart to forgive the offender.
    <br>If you do not forgive, God will not forgive you.
    <br>I thank God for saving me and for saving my family.
    <br>Do you still have nightmares?
    <br>I have not had nightmares again.
    <br>And the thoughts of killing and destruction?
    <br>It is out of my life.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?
    <br>HE HID THIS IN HIS UNDERWEAR
    <br>Until He Met TB Joshua!!!
    <br>And now that God Almighty has set you free,
    <br>remember the deliverance you have received is for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>The greatest decision a man can ever make is what he will do with Christ.
    <br>And now, obey Him, make His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>And we pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>As you do so, your deliverance will remain permanent.
    <br>And whatever that is left in your life, God Almighty is more than able to settle your case and to solve your problems,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Once again, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
