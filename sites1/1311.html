    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Let someone say, "I am under His eyes".
    <br>Say, "I am under His eyes; nothing out of God's control can happen to me.
    <br>I am safe!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Give thanks to Him once again!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, there are two sides to life.
    <br>First, we have the spiritual side -
    <br>the ultimate conclusion where satan was defeated.
    <br>Second, we have the natural side -
    <br>where people try to figure God out with their natural mind.
    <br>When these two dimensions of life are clearly discerned,
    <br>only then will we be able to navigate and negotiate the spiritual war around us.
    <br>We are not fighting flesh and blood;
    <br>we are not fighting people with flesh and blood.
    <br>We are fighting someone without a body.
    <br>We are fighting spirit beings - spirit to spirit.
    <br>The battle is the Lord's.
    <br>The believer who walks in the natural is no match for satan.
    <br>But glory be to God Almighty that victory is ours.
    <br>Let someone say, "Victory is mine".
    <br>The natural man, the man of the intellect, cannot understand
    <br>or receive the things of the Spirit of God.
    <br>That's why the Bible urges every believer today to get their eyes fixed
    <br>not on what is seen but on what is unseen.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, walk by faith, not by sight".
    <br>A Christian should be careful of what he's looking at
    <br>because what he is looking at can influence his thoughts and his future actions.
    <br>Life is a warfare.
    <br>Life is a battlefield, where only the serious-minded can be victorious.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Life is a battlefield, where only the serious-minded are victorious.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you ready for the battle?
    <br>Neighbour, get your heart set.
    <br>Get your mind set."
    <br>This leads us to our message this morning: THE BATTLE IN YOUR THOUGHTS.
    <br>Let someone say, "The battle in your thoughts".
    <br>Let me take you to our proof text, the book of 2 Corinthians 10.
    <br>I will start my reading from verse 2.
    <br>"But I beg you that when I am present I may not be bold with that confidence
    <br>by which I intend to be bold against some,
    <br>who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh."
    <br>Verse 3.
    <br>"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh."
    <br>Verse 4.
    <br>"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds,
    <br>casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God,
    <br>bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ..."
    <br>Bringing every thought into captivity of the obedience to Christ.
    <br>The devil is our common enemy
    <br>but he hates our looking at things from God's point of view,
    <br>because he knows that the man who learns to walk in Christ Jesus,
    <br>in faith, has satan under his feet.
    <br>That is why he does not want any believer to walk in faith
    <br>but rather he wants them to walk by sight.
    <br>The battle we face in our daily living is with our senses -
    <br>what you see, what you hear and what your circumstances look like.
    <br>Our senses point us to the physical world, to the natural world,
    <br>whereas the Bible says the believer does not have strength as long as he operates in the natural.
    <br>The believer does not have strength as long as he operates,
    <br>he makes decisions in the natural.
    <br>Those who rely on sense knowledge cannot see beyond now.
    <br>But those who operate in the spirit are those who rely on revelation truth.
    <br>I mean the mind of God, through the revealing Word of God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, we don't walk by sight but by faith.
    <br>Walk by faith, not by sight".
    <br>Let me give you an example: In the Book of Matthew 16, it is all about Simon Peter.
    <br>Matthew chapter 16 from verse 15.
    <br>Jesus asked, "Who do people say I am?"
    <br>Simon said, "One of the prophets".
    <br>But Jesus looked around his disciples and asked them, "You, who do you say I am?"
    <br>Verse 16.
    <br>Simon Peter listened to his divine nature;
    <br>I mean, he listened to the testimony of his heart and
    <br>upon hearing the revealing Word of God, he confessed Christ as the Son of the Living God
    <br>and received approval and blessing from Jesus.
    <br>But in the other moment in verse 23, when Jesus predicted His death at the Cross
    <br>for the salvation of our souls, to fulfill the Scripture,
    <br>the same Simon Peter listened to the feelings of his human nature and stood against the Lord
    <br>and Jesus said, "Get behind me, satan, for you are mindful not of the things of God but of man".
    <br>What does this mean to you and me?
    <br>Looking at life, its storms and adversities from the natural or human point of view
    <br>is a trap of the enemy to derail you from your natural focus.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, looking at life, its storms, its troubles and its adversities
    <br>from the human point of view is a trap of the enemy to derail you from your focus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, watch and pray".
    <br>Man's conscience is God's instrument for discernment.
    <br>My heart, my conscience is God's instrument for discernment - therefore, watch!
    <br>Our heart is the watchman.
    <br>Your heart is the watchman.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "I do not see satan in the natural; I see him in the spiritual realm".
    <br>Therefore, if your heart sleeps, the devil takes the opportunity to attack.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What makes your heart sleep? Ask your neighbour.
    <br>"Neighbour, what makes your heart sleep?"
    <br>Negative thoughts, anger, offence, fits of rage.
    <br>These are the things that make your heart sleep because they damage the heart.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, discipline your heart".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, take care of your heart.
    <br>Watch over your heart".
    <br>Why?
    <br>Our heart is the realm of desires and emotions.
    <br>Vain and idle thoughts are products of a vain and idle heart.
    <br>Vain and idle thoughts and words are products of a vain and idle heart;
    <br>therefore, discipline your heart.
    <br>Because only dedication and discipline are the fruit of victory
    <br>to overcome the battle of thoughts raging within you.
    <br>Dedication and discipline are the means of victory
    <br>against the battle of thoughts going on inside of you.
    <br>Therefore, capture your thoughts for the glory of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How do we discipline our heart?
    <br>As you are sitting down, many thoughts are going on.
    <br>You are here because you face a giant.
    <br>You are here saying, "When will I separate myself from this woman?"
    <br>Shall I divorce her? Shall I leave?
    <br>Shall I close this business? Shall I have another one?"
    <br>Many thoughts are going on in our hearts today.
    <br>Discipline your heart.
    <br>How do we discipline our heart?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "Give your heart a job; don't let your heart give you a job".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, give your heart a job; don't let your heart give you a job".
    <br>If you don't give an assignment to your heart, your heart will give an assignment to itself.
    <br>Your heart will keep roaming about, taking you to the past,
    <br>from one thought to another and put you into trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Discipline your heart to become your servant, not your master
    <br>so that you can be able to concentrate on the things that are in the spirit.
    <br>Discipline your heart; discipline your mind.
    <br>Discipline your heart to become your servant not your master so that you can think,
    <br>concentrate on the things of the Spirit because your thoughts have presence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What does it mean that your thoughts have presence?
    <br>There are many thoughts going through your heart today.
    <br>That thought will lead you to action.
    <br>That thought can lead you to success or failure because man exercises the will through the mind.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, your thoughts have presence".
    <br>This means, what happens in your heart will happen in time
    <br>because our life reflects what is in our heart.
    <br>What happens in your heart will happen in time because our life reflects what is in our heart.
    <br>This means our lives will always go to the level of our thoughts
    <br>because our words and our actions express our thoughts, which are the seeds of our lives.
    <br>Your life will always go to the level of your thoughts
    <br>because your words and your actions express your thoughts, which are the seeds of your life.
    <br>A man's life is what his thoughts make it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A man's life is what he is thinking all day long.
    <br>What you are thinking about - within you - that is where the unending battle starts.
    <br>It is only by making what is right that can get you to the victory in this unending spiritual warfare.
    <br>It is only by the right choice you make that can take you to victory
    <br>in the face of this endless spiritual warfare.
    <br>It is an unending battle, an unending warfare.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because we battle with our thoughts throughout our lifetime.
    <br>My heart is the communication point, contact point,
    <br>between God's suggestion to do what is right or the devil's suggestion to do what is wrong.
    <br>Our thoughts have presence.
    <br>Let someone say, "A man's life is what his thoughts make it".
    <br>There will be a constant battle of thoughts in your heart.
    <br>You have to be ready for the battle and face it.
    <br>There are two opposing forces: Right and wrong, faith and doubt, good and evil.
    <br>Say, "Brethren, great thoughts produce great decisions".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Victory is mine because I am not alone; the battle is the Lord's.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, who is your strength?
    <br>The Lord is my strength".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The battle on the outside is only a reflection of the battle on the inside.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me give you an example.
    <br>In the Book of 2 Kings 6:15-16, let's look at the notable biblical hero Prophet Elisha.
    <br>The Bible says, there was a war going on.
    <br>And any time the king of the opposing army was setting up his strategy in his room,
    <br>talking to his generals, all his plan was revealed to Israel.
    <br>They said, "Who is betraying us?"; someone said, "It is the Prophet Elisha
    <br>who is revealing far away the word you are speaking in your bedroom".
    <br>They said, "Let's go and catch him".
    <br>When they woke up in the morning, the town was surrounded by armies.
    <br>The servant of the prophet saw it and got overwhelmed and scared.
    <br>Naturally, Prophet Elisha and his servant were defenceless
    <br>in the face of the heavily armed Syrian army.
    <br>That is why it was not a surprise to see his servant lose balance and emotion
    <br>out of much agitation and fear.
    <br>Because he concentrated, he focused on what the immediate situation was saying,
    <br>not on what God had to say.
    <br>But Elisha, being a man of faith, remained calm, calculated and determined.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because he was able to see beyond the situation at hand.
    <br>He was able to be calm and determined because he was able to see the other side.
    <br>Let someone say, "See the other side".
    <br>When he saw the spiritual realm, he knew that his God
    <br>had made adequate provision for him to face the enemy
    <br>and God gave him the victory, total victory, absolute victory.
    <br>Let someone say, "God is faithful".
    <br>Encourage your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, fear not".
    <br>No matter your trouble, you are in His presence;
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When the prophet saw his servant was frightened, he said to him,
    <br>"Do not be afraid of the calamities of this world, because fear brings torment, anguish, anxiety".
    <br>Rather than magnifying the cause of your fear, equip yourself with the thoughts of God.
    <br>Let someone say, "The thoughts of God".
    <br>Let someone say, "The mind of Christ; the mind of God".
    <br>You have to know God's opinion over your situation - that's the key, that's the way out.
    <br>Brethren, no matter the war going on inside of you, right now as you're listening to me,
    <br>no matter your giant, we have a Friend -
    <br>the man of God calls Him the Wonderful Unseen Guest - the Holy Spirit,
    <br>who will conquer every giant in your life today.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Say, "I am not alone!"
    <br>Brethren, if the One who overcomes dwells in you,
    <br>you will overcome every obstacle today, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Now, what is the lesson of this.
    <br>When you know God's opinion about your situation, life, business, marriage,
    <br>you will fear no more, worry no more, doubt no more
    <br>because that will impart a strength to endure whatever you're going through
    <br>because Someone is aware.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Finally, brethren, faith is the means of victory in this battle of thoughts.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Faith comes when the Word of God prevails over the thinking processes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, get ready for the victory!"
    <br>Are you ready for the victory?
    <br>Remember, David wasn't afraid.
    <br>Are you ready for the victory?
    <br>Say, "Victory is mine today".
    <br>Say, "Today, my enemy has made a big mistake
    <br>by allowing me to be here in the presence of the Lord!"
    <br>Today, you are more than a conqueror!
    <br>You will overcome!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "There is a difference between meditation and thinking".
    <br>He says meditation has to do with the knowledge of Heaven,
    <br>knowledge of the will of God in your matter, through the revealing Word of God.
    <br>Thinking has to do with the senses, with the problem at hand.
    <br>That's why thinking leads to depression.
    <br>It damages the heart;
    <br>it brings worry and worrying destroys our sense of judgement.
    <br>The Bible says as you meditate on the Word of God,
    <br>you will overcome every negative thought.
    <br>As you meditate on the Word of God, you will overcome every negative thought.
    <br>Those negative thoughts triggered by satan may persist in staying
    <br>but refuse to accommodate those thoughts, refuse to put them into words and they will die unborn.
    <br>The Scriptures say, submit to God and resist the evil one.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the way out for you has come.
    <br>The way out for me has come".
    <br>No matter what happens, no matter what comes, speak only the Word of God,
    <br>speak only the Word of faith over your situation, marriage, business, health,
    <br>over every aspect of your life.
    <br>If your heart and mind are filled with the Word of Jesus,
    <br>you will overcome every obstacle in your life,
    <br>you will overcome every trial that comes upon your way!
    <br>And such will be your case today, if you believe.
    <br>Do you believe?
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Begin to rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Any moment from now, you will begin to see the name of Jesus Christ working in the Spirit.
    <br>You will see the Living Word of God working in the Spirit - uprooting, tearing down,
    <br>destroying all the strongholds of the devil against your life.
    <br>You will see His power and anointing that breaks the yoke.
    <br>Therefore, take heart.
    <br>Let someone say, "Take heart".
    <br>Jesus cares because Jesus sees.
    <br>He knows you; He knows your past, present and future.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
