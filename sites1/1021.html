  <p>    
    <br>Madam, come.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>There is a decision within you that you want to take.
    <br>You are asking God whether you should take this decision or not.
    <br>Very true.
    <br>It's not right.
    <br>Ask God; no matter what happens, God's decision is what matters.
    <br>The situation cannot make you say you want to quit.
    <br>Situation should not make you quit.
    <br>Let God release you; situation should not release you.
    <br>Ok?
    <br>You have taken one leg out; another leg is inside.
    <br>So please...
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>I want to see you. Where is your husband?
    <br>He is here.
    <br>Call him.
    <br>Bongani, come.
    <br>Ok, you are the one.
    <br>I hope you are not annoyed that I'm talking to your wife.
    <br>I am not annoyed.
    <br>It is something that only God knows - the secret, hidden things.
    <br>This is an issue that only she thought of.
    <br>It has not been pronounced out but it is a decision from the heart.
    <br>She is tired of the marriage.
    <br>You know the reason she is crying? She never wanted you to know
    <br>because she doesn't want to hurt you.
    <br>The way she is going now, she will shock you.
    <br>Shock you in the sense that you will just find that you are alone.
    <br>So, now, this is God's revelation.
    <br>You just find that you are out, before you come back, the house is empty.
    <br>I've been praying, I wanted to quit but I said that I must first come to The SCOAN, before I go.
    <br>I wanted to quit, Prophet.
    <br>Don't worry, it is not you, it is the spirit; the spirit does not want you to stay.
    <br>You know you have had a lot of disappointments.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This is not your first attempt.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You were with a woman before.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And that one broke and this one too will break.
    <br>Only God can hold it.
    <br>This is not your first woman, you had one before - it broke.
    <br>Now, this is another and herself too has a broken home.
    <br>Very true.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>The problem you people have, the way she quit her former relationship,
    <br>it was not God who released her.
    <br>It was bitterness and disagreement that caused it.
    <br>Yours - you were not released here, she was not released there and the two of you are together.
    <br>This is what is affecting the relationship.
    <br>I will see you, okay?
    <br>There is a medical report about you - you are battling with trouble.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Okay, so I will see you later. Go and wait for me.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>So we want to listen to them right now. Madam, you're welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Please introduce yourself to us and also the gentleman beside you.
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Mrs Katherine Tetiwa. I am a Zimbabwean residing in South Africa.
    <br>On Saturday during the prophetic service, the man of God called me out.
    <br>I got so relieved because I had been praying for that day, for that moment.
    <br>The man of God said to me, "I can see you want to leave your marriage and you are tired of it".
    <br>The prophecy - it was 100% correct.
    <br>Sorry, Madam, before you go on, who is the gentleman beside you?
    <br>The man  beside me is my husband.
    <br>Okay. Just go ahead, Madam.
    <br>The man of God said to me that I was tired of this marriage.
    <br>He could see one leg being in, one leg being out, meaning that I was still deciding what to do.
    <br>Our problem started three years ago when I got married to my husband.
    <br>But before that, the man of God prophesied to me that this was my third marriage.
    <br>I had two broken marriages before and it was 100% true.
    <br>I broke off my first marriage because of lack of affection.
    <br>My second marriage - it was the same.
    <br>In this third one, it's the same again.
    <br>I want the man of God to help me because I cannot see myself leaving my marriage again.
    <br>I have been praying very hard.
    <br>My prayer was, "God, I know You are going to answer my prayer in a mighty way".
    <br>Okay. So, Madam, we just want to understand clearly.
    <br>You said that this is actually your third marriage. Is that correct?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Okay. Just describe to us - what were the major problems that caused the breakage
    <br>of your first two marriages?
    <br>The first one - it was bitterness and lack of affection.
    <br>The second one - it was the same.
    <br>In the second one, he didn't chase me out of the house.
    <br>I was the one who packed my bags and left the house.
    <br>So now entering into the third marriage, you said that the same problem continued.
    <br>Could you just describe what the challenges were
    <br>that you were having in your house with your current husband?
    <br>At first, things were going on well.
    <br>Two years ago, we stayed with my husbandÂ´s son.
    <br>But we started to have arguments in the house.
    <br>There were no fights with the son but the atmosphere just changed.
    <br>When he left, we could not fight. If you saw us, you could not tell that we could fight.
    <br>We could talk, we could do everything but he started not giving me money when I asked for money.
    <br>He started telling me I could leave the house. If I wanted, he would never look for me again.
    <br>I said to myself, "There is no way I can still live with this man".
    <br>The affection just disappeared from that time.
    <br>We could spend two months without meeting as husband and wife.
    <br>Okay, so people on the outside would look at you, they would not know there was a problem
    <br>but deep down, in the roots of the marriage, there were serious disagreements,
    <br>no affection and you actually, in your heart, were planning on leaving the marriage. Is that right?
    <br>I didn't even tell him that I wanted to leave but I could hold on his words.
    <br>I could see his behaviour.
    <br>Then I was...
    <br>I didn't know what to do but, deep down in my heart, I was like, "One day, I'll leave this marriage".
    <br>But when I started to watch Emmanuel TV, I was seeing people being delivered.
    <br>I didn't say I was perfect but I was like,
    <br>"Maybe there's something seriously wrong with me because this is the third marriage.
    <br>When I go to The SCOAN, I will get my deliverance and I know things will get to normal".
    <br>When I was sitting there, my prayer was, "If the man of God does not address this,
    <br>after leaving from here, I'm just going to pack my bags and go".
    <br>Okay. So people of God, we can understand the power of that prophetic word.
    <br>This was a decision that she had discussed or disclosed to no one.
    <br>It was in the depths of her heart. Even her husband was not aware.
    <br>But the man of God walked straight up to her and said there was this decision that she wanted to take
    <br>concerning her marriage and we know that as the prophecy has come forth,
    <br>our sister said they have come to seek the face of God.
    <br>We know that the solution from God will also come alongside the prophecy.
    <br>So right now, we would like to hear a word from your husband as well.
    <br>Sir, you're very welcome. Please introduce yourself to us and the lady beside you
    <br>and share your own experiences concerning that prophetic word.
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Bongani Mvumi.
    <br>The woman beside me is my wife.
    <br>I'm from South Africa.
    <br>As it was mentioned, this is my second marriage.
    <br>When she was prophesied to, she actually called me beside her
    <br>and the prophet picked up that I married and remarried,
    <br>which meant that I also had a previous marriage.
    <br>So this is actually my second marriage.
    <br>The prophet also said that there have been disappointments in my life.
    <br>He also picked up that I've got a high medical report
    <br>which is very true because I've got high cholesterol.
    <br>I then said to myself, "It is good that the man of God has picked up all those things
    <br>and God is going to address our issues".
    <br>And indeed..
    <br>The problem that started in my family was that -
    <br>specifically when we started staying with my son.
    <br>My wife did not want to accept us staying with my son
    <br>because she had certain suspicions that my son would go back to his mother
    <br>and pick up some things which would be brought into the house and disturb our marriage.
    <br>And because I've got this affection for my children.
    <br>I loved my son and my affection for her started deteriorating. I started becoming very weak,
    <br>and I did not have any affection for her for quite some time.
    <br>And this is why we came here so that God can address our challenges that we are facing.
    <br>So what was the situation in the house before coming to The SCOAN
    <br>in terms of your relationship with your wife?
    <br>Before we came to The SCOAN, the situation was not that tense.
    <br>Like she indicated, we did communicate, we did speak but the affection went down.
    <br>We could just live together but there was no affection.
    <br>So sir, were you surprised when the man of God went straight to your wife
    <br>and told her about this decision that she was planning to take within.
    <br>I mean, did you know anything about this? Were you aware of this?
    <br>As far as that decision is concerned, I was quite surprised.
    <br>I didn't know that she was contemplating to quit the marriage
    <br>because I thought we could still give it another chance.
    <br>And now that we came here to The SCOAN, God is going to answer our prayers
    <br>and He is going to address this marriage to become the marriage that God actually envisages.
    <br>Hallelujah! Once again, this is just an experience in life that we're listening to from the couple here
    <br>and it's a great lesson for our viewers all over the world and those of us present here,
    <br>really demonstrating the recent teaching that the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua has been sharing with us
    <br>about the need for God to release us from relationships, not situations or circumstances
    <br>because if you leave a relationship embittered and offended,
    <br>you will enter the next relationship in the same way.
    <br>And you will see the problems from the first will simply carry over into the next one
    <br>because healing needs to take place.
    <br>And I believe the case of our couple here is a great example of this.
    <br>But we thank God that it was in the house of God that this was revealed.
    <br>And definitely as the prophecy has come forth from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>we know that solution, in the name of Jesus Christ, and divine intervention have also come in.
    <br>Sir, just tell us - since that word of prophecy, how is your body right now?
    <br>How is everything with your life after that prophecy?
    <br>Since I met the man of God, after the prophecy,
    <br>I'm quite feeling better in terms of my body.
    <br>Glory be to God! We know our brother said that he was suffering from health challenges as well
    <br>which the man of God identified in the prophecy and we thank God that he's already seen
    <br>the changes in terms of his physical system and we know that the best is yet to come.
    <br>Now as you're here, sir, can we hear from you?
    <br>What is it that you are seeking from God
    <br>concerning the next step to take in your marital relationship?
    <br>I'm seeking for God to reveal that this is the marriage that I should be in
    <br>so that we conduct ourselves according to God's will.
    <br>Hallelujah!  Well, as we mentioned earlier, we know that God has spoken in this word of prophecy.
    <br>And we know the opinion of God will be revealed concerning this situation.
    <br>Sir, we'd like to finally ask you: What is your word of advice based on your own life experience
    <br>as someone who has passed through this broken home
    <br>and now seen similar problems emerge in your current relationship?
    <br>What do you want to advise our viewers all over the world
    <br>about this area of marriage and relationships based on your own personal experiences
    <br>and that word of prophecy that you received last week?
    <br>My advice to viewers all over the world and in this church is that
    <br>no one can address the problems that we are facing. It's only God.
    <br>Let's all run to God. He is the only person who has got the answers.  With God, nothing is imposible.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Madam, we'd like to hear your own side as well, based on your own life experience,
    <br>and we thank God that you are here today in the arena of liberty.
    <br>God has touched your situation.
    <br>What is your own word of advice to our viewers all over the world concerning this very sensitive issue?
    <br>My advice is that in every situation, we must run to God.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So we've heard it from this couple. We know they've come to hear the opinion of God
    <br>and we believe that very soon you will see this couple back here to share their testimony
    <br>of what Jesus Christ has revealed and the next step they've taken in the light of that.
    <br>So we will rest the case for here, knowing that we are going to hear from them very soon
    <br>to the glory of God about what Jesus has done in their marital lives
    <br>through coming to The SCOAN and receiving that word of prophecy
    <br>We just want to encourage both of you to continue to make the Word of God the standard for your lives
    <br>and we know as you do that, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
