    <br>Viewers, are you there?
    <br>Whatever medium you are using to view us at this moment,
    <br>just believe with God, all things are possible.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, are you still holding any pain of the past or unforgiveness?
    <br>Ask Jesus Christ to make you a channel of pardon where there is injury.
    <br>Ask Jesus to make you a channel of forgiveness where there is unforgiveness;
    <br>a channel of love where there is hatred,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name, we pray.

    <br>I have come, oh Lord.
    <br>Deliver me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Deliver me, in the name of Jesus from that spirit that holds my health,
    <br>from that spirit that holds my marriage,
    <br>from that spirit that holds my family,
    <br>from that spirit that holds my finances,
    <br>from that spirit that holds my career,
    <br>from that spirit that holds my future.
