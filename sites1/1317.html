  <p>    
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Praise the living Jesus!
    <br>Greet your neighbour - Good Morning!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Greet the next person besides you, say "Good Morning!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we greet you Good Morning, in Jesus' name!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Make sure your heart is not fearful.
    <br>Make sure your heart is free from worry.
    <br>Be conscious that you are welcome.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Be conscious!
    <br>Be conscious that you are welcome, in Jesus' name!
    <br>In Jesus' name !
    <br>The SCOAN  Sunday Service
    <br>Today, we treasure so much our worldly possessions
    <br>such as cars, houses, clothes, shoes, jewellery and properties.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is our daily prayer to have them in abundance.
    <br>We care for them; we do not want them to fade because of how much they mean to us.
    <br>But there is one thing we never care for, that never fades away -
    <br>the heart, the main man, the man himself.
    <br>Do you give the same concern, the same care to your heart -
    <br>God's contact, the communication point, God's prayer room, God's treasure.
    <br>We can tell how men look but God can tell what they are.
    <br>Our appearance is but a camouflage.
    <br>The Bible says what God values in man is beyond human discernment,
    <br>which is planted in the heart.
    <br>It is good to look good but do not forget about the real thing
    <br>which is God's treasure.
    <br>Because the Bible says in the Book of Matthew 12:35
    <br>that it is the character of good man that he has a good treasure in his heart
    <br>and from there he brings forth good things -
    <br>love, joy, faithfulness, tenderness, kindness, good affection, wisdom of utterances,
    <br>good knowledge and power to counsel.
    <br>All these he are good treasures hidden in the heart.
    <br>The law of God has written, kept them there, ready for use as occasion demands -
    <br>on occasions such as you are in right now, times too difficult to deal with
    <br>times when everything around suggests no hope and no future.
    <br>Using the Word of God that you have read and taken to heart
    <br>helps to ensure that your prayer aligns with God's Word and intention for your life.
    <br>The SCOAN  Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever you need - be it direction,
    <br>whatever you need - is it breakthrough, healing, deliverance - lies in the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN  Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The Bible says that on occasions such as you are in when time is too difficult to deal with
    <br>time when everything around suggest no hope no future 
    <br>but as a Christian, using the Word of God that you have read and taken to heart
    <br>helps to ensure that your prayer aligns with God's Word and intention for your life.
    <br>Are you in need of direction?
    <br>Whatever might be your need, I want you to know that nothing good happens
    <br>without disciplining the heart.
    <br>Nothing good happens in life without disciplining your heart.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that living and praying in Jesus' name
    <br>begins by pursuing  a disciplined awareness of His nature.
    <br>The extent that we think the thoughts of Christ,
    <br>to that same extend do we have the power of Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Living and praying in Jesus' name begins by pursuing a disciplined awareness of His nature.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because the extent that we think the thoughts of Christ, to that same extent do we have the power of Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I don't know the thought that is going through your heart right now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I don't know what you are thinking right now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But I want you to know that whatever is going through your heart
    <br>will either attract Jesus to perform for you or reject Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever that is going through your heart right now
    <br>will either attract Jesus to perform for you or reject Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Don't reject Jesus".
    <br>DON'T REJECT JESUS
    <br>We oftentimes reject Jesus with the thoughts in our heart.
    <br>We cry, "Oh Lord, help me; deliver me!" but our heart says otherwise.
    <br>Our heart is not in full agreement with the words in our mouth.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to ask you a question.
    <br>When you receive any unpleasant message,
    <br>can anyone tell us, what is the first thing that is affected in your life?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You receive a message  -
    <br>and of course, it is not a pleasant message, you receive unpleasant message.
    <br>Tell us, what is the first thing that is affected in your life?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You get it, you say what?
    <br>I said, the heart.
    <br>Yes, your heart.
    <br>Your heart will be affected immediately, once the unpleasant message comes.
    <br>You begin to think doubt, worry; you will feel depressed, different thoughts come in.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you know that if care is not taken, at that particular time
    <br>satan has great advantage over you.
    <br>At the point that you receive this unpleasant message
    <br>and your heart feels worried, you feel disturbed.
    <br>In this state of mind, if care is not taken, satan has great advantage over you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At this point I will need four volunteers to quickly illustrate this message,
    <br>so that we can understand how we oftentimes reject Jesus in our hearts, and yet we cry for His mercy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We want to see how we oftentimes reject Jesus from coming to our scene
    <br>but yet we say, "Lord, help me."
    <br>We pray, we fast.
    <br>I will need four volunteers. Four people, thank you, sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I will need one of the sisters. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, we have four people here
    <br>who will be helping us to illustrate this message quickly.
    <br>And of course, we want to take these two people as our main characters here. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, sir, you help to stay here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And our brother you move a little bit back. Thank you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we want to see how we oftentimes reject Jesus
    <br>with the thoughts in our heart and yet we cry for His mercy and favour.
    <br>Remember, God is faithful.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now these two people are going to receive the same message, unpleasant message.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But they are going react differently.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This our sister here is going to act wisely, I am sorry.
    <br>And our brother here we act foolishly.
    <br>Now in this case; being a wise heart, after receiving this unpleasant message,
    <br>she will bless the name of the Lord, she will give thanks to God.
    <br>She will speak the Word of God over her situation, with all her heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Believing that God is still saying something,
    <br>even in the midst of pain. But you see -
    <br>the foolish heart
    <br>will talk about how good he has been to the poor,
    <br>how good he has been to the less privileged, to orphans
    <br>and why should God allow such problems to come his way, with the good he has done to a lot of people.
    <br>Even in the house of God, he pays so much tithes. He helps the less privileged
    <br>and why will God allow such a bad thing to happen to him.
    <br>We are going to listen to the voice of your heart.
    <br>And here comes our brother, he will act the character of satan, the tempter.
    <br>I am sorry brother, just the character.
    <br>And here comes our brother here,
    <br>he is going to act the character of the Holy Spirit, our Helper.
    <br>Now, let's quickly listen to the voice of your heart. And this the kind of way we address our issues before God.
    <br>I believe by the time you listen to this, you will understand yourself clearly.
    <br>Now, we want to listen to the heart of the wise, how he chose the bless the name of the Lord
    <br>even when everything seems hard.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus. Lord, I know you have done it. I bless You today for doing it in my life. Oh thank you, Jesus.
    <br>Even when everything around her suggests no hope, no future,
    <br>she blesses the name of the Lord from her heart.
    <br>Remember, we are listening to the voice of the heart, the thought that goes on in your heart.
    <br>And now we want to listen to the foolish heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why are you Lord upon all the good things that I am doing for You - and You are not blessing me?
    <br>Oh Lord, I am crying, with all my tithes, with all the good things that I'm doing to the less privileged -
    <br>there is no good thing on my side.
    <br>You know, these are the things that just express that we hear. But you know,
    <br>God searches the heart of man that is why he does not value our outward appearance.
    <br>What God values in man is beyond human discernment, which is planted in the heart.
    <br>You see, we have just listened to the wise heart who chose to bless the name of the Lord
    <br>even when everything around her suggest no hope, no future.
    <br>She chose to honour God and dishonour herself.
    <br>And here comes the foolish heart, who talks about how good he has been to the church,
    <br>how he gives to the poor, the lonely, the destitute and therefore why should God allow bad things to happen.
    <br>But he failed to realise that his righteousness, his good works are filthy brag in the sight of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The moment he starts complaining, murmuring, lamenting, his human nature takes over,
    <br>makes him filthy, dirty, unworthy, dumb or evil.
    <br>It is obvious that his heart has rejected Jesus from coming to the scene.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He might show on the outside: "Oh Lord, help me!" but his heart has completely shut the door from Jesus,
    <br>to come into the matter.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, here comes the tempter, you know he will always like to act fast.
    <br>And in this case, he moves quickly to see the wise heart.
    <br>And when satan goes to the wise heart, he realizes that this heart is free from condemnation.
    <br>This heart is free from guilt.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This woman's heart is free from inferiority, from murmuring, from complaining
    <br>and satan realizes that there is no co-habitation between light and darkness.
    <br>so he takes off.
    <br>Now he comes to the foolish heart, there he found his food - guilt, condemnation,  complain, murmuring,
    <br>despair and he says: "Wow, this is my food."
    <br>And he stays to add more pain, more sorrow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, here comes the character of God, the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Of course, He goes to the heart of the foolish and He realizes that this heart is completely closed
    <br>making it difficult for Jesus to come to the scene
    <br>because his heart is useless.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It's impossible for God to come to the matter.
    <br>And Jesus of course, went to the heart that welcomes redemption.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This are the perfect pictures of our life.
    <br>It is true we pray, we ask God: "Help me!"
    <br>but our heart is far from Him, making it difficult for Jesus to come onto the scene
    <br>and therefore, we reject Him on daily basis.
    <br>We reject Jesus in our heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour - don't reject Jesus.
    <br>Thank you very much all, you have blessed us this morning.
    <br>You can take the altar fruit and go back to your seat.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour: " Don't reject Jesus!"
    <br>Don't reject Jesus!
    <br>We reject Him with the thought that is going through in our heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And that will be the title of our message this morning.
    <br>Right now turn quickly with me to the Book of Hebrews.
    <br>And that will our proof text for this message.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Book of Hebrews, chapter 4. Are you there?
    <br>The Book of Hebrews, chapter 4 and I will take my reading from verse 11.
    <br>Hebrews 4:11.
    <br>"Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according
    <br>to the same extend of disobedience.
    <br>For the Word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword
    <br>piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow,
    <br>and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
    <br>And there is no creature hidden from his sight
    <br>but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him
    <br>to whom we  must give account."
    <br>Verse 14.
    <br>"Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the Heavens,
    <br>Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
    <br>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
    <br>but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.
    <br>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy
    <br>and find grace to help in time of need".
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>DON'T REJECT JESUS
    <br>We oftentimes reject Jesus when our human nature does not wholly surrender,
    <br>when we begin to experience a constant struggle, constant battle
    <br>between the spirit and the flesh, conflict between light and darkness.
    <br>We want to do it right but we find ourselves doing it wrong.
    <br>We want to act in faith but we are compelled to show unbelief.
    <br>The Bible says we live in a world where satan, the enemy of our soul
    <br>would not want the purpose of God to be revealed in our lives.
    <br>But we have to put up a fight by taking hold of our heart.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances During The Message
    <br>We live in a world where satan, the enemy of our soul will not want the purpose of God to be revealed in our lives.
    <br>But the Bible says we have to put up a fight by taking hold of our heart.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances During The Message
    <br>The Shunammite woman, in the Book of 2 Kings 4:26 realised this.
    <br>She knew that a person's life is what his thoughts make it.
    <br>What you think is what you are and what you are is what you think.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And that is why when Prophet Elisha sighted the woman from far,
    <br>he beckoned on his servant: "Run quickly and meet the Shunammite woman and ask her if everything is ok.
    <br>Your child, your husband?"
    <br>Remember this is a woman whose son just died.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Bible says, the servant ran quickly and asked the woman : "Madam, is everything ok?
    <br>Your husband, your son?"
    <br>The Bible says, in the midst of her pain, in the midst of her agony
    <br>her heart was solemnly engrossed in the Word of God
    <br>and she simply responded: "It is well."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Even when everything around her suggested no life, no hope,
    <br>her response was: "It is well".
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "It is well with my soul!
    <br>It is well with my situation!
    <br>It is well!"
    <br>Viewers all over the world, confess that word with us.
    <br>It is well with my soul, situation,
    <br>even when everything around suggests no life and no future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethen!
    <br>Living in the Word of God in times of test and trial
    <br>will assist you to respond by the Spirit of God, instead of murmuring or complaining.
    <br>Living in the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Bible says, a fearless confession comes from a Word-ruled heart.
    <br>Fearless confession comes from a Word-ruled heart,
    <br>a heart that is ruled by the Word of God - whether it feels it or not.
    <br>whether it sees it or not.
    <br>If the Word of God says it is true, then it is true.
    <br>Let the weak say, "I am strong!"
    <br>I can't hear you. Let the weak say, "I am strong!"
    <br>Viewers all over the world, let the weak say, "I am strong!"
    <br>Let the poor say, "I am blessed!" and let the oppressed say, "I am free!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can say what God has said.
    <br>If God has said it in His Word, then you can confess it, knowing that God will make it good.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have the right to say what God says, if God has said it in His Word.
    <br>The Bible says, you can confess it knowing that God will make it good.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Bible says the greatest source of human worry is about what happens next.
    <br>The greatest source of human worry is about tomorrow - what happens next.
    <br>Like many hearts are saying right now.
    <br>Are you sure, I am going to be healed?
    <br>Are you sure, when they touch me, I will be delivered?
    <br>How would it happen? Are you sure?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Bible says in the Book of Proverbs 23:7
    <br>that a heart which thinks error is sick and it is a failed heart.
    <br>A heart which doubts and worries is sick and is a failed heart.
    <br>This means worrying about our situation destroys our sense of reasoning.
    <br>The Bible says it cripples our ability to think, to talk and exercise faith in the present.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Remember, scriptural prayer releases the power of God.
    <br>When the power of God is present, healing, deliverance and salvation are like breathing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren!
    <br>In pursuit of your liberty and happiness, you need to find enough calmness
    <br>to think clearly and react diligently.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances During The Message
    <br>In pursuit of your liberty and happiness you need to think clearly and react diligently.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances During The Message
    <br>No matter the turbulent situation,
    <br>be persuaded not to listen to the panic of the moment but to find quiet voice of counsel.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances During The Message
    <br>The Bible says the Spirit of Christ in our hearts cries out naturally "Abba Father!"
    <br>This sense of fatherhood provides a natural basis for prayer.
    <br>That is why Prophet T.B. Joshua gave us a simple prayer, anointed word,
    <br>a prayer of the heart when you are faced with a situation that seems unyielding to your prayer.
    <br>You say:
    <br>"Oh Holy Spirit, take more of me and give me more of You -
    <br>more of Your gentleness, more of Your peace, more of your calmness."
    <br>Because we do not know how to pray.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit who prays within us, the groans that words can not express.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing meditate on the Word of God
    <br>and bring God's power onto the scene.
    <br>But today we only think on the Word of God and that is why we think about our trouble.
    <br>There is no way you can think on the Word of God.
    <br>Thinking on the Word of God - you only think of your trouble.
    <br>But when you meditate on the Word of God you bring God's power onto the scene.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Meditation brings revelation and revelation brings real movement.
    <br>Always ask the Holy Spirit to give you the grace to always be conscious
    <br>of your faith under tension and pressure.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren!
    <br>Always remember that when you are not happy, you are falling into satan's trap
    <br>by the state of your mind.
    <br>That is why you have to be very careful.
    <br>When you are not happy, you are falling into satan's trap
    <br>by the state of your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Don't reject Jesus!"
    <br>DON'T REJECT JESUS
    <br>Finally, brethren, turn with me to the Book of James.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Book of James 1, The Book James after the Book of Hebrews.
    <br>Lets take our reading from verse 23.
    <br>"For if anyone is hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man
    <br>observing his natural face in a mirror;
    <br>For if anyone is hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man
    <br>observing his natural face in a mirror;
    <br>for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets the kind of man he was.
    <br>But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and he is not a forgetful hearer
    <br>but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does."
    <br>Paise the Lord!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do not only be the hearer of this Word but a doer
    <br>because few things are more dangerous than a person with an unexamined heart.
    <br>Satan will not come to you physically and say, "Handover your sword."
    <br>He will come through doubt and unbelief in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>His aim is to cut off your dependence on God, your duty with God
    <br>and your communion with Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But those who are in a state of dullness, living outside the truth where their light comes from
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>saying: "How is it going to happen, are you sure I will be healed, are you sure I will be free?"
    <br>The crisis of your faith is your failure to give Christ His proper place in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your victory, your liberty starts within you, with a free heart, a balanced heart.
    <br>If you can control your heart, you can control your life.
    <br>If you can control your heart from dancing around, you can control your life.
    <br>God's promises are only recorded in the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you have taken the Word of God to heart and truly made it part of you,
    <br>it will by it's very nature change you from stagnation to success,
    <br>from sickness to good health,
    <br>from failure to prosperity.
    <br>And when it does, you will be called to act.
    <br>Don't reject Jesus.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of your heart.
    <br>I leave you with this song:
    <br>You don't have to worry 
    <br>And don't you be afraid
    <br>Joy comes in the morning 
    <br>Troubles they don't last always
    <br>There's a Friend named Jesus 
    <br>Who will wipe your tears away
    <br>And if your heart is broken 
    <br>Just lift your hands and say
    <br>I know that I can make it 
    <br>I know that I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way 
    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>With Jesus I can make it 
    <br>With Him I know I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way 
    <br>My life is in Your hands
