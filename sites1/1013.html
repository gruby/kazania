    <br>As John 5:24 says, "He who hears My Word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life,
    <br>and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life."
    <br>On Wednesday, the 21st of February 2018,
    <br>God's General, Evangelist Billy Graham, was promoted to glory at the good old age of 99.
    <br>The legacy of Evangelist Billy Graham will live on forever in the hearts of believers worldwide,
    <br>and the countless thousands who came to the knowledge of saving grace through his ministry.
    <br>As Christians, our life is a race.
    <br>As ministers, our life is a warfare.
    <br>Like Apostle Paul, his warfare was accomplished, his race was run well, he has fought a good fight.
    <br>The course is good, the victory is sure.
    <br>As we celebrate the life and legacy of God's General, Evangelist Billy Graham,
    <br>let this moment prompt your hearts to make life's biggest decision as he did:
    <br>what to do with Jesus Christ.
    <br>You need not fear where you are going when you know Jesus is going with you.
    <br>Those who are born from above, long to be there.
    <br>Heaven is our home.
    <br>"Some day you will read or hear that Billy Graham is dead. Don't believe a word of it.
    <br>I shall be more alive than I am now. I will just have changed my address.
    <br>I will have gone into the presence of God." 
    <br>- Billy Graham
