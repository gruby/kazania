  <p>    
    <br>There is a controversy over a child.
    <br>Two, forgive this man.
    <br>You should learn how to forgive, put it behind you and move forward.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Unforgivingness holding us back, blocking our future.
    <br>If you want to move, you should learn to forgive.
    <br>Forgiveness allows you to move forward.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You have not been moving forward.
    <br>It's true.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Mrs Martha Tetteh; the handsome man beside me is my husband.
    <br>We are from Ghana.
    <br>In the year 2013, on the 24th of November, we were in the prayer line.
    <br>The man of God walked up to me and he said, "There is a controversy over a child. Forgive this man."
    <br>In fact I was shocked.
    <br>I was thinking whether this prophecy was for me because I didn't know any man who had offended me
    <br>and I didn't know anything about a child.
    <br>So, I was concerned.
    <br>After the church service, I approached my husband, asking, "What do you think about this prophecy?"
    <br>He got annoyed, saying, "The prophecy is for you.
    <br>I'm waiting for you to tell me you are sorry that you had a child before you married me."
    <br>I said no and we argued over it.
    <br>We ended it there and went back to Ghana.
    <br>Two and a half years later, when my father-in-law passed away,
    <br>my husband went to a family meeting to discuss the funeral arrangements.
    <br>I was in the bedroom watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>He came in and was angry.
    <br>I asked him what had happened and why he was angry.
    <br>He said he could see the devil wanted to work through his mother and younger sister
    <br>because they had brought a boy to him telling him that he was the father.
    <br>Immediately, the Holy Spirit helped me remember the prophecy and I asked him
    <br>whether he had forgotten that two and a half years earlier we had gone to The SCOAN in Lagos
    <br>where the man of God gave me a prophecy and we argued about it.
    <br>I asked him whether he believed in the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and he said yes.
    <br>Then he exclaimed and put his hands on his head.
    <br>He was denying anything, so I asked him to calm down.
    <br>I said we had to obey what God had said, and He had said I should forgive this man.
    <br>I asked him to bring the child so I could see him, but he refused,
    <br>saying he would then have to go to the hospital for a DNA test to see whether the child was really his son.
    <br>I told him to hold on and just invite the boy so I could see him.
    <br>The next day he called the boy and immediately I saw him, I said, "Oh dear, this is your photocopy!"
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>I said there was no need for a DNA test, he should calm down because God had already spoken.
    <br>I said we should finish with the funeral and that after the funeral,
    <br>we should call together his family and the mother of the boy to sit down and sort things out.
    <br>But madam, without that prophetic message you received from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>if this situation had just happened in your home, how would you have acted?
    <br>It would not have been easy at all!
    <br>The moment he mentioned this issue, my heart was agitated and I could have slapped him there and then!
    <br>But the Spirit of God calmed me down; He said I should forgive.
    <br>As soon as I remembered the prophecy, everything calmed down.
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>My name is Ebenezer Tetteh from Ghana.
    <br>The person beside me is my lovely wife.
    <br>This day is my happiest day!
    <br>All that my wife said is true.
    <br>When I was young, I met a girl and we stayed together for a short time.
    <br>Many years ago, one day she came to me saying she was pregnant and that I was responsible.
    <br>I told her it was not me and we argued about it.
    <br>She said it was me because I had befriended her, but I continued to insist it wasn't me.
    <br>I said we should go to the hospital to take blood samples and if the doctor confirmed
    <br>that the pregnancy was from me then I would take responsibility, but she refused.
    <br>She said she knew the pregnancy was from me so she didn't need to go to any hospital.
    <br>I took that as confirmation that I was not the one who made her pregnant.
    <br>Then the lady started crying and we separated.
    <br>It was about 20 years ago.
    <br>After that, I met my lovely wife and we married about 19 years ago.
    <br>Our 19th wedding anniversary is this month.
    <br>As my wife said, the prophecy came and two and a half years later, my father passed away.
    <br>During the planning of the funeral, my mother came to me with a young man and said, "This boy is your son."
    <br>I became angry and suggested we wait until after the funeral to sort everything out.
    <br>Later, my mother brought the boy to me again telling me that he was my son and that I needed to accept him.
    <br>My heart started beating - just imagine having to explain to my wife that I had a child somewhere
    <br>and then the child appeared telling everyone he was my son.
    <br>How would I approach my wife? I was anxious.
    <br>The truth is that I didn't know I had a son somewhere.
    <br>My wife quietly asked me whether I believed Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I said I did and she reminded me of how she had been to Lagos some years back
    <br>and she had received a prophecy that there was a child controversy and she should forgive this man.
    <br>So she said that if today someone was telling me he was my son, I should remember that prophecy
    <br>and accept this issue, and that I should invite the boy for her to see him.
    <br>I agreed and did that.
    <br>As soon as my wife saw the boy, she said he must be from me.
    <br>Let's put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>Again, I said we should go with the boy and the mother to the hospital for a blood test to confirm
    <br>before I should accept this boy to our family.
    <br>My wife disagreed and told me I should accept this prophecy.
    <br>She said that God could never lie to us.
    <br>After my wife advised me, I calmed down and we went to the boy's family to sit down and discuss.
    <br>So, this boy came into my family.
    <br>As I am talking to you now, the boy is here with me.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together.
    <br>Before I knew this boy, the mother named him Felix, but after the prophecy when we went to take my son,
    <br>I named him Perez Tetteh.
    <br>OK, Perez Tetteh, can you come forward?
    <br>Let's put our hands together.
    <br>Indeed the prophetic message... you can see a carbon copy!
    <br>IS HE MY SON?!? | PROPHECY Reveals Shocking Truth...
    <br>This is father and son; put your hands together wonderfully one more time.
    <br>My name is Perez Tetteh from Ghana.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my father and the woman nearby is my step-mother,
    <br>but now the mother I am living with.
    <br>Since I was born, I was with my mother.
    <br>I kept asking where my father was.
    <br>Whenever I asked this, she became angry; she did not want to tell me the whole story.
    <br>I kept on asking and she told me I had a father but she couldn't show me where he was.
    <br>She explained that the father had denied the pregnancy, so he would not be coming for me.
    <br>But I said I wanted to go to my daddy, because everybody has a father.
    <br>I said that all my friends had fathers and that I was struggling just living with her.
    <br>I had to go out to work sometimes even to be able to eat.
    <br>Meanwhile I must have a father somewhere, so I wanted to go to him.
    <br>She said no.
    <br>One day, I received a call and it was an old lady's voice.
    <br>I asked who it was and she said she was my grandmother and I was her grandchild.
    <br>I said I didn't know her, but she responded that she wanted to show me where my father was.
    <br>I didn't believe her.
    <br>She said my grandfather had passed away and I protested that I didn't even know her,
    <br>so how could I know my grandfather?
    <br>She asked me to come to the funeral so that all the family would see me, because I resembled my father.
    <br>The woman had seen me some years ago, in 2010, and thought that I looked like her son
    <br>and that I must be her grandchild.
    <br>That was back then, before my grandfather passed away in 2015.
    <br>So, she told me to come to the funeral.
    <br>At first I didn't believe it but she kept calling me so I agreed to go.
    <br>When I arrived there, one of my aunties showed me a picture of this man on her phone.
    <br>I was sitting quietly when suddenly this man arrived and after seeing his picture and now seeing him in person,
    <br>I said that this was the man.
    <br>I left everything to my grandmother.
    <br>After a few minutes, I went to her and complained that the man had come but hadn't said anything to me.
    <br>Since she was the one saying he was my father, she agreed to go to talk to him.
    <br>30 minutes later she came and said that my father wanted to see my mother,
    <br>before he could consider accepting me.
    <br>I said I also wanted to see him.
    <br>So I called my mum to come since the man wanted to see her.
    <br>At first she didn't want to but I persuaded her because if she didn't come I would go to him on my own.
    <br>So, eventually both families reconciled?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And right now, you are back with your father?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How has life been after that incident?
    <br>Now I am OK, everything is normal for me.
    <br>Before, if I had nothing to eat, like I said, I would go and work for someone.
    <br>I even learned how to drive, in order to get money to eat.
    <br>Meanwhile, my father had a lot of cars at his house.
    <br>So after coming to my father, I now have everything at home.
    <br>IS HE MY SON?!? | PROPHECY Reveals Shocking Truth...
    <br>Since I was young, I never thought I would ever enter a plane.
    <br>But when I came to my father, he travelled to South Korea this year from May to June
    <br>and through my father, I had the experience of entering a plane.
    <br>Put your hands together wonderfully!
    <br>God is good and He loves me so much.
    <br>Before this prophecy...
    <br>My son said that his father had cars; during that time I had about 5 cars as part of my Spare Parts business.
    <br>But after this prophecy came to our family and I received my son... God is good!
    <br>Before the prophecy I was renting an apartment in Accra but now I am building my house -
    <br>a very nice house - and I have about 20 cars.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ?
    <br>Recently, I went to the Embassy for my visa and they gave me a five-year multiple visa to South Korea.
    <br>Before this young man came to my life, I would struggle to get my visa for South Korea.
    <br>So, through this prophecy of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, I am blessed.
    <br>I am here to thank God for what He has done in my life through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I used to go to the hospital with sicknesses such as stomach ulcer; there were so many problems,
    <br>but by God's grace, after the prophecy and this young man came to my home,
    <br>I am well and there is no sickness.
    <br>My advice to the whole world: I am here to advise any young man that might have a case similar to my own,
    <br>please wake up and go to that lady to apologise and to bring your child home,
    <br>and you will be blessed as God has blessed me.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together wonderfully.
    <br>My advice to the men: If you are here or you are watching me, start thinking, remember your past.
    <br>If you have the same case as ours, do something about it.
    <br>And also to the women: Please, if something happens like this, believe in God and hold on.
    <br>Give everything to God.
    <br>Don't worry about your property.
    <br>It can happen like that; maybe you think that person has come to take over your property.
    <br>No; there are more properties in Heaven.
    <br>IS HE MY SON?!? | PROPHECY Reveals Shocking Truth...
    <br>To God be the glory. We thank God for what the Lord has done in your life and in your family, sir.
    <br>We want to encourage you to continue to make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>Remember, God Almighty has spoken, so our duty is to follow His leading daily.
    <br>Continue to follow Him.
    <br>For those whose lives are centred in Christ Jesus, the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Amen!
