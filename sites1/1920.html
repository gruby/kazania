    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There is a woman under the gallery, in that section.
    <br>There is something inside you; it is not a fibroid but is has burst.
    <br>It is coming out in the form of bleeding.
    <br>It is not something you can keep to yourself.
    <br>TB JOSHUA SAW SOMETHING BURST!!!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Begin to check yourself.
    <br>The lady whom the prophecy concerns comes forward, in confirmation of the prophecy.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>As I am standing here, I am bleeding; something just burst out of my body.
    <br>For further confirmation of the prophetic message given to her by Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>she goes to the restroom to check herself.
    <br>And what do we see?
    <br>The evidence of what God has done.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>After the word of prophecy given by Prophet T.B. Joshua to Mrs Happiness,
    <br>a few months later she came back to The SCOAN with her husband
    <br>to testify to the glory of God.
    <br>Let's listen to them.
    <br>My name is Mrs Happiness Chinweoke.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was blocked tubes and I was looking for the fruit of the womb.
    <br>I was not able to get pregnant.
    <br>We went from one hospital to another and they told me that it was an infection
    <br>and that both tubes were blocked - there was no way I could get pregnant.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>After the prophecy, my tubes were cleared.
    <br>I was able to meet my husband, as husband as wife.
    <br>After that, I received the result saying that I am pregnant.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I am now an expectant mother.
    <br>Very soon I will have my baby.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Shall we put our hand together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Mrs Happiness Chinweoke.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband.
    <br>And the baby is mine.
    <br>His name is Jesse Chinweoke.
    <br>Last year, I received a prophecy from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>During mass prayer, he mentioned that there was a woman under the gallery,
    <br>that something burst out of her.
    <br>I came out to confirm the prophecy.
    <br>Before that prophecy, I was in the church.
    <br>I was having stomach problems; my stomach was turning seriously.
    <br>I went out to the restroom to check myself
    <br>and I found out that something was coming out of me.
    <br>I saw it - it was blood.
    <br>I was asking myself, I didn't have any history of fibroids,
    <br>nobody told me I had fibroids.
    <br>Before this prophecy, I was having tubal blockage, which led to barrenness for about 2 years
    <br>and I couldn't conceive.
    <br>I have been going from one hospital to the other with my husband.
    <br>They checked me, they said both my tubes were blocked.
    <br>There was no way I could be able to conceive.
    <br>I kept on praying to God that I was too young to be barren.
    <br>I was so keen to have my baby because I married at an early age.
    <br>So that was the problem you came with that day?
    <br>That was the problem that brought me here to The SCOAN.
    <br>I was crying that day.
    <br>People maybe were thinking that I was in the spirit,
    <br>but I cried because of my condition.
    <br>So I cried that day.
    <br>And I know that God saw my heart and He used the man of God to call out my case.
    <br>So I came out to confirm it.
    <br>After that prophecy, I went home and I met my husband as husband and wife and became pregnant.
    <br>I called my doctor and told him that I was pregnant.
    <br>He was surprised, and he asked how it had happened.
    <br>He said that I should come to the hospital and let him check me.
    <br>He did some scans of me.
    <br>He didn't even say "Congratulations".
    <br>After checking it, he said 'Wow'.
    <br>Then he congratulated me.
    <br>I came back here again with my pregnancy to thank God again.
    <br>I was here to thank God.
    <br>And I went back home; I gave birth.
    <br>I brought my child here to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua for what He has done for me.
    <br>I gave birth to a baby boy.
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus
    <br>for this wonderful miracle in the life of this family.
    <br>I am here to thank God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>He gave us a safe delivery.
    <br>And I wanted to add one thing:
    <br>When I gave birth to this baby, the doctor called him a 'precious baby'
    <br>because it was like a mystery to him.
    <br>I am here to thank God for what He has done in my life
    <br>and also thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for allowing himself to be used by God to deliver me.
    <br>And what is the name of your bouncing baby?
    <br>The name of my baby is Master Jesse Chinweoke.
    <br>The name was given to me by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>My name is Paul Chinweoke.
    <br>The lady beside me is my wife.
    <br>The baby in my hands is my son, Jesse Chinweoke.
    <br>I am here today to thank God for what God has done for my family and in my life.
    <br>She has said it all.
    <br>Your wife has said it all.
    <br>My advice to the people listening to me is whatever you are passing through,
    <br>have faith and believe in God.
    <br>There is nothing God cannot do; He can do all things.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony.
    <br>My advice:
    <br>I know there are many people here who have the same challenges, or even worse;
    <br>once you are here, trust God.
    <br>God that did it for me must surely do it for you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony.
    <br>Thank you very much for that wonderful advice
    <br>that we should indeed trust in God Almighty.
    <br>And we also want to advise you that you make sure you train this child in the way of the Lord,
    <br>so that when he grows up, he would not depart from the Lord, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We believe God Almighty will give you that grace to do that,
    <br>and that you continue to serve Him and be close to Him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
