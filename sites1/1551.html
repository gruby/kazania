  <p>    
    <br>Three times the pregnancy came down.
    <br>Yes, sir; you are very right, sir.
    <br>The first time was a girl, the second was a girl and the third was a boy.
    <br>You are very correct, sir.
    <br>This child keeps appearing to you in the dream.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>In fact, you bought a female baby dress.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Yes! You are very correct, sir.
    <br>Why did you buy a female baby dress and put it inside the bag?
    <br>We were actually expecting the baby to come but the baby didn't come.
    <br>Each time, she had a mysterious miscarriage.
    <br>She is going to have a baby boy.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prophecy and Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Months later, the couple came back to The SCOAN
    <br>and received another prophetic message from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Let's watch.
    <br>Brother!
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>My brother, somebody slapped you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>It happened in the physical before it happened in the dream.
    <br>Yes, sir. You are very correct, sir.
    <br>If somebody tells you, "You will see," and that night you see them trying to kill you,
    <br>the person who said, "You will see!" in the daylight, he meant it.
    <br>You are very correct, sir. Yes, sir.
    <br>Yes, sir. You are correct.
    <br>I had an issue with somebody in the day.
    <br>That night, I had more than 1,000 slaps in my ears.
    <br>Do you know that after those slaps, your orientation, your thinking changed?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You are not industrial anymore.
    <br>You cannot reason well.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I told them; they didn't believe me. I said it. When it happened, I knew it.
    <br>The reason I called you is because your destiny has been tempered with.
    <br>I want to pray with you so that you can be released.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>You have been released!
    <br>Don't worry. That is over.
    <br>It was an ogbanje (agent of satan) that attacked you.
    <br>The woman ogbanje (agent of satan) in the physical attacked you in the dream.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>What you believe is your problem is not what I am talking about.
    <br>Your affection is dead. You cannot meet your wife.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>You cannot satisfy your wife.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I've been waiting for this day.
    <br>Don't worry. Nothing will happen to this marriage.
    <br>He will satisfy you. He is your husband.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>I am Mrs Armstrong Ekoma.
    <br>The person standing close to me is my lovely husband, Mr Armstong Ekoma
    <br>and the next by his left is my elder sister, Mrs Loreta Omibi
    <br>and the next person is Mr Bright, a friend to the family.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Children of God, you have watched this lovely clip,
    <br>you saw what God has done in our lives.
    <br>We came here to seek the face of the Lord because of the problem of constant miscarriages.
    <br>Children of God, I went to several hospitals
    <br>and I went to ask what the problem was because I was having miscarriages.
    <br>When we did all that and we didn't see headway,
    <br>we came here to seek the face of God.
    <br>Children of God, there is God in this place!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>That very day we came here, we were opportune to be called out
    <br>as you watched by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And he beckoned on my husband as you saw, and he said, "Where is your daughter?"
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My husband said he had no daughter.
    <br>He then said, "You have been having several miscarriages."
    <br>My husband said it was true.
    <br>He now looked at me and asked me a question,
    <br>why is it that I put baby things in the box.
    <br>Now my husband answered - it was because
    <br>anytime we were expecting a baby, I always had mysterious miscarriages.
    <br>The man of God now said, "She is going to have a baby boy."
    <br>Today is a wonderful day in our lives.
    <br>That is why I have come here, children of God, to celebrate this good God.
    <br>You can see my bundle of testimony that God has given to me.
    <br>This is the baby boy that the man of God prophesied about -
    <br>that it was going to come to pass.
    <br>Children of God, praise the Lord!
    <br>She is going to have a baby boy.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prophecy & Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>After several miscarriages we came down here and the touch of God through the man of God
    <br>upon our lives changed everything.
    <br>When we got back home, we met as husband and wife,
    <br>and my brothers and sisters, this is the testimony.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Children of God, you need to experience it, before you can understand what I mean.
    <br>It was a sad thing.
    <br>But because I believed God, we waited.
    <br>We waited on God because He said tarry and again, do not tarry.
    <br>And indeed, we waited patiently.
    <br>I always use one word that the man of God said since he gave this prophecy.
    <br>He said, "A prophet will say that which will come to pass."
    <br>And indeed, we waited and it really came to pass.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I knew that God was going to locate us that day.
    <br>I am so happy because I had a dream about it before it came to pass.
    <br>Because of that, our lives have turned around.
    <br>And today you are carrying...
    <br>...my bundle of miracle, my baby boy.
    <br>Baby boy - by the name?
    <br>Divine.
    <br>Divine. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 23:1)
    <br>My name is Armstrong Ekoma.
    <br>I am a legal practicioner.
    <br>I practice law in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria.
    <br>Brothers and sisters, like you have watched, it was a terrible experience for me.
    <br>Let me start when the man of God said,
    <br>this marriage is not going to break.
    <br>It was true because there was actually an attempt by the enemy to break my marriage
    <br>because of this issue of miscarriages.
    <br>And that started with something that I can't explain.
    <br>In fact, it started with the fact that one day my wife's wedding ring disappeared
    <br>and two weeks later, my own disappeared.
    <br>We said, what is all this.
    <br>And that was a few years after we got married
    <br>and before we knew it, we didn't see our wedding rings again.
    <br>Eight months later, the system I used to work in my house had issues,
    <br>and I called the system engineer, computer engineer to come and fix it.
    <br>He took the computer to his office, opened it and called me I should come.
    <br>I said, "What is it?" He said, "Come and see."
    <br>I got to his office, he had already opened the system
    <br>and I saw my wedding ring inside the belly of that computer.
    <br>That is to tell you the genesis of the attack.
    <br>When the man of God said, "You cannot satisfy your wife" - it is true.
    <br>I confirm that to be very true.
    <br>It was not because I was not ready to do anything or I was not prepared -
    <br>it was because of what I was going through.
    <br>All of a sudden I started having a serious attack, pain -
    <br>such pain that if I imagined anything about sex, that would be trouble.
    <br>I didn't even think about it.
    <br>I got erection quite alright but I would not dare think of sex, because if I tried it, the kind of pain I would be in -
    <br>the next two weeks I would be feeling pains all over my waist, my groin, spinal cord,
    <br>I was having pain everywhere.
    <br>I didn't know what to do, so I went to the hospital.
    <br>The hospital did all manner of investigations,
    <br>they couldn't find anything and they sent me for an MRI investigation.
    <br>I was sent to Abuja.
    <br>I went to the MRI machine, and the report came out.
    <br>I was told I have a degenerating disc disease.
    <br>I have the report of the MRI machine here.
    <br>I then took the report back to my doctor and I said this was what they said.
    <br>He looked at it and said, "No, they have to conduct another one to be sure."
    <br>At Jos University Teaching Hospital, I had to conduct another MRI investigation.
    <br>They conducted that and the report also came out.
    <br>They said I have to undergo an operation - spinal cord operation at the lower level.
    <br>I said, I would not.
    <br>The specialist told me that I should choose - my chances were 50/50:
    <br>if I took that operation, chances were that I would be on the wheelchair for the rest of my life
    <br>or if I didn't want it... I told him I would not do this operation.
    <br>That was what brought us here for the second time.
    <br>When I came here, luckily enough, the man of God located me and as he was just coming down,
    <br>I was the first person, he said, "This is urgent, there is an emergency," and he called me.
    <br>I was seated down here, he said I should come out
    <br>and I came out and he spoke to me.
    <br>I confirm all what he said to be true.
    <br>After praying with us, in few hours I started having another pain between my legs.
    <br>Now between the anus and my testis, I had a boil there, it started growing -
    <br>right here in this arena.
    <br>I told my wife, "What is going on?
    <br>I came here with waist pain, now another one has joined. Why?"
    <br>I didn't know that that was where the miracle lay.
    <br>And so the thing started growing.
    <br>On Tuesday we left from here
    <br>because I was becoming too uncomfortable and so I left.
    <br>I couldn't walk. I couldn't sit down. I had to charter a vehicle from here to Jos
    <br>and I had to lie down all the way through until we got back home.
    <br>Three days after we got back home, that thing had developed to a very big ball until it burst.
    <br>The thing burst open, and a lot of pus came out
    <br>and after that pus came out, there was no problem any longer.
    <br>I didn't go for the operation again and that was how I got healed.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Once again, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>When we went back home, we were believing God that the man of God had spoken
    <br>and he said, "A prophet will live to see that which he has prophesied come to pass."
    <br>So we were waiting to see that which he had talked about
    <br>because at the end of the day, this pain started so I had to come back.
    <br>So it was after the deliverance, the second time and all those things that were disturbing me
    <br>went out through that pus - that was when I received this baby.
    <br>And that was how this miracle came to pass.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>There is no challenge. I'm fit, I'm proper now.
    <br>Very fit and proper and throughout the period of the pregnancy, my wife never had any problem at all.
    <br>It just came seamlessly and we just give God the glory for what He has done in our lives.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>This was the period when my wife was pregnant.
    <br>This was the early stage.
    <br>Because after a very long time - in fact, we suffered this for 10 years.
    <br>We were married for 10 years and this was when she eventually got this pregnancy.
    <br>Before now, we had lost 6 pregnancies.
    <br>So after that we decided to take these pictures for people to actually know
    <br>that God has done something in our lives.
    <br>This was another stage and this was the final stage of the pregnancy.
    <br>And then, when she delivered in the hospital - this was the baby.
    <br>This is my wife and the baby in the hospital when she delivered.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I give thanks to God and I want to thank the man of God for what he has done in our lives.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I confirm the second part of this prophecy to be very correct because I had an issue with somebody
    <br>and then we had a heated argument. That night was terrible for me.
    <br>It was just coming left, right and centre - I was just seeing slaps.
    <br>They were just giving me slaps anyhow.
    <br>In fact, I can tell you, it was over a 1000 times.
    <br>What eventually came out of me was the confirmation of the attack that I had from somebody.
    <br>The man of God just got it right. He hit the nail on the head.
    <br>Through the power of the Holy Spirit, he saw it all.
    <br>He got it and I was healed when eventually I got out of that mess
    <br>from the thing that happened to me thereafter.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I can confirm to you again now.
    <br>What you can see - whether I have affection or whether I can perform now - is what you have seen here.
    <br>This is the evidence.
    <br>That is the evidence, the results. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>I advise all persons who are here and those who are watching me outside of this arena -
    <br>it pays to endure.
    <br>It pays to believe in the Prophet.
    <br>I don't even know why my parents did not name me Thomas. I doubt a lot.
    <br>You must prove everything beyond reasonable doubt
    <br>and so for me to believe anything, you must show beyond doubt that there is no doubt
    <br>in what you are telling me, for me to believe.
    <br>And so at the end of the day, things that have happened to me - I have now come to believe,
    <br>it is stupid for anybody to begin to doubt or for me to begin to doubt.
    <br>And for those who are still in doubt whether there is God here
    <br>or whether the man of God is truly a man of God -
    <br>you better have to re-think.
    <br>Because as far as I am concerned, if he is not a true man of God,
    <br>then it means the devil will see God.
    <br>Give glory to God Almighty, let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My words of advice, especially to women all over the world - never give up on your hope.
    <br>They should stay focused and be patient
    <br>and wait patiently for God's time
    <br>because in His own time, He makes all things beautiful.
