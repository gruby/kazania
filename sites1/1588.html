  <p>    
    <br>Turn to your neighbour, and greet them, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel".
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>Now, whilst you are still standing, I want you to ask a very simple question to your neighbour.
    <br>Just turn to your neighbour and say, "Neighbour!
    <br>Are you prepared for what you are praying for?"
    <br>Turn to the other neighbour, ask them the same question, "Neighbour!
    <br>Are you prepared for what you are praying for?"
    <br>Now, turn to the viewers, face the viewers, say,
    <br>"Viewers, are you prepared for what you are praying for?"
    <br>Do you know the reason I'm asking you this question?
    <br>Because I want to assure you today that your prayers and tears of many years are not lost.
    <br>I mean your case has been set aside for the special attention of Jesus.
    <br>I mean you have been positioned to accomplish your destiny.
    <br>Breakthrough is your portion!
    <br>Abundance is your portion!
    <br>Fruitfulness is your portion!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>And the people of God say...
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>We were all very exited, eager and quick to shout "Amen!" to these declarations.
    <br>But there is something I want you to take note of.
    <br>Yes, indeed the blessings are ready for you but are you ready for them?
    <br>Think about this question very well.
    <br>I will repeat it once again.
    <br>The blessings are ready for you; they are on the table.
    <br>The question is: "Are you ready for them?"
    <br>I know some of you would be looking at me and saying, "Well, of course I'm ready.
    <br>Brother Chris, what kind of question is this?
    <br>I traveled all the way from my country.
    <br>Do you know how much my flight ticket was to be here?
    <br>Because I'm ready for these blessings.
    <br>Do you know how many years I have suffered in my family?
    <br>Curses of limitation and backwardness.
    <br>Do you know how many places and churches I have gone to, from left, right and center?
    <br>Yes, of course I'm ready for the blessings.
    <br>That's why I'm here."
    <br>But the reason I am asking this question
    <br>is that it is very common today for people to seek God
    <br>for things they are not yet mature enough to manage.
    <br>Let me repeat that.
    <br>It is very common today for people to come to church to seek the face of God
    <br>for something they are not yet spiritually mature enough to manage.
    <br>They are asking God for something their spiritual life is not yet strong enough to accommodate.
    <br>The blessing is released but it may not be received
    <br>because God is not going to give you something you are not yet mature enough
    <br>to manage and maintain.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Turn to your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, check yourself".
    <br>Turn to your other neighbour, say, "Neighbour, check yourself".
    <br>The blessings are ready for you; they are waiting for you.
    <br>You listened to the testimonies.
    <br>Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Living Water, is present in our midst to meet you
    <br>at the point of your needs but are you ready for them?
    <br>Sometimes it may seem as if our prayers are not answered
    <br>or the results of our prayers are delayed in coming
    <br>because God is busy preparing you for what you are praying for.
    <br>Never forget that God is not as interested in our present comfort as He is in our eternal glory.
    <br>Take note, I'm not saying that God is not interested in your present comfort - no!
    <br>The promise of God is for you to prosper.
    <br>The plan of God is for you to enjoy the abundance, the fulfillment of His promises,
    <br>to enjoy the full rights and privileges of being a child of the Most High God
    <br>but He is more concerned about your eternal state than your present comfort.
    <br>I will ask the question again.
    <br>Do you want to prosper?
    <br>I want to hear you very loudly - do you want to prosper?
    <br>You want to prosper in your finances?
    <br>You want to prosper in your marriage?
    <br>You want to prosper in your family?
    <br>You want to prosper in your business?
    <br>Then let me give you this simple secret.
    <br>Get this revelation planted in your heart:
    <br>The first place you must prosper is your spiritual life
    <br>because your spiritual life is the engine that carries your success.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour, say, "Neighbour.
    <br>The first place you must prosper is your spiritual life
    <br>because your spiritual life is the engine that carries your success.
    <br>I hope you understand, people of God.
    <br>I want to be very clear.
    <br>When I say, "Do you want to prosper?", I'm not talking about prosperity as defined by society,
    <br>or by the world; just by material things.
    <br>I am talking about prosperity with peace of heart, prosperity with internal joy,
    <br>prosperity with the assurance of life, the security of God's presence.
    <br>As Joshua says, "Not just success but good success".
    <br>This is available for you when you are ready to prosper first in your spiritual life.
    <br>This is how to pray and receive answers.
    <br>The secret is simple.
    <br>Look after your relationship with God and let God look after the results of your prayers.
    <br>Look after your relationship with God and He will look after the results.
    <br>This will bring us to the title of today's message:
    <br>RELATIONSHIP BEFORE RESULTS
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>Seek your relationship with God first before results."
    <br>People of God, Christianity is a relationship.
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not just the work we do,
    <br>is not the church services we attend or the amount of prayers we pray or the songs we sing
    <br>or the miracles we receive, the healing, blessing, deliverance we receive.
    <br>This is all wonderful but that's not the main thing about Christianity.
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is our relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Nothing is more important than our relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Quickly turn with me to Ephesians chapter 2, which will be the proof text for today's message.
    <br>Ephesians 2:19.
    <br>And Apostle Paul says,
    <br>"Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens
    <br>with God's people and also members of his household,
    <br>built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
    <br>with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone."
    <br>I repeat once again.
    <br>"...with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone.
    <br>In Him the whole building is joined together..."
    <br>In Him we live, in Him we move, in Him we have our being.
    <br>He is the main thing about Christianity.
    <br>"In Him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord."
    <br>What I'm emphasizing here is very simple.
    <br>Nothing is more important than our relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Your relationship with Jesus is more important than what you are praying for today.
    <br>Is it healing, deliverance, breakthrough, peace in your family, your marriage,
    <br>fruitfulness in the place of barrenness?
    <br>Yes! That's important.
    <br>Yes! They are available.
    <br>What is more important is your relationship with Jesus.
    <br>This is the thing God asks us to look after.
    <br>And it is the only thing that is being continually attacked - our relationship with God.
    <br>Satan will be moving around; the Bible describes him like a lion moving around,
    <br>seeking whom he may devour, trying to disconnect your relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Even as you are sitting in the church today...
    <br>You are here, in the house of God.
    <br>So far as you took that step to be here in the house of God, satan will try to distract your mind,
    <br>put something in your heart to not listen to the message,
    <br>to be distracted, overwhelmed, "Why did they treat like me this when I was outside?
    <br>What is the meaning of this? Do you know how many hours I've traveled to be here?"
    <br>You are meditating on this, as the Word of God is being preached.
    <br>How do you expect to receive what God has promised you?
    <br>Satan is fighting your relationship with God.
    <br>This is the irony: For many of us, the very thing we are praying for God to give us
    <br>is the same thing satan will use to attack our relationship with God.
    <br>Can you see the reason why God must prepare you for what you are praying for?
    <br>I will repeat that again.
    <br>Many of us, what we are here praying for today, asking God to release into our lives
    <br>is the same thing satan will use to attack our relationship with God.
    <br>Let me try to be practical.
    <br>Many of us are here seeking the face of God for one need or the other;
    <br>be it physical, emotional, marital, mental, spiritual - just name it.
    <br>We are here in the church, seeking the face of God but by the time our needs are met,
    <br>we may likely forget the Source of our blessing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>By the time our problems are solved, we may be quick to forget the Source of our blessing.
    <br>Why? Because we became so busy with the blessing that we forget the Giver.
    <br>We become so overexcited at the results that we forget the relationship with God.
    <br>God knows this.
    <br>God knows that success has many dangers of its own.
    <br>All high places are slippery places.
    <br>God knows that by the time we get to the top,
    <br>it is common for our spiritual life to gradually begin to deteriorate.
    <br>Why? Because pleasure takes our hearts, our loyalty away from God
    <br>and we become lukewarm in our Christian walk.
    <br>Compromise, complacency...
    <br>This is the reason why God will take His time in considering your request
    <br>because He is busy preparing you for what you are praying for.
    <br>He is more concerned about your relationship with Him than the results of those prayers.
    <br>Let me be very practical here; I will come out to the front.
    <br>Let me give you an example of what many of us will be doing.
    <br>We are here in the church today asking God for something.
    <br>Let's just use this fruit as an example.
    <br>We are asking God to give us all of these fruits,
    <br>because that's human beings - we want more.
    <br>Even if we receive more, we want more.
    <br>We are like Oliver Twist, "Please, sir, can I have some more?" - that is our life.
    <br>We are asking God, "God, give me these fruits".
    <br>I don't know what they may represent in your own life;
    <br>it could be a healing, breakthrough, promotion.
    <br>We are asking God, "Please, God, give this to me".
    <br>Do you know what God is going to do?
    <br>You are looking for all these fruits.
    <br>God will first of all give you one apple and see how you manage it.
    <br>You are asking for all of these
    <br>but God wants to see your attitude, your response, your reaction when He just gives you one
    <br>because many times, just little blessing that comes our way...
    <br>And you that were the first person in church, were so fervent in your Christian life;
    <br>just one blessing that comes your way...
    <br>Before you know it, you become too busy for God.
    <br>You no longer give your quality time to God.
    <br>Even if you come to the church, you arrive late and you leave early.
    <br>As the minister of God is preaching, many people are quickly checking their watch,
    <br>"You should be fast. I have this meeting."
    <br>As the sermon is going on, your phone rings; one phone here, another phone here.
    <br>By the time you know it, you have four phones.
    <br>Can you answer four people at the same time?
    <br>Just one blessing...
    <br>When you come to the church, you expect the minister of God to plan his program
    <br>to suit your own personal time table.
    <br>You, that before were the first person here, joining the work of God,
    <br>helping the ushers - before you know it, you become too busy.
    <br>Pride steps in.
    <br>Pleasure is often accompanied by pride.
    <br>And the very thing that God gave you has become the very thing that is taking you away from Him.
    <br>How do you expect God to give you the rest?
    <br>Do you know what happens to so many of us - just the one we receive, by the time it's...
    <br>It takes us away from God.
    <br>Suddenly something happens.
    <br>The blessing scatters.
    <br>Blessing is scattered.
    <br>The little that you had is gone.
    <br>Thank you, brother.
    <br>See, it is scattered, gone, even broken.
    <br>See, look, the blessing is scattered, everything is broken.
    <br>At that moment you begin to say, "Let me come back to God".
    <br>You run back.
    <br>The blessing is broken, scattered, you are back to square one.
    <br>You have not maintained what you have received, you have not managed it.
    <br>You come back, "God, please, give me this fruit".
    <br>How will God give you something that will at the end of the day become a source of temptation to your life?
    <br>Do you not realize that God is the Owner of all these fruits?
    <br>He can give you everything - this and this...
    <br>He can give you everything more than your heart could dream or desire
    <br>but He is more concerned about your relationship with Him,
    <br>so by the time the blessing comes, it will not take you away from Him.
    <br>Let me give you another practical example.
    <br>Do you know that today...
    <br>Many people, when little blessing comes their way, they change their environment,
    <br>they change the people they are moving with
    <br>because the blessing that you are seeking from God is accompanied by new responsibilities,
    <br>new connections and new temptations.
    <br>And these things are capable of robbing you of the joy of that position
    <br>unless your spiritual life is secure.
    <br>When blessing comes our way; a bit of breakthrough, the business starts booming,
    <br>we move environments, we change the people we are moving with.
    <br>Before you were living in a poor area - you move to the rich area.
    <br>Before you didn't use to socialize in these kind of gatherings and parties -
    <br>before you know it, your address book is filled with different appointments,
    <br>going to places where they are celebrating worldly concerns.
    <br>Worldly commitments, the lures and cares of the world quickly occupy our hearts
    <br>and our spiritual life begins to deteriorate.
    <br>Just think about this:
    <br>If you are poor and God blesses you, and you now move to the rich area,
    <br>who is going to help the poor people, when the Bible says that you are blessed to bless others?
    <br>Today, if you look at society, the rich are getting richer
    <br>and it seems that the poor are getting poorer.
    <br>Let me use Prophet T.B. Joshua as a very wonderful example in this regard.
    <br>All of us here are witness to this:
    <br>For the thirty years that we have been witnessing this ministry, The SCOAN -
    <br>this ministry has been located here, in this environment of Ikotun Egbe.
    <br>Thirty years!
    <br>Do you not think that the man of God didn't have the money or the resources
    <br>to move the ministry to a richer or a more affluent or a better environment?
    <br>No! He had every resources.
    <br>From human point of view, this is not the ideal location for a mega church.
    <br>From the human point of view, this is a difficult place to get.
    <br>There are many challenges, obstacles, things that would be easier in another environment.
    <br>But Prophet T.B. Joshua listens to the voice of God, not the direction of blessing.
    <br>If you listen to what the blessing is telling you, the blessing will say,
    <br>"Why didn't you go to the rich area? You will be able to attract more people.
    <br>It will be easier for people of a certain class and caliber to attend."
    <br>But God said, "Stay here in Ikotun Egbe".
    <br>You are a witness to this;
    <br>apart from the spiritual blessings that are poured out week in and week out,
    <br>people are coming from all over the world,
    <br>do you know that this entire area, the entire surrounding environment here,
    <br>thousands of people - their livelihood depends on this ministry.
    <br>As we are talking right now, they are doing business outside.
    <br>The hotels, restaurants, markets are full.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because Prophet T.B. Joshua understands, we are blessed to bless others.
    <br>But today, little blessing comes our way - we move, we forget where we are coming from, we leave.
    <br>People of God, I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.
    <br>You know, I said something at the very beginning.
    <br>The first place you are to prosper is your spiritual life
    <br>because your spiritual life, your relationship with God is the engine that carries your success.
    <br>Take that image and try to "practicalise" it.
    <br>Take that scenario and think about it practically.
    <br>If you prosper financially, without prospering spiritually,
    <br>it is like owning a beautiful car with no engine.
    <br>It may look beautiful, neat - you may show it off to people, but it is worthless,
    <br>because it cannot go anywhere.
    <br>Its real value is lost!
    <br>Its true purpose is missing!
    <br>It has just become a fashion parade.
    <br>This is the case of someone who prospers financially without prospering spiritually.
    <br>You may see them with money; they have money, yet unanswered questions in their life.
    <br>They have riches but they are still complaining of what they do not have.
    <br>In their privates, when the lights are switched off and no one is looking,
    <br>they cry for what they do not have,
    <br>and parade their car with no engine.
    <br>What am I saying, brethren?
    <br>How will I conclude this message?
    <br>Turn with me in your Bibles, as I bring this message to a conclusion.
    <br>Turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of Matthew 16:26.
    <br>And the Bible says this:
    <br>"What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?
    <br>Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"
    <br>People of God,
    <br>don't get your hands dirty for the sake of something that cannot guarantee eternity.
    <br>Don't get your heart dirty for the sake of someone who does not hold your destiny.
    <br>If your hands are full of money, if your head is full of information but your heart is empty,
    <br>then your life is empty.
    <br>Why can't we take Jesus' counsel in that Book of Matthew 5,
    <br>where Jesus simply said, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
    <br>for they shall be filled"?
    <br>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for the relationship with God for they shall be filled.
    <br>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for salvation for they shall be filled.
    <br>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for their love for Christ for they shall be filled.
    <br>When you make God your heart's delight, you will have your heart's desires,
    <br>in God's time, in His way and for His glory.
    <br>This is how to pray and receive answer - put relationship before results.
    <br>Look after your relationship with God and let God look after the result.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
