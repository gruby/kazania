  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, thank you for your time and your love for God.
    <br>When you talk of Christianity, what is the main thing -
    <br>is it the work we do or the relationship we keep?
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do
    <br>but the relationship we maintain and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.
    <br>The proper relationship brings the proper atmosphere.
    <br>HINDRANCE TO PRAYER
    <br>A good example: you used to be a drunkard, smoker -
    <br>just mention any bad habit - before but now you are a Christian.
    <br>I mean, you are born again; you have stopped them
    <br>but the urge for it is still there.
    <br>Question - are you really born again by God's standard,
    <br>since the urge is still there?
    <br>And we know what the word 'urge' means.
    <br>It is very tormenting, irritating, it is a discomfort, it is painful, distressing.
    <br>When you have the urge to do something, what an agony!
    <br>Affliction - you can regard it as an affliction.
    <br>In this case, only God can know that you are not born again.
    <br>People out there, they have not been seeing you smoking, lying, gambling, this, that.
    <br>They will see you as born again.
    <br>This is the case with church people today.
    <br>Only God can know that you are not born again.
    <br>The fact that people do not see you again in your former bad attitude,
    <br>orientation, character, disposition, does not mean you are truly born again.
    <br>Only God Almighty who knows the heart of man...
    <br>Remember the Book of Matthew 5:8, blessed are those pure in heart,
    <br>for they shall see God.
    <br>Blessed are those pure in heart for they shall see God.
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 2:16, it says we have the mind of God.
    <br>The mind of God is pure.
    <br>Let's take a passage in the Bible.
    <br>The Book of Psalms 66:18:
    <br>"If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear me."
    <br>To regard iniquity is to have the urge.
    <br>When the urge comes, iniquity is talking.
    <br>That is the voice of iniquity.
    <br>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.
    <br>A good example: after stopping your bad habit, you still have the urge,
    <br>the Lord will not hear you.
    <br>To regard iniquity in the heart means that there is some sort or degree of sympathy with sin.
    <br>The state of your mind determines the kind of dreams you will have.
    <br>Can you see the cause of the spiritual attack?
    <br>And you are born again.
    <br>This message is fundamental and this is the standard of God.
    <br>Let someone say, "Hindrance to prayer."
    <br>Blessed are those pure in heart; they shall pray and their prayer shall be answered.
    <br>Remember the faith we talk about, "I have faith in God"...
    <br>Only faith pleases Him.
    <br>What is faith?
    <br>Faith is of man's heart, not of man's mind or flesh.
    <br>This is the case with church people today.
    <br>"I am born again..."
    <br>Why can't you allow the atmosphere to say this?
    <br>What do I mean by atmosphere?
    <br>The atmosphere you belong to will tell people you are born again.
    <br>If truly you are born again, the atmosphere you leave
    <br>will surely produce that blessing.
    <br>The relationship we keep and the atmosphere produced
    <br>by that relationship tell that you are born again.
    <br>If I am standing here and say, "I am Prophet T.B. Joshua",
    <br>that may not be appropriate.
    <br>The atmosphere surrounding me will prove to you that I am Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Anywhere I move to, that atmosphere will surround me.
    <br>It will tell people, "He is born again."
    <br>When you come with your attack, you will see that something will resist you,
    <br>"Yes, there is big hand following this man."
    <br>When you curse this man, you realise that the curse will not reach him,
    <br>"Oh, there is a big hand following this man."
    <br>What you are trying to do seems impossible.
    <br>When this man attempts it, it becomes possible, you know there is a big God.
    <br>What is just not possible for a man seems to be possible for him,
    <br>where there is the finger of God.
    <br>It is the finger of God that makes impossible possible.
    <br>HOW TO REMOVE HINDRANCE TO PRAYER!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Faith must be confessed and faith must be worked out in action.
    <br>Faith must be tested by tribulation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Faith must be confessed with the mouth."
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>Faith must be confessed with the mouth.
    <br>Faith must be worked out in action.
    <br>Faith must be tested by tribulation.
    <br>HOW TO REMOVE HINDRANCE TO PRAYER!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>The situation with church people today:
    <br>They come out and say, "I confess I am a smoker but today I have stopped smoking."
    <br>You will not see them around smoking.
    <br>A criminal saying, "Now, I stopped" and you cannot see them in that action again.
    <br>You should allow God to mark it.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by 'mark it'?
    <br>After you have finished the job;
    <br>God says I should carry this and I carry it.
    <br>It is not just enough for me to come and say, "Yes, I must make it. I have carried it.
    <br>God said I should carry it - I have carried it. Yes, I am a child of God."
    <br>No. God needs to know by what authority you carry it
    <br>because also satan can carry that thing.
    <br>This evil spirit can help to carry that thing, but it is always attached with pain.
    <br>Evil spirits can give you money but with pain.
    <br>They can give you everything you talk about with pain.
    <br>God wants to know.
    <br>It is not enough for you to say, "Yes. I have got it."
    <br>Wait for God to say you have got it.
    <br>After you have successfully finished the job, you need to wait for God to mark it.
    <br>When God marks it, He will come out to say you have made it.
    <br>In the same vein, if you now say, "I am born again",
    <br>because you used to be a drunkard and you stopped this,
    <br>because you used to be a liar and you stopped it,
    <br>because you used to be a very bad boy but you stopped it;
    <br>people have seen me now - I have stopped that nonsense,
    <br>"Yes, the world will see me as a born again."
    <br>But what of the urge to smoke, to do those bad things.
    <br>It is still tormenting you.
    <br>And the urge is very distressing, discomforting - it is an affliction.
    <br>It is a big agony.
    <br>This is what many of you are facing today.
    <br>These are the challenges you are having.
    <br>You say you don't love money and before now you loved money so much.
    <br>That urge for money is tormenting you so much.
    <br>It is this urge of fornication, immorality that leads people to pornography.
    <br>They say, "God said, 'Thou shall not fornicate'. OK, I am born again. I don't fornicate."
    <br>Nobody will see you fornicating but you are doing pornography, masturbation - you are into that.
    <br>That is what you resort to.
    <br>It is that urge.
    <br>But people around will never see you.
    <br>Even when a woman touches you, "No! Don't touch me. I am holy."
    <br>When a man touches you, you say, "No. Don't touch me. I am a woman of God."
    <br>Only God who knows the heart of man can say that you are born again
    <br>because blessed are those pure in heart for they shall see God.
    <br>HOW TO REMOVE HINDRANCE TO PRAYER!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>The fact that people do not see you again in your former bad attitude,
    <br>orientation, character, disposition, does not mean you are truly born again.
    <br>Only God Almighty who knows the heart of man.
    <br>Remember the Book of Matthew 5:8, blessed are those pure in heart,

    <br>Blessed are those pure in heart for they shall see God.
    <br>Everybody has a camera.
    <br>If you stop people from drinking, smoking etc and God is not involved,
    <br>the camera has a memory here - it will be rewinding it.
    <br>He will not do those things but he will still be 'doing it'.
    <br>While sitting down alone, he will be doing it.
    <br>If it is sex, he can make sex without sleeping with anyone.
    <br>The camera is here; he will continue to rewind things he has done in the past.
    <br>The record is here to rewind it.
    <br>What he did 10 years ago - he will rewind it.
    <br>What he did 5 years ago - he will rewind it.
    <br>Last year - he will rewind it.
    <br>He will continue to rewind the record of the past.
    <br>And he will be satisfied, not as doing it.
    <br>And that one is more tormenting than even doing it.
    <br>We have a camera here and this camera recorded every event,
    <br>right from when we were mature to know the right and wrong.
    <br>It has recorded everything you have done in the past.
    <br>When we are born again and God is involved,
    <br>that is the record Jesus destroys first.
    <br>He will destroy the record and remove it from your memory.
    <br>That is the first thing where Jesus go, when He is involved is your conversion.
    <br>The first thing the Holy Spirit will do; He will go to that camera's recording and remove it.
    <br>Now, it is over to you to begin to record your present and future.
    <br>And your present and future are for Jesus.
    <br>So, all the record you had from the beginning when you were mature
    <br>will be removed and destroyed.
    <br>Now, you will begin to record your life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>But if Jesus is not involved in your conversion,
    <br>and you just say, "I am not going to smoke, drink, do this thing again" -
    <br>truly you have the power to stop those things,
    <br>but if God is not involved, the record is there.
    <br>You will just begin to rewind it.
    <br>If you cannot do more now, you have to rewind an event in the past.
    <br>And when you rewind it, you will begin to see you enjoy it.
    <br>That is why it is more dangerous than doing it.
    <br>That is why you always see those who have this serious urge as if
    <br>they have a psychological problem.
    <br>The loss of memory is number one.
    <br>They can easily forget anything, just like that.
    <br>Absence of mind - they can stand and be looking; they forget themselves.
    <br>They can even forget to eat food; they may not eat from morning till night.
    <br>They will not have an urge for food because they had not satisfied their need.
    <br>And this is what our youth nowadays resort to.
    <br>You have a sister, a brother, your children at home;
    <br>you always see them being alone, "He is very decent boy or girl" - it is too early to say that.
    <br>The one he is involved in is more dangerous than going to the hotel, which is very tormenting.
    <br>Don't stand for your children and say, "No. I can stand for my child. My child is decent.
    <br>I will fight a battle." - you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>Even you yourself know the number of urges you have that are tormenting you.
    <br>You know that your children are exposed to technology, internet and all others.
    <br>Everything we can see today; it is given us by those things.
    <br>Father, we are in Your presence.
    <br>Open the door of our hearts and connect us to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Say, "Connect me to the Holy Spirit."
    <br>[Connect me to the Holy Spirit.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Connect me to the Holy Spirit.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Connect me to the Holy Spirit.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Connect me to the Holy Spirit.]
    <br>Open the door of my heart, oh Lord and connect me to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>HOW TO REMOVE HINDRANCE TO PRAYER!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Open the door of my heart, Lord and connect me to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remember the title of the message, "HINDRANCE TO PRAYER".
    <br>You say, "This is what has been hindering me. OK.
    <br>I close my eyes and I don't want to look at it. I am a child of God."
    <br>OK, you are a child of God by sight.
    <br>You are a child of God by faith and faith is of man's heart.
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Come, uncle.
    <br>I look at uncle and say, "No, I don't want to look. It is a temptation. I am a child of God."
    <br>You are not a child of God by sight; you are a child of God by faith
    <br>and faith is of man's heart.
    <br>So, if I say I don't want to look but my heart is yearning for it...
    <br>If my heart is not yearning for it, I will look and I will laugh, "How are you?"
    <br>I will just look and go by my own.
    <br>If my heart is not yearning for it, why should I complain?
    <br>No.
    <br>This is the case with church people today.
    <br>I realise that Christianity today is all about...
    <br>"I am no more doing this, that" but the urge to do them is still there.
    <br>That is what Christianity is all about and that is not God's standard.
    <br>So, I asked God, "What is the way?"
    <br>I can't just wait.
    <br>While you are at home or anywhere, something is about to come,
    <br>something of which I have started talking about.
    <br>The urge, once you are delivered - no.
    <br>To regard iniquity in our heart means there is some sort or degree of sympathy with sin.
    <br>Our heart is the communication or contact point.
    <br>The Bible says he that believes has eternal life.
    <br>It does not say, "He that confesses."
    <br>Confession is one but that 'believe';
    <br>anyone can confess Jesus but not everyone can say, "I believe" in truth and and faith.
    <br>He that believes has eternal life.
    <br>This means, the moment you believe, you have it.
    <br>Believing is possessing.
    <br>As soon as you believe, you receive.
    <br>The moment you believe, you receive.
