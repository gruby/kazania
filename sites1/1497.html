  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Say, "How great is our God."
    <br>Raise your hands and give thanks to God for His goodness.
    <br>He has done great things in our lives.
    <br>That's why we are here today.
    <br>As you stand, review the track record of what God has done in your life.
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Thank You for dying in my place.
    <br>You are my Redeemer, my Saviour, my Strength and my Peace.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>I will ask my question louder: How are you today?!
    <br>You mean it?
    <br>Really?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>My name is Racine.
    <br>By the special grace of God, I'm here to share this message with you
    <br>and I believe by the time you hear this message, your fear will disappear,
    <br>your trouble will be settled,
    <br>in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remember,
    <br>Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour, the Way, the Truth and the Life
    <br>said, in the Book of John 4:22, to the Samaritan woman, "You worship what you do not know..."
    <br>The greatest problem we have in the world today is that people serve a god they do not know.
    <br>Many try to figure God out of their ordinary minds.
    <br>Some, with scientific frame of mind, x-ray the Bible, x-ray the Word.
    <br>Some ask: Can this be true? Is this from God?
    <br>How can a man enter his mother's womb and be born again?
    <br>Why are they vomiting? Why are they shaking? Why are they falling?
    <br>There is no logical explanation to every act of God.
    <br>All we need is to know the truth concerning that act.
    <br>Remember, the Bible says in the Book of Psalms 103:7
    <br>that knowing God is not only to see His miracles but to learn His ways.
    <br>Moses' physical appearance made him a man
    <br>but his works made him a prophet, mighty in words and in deeds.
    <br>The Scripture says:
    <br>To know the truth, our knowledge of the Holy Bible must be broad and holistic.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is exact knowledge, there is perfect knowledge,
    <br>there is complete knowledge in the Word of God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>there is exact knowledge, there is complete knowledge in the Word of God."
    <br>Today I believe you will know the truth and you will be free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>This leads us to our message today:
    <br>THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The knowledge of the truth."
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of John 8:31.
    <br>"Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him,
    <br>'If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed.
    <br>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'
    <br>They answered Him, 'We are Abraham's descendants,
    <br>and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can You say, "You will be made free"?'
    <br>Jesus answered them, 'Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.
    <br>And a slave does not abide in the house forever, but a son abides forever.
    <br>Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.' "
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua says there are two kinds of truth.
    <br>We have sense-knowledge truth
    <br>and we have revelation truth.
    <br>What do we mean my sense knowledge?
    <br>Truth is beyond externals.
    <br>We call 'externals' what we see, what we hear, what others tell, what circumstances look like.
    <br>Externals is the realm of sense knowledge; it is all about facts and facts can change.
    <br>I don't know what fact is condemning you today; no condition is permanent - that fact can change.
    <br>I don't know what trouble brought you here today.
    <br>All I know is that you need to know the truth and the truth will set you free.
    <br>One may be familiar with the original Greek or Hebrew texts of the Scriptures,
    <br>one may know the history about the Word
    <br>but all this is baseless, all this is wasted energy, if you do not act on the Word
    <br>because knowing facts about God cannot change our relationship with Him.
    <br>What do I mean by 'facts'?
    <br>The name, the Christian title you bear, the name of the church you attend -
    <br>the Scripture says the membership of our local church or community is merely symbolic.
    <br>What matters, what counts is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
    <br>To be saved is to have the revelation of the glory of God.
    <br>Therefore, we need to come to the knowledge of the divine truth.
    <br>Let someone say, "Revelation truth."
    <br>So many people today lack absolute confidence in what they believe in.
    <br>That is why they lose focus and balance when the answer to their prayers seems to delay in coming.
    <br>Such was the case of King Saul in the Book of 1 Samuel 28.
    <br>He allowed his situation and fears to mislead him.
    <br>In search for the truth about what he faced,
    <br>he turned to the world of falsehood, he went to visit a witchdoctor.
    <br>When things were good with him,
    <br>the Scripture says he drove away all the witchdoctors and fortune tellers,
    <br>and he did away with all practices that had to do with idolatry and sorcery
    <br>but when times became hard and difficult for him,
    <br>when the answer to his prayers seemed to delay in forthcoming,
    <br>he went back to the old evil practices and we all know what happened to him.
    <br>This is the case of so many of us today.
    <br>What is the cause of this?
    <br>The unrenewed mind is always waging war in his heart between faith and doubt;
    <br>it's always waging warfare with unbelief -
    <br>confessing the Word of God with the mouth and yet denying it in action.
    <br>What is the way out?
    <br>Instead of magnifying the causes of our fears and troubles,
    <br>we need to equip ourselves with the thoughts of God, His sovereignty and invisible world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Jesus said, 'Fear not; I have overcome the world for you.
    <br>You will know the truth and the truth will set you free'.
    <br>By a look of faith to Jesus, that giant, that mountain
    <br>today will disappear, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>We believers, what gives us peace is not what we see but what we believe.
    <br>Like Paul and Silas in the midst of the prison.
    <br>We believers, we rejoice.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because we see the invisible, we believe the impossible
    <br>and we receive the incredible because Jesus is alive!
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Do you believe that there is a solution for you?
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Unfortunately, so many out there confess faith
    <br>but they are not living according to the truth of the Word of God.
    <br>The question is:
    <br>What is the relationship between faith and truth?
    <br>The man of God says that as a practising Christian, faith exists in three levels:
    <br>knowledge of the truth, acceptance of the truth and commitment to the truth.
    <br>It is one thing to know the truth;
    <br>it is another thing to accept that truth in the midst of your heart
    <br>and another thing to commit your life to that truth.
    <br>Ask Nicodemus and he will tell you that if you don't take time to find out the truth,
    <br>you will never come to the knowledge of the truth.
    <br>Thank you that you are here today.
    <br>Many are here because of what they had seen on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Is it true? Is it real?
    <br>Many are here to find out the truth from God's point of view.
    <br>But remember:
    <br>Nicodemus did not sit down somewhere and come to a hasty decision about Jesus.
    <br>He chose not to rely on his own way, on his own thinking; he came to Jesus to find out the truth.
    <br>I don't know what doubt is harassing you but I want you to know this truth:
    <br>Jesus Christ does not mind your doubts
    <br>as long as you are seeking answers from Him in the midst of that doubt.
    <br>Jesus sent forth the Word of revelation to him and told him,
    <br>'Verily, verily, unless a man is born again, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God.'
    <br>Jesus sent forth the revealing Word of God to him
    <br>and Nicodemus received the truth in the midst of his heart and was delivered from all prejudices
    <br>and he began to stand for Jesus in the court of the Pharisees.
    <br>That I have the knowledge that Jesus is Lord, does not mean I can cause you to believe that.
    <br>The Scripture says that you must get that revelation yourself in order to apply it in your life.
    <br>Let someone say, "Not only to know the truth but to accept the truth in the midst of your heart."
    <br>In the Book of Acts 16:14
    <br>we have a lady of noble character called Lydia
    <br>and the Scripture says she was listening to the message Paul was preaching.
    <br>When God saw in her a genuine desire to know the truth,
    <br>God opened her heart to harken to the message.
    <br>This means that our heart is the instrument to hear from God and to talk to God.
    <br>Say, "My heart is God's instrument for discerning the truth."
    <br>The Word of God can only quicken us spiritually when that Word is affected by the Holy Ghost,
    <br>when it is illumined by the Spirit of God.
    <br>When the Word is illumined by the Holy Spirit, it enters our heart and when it does,
    <br>our heart and mind will act upon that Word.
    <br>Her heart was opened, her mind was opened, she accepted the Word.
    <br>She believed the Word and committed her life to the Word and became an agent of truth
    <br>and she followed Jesus.
    <br>It is one thing to believe the truth about you;
    <br>it is another thing to stand for the truth in the midst of tests and trials.
    <br>What you are passing through today is just a test of faith.
    <br>The God we serve does not dodge crises - He sees them as a challenge.
    <br>Therefore, remain an agent of truth in the midst of tests and trials.
    <br>We need to commit ourselves to the truth.
    <br>Let someone say, "Commitment to the truth."
    <br>In John 1:43-47
    <br>Philip called Nathanael to embrace the promised Messiah, Jesus Christ of Nazareth
    <br>and he said, "Can anything good come from Nazareth?"
    <br>Can anything good come from Nigeria?
    <br>Can anything good come from that place?
    <br>This is prejudice.
    <br>Let someone say, "Prejudice."
    <br>If man's prejudice be not conquered by the evidence of the truth, it is but confirmed.
    <br>When he came to Jesus, Jesus sent forth the Word of truth about Him
    <br>and immediately the Word of revelation brought him to conviction and real movement
    <br>and he surrendered and said, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel."
    <br>Let someone say, "All acts of faith are acts of self-surrender to God."
    <br>Tell your neighbour again, "All acts of faith are acts of self-surrender to God."
    <br>We need to have absolute confidence in God that He is working out the answer for you.
    <br>He knows you.
    <br>That I have the revelation today that Jesus is Lord, the Way, the Truth and the Life,
    <br>does not mean I can get you to believe that revelation;
    <br>you must get that revelation yourself and apply it to your life.
    <br>No matter your situation today, no matter the doubt, no matter the challenges you are facing,
    <br>today you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.
    <br>Welcome to the arena of liberty!
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, welcome to the arena of liberty!"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, have a look of faith to Jesus Christ."
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>He is the Healer, He is the Deliverer, He is the Saviour.
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>He never said there would be no more healing;
    <br>He never said there would be no more deliverance.
    <br>If you believe in His name, today your case will become an argument.
    <br>If you come to Him, you will be free.
    <br>Let someone say, "Time with Christ Jesus is time with healing, deliverance, salvation."
    <br>Finally brethren,
    <br>we don't know God by our feelings, our emotions but through His Word - the Holy Bible.
    <br>The Bible is the letter inspired by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>This means that knowledge of the truth is not an intellectual thing;
    <br>it is not an ordinary thing to be discussed,
    <br>it is a spiritual truth that needs to be discerned and operated spiritually.
    <br>And when it does, you will know the blessed truth that set you free.
    <br>When you believe the Word of truth and confess the Word of truth,
    <br>you will find yourself in the world of truth, where the true light comes from -
    <br>the light that shuns every shade of darkness in our lives.
    <br>When you believe in Him, you know that truth.
    <br>What is that truth?
    <br>Believing is possessing.
    <br>Let someone say, "Believing is possessing."
    <br>The instant you believe, you possess the Father's nature.
    <br>The instant you believe, you possess what the Bible has guaranteed -
    <br>the inheritance of the saints.
    <br>Then your heart will rest with a quiet sense of security because Jesus is by your side.
    <br>May God bless His Word, in Jesus' name.
