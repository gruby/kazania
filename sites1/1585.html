  <p>    
    <br>Let's quickly look at 2 Corinthians - the case of Paul.
    <br>2 Corinthians 12:7
    <br>"... because of these surpassingly great revelations.
    <br>Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited"
    <br>- that is self-important, arrogant.
    <br>Many of you don't know the reason why you are going through what you are going through
    <br>- you may not know.
    <br>Listen to Paul.
    <br>"Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited,
    <br>I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of satan, to torment me."
    <br>That shows, what you too are complaining about,
    <br>the pain you are complaining about is from the pit of hell,
    <br>it is a product of satan - Paul is complaining about the same here.
    <br>"I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of satan, to torment me.
    <br>Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me."
    <br>The Bible says, three times he pleaded to the Lord.
    <br>Each time is thousand times.
    <br>The Bible just summarized the issue,
    <br>but each time is one thousand times -
    <br>times three is three thousand times.
    <br>This is an Apostle of God.
    <br>Knowing how to believe that God hears our prayers,
    <br>knowing how to believe that God hears when you pray,
    <br>is a much greater blessing
    <br>because a prayer of faith can be repeated ten thousand times.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>Knowing how to believe that God hears you when you pray,
    <br>is a much greater blessing than anything
    <br>because a prayer of faith can be repeated ten thousand times.
    <br>God does as He wills.
    <br>Sometimes God may not give what we want instantly for reasons known to Him.
    <br>It may be to strengthen your desire the more.
    <br>The Lord knows that when you get there and receive it, you may go back to the world.
    <br>What is the essence of receiving it?
    <br>To strengthen your desire and determination...
    <br>He is God.
    <br>He is doing all this for the salvation of you soul.
    <br>He is doing all this for eternal life.
    <br>But when you get there, "God, heal me..."
    <br>The Lord will look at you, "If this man is healed, he will go back to the night club.
    <br>What is the essence of healing him?"
    <br>He will now hold on; He wants you to continue...
    <br>You will be seeing healing going on, others being healed.
    <br>When you see others being healed, that will encourage you to come back again.
    <br>In that process, your desire and determination will be strengthened.
    <br>- For who?
    <br>- [For God.]
    <br>That will enable you to see the bad side of going to a night club.
    <br>Sometimes you need time and preparation.
    <br>Rome was not built in one day, while some ... - they are ready.
    <br>When they receive, you will never see them going back.
    <br>But some, if they have not seen enough darkness,
    <br>if you give them light, they may lose it instantly.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All you need now is to be where God wants you to be just like Paul Apostle.
    <br>He was where God wanted him to be.
    <br>Three times he pleaded to the Lord, "Heal me. Heal me. Heal me".
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Over to you.
    <br>So be ready when you receive.
    <br>When you have that breakthrough, you will not go back to the darkness.
    <br>Over to you - there is no "Amen" in this way - I'm not praying, I'm just telling you.
    <br>The first thing after coming back home - begin to clean those charms, rings -
    <br>pack them and drop them into the sea and say, "Bye".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After getting there, receiving Living Water, your prayer,
    <br>come back to your seat and watch again others,
    <br>"It is happening. This thing I have - see what it is doing to others."
    <br>By the time you see it, you will know how to treasure it - not just taking it and going back home.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Go back to your seat, sit down and watch others.
    <br>Others who received - if I were you, I would find them to meet secretly.
    <br>In order to build your faith, meet those who gave testimony,
    <br>"You have vomited blood - how did you manage?
    <br>Do you have blood in your mouth?
    <br>Do you have blood on your tongue? Tell me."
    <br>You need to build your faith.
    <br>It is a decision before going there.
    <br>The decision you make will determine whether to receive or not.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The decision you make will determine whether to receive or not.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[The decision you make will determine whether to receive or not.]
    <br>We are talking of holding offence, pain of the past.
    <br>And you are still holding pain of the past and you are going there.
    <br>What are you going there to do?
    <br>The heavenly beings that are there - do you know what they do?
    <br>Many people are there - they will just move, "Touch this one".
    <br>"Look at this one; he is not ready" - they will leave you.
    <br>"Touch this one. This one is not ready."
    <br>Some refusing to leave - they will kick them.
    <br>That is why when you see some people...
    <br>You don't know somebody is kicking you.
    <br>Just one kick - you will find yourself on the floor.
    <br>Some, when being kicked, will not shout,
    <br>they will see that the place is not comfortable for them to stay.
    <br>They are there.
    <br>You will just go.
    <br>In the midst of the people - they will touch some of them - they are the ones touching there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>They said to me, "Talk, we take care".
    <br>What you are seeing now - you may not know what it is,
    <br>until each country has it in its country.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Each country has heavenly site,
    <br>and you see people trooping there, all over the world.
    <br>Each country!
    <br>I do not need to go there, I'm not the one working there
    <br>and I cannot collect a penny for that.
    <br>Me too - I need that.
    <br>When you will be going, I will join you to take my own.
    <br>Therefore, there is no need for you to bring money.
    <br>It will come to a point, when you get there: if you want to see them, you will see them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That you are where God wants you to be does not mean you are out of touch.
    <br>This is exactly what happened to Paul Apostle.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "That I am where God wants me to be does not mean I am out of touch".
    <br>Do you know the meaning of that?
    <br>Temptation can touch you.
    <br>Sickness can touch you.
    <br>Pain can touch you.
    <br>They can only touch you.
    <br>In this world there will be tribulation.
    <br>Cheer up!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You, as a Christian, believe, "I should not be sick. I shouldn't have trouble.
    <br>I should not have setback".
    <br>This is what is deceiving you.
    <br>Once you are sick, you have forgotten what the Bible says
    <br>that all those things are for our spiritual benefit.
    <br>The sickness is for your spiritual benefit, to improve your relationship with God.
    <br>Look at what you have done to me - as a result of serious attacks launched at me...
    <br>In the history, since a hundred years, there was no man of God, no pastor, no bishop
    <br>that has ever faced the persecution I faced.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But all these persecutions are for my spiritual benefit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why has your own persecution now turned to crisis?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Why has your own turned to crisis?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because this is crisis.
    <br>Little attack - your business fails, damage...
    <br>That should not be like that.
    <br>If you are where God wants you to be, He will speak His strength in your attack.
    <br>Take your pen and write it.
    <br>Why has your own attack destroyed your marriage, family, business, health?
    <br>Because you are not where God wants you to be.
    <br>Paul Apostle's attack did not destroy him and we never learned that the attack killed him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That attack never stopped his ministry.
    <br>The greater the attack, the more the grace of God in his life.
    <br>But what happened to you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are talking of witches, wizards - they attack you, they are the ones damaging your leg, stomach,
    <br>damaging this, giving you this, that...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>Because of an attack, we have run helter skelter,
    <br>witch doctors, occultists, some joined secret cults, some abandoned their faith.
    <br>He said to us, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>That shows He foresaw something that would attack your faith.
    <br>If I say, "I pray you reach your home",
    <br>that shows something will happen to you on the road.
    <br>If I say, "Come, let me pray for you; I pray you will reach home",
    <br>it means they will attack you on the way.
    <br>That is the meaning of "I pray you reach home".
    <br>Jesus said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>That shows something will definitely attack you, will attack your faith.
    <br>But what is happening today?
    <br>The thorn in his flesh was from the pit of hell, a messenger of satan, just as yours.
    <br>It doesn't say it is from Heaven - it says, it is from the pit of hell, from satan who is attacking you.
    <br>As you are complaining, "satan, demon, witchcraft, witches, this" - the same way...
    <br>That you are where God wants you to be does not mean you are out of touch.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[That you are where God wants you to be does not mean you are out of touch.]
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[That you are where God wants you to be does not mean you are out of touch.]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[That you are where God wants you to be does not mean you are out of touch.]
    <br>So, I want to leave you now.
    <br>You are going back to your mountain.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you know the reason why I want you to go back there?
    <br>Because you don't know where you are going.
    <br>God just wants to reveal - and He can reveal to anyone - for the pure heart.
    <br>Unforgiving spirit - you will go there, you will not see anything.
    <br>You will rub your body, your body will just get dirty.
    <br>Unforgiving what?
    <br>You hold pain of the past.
    <br>Somebody sacked you; you would have been the general manager of the company;
    <br>you will never forgive that man who sacked you, that lied against you.
    <br>If you continue to hold that offence and you get there,
    <br>you will just rub your body on the dust.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I was a type that holds offence, would you come here today?
    <br>You know what you have done to me in the past.
    <br>I can see your mouth, "Rebuke, bind".
    <br>Do you know what you have done to me?
    <br>Think about what you have done to me in the past.
    <br>If you say you have not done anything to me, what of your brothers and sisters at home?
    <br>How you were binding me, loosing me.
    <br>"Over my dead body, I will never come here."
    <br>And you say you continue to hold an offence - for what?
    <br>This is it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The destiny that has been lost - recover it here!
    <br>So please, God loves and values you.
    <br>You are where His Holy Spirit dwells.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"God loves me and values me.
    <br>I am where His Holy Spirit dwells."
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[God loves me and values me.
    <br>I am where His Holy Spirit dwells.]
    <br>Again and again - write it down.
    <br>[God loves me and values me.
    <br>I am where His Holy Spirit dwells.]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[God loves me and values me.
    <br>I am where His Holy Spirit dwells.]
    <br>Yes!
    <br>He loves you and values you.
    <br>You are where His Holy Spirit dwells.
    <br>This is a platform for you to recover your career.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is a platform for me to recover my career, future, business, finances,
    <br>marriage, family and my good health".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have to finish your reconciliation in your heart.
    <br>Reconcile your account - unforgiving spirit, pain of the past, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>If there is anyone you have kept in prison, 
    <br>for killing your loved one, stealing your property -
    <br>you went to court and this person was arrested, taken to jail, or whatever -
    <br>when you leave here, meet your lawyer for counselling and how to go about it.
    <br>Find time, go to the prison, pay a visit to such a fellow,
    <br>"I want to come and visit you, to let you know that old things passed away.
    <br>I'm working on how to get you out of this mess".
    <br>Let him know and start working it out.
    <br>Let go off the offence, unforgiving spirit, pain of the past.
    <br>You need to know where you are going.
    <br>If you know where you are going, forgiveness will be your roadmap.
    <br>Lord, make me Your channel, Your channel of forgiveness where there is sin.
    <br>Lord, make me Your channel, Your channel of pardon where there is injury.
    <br>Your business will not remain the same!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Everything you have lost, you will recover them!
    <br>Testimony!
    <br>Everybody has pain.
    <br>Some pain of business, finances, marriage.
    <br>So, different pains; not everyone is carrying placards.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have neck pain and eyes pain, I have a stiff neck.
    <br>Man of God, my right hand cannot work and I cannot sleep - I sleep seated.
    <br>I have lumbar spondylosis.
    <br>- How long?
    <br>- For fifteen years now.
    <br>I also wear a lumbar corset because of the pains in the waist.
    <br>The pains are too much.
    <br>- The pains are too much?
    <br>- Yes, even drugs don't help me again.
    <br>- Drugs cannot help you again?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- So, that is why you run to God?
    <br>- Yes. I know that Jesus will do it for me.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Man of God, help me; I'm Janet Nsokolo from Zambia.
    <br>I have got osteoarthritis of both knees and achilles tendinitis.
    <br>I drink pain killers every time.
    <br>You drink what?
    <br>Painkillers.
    <br>You want to drink the Living Water now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK.
    <br>My name is Clifford Ezudu, I'm from Anambra State.
