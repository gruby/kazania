    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>You may have your seat, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>It's a new dawn.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>What a wonderful blessing! Give thanks to God! Give thanks to Him!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's take the Book of James 1.
    <br>Let's look at the verses 2 to 4 there.
    <br>New Testament.
    <br>Trials and Temptations.
    <br>"Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds,
    <br>because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
    <br>Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."
    <br>Also take your time to look at the Book of 2 Corinthians 12:7
    <br>and the Book of Job 23:10.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>This means that what you are going through as a Christian - just name them -
    <br>are tests to mature you.
    <br>You say, "Poverty, hardship, sickness, disease" as a Christian -
    <br>a Christian can be sick and yet be what?
    <br>You say, "Because you are a Christian, no sickness" - no!
    <br>In that Book of James, 2 Corinthians 12:7 and Job 23:10,
    <br>trials - name them: poverty, hardship, setback, stagnation - are tests to mature you.
    <br>In your establishment every year, if you want to be promoted, you need to sit for a test.
    <br>When you pass, they promote you.
    <br>In your school days, it was the same way.
    <br>They are meant to shake your faith - nothing more.
    <br>That sickness, that disease, that hardship - whatever you call it -
    <br>are meant to shake your faith -  nothing more.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sin easily hides where there is no heat of trial.
    <br>What is your trial?
    <br>Your trial can be sickness, poverty, hardship.
    <br>Sin easily hides where there is no heat of trial.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't try to escape them because they are meant to mature you.
    <br>Many of us, before coming here, you know what happened to you
    <br>concerning the situation you brought here today.
    <br>You have been to witch doctors, a lot of things you might have done.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The solution God gives is not as the world gives.
    <br>What many of us were supposed to go through is what we are going through now
    <br>because you had someone there to help you.
    <br>If all this help is not sanctioned by God, it cannot help you.
    <br>Your brother that has billions of naira - they can give you billions.
    <br>But if that billion is not sanctioned by God, you are receiving billion trouble.
    <br>Will of your family - he willed billions of property to your care.
    <br>If those billions are not sanctioned by God, you are receiving billions of trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You keep asking yourself, "Why is all this so much on me?
    <br>I have helped, I have received a loan from the bank,
    <br>a lot of loan from finance bank".
    <br>Yet, see what is happening to you.
    <br>But if all this is not sanctioned by God, it cannot help you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why all this?
    <br>When we are going through trials such as poverty, hardship, stagnation - whatever you call it -
    <br>they may be painful but they serve the purpose of cleansing.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by cleansing? To separate impurities.
    <br>When gold must be gold, it must pass through the furnace.
    <br>See me here.
    <br>This is what I am going through and great, great, great...
    <br>You know what you have said about me in the past and what you have done in the past.
    <br>"Over my dead body will I come to Synagogue."
    <br>You are welcome.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It may be painful.
    <br>That trial you are going through - the sickness, disease -
    <br>it may be very painful, no doubt about that,
    <br>but they serve the purpose of cleansing, as a Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Should we always receive good and not bad?"
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[Should we always receive good and not bad?]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Should we always receive good and not bad?]
    <br>Job said to his wife, "Should we always receive good and not bad?"
    <br>Our walking with the Lord - both good and hard times.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why we have day and night.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Something must...
    <br>But you have regarded all this as enemy.
    <br>After this message, I believe, you will be bold enough to face your challenges
    <br>with joy and hope.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>While going through your challenges, honour God before men.
    <br>"What happened?"
    <br>You start wearing rugs.
    <br>So, what we are saying:
    <br>While going through your trial - whatever kind of trial, poverty, hardship -
    <br>honour God before men.
    <br>Do you know what I mean?
    <br>You know when we are going through our trial, there is trouble -
    <br>"Madam, what happened?"
    <br>"Hmm..."
    <br>That is not honour to God.
    <br>You are telling men that God is not able.
    <br>It is time to smile, laugh.
    <br>- "How are you?"
    <br>- "Fine."
    <br>Because you know God is there.
    <br>He is able.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "While going through your trial, honour God before men".
    <br>People will begin to ask you, your landlord will begin to ask you,
    <br>your neighbour will begin to ask you, even your children will be worried, "Mummy, what's wrong?"
    <br>"My vehicle needs overhauling. I will not be able to go to church today."
    <br>Ha.
    <br>While going through your trial, honour God before men.
    <br>"What is wrong?"
    <br>Imagine you are fasting - fasting is not a time to be moody;
    <br>it's a time of joy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to leave you with this word.
    <br>While going through your trial, honour God before men.
    <br>It's not a time men will ask you, "What is wrong? What has happened to you?
    <br>What has happened, brother? What can I do for you?"
    <br>Our trials are meant to shake our faith - nothing more.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again, "My trials are meant to shake my faith - nothing more".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[My trials are meant to shake my faith - nothing more.]
    <br>Honour God before men.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Message Title:
    <br>HONOUR GOD IN TRIALS
    <br>What message are you taking home?
    <br>Our trials and tests are meant to mature us.
    <br>You are not mature?
    <br>Does it mean you are not mature?
    <br>Spiritually.
    <br>Over to you, brother.
    <br>Honour God.
    <br>Honour God for what?
    <br>Before men.
    <br>You have to honour God before men while going through your trial - whatever trial -
    <br>because our trial is for the purpose of cleansing - to clean you.
    <br>We Christians should know this.
    <br>A message that says, "Everything prosperity. Everywhere, everything is good" - no!
    <br>You should be ready.
    <br>When it comes, you should be ready to honour God before men.
    <br>It's not the time to look sad - complaining, murmuring, lamenting.
    <br>When you see people lamenting, complaining in your community and he is a Christian,
    <br>you should know, this is not a Christian.
    <br>You have to honour God before men because our God is able.
    <br>Hallelujah.
