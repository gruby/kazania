  <p>    
    <br>There is a gentleman – you are a witch doctor.
    <br>You need to come out because your situation demands for me to see you.
    <br>As we are here, people are waiting in your house to see you.
    <br>You are a witch doctor.
    <br>Please, come out – Jesus loves you.
    <br>After hearing the prophecy from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, the witch doctor comes forward.
    <br>Man of God, I am the witch doctor you were talking about.
    <br>- You are a witch doctor?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>After the service, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The power of the Holy Spirit causes many to fall under the anointing.
    <br>When the witch doctor, who received the prophecy comes forward, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for him,
    <br>and every chain that satan used to connect him to himself is broken, putting an end to his past,
    <br>and giving birth to his future, in Jesus' name.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is His Mystical Majesty Dr. Prof. Anayo Umumakwe.
    <br>Originally I'm from Imo State but I reside in Enugu State, Nigeria - that is where I stay and practice.
    <br>The next person to me is my beautiful and humble wife,
    <br>and my third son,
    <br>and this is the last boy.
    <br>The other two boys are not here.
    <br>Can you tell us as a witch doctor...
    <br>You introduced yourself as a "Mystical Majesty".
    <br>Now, tell us, how you practice this witch doctor's art, and how did it all begin.
    <br>My mother told me that I stayed 18 months in the womb.
    <br>So, when I was born, they said they went somewhere, because my family has an idol-worshipping background.
    <br>There were so many great men before me; they said I was the next high priest.
    <br>At the age of 16 I started having hallucinations, I could not stay in the class, I was living in a dormitory.
    <br>Sometimes, I left the dormitory and went to sleep in the bush.
    <br>Sometimes, I would go and sleep in an uncompleted building.
    <br>Something used to tell me; there was something that used to talk to me,
    <br>"Go away from here, these people want to kill you".
    <br>You mean you used to hear voices at that tender age?
    <br>Yes, I used to hear voices.
    <br>When my parents got to know this, they said they went somewhere,
    <br>and they said that the time for me to start my work has come.
    <br>We were living in Abia State, so we went home.
    <br>My grandmother and my father were alive then;
    <br>they brought a very known herbal doctor, known all over in my area.
    <br>He came and performed the rite; they made the shrine for me.
    <br>In that shrine a clay-pot was half-buried in the ground, and they used sticks to make the shrine.
    <br>A cock was killed, and they said I should put my hand in that clay-pot.
    <br>I put my two hands; they used the blood to wash my hands inside that pot.
    <br>They put so many things in that pot which I cannot remember now.
    <br>They told me that it was my shrine; that whenever I had a problem,
    <br>I should come to this place and talk to the ancestors,
    <br>and whenever I started doing my work, this was were my powers lay.
    <br>Any person that came to me; I should bring anything brought by that person; fowl, goats or cow -
    <br>I would bring it to this oracle.
    <br>So, I went back to school.
    <br>When I went back to school, the conditions became worse, but I managed to finish my secondary school.
    <br>When I finished secondary school...
    <br>Apart from all these things, I was still very intelligent at school.
    <br>My parents wanted me to read law.
    <br>I asked my father, "You said that I was a chief priest, a high priest.
    <br>What am I going to do at the university? Let me start the work."
    <br>He said, "No".
    <br>So that spirit was there pushing you to start the work as a priest?
    <br>Yes, the spirit started directing me.
    <br>Some people, to whom I wasn't introduced to, would even come to me saying they were sick.
    <br>They would say that there was somebody who told them that I had powers and that I should heal them.
    <br>I was going to the bush to bring leaves, then I would put them together, and the people would say they're OK.
    <br>Other people would come.
    <br>So, I believed that that was my calling.
    <br>I refused to go to the university.
    <br>I was very intelligent; my father wanted me to read law.
    <br>I said, "No".
    <br>I ran away from house - that was what the spirit told me.
    <br>So, because of this witch doctor practice or calling, that you believed you received,
    <br>you were unable to go further in your education, to the university?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But initially, when you started, you introduced yourself as a "Professor Doctor"...
    <br>No, His Mystical Majesty!
    <br>"His Mystical Majesty",
    <br>and Professor Doctor...
    <br>Yeah, Doctor Professor.
    <br>How did you come about this, sir?
    <br>Anayo Umumakwe & Family
    <br>Former Mystical Arts Practitioner
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>No, these things, they came spontaneously.
    <br>At any stage, they would tell me what to do, what to say.
    <br>What really happened was - that when I left the house, I ran to Owerri and entered the police.
    <br>My parents didn't know where I was.
    <br>I was about 3-4 months in the training school.
    <br>My father eventually found me; I don't know how they managed to find me in the police college.
    <br>My father went to the commandant and reported that I was his son, and he wanted to go home with me,
    <br>that they had made arrangements for me to enter the university.
    <br>Then the commandant asked my father to bring me inside the office.
    <br>He asked me, "Young man, do you really like police work?"
    <br>I said, "Yes, I want to do police work."
    <br>Then he begged my father to leave me; that maybe this was my calling.
    <br>My father went away.
    <br>When I finished the training, I was supposed to come to Lagos.
    <br>I don't know who told them that I was a native doctor.
    <br>In the night, when convulsions got the children of our officers, they would come and wake me in the night,
    <br>saying that they heard that I was a native doctor, and I would treat that person.
    <br>My fellow recruits, when they were sick, would come to me and tell me that they heard that I was a native doctor.
    <br>I would just enter the bush and bring 1 or 2 leaves, which I don't even know.
    <br>Sometimes, I would squeeze it and give it to them to drink.
    <br>After that, they would be well.
    <br>People would continue to come more and more.
    <br>I left the police and went to a village; there is a village in the east,
    <br>which is known for traditional healing and 419, and all dubious characters.
    <br>I went to the village with my wife.
    <br>By then, I only had one son and the second one was in the womb.
    <br>We lived there for some time.
    <br>Then, I graduated, I learnt.
    <br>People were saying, "You are very powerful. Any person you give medicine gets healed.
    <br>Why don't you do like this; so that you get big money from people?"
    <br>Eventually, the federal government invaded that village because of too much atrocities.
    <br>Then, I ran away with my wife and my son; we went back to Aba, where we were living.
    <br>I continued to practise this thing.
    <br>Eventually, the goverment of Abia State started wiping other states with these Bakassi boys.
    <br>I felt that maybe they would come after me, because by then I had touched too many people's lives.
    <br>OK, so that place you visited,; where there are witch doctors, who are also into 419 and others;
    <br>tell us what are the things you learnt there, and what are the things you began to practise.
    <br>They taught me how to "wash money", how to "speak as a spirit", so people would believe that the spirit is talking.
    <br>Before then I hadn't known those things, so I combined it with my own, natural knowledge.
    <br>Was there anything like "washing money"?
    <br>No! Actually there is nothing like "washing money";
    <br>all those things are devil's ways of tricking and cheating people.
    <br>Money is only printed by a central bank; you cannot wash or invoke money.
    <br>They taught me how to do these invocations and how to "wash money".
    <br>I left that place and went to Enugu when they started ransacking the area.
    <br>I went with my wife; by then the other child had been born - we went to Enugu.
    <br>When we went to Enugu, I started practising these things again; by then I started to sell drugs, Indian hemp.
    <br>People were coming to buy Indian hemp and with other problems.
    <br>Eventually, at that time, I started selling even the cocaine and I smoked...
    <br>I smoked to an extent that my wife got worried, we were always quarrelling.
    <br>She was asking, "When will you leave this thing? This thing has destroyed many lives."
    <br>Often, police would come to the house, raid our house, see my wife's jewellery and money
    <br>because she had a provisional store, where she was selling.
    <br>They would steal her money and jewellery, they would say that this was "drug money".
    <br>Most of the times, they would put me in detention, where only my wife would visit me.
    <br>By then, I didn't have any relations, where I could take refuge.
    <br>It was my wife who came to the police to bail me.
    <br>After some time, she got tired.
    <br>She told me that if I didn't stop this business, I would go to prison.
    <br>I considered that aspect and I left drugs business, but I was still doing this "herbal business".
    <br>When I went to the river, I would make invocations.
    <br>There are certain foods that fish like; when you throw this thing into the water, water will make a very big noise,
    <br>because all the fish would come to eat that thing.
    <br>Then you tell them that the mermaid has come out.
    <br>OK.
    <br>To get you clear; you mean - when people come to you to do some job for them...
    <br>What are the problems they would complain about, before you take them to the river,
    <br>to make all those sacrifices?
    <br>Some complain of barrenness, of bad business, some other problems -
    <br>maybe sudden death in the family, hatred, and other problems.
    <br>I would take them to the river, telling them that it was a river mermaid that would solve this problem.
    <br>So, you used to tell them that you have a river mermaid that would solve their problem?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How do you get the attention of the river mermaid, what are the tricks you used to deceive the people?
    <br>You know this "macaroni", or the other long one?
    <br>You soak it in water; fish like worms...
    <br>When you soak it in water, you will take it to the river.
    <br>The moment you put it inside the river, the river will make a very big noise,
    <br>because all the fish will come to eat it.
    <br>You tell them that the mermaid has come.
    <br>They would be behind me; then, I would change my voice...
    <br>So, you mean your clients would stand behind you?
    <br>They would stand behind me.
    <br>You would be facing...?
    <br>I would be facing the river.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Then, after doint that, I would take both my hands up and say, "Remember, that you promised me
    <br>that whenever I come to you, you would answer me. Come now and answer me.
    <br>I brought Mr. "so and so" for "so and so" problem, and he wants the problem to be solved."
    <br>Who were you speaking to, or who were you pretending to be speaking to?
    <br>I was speaking to the mermaid that has come out now, as a result of...
    <br>Anayo Umumakwe & Family
    <br>Former Mystical Arts Practitioner
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Amen.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>You mean, at the time you got there with your client, your client was standing behind you,
    <br>and you were facing the river, after throwing that "macaroni" or "spaghetti" into the water,
    <br>all the fish would gather to eat, you would tell them, "Oh, the mermaid has come!"?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>By the time you spoke all those things, you would make them believe that you were talking to the mermaid?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK, continue from there.
    <br>If the person was very far behind me, I could use my hand and to put it in my nose,
    <br>"Ahhh...
    <br>Professor, why have you come to this place to disturb me?"
    <br>I would say, "My lord, it is because of the problem of this Mr "so and so" - that's why we are here."
    <br>Anayo Umumakwe & Family
    <br>Former Mystical Arts Practitioner
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>"Why have you come to disturb me? Don't you know that I'm wrestling with my children?"
    <br>I would say, "My mother, don't be annoyed. You know that other people I brought the other day,
    <br>they brought goods after. Please, heal them."
    <br>Then I would call the client, "Did you hear what the mermaid was saying?"
    <br>He would say, "Yes".
    <br>"OK. Now, you will be healed."
    <br>I would say, "Mermaid said that you need to bring a goat, this and that, including money, 20, 30 or 40 thousand."
    <br>Everything would be brought into the river.
    <br>When the client goes...
    <br>Sometimes, he would be with the money - we check everything -
    <br>and that money would be thrown inside the water.
    <br>The money that they brought...
    <br>Sometimes, you charged them money, they would bring the money.
    <br>You used to charge your clients some money?
    <br>The mermaid would charge them, "That was what the mermaid said; that I'm..."
    <br>Anayo Umumakwe & Family
    <br>Former Mystical Arts Practitioner
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So, what the mermaid said was what I would tell them,
    <br>but the mermaid did not say anything - you know that I'm the...
    <br>When they brought the money, I would first of all...
    <br>Because I had a place I used to stay and do this work - it was under three mango trees.
    <br>There is a very big shelter.
    <br>I would ask them to buy a white handkerchief.
    <br>When they bought the handkerchief, I would first of all tie his or her own money,
    <br>so that I would know the volume.
    <br>Then, I would enter inside the house and cut paper to the size of that money.
    <br>Then, I would tight it to the size of that money.
    <br>I have a bag that I used - I call it "my magical bag".
    <br>The bag has many "compartments" at the front and back.
    <br>That money would be in one "compartment", and the fake one in another "compartment".
    <br>When we got to the river, I would bring that... because it was already tied -
    <br>he didn't know if it was his money or not.
    <br>When men were looking at it, nobody would not know the difference between the two handkerchiefs?
    <br>No no no, it was a white handkerchief.
    <br>But you would know the one that was containing the real and the other the fake money?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- OK.
    <br>I would bring that fake one and ask the person to turn it around his head,
    <br>and to tell the mermaid to solve his problems.
    <br>The person would throw this thing.
    <br>He would believe that the money has been given to the mermaid.
    <br>Meanwhile, the real money was where?
    <br>It was in my pocket; it was my money now.
    <br>Anayo Umumakwe & Family
    <br>Former Mystical Arts Practitioner
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So, what happened after that?
    <br>Then, we would go home...
    <br>No, before you went home, apart from taking the money, did the mermaid request any other thing
    <br>or did you request any other thing from your clients?
    <br>Sometimes, the clients would bath in the river.
    <br>After some incantations, I would ask the client to bath.
    <br>When he bathed, we would collect the water; he would be using it to bath at home.
    <br>Then we would get back to the temple, the shrine.
    <br>When we got back to the shrine, I would prepare medicines that maybe kills that illness.
    <br>The drugs I know kills that illness - I would prepare and give it to him or her, and she would go with it.
    <br>You mean orthodox medicines?
    <br>Yes, orthodox medicines.
    <br>Not your herbal medicines now?
    <br>At the time, I went to the chemist, I learnt how to sell English drugs.
    <br>Sometimes, if it was an English medicine that would take care of the illness easily,
    <br>I would use the English medicine, but if it was the traditional one, I would give the traditional one.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Had there been a time when people came to you and complained about spiritual attacks
    <br>or poison in their bodies?
    <br>What kind of treatment did you give to them?
    <br>Actually, some people would say there was something moving in their bodies,
    <br>and some people would have swollen legs or hands.
    <br>When they came to me, I would tell them that there was something inside, moving in their body.
    <br>I had a wire and a cutter; I cut small pieces of it,
    <br>depending on the quantity I wanted to bring out of your body.
    <br>Then, I went inside the bush and put it in the leaves there.
    <br>I would just carefully stuff them.
    <br>- Into the leaves?
    <br>- Leaves!
    <br>Then I would ask you to come with me into the bush and bring these leaves out.
    <br>When we got there, I would carefully remove those ones.
    <br>You went to the very tree, where you had inserted those...?
    <br>Yes, exactly.
    <br>Then I collected the leaves and asked you to bring more; you brought more that I would add to the first ones.
    <br>When we got to the temple, I would put water in a bowl, I would move those leaves around your body,
    <br>and eventually squeeze it.
    <br>I would ask you to put your hand and bring out those wires; I would tell you that I removed all of them.
    <br>Then I would give him a medicine for swelling.
    <br>If it was rheumatism, I would give him a medicine for rheumatism.
    <br>If I wanted to give him an English medicine, I would deface it;
    <br>he would not know that it was an English medicine.
    <br>So, you were practising both witch doctor and doctor together?
    <br>Yes, exactly.
    <br>Did you go for any training as a doctor?
    <br>No no no, no formal training; all these things are allusion; they just come naturally.
    <br>Nobody taught me all those things I'm telling you about, now.
    <br>OK. How else did you deceive people, and how else did these things affect your life negatively?
    <br>This thing has...
    <br>I have touched lives of so many people negatively - it distorted my life.
    <br>I'm a human being, I have conscience.
    <br>At the time, the thing started disturbing my conscience.
    <br>I was looking for a way out.
    <br>I even tried to destroy some of the things by myself, but still...
    <br>I came to know this Emmanuel TV, and I saw...
    <br>OK, before you talk about how you came about to know Emmanuel TV,
    <br>tell us what happened when you made these charms for people, or these medicines you gave to them,
    <br>and they didn't work, and they came back to you.
    <br>How did you handle it?
    <br>Well, I would change it to another form.
    <br>Some of them made problem and went; they just talked because they were afraid of me.
    <br>So, even when it didn't work for them, they were afraid to come and confront you sometimes?
    <br>Sometimes they confronted me but they would go; they would not do anything because...
    <br>Don't you know what it means to take somebody to the river and bring out the mermaid?
    <br>They believed that I was a small god, they didn't...
    <br>OK.
    <br>So, how did you come about Emmanuel TV?
    <br>It was my son; they came home and told me, "Daddy, there is a channel.
    <br>There is a man of God who is doing wonders. He is healing people.
    <br>Please, put this in our house so we could watch it."
    <br>We bought this "myTV" which is "strong" and we installed it in our house.
    <br>We started watching it.
    <br>Then my faith started...
    <br>I started regretting some of the things I did.
    <br>I saw the man of God delivering so many people; even people who were more powerful,
    <br>who did the real thing, who were more powerful than me, and they were delivered.
    <br>You mean witch doctors, like yourself, and those stronger and more powerful than you?
    <br>More powerful; like that Iguedo - something like that.
    <br>The day he came, he quenched the light, which I cannot do, and he was delivered.
    <br>I said, "I will come to this place to get delivered".
    <br>I continued watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>From there, I made up my mind to come to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Last Sunday, I came with a friend to this place, and the man of God located me.
    <br>When the prophecy was given, I said, "How did this man know that I was in this place?
    <br>How am I going to come out? Many of my clients will see me, that I'm a witch doctor."
    <br>What did you hear the man of God said to you?
    <br>The man of God said, "There is a man here".
    <br>He was pointing at my direction.
    <br>"There is a man here; he is a witch doctor. You need to be delivered. Come out."
    <br>I didn't know how to come out; it was when we were standing up.
    <br>Eventually, my leg started moving like this...
    <br>I was shaking like this.
    <br>Eventually, when I put my left leg, then this one followed; I came out.
    <br>Anayo Umumakwe & Family
    <br>Former Mystical Arts Practitioner
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Amen.
    <br>You mean when the man of God gave that message of prophecy that there was a witch doctor here
    <br>and he should come out, before you were disgraced.
    <br>You knew the prophecy was speaking directly to you?
    <br>The prophecy hit my heart, as if there was a blow - boom in my heart, here.
    <br>I said, "How did this man know that I was inside that church today?"
    <br>I felt I was going to be disgraced.
    <br>I said, "After all, this is an opportunity I've been looking for, for a very long time. Go out!"
    <br>Then, my leg started doing like this...
    <br>Who was pushing you?
    <br>I don't know - nobody!
    <br>So, just like this - my leg started doing like this.
    <br>I managed to step forward with my left leg.
    <br>When I stepped out with the left leg, the right one followed - I started coming out.
    <br>That was how you found yourself at the front of the altar?
    <br>Yes, yes, yes.
    <br>When the man of God prayed for you to deliver you, tell us - what was your experience.
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me that evening...
    <br>You know, I was a chain smoker; I smoked cigarettes, I could spend 1000 Naira on Indian hemp - it was nothing.
    <br>Even in my hotel room, where I was staying, I was smoking.
    <br>The moment the man of God prayed for me...
    <br>He hit my head; it looked as if something went out of my body.
    <br>He hit my chest; in the place he hit me here, it pained me as if it was a bullet.
    <br>It continued to pain me until I went to my hotel room to sleep.
    <br>When I woke up in the morning, I found out that there was no urge; I had forgotten the taste of smoking,
    <br>I didn't know how it used to be in my body.
    <br>Since then till now, I don't smoke any more.
    <br>Anayo Umumakwe & Family
    <br>Former Mystical Arts Practitioner
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>All those tricks and knowledge you had about witch doctor's job, do you still remember all those things?
    <br>I'm no more interested.
    <br>Your mind is not even going there any more?
    <br>Even in the church here, now; some of my clients were calling me; so I switched off my phone.
    <br>They were complaining of one problem or another.
    <br>You mean that at that time when you were doing this job, a lot of people knew you?
    <br>Many people, people came from far away; you know Enugu -
    <br>people came from Port Harcourt, even from Lagos.
    <br>OK, so tell us, as you were practising as a witch doctor, how did this thing affect your family?
    <br>It affected my family adversely.
    <br>Most of the money I got, I used it for drugs, I didn't do anything with it.
    <br>When money was needed, I could not bring it.
    <br>I brought money when I had it, not when it was needed.
    <br>As a family man, you should continue providing every day.
    <br>Sometimes they would ask me and were surprised because of the money that was coming in.
    <br>My wife would be surpised and ask me, "What do you do with this money?"
    <br>I would say, "Why are you asking me what do I do with money? Don't ask me what I do with money.
    <br>I'm using it to keep the family up."
    <br>Another way, in which it affected my life was that people around hated me for nothing.
    <br>Anybody who was sick, they would say I was the person...
    <br>They saw me as a semi-god.
    <br>They said that I was the person who had bewitched that person.
    <br>If somebody died in the vicinity, they would say that I was the person; some even openly.
    <br>So many people are not talking to me now; they said that I was the cause
    <br>of what had happened to their leg, whilst I was not the cause.
    <br>OK.
    <br>So now, you can see that it was the demons that were working with you
    <br>and turning all these things against you.
    <br>Yes, it was the demons.
    <br>I used to see a demon in my dreams sometimes.
    <br>It would be telling me, "You have to wake up. You are not doing this work we assigned to you.
    <br>You don't give us enough animals; we need enough animal blood."
    <br>OK, so you mean that for all these years you practised as a witch doctor, you cannot give account
    <br>of what you have used the money to do; no house, no car, nothing?
    <br>No, no, no; I have used about 2 or 3 cars, but none of them...
    <br>I don't know how...
    <br>Even if the car got spoiled, I would park it and it would just decay - I would sell it as a scrap.
    <br>And today?
    <br>I have one even now, that is parked.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life, for your wonderful deliverance.
    <br>Before we get back to you, to listen to your word of advice,
    <br>we would like to listen to your wife and children - their own side of the story.
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Mrs Rosalyn Umumakwe.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>The two children there are my children.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>The prophecy that the man of God gave my husband last Sunday was 101 percent true;
    <br>my husband was a witch doctor.
    <br>It all started when I entered into a relationship with him.
    <br>Being a novice in all this, I didn't know about it.
    <br>In a short time, I started to see funny, funny things.
    <br>I began to ask him questions about all this.
    <br>He would buy incense of all kinds, different types of scents.
    <br>He would buy different types of coloured candles - big, tiny, small.
    <br>I would ask him, "What is all this?"
    <br>I would tell him that I was afraid of all this, "What do you mean by all this?"
    <br>He would tell me, "Shut up your mouth; I'm praying with all this."
    <br>I would say, "OK".
    <br>A short time after that, the demon pushed him into selling Indian hemp.
    <br>He would smoke as a chain smoker, he would smoke cocaine, he would do all sorts of things,
    <br>he would pick offence at every little thing; he was always annoyed.
    <br>I said, "My God. Is this the type of relationship I have entered?"
    <br>I would console myself.
    <br>One morning, I called him saying, "My husband, come, let us pray."
    <br>He would say, "Don't disturb me."
    <br>It affected us in a very bad way, because some people would come back and tell him,
    <br>"See. What you did for others did not work for us"; 419, selling hemp and other things were part of it.
    <br>Police would come and beat me and my children up, they would steal my money, scatter the house,
    <br>put the house upside down; I would cry.
    <br>They would leave.
    <br>The case continued like that, until one day, I caught his attention and asked him to sit down.
    <br>I told him, "Look in my eyes."
    <br>He looked at me.
    <br>I told him, "If you try this business again, I will leave you and you will go to jail."
    <br>He ran away from that one.
    <br>How do you feel now, that your husband is now delivered, after the prophecy?
    <br>I'm very very happy, I have peace and joy in my heart,
    <br>that God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua has arrested him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>- Amen!

    <br>My name is Master Umumakwe, the man beside me is father.
    <br>The woman beside him is my mother, and that's my younger brother.
    <br>I have two elder brothers but they are not here; they are in school.
    <br>The older one is in Canada doing nursing and nursing sciences.
    <br>The other one is in the university of Nigeria, Nsukka, doing medicine.
    <br>And I will enter this year, by God's grace.
    <br>The prophecy is very correct and accurate.
    <br>You mean you have 2 elder ones; one of them is in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, studying medicine,
    <br>and the other one is in which country?
    <br>Canada.
    <br>Studying what?
    <br>Nursing and nursing sciences.
    <br>And you?
    <br>I'm an aspirant of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, for pharmaceutical science.
    <br>You are also working towards your admission?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You mean, you - the children have very brilliant performance?
    <br>Yes, we have a very brilliant performance.
    <br>Tell us about that.
    <br>You mean that what he was practising did not affect you people?
    <br>No, it didn't affect us in our intelligence, in our family.
    <br>He himself is a very intelligent man.
    <br>I used to see his results from the secondary school; he is a very intelligent man.
    <br>Anayo Umumakwe & Family
    <br>Former Mystical Arts Practitioner
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>When I was born into the family, my father was engaged in this native, witch doctor thing, to be precise.
    <br>He did it day and night, he never departed from it, till last Sunday, when the man of God prophesied to him.
    <br>When I saw some of all this rubbish in his life, I asked him, "What are all these things?"
    <br>He would be like, "I'm working with them".
    <br>He would buy incense of different colours, candles of different shapes and sizes.
    <br>He would see a candle that looks like a fish, I had never seen one like that, and he would buy it.
    <br>He would light it up.
    <br>In the night he would be disturbing us with some incantations that are not real; all of them are fake.
    <br>Sometimes, I would call him as a man, as I've grown up, I would call him, "Leave this thing you are doing.
    <br>All the small small boys would be doing this and you will join them."
    <br>And he is a "rope smoker"; not chain, because chain has some gaps - he was a "rope smoker".
    <br>He didn't even give gaps in smoking, at all.
    <br>He could be smoking Indian hemp with this hand, and be smoking a cigarette with the other hand.
    <br>He smoked day and night, every hour of the day he smoked and he drank.
    <br>He would be drinking and smoking with some of my class mates - boys.
    <br>If I met them, I would beat them very well, and he would be smoking with them.
    <br>When I came to school, I could not even talk in the class; if I talked, they would say, "Shut up.
    <br>Your father is a smoker, he is a native doctor."
    <br>I would just melt like an ice-block, I could not talk at all.
    <br>In my family, we are very brilliant people.
    <br>Sometimes, I would come first in my class
    <br>and they would say that my father had prepared a charm for me,
    <br>to be the first person in the class.
    <br>That made me...
    <br>Sometimes, I ran away from the first position; I would miss some exams, miss some quiz,
    <br>I would not come to school on time, so that I would miss some classes,
    <br>so that my results would not be, as they were if I was punctually in the school.
    <br>In that way they would not say that my father had given me any charms to get the first position.
    <br>But normally, if I worked accurately, I would have the first position in my class.
    <br>But I would abstain from some school activities, so that my results would not be as they would have been.
    <br>That made me...
    <br>Sometimes, I have the spirit of anger, I can get angry and beat five boys, when they come to face me.
    <br>When I was young in my family, my father used to smoke Indian hemp, cigarettes and drank strong alcohol.
    <br>The police would come.
    <br>He used to sell it also.
    <br>Police people would come to our house, even from the drugs enforcement agency.
    <br>They would turn everything upside down, steal our money, even my brother's phone,
    <br>and the clipper that my mother bought for us - they stole it.
    <br>In my family we are all boys.
    <br>Sometimes, when they came, they would first of all beat all of us, to make sure we would not attack them.
    <br>One "drug officer" hang me up in the air, when I was about 6 years old;
    <br>he hang me up, about 7 feet above the ground and he left me there.
    <br>I fell down and I broke into pieces; I couldn't even stand up, I broke my hand.
    <br>When I grew up, I told my father, "Leave all those small children's something that you are doing."
    <br>He would tell me not to disturb him, saying that this money that he has been getting from this thing,
    <br>he has been using to train me, ever since I was an embryo in my mother's womb.
    <br>So, I could not even talk because he has been the one training me.
    <br>He would give me Indian hemp to go and sell it; and I would go.
    <br>Sometimes, they would collect Indian hemp from me and they would not give me money.
    <br>If I came back home and the money was not complete, he would beat me also.
    <br>Those whom I was trying to sell Indian hemp to, would also beat me.
    <br>At the age of 4, I started selling Indian hemp.
    <br>Sometimes, I would carry it to a hidden place, made of bamboo sticks with a long bench, inside the bush.
    <br>I would go there, selling Indian hemp, collecting money.
    <br>Sometimes, they would not give me money and beat me up.
    <br>They would collect Indian hemp from me and kick me to go home.
    <br>Sometimes, I would come back home, telling him that they beat me, and collected the hemp from me.
    <br>He would say, "You know those guys that collected the hemp from you. You must go and collect my money.
    <br>If you don't collect this money, don't come back to this house."
    <br>I would go there, sit down and cry.
    <br>Sometimes, somebody would help me, saying, "Come on, my boy; take one coin - go and give to your father,
    <br>since they beat you and collected the..."
    <br>So all this while...
    <br>You mean, as a son, you didn't believe in what your father was practising, as a witch doctor?
    <br>I didn't believe him in any way.
    <br>I didn't even have trust in him.
    <br>What he was doing was totally fake.
    <br>Because I used to work with him sometimes; he would give me medicines.
    <br>Sometimes, he used to treat people and the people would get well, but the sickness would still come back.
    <br>They would come back and be like, "Since this sickness has not gone, return the money",
    <br>and we had used the money by then.
    <br>They would do some... they would fight.
    <br>If they fought, sometimes they would come with police men.
    <br>There is a stream behind our house; all of us are boys, we know how to swim - we run.
    <br>When we reached that river, we would stand there and be waiting for them.
    <br>If they got close enough, we would jump into the water and tell them to come.
    <br>They would be afraid because they didn't know how to swim.
    <br>We would swim in the river very fast, escaping from someone who wanted to collect 15 Naira from us.
    <br>We would swim from there to a very distant place and come out there.
    <br>There we would remove our clothes, stay there until they had dried.
    <br>We would call people to check if the whole place was calm, before we could come back.
    <br>If we didn't make inquiries and come back, the police might be waiting for us in the bush
    <br>or near our vicinity and they would catch us.
    <br>Every time we used to run.
    <br>It has not been easy at all.
    <br>So, there has been trouble here and there.
    <br>Every day; there was no day there wouldn't be trouble.
    <br>If there was no trouble in the house, there was no money for food.
    <br>If there was no money for food, there would be a crisis between him and my mother.
    <br>Or, when there was no money to pay school fees for my brother, I would come to him, telling him about it.
    <br>He would tell me that there was no money.
    <br>I have a bike in my area to use as a taxi; I would go to the construction sites and earn some Nairas.
    <br>I would come back with the earned money and give to him, saying, "Papa, this is money I worked for.
    <br>Must you work as a witch doctor before you get money?
    <br>Leave this witch doctor thing, find something to do".
    <br>He would be like, "If you tell me that thing again!
    <br>It is only satan that can...
    <br>God cannot come and answer him, it is only satan that can separate me and you,
    <br>if you tell me to leave this witch doctor thing again".
    <br>It happened that I used to work as an okada rider (commercial motorcyclist) in my vicinity.
    <br>Sometimes, I would get like 2000 - 2500 Naira a day.
    <br>I worked as a okada rider (commercial motorcyclist) last December.
    <br>I came to him and said, "Papa, my phone is broken and I need to buy another phone.
    <br>I'm doing something in school and I need to be online to know the latest news.
    <br>I need money to buy a new phone."
    <br>He said, "Don't even come closer to me to say it again.
    <br>Just stay like 10 metres away from me and be telling me that thing. Don't even come closer."
    <br>Sometimes, when he had money, he used to give it to me.
    <br>But anytime he didn't have money; if you came to him to ask for money, he would be very aggressive.
    <br>He has always been very aggressive?
    <br>Anytime he didn't have money, he was very aggressive, but if he had money, he would be friendly,
    <br>he would say, "Come and collect 500 Naira, go and relax."
    <br>People in our vicinity used to accuse him wrongly.
    <br>He himself didn't have the power to kill anybody, to make anybody to have a swollen leg,
    <br>or even to do any bad thing to anybody, but with that knowledge that he was a native doctor;
    <br>anything that happened - even if somebody hit his leg on a stone, passing near our house,
    <br>he would say that my father was guilty of it.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God prophesied to your father, and he was eventually delivered.
    <br>How does this make you feel, as a son?
    <br>Last Sunday, I was very happy.
    <br>I was glued to Emmanuel TV last Sunday, because I knew he was there.
    <br>So, you watched the prophecy?
    <br>I watched the prophecy.
    <br>I was watching it live on YouTube.
    <br>I saw when the prophecy was spoken, and I saw him coming out to confirm it.
    <br>I was very happy that he has been arrested, not like he was arrested the other time,
    <br>with hands and feet in handcuffs.
    <br>Now, it was God that arrested him, and this one is the correct arrest.

    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Amen!
    <br>You mean that every now and then, the police would come, arrest him, put handcuffs on his hands and legs,
    <br>but this time around, it was the Holy Spirit that arrested him, and this one is the correct arrest?
    <br>This one is the original arrest; not the one they would carry him and put him inside the boot.
    <br>There is a mark on my hand here.
    <br>The last time they came to arrest him; one "drug officer", he used his gun on my hand,
    <br>because I asked him to take it easy with my father
    <br>because I could not stay there and watch him beating up my father.
    <br>I have this spirit of anger; anytime I see somebody making me angry, I can even... God.
    <br>So, since after your father's deliverance, can you tell us the changes you have noticed in your dad?
    <br>Yes. He was a chain smoker; he doesn't smoke anymore.
    <br>All this incense, candles - we went to the village to capture some of them in the shrine.
    <br>We have destroyed it; we just scattered everything because it was only a structure to deceive people.
    <br>We burned it; all those things that were shown in the clip - we scattered it and threw it away.
    <br>He said that we should leave something for "historical purpose".
    <br>I told him, "This one for historical purpose? Don't worry. Go outside and come back.
    <br>You will know if you still see this thing inside here."

    <br>Is that the shrine?
    <br>Yes, that's the shrine.
    <br>As you can see this thing; I'm the person who burnt it down, but we didn't capture the fire.
    <br>We just captured this one to show an evidence of him being a witch doctor.
    <br>He had a shrine - both at home and abroad.
    <br>This one is at home, and there is another one in Enugu.
    <br>Any place he went to, he would just sit and look for an item, to make a portable, mobile shrine.

    <br>We can see you wearing a red garment.
    <br>What does that symbolize as a witch doctor, and what other colours symbolize?
    <br>You said you had garments of different colours.
    <br>Yes. I have garments of different colours.
    <br>This red you see, that is the one I used for invoking spirits.
    <br>I have blue, white and green.
    <br>I used them for different purposes, as that spirit demanded.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Can we hear from our brother?
    <br>Now, that your father is delivered, and looking at the experience you've passed through,
    <br>and today God Almighty has located and liberated this family;
    <br>what word of advice do you have for people who are listening all over the world?
    <br>My word of advice to youth like me is that they should endeavour to keep calm with their family.
    <br>No matter the situation on the ground, they should endeavour to keep calm, because if I didn't keep calm...
    <br>There was a time I even decided to run away from home because of all this crisis and trouble.
    <br>Every day, there had to be a trouble; even on Sunday, there must be a trouble.
    <br>Either we didn't have money to cook food to eat in our house,
    <br>or there was trouble between him and one of his clients.
    <br>My advice is that you should have patience, keep calm, and endeavour to have patience in your family.
    <br>No matter the situation on the ground, you should keep calm and pray to God.
    <br>I'm not a praying type, I didn't use to follow my mother to pray in the morning,
    <br>but ever since God liberated my family, I have started joining them in prayers, everything.

    <br>How old are you?
    <br>I'm 11 years old.
    <br>11.
    <br>I have something to say about the native doctor.
    <br>About the native doctor: in the night, he would start doing incantations - we would not sleep.
    <br>We would not sleep in the night; he would be doing incantations.
    <br>We would see a candle like a dog; he would tell you that it is a "dog-candle" that he uses to pray with.
    <br>We would see all types of incense, many types of smell.
    <br>Every time the police would come to our house and tie his hands and legs.
    <br>They would throw him into the car like a ball; he would bounce there.
    <br>He did this "orthodox medicine".
    <br>When somebody was sick, he would come to our house and tell my father, "I'm sick. I need you to heal me."
    <br>Maybe the person was having arthritis in the leg.
    <br>My father would bring vitamin C and give to the person to drink.
    <br>The day after that, the person would come back to our house.

    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>Tell us: you mean when your father gave them charms, medicines - some would still come back?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- For what?
    <br>They would come back saying that they were not healed, that the medicine was fake.
    <br>What would happen?
    <br>They would fight with my father.
    <br>Sometimes, they would call the police
    <br>and my father would be negatively accused that his drug was not working.
    <br>How did this lifestyle of your father affect you in school and in the neighbourhood?
    <br>It affected me in the school, because I could not talk in the class.
    <br>If I took the first position, because I was intelligent in my class
    <br>they would say that my father prepared a charm for me and that was why I took the first position.
    <br>Was your father giving any of you charms for school?
    <br>No. When it came to that, this thing did not work.
    <br>It was just to deceive people.
    <br>So, you guys are just naturally intelligent?
    <br>Yes, we are just naturally intelligent.
    <br>His medicine was just to deceive people, that he was a native doctor.
    <br>Sometimes, he would buy a small key and soak it in the paint, and say it is blood...
    <br>He would soak the key in the paint?
    <br>In a red paint.
    <br>And he would make people believe that it was blood?
    <br>Blood.
    <br>He would use a small rope and tie it with the feather of a hen, and would say that it was medicine,
    <br>"Take it, it will protect you."
    <br>When the medicine did not work, the people would come back and say,
    <br>"This medicine you gave me did not work. Why?"
    <br>They would start having problems with my father.
    <br>OK. Your father said there was a time he stopped taking this Indian hemp.
    <br>Was it true that he actually stopped taking Indian hemp at that time?
    <br>I used to see him in the bush, because I normally go to the stream every afternoon.
    <br>I will say this in Igbo.
    <br>I would see flames of smoke.
    <br>{Igbo language}
    <br>OK.
    <br>For the benefit of those of us who cannot understand Igbo language - what does that mean?
    <br>Where they cook a certain food.
    <br>OK.
    <br>So, when you got to the bush, sometimes you would see smoke coming out from somewhere,
    <br>and you would think that it was a bush that was burning?
    <br>Yes. I would go to that place and see my father smoking.
    <br>And it would be your father smoking Indian hemp?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Then, I would ask him, "Why are you smoking? You convinced my mother that you have stopped smoking.
    <br>Why am I seeing you doing this type of act?"
    <br>He would say, "Shut up. If you tell your mother, I will beat you up."
    <br>So, you didn't like this witch doctor thing your father was doing all these years?
    <br>It brought disgrace and shame to our family; we couldn't talk.
    <br>If we talked, they would say, "Shut up. Your father is a native doctor."
    <br>Since your father got delivered last Sunday, what are the changes you have seen,
    <br>and how do you feel as a son?
    <br>The changes I have seen in my father's life; because he was a chain smoker before,
    <br>but now he is not smoking.
    <br>What about the anger?
    <br>He is not having the spirit of anger any more.
    <br>Before, he used to take offence very easily.
    <br>My mother would talk to him, "Why are you smoking?", in a very polite manner
    <br>and my father would pick offence.
    <br>Sometimes, he would beat my mother.
    <br>So now, everything is over; the family is free?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!

    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>We have heard it all.
    <br>So sir, briefly, what advice do you have for people listening to your testimony today?
    <br>Thank God; it is over, you have been liberated, and there are many people who are still in this bondage
    <br>of deceiving people, having been deceived by satan with fake powers of charms, medicines and whatever.
    <br>What advice do you have for such people, who are listening to you now?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My first advice is that people should trust in God.
    <br>Anything demon gives to you is not permanent.
    <br>Demon has power - true, but God's power is more than demon's power.
    <br>People, listen to me: money is not washed or invoked - central bank prints money.
    <br>Anybody who tells you that he will wash money for you, or print money for you is deceiving you.
    <br>Anywhere you hear a strange voice and they tell you that it is the voice of a spirit - it is fallacy and lies.
    <br>Spirits cannot talk; it is a human being that is talking.

    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So people should not allow themselves to be deceived anymore?
    <br>Yes, don't allow yourself to be deceived; it is a fake power.
    <br>And those who are still yielding themselves to demons to use as witch doctors, priests and others;
    <br>what advice you have for them?
    <br>They should think twice before they get into the same problem that I had.
    <br>They should think twice - there is no way there at all.
    <br>Glory be to God in the highest!
    <br>Once again, let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God for everything.
    <br>Now that it is over, you have to turn your life over to Jesus;
    <br>He is your Lord, Saviour, Redeemer; all power belongs to Him.
    <br>Make His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>For those who are delivered by Christ's Word must be ruled by His Word.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to make the Word of God
    <br> the standard for your life, and also for your family.
    <br>We believe that soon you are coming back with the deliverance you have received
    <br>with greater testimonies of open doors and breakthrough in your life and your family, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Mr Anayo Umumakwe.
    <br>I'm from Imo State originally, but I reside in Enugu State.
    <br>This is my humble and supportive wife,
    <br>this is my third son,
    <br>this is my last born.
    <br>The first two children are not here with us.
    <br>On Sunday last week, I was in the service, when the man of God prophesied and located me.
    <br>He said that there was a witch doctor in this place and he should come out.
    <br>The moment he gave that prophecy, something just hit my mind that he was talking to me.
    <br>I was sceptical; I didn't want to come out, but at that moment my two legs started shaking.
    <br>When I moved my left leg, the right one followed it; so I came out.
    <br>That was where my deliverance started.
    <br>Since that Sunday, the man of God has been taking care of me; he gave me money
    <br>to go and bring my family from the East, from Enugu, and I brought them.
    <br>Since then he has been taking care of us - our feeding, our lodging and other logistics.
    <br>I'm very grateful to God; I want to thank Him so much for delivering me from this long-lasting problem.
    <br>I'm very very happy.
    <br>Now, I feel happy and light, I will not go back to it; no condition will take me back to that.
    <br>I will no longer do it.
    <br>I thank Jesus for my deliverance.
    <br>People of God - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The prophecy that the man of God gave to my husband is 100% true.
    <br>I'm happy.
    <br>Since ever he prophesied to him and he was delivered, I'm very very happy.
    <br>He has been a changed man and nothing can drag him to that satanic work again.
    <br>I thank God for his deliverance.
    <br>I thank the man of God for delivering him,
    <br>for humbling himself for God to use him to deliver my husband.
    <br>I'm happy about it.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>My name is Nakwe.
    <br>The woman next to me is my mother, and the man is my father.
    <br>It happened on Sunday, when the man of God gave him a Word of prophecy
    <br>that he was a witch doctor which I confirm to be true.
    <br>I'm happy now that he has been delivered.
    <br>Ever since he was delivered, he hasn't gone back to any of the characters,
    <br>or any of the attributes of a witch doctor again.
    <br>He hasn't been smoking since then, and I thank God for his life.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for delivering my father.
    <br>My name is Master Umumakwe.
    <br>I'm from Imo State.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true; he has been a new man, since he was delivered.
    <br>He has not gone back to the bad life he was living before.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for delivering my father.
    <br>My advice goes especially to my partners, those who do the same business I was doing.
    <br>I want to advise them that there is no route, no light that way.
    <br>There is life, full life in the Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>They should endeavour to have their own deliverance and live according to the Word of God.
    <br>This is my advice to them.
    <br>Then, to people: they should not be eager to get money by all means
    <br>because what one needs is what people will use to dupe you.
    <br>When you are too eager to get anything by all means, that is when you fall into bad people's hands.
    <br>That is my advice.
    <br>Sir, we thank you for that wonderful advice.
    <br>Right now, we would like to present to you a gift from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The man of God would like to give you the sum of 200,000 Naira
    <br>to help you to start a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Also a copy of "The Mirror".
    <br>These are teachings from the man of God to help you to maintain your deliverance.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Thank You, Man of God, for helping me, delivering me and supporting me - I thank you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Sir, we want to encourage you that as you start a new life in Christ Jesus,
    <br>stay far away from your past, stay far away from sin
    <br>so that you can maintain this wonderful blessing, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God. God bless you.
    <br>May God continue to strengthen you - from strength to strength,
    <br>more anointing upon anointing, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
