    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If there is any stranger - right now, begin to cast it out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Cast it out!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Don't contact my husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I've wedded with the man and we have two boys.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You said what?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I wedded with him in the water.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I'm not going to chase you - just talk; you wedded with who?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You are trying to separate me and that man.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>- Which man?
    <br>- The man I wedded with.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>- Where?
    <br>- He's in the water.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>- He's in the water?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And you want me to separate from the man so that I will give birth for this one.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I refuse; I will not give birth for that one.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I want you to see what is happening in the world today.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>All that you are seeing - this world is not your own.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Talk; you said what?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You want to make me give birth for that man now? No!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Which man?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The husband in the house.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Where is the husband in the house?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>At Lokoja.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Which man are you wedded with?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The one in the water I wedded with - you want to separate me and him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How many children do you have from him?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Two healthy boys.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And you want to separate me and him?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Who wants to separate you?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Man of God, you want to separate me and my husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He put a crown on my head and dressed me in a wedding gown.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Where is your husband now?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The one I love is in the water.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>- The one you love is in the water?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>- The one you hate is where?
    <br>- He's in Lokoja.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can A PASTOR Be POSSESSED?!?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That one in Lokoja - I refused to give birth for him for 17 years now - no children.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Why?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We have agreed that I should not give birth for him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But if I separate you now?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I love that man.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You love who?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The one in the water.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If I separate you, what will happen?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is why you have come.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I can see that God is in you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can A PASTOR Be POSSESSED?!?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Okay, can you move here?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Please.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Please what?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I can't come near you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Why?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I can't come near you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you don't come near me, I will come near you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can A PASTOR Be POSSESSED?!?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can A PASTOR Be POSSESSED?!?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You are delivered today.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Go right now and have a child for your rightful man, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can A PASTOR Be POSSESSED?!?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You see, they have destroyed her life a lot.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Please, I didn't know I was causing suffering to the man in the physical.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I think these are the lessons you are taking home.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You said what?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I didn't know I was causing suffering to my husband in the physical.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>- You never knew?
    <br>- No, I didn't know.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He was taking me everywhere.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He was taking you everywhere for deliverance?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That place - I knew they couldn't deliver me; I just followed him to that place.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She is crying.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I now realise that dream that brought me here.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She is regretting now, that she has been married for many years with no child,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>but she has two children for this man.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It was when I dreamt that they showed me this house.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Come here.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, you have now realised that you caused suffering to your husband?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I didn't know I was causing suffering to him at that time.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You never knew, but now you have realised?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I now realise.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can you still understand what you were saying before, that you had one man in the river?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes. He's gone.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He escorted me to Lagos; he said they should not screen me that day.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When they were about to screen me to register me for the prayer line, he said we should go out.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, when they were arranging people for prayer, you disappeared?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I did not want it, so they wouldn't separate me from that husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You never believed that you can be delivered?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When I called my husband, he said he dreamt about The SCOAN and saw the children of The SCOAN.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It was open wide and everybody was running inside.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He said if I didn't go for the screening, I should not come back home.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>- Your husband said that?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You were normal before but what later came upon you when we were praying, and you began to talk?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When the prayer was going on, the man said I had better go and surrender
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>because after the prayer, he would no longer come to me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How many of us 'wine and dine' with Jesus?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We worship Him in the natural, not in the Spirit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is why you need to depend on what people say about God, what you read about God only,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>what the situation around looks like.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because you worship Him in the natural.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hardly anyone here can explain.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"What is happening? What am I looking at? I don't understand it."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"I am only seeing a woman coming out to talk."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Take notice of the word, 'separation' - this is why you are here today.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can A PASTOR Be POSSESSED?!?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is why everyone is here today - to separate you from poverty, from darkness, from affliction,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>from sickness, from setback, from barrenness, from failure.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Many are here at the point of breakthrough.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You will see them and they will say, "He has made it!"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But just at the point of breakthrough, the thing will just drop - it is too frustrating.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If the whole thing dropped at the beginning, one can reason, "They are not making it".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But after you have beaten many people and are at that point of breakthrough - when many hopes are on you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>many have invested in you, many are supporting you, many are looking at you as their hope... [it drops]
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>By the grace of God, I am Pastor Ruth Ajimi Ojoka.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The name of my ministry is Battle Evangelism Movement.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Last Sunday when the man of God was praying, I felt that touch of God in me and I came out,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>confessing that I was married to a spiritual husband that was in the water.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I had two boys for this man and each time I wanted to make love with him,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>he used to put the mattress on the river and we would be there, making love.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After making love with this man, I would not have affection for my physical husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There are great lessons to learn; listen to what she is saying.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Listen to her statements, very 'professional'.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Even from the way she presents the message you will know in the natural it is a pastor.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But in the spirit she is not. Let's listen.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was praying for people, delivering them and seeing visions
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>while the evil spirit was still operating in me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In the evil spirit operation, I went to prisons and hospitals to pray for people
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and sometimes I would take soap to the prisons to bless people.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I had the spiritual husband operating inside me and when I saw that
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>it was not affecting my life as I was praying for people,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>my life was in question and I ran to a greater authority for deliverance.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Man of God, I want you to talk to my husband because this spiritual husband
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>has dealt with me in my family.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It rendered my husband a poor person.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Each time the money came, one sickness or the other would come and the money would go that way.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was not ready to make love with him at the time he wanted.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was so much in love with the spiritual husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This thing affected me so much, man of God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is why I ran to the greater authority for deliverance.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There was a time in my life that I got pregnant and started attending antenatal classes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The scan said that there was a baby inside of me but all of a sudden, the baby disappeared.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My spiritual husband removed the baby and replaced it with a crab.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I underwent an operation for N200,000 to bring out the crab from inside of me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>They gave it to my husband and asked him to take it to Abuja.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You mean physically, the thing was real?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>At the Federal Medical Centre in Abuja, the crab was brought out and it was alive.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My husband was confused; he had no money to further the tests so he decided to burn the crab.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Man of God, I have run to a greater authority, a greater anointing...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The question, which people don't understand:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have a demon in you and at the same time you minister the Word of God, you pray for people.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What can you say about this? Can anybody there answer? No.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Outside there, how many who you know are like this, but you don't know it?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This is to show you that a man may confess, "I'm a pastor" and not be such in heart.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Anyone can minister the Word of God in the natural but not everyone can do so in the Spirit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can you give us your message in the past - those messages you normally preached in the past -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>so that these people will know that really you are a pastor, in the natural?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It is a great privilege given to me today to be at this great altar.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You see, you listen to that, "a great privilege".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In the journey of Paul to Rome, on the island of Malta, a poisonous snake was fastening to the hand of Paul
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and Paul shook off the beast.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Today, our portion is to shake off every beast in my life, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You listen to that; when I came out, did I speak like that? She speaks better than me!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She is laughing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You listen to that.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When I came out, did I take you to Rome?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This morning, I title my message, "Jesus' name is preached in which authority?"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In which authority are you preaching the name of Jesus?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Is it in the authority of God, or in the authority of a demon?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let us look at Isaiah 49 from verse 24 to 26.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The Bible says, "Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But this saith the Lord, 'Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered.' "
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I know everything that is of God in you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And satan has positioned himself a mighty man over your life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The Word of God says today, that mighty man shall be taken away
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and that good thing of God shall be delivered unto you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am asking, "In which authority are you preaching the name of Jesus?"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>For 17 years, I was calling the name of Jesus - I am using myself as a case study -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was calling the name of Jesus, and the name of Jesus I was calling, praying for people,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>did not affect my life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There was a question: How is it that this Jesus did not affect my life?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was calling the name of Jesus for people, praying for them and giving them visions -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>it became a question in my life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let us look at the Bible again, Philippians 2 from verse 9 to 10.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God Himself has exalted the name of Jesus Christ highly above every other name.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And He said all things in heaven, things in earth and things under the earth
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>shall bow down to the glory of God the Father,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>that at the name of Jesus every knee must bow and every tongue must confess.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I realise and I know for sure under this great anointing that if you are preaching the name of Jesus
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and it is not in God's authority, no demon will bow down for you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can A PASTOR Be POSSESSED?!?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Okay, thank you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, let's call your husband out.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you give her 24 hours, she will preach a powerful sermon and you'll begin to cry.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But who is she?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But today, she is free.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In the past - we could not allow her to talk before she was delivered.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Man of God, this problem of a spiritual husband was the reason my husband was so tired
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and he even sent me to a Bible School but I couldn't be delivered there.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He sent you to where?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He sent me to a Bible School where I spent a year.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>For deliverance?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So that I would be delivered from the spiritual husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can A PASTOR Be POSSESSED?!?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You can see; this man is her saviour.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If not for this man, I don't know who would have housed you until now.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He bore many things; God wanted to use him to deliver you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because I know your coming here is as a result of the pressure this man gave you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>that you must be here for deliverance; he wanted you to be delivered.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This is to tell you that marriage is not only to have children, but for companionship.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My name is John Ojoka from Kogi state.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am a retired police officer, DSP [Deputy Superintendent of Police] by rank.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This woman is my wife.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We have been married for a long time, over 17 years,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>but I never knew that she was possessed with an evil spirit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Each time she fell sick, I always took her to hospital.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She rendered me useless and poor.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I went everywhere, even to churches and other places.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because of her behaviour and the lack of peace in the house,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I decided to send her to a Bible School where she would go and learn more about God
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>so that she would be born again and we would have a peaceful home.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But all this proved abortive.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After the Bible School, if I called her to make love with me, she would say that she is reading her Bible.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She could start from 12am and continue reading the Bible, praying and crying until 4am.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She would not have time to come to me on the bed.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Even while she was doing all of this, I never knew she had an evil spirit in her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Everything that I put my hand on proved abortive.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Everything I did ended in failure, to the extent that I became poor.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I had gone to hospitals where I had spent over 200,000 naira just for an operation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She underwent an operation; the operation failed.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We kept on trusting God that He would surely deliver her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Eventually, God did it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Finally, I want the man of God to deliver me from all evil powers in her
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>so that I can have my peace in the house.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank you, man of God. Help me!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have listened to our father.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If this marriage will not continue, I will let our father know,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and if it will continue, I will let our father know.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But one thing I want you to know: if this marriage would not continue, I would not have invited you here.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I invited you here because I see that this woman still has a big role to play in your house.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She is still the woman I am seeing in your home.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What happened has happened to bring you close, to tie the home.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So that is why I invited you; I want to join your family so that our father can receive deliverance as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>They can live together, I want to counsel them, I want to be part of their family.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She is your wife.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And I want to thank you too.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The Bible says if you honour a prophet, you will receive a prophet's reward.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank you for honouring me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>
