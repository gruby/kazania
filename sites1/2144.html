    <br>President John Pombe Magufuli
    <br>October 29, 1959 - March 17, 2021
    <br>On March 17, 2021 President John Pombe Magufuli
    <br>- the 5th President of Tanzania -
    <br>was called home to eternal glory.
    <br>Alongside his family and nation, Tanzania,
    <br>we at Emmanuel TV and The SCOAN
    <br>celebrate the life and legacy of President Magufuli.
    <br>No doubt, heaven is our resting place
    <br>- our final abode - and we long to be there.
    <br>Therefore, the best prayer we can offer our friends, family and loved ones
    <br>is that the Lord Jesus Christ may be with their spirits
    <br>to satisfy and save them
    <br>and to receive them to Himself at last.
    <br>To the departed soul we say, "Shalom!"
