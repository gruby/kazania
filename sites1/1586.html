    <br>The Living Water Service
    <br>Receiving The Living Water On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>JESUS APPEARS TO SKEPTIC IN TB JOSHUA'S CHURCH!!! ðŸ˜²
    <br>Look at Jesus there!
    <br>See Him standing there!
    <br>The light is too much; I can't even look.
    <br>Your problems are over.
    <br>He said, "I am here to meet your need."
    <br>"I am the Living Water," that's what He said.
    <br>Jesus the Son of God
    <br>I believe in You
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>What are you people doing here?
    <br>Madam, how are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>What's your name?
    <br>Tega.
    <br>You are coming from where?
    <br>I'm from Lagos.
    <br>I saw a shining light.
    <br>Somebody was standing there.
    <br>Just there; it was very bright.
    <br>I could not look.
    <br>The light was entering my eyes.
    <br>I saw a Man in a white robe with smoke.
    <br>There was smoke everywhere from His feet.
    <br>The Person was ascending and stayed there.
    <br>Are you still seeing...?
    <br>I'm not seeing anyone.
    <br>Everything is clear now.
    <br>I heard, "I am the Living Water. Anyone who comes to Me will never thirst again."
    <br>That was when I said, "Jesus, I believe in You. I know You are the Son of God."
    <br>The glory was too much; I could not even look.
    <br>I was hearing the message; I was hearing the voice
    <br>but I couldn't look - it was too much.
    <br>Have you ever seen such thing before?
    <br>No.
    <br>We thank God for the grace you have received,
    <br>to see what any other eye could not see
    <br>and I believe this will bring a radical transformation in your spiritual life.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus for showing Yourself to me.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Chelsea Oghene Tega from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>I came to get the Water for my elder brother - he is not feeling well.
    <br>First of all; I criticized this place a lot.
    <br>I watch Emmanuel TV, I see things happening but I didn't believe them at all.
    <br>When my brother was not well I called my cousin here in Lagos.
    <br>She said I should come to Synagogue because she could not come herself
    <br>and I should come and take the Water for my brother.
    <br>I said, "No".
    <br>One of the friends encouraged me to come.
    <br>I was going to one of the markets, passing along the church.
    <br>So I just said to myself, "They said I should come - let me come, let me just stop."
    <br>I saw a crowd outside.
    <br>I decided to come in.
    <br>When I got in, we sat down.
    <br>They have us cups when we were coming.
    <br>I almost got discouraged - not to even come in.
    <br>I don't know what happened - I found myself inside the church.
    <br>As soon as I got the water, I felt a force holding my legs - I couldn't move.
    <br>All around became "blank".
    <br>It was cloudy, as if it was to rain.
    <br>I just stood and I was watching.
    <br>I saw some things coming out like diamonds; they were glittering, sparkling.
    <br>I was holding my Water...
    <br>Then I saw a Man coming out with smoke.
    <br>It was too "smoky".
    <br>He was just rising, growing big.
    <br>Then, those people I saw at the beginning bowed down - they were worshiping,
    <br>they were doing like this...
    <br>They were demonstrating...
    <br>These were the first people I saw.
    <br>But when I saw that bigger figure...
    <br>I don't know...
    <br>What I saw - I don't know how to explain it; it is beyond human comprehension.
    <br>It is indescribable.
    <br>I can't really explain it but I know what I saw.
    <br>I'm just trying to make you understand how it happened.
    <br>To my own understanding everything happened in under one or two minutes.
    <br>After the whole thing, I started to receive calls that I shut the whole church for about twenty minutes;
    <br>people were waiting...
    <br>I didn't see anybody around.
    <br>They said people were around - I was surprised.
    <br>So, at the time you saw that vision, you did not see any human being, except that...
    <br>I didn't see anybody at all.
    <br>I just saw myself and everything...
    <br>When that Man came, He was making statements, He was talking,
    <br>"Do you now believe?"
    <br>Sharing Experience From The SCOAN Altar
    <br>There was a force that held my legs, for me to see...
    <br>Within seconds, the whole thing, everything disappeared
    <br>but the message was very clear.
    <br>Everything I saw I remembered.
    <br>Within seconds - I did not see anything again.
    <br>I have my own problems but I didn't want to come here for any solution.
    <br>I did not.
    <br>I didn't want to come; I just believed that if I came, it would not work...
    <br>I was just having doubts, doubts, doubts.
    <br>But my cousin was really pressing me that I must come.
    <br>Since I was in Lagos, I could take the Water, go back and give it to my brother.
    <br>It would not be good for me to be in Lagos and leave without coming here.
    <br>I just kept having some minor, little belief, but I was not sure.
    <br>I just wanted to enter and see.
    <br>This Synagogue I've been watching on TV - let me enter inside and see what is happening.
    <br>And you saw what was happening...
    <br>Sharing Experience From The SCOAN Altar
    <br>Indeed, I saw what was happening.
    <br>What happened to me was serious.
    <br>When those things came, there was a force.
    <br>That Man I saw that day was the most handsome man I have ever seen - very handsome.
    <br>It was not just a robe; it was like regalia, crown - everything was glittering.
    <br>I saw sparks coming out.
    <br>The ones that were dancing came forth, like opening the way for Him to come.
    <br>When He came, they all fell to His feet; they were doing like this...
    <br>I was seeing things like diamonds, gold - it was too bright.
    <br>Things were sparkling everywhere, but I didn't see them on the ground.
    <br>The Man did like this.
    <br>I saw "Do you now believe?"
    <br>I had to try to stop the light - light was coming too much.
    <br>It just opened up; something like an inscription - it was very bold.
    <br>Then I saw a question mark - it was bigger than the inscription.
    <br>Tell us once again what you saw written on the chest.
    <br>"Do you now believe?" - then there was a question mark - it was big,
    <br>but "Do you now believe" was smaller, inside.
    <br>That question mark was bigger than the inscription.
    <br>Then I hear, "I am the Living Water" - it was said twice.
    <br>"Anyone who comes to Me will never thirst again."
    <br>Wow!
    <br>God is here.
    <br>Sharing Experience From The SCOAN Altar
    <br>God is in this place,
    <br>because what I saw that day were not just angels.
    <br>Jesus came Himself.
    <br>Sharing Experience From The SCOAN Altar
    <br>He was here - I saw Him, He showed Himself to me.
    <br>I will trust and believe in Him.
    <br>I don't believe in churches, prayers and all that.
    <br>I don't believe they work - you must go to the hospital and spend money on drugs.
    <br>All they would do is to tell you to pay tithes, bring offerings, so I got upset with them.
    <br>It was too much.
    <br>That same Friday, when I went to sleep, there was another encounter.
    <br>It was twice, but this time it was in a form of a sword.
    <br>The sword was pure gold.
    <br>Golden sword was just coming from my wall in the place I slept, little by little.
    <br>I was lying down, I wasn't sleeping - it was a trans.
    <br>The thing just captured me.
    <br>I said, "I'm seeing something on the wall."
    <br>It started rolling; as it was rolling, it was getting bigger.
    <br>Later it started fading away.
    <br>I said, "What is all this? Why am I seeing all these things?"
    <br>Everything just left - there was no message.
    <br>Can you tell us how much this experience has impacted your life, belief?
    <br>The world wants to know.
    <br>I think, right now I'm the number one fan of...
    <br>let me just use "belief" first, then "SCOAN".
    <br>Everything I've been watching is true, real, but I doubted.
    <br>God had to manifest Himself to me; because Jesus is God - He is.
    <br>What I saw that day was too powerful.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>At this point in time, you need no one to preach to you anymore,
    <br>or tell you anything about Christ or His anointed, or His church.
    <br>The revelation you had is enough.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will give you the grace to appreciate this wonderful privilege
    <br>you have received and also testify of His goodness anywhere you go
    <br>and His blessings will continue to locate you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
