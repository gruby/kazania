  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>Are you fine?
    <br>If you are fine, say, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Lift your hands and bless the Lord for His goodness and mercy in your life.
    <br>What a God we have to worship! What a Son we have to praise! What a future lies before us!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You may be seated in His presence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am not sure if you are aware of what is on our official Facebook page.
    <br>There is a message for you from my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He says you should get ready for the shower of blessing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you have not seen it, you need to go and check it.
    <br>It's a prophetic word.
    <br>Get ready for the shower of rain that will wipe away every fear of the unknown.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Remember, fear is a more deceptive enemy than satan.
    <br>Maybe let me say it this way:
    <br>Fear is the new lion in town,
    <br>if you know what I'm talking about.
    <br>What am I talking about?
    <br>A simple cough...
    <br>I feel like sneezing now but I'm afraid.
    <br>I don't want you to go and quarantine me or disappear.
    <br>Before you know it, people start running out of the windows.
    <br>Fear is the new lion in town.
    <br>A simple cough has been tagged 'an affliction'.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In a sober reflective mood, let us remember the prophetic message
    <br>that my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua, gave to us last year.
    <br>He said that last year would be a fearful year.
    <br>We are not talking about a case whereby maybe there is no food on the table
    <br>or money in the pocket.
    <br>You can see the reality of what he said, the reality of the prophecy he gave.
    <br>Everyone is afraid.
    <br>People are not leaving their homes anymore.
    <br>A very fearful year.
    <br>But you know he said that that fearful year will end in March.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know God Almighty reveals to redeem.
    <br>He said it will end in March.
    <br>What month are we now?
    <br>[March!]
    <br>What month?
    <br>[March!]
    <br>Before we go to the message, it's very important for us to listen to that prophecy once again.
    <br>As you listen, be in a reflective mood.
    <br>Listen carefully to the words of our father in the Lord as he gave this prophecy to us last year.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>PROPHECY! PROPHECY! PROPHECY!
    <br>WHEN GOD'S SERVANT SPEAKS FORTH
    <br>THE WISE LISTEN
    <br>DEUTERONOMY 18:22
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua spent the beginning of the year at the prayer mountain.
    <br>Let us listen to what he said about this year, 2019.
    <br>I am here to know the mind of God
    <br>concerning this fearful year, 2019 - very, very fearful.
    <br>I am here to know the mind of God concerning this fearful year
    <br>and also to pray for you and the world at large.
    <br>That is why I am here.
    <br>PROPHECY FOR 2020
    <br>PROPHET TB JOSHUA
    <br>Remember last year what God said through us, that the year was very, very fearful.
    <br>That was last year.
    <br>It was just a summary I was telling you people but I was not giving you the details
    <br>but you are able to see that indeed the last year was very very what?
    <br>That last year is still... it will end around March, by God's timetable.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are walking with God's timetable so every fear should be wiped away from our hearts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This reflects on the message I have today.
    <br>Most times in our lives, because of fear - fear of sickness, fear of death, fear of insecurity -
    <br>when we pray, we expect God to supernaturally crown all our prayers
    <br>with all His glory and success that will make us the centre of our world.
    <br>But when this doesn't happen, we become unhappy with ourselves,
    <br>forgetting that God is love.
    <br>And if we do not do all things through love, we go nowhere with Him
    <br>because faith works by love.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is a thing of the heart.
    <br>So, whatever your heart is telling you right now, that is what you are.
    <br>In this season of fear, whatever your heart is telling you as a Christian, that is what you are.
    <br>People may call us Christians because that is what we confess
    <br>but only God knows the heart of every man.
    <br>Whatever you feel you are enjoying right now, ask yourself these questions:
    <br>Do I have peace of heart?
    <br>Second question:
    <br>How long will all I am enjoying last?
    <br>The peace of heart is the peace of conscience;
    <br>it is our inheritance from the Lord.
    <br>And we obtain this peace of conscience by walking with the Lord.
    <br>When we walk with the Lord, it will produce eternal joy, assurance of life, ease of heart
    <br>and security of God's presence.
    <br>In these fearful times, thank God for the prophetic message of our father in the Lord.
    <br>As a Christian, peace of conscience will rescue you.
    <br>You must walk with the Lord, and when you walk with the Lord,
    <br>whatever your heart is telling you in this season - that is what you are.
    <br>Are you a Christian controlled by fear?
    <br>When the Bible says that the peace of conscience we derive from walking with the Lord,
    <br>which we inherit from Him, produces eternal joy, assurance of life, ease of heart,
    <br>most importantly - security of God's presence.
    <br>It therefore means that the level of peace you have will determine the level of your success,
    <br>will determine the level of your blessing.
    <br>Ask yourself: Am I living with peace of heart?
    <br>Am I living with peace of conscience?
    <br>If you are not living with peace of conscience, it is time to begin to look into your love walk.
    <br>It is time to look deeply into your love walk.
    <br>... which will lead me to the message today:
    <br>LOOK INTO YOUR LOVE WALK
    <br>Tell somebody, "Look into your love walk."
    <br>Let's take our proof text from the Book of Matthew 18:7.
    <br>Actually we have two proof texts;
    <br>first proof text - Matthew 18:7, second proof text - Romans 14:20.
    <br>Matthew 18:7 - and it says:
    <br>"Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble!
    <br>Such things must come, but woe to the person through whom they come!"
    <br>Let's look at Romans 14 from verse 20 but we can start from 19.
    <br>I think it's more explanatory.
    <br>It says:
    <br>"Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.
    <br>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food.
    <br>All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person
    <br>to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
    <br>It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else
    <br>that will cause your brother or sister to fall."
    <br>Those are powerful words.
    <br>Do you agree with me that they are powerful words.
    <br>For the sake of food, do not destroy the work of God
    <br>and do not do what will cause another person to sin or to stumble.
    <br>Do you know that many of us have suppressed our faith by failing to walk in love?
    <br>My father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua says that help is the best investment
    <br>and that by adopting a lifestyle that is on purpose,
    <br>you provide an opportunity to enrich others,
    <br>leaving your imprint in a positive way.
    <br>This means that positive examples are tremendous motivators for success,
    <br>just as negative examples are motivators for failure.
    <br>How many of us in life have encountered a good Samaritan, a God-sent person
    <br>at a crucial moment in your life?
    <br>How many of us - a lot of us, I believe - have encountered a God-sent person,
    <br>a good Samaritan at a crucial moment in our lives,
    <br>who was willing to share his love, time effort, talent, experience, knowledge
    <br>and all the Lord had given him or her just to build you so that you could grow?
    <br>The person could be your neighbour, pastor, employer, teacher, parents -
    <br>either your mum or your dad.
    <br>It may have been a one-on-one tutoring, a once-off tutoring, a regular tutoring,
    <br>but the bonus was...
    <br>Ask me: What was the bonus?
    <br>I can't hear you. 
    <br>[What was the bonus?]
    <br>Again.
    <br>[What was the bonus?]
    <br>The bonus was you never paid for those services.
    <br>But my question now is:
    <br>How or why did that relationship end?
    <br>Reflect back in your life - people who have been the good Samaritan in your life,
    <br>that came at the crucial moment when you needed that help so dearly, so severely -
    <br>they came at that time in your life.
    <br>They shared their talent, experience, knowledge, everything they had - just to build you.
    <br>What happened to that relationship?
    <br>Did they share all that love with you only to be repaid with hate?
    <br>They made you who you are today but now you see them as nothing.
    <br>They exhibited or showcased your beauty to the world
    <br>but now all you do is exhibit their ugliness.
    <br>They shared everything they had with you at your demand with a smile.
    <br>But now, you frown at their slightest request.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What happened to those relationships?
    <br>How and why did it end?
    <br>This is why the world is the way it is and we are the way we are.
    <br>I want to show you an example of what I'm saying.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the earth and it is rotating.
    <br>Am I right?
    <br>It's doing what?
    <br>I cant' hear you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The earth is rotating.
    <br>This is why we are the way we are and the world is the way it is.
    <br>My question remains: Can we say because the world is rotating, evolving, changing,
    <br>that is why we are also rotating, evolving, changing?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As the world rotates, we also rotate.
    <br>Maybe ignorantly but we do rotate.
    <br>I will tell you why and how I discovered that.
    <br>You may say, "Oh, but the earth is moving; I don't rotate. I walk normally. I live normally."
    <br>Yes, we do rotate.
    <br>Every stage of our lives is a rotation.
    <br>If I ask you:
    <br>How many of you can identify how your primary school teacher looks like?
    <br>You will not remember anything.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At every stage of our lives, everything becomes a backlog.
    <br>How many of you can remember your best friend in nursery school?
    <br>How many?
    <br>Nobody!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If your teacher walks past you on the street, you will not remember him or her.
    <br>But that person will remember you because he or she has planted a blessing into your life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where are all our first experiences of life?
    <br>Where are they?
    <br>Your best friend in nursery school, your favourite high school teacher,
    <br>your first business partner that you started together with or the family that trained you,
    <br>brought you out from the miry clay and trained you
    <br>and you became what you are today.
    <br>Where are they?
    <br>Ask yourself this question.
    <br>If you ask many influential people today, they will tell you that their first ladies
    <br>are not necessarily their first wives.
    <br>I mean, today, we are always eager to discover new friends,
    <br>we want to make new business partners, new relationships, new neighbours.
    <br>Everything new!
    <br>The word 'newness' just affects everything about us.
    <br>It is not a crime to have new things but where are the ones we made earlier in life?
    <br>Why is that relationship not being maintained?
    <br>Today, many people find reasons to hate, to lie, to be insincere,
    <br>because people are out there to encourage them to do so.
    <br>But hardly will you find anyone that will encourage you to love, to be sincere,
    <br>that will encourage you to be truthful, honest.
    <br>We are getting to the stage of decadence, people of God.
    <br>On social media today you will see that anybody can merge two pictures together
    <br>and claim another man's property, car, wife,
    <br>even claim another man's family by merging pictures.
    <br>This is technology.
    <br>And the funniest thing is people will believe it without verifying the truth.
    <br>Do you agree with me?
    <br>We forget times when we had a photo album and we pasted to remember
    <br>all the special memories of our lives.
    <br>But today, anybody can paste another person's picture, family, and claim it is theirs.
    <br>And people will begin to commit suicide, get depressed because of what they see.
    <br>Many youths today are killing, stealing and destroying
    <br>because they want to meet up with that trend, that life of 'make-believe.'
    <br>Many other youths are depressed and suicidal
    <br>because they feel their parents are not meeting up
    <br>or matching up to standards of what they see.
    <br>Originality has disappeared.
    <br>Man-made things are now being more over-emphasised compared to the things of God.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>Ask yourself, "Where are we going?"
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that sincerity is one of the greatest tools that will help you and I
    <br>achieve good success, not just success.
    <br>Anybody can achieve success but good success - the one that comes from Christ.
    <br>Pretence is the disease that is holding many down today.
    <br>But sincerity is one of the greatest tools that will help you and I achieve good success.
    <br>In one of my father in the Lord's visits to the elderly people,
    <br>he came back to explain the story to us.
    <br>He said he discovered that most of those elderly people
    <br>that had been abandoned by their families
    <br>without love and care for one reason or the other,
    <br>he discovered that most of them were related to some very influential people in society.
    <br>And to make matters worse, people are now pushing to classify ageing as a disease,
    <br>claiming that it will facilitate their healthcare needs,
    <br>claiming that it will help them to be able to get good medical care
    <br>if ageing is classified as a disease.
    <br>If this happens it will not only enhance the negative image the more,
    <br>it will affect their moral status in society today
    <br>and it will then cause many families to abandon them the more.
    <br>By creating the forum for the needy, the elderly, the less privileged, the widows, the orphans,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has not stopped soliciting that the elderly need to be cared for,
    <br>because it is not a crime to be old; it is the grace of God.
    <br>We need to see giving to the poor, to the widows, the orphans, the less privileged
    <br>as an assignment from God.
    <br>Though the love and care you show to them are not enough to bring you and I to salvation
    <br>but they form the basis of judging your level.
    <br>Now the basis of judging our level begins from our heart.
    <br>Because the heart is the great thing the Lord looks at and requires.
    <br>The heart makes up the content of a man's character.
    <br>Man may do much by outward restraint
    <br>but still lack the character of God in his resolution.
    <br>This is why many of us - we are very hard-working, devoted, dedicated -
    <br>whatever we want to do, we are focused on that -
    <br>but we cannot give account of what we achieved.
    <br>That is outward restraint.
    <br>You see countries helping each other to face their challenges
    <br>and in the process they also are challenged because of outward restraint.
    <br>We may do much by outward restraint but lack the character of God in our resolution.
    <br>In 2 Samuel 15, Absalom, David's son, believed he could use his friendliness, his charm,
    <br>his concern for justice as political strategies to win the hearts of the Israelites
    <br>and overthrow his father, David.
    <br>The Bible says he would sit at the city gates where all the international visitors,
    <br>the foreigners would come into the city and he would listen
    <br>to the complaints of the people, listen to their concerns.
    <br>And the people began to look at him and say, "Maybe this is our king.
    <br>Maybe we should ask his father to step down so that he can take over."
    <br>He was doing all that by outward restraint.
    <br>Anxiety about tomorrow, I mean being anxious about tomorrow,
    <br>is the cause of killing, stealing and destruction.
    <br>Anxiety about tomorrow is also one of the factors that cause imitation.
    <br>Imitation has caused many to begin to run a race they cannot finish with their destiny.
    <br>They forget that there is no competition in destiny.
    <br>When I say, "running a race they cannot finish"...
    <br>Mister "A" is the lawyer, doctor, contractor, pastor,
    <br>but there is nothing he can achieve among everything.
    <br>They continue to run a race they cannot finish with their destiny.
    <br>Imitation has caused many men of God, people in the Kingdom business,
    <br>to begin to seek shortcuts to spiritual maturity.
    <br>Imitation has caused many to begin to use the tools of guesswork
    <br>and imagination as claims that they can hear from God.
    <br>When I say 'guesswork', I mean imagination.
    <br>They have the belief that they can hear God with their ears and not their hearts.
    <br>They can stand and do this.
    <br>"Yes, Lord. I can hear you, Lord.
    <br>Speak, Lord. Your servant is listening.
    <br>Oh Lord, God of heaven and earth, I can hear you. You said what? Oh yes, Lord!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God does not speak to our ears; He speaks to our hearts,
    <br>because our heart is the communication point.
    <br>That is why it is the greatest thing the Lord requires.
    <br>You can imitate the Word of God to be a pastor but you cannot imitate the Spirit of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You cannot imitate the Spirit of God because without the Spirit of God,
    <br>doing such acts - works of deliverance and healing - are indeed a risk.
    <br>When I look at my brother now and I stretch my hand and I say, "Be healed, in Jesus' name!" -
    <br>yes, the word goes forth but where is the Spirit?
    <br>Because it is the Spirit that will back the word.
    <br>If I say, "Let there be light, in Jesus' name!",
    <br>the word will go forth but where is the Spirit, which is the result?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why we need to reflect deeply because everything that is happening around us
    <br>has become a life of make-believe.
    <br>Because the principle of deliverance states, if you cannot deliver me, I must deliver you.
    <br>You find a pastor today delivering people physically, but spiritually he is being delivered.
    <br>Spiritually, the chains that he is loosing in the lives of the people are being bound around him.
    <br>We are still talking about looking into your love walk.
    <br>As a Christian, the first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual lives.
    <br>It is very important.
    <br>If we are successful, wealthy, making it, famous, and our spiritual lives are not prospering,
    <br>it will soon fade.
    <br>I mean, it will start facing greater challenges.
    <br>And as it fades, so also will the life upon which it is bestowed.
    <br>If the success is failing, if the wealth is diminishing,
    <br>so also will the life upon which it is bestowed.
    <br>Most times, self-will around our hearts does not allow us to meditate
    <br>because we are not ready to pay the price for value.
    <br>That is why you can see a Christian...
    <br>If they say, "Something is happening today!
    <br>There is something there!"...
    <br>Self-will around our hearts does not allow meditation.
    <br>That is why we can believe anything or anyone,
    <br>when the Word of God encourages us to examine all things in the light of God's Word.
    <br>If your wealth is prospering but your spiritual life is not prospering, it will soon fade.
    <br>When it begins to fade, fear of sickness will come.
    <br>The fear of insecurity...
    <br>When I say 'fear of sickness', then you begin to remember that you need to do a medical check-up
    <br>every month, every week.
    <br>When you have a slight headache, you say, "Oh, where is the doctor?"
    <br>Like what is happening today - fear of sickness.
    <br>Where is the security of God's presence as a Christian?
    <br>We must remain steady in an unsteady world.
    <br>As the level of your success grows, you begin to look for something new,
    <br>you move from one place to the other.
    <br>Fear of insecurity.
    <br>Some of us can have a thousand bodyguards for no reason at all.
    <br>Where is the security of God's presence?
    <br>Where is our peace of conscience?
    <br>We need to begin to look into our love walk.
    <br>I will give you one fascinating story that touched my heart,
    <br>when I arrived at The SCOAN.
    <br>I remember when the first international visitors were coming to the SCOAN,
    <br>we thought Prophet T.B. Joshua would by then say,
    <br>"We are going to receive the first foreigners in our church.
    <br>We need to relocate our church to Banana Island, or Lekki or V.I.
    <br>so that we can meet up with the status of the people coming."
    <br>He didn't do that.
    <br>He obeyed the voice of God
    <br>because God always chooses to place us where it pleases Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He didn't relocate the church, he remained here
    <br>because he had an assignment from God to improve the lives of people in this community.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This community of Ikotun Egbe - what a difficult word to pronounce.
    <br>Am I right?
    <br>If you ask an Ibo man to pronounce 'Ikotun Egbe'...
    <br>But I think if I asked any Nigerian to pronounce this word, they would still be able to do that.
    <br>I want one of our international visitors from Europe, Asia, outside Africa
    <br>to come and pronounce this word for me, please.
    <br>If you could that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's see if you can pronounce this word.
    <br>Ikotun Egbe.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Well, I will give you a pass-mark.
    <br>I want somebody who is coming here for the first time.
    <br>Can you please pronounce it?
    <br>Ikotun Egbe.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ikotun Egbe.
    <br>This is what I'm talking about.
    <br>Ikotun Egbe.
    <br>Such a difficult word to pronounce.
    <br>But you know this difficult word, coming from this uncivilised community here
    <br>is now globally known on the world map
    <br>because of Prophet T.B. Joshua's obedience to God.
    <br>Anything you enjoy or have, whatever you have and generations now
    <br>and those yet unborn cannot enjoy - it is not history, it is story.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Story says:
    <br>Once upon a time - that is story.
    <br>But history states, "This is where it was, this is where it is and this is where it shall be."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Reflect on your own life.
    <br>Whatever you feel you have that cannot be enjoyed by generations now
    <br>and those yet unborn,
    <br>whatever you have that cannot be enjoyed by the first experiences,
    <br>but you want to enjoy it with the new experiences, it is a story;
    <br>it is not history, because story says, "Once upon a time."
    <br>But history says, "So it was, so it is and so it shall be."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You raise me up
    <br>So I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up
    <br>To walk on stormy seas
    <br>I am strong
    <br>When I am on Your shoulders
    <br>You raise me up
    <br>To more than I can be
    <br>You raise me up
    <br>So I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up
    <br>To walk on stormy seas
    <br>I am strong
    <br>When I am on Your shoulders
    <br>You raise me up
    <br>To more than I can be
    <br>Oh, such a blessed song.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let the weak rest on your shoulders.
    <br>Let the needy rest on your shoulders.
    <br>Let the poor rest on your shoulders.
    <br>That is going to be one of the greatest achievements you will make in life.
    <br>Don't look for those whom you will give and they will come and tell you, "Thank you, sir."
    <br>But give those whom you may never meet till the end of your life.
    <br>Love without expectation.
    <br>That is what God requires.
    <br>Two things define a man:
    <br>The patience he exhibits when he has nothing
    <br>and the attitude he shows when he has everything.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Watch me.
    <br>Are you seeing me?
    <br>The patience he has when he has nothing
    <br>and the attitude he exhibits when he has everything.
    <br>New walk, new smile, new laugh.
    <br>How many of us are still residing in our old neighbourhood?
    <br>How many of us?
    <br>How many of us are still connected to our former neighbours?
    <br>We are coming closer home now.
    <br>God has blessed us, we are wealthy, our lives have improved.
    <br>How many of us are still connected to our former neighbours?
    <br>I will tell you a story of mister "A", let me cover his name - mister "A".
    <br>Mister "A" became wealthy
    <br>and left his former neighbourhood.
    <br>But the surprising thing is: Anytime he is passing by that street of that neighbourhood,
    <br>he would tell the driver, "Move quickly. I need to get to my appointment."
    <br>The driver would keep wondering, "Why is mister 'A' always in a hurry when we are passing
    <br>through this neighbourhood?"
    <br>Even when he is sleeping, the moment his senses tell him he is in that neighbourhood,
    <br>he would start barking at the driver, "We need to go."
    <br>By the time he gets out of that neighbourhood, he would say, "Slow down. Let's take it easy."
    <br>Mister "A", when he forcefully has to go there, maybe for one reason or the other,
    <br>he will keep making empty promises to his former neighbours.
    <br>- "Oh, mister "A", you are welcome. We have been looking for you.
    <br>Since you've got your new position, it has been so difficult to see you.
    <br>I just wanted to find out if you could help my son, he needs some scholarship."
    <br>- "Don't worry. Tell him to see me in my office. Give him my phone number. He should call me.
    <br>Tell him to come to my house, he will see me there."
    <br>That day will never come.
    <br>He will keep making empty promises.
    <br>When the so-called person now visits his office or his house,
    <br>before he gets to the gate, the security will tell,
    <br>"Oh, sorry. Mister "A" has gone to Europe. He just left." or "He has gone to Asia."
    <br>- When is he going to be back?"
    <br>- "Oh, I'm so sorry. He didn't even say when he would be back."
    <br>Meanwhile, mister "A" is sitting upstairs in his bedroom.
    <br>Why do we keep running away with our wealth, with our blessing?
    <br>Even when mister "A" needs to give forcefully,
    <br>he will give with his hand but his heart will be full of complaint.
    <br>This is the same thing the Lord is looking at -
    <br>the heart - it is the greatest thing that He wants.
    <br>Mr "A" will give with his hand
    <br>but his heart will be full of complaint.
    <br>Ask me: What will the heart say?
    <br>I can't hear you - what will the heart say?
    <br>The heart will say, "Money, money, money. All they do is to ask me for money.
    <br>They don't know anything else but money."
    <br>Ask yourself, "Who owns the money?"
    <br>I'm asking myself, "Who owns the money?"
    <br>Who owns me?
    <br>Say, "Who owns the money?"
    <br>Who owns me?
    <br>My father in the Lord says we can never do enough to obtain God's favour.
    <br>We can never do enough to obtain God's mercy or God's blessing.
    <br>You can keep running away, like mister "A", with your wealth, success, influence.
    <br>In fact, if you could put all your property in a bag and keep dragging it everywhere you go,
    <br>you can do so,
    <br>but you cannot run away with peace of heart because it belongs to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our focus on materialism today has diverted our devotion from God to the god of wealth,
    <br>the god of success, the god of talent and skill.
    <br>We forget that many founders of ministries that stood the test of time
    <br>may not have been knowledgeable people.
    <br>They may have been rustic, ignorant, non-eloquent people
    <br>but they relied on the Holy Spirit for every decision.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is happening to us that have taken it up today?
    <br>What is happening to those ministries that stood the test of time years back?
    <br>Everything keeps diminishing in our hands -
    <br>not in number, not in numerical strength but in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It keeps diminishing because we are busy looking for outward qualities -
    <br>those who can make the highest contribution, those who can build one of the branches,
    <br>those who can speak eloquently or possess one skill or talent.
    <br>Automatically, they take up the position of pastorship without query, without question,
    <br>without consulting the Spirit of God.
    <br>It is like somebody who is working in a company -
    <br>you are employed to work and you are employing people without the owner's consent.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have turned the House of God into an auction house for the highest bidder.
    <br>- 10,000 Naira.
    <br>- 20,000 Dollars.
    <br>- 30,500.
    <br>- 40,000 Dollars.
    <br>That is what we are doing in the House of God.
    <br>The Kingdom business has become business as usual.
    <br>There is no difference between a company and the church.
    <br>The owner of the company will try to ensure that his son studies the courses
    <br>that the company requires so that he or she can take over when they retire,
    <br>rather than looking for God-sent people,
    <br>whom God has put the interest of the company in their hearts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take the case of Prophet Samuel -
    <br>when God sent him to go and look at the sons of Jesse
    <br>and anoint somebody that would be king of Israel.
    <br>Prophet Samuel looked on the outside - that is Prophet Samuel,
    <br>somebody who was highly anointed.
    <br>But Prophet Samuel saw Eliab, one of the sons of Jesse, and said,
    <br>"This person must be the one. The appearance, oh my God!
    <br>Look at the stature. Look at everything."
    <br>What did God say?
    <br>"This one you are looking at, this person you see has been rejected."
    <br>The person we keep following, and we say,
    <br>"Oh, this person had made this or this for the church" as if they have bargained with God
    <br>to get what they want.
    <br>We put them where they are not supposed to be.
    <br>Meanwhile, God is saying, "This person has been rejected"
    <br>and you keep giving, blessing or receiving - you are receiving a curse.
    <br>Examine all things in the light of God's Word.
    <br>It is because we have failed to walk in love, that is why our faith has been suppressed.
    <br>That is why we lose sense of judgement.
    <br>Tell me how the love of God can work in the heart of a man who only thinks of himself?
    <br>Tell me how the power of God can be entrusted to one who is busy looking at outward qualities?
    <br>He cannot be given that power to heal or to deliver.
    <br>He will only work through imagination and guesswork.
    <br>Hear the Words of Jesus:
    <br>In Mark 2:17, Jesus said,
    <br>"I have not come to call the righteous; I have come to call the unrighteous."
    <br>In other words, we are not called to call the rich necessarily
    <br>but those who need what we have to give.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are called to call the poor, the needy, the orphans, the widows,
    <br>the motherless, the fatherless.
    <br>Bringing my message to a conclusion:
    <br>When you get home, read 1 Corinthians 13:13.
    <br>When we don't seem to hear or receive from God,
    <br>the first place we are to look into is our love walk.
    <br>Remember, everyone hurts somewhere and those mistakes stay on their mind.
    <br>Maybe your ignorant speech has hurt somebody deeply.
    <br>Those mistakes stay on their mind.
    <br>Your mistakes stay on your mind.
    <br>Their mistakes stay on their mind.
    <br>That is why you need to first of all forgive yourself and forgive others.
    <br>If you don't forgive yourself, you cannot forgive others.
    <br>The only way you can forgive yourself is to reflect on where you are coming from,
    <br>where you are now and where you are going.
    <br>The same God that said, "Do not hit your neighbour, do not slap your neighbour"
    <br>also said, "Do not kill."
    <br>If you hit your neighbour unjustly, it is the same thing as killing him.
    <br>Whatever you do or you fail to do to your neighbour, that you do unto God.
    <br>Remember, somebody has invested their time, their loyalty, their effort so that you can grow.
    <br>You need to retrace your steps.
    <br>Forgive yourself, then you can receive forgiveness.
    <br>Just as you have dedicated a crucial moment in the life of someone,
    <br>somebody else has dedicated or devoted a crucial moment in their life for your sake.
    <br>Reflect on where you are coming from, where you are now and where you are going.
    <br>Look around and find out those who need your sincere love, those who need your care.
    <br>Somebody is waiting for you for a lifetime.
    <br>Remember that forgiveness is a bridge to the future.
    <br>Begin to resemble God in every grace, in His pardoning goodness, in His love.
    <br>Let this Christ-like attitude influence your actions from now on
    <br>and be the principle by which you act and the end at which we all aim.
    <br>What is the end we aim?
    <br>The Kingdom of God.
    <br>Let love be uppermost in your heart.
    <br>I bless you with this word and I pray that as this word has blessed my heart,
    <br>it has blessed your heart also, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Lord Jesus, we thank You for Your Word.
    <br>Father Lord, give us the grace, love enough to spend more on others and less on ourselves.
    <br>Father Lord, influence our decisions with love.
    <br>Influence our actions with love.
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray!
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>God bless you!
