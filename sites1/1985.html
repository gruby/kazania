    <br>Can you hold this message tight?
    <br>He has given me faith to believe.
    <br>You mean you are set free?
    <br>Yes, God has given me faith to believe.
    <br>The father of the demon-possessed boy ran to Jesus, "Help my unbelief!"
    <br>He gave faith to the man to believe.
    <br>He ran to Jesus, "Help my unbelief!"
    <br>Jesus looked at him and gave him faith to believe.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer.
    <br>On your own? No. It is faith in faith.
    <br>You continue to compare what happened to you yesterday, three days ago, where you were coming from -
    <br>unless God gives you faith.
    <br>But I can see and I sense that grace, that God has given you faith to believe.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God has given me faith to believe".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Viewers at home,
    <br>viewers all over the world,
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>you also.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Right now, pray for your nation.
    <br>Pray for your nation, your country -
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>Open your lips: 
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>Prayer.
