  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you for your time.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Once you do things at God's time, you have the best.
    <br>At God's time, everything looks good.
    <br>GOD'S TIME IS THE BEST!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Each time I do things at God's time, I don't look around for the words to say and what to do.
    <br>They are always around me - what to say, what to do, how to do them, at God's time;
    <br>He provides them.
    <br>It is when we are not doing things at God's time, we begin to wrestle, looking for our own words -
    <br>what to say, what to do and where to go.
    <br>We begin to use our discretion,
    <br>thinking, "What will I say? How will I say them? Where will I go? How will I go?".
    <br>When we are not doing things at God's time, when we do things at our own time,
    <br>it is always for us -  the thinking, the reasoning - everything is always very rough.
    <br>Whatever you do at God's time, you will find them effortless.
    <br>But when you do things at your own time, it will require your energy, ability, effort, tension,
    <br>pressure, which will result in sickness, disease, heart attack because you are the one doing them.
    <br>You become so tired.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>When you sleep at God's time, you have wonderful dreams, not nightmares.
    <br>It is when you do things at God's time, trust can work.
    <br>You put your trust in Him according to His will.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>Put your trust in Him according to His will.
    <br>Put your trust in Him according to His promise.
    <br>Put your trust in Him according to His time.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>GOD'S TIME IS THE BEST!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Trust is of no use without His time, without His promise, without His will.
    <br>"I trust Him". Ok.
    <br>To do what you are doing, are you doing that thing at His time?
    <br>Faith is not real without His time.
    <br>Faith is not real without His promise.
    <br>Faith is not real without His will.
    <br>"I have faith" - that faith must be in Him - His time, His will and His way.
    <br>Let someone say: Faith is not real without His will.
    <br>Faith is not real without His promise.
    <br>Faith is not real without His time.
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>You cannot separate God from His will.
    <br>You cannot separate God from His promises.
    <br>You cannot separate God from His time.
    <br>Therefore, faith is in His time, promise and His will.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>In this case, it is like many Christians are trapped.
    <br>They don't know the God they are serving
    <br>because faith is not real without God's will.
    <br>You must know His will and have faith in Him.
    <br>Faith is not real...
    <br>Remember, the will of God is the same thing as the promise of God.
    <br>His time too.
    <br>You must do things at His time for Him to follow you,
    <br>for Him to be with you, for Him to protect you, for Him to listen to you, for Him to be with you.
    <br>"At His time, I trust Him" - this means that you trust His time.
    <br>You put your trust in His time, in His will, in His promises.
    <br>The faith bracelets - the one you have with you - where is your own?
    <br>Ok, come and see the gentleman here.
    <br>Show them.
    <br>Oh my God! What are you saying?
    <br>Take more of me; give me more of You.
    <br>I want to believe all what you have been seeing since morning - the testimony of people
    <br>and the will of God we have been seeing,
    <br>the promises of God we have been seeing.
    <br>All this happened because it happened at God's time.
    <br>They are promises of God; they are the will of God.
    <br>We have been looking at them - what a wonderful blessing!
    <br>These are the things you are meditating on.
    <br>I told you that the Word becomes a part of us by meditation.
    <br>The Word of God becomes a part of me by meditation.
    <br>That is the only way -  not by thinking.
    <br>I told you about thinking.
    <br>When it comes to the Word of God, you cannot think about the Word of God but your situation.
    <br>Because meditation is of the upper house and thinking is of the lower house.
    <br>When you are thinking, you are still in this realm: you are still with us here.
    <br>But when you are meditating, you are not in our midst here.
    <br>Meditation is of the heart - it is of our spirit.
    <br>For your heart to act upon the Word
    <br>- I mean, heart means your spirit. That is, man's spirit.
    <br>For your heart to act upon the Word, you must meditate on the Word
    <br>and turn it over and over again in your heart.
    <br>That is the only way the Word can dominate your heart.
    <br>When the Word dominates your heart, it influences your conduct and character.
    <br>You begin to behave that way.
    <br>The Word of God says, "Be faithful", and you start seeing yourself being faithful.
    <br>It influences your conduct.
    <br>You that complain about deliverance - "I don't want to smoke again" - meditate on the Word.
    <br>Before you know it, the Word of God says, "No". You will begin to behave that way.
    <br>That is self-deliverance.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When the Word dominates your heart, not your mouth ...
    <br>When the Word dominates your heart ... Heart means man's spirit.
    <br>When the Word dominates your spirit, it influences your conduct and character.
    <br>Don't forget that meditation is a visit with God.
    <br>Say to yourself:
    <br>Don't forget that meditation is a visit with God.
    <br>Meditation in the Word is a visit with God.
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[Meditation in the Word is a visit with God.]
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you, sir.
    <br>You have been struggling to follow the Word of God.
    <br>By meditation, the Word becomes part of you.
    <br>It is not by knowing the Word of God.
    <br>You will know and you will preach it and teach it - simple.
    <br>There are many teachers and preachers of the Word, but the Word is not part of them.
    <br>That you know the Word does not mean it is part of you.
    <br>It is only when the Word becomes part of you that you can live the Word.
    <br>You live it; you live the Word.
    <br>The Word can only rule you when it dominates you.
    <br>The plan for success - keep the Word, meditate day and night and do what the Word says.
    <br>Without meditating day and night, you cannot keep the Word.
    <br>It is when you keep the Word, the Word can influence your conduct and character.
    <br>When you meditate day and night, the Word will influence your conduct immediately,
    <br>that is your behaviour - you just begin, "No! This not the will of God. This is not what God says".
    <br>But with nothing to influence your conduct, you will do whatever you want to do
    <br>because the Word has not influenced your conduct.
    <br>The Word becomes a part of you by meditation.
    <br>The Word of God becomes a part of me by meditation.
    <br>By the way, what is the Word of God?
    <br>The Word of God, a Spirit, creates material things.
    <br>This shows that the Spirit is greater than material things and you are one of the material things.
    <br>The Word of God (a Spirit) creates material things.
    <br>This shows that the Spirit is greater than material things because He created them.
    <br>The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.]
    <br>But today you are rich, you have money, you have big houses,
    <br>you have a fleet of cars, you have a lot of money, you are a professor,
    <br>but your spiritual life is zero.
    <br>You can't even relate with God.
    <br>You don't even know God's opinion about yourself, talk less of others.
    <br>That will show you are zero spiritually,
    <br>and a Spirit creates material things.
    <br>And you are fighting for material things all your life.
    <br>You are working for material things, fighting for material things and you abandon the Creator - a Spirit.
    <br>This is why our life is like this.
    <br>When you prosper in other areas, prosperity becomes a burden.
    <br>You know, when you are very fat and that fatness will begin to affect your legs.
    <br>You will now begin to complain.
    <br>You will not be able to walk.
    <br>All these are prosperity, while the leg is Spirit.
    <br>The leg is what? Spirit.
    <br>All these parts are material things.
    <br>All these parts are what? Material things.
    <br>The two legs? The Spirit.
    <br>That is a good example of what we are talking about in this world.
    <br>And the Spirit is the One that created the body.
    <br>The prosperity is so much for Him, and He is now complaining that He cannot move you again.
    <br>He will not be able to move you - there is a burden. This is a crisis.
    <br>The Word of God, which I have asked you to meditate on day and night, has to relate with God, visit with God.
    <br>By meditation, the Word becomes part of you.
    <br>The plan for success if you want to succeed in life.
    <br>The Word of God (a Spirit) creates material things.
    <br>Wealth, fame, popularity, whatever you achieve, whatever you can talk of, outside the Spirit - He created them.
    <br>That is to show that the Spirit is greater than everything; He is the greatest.
    <br>But these are the things we are chasing after in the world today; killing ourselves for.
    <br>Dining and wining - there is nothing we cannot do to get them.
    <br>And many of us we have enough of them. Now they have become a burden again.
    <br>By the time you have them, you start complaining again because the Spirit is less.
    <br>People are looking for money, fame, popularity.
    <br>When they now become famous, rich they start complaining again
    <br>because their spiritual life is a zero.
    <br>You are building a foundation on the Spirit.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, if you believe you have got everything -
    <br>you are rich,
    <br>famous, popular all over,
    <br>but your spiritual life is nothing to write home about.
    <br>Yes, begin to share those things with those who are in need so that you will have peace.
    <br>As you share them, God increases your spiritual life.
    <br>Share with others in a Godly manner.
    <br>Share with others.
    <br>God has no hand but your hands to give.
    <br>He has no money but your money to share.
    <br>Share with others in a Godly manner.
    <br>As you share with others, your spiritual life begins to increase.
    <br>Share you time with others,
    <br>your strength with others,
    <br>your wealth with others,
    <br>your wisdom with others.
    <br>Share them with others.
    <br>You are blessed to bless others.
    <br>You are here to receive what your life depends on.
    <br>You also must learn how to give what your life depends on.
    <br>You keep receiving what your life depends on, but you keep giving what you do not need.
    <br>If I am talking to you?
    <br>What you are giving are those things you do not need.
    <br>Those things, when you give, you don't feel them, and giving has to do with sacrifice.
    <br>Any giving that does not go with sacrifice is not giving.
    <br>Look at Abraham.
    <br>You must sacrifice. You must feel it.
    <br>The pain must come. You must feel the pain.
    <br>No matter how rich you are, as you give it you feel it.
    <br>If you don't feel that you are giving something, you are not giving.
    <br>Every true giving must go with sacrifice.
    <br>Until you are able to balance this, then your giving will be rewarded.
    <br>And God is the Rewarder.
    <br>Your giving will be what?
    <br>[Rewarded.]
    <br>Giving is to reshape our destiny.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Giving is to reshape our destiny.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Giving is to reshape our destiny.]
    <br>You are reshaping your destiny.
    <br>So, I want to leave you here.
