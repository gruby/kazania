  <p>    
    <br>How are you? You have ceased menstruation.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>As a result of drugs.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Yes, Man of God. She is on drugs; she takes drugs.
    <br>That is what I am saying. I said, it is as a result of drugs.
    <br>Yes, Man of God. She is addicted to drugs.
    <br>- She is addicted to drugs?
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>This has affected her menstruation and given her chronic headaches.
    <br>Yes, Man of God. It is true. I came with her. She is my daughter's friend.
    <br>Ok. It's alright. Come on.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Get healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>She is free.
    <br>Following her deliverance after the prophecy, the woman's menstruation began to flow
    <br>and she came back the next day to testify.
    <br>Makes Her Way To The Restroom
    <br>Ceased Menstruation Begins To Flow After Prophecy
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Hawa Nakamba.
    <br>I come from Zambia.
    <br>The persons standing beside me are my mother, my auntie and my cousin.
    <br>Last week Sunday when I came, the Prophet prophesied to me that I had ceased menstruation
    <br>due to drugs intake and that I also experienced headaches due to drugs.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be very true.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It all started three years ago when I was addicted to drugs in Zambia.
    <br>I used to take codeine.
    <br>In a day, I could take 5 to 6 bottles of codeine.
    <br>While my friends could only take one or two bottles of codeine, I could take 6 bottles.
    <br>I thank God because the way codeine used to affect me,
    <br>it made me not to be afraid of anyone.
    <br>I used to steal money from my mum just to buy codeine.
    <br>I would threaten her if she didn't give me money.
    <br>"Mum, give me money. I want to go and do something."
    <br>I could even steal from her.
    <br>I thank God. When the Prophet touched me on Sunday, I was delivered and I am free now.
    <br>When the Prophet touched me, I felt something moving (in my body).
    <br>I felt light.
    <br>Briefly tell us the consequences of the drugs you were taking before on your body and your health.
    <br>After taking the drugs, my menstruation seized.
    <br>I did not concentrate or listen to anyone.
    <br>When the Prophet just touched me, when he prayed for me,
    <br>immediately after, my menstruation started to flow.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hawa Nakamba & Family
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My memory also came back. I slept well and I feel light, after the prophet prayed for me.
    <br>I feel very light and I am well now. I am free. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The urge for the drugs, and everthing of that lifestyle has gone?
    <br>It has gone.
    <br>This is what happened after the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>I had not seen my menstruation for so long.
    <br>But immediately after the man of God prayed for me, it started.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>We can see truly that our sister is delivered.
    <br>We saw in that word of prophecy as the man of God spoke to her,
    <br>she was still under the influence of the drugs; she was unable to even compose herself to respond.
    <br>But today, her memory is restored, her menstruation is restored, the addiction to drugs is gone
    <br>and she is here with her family to share this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Sister, what is your advice to people, especially young people all over the world watching you?
    <br>My advice goes to every youth watching me all over the world.
    <br>Stop taking drugs, it is not good.
    <br>Come to God, He can heal you and change your life.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
