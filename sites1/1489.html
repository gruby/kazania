    <br>My name is Mabel Goana and I am from Paraguay. 
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>My problems started when I was a child.
    <br>Since I was born, there were family problems in my home.
    <br>I was sexually abused at the age of five.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>From that moment, my world started falling apart.
    <br>When I was a child, I was sad and depressed.
    <br>I liked the feeling of staying in the dark and being alone.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>During that time, I sought for refuge in darkness and the occult attracted me.
    <br>When I was young, I would seek for information on how to have a relationship with the devil
    <br>and intimacy with him.
    <br>I also acquired knowledge about the occult and witchcraft.
    <br>That was my desire.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>While seeking for the information, I learnt that I could make a covenant with the devil.
    <br>I surrendered totally to him and got more information about the blood covenant.
    <br>I did it on October 31, at midnight.
    <br>I gave my life to satan; I belonged to him.
    <br>I gave him my life and my dreams.
    <br>I told the devil I belonged to him and that he should help me.
    <br>I thought that in him, I would find solution to the emptiness of my heart.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>I made the covenant with him and since then, my life changed.
    <br>That change was supernatural; I began to see things I have never seen before.
    <br>I suddenly began to have knowledge of things I never knew before.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>The devil gave me the knowledge and instructed me how to use it.
    <br>I did not imitate what other witches did; I did things they could not do.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>I started having mental powers; I could move objects that were far from me.
    <br>I could foretell what would happen in other places.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>Every day, I practised witchcraft.
    <br>I used this against people I didn't like; I would curse them.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>Everything looked like a fantasy but did not last up to one year.
    <br>It was like an adventure for me.
    <br>I used to enjoy the things the devil gave me but after that, he began to torment my life.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>I could no longer sleep.
    <br>The devil would disturb and attack me,
    <br>telling me that I belonged to him and should commit suicide.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>My life wasn't normal and every day, I couldn't reason well.
    <br>I thought of killing myself to put an end to the torment.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>I started cutting my veins.
    <br>Every day, I would use different objects to cut myself.
    <br>I tried cutting myself with all my strength but each time I tried, it never got to my vein.
    <br>This infuriated me.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>I also tried different methods like hanging myself but the rope would fall off.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>I also swallowed different kinds of pills so that I could kill myself
    <br>but after a few minutes, I would vomit everything.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>Many times, I tried getting hit by a truck but the truck would stop in front of me.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>The devil never left me.
    <br>The devil said to me, "If you cannot give me your life,
    <br>give me the life of your brother or someone in your family."
    <br>Every day, I would restrain myself from hurting my family because
    <br>I was very aggressive towards them to the extent that I threw a knife at my brother.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>I suffered because of this.
    <br>I had insomnia. If at all I slept, I would have nightmares.
    <br>I would cry every day.
    <br>I would feel someone sit on my stomach and try to strangle me.
    <br>It was like this every day.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>The devil tormented me day and night, telling me to kill myself.
    <br>I tried cutting my veins all day.
    <br>I tried with all my strength - using a knife, cutter, razor, glass or whatever I could get my hands on
    <br>but it couldn't penetrate my veins.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>I found out about the coming of Prophet T.B. Joshua through my church.
    <br>I had been following his ministry through social media and I was impressed.
    <br>My dream was to meet him even if it meant that I had to travel to The SCOAN, Nigeria.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>I remember that when I was at the prayer line, my legs became weak and I almost fell down.
    <br>A voice instructed me to run away from there.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>At that moment, the prophet was walking towards me and I was right in front.
    <br>When he came closer, the atmosphere became so strong and powerful.
    <br>I couldn't resist it because I had never experienced or felt such a thing before.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>When he touched me, my body reacted.
    <br>I felt pain all over my body and began to sweat because many spirits came out of my body.
    <br>Many spirits manifested through me.
    <br>When I got myself, I stood up and I was completely free.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!.
    <br>My word of encouragement is that no matter the situation you are in,
    <br>no matter the muddy pit you are in, if you have faith in God,
    <br>He will come to your rescue.
    <br>"I SOLD My SOUL To SATAN!" 🖤☠️😱| Spine-Chilling Confession!!!
    <br>Now, I can say I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>After the Paraguay Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the news of healing and deliverance spread throughout the country
    <br>and people who were free from the shackles of the devil
    <br>were invited to share their miraculous experiences
    <br>on various TV stations across the country
    <br>to testify to the wonderful works of God in their lives.
    <br>Let's watch some of the interviews.
