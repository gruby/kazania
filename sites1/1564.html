    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>TB Joshua
    <br>QUESTION: We read in the news that a famous pastor recently committed suicide.
    <br>Hours before his passing, he officiated the funeral of someone who also committed suicide
    <br>and days before his death, he wrote this on Twitter:
    <br>“Loving Jesus does not always cure suicidal thoughts.” 
    <br>Man of God, what is your reaction to this?
    <br>ANSWER: Whatever your situation as a believer, a Christian, a pastor,
    <br>it is meant for your obedience to God.
    <br>We grow in character through obedience,
    <br>just as spiritual growth is a function of obedience to God.
    <br>A man may be sick in body or be poor and yet be a Christian, a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>It is important to guard against misjudging ourselves when we are in circumstances
    <br>such as hardship, trials of many kinds, temptation and failure etc.
    <br>The Book of Hebrews 5:8 says though He (Jesus) was a Son,
    <br>yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered
    <br>– name-calling, rejection, slanderous remarks, jeering at Him etc.
    <br>What you are going through now as a believer, a Christian or a pastor
    <br>is for your obedience to God’s will.
    <br>We grow in character through obedience
    <br>Oftentimes, we run from the very things that will bring strength to our lives
    <br>such as trials, temptation, pain of various kinds,
    <br>all of which are meant for our spiritual benefit (2 Corinthians 4:16-18).
    <br>Are you a Christian, a believer, a pastor?
    <br>If you are a Christian, a believer, a pastor, His grace would be sufficient.
    <br>Apostle Paul said he had a thorn in his flesh from the pit of hell.
    <br>That thorn could be cancer; it could be depression.
    <br>We never learned that this killed Paul or caused him to see God in a bad light;
    <br>he continued his ministry,
    <br>It means God manifested His strength in that thorn.
    <br>As Christians, God speaks strength and courage through our troubles,
    <br>as He did with Paul, Stephen and a host of others
    <br>(2 Corinthians 12:10, Acts 7:59-60, Acts 16:16-34, John 16:33, Galatians 2:20).
    <br>The question is: Are you a Christian? Are you a believer? Are you a pastor?
    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
