  <p>    
    <br>I am Pastor Gabriel.
    <br>I have a lot to say but before I go on,
    <br>I would like to say I have maligned the man of God a lot - Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I have preached a lot of messages against the man of God by saying
    <br>that he is the antichrist of our generation.
    <br>The level of my ministry:
    <br>I was the president of Joint Campus Fellowship in Nigeria
    <br>throughout my days in the university - from year one until I graduated.
    <br>I was the president of Joint Campus Fellowship.
    <br>During my service year, I was the president of NCCF.
    <br>And during that time I used to be a guest speaker in Scripture Union.
    <br>Any youth programme they did, I was invited as a guest speaker.
    <br>When the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria
    <br>made it known to us that we should have nothing to do with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and The Synagogue Church Of All Nations, I took it upon myself as a leader of the youths
    <br>to make sure that none of them had anything to do with the man of God.
    <br>Man of God, I don't know how to say this, I am on my knees - I beg that you forgive me!
    <br>I am saying this because I know many people could have received deliverance like I did
    <br>but because of my ministration, many of them might not have received that.
    <br>I have gone far in ministry.
    <br>Through my ministration, a lot of people have been saved
    <br>but coming to this ministry - I fought it with all my strength as a youth.
    <br>I fought it with all my muscles so that nobody would come here,
    <br>but after some time I backslid and became an administrative pastor.
    <br>As an administrative pastor, when I got the message, I could not verify it.
    <br>I didn't know whether it was true or not, but I went ahead to minister the message.
    <br>I preached the message titled 'The antichrist of our generation - Prophet T.B. Joshua.'
    <br>You can imagine when a large crowd has gathered and one preaches such a message -
    <br>'Antichrist of our generation,' starting from Nigeria, while all of us, saints, are here!
    <br>What are we doing?
    <br>That fired up the youth and when I finished the message,
    <br>you can imagine the prayer that was prayed by the crowd.
    <br>We started casting and binding.
    <br>I didn't know where I was going.
    <br>After some time, I graduated as a microbiologist.
    <br>I went back to school for a medical course, which I finished before I got a job
    <br>with the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital as a medical lab scientist.
    <br>That was where I met my wife.
    <br>When I intended to marry her, the very time I proposed to her,
    <br>the microfinance business that was paving the way in Uyo ...
    <br>My workers would say,
    <br>"Director, when we went to the field today,
    <br>people were asking us about the secret of our boss' success -
    <br>how he has been shaking the place."
    <br>Before I knew what was happening, I saw my business going down.
    <br>Now, you cannot even mention the name of the company anymore -
    <br>nobody in Uyo knows the company anymore.
    <br>It has now become silent to the extent that when I mention the name of the company in Uyo,
    <br>some people will say, "I have not heard that name before,"
    <br>whereas this was a company that was on the front line before.
    <br>All this started happening when I proposed to my wife -
    <br>the issue of a snake coming to my bedroom,
    <br>going on top of my suitcase and raising its head as if it wanted to fight with me.
    <br>By the grace of God, with my little boldness,
    <br>knowing that my anointing was no longer there and I was just an administrative pastor -
    <br>I picked a stick, fought with the snake, killed it and burnt it with kerosene.
    <br>There was another one inside the compound as we opened the gate.
    <br>I was with my wife that very day.
    <br>We were even quarrelling because she was considering whether to leave or not.
    <br>When I proposed to marry her, she told me she was AA.
    <br>All of a sudden, when she did another test, her genotype was AS.
    <br>I am also AS, so I told her I couldn't marry her.
    <br>Because of that, we were arguing. Then the snake entered and climbed up my leg.
    <br>I jumped; the snake ran and hid somewhere.
    <br>I told the snake, "You cannot escape,  you must die."
    <br>God helped me and I killed the snake.
    <br>Then the final battle was with a man who appeared to me in my bedroom.
    <br>I was punching the air even though the man was there.
    <br>I got up from my bed in the afternoon and saw a man standing.
    <br>I said, "Where did you come from? How did you enter here?"
    <br>He said, "You must leave that girl. Must you marry that girl?"
    <br>I said, "I will marry her!"
    <br>A confrontation started between me and the man. As I continued punching the air, he disappeared.
    <br>When I decided to take her home for the introduction ceremony -
    <br>to make my family know the person I wanted to marry - on our way to my village, we got lost.
    <br>It took us a lot of hours to find our bearings, after which we continued.
    <br>Close to my place, the vehicle's engine got knocked.
    <br>We parked it by the roadside and got a towing van to take it away.
    <br>Then we found the way to my house.
    <br>My family asked about my vehicle, but I told them I didn't come with it.
    <br>I didn't want to tell them all the stories because if I did, they would be afraid.
    <br>To cut the story short, after that incident, we got married.
    <br>After a lot of battles, we got married.
    <br>When we got married, it seemed as if all the members of staff were asking
    <br>if this was the woman that would be taking the money while they worked.
    <br>No one told me, but it seemed as if that was what was agreed upon.
    <br>If someone stole money from the company today, another person would do the same.
    <br>I kept arresting different guarantors
    <br>and all they said was that they would pay back the money in tiny bits.
    <br>At the end of the day, the money would be gone.
    <br>That was how I kept losing money and my microfinance business was going down.
    <br>I saw myself going down to zero level and I kept running up and down.
    <br>In the course of this, I told myself it was too much. "How will I get power to assist me?"
    <br>I thought that my power, at my level, could not help me anymore.
    <br>My prayer and fasting couldn't help me anymore. I started looking for a man of God to help me.
    <br>I didn't know where to go. Then I remembered that there was a man I preached against
    <br>and whose channel we were told not to watch.
    <br>That is Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>I had a decoder in my house. I used to watch sports, entertainment and news.
    <br>I disconnected Emmanuel TV. I didn't allow anybody to watch it in my home
    <br>and I made it known to them that nobody should watch it in my home.
    <br>In the course of this, I decided to be watching it secretly
    <br>so that I would be able to find out some things before I knew what to do.
    <br>Whenever I wanted to watch Emmanuel TV, I would make sure I locked the door,
    <br>closed the curtains properly, and that no one was around.
    <br>Then I would watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The truth is that I didn't watch it for only one month and it had been a secret act in my home.
    <br>I kept on watching it and I started matching the activities I was seeing with the Scripture.
    <br>I kept asking myself, "Why then did CAN tell us not to watch Emmanuel TV?"
    <br>I was looking for a solution to my problem and I needed a powerful man of God to assist
    <br>and bring me out of the deep pit I saw myself going into.
    <br>When I became convinced, I wondered how I was going to tell my wife about this.
    <br>One day, as I knew she was coming in,
    <br>I tuned to Emmanuel TV and sat to watch it.
    <br>Immediately she entered and heard the prayer going on, she asked me to turn it off.
    <br>Immediately, she took my daughter into the bedroom.
    <br>She said I must stop watching that channel
    <br>and that I was the one who gave the order that no one should watch it.
    <br>I quietly switched off the television.
    <br>I went to the bedroom and said gently, "Sweetheart, calm down.
    <br>I am making some findings; I will tell you about them later."
    <br>She agreed with me.
    <br>I kept telling her about the channel until she agreed to watch it with me.
    <br>Gradually, we started watching it.
    <br>She said, "This is what is happening in our family. This is what we are passing through."
    <br>We realised that whenever she was watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>and the man of God started praying, she would start to shake.
    <br>I realised that something was going on and that I had got to where I was going.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>While this thing was going on, I decided to come to The SCOAN physically,
    <br>to know what was going on there.
    <br>One day, I was meant to go for a business trip to Lagos. Then I took a flight to Lagos.
    <br>I lodged at a hotel.
    <br>I wore a pair of jeans, canvas shoes and a cap, which I turned backwards
    <br>just to be sure that I disguised myself - because many people knew me as a minister.
    <br>I tried as much as possible to make myself look like a yuppie guy.
    <br>I put my hands in my pockets while walking so that if you saw me,
    <br>you would doubt if I was the one.
    <br>I could remember when I entered, I went to the back and sat right at the extreme.
    <br>"Let me monitor what is going on."
    <br>I just came to spy what was going on here.
    <br>I didn't come to participate in anything, but to know what was going on here.
    <br>From the beginning until the end of the service,
    <br>when many people had left, I did not want to go.
    <br>I said, "I will see the end of it today."
    <br>I watched until the end of the deliverance of some people and left.
    <br>I didn't see anything wrong or contradictory to the Scripture. I was like, "What is happening?"
    <br>Another day, I came back.
    <br>The day I came, I didn't disguise myself as the first time but I knew I didn't dress well
    <br>so that you wouldn't easily recognise that this is the important figure you know.
    <br>I still hid myself.
    <br>I came and hid until the service ended. Then I went home.
    <br>Getting home, I told my wife, "What I said about T.B. Joshua is not true.
    <br>That man is a true man of God."
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>Afterwards, I told her, "I think we can go and try that man."
    <br>In the process of coming here, we prepared ourselves.
    <br>To summarise the whole story, we came around November or December last year.
    <br>When we entered here, she jumped up.
    <br>People held her hand but still she jumped uncontrollably. I said, "Eh, okay!"
    <br>At the end of the day, as she was about to go for deliverance,
    <br>she told me she wanted to use the restroom. I told her to go and come back.
    <br>I was standing beside her; I didn't want her to go anywhere,
    <br>but because of her condition, I allowed her to go.
    <br>When she came back, I didn't see the other people who were also to be delivered.
    <br>We started running around; that was how we missed our deliverance that day.
    <br>Yesterday, we came back and at the end of the day she was delivered.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>A point I didn't say is that, when this was happening I was looking for who would help me
    <br>to get my spiritual power back because I had told her that I would deliver her.
    <br>Because of that, I brought my passport here with me.
    <br>I came so that the man of God could pray over my passport.
    <br>I tried to get a man of God that would mentor me and help me get back to where I was
    <br>because I knew I had backslid and was practising religion,
    <br>teaching people about the Bible without power.
    <br>It got to a point I communicated with a man of God outside this country
    <br>whose name I would not like to mention here.
    <br>I communicated with him; he told me to come and he would help me.
    <br>That made me process my papers and I tried to leave the country for it.
    <br>The first day, Ethiopian Airlines disappointed me. I went the second time
    <br>and was also disappointed.
    <br>By December, when I came here,
    <br>I was in the overflow section when the man of God was praying.
    <br>I can still remember when he told me, "Your case is settled."
    <br>I felt he was talking to me. I don't know when I lay down and started crying.
    <br>Look at the testimony coming true.
    <br>The man of God, The Synagogue Church Of All Nations -
    <br>the place I said nobody should go -
    <br>is the same place where I have finally received my deliverance.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>One important thing in life is that many of us men of God
    <br>act by what the news tell us, because the power and the spiritual insight are not there.
    <br>I heard and acted.
    <br>Many men of God are also acting by what they heard. We don't have spiritual insight.
    <br>As I told you, the outreach does not exist anymore because of lack of power
    <br>and I don't like to run a ministry without power.
    <br>Because of that, I stopped.
    <br>I had told people not to go there and to avoid the man
    <br>because I believed that my leaders had done some findings about him.
    <br>They told us not to - and I acted ignorantly, based on that.
    <br>I plead with fellow men of God:
    <br>Let's find out the truth about whatever we want to do before we do it.
    <br>If not for the condemnation and persecution, do you think I would be at this level that I am today?
    <br>What else again?
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>I know the value of my trials.
    <br>The value is so great; they made the whole world know me.
    <br>It is a free advert.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>You can see there is no signpost, no signboard.
    <br>You cannot see any signboard of The Synagogue since the beginning of this church.
    <br>You are my advert. You are my signpost.
    <br>The question people used to ask me: Why not advert? Why not signboard at least in front of The Synagogue here?
    <br>You are supposed to see a big board.
    <br>I will carry my Bible; that should show you.
    <br>I will carry my Bible like this. I will say, "..."
    <br>But, you cannot find it anywhere.
    <br>Even in Lagos Island, everywhere.
    <br>When you are coming, look around. You will not see "The Synagogue Church Of All Nations" signboard.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because God has blessed me with free adverts.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>Look, it takes a spirit of foolishness to hear something without going there and confirming.
    <br>Every genuine human being, a leader, every leader - you may be a leader now, you may be a leader tomorrow -
    <br>either you are still young and God has destined you to be a leader tomorrow.
    <br>Every one that God destines to be a leader,
    <br>when they hear something - it may take time - they will find a way to confirm what they hear.
    <br>In the process of confirmation, they become part of me, and I become part of them.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>This ministry has been around for the past 20 years.
    <br>If there is anyone out there that says he is 'elite',
    <br>a man of wisdom, understanding, and he's still not confirmed - through Emmanuel TV one day -
    <br>it means something is wrong.
    <br>It's true your confirmation now brought you here.
    <br>You were not just here; it was what you heard in the past.
    <br>In the process of confirming your information, you now find yourself; the same thing with our brother here.
    <br>The free advert is so gracious; it is a big blessing to me.
    <br>The free advert brought about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was on Nigerian National Television and local television.
    <br>When the miracle was showing, because of me, your former president said they should remove the miracle.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>And they removed the miracle and they stopped the miracle programme
    <br>on your national television and your local television.
    <br>And the body that guides the television stations in Nigeria brought about a law that
    <br>no 'miracle pastors' should be shown.
    <br>It was because of me; not because of anybody else.
    <br>That brought about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>That brought about what? Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Are you listening to me?
    <br>Let me tell you. Sometimes you say, "One man is not good; that man is not good."
    <br>I pray that he will rest in peace, President Yar'Adua. Whether you like it or not, it is like a President you lost.
    <br>He was a great man.
    <br>I was here on my own without asking this man for honour.
    <br>I received a phone call. He said, "I will give you an honour - OFR." (Order of the Federal Republic).
    <br>This is a man that does not share the same faith with me; he is a Muslim man.
    <br>I received a phone call, "I want to give you an honour."
    <br>I said, "Honour? I am a servant of God. What I am doing is not to receive an honour."
    <br>He said, "No, you deserve this honour."
    <br>I did not go myself to receive this honour and I sent my wife to go and receive the honour.
    <br>Nobody is aware of this because I don't put it in my name.
    <br>When you see 'T.B. Joshua' you will not see 'OFR', because nobody knows.
    <br>I said, "Ok. I am honoured by my nation". I sent my wife to receive the OFR.
    <br>The man did not know what to do to show that 'God is using you', even though he is not a Christian.
    <br>Some time when you are talking, saying "northerner, southerner, easterner", I keep laughing.
    <br>The issue is not 'northerner, easterner', but love. Nigeria is one.
    <br>I am just telling you a man from the northern part of Nigeria was a real Muslim man. Rest in peace, this man.
    <br>We had never met. He had never invited me for prayer.
    <br>But how he got to know and monitored all that had happened.
    <br>He said to me, I could remember,
    <br>that after looking at the number of people coming to this country from each port of entry in Nigeria,
    <br>he realised that I attracted the most foreigners.
    <br>You know, this is the first time you are hearing this from me,
    <br>but you never knew that I have an OFR; I have it.
    <br>It is not the number of years you spend, the nature or kind of death; how you die does not matter.
    <br>"I know the man". When you are looking, talking of those who ... you are saying whatever ...
    <br>You know, God's opinion is different from your opinion.
    <br>The opinion of God about that late President Yar'Adua is different from your opinion.
    <br>Your oil could not attract visitors, but anointing attracts visitors.
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>Why I am saying this is that sometimes when you talk of north, south, Christianity, Muslim -
    <br>Love is the greatest!
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Love is the greatest!
    <br>Say: You talk of north, south, Christianity, a religious man, a Muslim -
    <br>Love is the greatest!
    <br>You keep talking of issues of religion - Christianity and so on - and you forget love.
    <br>Where is love?
    <br>The Bible says, "Love your neighbour as yourself!"
    <br>Your neighbour could be what?
    <br>Your neighbour could be your enemy, a pagan, a religious man, a Muslim.
    <br>The Bible says, "Love your neighbour!"
    <br>Which name do you see here? Is that not Umaru Musa Yar-Adua?
    <br>- Is this man a Christian?
    <br>- No.
    <br>Why did this man recognise what is happening here - this OFR - and he is a Muslim?
    <br>Love is what? The greatest!
    <br>Love is the greatest!
    <br>This means love is greater than everything you practise.
    <br>Whatever name you call it, the name Jesus is love.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>If you are talking of, "Is it a Muslim?".
    <br>- Are they the ones condemning me?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Are Muslims condemning me?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Are they the ones speaking against me?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Aunty, are they the ones saying you should not come here?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Do Muslims say you should not come here?
    <br>- No, sir.
    <br>So why are we deceiving ourselves?
    <br>Where there is love, you will come to me and I will go to you.
    <br>You want to know what I am doing, and I want to know what you are doing.
    <br>Love permits us to do findings.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Love permits us to do findings.
    <br>That is one of the characteristics of love.
    <br>The Lord says that love permits us to do findings.
    <br>He says, "Find out the truth and what?"
    <br>(The truth will set you free).
    <br>That is love.
    <br>My brother, I am not blaming you; you are my friend now as I am talking. I do not blame you.
    <br>The whole thing is from 'far'; it is beyond you.
    <br>I would like to start by affirming what the man of God has just said.
    <br>The nation actually fought the man of God with everything it had.
    <br>It was announced on national television that we Christians should have nothing to do
    <br>with Prophet T.B. Joshua and The SCOAN.
    <br>That made me move and fight with zeal.
    <br>Being leaders in the Christian fold, they handed it over to us,
    <br>then we took it down to the grassroots.
    <br>I fought with vigour to pass down the message.
    <br>I don't know what I can say about those who may have died without coming to
    <br>the man of God for deliverance.
    <br>For those who are still alive, I don't know how to beg you; I have deceived you. Please forgive me!
    <br>If you have a problem, please come to the man of God to sort it out for you
    <br>because this is the centre of solutions.
    <br>Thank you, brother. We want to congratulate you. We thank God for your life.
    <br>Your confession made me voice out
    <br>because no one ever actually knew that I have an award from the Federal Government.
    <br>Nobody knew.
    <br>It is your confession that me voice out that even what you are saying is a small thing,
    <br>and to let you know that you should stop hiding under the Bible to deceive people, "I am a Christian".
    <br>Love is the greatest!
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>And when the man gave the award, the Christians brothers were fighting again.
    <br>You read it in the newspaper.
    <br>They were fighting.
    <br>And the man said, "I am a Muslim and you are a Christian."
    <br>The man was not a Muslim. He said, "I am a Muslim. Why are you fighting?"
    <br>"I am not giving the award to him because he is a Christian."
    <br>"I am giving it to him because of what he is doing for the nation."
    <br>Man of God, I would like to put it this way; I don't know how to put it shorter.
    <br>I know I have been trying to go abroad to look for a mentor because of the anointing I had lost.
    <br>Please, I am begging you!
    <br>You were the same person I said was the bad one or worst one, but I want you to be my spiritual father.
    <br>Mentor me. Please, I need your mentorship.
    <br>Take me and mentor me; I need my anointing back.
    <br>I see no reason for going out of the country when I have seen  that the solution to my family problems is here.
    <br>I want to get all here.
    <br>Spiritually, physically and financially - I need it here.
    <br>I don't want to go outside the country for it anymore since you are here.
    <br>Please, man of God, forgive me!
    <br>Pick me up! Direct me! Let me not make this mistake again.
    <br>Mentor me - I need a mentor like you. Please, sir!
    <br>Thank you. Ask my brother to stand up. It's alright. We thank God for everything.
    <br>It is God that is mentoring us. We all queue and ask God. I can only intervene.
    <br>I will be your intercessor praying for you to ask God to give you direction.
    <br>And I want to assure you, I am at your service.
    <br>Just use me. I am at your service. Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am shedding tears, but they are tears of joy.
    <br>I am happy! Thank you for delivering me.
    <br>I had been in bondage.
    <br>Let me say something. If a pastor - he's not just a pastor, but overseer of a church, he co-ordinates,
    <br>he's not a small pastor - if he is saying this, what of you Christians? A follower?
    <br>Since my deliverance yesterday, I have been free!
    <br>I have peace and I am happy!
    <br>I feel light!
    <br>You will not understand it when people say they feel light until you go through the deliverance.
    <br>I used to be afraid whenever it was getting dark
    <br>because once I shut my eyes, I would see different kinds of pythons.
    <br>I thank God because when I close my eyes now, I don't see those pythons anymore.
    <br>Before the deliverance, whenever I closed my eyes, I would be afraid of sleeping.
    <br>I would tell my husband that once I closed my eyes, I would see pythons.
    <br>He would lay his hands on my eyes and ask if I saw anything. I would say, "No!"
    <br>But the next day, it would continue.
    <br>After this deliverance, they are gone forever.
    <br>To be sincere, I didn't want to marry a pastor. It was frustration that pushed me to marry one.
    <br>I was a model and I was doing well in my modelling job.
    <br>My aim in life was to be a supermodel.
    <br>Whenever men came into contact with me, they would disappear.
    <br>They would propose, but go.
    <br>Whenever they took a picture of me and showed me, it would come out differently.
    <br>It would not be my real image.
    <br>I would wonder what was happening, because immediately they would take a picture of me,
    <br>a different image would appear.
    <br>They would leave.
    <br>When I called them, they would not take my call.
    <br>Then I knew I needed someone to stand in the gap.
    <br>I asked God to help and lead me to a man of God that could fight this battle
    <br>because I came from a family where people hardly got married.
    <br>In my family, I am the first female to get married.
    <br>So I prayed to find a man of God who could stand in the gap for me
    <br>because the men I dated, their businesses crumbled.
    <br>Although I didn't know what happened, I just saw their businesses crumbling.
    <br>I didn't care about what happened. I would simply move on with another man.
    <br>My modelling job fetched me money.
    <br>When I got to know him, he started preaching to me.
    <br>In fact, we were working together but he hated me.
    <br>People that knew us never believed we could get married
    <br>because I was moving from one show to another.
    <br>Each time I came back, he would punish me and ask why I always went out.
    <br>One day, I confided in him and told him that I was a model.
    <br>I showed him my pictures and calendars.
    <br>He asked why I was doing this kind of job.
    <br>I told him that I liked it because it was fun and I got money through my appearance.
    <br>It didn't cost me anything; I got easy money, enjoyed myself and lived a flashy life.
    <br>He said, "No! That is not the will of God for you."
    <br>To me, he was talking rubbish.
    <br>At a point, I said to myself, "You prayed for a man of God to marry you.
    <br>People who had been coming couldn't stand the battle. Why not go close to him?"
    <br>That was when the relationship started.
    <br>When I knew him, he was a very rich man. In fact, that was another source of attraction.
    <br>He was not just a pastor, but also rich and doing very well.
    <br>He said I could dress in the way I wanted but should not expose my body.
    <br>I didn't care.
    <br>I was only accepting what he was saying in order for the marriage to happen.
    <br>I was not prepared to wear the ring or behave as a married woman after the marriage.
    <br>I would just find my way and move on with my job.
    <br>Even though I got pregnant, I was ready to abort the baby secretly.
    <br>I wanted to live a free life, but his spiritual life was holding me down.
    <br>Each time I wanted to go contrary, he would tell me that
    <br>the way to operate in this world is through the Bible.
    <br>As a pastor's wife, I was supposed to support my husband.
    <br>However, while he would be preaching, I would get offended and walk out of the church.
    <br>Whenever he returned, I would create problems for him
    <br>and ask him why he was preaching against me.
    <br>In fact, he never said any word against me in his preachings.
    <br>For the next one to two weeks, I would not cook and he would not eat.
    <br>I would not talk to him and whenever he woke up and greeted me, I would not respond.
    <br>Whenever he wanted to pray, I would not respond.
    <br>He would even tell my parents that he wanted the marriage to end.
    <br>My parents would plead with me and I would start to cook again.
    <br>When we discovered Emmanuel TV, we started watching.
    <br>That was when I realised that there was something behind what was happening to me.
    <br>Although he has said it all,
    <br>I have to testify because it was other people's testimonies that touched my life.
    <br>I want to advise young girls out there that whenever they have a challenge,
    <br>they should identify it.
    <br>One thing that really bothered me was that the money that prompted me to marry him was gone.
    <br>And there was no happiness.
    <br>I asked myself why I got married in the first place and threatened to divorce him.
    <br>The money and enjoyment were no longer there
    <br>and I was no longer doing my modelling job.
    <br>I told him that since there was no money, he should allow me to return to my modelling job.
    <br>Instead of having peace, we were always having conflicts and nothing was moving.
    <br>He told me to accept Christ, otherwise we would sink and nobody would be able to rescue us.
    <br>I would reply that I attended church and I also prayed.
    <br>I didn't know that I was just a nominal Christian.
    <br>I didn't know I needed salvation.
    <br>To be sincere, I was bedwetting before I married him.
    <br>Whenever I visited him, I would wet the bed,
    <br>something that never happened when I visited my father.
    <br>He would wake me up and turn the mattress over while I continued sleeping.
    <br>When I saw people confessing about this,
    <br>I realised it was a problem for me to be bedwetting at my age.
    <br>Emmanuel TV made me realise my problem and I said, "God, have mercy on me."
    <br>I said to myself, "I have to change; I am not living the life of a Christian -
    <br>not to talk of a pastor's wife."
    <br>I Deceived You About TB Joshua -  SHOCKING CONFESSIONS OF A NIGERIAN PASTOR!!!
    <br>Since my deliverance, I have been happy!
    <br>I am happy! I have peace of mind.
    <br>I promise God I am going to stand by my husband.
    <br>We will do the work of God together.
    <br>Clap for Jesus!
    <br>Can you see it's a new confession?
    <br>I forgot to say this.
    <br>When I was a spinster, I used to have symptoms of a pregnant woman.
    <br>I'm in the medical field.
    <br>I would salivate excessively; my tummy and breasts would enlarge.
    <br>Physically, people would not notice any change in me, but I would know I was heavy.
    <br>In the dream, I would give birth to children and feed them.
    <br>Whenever my mother asked me why I was salivating, I would tell her it was due to a cough.
    <br>She would keep quiet.
    <br>I had so many children that I nursed and fed at night in the dream.
    <br>There were many. I fed them, played with them and gave them motherly attention.
    <br>Each time I did that, my menstruation would cease physically, as if I were pregnant.
    <br>After I had given birth and started nursing the child, my menstruation would start flowing again.
    <br>Physically, you would not know that I was pregnant.
    <br>Then you can never turn down my request. No matter who you were you would do it.
    <br>I gave instructions and I was stubborn to the core.
    <br>Also, I have never seen a live snake, but in the dream I saw different kinds of snakes.
    <br>It was not easy for me to graduate from school.
    <br>After I graduated as a medical lab scientist,
    <br>it was difficult to get an internship placement.
    <br>I am a medical lab scientist. I diagnose people and sign.
    <br>My genotype is AA. I used my documents which showed AA, to gain admission.
    <br>The moment he proposed marriage to me and we went for screening,
    <br>my genotype changed to AS and his was also AS.
    <br>I told him my genotype was initially AA and I didn't know how it changed to AS.
    <br>He then said we should get married and that his parents didn't do any genotype test.
    <br>He said this because of the initial genotype test which showed I was AA.
    <br>He said it was a spiritual problem that needed to be tackled spiritually.
    <br>My advice to viewers is: The first thing is to identify your problem.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ! Rise up and clap for Jesus!
    <br>Identify your what? Problem.
    <br>If you don't identify your problem, solution is dangerous.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Identify your problem.
    <br>Then you can move on.
    <br>If you don't identify your problem, there's no way.
    <br>When you identify your problem, your solution is near.
    <br>When you see a person or watch something, don't just start criticising.
    <br>Take your time to find out the truth - like a wise person - before you make any comment.
    <br>When I saw my husband watching Emmanuel TV, I was against it.
    <br>I left the room and he called me back and said, "Sit down and watch what they are doing; we are alone in this room."
    <br>"Let us watch and see what they are doing. Nobody will kill us."
    <br>So I sat down and by the special grace of God, I was totally convinced.
    <br>I knew if I came here, I would get my deliverance
    <br>and my husband's anointing would be restored.
    <br>Thank you.
