    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>Are you ready to love those who criticize you, those who do not see anything good in you?
    <br>That is the best way!
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>I am jealous of you; I want to sit down.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>After his encounter with Jesus Christ through the prayers of T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the evil spirit that was screaming out from inside this man is expelled as he begins to vomit out
    <br>all the poisonous substances that were implanted by the enemy.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>The Book of John 10:10 says the source of sickness, disease and affliction
    <br>is not God, is not Jesus, but satan.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, we shall cast them out!
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>Man of God, my name is Michelle, I am from the UK.
    <br>I have a stiff neck, cervical spondylosis.
    <br>I am a pastor's wife.
    <br>Please heal me; I know I will be healed today, man of God.
    <br>I have high cholesterol.
    <br>Please, man of God, I know today is my time for healing.
    <br>I have a stiff neck; please, man of God, I know today is my time to be healed.
    <br>- I know, man of God, I believe.
    <br>- Okay, it's alright.
    <br>As T.B. Joshua prays for the lady in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>she instantly reacts as the operation of the Holy Spirit takes place
    <br>and restores her back into the original position in which He created her.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>Stand up; remove it.
    <br>Turn your neck.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>Thank you, man of God; thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>I greet you in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>My name is Michelle Roos and this is my wonderful husband Will Roos standing beside me.
    <br>We are originally from South Africa but we live in the UK and we are pastors.
    <br>The problem that I had was a stiff neck; I could not move my neck.
    <br>I could not move anything; I struggled with this for many years.
    <br>The pain was so great.
    <br>And now, I can move my neck!
    <br>Wow. Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Yes, I struggled with this problem for about seven years.
    <br>It affected me so badly that in Israel, when we got here, I could not move; I had to sleep standing up.
    <br>I could not move my neck to the right; it was completely locked.
    <br>I was in so much pain, it felt like a needle was up my spine.
    <br>I have a little baby; I couldn't hold my baby and it was very difficult to feed my baby.
    <br>My husband had to help me with everything.
    <br>I give God all the glory because I can now move, I am completely healed.
    <br>I knew when I came yesterday that this was my moment for healing.
    <br>Man of God, my name is Michelle, I am from the UK.
    <br>I have a stiff neck, cervical spondylosis.
    <br>I am a pastor's wife.
    <br>Please heal me; I know I will be healed today, man of God.
    <br>I have high cholesterol.
    <br>Please, man of God, I know today is my time for healing.
    <br>I have a stiff neck; please, man of God, I know today is my time to be healed.
    <br>- I know, man of God, I believe.
    <br>- Okay, it's alright.
    <br>As T.B. Joshua prays for the lady in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>she instantly reacts as the operation of the Holy Spirit takes place
    <br>and restores her back into the original position in which He created her.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>Stand up; remove it.
    <br>Turn your neck.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>Thank you, man of God; thank You, Jesus!
    <br>And when the man of God, T.B. Joshua, touched me,
    <br>instantly I felt the fire of God in my stomach.
    <br>The fire of God was so strong.
    <br>And during prayer, after he had touched me, I felt the power of God straightening and aligning my whole body.
    <br>The power of Jesus Christ was moving me and instantly I received my healing.
    <br>They took off the neck brace and I could move my neck freely without any pain.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Can you demonstrate for us what you can now do?
    <br>I can move both sides without any pain; I am free; I am healed completely.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>We want to quickly hear a word from your husband before coming back for your advice.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Will Roos from South Africa, living in the UK.
    <br>My wife has said it all; I just want to confirm the miracle that took place.
    <br>My wife was in terrible pain and for a husband to see his wife in so much pain, especially with the children,
    <br>it was very very difficult.
    <br>There were sleepless nights, she couldn't bend; forward movement was so painful.
    <br>No painkillers could do it; it was so frustrating.
    <br>When we came here, when the man of God, T.B. Joshua prayed for my wife,
    <br>I saw the power of God went through her.
    <br>I knew today was her day and I am just rejoicing because I have seen my wife completely pain free,
    <br>moving her neck, and having a good sleep last night.
    <br>This morning she woke up with a smile on her face;
    <br>I thank the Lord; thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Praise the Lord! Emmanuel!
    <br>Hallelujah. For those who are present here today, what would be your own word of advice?
    <br>People of God, stay close to the Lord.
    <br>Put God first in everything you do.
    <br>Make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Stay close to Jesus and let love lead, because He is the answer and your solution today.
    <br>Yours is today; your case will not escape the anointing of God. Amen.
    <br>Amen. Let us here a final word of advice from your wife as well.
    <br>How do you want to encourage those present here and viewers all over the world?
    <br>I would like to encourage you to have faith and believe.
    <br>God's timing is best.
    <br>Have faith and believe; distance is no barrier.
    <br>Whether the man of God touches you or not, there is no distance in the Spirit.
    <br>To access your miracle, just believe and have faith and your miracle is secured.
    <br>Your case will not go unnoticed.
    <br>You will receive your healing, breakthrough, deliverance in Jesus' mighty name. Amen.
    <br>Amen. One more time, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

    <br>My name is Carolina Perez. I came from Japan, but originally from the Philippines.
    <br>I had been suffering from lumbar spondylosis.
    <br>It was mostly here; I could not walk properly because the pain was there all the time.
    <br>When I heard that T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team were coming to Israel,
    <br>I said, "Wow, God! Maybe this is the right time for me to come here."
    <br>Twice a week, I was going for rehabilitation.
    <br>I was given medication; my back pain was like an electric shock.
    <br>All of the time, the pain was there and I was always taking painkillers.
    <br>That's why I came here.
    <br>Guided by the Holy Spirit, T.B. Joshua prays for the people one by one,
    <br>who have travelled from the four corners of the globe to attend the meeting at Mount Precipice.
    <br>I have spondylosis.

    <br>My name is Patricia Tembi Kuwong and I come from Cameroon.
    <br>The problem that brought me to the meeting in Nazareth with T.B. Joshua
    <br>was a knee problem - osteoarthritis for many years.
    <br>They said it was degenerative osteoarthritis.
    <br>I had to wear a knee brace to support my knee.
    <br>For me to go a long distance or stand for long, I had to wear a knee brace.
    <br>What happened to you when T.B. Joshua prayed for you?
    <br>As I was sitting in the prayer line, T.B. Joshua came in.
    <br>Please help me! Since I was young I have had a problem with my knees and all my bones.
    <br>She is having a problem with all the bones in her body.

    <br>The Holy Spirit is in control as the spiritual operation takes place in the life of this woman.
    <br>Glory be to God, she is free!
    <br>Jesus Christ has rewritten her story.
    <br>When he stood before me and touched my knee,
    <br>I felt a shock and my whole body was electrified.
    <br>I just felt a power over me and my legs started shaking; I dropped to the floor.
    <br>All I knew was that I was shaking all over.
    <br>After I finished shaking, I got up and the first thing I felt was that I should run.
    <br>I started running like I had not run in over 30 years.
    <br>Can you show us what you are able to do now that you could not do before?
    <br>Demonstrating her wonderful healing, she exercises her body, excitedly doing what she could not do before.
    <br>I couldn't do this; I couldn't stoop like this.
    <br>I can do that movement and this movement; I can lift my knees like this.
    <br>Healed Of Difficulty In Walking At The Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua - Day 1

    <br>I couldn't do this before.
    <br>Are you feeling any pain?
    <br>I'm not feeling any pain; I'm feeling very light.
    <br>It's like I should do the sports I have not done for many years.
    <br>This knee brace - I don't need it any longer, so I'm throwing it away.
    <br>The knee brace is now on the ground, evidence of her perfect healing.

    <br>When T.B. Joshua put his hand on me,
    <br>I felt fire go from this side of my head down to my whole body.
    <br>Suddenly, I couldn't control myself.
    <br>I felt like there was a spirit that wanted to kill me, to take revenge on me.
    <br>The spirit had enormous anger inside me.
    <br>I felt I was suddenly becoming free.
    <br>T.B. Joshua was commanding the evil spirit to leave me and I was free and began to vomit.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>At just one touch from Heaven, every darkness in this man's life is exposed
    <br>and whatever chain that satan might have used to connect him to himself
    <br>begins to manifest at the command of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>The spirit says, "I want to kill him".
    <br>Whatever he might have eaten from the table of the enemy
    <br>comes out as he begins to vomit out poisonous substances.
    <br>At the touch of T.B. Joshua in Jesus' name, he falls to the ground, set free.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!

    <br>My name is Dr Gordon Mtetwa; I am from the United Kingdom, originally from southern Africa.
    <br>It started in 2012; I was involved in an accident.
    <br>About three years ago, I started developing pain in the lower back,
    <br>Which was diagnosed as spondylosis.
    <br>They also diagnosed osteoarthritis.
    <br>I had been using the lumbar corset for my lower back.
    <br>I had been using this elbow support for my elbow; this was for the osteoarthritis.
    <br>There is also a knee brace I had been using.
    <br>When T.B. Joshua touched me, I felt sudden relief from pain.
    <br>I was in excruciating pain today but after he touched me, I felt immediate relief.
    <br>I am a medical doctor from the United Kingdom.
    <br>For the last three years I haven't worked because of the severe spondylosis and osteoarthritis.
    <br>Having listened to this medical doctor explain the affliction that brought him from the UK
    <br>to the Nazareth meeting, he receives prayer in the name above all names, the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Watch the action and reaction as every sickness in his life is cast out,
    <br>as God uses the faculties of His servant T.B. Joshua to restore him to perfect health.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Can you show us what you can do now that you couldn't do before?
    <br>I can lift my knees; I can move my elbows.
    <br>My neck is fine.
    <br>Especially my elbow, knee and lower back - I couldn't really move them easily.
    <br>So what are you going to do now with these supports?
    <br>I believe I'm just going to throw them away because I don't need them anymore.
    <br>Amen! I'm excited about my healing!

    <br>My name is Nomsa Masinga from South Africa.

    <br>I couldn't do my duties as a dentist anymore.
    <br>When the man of God came to pray for me, I felt something like a magnet on my hand.
    <br>Then, I just found myself falling down.
    <br>After that, he said they must pick me up.
    <br>He prayed for me and said they must remove the arm brace.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!

    <br>After her miraculous healing at The Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua,
    <br>Mrs Nomsa Masinga travelled home and resumed her normal duties as a dentist.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>I am Dr Nomsa Masinga, a dentist by profession. I am from South Africa.
    <br>I was involved in a motor car accident and fractured my left hand.
    <br>As a dentist, I was unable to perform my duties.
    <br>Then, the revival was being advertised on Emmanuel TV for 22nd to 24th June
    <br>in Nazareth, Israel, with T.B. Joshua.
    <br>By the grace of God, I managed to attend that revival
    <br>and T.B. Joshua prayed for me, and I received my instant healing!
    <br>When I came home, I was supposed to start my duties at a later date
    <br>but through the grace of God, since I was already healed, I started my duties earlier.
    <br>I want to thank God because now, I am in a position to use my hands as a dentist.
    <br>I can do my laundry and the cleaning at home.
    <br>I can just do anything with my hands!
    <br>I want to thank You, Lord! I give You all the glory.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The God of T.B. Joshua is alive!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Healed Of Fracture Of The Hand At The Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Her fractured hand is now a thing of the past.
    <br>Mrs Nomsa Masinga is back to her dentist's duties.
    <br>When Jesus heals, He heals effectually, He heals completely.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Hunn; I am from Germany.
    <br>My left eye was heavily inflamed, so I couldn't see.
    <br>I couldn't open my eyes and the pain was like needles.
    <br>It was almost unbearable; I couldn't do anything.
    <br>I decided to come here and receive prayer from T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Before you tell us how you received your healing, can you explain what it was like not being able to see?
    <br>How did this affect you?
    <br>I couldn't do anything.
    <br>The pain was so unbearable that I couldn't see any of the beauty of the country.
    <br>I was just seeing nothing.
    <br>What happened when T.B. Joshua prayed for you yesterday?
    <br>He touched me and I just sensed a huge power touching me and I fell down.
    <br>I just tested it immediately and looked into the bright light and it was no problem at all.
    <br>I could look into the brightest light and there was no pain anymore.
    <br>Please help me, I cannot see.
    <br>I am from Germany.
    <br>I cannot see...
    <br>He said he cannot see; he came from Germany.
    <br>You can see that eye, but right now prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit is going on to restore his sight.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>I can see now, I can see in the bright light, I couldn't do it before.
    <br>"I can see now" is what the man is saying.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Now healed of blindness, he boldly greets those who witnessed his healing.
    <br>They clap for Jesus Christ, the Miracle Worker, in appreciation for the awesome miracle.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So you said that at that moment your eye opened and you began to see - how did you feel at that point?
    <br>It was just a great feeling to see again, to look at the light and have no pain in my eye.
    <br>I can see everywhere; I can see the beauty of Israel's landscape.
    <br>It's just great!
    <br>Let us put our hands together for the Miracle Worker, Jesus Christ.
    <br>What is your advice for people watching you?
    <br>Trust God; Jesus is the answer.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>My name is Cyndi Oliver; I am from the United Kingdom.
    <br>Three years ago, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.
    <br>I had been an active member of my gym and athletics club in my community in London.
    <br>I had been running 5 miles, 10 miles; I had been an athlete all my life.
    <br>All of a sudden, three years ago, I was struck with arthritis that made me not to move or do my work.
    <br>Doctors said to me it was 50-50.
    <br>Before then, they did an operation where they extracted the fluid from the back of my knees.
    <br>The fluid came back and the doctors said to me they were going to do an operation and open me up.
    <br>I said, "No. I am going to think about it."
    <br>Then I came across T.B. Joshua's Emmanuel TV and here I was with my faith.
    <br>I had seen what God had used T.B. Joshua to do for other people that had more trouble than I had.
    <br>I flew from London, came in yesterday and got my breakthrough and healing completely!
    <br>Crying out in desperation because of the sickness in her body, this woman receives prayer in Jesus' name,
    <br>as the man of God commands every root of affliction to leave her.
    <br>JESUS OF NAZARETH BACK IN ACTION IN NAZARETH!!!
    <br>Now free in Jesus' name, the knee braces are removed as she stands to her feet and begins to jump for joy.
    <br>Healed Of Difficulty In Walking
    <br>No Longer Using Knee Braces
    <br>Today, I did my lovely workout which I can show you.
    <br>I kick! I move! Before, I couldn't bend or do anything.
    <br>I thank God I got my healing.
    <br>One of the things I have to tell you is:
    <br>If you truly believe God heals and God will use T.B. Joshua to heal you,
    <br>then all you need to do is apply faith.
    <br>God uses him to perfect the work.
    <br>As I got my blessing and healing yesterday, I pray you will get your own, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen. Let us clap for Jesus Christ, the Healer.
    <br>Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful testimony, and we also want to ask you:
    <br>What did you experience at that moment you received your healing?
    <br>He prayed for me and he touched me.
    <br>One of the things he did was touch my head and I could feel coldness and healing strike my knees.
    <br>I began to shiver and the ushers removed my braces.
    <br>I stood there shaking; I was so scared to put my feet down but when I did, I started running.
    <br>You all saw me yesterday running.
    <br>Why were you running?
    <br>I was completely healed!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Once again we want to see that demonstration of your healing, the things you could not do before.
    <br>I couldn't squat, I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that, I couldn't jump.
    <br>I can do this one thousand times!
    <br>I couldn't do that but now I can and I'm still wearing sandals.
    <br>You can imagine when I put my trainers on, I can even race.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>So now, what do you want to do with the knee braces you once used?
    <br>I want to keep them and hang them up on my wall
    <br>and look at them, look at T.B. Joshua, look at Israel and look at Nazareth, where it all came to pass!
    <br>As a reminder of your testimony!
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Continue to stay in faith, and just see what will happen.

    <br>My name is Amir Younes from Israel; I am 23 years old.
    <br>I was suffering from Crohn's disease; it is an acute infection in the stomach.
    <br>To treat this disease, they had to inject a lot of medication into my veins.
    <br>I had to be hospitalised for long periods.
    <br>Each month, I had to go for one or two hours to take the treatment.
    <br>It was always followed by side effects.
    <br>I had no choice but to bear the effects.
    <br>But when I was at the Nazareth Meeting with T.B. Joshua, he prayed for me,
    <br>and when he put his hand on me, I couldn't hold myself; I wasn't able to control myself.
    <br>I started to shout and shiver because the spirit that was holding me in that bondage of disease
    <br>started to manifest and declare it was the Crohn's disease.
    <br>I believe that this disease has left my life.
    <br>I am healed in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I give thanks to God for His healing and deliverance.
