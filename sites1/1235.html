    <br>Bless His name as our spirits, souls, hearts cry, "Abba Father".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our spirits and our souls cry out naturally, "Abba Father".
    <br>These are the words that resound in our hearts -
    <br>the words spoken by a Prophet - T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Say, "Lord, it is our prayer this morning.
    <br>Lord, take our hearts away from any fleshly desires
    <br>as our souls, our spirits cry out naturally, 'Abba Father'".
    <br>Come on. Bless His name as we worship.
