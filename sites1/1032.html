  <p>    
    <br>My name is Yinka Oduwole.
    <br>When I was growing up in Lagos Nigeria, I never imagined
    <br>that one day I would be an alumnus of the most prestigious university in the world.
    <br>Positive examples are motivators for success.
    <br>My success today I owe to the man, although not my biological father, took me, nurtured me, motivated me,
    <br>inspired me, sponsored me and taught me to believe
    <br>that I could achieve something far beyond what I could ever dream.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "Broken focus is the real reason men fail".
    <br>For many, studying abroad can open the door to distractions and temptations.
    <br>What enabled me to maintain my focus, was to always remember the great trust deposited in me.
    <br>I never forgot where I am coming from.
    <br>As I don my graduation gown and collect my doctorate certificate,
    <br>I know that I am doing it not for myself alone, but for the thousands all over the world who are right now
    <br>being helped, equipped and trained because of T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>We are the leaders of tomorrow.
    <br>With no sign of pressure on her big day, Yinka gets ready for the ceremony.
    <br>She has spent the last four years of her life working, researching, and studying for her PhD
    <br>or Doctorate of Philosophy in Engineering Science at Oxford University,
    <br>thought by many to be the most prestigious university in the world.
    <br>Yinka first heads to Kellogg College, Oxford's largest graduate-only college, where she has been studying.
    <br>Hello viewers, thank you so much for following me on this journey.
    <br>Today is my graduation.
    <br>I am graduating with a PhD in Engineering Science in Oxford University.
    <br>I am here in the halls of residence in my college, Kellogg College.
    <br>I just want to say a big thanks to Prophet T.B Joshua, my mentor
    <br>and Emmanuel TV Partners who have made this journey a success.
    <br>I hope you continue to follow me, and thank you so much.
    <br>Hello, I'm Elsa Bell and I have the great honour today of being the Dean of Degrees.
    <br>This means I help the students on their journey as they graduate.
    <br>It's such fun, such a great honour because this is one of the most important days of their life.
    <br>We graduate in a very serious and solemn way
    <br>but in our hearts, we're cheering for the students like Yinka
    <br>who have worked and worked and worked to gain her DPhil.
    <br>One of the other glories of today is that families, friends and organisations
    <br>all stand by and share in this day of great joy.
    <br>So, congratulations to our students, thank you to all their supporters
    <br>and we know we are going to have a marvellous time!
    <br>Briefing For The Scholars On Their Graduation Day At Kellogg College, Oxford University
    <br>The graduates are invited with their family members
    <br>to hear the briefing of what they should expect in today's' ceremony.
    <br>Briefing For The Scholars On Their Graduation Day At Kellogg College, Oxford University
    <br>The Dean of Degrees of Kellogg College, Emeritus Fellow Elsa Bell congratulates the graduates
    <br>on their momentous achievement and appreciates those
    <br>who made it possible for the students to realize their dream of an Oxford degree.
    <br>Briefing For The Scholars On Their Graduation Day At Kellogg College, Oxford University
    <br>The briefing over, Yinka walks confidently down the same road
    <br>as thousands of other Oxford scholars have done before her.
    <br>Many of whom went on to become world leaders and history makers.
    <br>Having walked down the streets of Oxford,
    <br>the graduates with those accompanying them arrive at the Sheldonian Theatre,
    <br>the principal assembly room in the university where all public ceremonies are performed.
    <br>Yinka Makes Her Way To The Sheldonian Theatre Where The Graduation Ceremony Will Take Place
    <br>The scholars in their academic dress enter a private entrance to the Sheldonian Theatre,
    <br>each carrying their graduation robes in a special bag,
    <br>each colour signifying the academic level they achieved.
    <br>All of which shall be donned or worn at the invitation from the College Council
    <br>as their degrees are granted to them.
    <br>It's obviously a great day for all of you
    <br>to celebrate your academic achievement with your family and friends.
    <br>In this wonderful building, the Sheldonian Theatre at the heart of our ancient university;
    <br>ancient but still very relevant to the problems of the modern world,
    <br>pushing back the frontiers of knowledge.
    <br>I hope you've all enjoyed your years at Oxford - quite difficult not to do so, I think.
    <br>You'd have to have pretty stunted ambitions and interests not enjoy your time here.
    <br>And I hope those of you who come back to continue your studies will also have a great time.
    <br>As you know, we regard everybody who has been a member of the university as a continuing member.
    <br>A university is a living thing.
    <br>Once you're part of our community, you continue to be.
    <br>So, I very much hope hat you'll keep in touch with your college and with the university
    <br>as your careers develop in the years ahead
    <br>I hope you'll go to Alumni events from time to time, even when people like me are speaking at them!
    <br>To be serious, we're very proud of you and we know we will be even more proud in the future.
    <br>Oxford is a great world-class university.
    <br>and one of the ways in which we have defined that over the years
    <br>is that we send people into the world who help to make it a better place.
    <br>I'm sure that you'll be doing that; you'll have all our support in whatever field of activity you choose
    <br>for your own next round of achievements.
    <br>THE OXFORD DEGREE CEREMONY
    <br>Graduation Ceremony of Dr Yinka Oduwole, Oxford University, UK, Sept 16, 2017
    <br>Please be seated.
    <br>Graduation Ceremony of Dr Yinka Oduwole, Oxford University, UK, Sept 16, 2017
    <br>The degree ceremony for higher degrees starts with the supplication, traditionally made in Latin
    <br>by the senior proctor for the candidates to be admitted to their respective degrees.
    <br>Before we begin the degree day itself, I want to say just a few words, words of  congratulations.
    <br>This is of course a proud moment for you all - for you, your families, friends and supporters.
    <br>A moment of exceptional pleasure, to be savoured at length
    <br>and preserved photographically for posterity.
    <br>The degree day is certainly the happiest of the ceremonies in the university calender.
    <br>Unlike the great burst of relief that everyone feels after examinations,
    <br>this a time to recognize and mark formally the personal achievement of gaining a degree.
    <br>We shall see conferred here today quite a range of different degrees
    <br>from Bachelor of Arts to Doctorates.
    <br>But they all have this in common:
    <br>They are all the product of a sustained effort, the application of the mind to complex problems
    <br>and a determination to overcome difficulties.
    <br>Oxford is one of a mere handful of great international universities in the world.
    <br>Our entry requirements are exacting; our courses are demanding;
    <br>our research programmes are uncompromising.
    <br>The opportunities are great in Oxford with its special qualities, its international mix
    <br>and the close involvement of academics in the work of students.
    <br>But the challenges are great also.
    <br>Oxford is not a place, nor does it want to be where a student may rely on being told what to think.
    <br>So, it's not easy to get any sort of degree here.
    <br>Those who teach and research in Oxford know that and they would want me to say to you
    <br>on their behalf that the degree you received today is indeed a considerable
    <br>personal achievement and that you are right to take pride in it.
    <br>In fact, of course, others have contributed to the outcome being recognised here.
    <br>I want most particularly to welcome the families and friends whom I see with us.
    <br>The fact that you are here testifies to your support of
    <br>and commitment to one of the people in front of me.
    <br>Those who study need support and encouragement.
    <br>They need timely comfort and unaffected approval from those closest to them.
    <br>For all of you, support has meant financial sacrifice
    <br>and perhaps the rearrangement of plans.
    <br>So, I do want to recognize that the success we celebrate today also belongs to you.
    <br>I think that the degrees we are giving here represent two things:
    <br>First, they certify that a number of specific skills have been acquired and tested.
    <br>Indeed the formulas that I shall use in a minute's time to confer degrees
    <br>essentially refer to them as licenses to do certain things.
    <br>Most important however, an Oxford degree reflects our intention to promote some qualities of mind.
    <br>to teach people how to learn, how to take charge of their thought
    <br>to teach people how to learn, how to take charge of their thought
    <br>What you know is not as important as what you do with what you know.
    <br>The crucial but also the most difficult qualities towards which we try to help our students
    <br>are understanding, independence of judgement
    <br>are understanding, independence of judgement
    <br>These are the qualities which you carry out from here with your degree.
    <br>These are the qualities which will sustain you in a life
    <br>during which we now know more direct skills will have to be often renewed.
    <br>And these are the qualities which a stable and successful society needs
    <br>And these are the qualities which a stable and successful society needs
    <br>in each successive generation.
    <br>This event is very ceremonial and solemn here.
    <br>Degree days do not have to be so and in some universities,
    <br>they can be quite informal and noisy festivals.
    <br>We think that solemn ceremony is proper
    <br>because the university is bestowing that which is most precious to it
    <br>that which carries the values we proclaim and defend.
    <br>that which carries the values we proclaim and defend.
    <br>We think it is proper because we are paying respect
    <br>to those who have earned that precious prize from us.
    <br>which is the way we show respect in the university.
    <br>The ceremony is also in latin; at first sight, that may appear to you impossibly old-fashioned
    <br>The ceremony is also in latin; at first sight, that may appear to you impossibly old-fashioned
    <br>Let me persuade you of the contrary.
    <br>The university has been in existence for the better part of 800 years.
    <br>I'm not speaking simply of the longevity of an institution.
    <br>but primarily of the the long continuity of an ideal.
    <br>Through shifting circumstances and with varying success,
    <br>the university has sought values of intellectual honesty, independence of judgement,

    <br>and truth - imperfect though each generation's test of that has proved to be.

    <br>Graduation Ceremony of Dr Yinka Oduwole,
    <br>Oxford University, UK, Sept 16, 2017
    <br>Hello, Viewers! Thank you so much for following me on this journey.
    <br>I just finished the graduation ceremony held at The Sheldonian Theatre.
    <br>I have just been confirmed a Doctor in Engineering Science.
    <br>I'm now known as Dr Yinka Oduwole.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>My name is Kevin Lee. I just graduated with a Bachelor in Mathematics & Computer Science.
    <br>I'm from California.
    <br>I feel happy that I got my degree but sad that I'm done with my course.
    <br>I feel excited to continue my life with a degree from Oxford.
    <br>Keep watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>Hi. My name is Jessica Thorn from Namibia.
    <br>I graduated in zoology.
    <br>I specialised in climate adaption and the impact on small holders in Nepal, Ghana and Kenya.
    <br>I just graduated today. It's been a wonderful ceremony.
    <br>It's wonderful to be here with my family to celebrate,
    <br>going to such a historic institution with so much diversity and international contributions.
    <br>It's being part of a network of people who are very dedicated and have taken a lot of sacrifices
    <br>to be able to contribute to a bigger body of thought and continued conversation
    <br>about humanitarian issues, about trying to create a more sustainable way of producing food,
    <br>to producing a more integrated way of nature and livelihoods.
    <br>I am very grateful to be a part of this process.
    <br>My name is Dr Jessica Thorn.
    <br> I just graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy from Oxford University.
    <br>Keep on watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>My name is Edward Still. I'm from Bristol.
    <br>I just got my DPhil in Modern Medieval Languages here at Oxford.
    <br>It's the pinnacle of my studies so far, so I'm very chuffed and pleased.
    <br>It's a great honour.
    <br>My name is Zahid. I'm Canadian-born.
    <br>I did my undergraduate in Toronto
    <br>and then came to Oxford to do a Masters and PhD, both in Neuroscience.
    <br>It's been an amazing experience. I've learnt a lot about the research, about the brain.
    <br>My particular focus was looking at the cellular molecular basis of learning and memory.
    <br>After four years, I was able to discover very interesting rules that govern
    <br>how people are able to remember things for long periods of time.
    <br>I'm off to do a post-doctoral work in Edinburgh University
    <br>and ultimately my goal is to become an academic and a professor of Neuroscience.
    <br>My name is Zahid Padamsey, and I graduated today from Oxford University with a DPhil in Neuroscience.
    <br>Keep watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>My name is Musaiwale Kamfose, and I graduated today from Oxford University.
    <br>Keep watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>After the graduation ceremony, the new graduates and doctors return to their various colleges
    <br>to celebrate with friends and family as well as Oxford professors and academics.
    <br>One of the most prominent among them is Professor Jeffrey Thomas,
    <br>the founder and first president of Kellogg College.
    <br>What a pleasure it is to see Yinka graduate, to become one of the very unusual young ladies
    <br>who has got a DPhil from the University of Oxford
    <br>and I am delighted that she became a member of this college.
    <br>I had the great opportunity a few years ago of helping to found what is now Kellogg College.
    <br>It was founded precisely to give opportunities to people from the United Kingdom
    <br>who wanted to study part-time and to younger folk from all over the world, such as Yinka.
    <br>And I have to say that since Yinka has been here, she has been an absolute star.
    <br>She's been here four years.
    <br>She's joined in everything, very important in the social life of the college
    <br>and absolutely brilliant in her academics.
    <br>I am delighted to see her moving on to what I am sure will be a glittering career.
    <br>So I want to say: Any more folks you have at home like Yinka, please send them to Kellogg College.
    <br>We would be delighted to see them all.
    <br>Congratulations Yinka! Come back and see us often!
    <br>Dr Yinka With Professor Geoffrey Thomas
    <br>Founder & First President of Kellogg College, Oxford
    <br>And I will shake hands now. Well done.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Brilliant.
    <br>My name is Professor Tom Buchanan. I'm the acting President of Kellogg College.
    <br>I have been a fellow here since just after the college was set up in 1990.
    <br>We are very pleased to honour today the success of all our students
    <br>and in particular delighted with the success of the student you've sponsored, Yinka,
    <br>in achieving her DPhil.
    <br>The college is the largest graduate college in the University of Oxford
    <br>and has grown very rapidly since it was set up in 1990.
    <br>We have a very marvellous group of students and we are delighted with the success of all of them today.
    <br>The acting president of Kellogg College Professor Tom Buchanan presents Dr Yinka
    <br>with her official certificate and congratulates her.
    <br>My name is Dr Gary Tonge, and we are here in the UK.
    <br>Today, we have been celebrating the graduation of Yinka
    <br>where she has been admitted as a Doctor of Philosophy  in the University of Oxford
    <br>which is actually the most prestigious university in the world.
    <br>We're very very proud on her behalf and rejoicing along with Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>and Prophet T.B Joshua, who have had the privilege to support her on this amazing journey.
    <br>As a PhD myself, I know how much work is involved.
    <br>I know how much toil and energy is involved
    <br>and now Yinka is no longer a scholar, student.
    <br>She's actually someone who is generating her own ideas, her own research.
    <br>She's not just studying other people;
    <br>she's now admitted to the most prestigious academic community in the world.
    <br>We're very, very proud of her.
    <br>Hello, I'm Mrs Fiona Tonge.
    <br>What can I say? My husband, Dr Gary, has said it all.
    <br>It truly has been a privilege to follow Yinka's progress over the years she's been in the UK.
    <br>What can we say? All glory goes to God and thanks to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and all the Emmanuel TV Partners for such an amazing sponsorship
    <br>of this very, very, hugely talented girl.
    <br>- Congratulations, Yinka! A wonderful achievement.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>I just graduated from Oxford University.
    <br>I was one of four students that actually got a doctorate degree from Kellogg College.
    <br>My degree was in Engineering Science.
    <br>I was awarded the degree this afternoon and it was four years
    <br>and during the four years, there were lots of challenges
    <br>but because of the teaching and mentorship I received from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>today it's a success as you can see and testify to.
    <br>I just want to say thank you so much for making this journey a success.
    <br>It wouldn't have been possible without your support. Thank you.
    <br>I'm just going to show you my name on the programme list.
    <br>I was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering Science.
    <br>My name is here: Dr Olayinka Oduwole. As you can see here, under Kellog College.
    <br>It's a PhD in Engineering Science
    <br>and at the moment, I'm doing a research fellowship at the University of Surrey
    <br>where I'm involved in research and teaching.
    <br>Congratulations, Dr Yinka! Cheers!
