    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>TB Joshua
    <br>QUESTION: Prophet TB Joshua, why were you crying?
    <br>Many people are disturbed by this because we have never seen you cry like this.
    <br>Are you seeing danger coming? Is it danger or blessing?
    <br>ANSWER: Thank God our prayers were answered.
    <br>What we don’t know is that if we reject people on account of the bad ones among them,
    <br>we also reject the good ones.
    <br>To answer the question, I was crying because I saw other African youths joining the revolt
    <br>chasing other Africans out of their countries.
    <br>Thank God our prayers were answered!
    <br> Africa, it is not yet over. Let’s take adequate measures. 
    <br>In the meantime, let’s build ‘a home’ on the outskirts of the city for those who are found breaking the law.
    <br>This will help us to keep the law.
    <br>Take note – it is not only those who enter our countries illegally that are disobedient;
    <br>some who enter legally may also disobey the laws of the land, as well as citizens of the country.
    <br>The police will take them to this ‘home’ before the law takes its course.
    <br>Without this, revolt among them is not yet over, especially in our country, South Africa.
    <br>Don’t forget the prophetic word given in July 2013.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>In the nation, South Africa, we should help them in prayer because I am seeing youth revolt.
    <br>It will be very serious.
    <br>A situation where youth will come out and begin---
    <br>You learn that there is a protest here.
    <br>Some people were killed - certain people.
    <br>Revolt in South Africa.
