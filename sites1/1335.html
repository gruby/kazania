  <p>    
    <br>Look, there's a symptom that is coming out like a water in your stomach.
    <br>Yes, faeces and water. It is getting to two years now - 22 months.
    <br>Since after the surgery, I did...
    <br>Don't worry. That is what I am seeing - the symptoms coming out of your stomach -
    <br>both the water and the...
    <br>Father! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>What do you think is the cause?
    <br>I did an intestinal surgery in February, 2015.
    <br>They said some parts of my intestine were rotten.
    <br>So, they had to cut off some parts of the intestine.
    <br>Then, after stitching it, the thing burst.
    <br>A wrong operation.
    <br>Yes, it then resulted to a fistula.
    <br>I said there is a wrong operation. After praying for you, go back.
    <br>I will tell you to go back to the doctor; they will cover it back.
    <br>If they cover the face now, there is a wrong thing they have cut in your stomach.
    <br>And you carry pads anywhere you go.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!

    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Kate Chimezie.
    <br>By my side is my son, Clifford Chimezie.
    <br>My brother.
    <br>My daughter, Chidubem Chimezie and my son Oluchukwu Chimezie.
    <br>Thank you.

    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>So we would like to hear your wonderful testimony to the glory of God
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of enterocutanea fistula
    <br>as a result of a surgery I went through in February 2015
    <br>whereby the doctors did a procedure called exploratory laparotomy of the right hemicolectomy.
    <br>The problem started just a day like that. I woke up. I was having pain in my abdominal wall.
    <br>I went to the hospital. They sent me for a scan.
    <br>After the scan, when the result came, they said, "Immediate surgery".
    <br>So I went to the first hospital. They rejected me. They were afraid that I was not going to make it.
    <br>They took me to another hospital.
    <br>I was even wheeled to the hospital because I was only - I was not stable.
    <br>I was really bad so the doctors now took me to the theatre.
    <br>When they opened me up, they saw that almost all the intestine was ruptured.
    <br>So one of the doctors, the surgeon said, "We are going to close her up; she cannot make it".
    <br>One of them said, "No! Let's try".
    <br>I heard them calling me,  "Madam, do you believe in the power of God?"
    <br>I said, "Yes, I do".
    <br>So they said, "OK" - they were proceeding  and did the surgery.
    <br>And after that they removed most of my intestine; it was cut off.
    <br>And they sutured it. So after this suturing, I think most of it busted.
    <br>A complication like that then resulted in the enterocutanea fistula
    <br>whereby there's a leakage of faecal matter from my intestine to the abdominal wall,
    <br>which means that I cannot really do so many things because of it.
    <br>I always pad my stomach all the time. I cannot walk very well.
    <br>I cannot stand up to drink water. I cannot sit down to eat.
    <br>I can only lie down to eat or lie down to drink water.
    <br>Each time, I would always put my hand in my stomach to remove all the faecal things
    <br>because as at that time, I was not able to pass stool.
    <br>Okay, you mean to say, madam, that the faeces would come out through your stomach?
    <br>Yes, all the things I ate, the faeces,
    <br>the faecal matter was coming out from my intestine to my abdominal wall.
    <br>I was always removing it three to four times a day. Then we would put plaster on it again.
    <br>Anything I ate, I would feel the movement and it made me very uncomfortable.
    <br>I was not able to do many things, even on the bed.
    <br>I couldn't go anywhere - my business,  everything was closed down.
    <br>And the pain that goes with it, is like.. inexplicable.
    <br>Okay, so just to be very clear, madam, the pictures we are seeing here show
    <br>how these faeces would come from your stomach region
    <br>as opposed to coming through the normal passage after the complications of this surgery.
    <br>Yes, the faeces was now coming out from my stomach - the water, everything.
    <br>What was supposed to go as waste through the rectum was all coming out from my stomach.
    <br>And you said during this period, you could not eat normally, you would have to lie down,
    <br>even just to take a small drop of water and you were even unable to take a bath, is that right?
    <br>Yes, during this period I didn't really eat.
    <br>I ate once in a while. Even that still leaked. I took little water.
    <br>And before I took them, I didn't like sitting while eating. If I wanted to put something in my mouth,
    <br>I would have to go to my bed and lie on my back.
    <br>I couldn't even lie on my side or on my tummy.
    <br>I would only lie on my back. I would just lie down like that and drink water.
    <br>All through this period, I never had my bath for one day - normal bathing like a human being.
    <br>It was only cleaning. I would just clean up, day by day, from morning till night,
    <br>365 days times three. So I never had a normal bath.
    <br>So people of God, we can understand the severity of the condition that our mother was in.
    <br>She just recounted now how for three whole years, she was facing this situation
    <br>after the problem with the surgery. The faeces would pass through her stomach.
    <br>She couldn't take a bath. She couldn't eat normally.
    <br>She had to lie down, just to take a little bit of water and as she ate, she would feel the food
    <br>pass through her stomach until it formed faeces and then she had to take it out through her stomach.
    <br>This was the critical condition that she was in as a result of that complication in surgery.
    <br>Madam, after this surgery, medically, what did the doctors advise you about
    <br>how they could try and resolve this issue?
    <br>When I went from one hospital to the other, seeking second opinions from different medical practitioners,
    <br>what they told me was that, "Madam, you should be happy and thank your God
    <br>that you survived this initial surgery. Don't ever attempt going for any medical procedure again
    <br>because it will be worse or you may not even make it".
    <br>So you were facing the prospect of living like this for the rest of your life as a result..
    <br>Now tell us - in the midst of this, where else did you go in search of a solution
    <br>when this situation was so critical?
    <br>When this situation persisted because they had also told me that the intestine -
    <br>the way it was - a lot of it had been cut.
    <br>I could not be able to lift so many things like lifting weights.
    <br>So from there, I was now going from one hospital to the other again going to churches.
    <br>Then one of the doctors told me that I should allow nature to take its course,
    <br>"Let the healing be a natural thing".
    <br>That I shouldn't go to do anything because of the danger of it.
    <br>So from there, I proceeded to so many churches.
    <br>Like I went to Abuja to one church.
    <br>When I went there, I had to pay money to see the man of God.
    <br>So when I got into his office, they were telling me that they had to calculate how old I was
    <br>so that the money - that's how they would know the exact amount I was going to pay.
    <br>I was also to pay their transport money from Abuja to Lagos, for the healing and deliverance, everything.
    <br>When they had calculated everything, the money was so much. So I said, "No".
    <br>When I was in the office, I saw the photograph of Prophet T.B. Joshua pasted in the office.
    <br>I said to myself, "Wow, this is our dear great prophet, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>So if his prophet is there, if his photograph is there, what am I doing?
    <br>And I know that at The SCOAN, no money is being paid
    <br>for any healing services rendered to human beings".
    <br>Kate Chimezie & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>It was on these notes that I came back to Lagos and came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Okay, now we watched on the clip how this Word of prophecy came about.
    <br>Can you just recount to us that day.
    <br>What happened when you received that Word of prophecy?
    <br>When I came that day, I was privileged to meet with the man of God.
    <br>He came close to me and touched me.
    <br>He now prophesied and said, "There are symptoms coming out from your stomach".
    <br>He asked me, "What was the cause?" I said, "I don't know".
    <br>He said, "Wrong surgery". He asked me, "What surgery?"
    <br>I was trying to tell him. He said, "No, wrong surgery. Don't worry.
    <br>I'm going to pray for you and after the prayer, you go back and they will correct the mistake".
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So tell us, after receiving this word of prophecy, what happened next?
    <br>When I received this prophecy - because initially, I had refused to go for any other surgery
    <br>because people were suggesting that I should go for surgery, go for other medical things.
    <br>I said, "No. I'm not ready" because previously, I've had other surgeries - like four surgeries in my life.
    <br>So I didn't really - in fact, I was very bad, even my photos show that I was not stable
    <br>to withstand another surgery.  So I didn´t want to go for any surgery.
    <br>But when I got here and the man of God now prophesied to me that after the prayer,
    <br>I was to go back to these medical practitioners, for them to do "a correction".
    <br>He said, "A correction".
    <br>That was now what made me go back to the hospital.
    <br>When I got back to the hospital, the doctors told me on the day of the surgery
    <br>that they were going to do a colostomy for me.
    <br>I said, "Wow! Which one is colostomy again?" That they were going to put a colostomy bag for me.
    <br>A colostomy bag is something - it is a bag connected to the intestinal walls;
    <br>from the intestine to the outside abdominal wall, wherein all the faecal matter like faeces and water
    <br>would be stored on a daily basis and you would be emptying it like every four to five hours.
    <br>After like three to six months, I would go back, and they would remove the colostomy bag
    <br>and then restore everything.
    <br>I said, "No. That wasn't what my prophet said.
    <br>My prophet said that I was going for "a correction".
    <br>He said, "Ah!" The other asked, "Who are you?"
    <br>He asked, "Are you Emmanuel?" I said, "Yes".
    <br>He asked, "From where?". I said, "Synagogue Church Of All Nations. Prophet T.B. Joshua".
    <br>He said, "Oh, I know that radical prophet".
    <br>So that was the reaction of the doctor?
    <br>Yes, that was what they said.
    <br>So they said, "OK".
    <br>They told us all the things we were going to get for the surgery. We bought so many things.
    <br>When I entered inside the theatre, my children were outside
    <br>because that time I didn't know what was happening again.
    <br>They were always going outside to meet my children to go and buy this and that.
    <br>They were always buying, buying, buying.
    <br>When they had bought it, they would return it back and tell them, "We don't need it, we didn't use it.
    <br>Go and buy this one". They kept on buying and returning. My children were like, "Oh, what is happening?
    <br>For over six hours, she has been there.
    <br>Nobody is telling us anything - only buy and return. So what´s happening?"
    <br>That was how after like six hours, they woke me up and said, "Madam, we are taking you to your room".
    <br>I said, "Thank You, Jesus!" They then took me to my room.
    <br>On the following day, I was standing on my feet. I was walking.
    <br>Every tube that they had put on me - both in the mouth and nose, everything -
    <br>the following day, they removed everything.
    <br>On the third, fourth day, I was discharged from the hospital.
    <br>And here I am now. I am healed, I am fine, I am good.
    <br>I came here with my family to return honour and glory to whom honour is due, in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>I also thank our dear Prophet T.B. Joshua for what he has allowed God to use him to do
    <br>and also thank our mummy in the Lord, Evangelist Evelyn Joshua,
    <br>for her support all through this period and all the evangelists.
    <br>Now I can go to the toilet normally. I can walk around. I can move around.
    <br>I can lie anyhow. I can do anything.
    <br>Initially, I couldn't do anything. Anywhere I went, I had to pad myself.
    <br>I had to use cloth and tie myself with a belt. I couldn't move.
    <br>I could not do anything. I was not able to do anything.
    <br>Oh, my goodness! It is so much.
    <br>When during the first service this year January 2018, the man of God was declaring a new beginning,
    <br>I was saying, "New beginning? Look at how I am! How am I going to start a new beginning?"
    <br>I never knew it was coming so easily like that, so soon.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, we can all see that our mother is fully, completely restored,
    <br>and we give all the glory to God Almighty for that prophetic word that gave her the assurance
    <br>that God Almighty would actually use the medical doctors to correct the wrong surgery
    <br>and restore her to the position to which God created her.
    <br>We give all the glory to God and madam, we can see a couple of pictures on the board,
    <br>apart from the ones we saw earlier.
    <br>Could you just describe to us what we are seeing on each of these pictures?
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Hey, these pictures here. Initially - that was then, not now.
    <br>Horrible!
    <br>This was my photo - what I was going through in my life during that period.
    <br>In those three years - 365 days times three.
    <br>So this was me. This was how the faecal matter was always coming out from my intestine.
    <br>I didn´t even eat anything, except bread, something that was hard so it could come out.
    <br>If not, it would just flow out.
    <br>Look at it here.
    <br>Look at how it was. This surface was always bloody 24/7.
    <br>Each time I opened it up, it was like they had just performed the surgery that same day.
    <br>Look at it here.
    <br>Each time, every like three to four hours, it was soaked already. It was leaking everywhere, is padded.
    <br>I always used cotton wool, gauze, antiseptic, cream.
    <br>I would then plaster it.
    <br>This was how I tied myself, even more than this.
    <br>Before, I couldn't move because the whole thing was always motion on the surface
    <br>and it was always very, very painful.
    <br>Here are just a few of all the things I used to use for dressing, my drugs.
    <br>This roller plaster, it lasted for like two days. This is just the 5 x 10 cm plaster that I used.
    <br>There are always 5 in this pack, and it lasted for 2 days. This cotton wool lasted for like three to four days.
    <br>Then the creams and all other drugs.
    <br>Besides, when I came to The SCOAN, I was addicted to this drug called Tramadol.
    <br>Everybody knows what Tramadol is.
    <br>I had been on that drug for almost seven years before I came
    <br>because I had had an injury on my leg, a broken ankle that I sustained through domestic violence.
    <br>So since then, I had been addicted to that drug because I was unable to do anything.
    <br>I couldn't stop that drug. I couldn't move.
    <br>I couldn't move my leg and everything.
    <br>But on one of the days, when dear prophet was ministering deliverance,
    <br>he just tapped my face.
    <br>He tapped me on the forehead and went because that time he was always preaching,
    <br>"That if you forget your drug, know that God has done it".
    <br>Each time I prayed, I would ask God, "Please make me forget my drugs".
    <br>And that day, lo and behold, after the tap, I went home. In the night, I didn't feel pain.
    <br>In the morning when I woke up, I didn't feel pain, I didn't remember the Tramadol.
    <br>I didn't take Tramadol and that was how the Tramadol episode left. It has been over for a year now.
    <br>Now there's no more Tramadol. Thank you.
    <br>Wow, let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now we would like to hear a quick word from your children. If we could hear from our brother here.
    <br>Just a quick word, what he can say as a son to see his mother restored
    <br>after such a traumatic experience for the family.
    <br>My name is Clifford Chimezie.
    <br>My mum had been sick for three years, over three years. I think since February 2015.
    <br>It had been terrible since then.
    <br>Sometimes when I went out to have fun with my friends, I would remember that my mum was at home.
    <br>So we understand the emotion our brother is conveying.
    <br>If you put yourself in his position to see your own mother going through such suffering,
    <br>I'm very sure you would express similar emotions.
    <br>But we thank God today that that past pain has been replaced by perfect good health,
    <br>and we thank God that today, it's turned into a testimony.
    <br>So we give all the glory to God for what He has done in the life of this family.
    <br>Brother, you were saying how this really affected you as her son.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>I was the only one in the hospital.
    <br>Kate Chimezie & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>At this point, we can really understand the emotions that are being conveyed by our brother.
    <br>Let's quickly hear from another one of the family members
    <br>as we give our brother a few moments to compose himself.
    <br>We can really feel what he is feeling as someone
    <br>that has seen his own mother nearly at the point of death to where God restored her.
    <br>Our brother, you are welcome.
    <br>Please introduce yourself and tell us what you can say concerning this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Hello everyone. My name is Oluchukwu Chimezie.
    <br>As you have seen my mum was sick for about 3 years.
    <br>It was troubling us for a while,
    <br>even though I wasn't around when she did the first surgery.
    <br>They didn't tell me most of the things she was passing through.
    <br>They just wanted me to concentrate on my studies.
    <br>It was when I came back ending of 2016, I knew the gravity of what she was facing.
    <br>I tried to convince her to go for another surgery.
    <br>She refused. She was like, the doctors advised her against it.
    <br>If she did it, she was going to die.
    <br>Every time we went to the hospital, they kept on saying - they kept on giving excuses
    <br>that the reason why it had not healed was because of diabetes, high blood pressure, or low sugar.
    <br>They kept on coming up with different things, and we would say, "Okay. Let's change the routine.
    <br>The next six months you are going to eat this.
    <br>The next three months maybe you're going to be on total bed rest".
    <br>We just kept on changing (her routine) and nothing was changing.
    <br>Every time she would still come back. We would still buy plasters in bulk every month.
    <br>It was not like something that anyone should go through, any son should go through.
    <br>These things affected our lives in so many ways, even socially.
    <br>You would go out with your friends and you would think you're having fun.
    <br>Then it would dawn on you that someone was at home that needed help;
    <br>someone was not feeling fine.
    <br>Then, immediately, your mood would swing. You would start feeling bad.
    <br>You would not even concentrate again and you would want to get back home.
    <br>You see, Christmas, New Year celebrations, Easter -
    <br>I mean, those were for normal people, not for us. We didn't celebrate those holidays
    <br>because these people that have the luxury to do that, that have chosen to celebrate it...
    <br>When you see your mum when you get home, and you see her like that,
    <br>you would just feel bad.
    <br>Most of the time I ended up just going out. I would go out and have some drinks with friends,
    <br>just so that I could be calm and forget about what was going on.
    <br>I wouldn't think about it that much.
    <br>As I was saying, it's not something that someone should ever go through.
    <br>Can you just tell us as her son,
    <br>how do you feel now seeing her fully restored?
    <br>When you saw her come out of the operation and to see the changes in her life,
    <br>just tell us the celebration in the family since that wonderful encounter.
    <br>It was overwhelming because during the surgery, we saw them coming out
    <br>with this big bucket filled with blood - transparent buckets like this.
    <br>I mean, it was filled with blood and there was this thing moving around in it, floating.
    <br>I was thinking, "Hey, they put my mum's small intestine in there.
    <br>That she's not going to have any other option than to do the...
    <br>Maybe she would just be like that all her life".
    <br>I was later that everybody was like, "We need to know what they did.
    <br>What exactly did they do?" We found out that, "Hey, it's been closed. Everything is fine".
    <br>We were so happy. We were overwhelmed with joy!
    <br>And this was something that I thought would have a recovery time of like 3 months, 6 months.
    <br>In the next two days, I saw my mum walking around. I was like, "What happened? How come?"
    <br>Kate Chimezie & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Few days later, they discharged her.
    <br>I went back. I was like, "Are you people sure? You want this lady to go?"
    <br>They were like, "Yeah, she's fine. You can go. We've done everything".
    <br>I really...
    <br>You don't even understand how joyful I am just now, for what God has done in my life.
    <br>You see people everywhere.
    <br>Maybe you want to be like this person, "This person, I want his life". Or something like that.
    <br>And you don't know that the person might be going through serious depression.
    <br>What I was going through wasn't physical. You would see me. I would be smiling at you.
    <br>But inside, I was going through serious pain every day - every day of my life.
    <br>Basically, you would get people telling you in different ways, "I want to be like you"
    <br>and in my mind I would be like, "You don´t know what I'm passing through"
    <br>but I couldn't really tell them that.
    <br>The celebration has returned to the family and the family can now be happy -
    <br>truly, through this healing.
    <br>I'm really overjoyed. I can't even overemphasize.
    <br>You don't even know what's going through my mind just now.
    <br>Amen! Let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We know there are no natural words to describe it, except to say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>And we know that our brother has really expressed that joy on behalf of the family.
    <br>Let's just hear a quick word from our sister as well.
    <br>My name is Chidubem Chimezie.
    <br>The problem that brought my mum to this church was the problem of fistula enterocutanea
    <br>This really affected her a lot and affected me a lot because I would be in school,
    <br>but most times, I would have to come home. It was just hard doing a lot of things
    <br>because she couldn't really do anything herself. So most times, I had to face school, face her.
    <br>Just mostly mental issues.
    <br>It really affected me school-wise, physically, everything.
    <br>But I just thank God a lot that she's here, and she's healed right now. Thank You, God.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give all the glory to God Almighty.
    <br>We just want to hear a final word from our brother now.
    <br>I just want to thank God because till now, I cannot believe it.
    <br>I still go to her room in the morning to check if it is true.
    <br>During those days, I would dream that I was actually sewing up her stomach.
    <br>These days, I still did not believe it. Even tomorrow, I'm still going to go and check.
    <br>Because I am still in shock. I still cannot believe it yet.
    <br>I'm going to check tomorrow again. I need to be sure.
    <br>Because it was for three years - three very long years.
    <br>A professional doctor said that she was going to die.
    <br>When she went for the first surgery, I was the only one in the hospital.
    <br>How could a doctor come out to tell me that my mother was going to die?
    <br>Why?
    <br>But today she is alive, and fully restored in our midst.
    <br>Yes, she is fully restored. I think she´s getting to seven weeks recovery.
    <br>I don't know how that is possible. It is normally three months.
    <br>But after four weeks, she was fine - completely.
    <br>They discharged her after three days. She was completely fine after four weeks.
    <br>How? I do not know.
    <br>It is God. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So finally, brother, let's hear from you on behalf of the family.
    <br>What is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world and those present here today?
    <br>Ok. I'm actually not a member. I came because of the testimony.
    <br>It's a big one.
    <br>She watches Emmanuel TV so I just come across it, I watched it a little bit.
    <br>I saw the prophet talking.
    <br>But I did not like her seeing me when I was watching it so that she didn't push me into it.
    <br>So I usually hid it from her when I was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>My advice to everybody here is:
    <br>He is one of the few prophets in the country that actually speaks the good news.
    <br>Listen to him. Do not allow these words to be used against you on Judgment Day.
    <br>Listen to him. Don't just take these words, leave this place and forget about them.
    <br>She's a better person today because she listened to him. Forget about the sickness.
    <br>Please listen to him. I know what I'm saying.
    <br>I know what I heard. Just one minute ago, I know what I received. I know what I got.
    <br>Listen to him. Let it always be in your head.
    <br>Remember it. Let it always be in your mouth that you may speak it to the world.
    <br>Let it always be in your heart that you may attain eternal salvation. Thank you.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Finally, we want to hear a final word of advice from you to our viewers,
    <br>with what Jesus has done for you, restoring you completely.
    <br>What is your word of advice and encouragement to our viewers all over the world
    <br>to cap off this wonderful testimony?
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>I'm still thanking God and thanking the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for all He has done in my life and my family.
    <br>I know this not going to be the end of my testimony.
    <br>So what I'm saying and advising the whole world and viewers, anywhere you are:
    <br>This Word - it is only the Word that can set you free.
    <br>The way he always talks about it, the way he stresses it.
    <br>He says, "Listen to it!"
    <br>It will slowly show you what to do, tell you what to do - at any time in your life, at any crossroad.
    <br>When you are with Him and He is with you, you don't have a problem.
    <br>He said that when Job was there and the permission was granted to the enemy to tempt Job,
    <br>he did so because God was holding Job's hand and at the end what happened?
    <br>Job was successful. He was victorious because God was with him.
    <br>When God of Prophet T.B. Joshua is with you, no matter what situation you find yourself in,
    <br>victory is sure, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God for this wonderful testimony. We pray that God will give the grace to this family
    <br>to continue to make His Word the standard for their lives
    <br>and we know more wonderful testimonies are coming, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus, I'm healed.
