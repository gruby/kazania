    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Yes, your birthday is next week.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you want God to celebrate this birthday?
    <br>God is already celebrating this birthday.
    <br>The month of June, you have two revivals.
    <br>One in the UK, and one meeting in Nazareth.

    <br>www.emmanuel.tv/nazareth
    <br>If you really love your pastor so much,
    <br>I think you should dedicate that June 12 - take your time to meet the sick.
    <br>There are many of your neighbours that are on the sickbed.
    <br>When you go to some hospitals, you will see many of them -
    <br>for many years, they have been on the sickbed.
    <br>Meet them.
    <br>Is it time to have friends?
    <br>You have so many friends but you have not had enough -
    <br>you don't even have any of your friends on the sickbed.
    <br>You don't have them.
    <br>A friend that you wake up in the morning and you give a phone call,
    <br>"Hello. How are you?
    <br>How are you doing now? What do you want me to bring to the hospital?
    <br>What do you want me to bring for you?
    <br>Let me pray with you".
    <br>Your children too - that will be duty for your family.
    <br>When you cannot go, your wife will go.
    <br>You have to dedicate that day, June 12, to have friends who have been bedridden for many years.
    <br>Look for them, find them - they are everywhere.
    <br>Not only just needy that you can find at home or widows you can find at home.
    <br>There are many of them - you cannot find them at home.
    <br>They are in the hospital where they are being treated.
    <br>Many of them will be there permanently.
    <br>That has been their home.
    <br>So you should have their number, wake up in the morning,
    <br>"Hello. How are you doing?
    <br>I just want to know how you are doing there.
    <br>Is there anything you want me to bring for you?"
    <br>Many of them - their parents have abandoned them for many years.
    <br>They have abandoned them,
    <br>and they will not have their parents, family anymore.
    <br>Be their family.
    <br>The huge meeting in Nazareth.
    <br>This is just our preparation - our heart.
    <br>So please, over to you.
    <br>It is a big opportunity for you to go out there and look for those who are on the sickbed,
    <br>who have been bedridden for many years.
    <br>If they don't have a phone, you can get one for them and give them a phone call.
    <br>Send your children; let your children know you with that habit - that is a will -
    <br>so that they can continue when you're no longer living.
    <br>I still remember the habit I took from my mum in those days when I was in primary school.
    <br>Any time I came back from school, I had to meet my mummy where she was praying -
    <br>in the farm, in the wilderness, in the mountain - I had to go there in my school uniform.
    <br>Meeting my mummy, sitting down - my mummy would bring food from home,
    <br>keeping that food, waiting for me.
    <br>I got used to that - prayer is the master key.
    <br>Your children too - it is time to give them a divine legacy
    <br>whereby your children can be looking for those who need their help.
    <br>There are many, all over the world - look for them.
    <br>This is an opportunity for you.
    <br>Over to you. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I hope somebody can relate what I have just said now.
    <br>What you just said: June 12 - look for someone who is bedridden,
    <br>who is unable to help himself and show him that love, affection
    <br>and make him feel like someone.
    <br>Not only just look for them - be their friend.
    <br>Be their friend as well.
    <br>Build that relationship, get them a phone, a number where you can get them,
    <br>to be calling them, sending your children from time to time -
    <br>let them get used to that lifestyle.
    <br>When you no longer live, they will continue.
    <br>Birthday celebration - I already started it.
    <br>As I am speaking now, in my house, there are now 60 widows present,
    <br>celebrating and they are giving them cash gifts - now.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>For you now to do better, look for those who are sick, those who are in the home on the sickbed.
    <br>We have many of them everywhere - hospital.
    <br>You must have at least 5 to ten of them as a friend and have their number.
    <br>From time to time, you can call them, "Hello. How are you?
    <br>How are your bones? I hope you are okay now".
    <br>If at the end of the day anyone of them dies, you will be the one to do the burial.
    <br>- Thank you, sir.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have a friend who had an accident.
    <br>Before coming here, I wanted to go and visit her; I kept on postponing.
    <br>But what I have learnt is that whenever you have something to celebrate about,
    <br>the life God has given us, you have to value the life of those who are down.
    <br>So that is the lesson I am learning out of this.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>What our prophet just told us, what I have learnt is that
    <br>we should go to the sick, to the hospitals to find those who are on the sickbed
    <br>and we are not going there just alone to showcase ourselves for a period of time
    <br>but this one is going to be like a ministry which we have received.
    <br>Whenever the birthday of our pastor is coming up,
    <br>we take our children along so that they can see what we the parents do whilst we are alive.
    <br>Even when we are gone, they will remember what they saw us doing
    <br>so that they can continue in these footsteps.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Any other?
    <br>I have a friend who is in the hospital - hospitalised for a year plus now.
    <br>How did you get to know her?
    <br>She is a friend, she is my colleague.
    <br>Ah, that is hand-to-hand.
    <br>She is my colleague.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>She has been in the hospital...
    <br>You have to look for those whom you don't know.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>Ok. Not that you will not help those whom you know.
    <br>I think we have a class for this. Thank you very much.
    <br>As a matter of fact, what the man of God is saying is that
    <br>we should occupy ourselves in the act of helping, irrespective of who the person is,
    <br>irrespective of their religion or wherever their calling is.
    <br>I think that is how I see this...
    <br>Thank you very much. Thank you.
    <br>And take note: not just one woman - you should have hundreds.
    <br>Hundreds in the sense that their case will now become, seems to be a burden but it is not a burden.
    <br>You need something to pinch you, to punch you, to disturb you.
    <br>You say, "Ah, I only have 100 000 Naira and I need 200 000 Naira
    <br>to pay their hospital bill, their feeding".
    <br>You need a situation like that.
    <br>You need something to be bothering you for the glory of God.
    <br>What is bothering you now - they are not for the glory of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You need something to be bothering you for the glory of God".
    <br>What is bothering you now is not for the glory of God.
    <br>Something - for the glory of God - must bother you for you to live above human destruction.
    <br>You will receive a phone call.
    <br>This phone call is from someone who has been on the sickbed for many years
    <br>who is one of your friends, he needs your help.
    <br>But you don't have for now.
    <br>You pick it up, "Oh, I will try".
    <br>Another phone call again.
    <br>But when people are calling you, they are not bothering you for the glory of God.
    <br>They are things that are for your selfish reason, classic reason, material reasons.
    <br>I mean, the people you are helping, they are your people.
    <br>They are your people - very selective help.
    <br>Message Title:
    <br>LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR
    <br>For the glory of God means what they are asking for is not enough;
    <br>you don't have enough but this is for God.
    <br>You need it for you to live above human destruction.
    <br>You need to be bothered for the glory of God.
    <br>Of how many of them do you have their number; of how many friends do you have their number?
    <br>People of whom you have their number are people that are fit,
    <br>are your relatives, friends, family friends,
    <br>are the people that run to you.
    <br>These people cannot run to you - they are somewhere else.
    <br>You are to go to them, and God has to give you the heart to meet them.
    <br>You need to live above human destruction.
    <br>You are facing a lot of threat.
    <br>Nightmares - they shoot you in the dream, poison you in the dream,
    <br>you fly in the dream, you eat in the dream.
    <br>These are the threats you are having.
    <br>There is no peace; you don't have peace.
    <br>How many of you are here today praying, "Lord, bless me.
    <br>I want to help this man. Bless me.
    <br>I want to help that woman"?
    <br>How many of you offer such prayer?
    <br>That is bothering you for the glory of God.
    <br>When you are praying, you will be praying, "Ah, I need this thing to help this person, that person".
    <br>But what prayer have you been offering since morning?
    <br>This is our birthday.
    <br>That June 12 is to rededicate yourself to the act of giving.
    <br>And this giving we are talking about should not be selective.
    <br>You know those who need you most.
    <br>You know those who need you better.
    <br>You know those who need you best.
    <br>Try to reach these people.
    <br>They are on the sickbed. They are in a home.
    <br>They have abandoned them.
    <br>When you go to some orphanage homes, you'll see many children there; they need help!
    <br>Give them your number, a special number; when they call, don't waste time - pick it!
    <br>Let them disturb you.
    <br>When they call you in the night, you say, "Hello. What happened?"
    <br>"I have that pain. There is no money to eat."
    <br>"Ok. I'm coming tomorrow."
    <br>You wake up your son, "Harry, did you listen to that?
    <br>Tomorrow morning, take this 50 000 Naira, meet our friend, give it to him, hug him".
    <br>Your son will be used to this habit; it's a good habit.
    <br>You are reshaping your destiny when you are doing that.
    <br>Your last day - let your children stand to tell the whole world that
    <br>"Oh, this is what my father used to do. He used to send me to this place.
    <br>We have almost 300 people on the sickbed.
    <br>I'm the one taking money to them, giving them money. God help me to continue this".
    <br>Even your will - by the time they will be talking about your will,
    <br>this part of your will will be willed to these people.
    <br>This is the life.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The Bible says, if you truly believe in your heart, your behaviour will reflect your faith.
    <br>I want to see if God's Word is true for your life.
    <br>Let me see your excitement.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, before I pray with you, let's open the Book of John 14: 15.
    <br>Jesus promised the Holy Spirit.
    <br>"If you love me, keep my commands.
    <br>And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate..."
    <br>We don't want to go too far.
    <br>What we are trying to say here -
    <br>"if you love Me, keep My commandments".
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>That is, if you love Me, keep My commandments.
    <br>Hallelujah. "If you love me..." - what is the meaning of that?
    <br>"If you love Me, you will keep My commandments."
    <br>How do we keep God's commandments? How do we love God?
    <br>By doing what God wants.
    <br>By doing what God wants, we demonstrate our love to Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "By doing what God wants, we demonstrate our love to Him".
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[By doing what God wants, we demonstrate our love to Him.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[By doing what God wants, we demonstrate our love to Him.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[By doing what God wants, we demonstrate our love to Him.]
    <br>That is the word 'love' - you say, "I love God. That is why I come to church".
    <br>It is the same God that says, "Thou shall not kill, thou shall not destroy". 
    <br>Not with mere words but with action and in truth.
    <br>Now you say, you love God - over to you.
    <br>It is your turn now to obey, being what God wants.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Being what God wants.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Being what God wants.]
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Being what God wants.]
    <br>That is the only way you can demonstrate your love.
    <br>So this is the step now.
    <br>It is a command, our responsibility, an obligation - you must!
    <br>If you love Him, keep His commandment.
    <br>Love is life; if you don't love, you miss life.
    <br>Life is love; love is life.
    <br>You are a human being not because you have ability to think
    <br>but because you have ability to love.
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>And I know God will bless you with this word.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am a human being not because I have ability to think but ability to love".
    <br>If no one loved you, you could not come here today.
    <br>If you were deserted by everyone, you would not be here today
    <br>because there is no way you could come here.
    <br>The little love given to you actually led to your coming here.
    <br>The love you give away is the only love you keep.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The love you give away is the only love you keep.]
    <br>Open your heart.
    <br>Receive your deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching you.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Begin to curse it in your blood, bones, kidneys, liver - whatever that is not of God.
    <br>Whatever affliction in your bones, in your blood - begin to curse it -
    <br>be cursed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Be cursed!
    <br>In your blood - affliction, be cursed!
    <br>You affliction, disease, sickness - I command you to leave that bone, blood, kidney, liver!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You can know if you are touched; God's Word says you can know.
    <br>You can know if you are healed; God's Word says you can know.
    <br>You can know if you are delivered; God's Word says you can know.
    <br>Right now, begin to give thanks to God and check yourself.
    <br>Cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>Seal your blessing with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>Seal your deliverance with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Right now, begin to count your blessings.
    <br>Count your blessings
    <br>Name them one by one
    <br>Count your blessings
    <br>See what God has done
    <br>Count your blessings
    <br>Name them one by one
    <br>And it will surprise you
    <br>What the Lord has done
    <br>Give thanks to God for His faithfulness,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Right now, stretch your hand. Touch your business. Touch your career.
    <br>My career - it is a new dawn!
    <br>My business - it is a new dawn!
    <br>My marriage - it is a new dawn!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[It is a new dawn!]
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Pray for your nation.
    <br>Wherever there is unrest - calmness, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Pray for your leader.
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>Right now, pray for your righteous journey.
    <br>You want to be God's channel.
    <br>I want to be God's channel - channel of light where there is darkness,
    <br>channel of love where there is hatred,
    <br>channel of humility where there is pride,
    <br>channel of faithfulness where there is unfaithfulness,
    <br>channel of obedience where there is disobedience.
    <br>Use me, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
