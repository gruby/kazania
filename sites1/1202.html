  <p>    
    <br>There is a woman there! You keep seeing dead people in your dream all the time.
    <br>Please, come out.
    <br>Man of God, help me. I am the woman who always sees dead people in the dream.
    <br>I always see dead people, and that is why I came here.
    <br>You don't want to die?
    <br>I don't want to die now, my children are still small. I'm a widow.
    <br>Forget about that.
    <br>I don't want to die.
    <br>If you are ready to live for God, you will not die.
    <br>I am living for God, Man of God.
    <br>You have been living for God? Ok, it's alright.
    <br>If you have been living for God, you would not be afraid of death. Over there is our home.
    <br>Who will take care of my children that are here, if I go there?
    <br>Where?
    <br>The place you are talking about now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The place I am talking about now?
    <br>You don't know the place?
    <br>I know. If I'm saying...
    <br>No, no. The place I'm talking about - as if I'm the only person that knows the place.
    <br>Does it mean you don't know the place?
    <br>I know the place, Man of God.
    <br>Where is the place?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where is the place, if you know the placet?
    <br>It's too early for me to go there now.
    <br>- It's too early for you to go there?
    <br>- Now.
    <br>Are you saying it was too early for Jesus to go there at 33?
    <br>How old are you now?
    <br>No, His own was a...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>His own was a divine something.
    <br>- Your own is what?
    <br>- His was predicted.
    <br>His own was divine something and it was for a purpose.
    <br>What of your own?
    <br>I don't know now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I said that I'm a widow and my children are very small.
    <br>It's like you know death is coming.
    <br>That is the question. Answer me.
    <br>It's because I am seeing dead people.
    <br>It's not good for someone living here to be associating with dead people while sleeping.
    <br>So, you have denied your husband?
    <br>That's not what the Bible says.
    <br>The Bible says that after death, there is no husband and wife again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I know you have some splendour, wealth you don't just want to leave behind.
    <br>It's just because of my children.
    <br>If they were grown up, I won't bother.
    <br>We will ask God.
    <br>If you are going to live for Him, this death, we will remove it.
    <br>But if you are not ready to live for Him...
    <br>I am ready to live for Him all the days of my life, Man of God.
