    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>Children of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Niel Pompi Maake from South Africa.
    <br>I hereby confirm the prophecy that I got from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He prophesied to me that I am having eight women in my life
    <br>and I have kids with each and every one of these women.
    <br>All the kids I am having with these women are eleven.
    <br>I confirm this word of prophecy to be true.
    <br>This prophecy brought deliverance to my life
    <br>and it also brought deliverance to all the kids I am having and their mothers.
    <br>As you can see here, these are the pictures of all the kids.
    <br>This is the first one.
    <br>This is the second one.
    <br>This is another one.
    <br>Also this one here.
    <br>Also this one.
    <br>This here, it is not the same person; these are twins.
    <br>I got them from one of the women that I met with.
    <br>At the time, I was drinking.
    <br>I had this spirit of lust
    <br>Ok.
    <br>Mr Niel Pompi Maake
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Actually, I would say, it all started after the death of my father.
    <br>I possessed this old spirit from my father.
    <br>I went to a spiritualist; he told me that I have got the spirit of sangoma
    <br>and in my life I will never work or be under someone - I'm self-employed.
    <br>After all, I started having dreams, seeing snakes
    <br>and I also dreamt of an old woman.
    <br>Actually, it was like I was in a river with other people; we were swimming
    <br>and they called my name - 'Pompi'; my traditional name is Pompi.
    <br>If someone calls that name, it means, he knows me.
    <br>They said, "Someone is calling you"; when I looked, all those people disappeared.
    <br>Where I was standing in the river, it opened and I saw myself going down, under.
    <br>There, I found this old woman with one big eye here.
    <br>She said to me that she wanted to show me - it was an underworld or something -
    <br>the place she showed me was full of traditional medicine.
    <br>I asked her if I will be able to know all those medicines there.
    <br>She said to me, "You will know because this place, it belongs to you".
    <br>"My mother", meaning her mother gave her that place and now she is tired;
    <br>she wants me to take over the place.
    <br>I had another dream.
    <br>I was running in a pool of snakes.
    <br>Then I met this tall man; I didn't see his face.
    <br>He gave me a crown - a crown like a golden snake.
    <br>He said to me that I just had to say whatever I wanted in my life and it would come to pass.
    <br>When I left that place, I saw some old women.
    <br>They were whispering, saying, "Oh, is this the one that got the crown!"
    <br>After that, my life started changing, I started drinking, socialising with my friends.
    <br>This spirit also gave me anger.
    <br>I could not sit with people for a long time.
    <br>When I got angry and started fighting them, I would not know what was happening
    <br>and I would get angry in the way of just hitting everyone until I saw blood on my hands;
    <br>that's when I would stop.
    <br>When I got angry, it was like I couldn't feel myself.
    <br>I had a pain at my back and whenever I felt that pain, I would start shaking
    <br>and I wouldn't know what would happen next.
    <br>Whenever people tried to fight with me, I sometimes did something with my eyes -
    <br>I didn't know what they saw - and if I did that, I could see
    <br>they would start moving back, seeing that I was getting angry.
    <br>And sometimes, I could even say...
    <br>For instance, when I was with my friend, I would tell him to tell those people
    <br>that I was now getting angry and they should back off.
    <br>Otherwise, I wouldn't know what was going to happen.
    <br>It possessed me in a way that I was going to night clubs.
    <br>I remember that when I met the first woman with whom I have two kids,
    <br>when we left the night club, there were people that were trying to rob us.
    <br>They were six and they had guns.
    <br>I fought with those people, took the guns from them and threw them away.
    <br>After that, I didn't know what happened.
    <br>One of them had a gun and shot me six times.
    <br>I was in the hospital for two weeks after being shot by those people.
    <br>When I was in the hospital, they told me that the guy who shot me was dead.
    <br>Before I started drinking, I didn't think of women;
    <br>I would just sit alone and be quiet.
    <br>But when I was drunk, I could not sleep alone;
    <br>I would be changing women every day.
    <br>I had been doing that for more than nine years.
    <br>All these women - I don't know if there are some others -
    <br>some of the women I have been with have kids for me
    <br>and they also told me that those kids - eleven of them - are also possessed with the same spirit
    <br>and they have now become like me or even worse; they have got powers.
    <br>This lady that I met that has twins for me - when I met her, she was doing prostitution.
    <br>After she became pregnant, she wanted to abort the pregnancy.
    <br>Then I said to her because I was having this feeling that if she aborted the pregnancy, she would die,
    <br>she must not do the abortion; otherwise, she would die.
    <br>She said to me that there are people who want kids and she is going to give the baby away.
    <br>I said to her, "If you give away the baby, then I don't know what is going to happen.
    <br>Something bad is going to happen".
    <br>Those kids are special.
    <br>There will be no one who can raise them and be with them.
    <br>When I look at them, I can see what is happening with them.
    <br>The other thing they told me was that those kids are not my kids.
    <br>At the age of 13, they will all die or else...
    <br>The evil spirit wanted to use them to destroy.
    <br>It all started like this:
    <br>I was staying with one of these women - the ninth one;
    <br>the one that doesn't have kids with me.
    <br>We started fighting one day after I had come back from attending a funeral.
    <br>She was thinking that maybe, I had been with one of those women.
    <br>She poured boiling water on me.
    <br>After that, I was so angry; I started acting the way I used to act when I got angry.
    <br>I didn't see what I was doing.
    <br>Something was telling me that I must kill her.
    <br>When I came back from the hospital, she said to me that she did not pour the boiling water on me;
    <br>she saw my eyes changing to a snake's eyes
    <br>and she was like pouring the water on the snake.
    <br>She asked me to watch Emmanuel TV and see maybe what is happening.
    <br>I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was listening and acting the way they said we should touch the screen, believe and pray.
    <br>I prayed with them.
    <br>After that, I started seeing myself moving like a snake.
    <br>Then I started feeling the power.
    <br>After that, I began to vomit blood.
    <br>So that was when you started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>That demon started manifesting in you, and you started vomiting blood, right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Last Sunday, when the man of God came to you, prophesied to you
    <br>and prayed for you, tell us what you felt
    <br>and how your life has been since after that prophecy and deliverance.
    <br>When the man of God was coming to touch me,
    <br>by the time he touched me, I don't know how to explain the feeling.
    <br>It is like when you are in a hospital,
    <br>there are those two things that they hit someone with when he is in coma.
    <br>The hand came like a lightening and then I jumped - I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>I thank him for delivering me from the spirit
    <br>and I also hope and believe that my kids and all the women are delivered, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let us clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Right now, I feel so light.
    <br>I used to be a kind of person that was not afraid of anyone.
    <br>But right now, I'm even scared of talking and standing here in front of people.
    <br>I feel so relieved.
    <br>Mr Niel Pompi Maake
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Did you at any time receive such things from the demonic powers you possessed
    <br>and what has become of those things?
    <br>It started when I became very famous; I don't know how.
    <br>I was changing cars.
    <br>My first car, I sold it and bought another one and another one.
    <br>Almost every three months, I was driving a new car.
    <br>It all started like that.
    <br>I became too famous; everyone was talking about me all over, wherever I went.
    <br>I was having relationships everywhere I went.
    <br>I used to drive too many cars, I cannot even count them.
    <br>It was like everything was flowing; I was getting money in a way I cannot understand.
    <br>The business was moving.
    <br>After I started attending church, that's when the demons started collecting all they had given me.
    <br>The man of God once mentioned in his message that when satan gives you anything with his right hand,
    <br>he will use his left hand and take from you what your life depends on - everything.
    <br>So he gives you nothing for nothing.
    <br>That is to show you that it is all vanity whatever we receive from the hands of the enemy.
    <br>My word of advice to the youth, most especially to ladies:
    <br>They must not just be tempted by a rich, old man.
    <br>Like me, I used to sometimes date young girls.
    <br>Because of money... - my message goes straight to them.
