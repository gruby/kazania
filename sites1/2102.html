  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Shall we just rise up for a moment?
    <br>Your Bible.
    <br>Say: His gift to me.
    <br>His gift - not only committing it to your memory; being an integral part of your being.
    <br>Being what? I can't hear you.
    <br>- Being an integral part of your being.
    <br>- Again.
    <br>Integral part of your being.
    <br>Wave it.
    <br>Say: It rejoices the heart.
    <br>It has a purifying power.
    <br>It has a healing power.
    <br>It is enduring.
    <br>- Again.
    <br>- It is enduring.
    <br>It keeps me from sin and error.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>It is so profitable.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Your Bible is God's gift to you.
    <br>Do you see it in that way?
    <br>If your Bible is His gift to you, it means not only committing it to memory.
    <br>You open your Bible from Genesis to Revelation and read just like you are reading literature.
    <br>You read it just to preach the Word.
    <br>You commit it to memory.
    <br>But you should read to do what the Word says, because your life depends on it.
    <br>Not only committing it to memory, but an integral part of your being.
    <br>Because the Holy Spirit breathed through men the Holy Scriptures.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The Holy Spirit breathed through men the Holy Scriptures.
    <br>This means, the holy men were carried along by the Holy Spirit as they spoke the Word that came from God.
    <br>When you quote the Bible, you are quoting the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When you are saying, "In ... Genesis verses ...", "In 1 Corinthians ...", you are quoting the Holy Spirit.
    <br>This is the difference between the history, the literature, and other books you can think about -
    <br>when you are reading them, you are reading about events.
    <br>But here, when you are reading the Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It means, when you are reading, you must be carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>That is the difference of any other book you can think of.
    <br>You can just pick any other book at your free time and decide to finish the book,
    <br>but the case of the Holy Spirit is not like that.
    <br>Other books, you can commit them to memory,
    <br>but this one, not only you must commit it to memory,
    <br>but it must become an integral part of your being because it lives in us.
    <br>Our lives depend on it.
    <br>Can you see the difference?
    <br>Your answer is in the Word.
    <br>There are many things unanswered in your life.
    <br>You are wondering, "Why this? Why that? I am working so hard - little reward or no reward".
    <br>"Why this attack? Why that attack? Why nightmare?"
    <br>"Why this frustration? Why this limitation in this, in that? Why?".
    <br>The answer is in this book.
    <br>When Jesus was being tempted, He did not cry out for someone to come and help.
    <br>He did not fall into self-pity, but quoted the eternal Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: My answer to everything is here.
    <br>It is here.
    <br>When you are carried along by the Holy Spirit while reading, while quoting, it provides answers to everything.
    <br>Are you sick? The answer is here; that is healing.
    <br>Are you demoralised? The solution is here.
    <br>Are you worried? The answer is here.
    <br>Limitation in progress? The answer is here.
    <br>When you read, it sees you and you see it; you can see yourself. It is a mirror.
    <br>The answer is here.
    <br>It keeps you from error and sin.
    <br>When you are on the wrong path, to take you to the right path - here; you can find the direction.
    <br>It has a healing power.
    <br>That is, whatever you need healing for is here.
    <br>When you know the answer is here, then what next?
    <br>You have to talk Scripture in every situation.
    <br>- Talk what?
    <br>- Scripture.
    <br>In every what? Every situation.
    <br>You may be on the phone, "Hello".
    <br>Answer someone with the Word of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Use the Word of the Holy Ghost to answer someone.
    <br>If somebody calls you, "Can you please help me? I'm in trouble now. Will you please help me?".
    <br>Inside you, you are not ready to help. But you say, "I will help you".
    <br>That is not the Word of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>But you can help, and you are in a position to help.
    <br>You say to the person, "I will help you". That is the Word of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Use the Word of the Holy Ghost to answer someone.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Use the Word of the Holy Ghost to answer someone.
    <br>What is the meaning of 'the Word of the Holy Ghost'? The Word of the Holy Ghost is the Word of truth.
    <br>The Holy Ghost is truth.
    <br>You cannot do it, you say, "I cannot do it".
    <br>If you can do it, you say, "I can do it".
    <br>But you cannot do it and you say, "I can do it", whereas you cannot do it.
    <br>But you can do it.
    <br>Because you don't want to do it, you deceive people.
    <br>That is not the Word of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Talk Scripture in every situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Talk Scripture in every situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You may be on the phone, or in a business transaction, talk Scripture in every situation.
    <br>Use the Word of the Holy Ghost to answer someone.
    <br>Talk Scripture in every situation.
    <br>What does that mean when I say, 'Talk Scripture in every situation'?
    <br>When the goings are good for you and when the goings are hard for you.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>Imagine I am having serious pain.
    <br>I just receive a call.
    <br>The person says, "Can you help me?".
    <br>"Please don't call me! Don't call me!".
    <br>No, you have to remember whom you are,
    <br>because you were created to be special.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I'm created to be special.
    <br>You are not like others.
    <br>Others, when the goings are good they smile.
    <br>Others, when the goings are bad they cry.
    <br>But now you behave like others.
    <br>How do we know whom you are, where you belong?
    <br>Believers, when the goings are good, Jesus is Lord; when the goings are tough, Jesus is Lord.
    <br>Because they know that Jesus speaks strength and courage through their trials.
    <br>And at the same time they know that their trial qualifies them for a promotion.
    <br>They know that their promotion qualifies them for a reward.
    <br>If I am talking to you let me see your hand.
    <br>Any time there is a trial for you, as a Christian, you know promotion is coming.
    <br>What do I mean by 'trial'?
    <br>Your trial could be poverty.
    <br>That is why many teachings today, when I listen to them,
    <br>they say, "Once you are a Christian, you cannot be in hard times, you cannot be sick, you cannot be poor".
    <br>No. That is not a good teaching, my brother.
    <br>We can be poor, but our poverty is not like others'.
    <br>Our poverty is to qualify us for promotion.
    <br>If you are a Christian, you can be sick, but our sickness is not like others'.
    <br>You can even have what doctors call cancer.
    <br>A doctor will say, "This is cancer", whereas you are a Christian.
    <br>Yes, you are still a Christian. That cancer in you is not like others'.
    <br>Others' is to kill them and to destroy them, but yours is for the glory of God.
    <br>Christians, believers and others, you begin to see Jesus in a bad light when trouble comes.
    <br>You begin to ask yourself, "Why this? Why that?" when trouble comes.
    <br>"Now I accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour. I have stopped smoking. Why am I still having attack?".
    <br>You believe because you stopped smoking that is why you should be holy.
    <br>No one can say no to sin. No one.
    <br>You say, "I will not smoke again", but when you see a cigarette you say, "I don't want to look at it".
    <br>But the urge is there.
    <br>In your dream you are still carrying it out.
    <br>Why can't you stop the one in the dream?
    <br>When one stops, God is involved.
    <br>A believer is not someone who carries the Bible everywhere, going to church regularly.
    <br>There is more to that.
    <br>If you are a true believer, you must be a doer of the Word -
    <br>not only commit the Word to memory, as if you want to sit for an exam.
    <br>When they mention any chapter in the Bible you can quote it from Genesis to Revelation -
    <br>you know every text in the Bible.
    <br>No. Not only must you commit this Word to memory, but it must become an integral part.
    <br>Your life depends on it - that is integral part.
    <br>You become a doer of the Word, then you are a Christian.
    <br>When the Word becomes an integral part of your life
    <br>it means there is seed - uncommon plan of greatness.
    <br>You are not like others.
    <br>You are a very special person.
    <br>Then you begin to act with God.
    <br>And when you begin to act with God, you begin to know God's opinion about yourself and others.
    <br>When the Word becomes an integral part of your being,
    <br>you begin to see the truth in the Word.
    <br>There is truth in God's Word.
    <br>You cannot realise, you cannot understand, you cannot receive the truth in the Word
    <br>unless the Word becomes an integral part of your life.
    <br>The answer is in the Word.
    <br>When Jesus was being tempted, He did not cry to Pharisees and Sadducees, "Help Me!".
    <br>He answered by quoting the eternal Word of God.
    <br>The Book you are carrying is a book in the hands of many, but a Holy Book in the hands of a few.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: It is a book in the hands of many, but a Holy Book in the hands of a few.
    <br>When the Bible becomes a Holy Book in your hand, it becomes a tool.
    <br>The Word of God is the tool in the hands of the Holy Ghost - instrument, weapon.
    <br>When you are sick and you quote the Word, you get healed.
    <br>When you are poor and you quote the Word, you are blessed.
    <br>When you are being demonised and you quote the Word, you are delivered.
    <br>It becomes a tool - instrument in your hands.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Talk Scripture in every situation.
    <br>You may be on the phone or in a business transaction,
    <br>use the Word of the Holy Ghost to answer someone.
    <br>Your answer is in the Word of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>When Jesus was being tempted, He did not cry to people,
    <br>He did not fall into self-pity,
    <br>but simply answered by quoting the Word of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>GOD'S SPECIAL GIFT TO US!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>I know many have received a revelation now about this Holy Bible.
    <br>And now you have received a revelation:
    <br>The revelation is that it is not a book; it is a Holy Book.
    <br>When you are reading it, you must be carried by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>What do you need to do when you want to read?
    <br>Immediately go on your knees. Ask God, "Draw me close to You; draw me towards You".
    <br>When Jesus met Peter, Peter was running from Him.
    <br>He said, "I am not worthy to see You, to stand by You".
    <br>Jesus was running after him. Peter said, "No. I am a dirty person. Please".
    <br>When you don't pray and you pick the Bible, you are reading a book.
    <br>Prayer and reading the Bible must go together,
    <br>because you must know that what you are about to carry is a Holy Book and you need to be on your knees.
    <br>You don't need to pray before picking the literature book or any other book.
    <br>You don't need to pray; you just pick it and read it.
    <br>But this one, you need to pray because it is God's gift to you.
    <br>If this is God's gift to me, God needs to draw me towards Him.
    <br>If I am not drawn towards God, I am not worthy to take His gift.
    <br>Go on your knees and say, "Lord, draw me towards You.
    <br>Whatever iniquity, whatever hindrance in my life, draw me towards You.
    <br>As I am reading, open the door of my heart.
    <br>Let me understand what I am reading - revelation about this,
    <br>because there is truth in the Word,
    <br>there is healing in the Word,
    <br>there is deliverance in the Word.
    <br>Lord Jesus, I am about to take your Word and read. Give me a revelation, Lord Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for answering my prayer".
    <br>You move forward and say, "Thank You for Your gift to me".
    <br>You now open and begin to read.
    <br>As you read, you are in it; God is in it.
    <br>You want to see God? He is there, face to face.
    <br>As you have that mindset that you want to see God face to face, you will see Him.
    <br>Immediately after you have dropped it, begin to talk Scripturally - what you have read, talk it in every situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I know where I belong.
    <br>Where I belong does not allow me to kill, to destroy, to deceive people.
    <br>I know where I belong.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again: I know where I belong.
    <br>You know where you belong. No matter the situation before you, you laugh.
    <br>Remember Joseph.
    <br>When Joseph was dropped into the dry pit, he said to himself, "I know where I belong".
    <br>"That is, here is not where I belong".
    <br>When he was in the prison, he spoke to himself saying, "I know where I belong".
    <br>When you know where you belong, whatever situation you are in cannot hurt you,
    <br>cannot impair you, but improve you.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, tell your situation:
    <br>I know where I belong.
    <br>Tell your situation: I know where I belong.
    <br>When you say that, you overcome.
    <br>'Where you belong' means whatever situation you are in now, is not meant to kill you.
    <br>Remember Paul Apostle - the thorn in his flesh.
    <br>Three times he went to Jesus, and Jesus said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you".
    <br>He now surrendered by saying, "Yes, I know where I belong. I can never and I will never be destroyed by any situation".
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I know where I belong.
    <br>You are created very special.
    <br>You have an uncommon plan.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah.
