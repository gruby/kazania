  <p>    
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Let someone say, "I am moving higher because I am walking with the Lord".
    <br>Give thanks to Jesus for that.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Say, "Lord Jesus, we thank You for every moment of Your attention."
    <br>We are in Your presence, undeserving of Your grace.
    <br>Let Your favour and Your mercy speak for us.
    <br>Say, "Viewers, you are welcome, in Jesus' name."
    <br>Have your seats in His presence.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>You are fine?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>You are blessed, you are fine because of Jesus.
    <br>Brethren, we are called to put on Christ as our righteousness.
    <br>Remind you neighbour, say, "Neighbour, you are called to put on Christ as your righteousness."
    <br>But sometimes, particularly when we are young, we believe we can go it all alone
    <br>without any reference to God.
    <br>Little do we realise that man may toil and labour hard
    <br>but it is the duty of God to determine the time and season of harvest.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, what is your plan?"
    <br>When we are making plans for the future without any reference to God Almighty,
    <br>when you make plans for tomorrow without any reference to God,
    <br>we are guilty of the sin of arrogance and self-sufficiency.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>The unique temptation of a Christian can be spelled out in five words:
    <br>fear, ego, pride, greed and moral compromise.
    <br>The Scripture says that all high places are slippery places.
    <br>When we are prideful, we grieve the Holy Spirit and hurt Him
    <br>because we have chosen to follow the suggestion of the adversary, the suggestion of satan.
    <br>Satan always suggests to do what is wrong.
    <br>That is why as we grow in power, as we grow in influence, in success,
    <br>these temptations increase in our behaviour, in our character.
    <br>But I have good news for you.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, there is hope".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, if you make a mistake - as we all do - don't run from God, run to Him."
    <br>The Bible says when our weakness is exposed,
    <br>when imperfection hits, it is our duty to choose the path of faith
    <br>and humility and run to God, who is merciful to rescue us,
    <br>to sustain us and to get us back up.
    <br>This leads us to our message this morning:
    <br>THE PATH OF FAITH AND HUMILITY
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, follow the path of faith and humility".
    <br>No matter what comes, no matter what happens, do not be derailed.
    <br>Follow the path of faith and humility.
    <br>I believe today the way out for you has come.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Matthew 7:13.
    <br>Jesus said:
    <br>"Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way
    <br>that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it.
    <br>Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life,
    <br>and there are few who find it."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, you are called to follow Jesus".
    <br>To follow Jesus is to follow the way of the Cross
    <br>and Jesus warned us that the way is narrow.
    <br>Why is the way too narrow?
    <br>When you are concentrated on how you are feeling,
    <br>when you are concentrated on how you are doing,
    <br>how you are treated by people, you cannot go that way.
    <br>When we are too much of ourselves, we can't go that narrow way.
    <br>Pride and arrogance cannot go that way.
    <br>Let someone say, "The way has been made plain.
    <br>Neighbour, follow the path of faith and humility."
    <br>Pride is a sin in us by nature.
    <br>We must be cautioned and armed against it, for a man can truly hide his condition,
    <br>his true character, until his pride is injured.
    <br>That is why Jesus said in the Book of Luke 9:23
    <br>that if you must follow Jesus, you must deny yourself.
    <br>You must deny yourself and follow Him.
    <br>Remember, God is love and love is humble.
    <br>Love does not express itself in arrogance, in pride.
    <br>Love is not self-seeking.
    <br>So, if you do not deny yourself, you cannot follow Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, follow the way of the Cross."
    <br>No matter what happens in your home, in your business,
    <br>no matter your circumstance, follow the way of the Cross.
    <br>Jesus is the way to salvation, Jesus is the way to peace, to fulfilment.
    <br>Salvation is a total and complete commitment to Him.
    <br>We are no longer ourselves - we belong to Him.
    <br>You cannot follow Jesus without making a commitment to Him.
    <br>When we are committed to Him, asking Jesus to purchase us,
    <br>we become Christ's property and we become aliens on earth.
    <br>Say, "I am Jesus' property. I belong to Jesus."
    <br>No one can snatch me from His hand.
    <br>Jesus said something to you and me - that if we do not make a commitment,
    <br>we cannot follow Him.
    <br>In Matthew 10:38-39, the Lord says to you and me,
    <br>"Take up your cross daily, deny yourself and follow Me.
    <br>Even if it takes you to be killed for your belief in Christ, if you don't deny yourself,
    <br>if you don't take up your cross, you are not worthy of Me."
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you a true follower of Jesus?"
    <br>What does it take?
    <br>In John 6:54 Jesus spoke to those who followed Him,
    <br>the crowds that thronged around Him, and said to them,
    <br>"If anyone eats My flesh and drinks My Blood,
    <br>he has eternal life and I will raise him on the last day."
    <br>Upon hearing the words of Christ, many turned their backs
    <br>on Jesus and abandoned Him.
    <br>Many left Jesus because they were much around miracles and healings,
    <br>rather than being around Jesus - the Head of the Church, the Healer Himself.
    <br>Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus
    <br>because he was much around Jesus in body but his heart was far from Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, get rid of pride and embrace God's wisdom."
    <br>No matter what you are passing through, don't fight.
    <br>Follow the path of faith, humility and self-denial.
    <br>That is the key.
    <br>Let's look at the lives of biblical characters who followed the path of faith and humility.
    <br>Are you a ruler, a king or a president?
    <br>Remember Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel 4:30.
    <br>The Bible says that the Babylonian King was overwhelmed by his glory.
    <br>One day, seeing the greatness of his empire, he boasted in himself.
    <br>He allocated all the glory to his own power and might.
    <br>Little did he know that he was just a toy in the hands of God,
    <br>who used him as an instrument of judgement to the nations he subdued.
    <br>When he honoured himself above the Lord,
    <br>instant judgement came upon him in Daniel 4:32-38.
    <br>All that he counted dear was stripped away from him:
    <br>his kingdom, his glory, his power, his honour, his mental health were taken away from him.
    <br>The king became mentally sick and became mad
    <br>and lived isolated in the bush for seven years like an animal.
    <br>When we do things in pride and arrogance, we honour ourselves and dishonour God;
    <br>thus we magnify ourselves above the Lord.
    <br>Humbled by his situation, he got to his senses and acknowledged the power
    <br>and sovereignty of God, who gives grace to whom He gives grace
    <br>and mercy to whom He gives mercy.
    <br>And God, who is abounding in mercy, forgave him, restored him back to glory.
    <br>What lesson can we learn from him?
    <br>When we admit our weakness before God,
    <br>all pride and arrogance will be taken away.
    <br>When everything that gives pride in us is taken away, humility comes.
    <br>After being humbled by his situation, Nebuchadnezzar embraced God's wisdom
    <br>and got rid of pride and began to rule in righteousness.
    <br>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
    <br>What is your situation today?
    <br>Run to God.
    <br>What is your trouble?
    <br>What is pressing you down?
    <br>Follow the path of faith and humility because we are undeserving of His grace.
    <br>Let's remember the woman from Canaan in the Book of Matthew 15:21 to the end.
    <br>The Scripture says that faith is our movement towards God
    <br>and faith is not an isolated spiritual force.
    <br>Faith works in conjunction with other spiritual forces: love, humility, patience, perseverance.
    <br>When she came to Jesus, Jesus referred to the woman as a dog in order to test her faith.
    <br>Jesus deliberately provoked her sensibility and sensitivity in order to injure her pride.
    <br>But rather than being offended when Jesus equated her to a dog, she said to the Lord,
    <br>"Yes, Lord, You are right. I know I am undeserving of what You serve on the table.
    <br>Even the little dogs eat their master's crumbs that fall from the table."
    <br>Jesus looked into her heart and saw humility and faith and her request was granted.
    <br>To honour God, we must come to His presence in sincerity and humility of heart
    <br>and acknowledge our position before Jesus as undeserving of His grace.
    <br>To acknowledge our position before God is to admit our weakness,
    <br>our shortcomings and limitations.
    <br>And when we do, the way out has come.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the way out has come!"
    <br>Are you a believer?
    <br>Remember what happened to Paul.
    <br>The Scripture says that those whom Jesus intends to honour, He first humbles them
    <br>in order to prevent them from becoming conceited when the glory,
    <br>when the honour eventually comes.
    <br>Such was the case of Paul.
    <br>He said, "Because of the excellency of revelation of the anointing I carry,
    <br>it was given me a thorn in my flesh so I may not fall into pride."
    <br>Remember what the man of God said in this year 2020 - his prophecy: This is the year of humility.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, this is the year of humility".
    <br>God will humble us with our challenges.
    <br>God can use any foolish thing to test our faith.
    <br>We must understand that our values must be tested against facts and experiences.
    <br>So, what is your thorn?
    <br>What is your trouble?
    <br>What is your problem today?
    <br>That thorn may be to humble you, to strengthen you, to reform you,
    <br>to prepare you for the greater heights.
    <br>Therefore, don't go out of the way.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, no matter what you are passing through, don't go out of the way".
    <br>No matter what you are passing through, don't go out of your duty.
    <br>Stay in your home.
    <br>Stay in your business.
    <br>Stay in your position.
    <br>Follow the path of faith and humility.
    <br>Finally brethren;
    <br>the highest motivation in serving God is the desire to please Him.
    <br>And the Bible says, "Only faith pleases God."
    <br>As faith and humility honour Jesus the most, so Jesus honours faith and humility the most.
    <br>As a Christian, if you see the choice to serve the Lord as your key responsibility in life,
    <br>you should guard against unhealthy ego, pride and greed overruling your good intentions.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, follow the way of the Cross.
    <br>Follow the path of faith and humility."
    <br>How?
    <br>The Scripture says we must take our cross and deny ourselves.
    <br>This means we must learn to forget ourselves.
    <br>We forget ourselves when we choose to do the will of God, rather than our own way.
    <br>As a Christian, as a child of God, a daughter of God,
    <br>you must choose to do what is right every day,
    <br>even though it is contrary to what you naturally want to do.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Say, "The battle is the Lord's.
    <br>The race to survival is not my personal challenge but one with the Lord."
    <br>Say, "The battle is the Lord's.
    <br>The battle belongs to God."
    <br>When we forget ourselves and learn to look to Jesus, humility comes,
    <br>for true humility is total dependence on God for everything.
    <br>When we forget ourselves, we put off the old man and we put on the new man,
    <br>who is renewed in affection, in will, in emotions, and follow the path of faith and humility.
    <br>Are you a follower of Jesus?
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you a follower of Jesus?"
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Are you a follower of Jesus?
    <br>Get rid of offence.
    <br>Let offence go.
    <br>Release forgiveness and the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
