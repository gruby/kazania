  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>You can see Prophet T.B. Joshua on the stage.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He has decided not to talk but to express his feelings and that of genuine Africans
    <br>and the world at large through this song you are about to listen to.
    <br>So sit back and listen to this song with all your heart.
    <br>Africa, unite!
    <br>Don't let fellow Africans feel unwelcome in our land.
    <br>Africa, unite!
