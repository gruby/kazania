  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "You are welcome to the Arena of Liberty".
    <br>Say it with joy, "You are welcome to the Arena of Liberty".
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we welcome you to the Arena of Liberty.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>The Bible says in the Book of Psalms 133:
    <br>Behold how wonderful, how pleasant it is when brethren dwell together in harmony,
    <br>for there the Lord pronounced His blessings - even life forevermore.
    <br>Yes, once again, you are welcome to the Arena of Liberty, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You may be seated, in the presence of God.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>There is something that the devil will not like you to do right now -
    <br>it is to be happy even when there is nothing to be happy about.
    <br>I want you to look straight to your neighbour and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>regardless of my situation, regardless of what life might bring, God is what I need Him to be."
    <br>Say, "God is what I need Him to be."
    <br>Are you sure God is what you need Him to be?
    <br>Good.
    <br>I want to ask you a question.
    <br>When is the best time to love God?
    <br>You can give me a "chorus answer".
    <br>When is the best time to love God?
    <br>Is it when the food is on the table?
    <br>Is it when money is in your pocket?
    <br>Is it when breakthrough, freedom, good health is before you?
    <br>No!
    <br>The best time to love God is when life seems to make no sense to us,
    <br>when we do not understand our situation.
    <br>You love God when you love nothing in comparison to Him but in reference to Him alone.
    <br>I mean, when you are ready to give up your comfort,
    <br>to do or suffer anything in order to glorify and please Him.
    <br>The Bible says in the Book of Job 1:20-22
    <br>that Job's tests prove that Christians can love God for who He is, not for what He gives.
    <br>I don't know the situation that you are facing this morning
    <br>but always remember:
    <br>Christians can love God for who He is, not for what He gives.
    <br>Do you love God for who He is or for what He gives?
    <br>Many today think that trusting in Christ Jesus prevents them from trouble.
    <br>As such, when calamity comes - trials and persecution -
    <br>they begin to question God's goodness and justice.
    <br>The same Job 2:10 advises us not to give up on God when He allows us to have bad experiences,
    <br>but rather love Him the more.
    <br>Let someone say, "Love Him the more".
    <br>Love Him the more and see your challenges as an opportunity to honour God before men.
    <br>Are you frustrated because your prayers are not being answered the way you want
    <br>or you have been depressed because your plans are not working out?
    <br>Perhaps you are loosing your relationship, health, finances, career...
    <br>I want to urge you this morning to trust God even when life seems to make no sense to you.
    <br>The Bible says in the Book of Proverbs 3:5-6:
    <br>Trust God even when you do not understand your situation.
    <br>When you express absolute faith in Christ Jesus, His duty is to raise us from death to life,
    <br>from darkness to light.
    <br>This brings me to the title of this message for you this morning, brethren:
    <br>TRUST GOD EVEN WHEN LIFE SEEMS TO MAKE NO SENSE
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Trust God even when life seems to make no sense".
    <br>Trust Him!
    <br>I cannot hear you - trust Him!
    <br>Knowing God is not only about seeing His works, His miracles or hearing His testimonies
    <br>but learning His ways.
    <br>We have listened to so many testimonies of the power of God.
    <br>Knowing God is not only to see His works, His miracles or hear His testimonies
    <br>but about learning His ways.
    <br>We can learn His ways through His Word and by His Spirit.
    <br>Without the help of the Holy Spirit, one may show great zeal out of mere conviction
    <br>that Jesus is the Healer, the Deliverer, the Blessing Provider.
    <br>However, it takes the grace of God to maintain one's confession, one's stand in Christ Jesus
    <br>when the heat - I mean the vicissitudes and storms of life - comes with its choking hands.
    <br>Today, it matters to many, if the Lord does not answer their prayer.
    <br>People of God, hold fast to your confidence in God's Word when your faith is tested.
    <br>What is my confidence in God's Word?
    <br>He is my Healer, whether He heals me or not.
    <br>He is my Deliverer, whether He delivers me or not.
    <br>That should be your confidence in God's Word - He never fails, come rain or shine.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is important for us to know, brethren, that God sometimes does not take us on a straight line.
    <br>There might, in fact, there will be storms, false accusations, name-calling,
    <br>disappointments, even delay.
    <br>They are part of His plan.
    <br>Nevertheless, God is what you need Him to be.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God is what I need Him to be".
    <br>Such was the principle behind the ordeals of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
    <br>in the Book of Daniel 3.
    <br>The Bible says that these three great heroes had every reason to shift their ground
    <br>when their faith was tested.
    <br>By today's standard, they were men of authority, position, possession,
    <br>they had wealth, they had everything.
    <br>The Bible says they were in charge of all the affairs of province in Babylon,
    <br>after the interpretation of king Nebuchadnezzar's dream
    <br>but when their faith was tested they had all reason to compromise their faith.
    <br>However, they didn't even mind loosing their position.
    <br>The Bible says that in the face of all odds, they stood their ground,
    <br>knowing that God is faithful to those who are faithful to Him.
    <br>I want you all to turn with me in your Bible to the Book of Daniel 3
    <br>and that will be our proof text for this message.
    <br>Say, "Trust God even when life seems to make no sense".
    <br>Let's open our Bibles in the Book of Daniel;
    <br>that will be in the Old Testament, after the Book of Ezekiel.
    <br>Let us take our reading from verse 12.
    <br>Now, some men came to the king saying:
    <br>"There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon:
    <br>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have not paid due regard to you.
    <br>They do not serve your gods or worship the gold image which you have set up.
    <br>Then Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury,
    <br>gave the command to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego.
    <br>So they brought these men before the king.
    <br>Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them,
    <br>'Is it true Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego, that you do not serve my gods
    <br>or worship the gold image which I have set up?
    <br>Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery,
    <br>in symphony with all kinds of music,
    <br>and you fall down and worship the image which I have made, good!
    <br>But if you do not worship,
    <br>you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
    <br>And who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?'
    <br>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king,
    <br>'O, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.
    <br>If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace,
    <br>and He will deliver us from your hand, O king.
    <br>But, if not..."
    <br>Listen to that - that is the main of our proof texts here today - verse 18.
    <br>"But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods,
    <br>nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.' "
    <br>Take note of verse 18.
    <br>But if our God did not rescue us,
    <br>let it be known to you, O king, that we are not going to serve your god, or worship your image.
    <br>I want you all to put yourself in the position of these three men.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>The Bible says that they were faced with options that required the grace of God
    <br>to make the right choice,
    <br>yet they knew that they needed God in death and the transition of their souls.
    <br>The Bible says that they trusted God and they were determined to be faithful
    <br>regardless of the consequences.
    <br>When you are faced with situations that suggest no hope or no future,
    <br>always remember that it honours God to believe Him even when every sense contradicts Him.
    <br>The Bible says that because these great heroes of faith honoured God,
    <br>God honoured them before men.
    <br>Brethren, you will not be practicing a true faith, until you come to the point of belief...
    <br>Let's say: if he does not get better, you will serve Him better...
    <br>I don't know your situation.
    <br>You will not be practicing true faith, until you come to a point of belief and say:
    <br>even if he does not get better, I will serve You better.
    <br>Maybe no job, you are looking for the fruit of the womb,
    <br>or you have been robbed of your appointment,
    <br>persecution "left and right, back and front",
    <br>yet you say: even if he does not get better, I will love You better.
    <br>When the Lord sees that you don't have to have it,
    <br>He will give you back what you are willing to give up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When the Lord sees that you don't have to have it, your focus is on Him, the Giver
    <br>and not the blessings He gives,
    <br>He will give you back what you are willing to give up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Remember, it is essential to base our relationship on the Deliverer and not the deliverance itself;
    <br>to base our relationship on the Healer and not the healing itself.
    <br>I know we are in the presence of God for different things, but remember,
    <br>whatever you are here for, in His presence to receive,
    <br>it is more essential to base your relationship on the Giver of those blessings
    <br>and not on the blessings He gives.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you can stop, brethren, asking for that particular thing
    <br>that oftentimes causes you to question your faith in God,
    <br>if you can stop asking for that particular desire
    <br>that oftentimes makes your faith to waiver,
    <br>God will give you when you least expect it.
    <br>He will give back to you what you are willing to give up.
    <br>It is important for us to trust God even when our sight is beholding a different reality -
    <br>trust His reality.
    <br>When you express the genuine faith, He will reveal His mighty power.
    <br>The Book of Genesis 22 reminds us how faithful Abraham was to God
    <br>even when sacrificing Isaac seemed to make no sense to him.
    <br>The Bible says he trusted God that even if he killed Isaac,
    <br>that same God would raise him from death in order to fulfill His promises.
    <br>Let someone say, "Our God is faithful to fulfill all His promises."
    <br>Say, "It doesn't matter how long (it takes) - He will fulfill it".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, trust God even when you do not understand.
    <br>Today we say we trust God but our trust is nothing but conditional.
    <br>We trust God that He is the Healer, when He heals us.
    <br>We believe He is the blessings Provider, when all our debts are paid.
    <br>We believe He is the Deliverer, when He delivers us from the bondage of sin.
    <br>Many today base their relationship with God on conditions, "If only. Unless He.
    <br>If only I am healed, then I will believe there are miracles.
    <br>If I'm not prayed for today, I will not come back."
    <br>Stop being a conditional Christian.
    <br>God is not one of those things but the only Thing.
    <br>Let someone say, "Trust God".
    <br>Trust God even when you do not understand.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing, people of God,
    <br>that same power that rescued Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego is available to you today.
    <br>That same power is the one that raised our Saviour from the dead.
    <br>He is available to meet all your needs today, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That same grace, that same power that rescued Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
    <br>will rescue you today, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Finally brethren, let's turn our Bible to the Book of James 1; after the Book of Hebrews...
    <br>Let's quickly take our reading from verse 5.
    <br>"If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach,
    <br>and it will be given to him.
    <br>But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea
    <br>driven and tossed by the wind.
    <br>For let that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
    <br>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."
    <br>In this passage, brethren, we learn He is pained when we doubt Him.
    <br>He is pleased when we believe in Him.
    <br>Therefore, when you ask, brethren, viewers all over the world,
    <br>let your trust, your hope, your faith, your confidence be in Him
    <br>and not the blessing you seek.
    <br>If you believe Him as the Saviour,
    <br>you must have confidence in His ability to save you, to rescue you.
    <br>No matter what comes, no matter what happens, from that confidence comes patience,
    <br>perseverance, endurance and forbearance for a better future.
    <br>Brethren, you may be physically stressed,
    <br>when you look around, you see discouragement, pain...
    <br>You may be emotionally stressed but do not be spiritually stressed.
    <br>Let someone say, "Do not be spiritually stressed."
    <br>Because if you are, you will lose focus on God, you will act out of character,
    <br>perhaps faint in your faith and begin to seek alternatives to God.
    <br>As you move closer to God by hearing and obeying His Word,
    <br>you will find strength to trust Him and your faith will grow stronger.
    <br>God's love is total, not partial.
    <br>His love is unending.
    <br>The Bible says it is deep; it banishes all discouragement, despair,
    <br>name-calling, even death.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, those who are under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>I pray that the Holy Spirit will fill every aspect of your life to the fullest,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let someone say, "Trust God!"
    <br>Say, "I will trust God beyond now, beyond my good times, beyond my hard times."
    <br>That should be your confidence - that Jesus Christ is eternally with you
    <br>and He will fulfill every one of His promises to you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Allow this Word of God, brethren, to guide you to a new life
    <br>and the attitude you develop from this day
    <br>will ultimately determine how your great future works out.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of your heart.
    <br>Let someone say, "I will trust God even when I do not understand!
    <br>I will trust God even when life seems to make not sense!"
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
