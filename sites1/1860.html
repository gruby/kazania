  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Happy Birthday in advance!
    <br>I know that is what is going on in your mind immediately you see me on the screen.
    <br>I can't wait to hear from God how to celebrate our birthday. 
    <br>It is our birthday. Thank you!
    <br>Give me your heart.
    <br>Don't forget our heart is the communication point, contact point for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Let me have your time.
    <br>Time with Jesus is time well spent.
    <br>Thank you, viewers.
    <br>I want to take you to the Book we need to read today:
    <br>1 Corinthians 12 verse 3, but I will take my reading from verse 1:
    <br>"And now, dear brothers and sisters, I will write about the special abilities the Holy Spirit gives to each of us,
    <br>for I must correct your misunderstandings about them.
    <br>You know that when you were still pagans, you were led astray
    <br>and swept along in worshipping speechless idols.
    <br>So I want you to know how to discern what is truly from God:
    <br>No one speaking by the Spirit of God can curse Jesus,
    <br>and no one is able to say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit."
    <br>Viewers, other Books that will help you for more understanding -
    <br>you will find in the Book of Ephesians 1:16-18, Matthew 15:8, 1 Corinthians 2:7-13, and Luke 24:45.
    <br>As we go, we will continue to give you some Books that will help you.
    <br>Viewers, live a life of victory as a Christian.
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 12:3, no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>No one can say he is a real Christian without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>No one can say he is a real born-again without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Today, how many of us seek the attention of the Holy Spirit before calling the name Jesus?
    <br>How many of us seek the attention of the Holy Spirit while counselling, teaching, preaching, praying?
    <br>Viewers, the door is closed and we need the key to open it.
    <br>Can you open the door without a key?
    <br>That is the position of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>There is darkness everywhere. 
    <br>We are in the world but not part of it.
    <br>There is darkness everywhere.
    <br>Can you walk in darkness - without light?
    <br>That is the position of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Spirit lightens the Word.
    <br>The Word will remain on our lips without the Spirit.
    <br>I mean, you will only hear yourself and others will hear you while praying, preaching, teaching;
    <br>God will not hear you without the Spirit.
    <br>The Word will remain inactive, meaningless and oftentimes destructive without the Spirit.
    <br>It's not by power
    <br>It's not by might
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>That is why Jesus said in John 6:63: "The words I speak to you are Spirit and they are life."
    <br>God's Word speaks about His promises, while the Spirit executes them.
    <br>Viewers, let us pray.
    <br>I pray you have a hearing heart.
    <br>Begin to have a hearing heart.
    <br>Begin to receive a hearing heart -
    <br>a heart that does not bear grudges, a heart that is humble,
    <br>a heart that is sincere, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers, to take Jesus' name into our day is to take the Living Word of God.
    <br>Christ and the Living Word are one.
    <br>This suggests that the Word of God is the expression of Christ's character.
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 2:7-13,
    <br>which I mentioned earlier on, and Luke 24:45,
    <br>the Holy Spirit is more interested in what we do secretly - I mean, privately.
    <br>Whatever we do secretly and privately will determine what we can do in the name of Jesus.
    <br>The one you serve in secret, in private will stand with you in the open.
    <br>The one you serve in secret, in private will stand to reward you in the open.
    <br>Viewers, we are more of His friend in the open but more of His enemy in secret and in private.
    <br>Here we find ourselves today.
    <br>The way we are living our lives - we find it today.
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Lord Jesus, they are empty vessels that need to be filled.
    <br>Fill them, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Fill them with your faithfulness, holiness, obedience, humility!
    <br>Fill them, Lord, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>They are empty vessels that need to be filled.
    <br>Fill them, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Lord Jesus, they are weak in the faith; strengthen them, Lord, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Strengthen them, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Lord Jesus, strengthen their faith and trust in You!
    <br>Strengthen their faith and trust in You!
    <br>Strengthen their faith and trust in You, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, think through them till Your ideas are their ideas.
    <br>Think through them, Lord, till Your ideas are their ideas, in Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>'Amen' means it is done.
    <br>Viewers, 'Amen' means it is done.
    <br>That is why we must say 'Amen' with all our heart.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Because God has spoken His Word: 'Amen!'
    <br>Because He has settled it in Heaven: 'Amen!'
    <br>Because He has given it to you, what you want - blessing - your prayer is answered: 'Amen!'
    <br>Because He has given it to you, that is why you say, 'Amen!'
    <br>'Amen' is a statement of confirmation and must be said with conviction, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name, Amen!
