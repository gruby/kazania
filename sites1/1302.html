    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>It is a privilege to be here in your midst today in the presence of God
    <br>to share the life changing, light giving Word of God.
    <br>My name is Brother Chris, I'm from the UK
    <br>and I have the incredible privilege to have Prophet T.B. Joshua as a mentor
    <br>and that's the reason I'm here in your midst today to share the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and ask your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, how are you?"
    <br>You can respond to your neighbour, "How are you?"
    <br>I hope you are fine.
    <br>Good.
    <br>Now more important question.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, how is your heart?"
    <br>You can answer the question to your neighbour, "How is your heart?"
    <br>I hope your heart is fine.
    <br>If your heart is fine, everything else will align in God's time.
    <br>Your heart is the real man.
    <br>That is what really matters.
    <br>The reason we stress and emphasize so much about the heart
    <br>is that God speaks to our hearts, not to our ears.
    <br>We hear in the church, "God, speak to me. Lord, I want to hear from You.
    <br>I want to hear Your opinion, Your direction, Your revelation to my life."
    <br>God is not going to speak to your ears in a loud booming voice,
    <br>"My son, don't go there!" - no.
    <br>He is going to speak where?
    <br>Your heart!
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>The question is not whether God is speaking to us; God takes care of His children.
    <br>God speaks to us, He gives to us His instruction, His direction, His revelation.
    <br>The question is, are you listening to Him?
    <br>Are you sensitive to His voice?
    <br>Are you in tune with Him?
    <br>Or is there a connection problem?
    <br>You know what I mean by 'connection problem'?
    <br>Have you ever had a phone call with someone and the network was so bad
    <br>that you could not hear what the person was saying?
    <br>Has that ever happened to anyone? If it has happened to you, raise your hand.
    <br>It is very frustrating.
    <br>You want to have a conversation with someone but the line is so bad,
    <br>you can't hear what the person is saying, the person can't hear what you are saying,
    <br>instead of a conversation, you end up with frustration.
    <br>Now I want to give you a very quick example.
    <br>This is a true story about a phone call I received.
    <br>In my life I have never had such a strange conversation because the network was so bad.
    <br>I was not hearing him, he was not hearing me.
    <br>Let me give you an idea of what the conversation looked like.
    <br>- Hello. This is Emmanuel TV prayer line. How can we help you?
    <br>- Hello...
    <br>- Yes, sir. I'm hearing you, sir. This is Emmanuel TV. How can we help you?
    <br>- Is this Emmanuel... Hello.
    <br>- Yes. This is Emmanuel TV prayer line. How can we help you, sir?
    <br>- My name is... Hello.
    <br>- Your name is Hello? What's the problem, sir? What do you need prayer for?
    <br>- I'm calling you from... Hello.
    <br>There is a country called Hello?
    <br>This was a real conversation.
    <br>- OK, sir. Please tell me, what is it that you would like prayer for today.
    <br>- Can I speak to Prophet... Hello.
    <br>- Prophet Hello?
    <br>- Sir, this is the Emmanuel TV prayer line. The man of God has sent evangelists to pray for you.
    <br>What's the problem?
    <br>- I have the problem of... Hello.
    <br>- I can see you have the problem of hello, sir, but what is it that you would like prayer for?
    <br>- I need deliverance.
    <br>- The deliverance from what, sir?
    <br>- I have the spirit of... Hello.
    <br>At this point I took matters into my own hands.
    <br>I said, "Right now, in the name of Jesus Christ - you spirit of hello, I command you to get out!
    <br>Come out of him right now!"
    <br>Do you know what the man said?
    <br>No, he didn't say 'Hello', he said 'Amen'.
    <br>That was the first time he heard me, when I commanded the spirit of hello out.
    <br>And after that, the line cut.
    <br>This is a true story.
    <br>Now why am I telling you this story?
    <br>Because the connection was so bad, the conversation ended up in frustration.
    <br>How is your connection?
    <br>How is your connection point?
    <br>As I told you: God speaks to our hearts, not our ears.
    <br>Bur for many people today, the place where God speaks to us, there is a network problem.
    <br>Something is blocking; something is hindering.
    <br>Something is holding us back from hearing His voice, His instruction.
    <br>And this is what I'm going to address today.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says the human spirit, when free, is sensitive to the Spirit of God
    <br>but when bound and burdened, it loses sensitivity and becomes useless as an instrument.
    <br>This will bring us to the title of today's message:
    <br>BOUND AND BURDENED
    <br>We want to address what is causing your spirit to be locked up,
    <br>what is binding your spirit, your heart and burdening your spirit.
    <br>Turn with me in your Bible to the Book of Mark, chapter 4.
    <br>I'm going to read from verse 14.
    <br>What I'm reading here is Jesus Christ's explanation concerning the parable of the sower.
    <br>It is a very well known parable - I'm sure you are familiar with it.
    <br>This is the explanation of the parable of the sower.
    <br>There is a particular verse that I believe identifies the heart of the human dilemma.
    <br>From verse 14:
    <br>"The farmer sows the word.
    <br>Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown.
    <br>As soon as they hear it, satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.
    <br>Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.
    <br>But since they have no root, they last only a short time.
    <br>When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
    <br>Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;
    <br>but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things
    <br>come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.
    <br>Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop -
    <br>some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown."
    <br>Now first of all, I want you to learn a lesson here.
    <br>Anytime the Word is preached, the Word of God lights and lands in different hearts.
    <br>Our hearts are not the same; as such, the way we receive or resist the message differs.
    <br>That is why a preacher should not get carried away by the reaction of the crowd,
    <br>how loud you clap or how much you shout.
    <br>You say, "Amen, brother! Preach it, pastor!"
    <br>Does your heart say this?
    <br>If your heart receives this truth, your life will reflect this truth.
    <br>It is not a matter of hand agreement; it is a matter of heart agreement.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Heart agreement."
    <br>So please, don't just give me your hands and clap and applaud -
    <br>give me your hearts so that your life will reflect this message.
    <br>Once again, verse 19:
    <br>"... the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in
    <br>and choke the word, making it unfruitful."
    <br>This summarises what causes our hearts to be bound and burdened.
    <br>Let's just take it one by one.
    <br>The worries of this life - worry, worry, worry!
    <br>We are living in a world full of worries; the list of worries is endless.
    <br>You see people worrying about their health, future, education, today's politics,
    <br>their children, their finances, their stature - worry, worry, worry!
    <br>But the truth, brethren, is that:
    <br>It is not the condition you are in that causes you worry but the condition of your heart.
    <br>Worry is caused by what you give your heart to, what you set your heart on
    <br>because in this world there will be trouble.
    <br>In life there is trouble.
    <br>That's life - there is nothing you can do about it.
    <br>In life there is going to be trouble, ups and downs.
    <br>Don't give your heart to that trouble.
    <br>That's what Jesus Christ said in John 16:33,
    <br>'In this world there will be trouble but take heart; I have overcome.'
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>Take hold of your heart; don't give your heart to trouble.
    <br>Don't magnify your trouble above God because that is when it will lead you to worry,
    <br>fear, anxiety, depression, seeking alternatives - all of which burden your spirit.
    <br>Look, this is life; in life not everyone is going to speak good about you.
    <br>People will speak good about you, people will speak evil about you.
    <br>People will praise you, people will condemn you.
    <br>Don't let it go to your heart.
    <br>Don't give your heart to people's opinion of you; that's life.
    <br>Woe to you if all men speak well of you.
    <br>This is life.
    <br>Whatever you place above God in your heart becomes a burden -
    <br>weighs your spirit down, makes your heart heavy.
    <br>Whatever you place above God in your heart...
    <br>When your heart is heavy, you can't be sensitive to His voice,
    <br>you can't be in tune for prayer.
    <br>When your heart is heavy, you will find that little things can irritate you,
    <br>overwhelm you, cause you agitation.
    <br>You find yourself acting under tension and pressure because your heart is burdened.
    <br>I remember a couple of years ago Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying for a lady in the prayer line.
    <br>The lady had a placard that said, "Difficulty in walking due to knee pain."
    <br>But this lady was huge, she was very very big, very very fat.
    <br>So the man of God prayed for her and she stood up and started walking but she was walking slowly.
    <br>The man of God stopped her and said, "Madam, look, you are healed
    <br>but if you want to enjoy your healing, go and lose some weight."
    <br>He said, "If you don't reduce your weight, the pressure on your knees will be too much.
    <br>And no amount of prayer in the name of Jesus will reduce that pressure,
    <br>unless you remove the weight."
    <br>You see the principle here?
    <br>You have to remove the weight in order to reduce the pressure.
    <br>Many of us are acting under tension and pressure because our hearts are burdened,
    <br>our hearts are heavy and our spirits are locked up.
    <br>This is affecting our Christian walk - our walk with the Lord.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says, we that walk with the Lord
    <br>run the straight race through God's good grace.
    <br>But if your heart is bound and burdened, how can you run your race?
    <br>Let me use a very practical, clear-cut example to demonstrate this.
    <br>Can I get two people from the audience - but please - two young men.
    <br>This example requires some physical activity.
    <br>Two young men - if God puts it in your heart, just come out.
    <br>Two young men.
    <br>OK, I'm seeing one coming out, and there is another one. OK, thank you very much.
    <br>One, two.
    <br>Very simple example - I'm trying to prove to you and explain to you
    <br>the danger of your heart being burdened.
    <br>OK, sir, you stand this way.
    <br>Sir, you come here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I hope you are ready. I know you didn't come to church for athletics,
    <br>you came to church for your spiritual life.
    <br>But just for this example, the two of you are going to race.
    <br>My brother, you are running this way, my brother, you are running this way.
    <br>First person here wins.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Get yourself ready.
    <br>Hold on.
    <br>Usain Bolt, hold on.
    <br>Three, two, one, go!
    <br>Winner!
    <br>Congratulations my brother, he is the winner.
    <br>Well done, don't go yet, come.
    <br>You still have another chance, my brother.
    <br>My brother was able to run efficiently, effectively, nothing was holding him down,
    <br>nothing was burdening him.
    <br>Take your position again.
    <br>Let's change the equation a little bit here.
    <br>Let's change the equation a little bit.
    <br>I'm going to do something - a little of an equation change.
    <br>My brother, put on this backpack, put it on your back.
    <br>Right.
    <br>It is time to weigh my brother down.
    <br>Do you see this?
    <br>This is worry.
    <br>Look, it doesn't end there.
    <br>You see this?
    <br>This is fear.
    <br>Oh no, it doesn't end there.
    <br>You see this?
    <br>This is depression.
    <br>I hope you are OK, my brother.
    <br>Alright, you see this?
    <br>This is low self esteem.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I can't even close the bag, it's so heavy.
    <br>Now let's repeat the race.
    <br>Let's see if there is going to be any difference now.
    <br>Let's see who is going to win this one.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Three, two, one, go!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Come, we are not finished yet, come back.
    <br>Who won the race?
    <br>The brother without the burden.
    <br>Come back; we are still going to continue this race.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm sorry my brother - it is all for your good.
    <br>Do you know the painful thing about this?
    <br>I will tell you.
    <br>For many of us today, our burden has taken our eyes off Jesus.
    <br>We face a burden, something holds us back, holds us down -
    <br>we try to solve the problem without God.
    <br>We try to remove the weight without God.
    <br>We try to lighten the load without God
    <br>and instead of helping the situation, we go from burden to bondage.
    <br>Let me give you an example.
    <br>Let's just say my brother has been sent a threatening text message that says,
    <br>"I'm going to deal with you and your family."
    <br>And he is afraid - fear is a burden.
    <br>And he thinks to himself, "What am I going to do?
    <br>There is a friend who told me if I joined the society, they can protect me.
    <br>Let me go and join the society."
    <br>Perhaps you hear about a spiritualist; they say they give you something,
    <br>you put it in your pocket, it will protect you, nobody can hit you,
    <br>even if they hit you, it will not penetrate - you put it in our pocket.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>You have gone from the burden of fear to the bondage of witchcraft.
    <br>You thought you would remove the fear, you have only made matters worse!
    <br>Another example; maybe some of us are depressed,
    <br>we are busy thinking someone disappointed us,
    <br>we are busy giving our heart to that disappointment, "How can they do this to me?
    <br>How can they say this about me?"
    <br>Because of that disappointment, depression, you say, "What can I do?
    <br>Let me go out and enjoy myself.
    <br>Let me go and take alcohol. Let me go and try drugs, marijuana, cocaine, meth."
    <br>What has happened?
    <br>You have gone from the burden of depression to the bondage of addiction.
    <br>Just a simple thing like offence.
    <br>Someone speaks against you, said something wrongfully against you and your heart is pained.
    <br>You begin to focus on the wrong done to you.
    <br>You think about, "How can they do this to me? How can they say this about me?"
    <br>You think to yourself, "The only way I can feel better is to get revenge.
    <br>They should suffer the way I'm suffering.
    <br>They should feel the pain the way I'm feeling the pain."
    <br>You begin to plot and plan how you can get back to that person.
    <br>You have gone from the burden of offence to the bondage of anger.
    <br>Some of us may have a low self esteem.
    <br>We isolate ourselves, we feel that people don't like us, we feel we are not good enough,
    <br>we are not strong enough, we are not smart enough, not intelligent or beautiful enough.
    <br>Low self esteem, inferiority complex - what happens?
    <br>You say, "Let me go on the internet and watch something that will satisfy me
    <br>and remove my heart from this."
    <br>You sit down, watch pornography, you end up masturbating.
    <br>You think you have been enjoying yourself.
    <br>What has happened?
    <br>You have gone from the burden of inferiority to the bondage of lust.
    <br>Your heart is bound and burdened.
    <br>Do you know what happened?
    <br>It is just like this.
    <br>Brother, just come; help me hold this.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Already he is weighed down, now he is tied up.
    <br>It doesn't just end there, let me put another one.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your heart is burdened and now you have given satan the permission to chain you.
    <br>You have given him the right to lock you up, to tie you down.
    <br>I wonder what's going to happen in the race now.
    <br>I wonder what is going to happen.
    <br>Let's give it a go.
    <br>This time we just race to here.
    <br>Three, two, one, go!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many of our Christian lives look like this.
    <br>We are stuck, we are stagnant, we are not moving, we are struggling
    <br>but nothing seems to be working.
    <br>We go to church, we pray, we fast but our heart is bound and burdened.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me tell you this truth, people of God:
    <br>Satan cannot remove a burden he created; satan cannot loosen a chain he fastened.
    <br>Some of us have this wrong impression; you say, "I want to fight fire with fire."
    <br>You want to fight envy with pride.
    <br>You want to fight malice with jealousy.
    <br>You want to fight anger with lust.
    <br>You don't realise that they have the same father, they come from the same source.
    <br>Satan is the author of bondage; he cannot bring freedom.
    <br>Satan is the author of division; he cannot bring unity.
    <br>Satan is the author of pain; he cannot bring peace.
    <br>Only Jesus can set you free!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can't find freedom in the world.
    <br>No one can remove this burden, no one can cut these chains.
    <br>Only Jesus can cut the chains, only Jesus can loose the burden,
    <br>only Jesus can remove the pain, only Jesus can give you peace - only Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What Jesus does is very simple.
    <br>You just give Him the opportunity; what does He do?
    <br>He sets you free.
    <br>What does Jesus say?
    <br>Jesus says, 'Come unto Me all you who are weary and heavy-laden and I will give you rest.'
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>That does not mean that we cannot have trouble.
    <br>That doesn't mean that people won't speak evil about us.
    <br>That doesn't mean that there cannot be hardships.
    <br>But it means you are not alone.
    <br>You and Him are working together; you and Him are facing the battle together.
    <br>You and Him are fighting the battle together; you and Him are lifting the load together.
    <br>You and Him are facing the persecution together.
    <br>You are sharing in His ability, sharing in His strength.
    <br>As you bless God in your trials, you will be blessed by God through your trials.
    <br>Please, put your hands together for our two brothers.
    <br>My brother, come.
    <br>Come and take an altar fruit
    <br>to thank God for the wonderful demonstration.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I know the guy has been preparing for this moment, "This is the fruit I will pick".
    <br>He already prepared it in advance.
    <br>God bless you, my brother.
    <br>People of God, are you with me?
    <br>I hope you understand what we are talking about.
    <br>That Scripture - let's read it again, verse 19 in chapter 4 says:
    <br>"... the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth..." - the things of this world, desires -
    <br>this is the deception.
    <br>Satan has perverted our minds and polluted our hearts to such a degree
    <br>that we think what will bring us freedom actually puts us in bondage.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity especially to speak to young people around the world.
    <br>Young people, please listen to this.
    <br>Many of us are bound by the chains we call freedom.
    <br>You say, "I want to be free", you want to rebel from your parents,
    <br>you say, "Let me go out and enjoy the things of the world.
    <br>I want to experiment with this.
    <br>Let's try some drugs, some alcohol, I want to try this, do this, go there, be free.
    <br>I don't want people to restrict me."
    <br>What you think is freedom is actually putting you in bondage.
    <br>For many of our generation today,
    <br>satan does not even have to worry about planning and plotting your destruction
    <br>because you are using your own hands to damage your own destiny.
    <br>You are using your own feet to fight your own future.
    <br>You can't enjoy satan's food without being contaminated by his poison.
    <br>You can't drink satan's wine without being exposed to his venom.
    <br>We sacrifice our future for the sake of trying to be free.
    <br>Psalm 55:22 simply says:
    <br>"Cast your burdens on the Lord, and He shall sustain you..."
    <br>Hebrews 4:3 says, "For we who have believed enter into rest."
    <br>If we truly believe, our hearts will be at rest.
    <br>Ask yourself right now, check yourself right now:
    <br>Is your heart at rest?
    <br>You can know yourself.
    <br>If your heart is restless and uneasy, if you are afraid of this or that,
    <br>if you are struggling with your own efforts,
    <br>it shows you have not yet believed.
    <br>Many of us have come to church to pray over a certain problem, issue arising in our life,
    <br>yet afterwards we go back home and we are still worried, anxious, distressed,
    <br>as if we never prayed at all.
    <br>The Bible says when you believe, you will be at rest.
    <br>When we believe, we will no longer worry, we will be like a child,
    <br>resting in the arms of their parents, their mother, their father.
    <br>As a picture of us Christians, the storms can be raging around,
    <br>the winds and the rains swirling around but we are resting in the arms of our Father.
    <br>If we commit our ways and our works to God,
    <br>He has promised to carry us in the arms of His power and strengthen our spirits by His Spirit.
    <br>Why do we waste so much time reliving things that cannot be changed,
    <br>worrying about things we have no control over?
    <br>Can worry add a second to your life?
    <br>This is satan's tactic - keeping us in this web of deception, this cycle of life,
    <br>guilty about our past, worried about our presence, fearful about our future.
    <br>Don't listen to his lies.
    <br>You are a child of God.
    <br>You don't need to be bound by the pain of the past or burdened by the fear of the future.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, I am a child of God.
    <br>My sins are forgiven so I am not guilty about the past.
    <br>God is with me so I am not worried about the present.
    <br>Heaven is my home so I am not fearful about the future."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So brethren, to round up this message,
    <br>I want to share with you a valuable lesson.
    <br>In this ministry I have been privileged to travel to several countries around the world for crusades
    <br>with Prophet T.B. Joshua and I had the privilege of meeting people and they share their problems,
    <br>their situations, challenges that they want prayer for.
    <br>On one trip I have realised, irrespective of country or culture or colour,
    <br>problems the people face all over the world...
    <br>Let me tell you a very simple but valuable truth.
    <br>As you are busy somewhere praying for what someone has,
    <br>someone is busy somewhere praying for what you have.
    <br>You see poor people today praying, "God, bless me, give me riches."
    <br>Do you know there are some rich people praying right now praying,
    <br>"God, take these riches away if I can have good health."
    <br>Why am I saying this, brethren?
    <br>1 Timothy 6:6-7:
    <br>"But godliness with contentment is great gain.
    <br>For we brought nothing into this world, and we can take nothing out of it."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you know the greatest blessing anyone could pray for?
    <br>Peace of heart.
    <br>For you to be able to put your head on the pillow at night and sleep with peace,
    <br>not having to take medications to force yourself to sleep,
    <br>or to sit there counting the stars because you are so worried and burdened and anxious.
    <br>When you go to bed thinking about what people are saying about you,
    <br>thinking about your situation, thinking, thinking, thinking...
    <br>If there is any blessing you should seek now, it is peace of heart.
    <br>How do we receive this?
    <br>Cast your burdens upon Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In conclusion, brethren:
    <br>Instead of worrying over our cares, turn them into prayers.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>instead of worrying over your cares, turn them into prayers."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Worry is a thief; robs us of joy, peace, hope - it is a thief.
    <br>What would you do if you found that a thief had entered your environment - what would you do?
    <br>You found a thief - you would quickly raise the alarm,
    <br>quickly alert the authorities, "There is a thief here!"
    <br>Why then when worry knocks on the door of our heart do we dignify its presence with our attention?
    <br>If worry tries to infiltrate your heart, what do you do?
    <br>You go to the higher authority, and alert the higher authority - Jesus.
    <br>Quickly go to Him!
    <br>The best remedy against anxiety is to cast our burdens upon God
    <br>for His divine will, will calm our spirits.
    <br>So brethren, get ready for God's visitation today.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, get ready for God's visitation today.
    <br>God will visit your life today but please, take note:
    <br>He is not going to visit your flesh; He is going to visit your heart.
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>Is it bound? Is is burdened?
    <br>Will you receive Him or resist Him?
    <br>One thing is clear: If your heart receives this truth, your life will reflect this truth.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
