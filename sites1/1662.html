  <p>    
    <br>Madam, what can I do for you?
    <br>I need deliverance.
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>My wife and I have been delivered so far as the man of God saw us today.
    <br>There is a depression in their home that leads to thoughts of suicide.
    <br>Yes, exactly.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Sometimes you become moody.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>When you get moody, you think of committing suicide, "I want to die."
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is a trace of generational curses.
    <br>Let's go.
    <br>After the deliverance, that thought will find its way.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>No, no, no...
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>[God with us!]
    <br>That's good.
    <br>I'm Nwankwo Olga, I come from Moscow, Russia.
    <br>This is my husband and our children.
    <br>In 2012, we were watching Emmanuel TV on the internet.
    <br>That was how we found out about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Our position at that time was very bad.
    <br>We were disappointed; we didn't have money, food or work.
    <br>Our children were crying.
    <br>I told my husband that since he had a brother in Nigeria who was doing well,
    <br>he should help us to move to Nigeria.
    <br>My husband called his brother and he sold some property and bought us tickets.
    <br>On 22nd December, 2012, we were in the church here.
    <br>The man of God located us and prophesied to me that I had depression
    <br>which could lead to suicide.
    <br>That prophecy was correct about how I was thinking at that time.
    <br>Our position, as I said, was not good at all.
    <br>After the prophecy, the man of God prayed for us and delivered us.
    <br>He said that our way was open now and gave us Morning Water.
    <br>Before we left the church, an evangelist gave us 3,000 naira for our transport
    <br>costs to our hotel but our hotel was not far; it was close by.
    <br>So, we walked and kept that 3,000 naira.
    <br>"TB Joshua Gave Us N3,000 ($8); Now We Are MILLIONAIRES!!!"
    <br>In the New Year's Eve Candlelight Service, the man of God prophesied to the whole world that
    <br>it would be a good year to do foodstuff business.
    <br>That night, after the service, we went back to our hotel room.
    <br>We prayed that God would let this year be a good and successful one for us
    <br>and we ministered the Morning Water.
    <br>That day, we decided to start with what we had - the 3,000 naira.
    <br>My husband went to the market and bought six packets of pounded yam.
    <br>It's just a small thing; it's not too big, just six packets of pounded yam.
    <br>After the market, we went to the airport and back to our country, Russia.
    <br>When we got to Moscow, my husband went to the market
    <br>and sold the six packets of pounded yam within one minute.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, this 3,000 naira which is equal to $20, turned into $200.
    <br>As he came back to the house and showed me the $200,
    <br>I began to imagine how it was possible that it went from 20 to 200!
    <br>We sat down and thought that the business was very good.
    <br>"TB Joshua Gave Us N3,000 ($8); Now We Are MILLIONAIRES!!!"
    <br>We sent the $200 to his brother who'd help us buy more and post it to us.
    <br>That was how the $200 multiplied to $500 and $500 to $1,000.
    <br>As I said, we started on 1st January, 2013.
    <br>Now, in 2016, we have four shops.
    <br>"TB Joshua Gave Us N3,000 ($8); Now We Are MILLIONAIRES!!!"
    <br>We also have a hair salon, where we do hairstyling and other services.
    <br>In June this year, we bought a new 2015 model Toyota Highlander -
    <br>it is not a fairly used one; it is brand new.
    <br>"TB Joshua Gave Us N3,000 ($8); Now We Are MILLIONAIRES!!!"
    <br>Wow! Glory be to Jesus Christ!
    <br>Madam, we really rejoice with you for what God Almighty has done in your life.
    <br>Right now, we can also see some pictures next to you.
    <br>We would like you to explain to viewers, people that are listening to you -
    <br>what are we seeing on the board next to you?
    <br>These are the pictures of our shops.
    <br>As you can see, the name of our shop is "Afroshop",
    <br>and it is the one and only African shop in the whole of Russia.
    <br>"TB Joshua Gave Us N3,000 ($8); Now We Are MILLIONAIRES!!!"
    <br>These are pictures from different angles and this is what our salon looks like.
    <br>This is the latest model and we have two now.
    <br>"TB Joshua Gave Us N3,000 ($8); Now We Are MILLIONAIRES!!!"
    <br>My advice is: don't look at the Morning Water as if it is small.
    <br>It has very big power - nothing is more powerful than it.
    <br>You should believe in it and it will work.
    <br>Look at me as a confirmation.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>"TB Joshua Gave Us N3,000 ($8); Now We Are MILLIONAIRES!!!"
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>We thank God for the life of our Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My name is Ezenwa Felix Nwankwo.
    <br>I'm from Enugu State but I have Russian nationality.
    <br>Through this church, when things were getting difficult for us in Russia,
    <br>one of my legs was already outside.
    <br>I thought that I could not stay there as I did not have documents or anything.
    <br>After the man of God gave my wife the prophecy, we returned to Russia.
    <br>In 2013, they called me and gave me a Russian passport immediately.
    <br>"TB Joshua Gave Us N3,000 ($8); Now We Are MILLIONAIRES!!!"
    <br>It was through the medium of the Morning Water.
    <br>This is a very powerful medium through which we got our breakthrough.
    <br>If anyone did not believe this Morning Water, let them believe
    <br>as I have believed and seen it is true - it opens doors for the poor.
    <br>It helps many people; this is a very mighty anointing.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You mentioned that before you came to The SCOAN,
    <br>the problem that you were having was depression and suicidal thoughts.
    <br>Can you tell us, now, after your deliverance and message of prophecy,
    <br>how is the situation of depression in your life now?
    <br>What depression are you talking about?
    <br>I drive the latest Jeep, wear fine clothes,
    <br>wear gold, my children eat four times a day and you ask me about depression!
    <br>"TB Joshua Gave Us N3,000 ($8); Now We Are MILLIONAIRES!!!"
    <br>I'm very fine now.
    <br>From 3,000 naira, we turned to millionaires so no depression.
