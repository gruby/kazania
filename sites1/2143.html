    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank you. I want to salute our leaders from the Dominican Republic.
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>And all other nations, including Christian leaders
    <br>and political leaders,
    <br>and all other professionals here present - thank you very much for coming.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>I am in the presence of our leaders and pastors
    <br>and I know the Lord will lead us to what to say.
    <br>Let's quickly take our reading from the Book of 1 Corinthians.
    <br>I will go straight to the proof text here.
    <br>1 Corinthians 2:4.
    <br>"My message
    <br>and my preaching
    <br>were not with wise and persuasive words,
    <br>but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power".
    <br>Verse 10: "These are the things God has revealed to us by His Spirit.
    <br>The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
    <br>For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit...?"
    <br>God is Spirit.
    <br>When we say, 'God is Spirit',
    <br>we are also spirit beings.
    <br>The real thing about us
    <br>is not our bodies.
    <br>This will lead us to the message title:
    <br>BE SPIRIT-FILLED
    <br>I meet a lot of people
    <br>expressing their desire
    <br>to be fulfilled, to achieve - and what a wonderful desire!
    <br>Everyone wants to be filled;
    <br>however, there is a condition
    <br>to fulfil the desire.
    <br>We need to be grounded
    <br>in the Word.
    <br>I mean, we need to be rooted
    <br>in the Word of God
    <br>or else,
    <br>nothing would be there for the Spirit to remind us of.
    <br>We must be rooted in the Word before we are Spirit-filled.
    <br>How can one be rooted, grounded in the Word?
    <br>To be rooted, grounded in the Word
    <br>- in the Word of God -
    <br>we need to search the Word
    <br>and stand in reverence of it.
    <br>Not only to search the Word
    <br>but to stand in reverence, in obedience of it.
    <br>As we stand in reverence,
    <br>the Spirit will be released.
    <br>As we obey the Word,
    <br>the Spirit will be released.
    <br>That is the Spirit of God.
    <br>To the degree,
    <br>to the measure
    <br>we stand in reverence of His Word,
    <br>the Spirit will be released.
    <br>How?
    <br>There is what we call meditation.
    <br>We become part of the Word by meditation.
    <br>The Word takes the place of the unseen Christ.
    <br>Meditate on it -
    <br>it is a visit with Him.
    <br>If you want to visit Him,
    <br>meditate in it -
    <br>in the Word.
    <br>It is a visit with Him.
    <br>The more we meditate
    <br>on what we read
    <br>the more the Spirit acts on It.
    <br>The more we meditate and turn it over and over again in our heart, the more the Spirit will be released.
    <br>I mean, the more the Word dominates our heart,
    <br>the more it influences our conduct and character.
    <br>Take note: The more the Word of God dominates your heart,
    <br>the more it influences your conduct
    <br>and your character.
    <br>Mark 16:18 -
    <br>it is a common saying among Christians.
    <br>"When you lay your hand on the sick,
    <br>they shall recover".
    <br>Nothing will happen unless we act on the Word,
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>because God's Word has priority over His name.
    <br>It is the Word
    <br>that has taught us
    <br>the value
    <br>of the name.
    <br>The Word.
    <br>It is the Word
    <br>that has taught us
    <br>the value of the name,
    <br>the authority of the name -
    <br>our legal right of using the name Jesus.
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>God's Word has priority over His name.
    <br>We are saved by the Word.
    <br>We are saved by the Gospel,
    <br>which teaches us that Christ died on the Cross for our sin
    <br>and rose from the dead.
    <br>Hearing
    <br>that Word of grace
    <br>and embracing it by faith
    <br>is what saves us.
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>It is possible
    <br>to know the Word
    <br>and be sound in doctrine
    <br>and never be converted.
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Because
    <br>we are only made spiritual
    <br>by living in the Word
    <br>and by the Word living in us.
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>It is not the theory of the Word,
    <br>it is not the history of the Word
    <br>that builds one up spiritually;
    <br>we are only made spiritual
    <br>by living in the Word
    <br>and by the Word living in us.
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>It is not only committing the Word to memory,
    <br>which is valuable,
    <br>but it is letting the Word
    <br>become an integral part of our being.
    <br>Not just committing the Word to memory - memorising the Word,
    <br>which is valuable,
    <br>but it is letting the Word become an integral part of our being,
    <br>because we are saved by the Word.
    <br>We are saved by the Word.
    <br>I want us to rise up.
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit of truth
    <br>to reveal Jesus to you.
    <br>Holy Spirit of truth,
    <br>as John 14:26 -
    <br>Holy Spirit of truth,
    <br>reveal to me Jesus Christ!
    <br>Open your heart.
    <br>Holy Spirit of truth,
    <br>reveal to me Jesus Christ!
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Ask Him to help you
    <br>to serve Him
    <br>with all your talents,
    <br>your time,
    <br>your money,
    <br>labour of love.
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Help me, Lord
    <br>to serve You
    <br>with all my talents,
    <br>my time,
    <br>my money
    <br>and labour of love.

    <br>of all my wrongs -
    <br>in action,
    <br>in thought,
    <br>in deeds,
    <br>knowingly

    <br>of all my wrongs!

    <br>Be the Spirit of adoption to me!
    <br>Thank You, Lord,
    <br>for freeing me
    <br>from the law of sin
    <br>and death!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The Dominican Republic
    <br>Pastors' Conference With T.B. Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>I pray for the character of the Holy Spirit
    <br>to come into your life,
    <br>in Jesus' name!
    <br>Let Him be the Spirit of adoption to you!
    <br>Thank You, Lord,
