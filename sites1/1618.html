  <p>    
    <br>There was one woman you met.
    <br>It was never your making but you just fell in love with the woman; this is affecting you.
    <br>This happened last year in August.
    <br>Since that time, you always dream of seeing a woman.
    <br>Anytime you have a breakthrough, something is coming your way.
    <br>It's true, sir.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Chukwu Emeka Nwodo.
    <br>The woman standing by my side is my lovely wife
    <br>and these are my children.
    <br>The prophecy that I received from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua was true.
    <br>It happened on April 27th 2014 when I was in the service.
    <br>The man of God walked up to me as he was giving prophecy.
    <br>Before eight rows of chairs from where I was sitting, my hands started shaking.
    <br>So the man of God said that there was a lady that I encountered,
    <br>and that was the cause of my disappointment, that I was having so much disappointment.
    <br>So I told him that it was true and it was true.
    <br>There was a lady I encountered some time ago, but I never knew I was playing the role of infidelity to my wife.
    <br>I wasn't truthful. I never knew that this was what was holding me back,
    <br>causing all the disappointment that I was having in life.
    <br>But after that prophecy, we were arranged at the prayer line.
    <br>The man of God prayed for me and told me that all my disappointments were over.
    <br>After the prophecy, after the prayer of the man of God, even that day, the man of God touched my first son
    <br>who was having a problem in the stomach and that problem ceased.
    <br>Then after the prophecy, I found out that my business started flourishing.
    <br>Even people around me coming to my shop were saying, "Ah, this man is doing well now".
    <br>With the flourishing of my business,  I was able to seal the union of my marriage to my wife
    <br>which I had not been able to do before when I was living an extramarital life.
    <br>But I stopped all that life.
    <br>Anything the man of God says, just do it.
    <br>After the prophecy of the man of God, I learnt a lot from it. I never knew my mistake.
    <br>So I realised my mistake and I follow the Word of the Lord.
    <br>After that, my business started booming.
    <br>I was able to feed and cater for my children financially.
    <br>I was able to seal the union with my wife at marriage level.
    <br>I was able to buy a car - this is the car key here -
    <br>which I am using to convey my family to wherever we are going.
    <br>This is the picture of the car.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>We have just seen the proof of the power of prophecy.
    <br>I just want to ask our brother: How did you feel on that day when you were on your way to the church?
    <br>Can you just explain to us, the kind of burden on you on that day you were coming to the service.
    <br>That day when I came to church, I was having a lot of disappointment.
    <br>In the sense that nothing was working in my life.
    <br>I should call it near-success syndrome.
    <br>Whatever thing I laid my hands on, never prospered.
    <br>Whatever I set my hands upon, never prospered.
    <br>I was surprised that the man of God walked up to me and went to the root of my problem.
    <br>Indeed, the man of God prayed for me and delivered me from the problem. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah! Where can we go from His presence?
    <br>North, East, South and West - He is omnipresent.
    <br>After the prophecy of the man of God, I am very happy and elated to stand in your midst
    <br>to tell people that my life has changed for the better because before, I was having a lot of setback.
    <br>But after the deliverance and prayers of the man of God, my life changed.
    <br>My business started flourishing; I don't even know how it happened but it happened.
    <br>Whenever I was in my shop, customers would be coming; my sales starting growing.
    <br>So I was very happy.
    <br>How is life now between you, your wife and your children, the family as a whole?
    <br>The life between my wife and I is the best ever; it had never happened before.
    <br>After the prophecy, I love my wife with all my heart.
    <br>I love her, I take care of every financial responsibility in the house.
    <br>Hallelujah! Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Yes, the evidence of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Immediately Jesus entered into this marriage, He put an end to their past
    <br>and gave birth to their joyful and successful future indeed.
    <br>We can see the glory of God radiating all over this family to prove to you the power of prophecy.
    <br>Hallelujah, we give glory to God.
    <br>Before we are going to listen to your wonderful advice, for the people listening to you all over the world,
    <br>we would like to hear a word or two from your wife,
    <br>what she has to say concerning what God has done in her life and her family.
    <br>Madam, you are very much welcome. Can you please introduce yourself.
    <br>Tell us your name and your own part of this testimony.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Nwodo.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband, Mr Joseph Emeka Nwodo.
    <br>These are my lovely children.
    <br>Our testimony goes like this:
    <br>On that fateful day, I was at the nursing mothers'
    <br>when the man of God spoke to my husband and was telling him the root of his problem.
    <br>My husband was looking at the man of God as if he didn't know what he was saying.
    <br>I was sitting there saying, "Yes, I know that it is true".
    <br>When we got home, my husband was telling me
    <br>that he didn't know what the man of God was saying.
    <br>I then went to the root of the problem and said to him,
    <br>"Do you remember so and so day I met that girl and now you are lying to me?"
    <br>He now remembered and said, "Oh yes, that is true".
    <br>At the end, I give God the glory.
    <br>I give God thanks because it takes wisdom for a woman to gather the family despite what happened.
    <br>I give God the glory.
    <br>The man of God then delivered us, he delivered my husband.
    <br>I was telling him, "Man of God, look at my..."; he said, "Don't worry, my daughter. All is over".
    <br>He then prayed for us.
    <br>He signed this book for us and said it was over.
    <br>When I got home, I pressed my hand on the signature and kept praying to God,
    <br>"God, please help us, help my marriage, help my husband".
    <br>And from then, God really remembered us.
    <br>He changed everything for good. My husband became a changed person.
    <br>I myself started loving him as a husband; whatever he says I do.
    <br>He loves the children, he loves me too.
    <br>Before I open my mouth, he will do it.
    <br>He would come back and tell me many stories that happened.
    <br>I give God the glory.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>You can see how the testimony is flowing from our sister.
    <br>In fact, words, millions and millions of words are not enough to testify or glorify the name of God
    <br>for what He has done in her life.
    <br>My advice to the people listening to me right now and the whole world, is that:
    <br>before, I did not know what I was doing.
    <br>I was on the path of infidelity. I never knew, I just found myself doing it.
    <br>But after the prophecy, I realised that Jesus Christ is the only Way, not just a way.
    <br>According to the Word of God in John 14:6, Jesus Christ is the only Way, the Truth and the Life.
    <br>So my advice is that: Everyone should desist from whatever thing that does not please God
    <br>and follow the ways of the Lord. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank you for those wonderful words of advice.
    <br>As our brother has said that Jesus is the only Way
    <br>and no state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with Him.
    <br>Madam, we would like to hear your own advice as well.
    <br>My word of advice to the whole world, especially to women:
    <br>In my own case, I saw the girl face to face. I even confronted her.
    <br>I pretended as if my husband was my brother.
    <br>She poured out everything. I heard it but at the end, I didn't destroy the marriage.
    <br>I didn't raise alarm, I didn't call people, I sorted it out with my husband.
    <br>My advice to the whole world is this: If you are a woman and you find your husband in such act,
    <br>don't tell people, don't raise alarm, say it to God.
    <br>Then when God comes in, He will finalise everything. Emmanuel!
    <br>Hallelujah! Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Because as she has said, the right knowledge of God settles all peace.
    <br>We have heard from the sister who said that no matter the problem you are going through,
    <br>don't run from God, but run to Him because He is the solution to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>And today, we can see the proof in the life of this family.
    <br>So we thank God, we give glory to God for what He has done in your life and your family,
    <br>restoring back this union to the glory of God.
    <br>We want to advise you that now that God Almighty has restored that peace and happiness
    <br>into your home, make sure you continue to follow Him along the way,
    <br>make His Word the foundation of your home and for your life
    <br>and you will see that better is not good enough, the best is still yet to come.
