  <p>    
    <br>My name is David Ogen; I am from the UK but born in Slovakia.
    <br>This is my wife Nicole and my daughter Jasmine.
    <br>I begin our testimony because I was healed by the grace of God from cancer.
    <br>In December last year, I was passing blood.
    <br>I went to the doctor in February and the doctor said that I needed to go to hospital to check my bleeding.
    <br>When I went to hospital, they used a camera to check it and said I had a tumour
    <br>about 7cm long and I needed chemoradiotherapy and after that an operation.
    <br>The diagnosis showed you had a tumour - which part of your body?
    <br>It was in the colon, about 6cm from the entrance.
    <br>After the chemoradiotherapy, they said I would have to do an operation.
    <br>Can you tell us some of the things that you were experiencing before you went for that diagnosis?
    <br>What were some of the symptoms you were having?
    <br>I had to go to the toilet about 7 or 8 times a day and I had back pain.
    <br>I had to stop working because of my toilet issues.
    <br>That affected my family because I couldn't work any more.
    <br>At that point in time, tell us how that affected you in terms of your stooling, going to the toilet.
    <br>I went to the toilet about 8 times a day.
    <br>It smelled because of the blood and because the cancer was rotten and very smelly.
    <br>I couldn't work any more because I had to go to the toilet all the time, sometimes for 20 minutes.
    <br>In this way, you can't go anywhere away from the house.
    <br>Can you tell us what kind of surgery they wanted to do for you and the implications?
    <br>The doctors said that after my chemoradiotherapy that tried to shrink the tumour,
    <br>I would have to go for an operation which is about 8 to 10 hours long.
    <br>They would take my manhood out and go to my stomach at the back
    <br>and probably I would have to wear a colostomy bag for the rest of my life
    <br>if the operation was not successful.
    <br>There would be a 50-60% probability I would have to wear the colostomy bag, or 5% that I would die,
    <br>or 20% that I would lose my manhood.
    <br>This means there were many issues.
    <br>After the doctors told you all this, can you tell us what then happened and what was going through your mind
    <br>as they were telling you all this about possibly losing your manhood or even not surviving
    <br>and also that the surgery would last 8 to 10 hours, requiring your manhood and rectum to be taken out?
    <br>What did you feel at that time?
    <br>Of course my wife was not very happy either, but I knew I had faith in God
    <br>and I knew that if we came to The SCOAN all these issues would be solved.
    <br>This is why we decided and on 22 July last year we came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, touched me and I was healed.
    <br>Hallelujah, put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Tell us, after that touch, what happened when you went back to your country?
    <br>After I went back to my country, I should have gone for an operation on 4 August
    <br>but I told my surgeon I would not go for the operation, that I was healed by the grace of God.
    <br>They thought I was mad because no one normally turns down an operation for a tumour
    <br>so they said I needed to see the boss of the hospital who was also a surgeon.
    <br>He said he would check himself and if the tumour was not there, they would not do the operation.
    <br>He went to check it and by the grace of God there was nothing there.
    <br>When the doctors discovered that the tumour was gone without any surgery, what was their expression?
    <br>They were surprised.
    <br>Even my brother came with me because he thought I was mad.
    <br>I had one choice - to die or live - and they thought without the surgery I would die.
    <br>But I had a faith in God and by His grace I was well.
    <br>Now today you live to the glory of God. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We can see some documents and also pictures on the board; can you please explain them?
    <br>This document says about my colon cancer, showing when it was discovered in February.
    <br>This is the picture taken by the camera on 8 February of the tumour.
    <br>This was about 6cm by 7cm.
    <br>This was after I came back from The SCOAN.
    <br>You can see from the picture that there is nothing there any more.
    <br>This is like it should be, and this is when the tumour was there.
    <br>Can you tell us the other problem that you had that brought you here
    <br>and that God Almighty has also set you free from?
    <br>I was a chain smoker before; for 25 years I could not stop smoking.
    <br>Even if I was healed from cancer, I would still carry on smoking; I just couldn't stop.
    <br>I prayed to God to take from me this addiction.
    <br>I knew that before I came to The SCOAN again, my addiction would stop.
    <br>God delivered me from the smoking.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My name is Nicole Ogen, the man beside me is my husband and this is our daughter Jasmine Ogen.
    <br>In December 2017, immediately after Christmas, my husband started passing blood.
    <br>There was something about this blood - when he passed it, it smelled like a dead body.
    <br>He went to the general doctor in January and that was when he was sent to the specialist.
    <br>Before we knew it, they sent us some guidelines about cancer.
    <br>We were surprised because you hear that cancer kills people in the UK.
    <br>There was a programme on the BBC that said that every 45 minutes, someone dies of cancer.
    <br>It was really tough for us.
    <br>It is something you don't want to happen to anyone you love, not even your enemy.
    <br>But it happened to us, and we got the treatment plan.
    <br>When he was diagnosed with cancer, he had to stop working because he was in pain,
    <br>a severe back pain so he couldn't sit.
    <br>They had to give him a very strong painkiller.
    <br>He was put on chemotherapy for five weeks, every day of the week, Monday to Friday.
    <br>I asked him, "Do they want to kill you? People have chemotherapy for 2 or 3 days a week.
    <br>Why are you having it for five days?"
    <br>But we used to pray with the man of God before he started chemotherapy,
    <br>believing that all the side effects of chemotherapy would not happen to him.
    <br>We prayed and believed but I was so afraid, so I had to take time off work
    <br>in case he fell sick from chemotherapy.
    <br>That was how bad it was.
    <br>Both of us are working people; we were never on benefits.
    <br>He earned more, and it affected our finances a lot.
    <br>It was really tough and one day he came back and explained the surgery he was going to have.
    <br>I asked what the implications would be.
    <br>He said he would have a colostomy bag and they would take off his manhood, put it on the table
    <br>and after the surgery they would put it back.
    <br>He said the surgery would take 8 to 10 hours.
    <br>I said, "This is huge. We have a choice. Either we believe God and go to the man of God
    <br>and he will pray for you, or you go through the surgery. Anything you choose, I will support you."
    <br>He chose to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>After the prayer, he came back and went to the surgeon.
    <br>He told the surgeon that he was healed and didn't want to have the surgery.
    <br>The surgeon asked him, "Are you mad? You have to have the surgery."
    <br>We said no.
    <br>Sometimes I was afraid, also thinking he should have the surgery -
    <br>since he had gone for prayer, even if he had the surgery nothing would happen to him.
    <br>But he remained adamant; "No, I'm healed."
    <br>I said, "Okay, let your faith make you whole."
    <br>So the surgeon said he was going to perform a scan and take a biopsy
    <br>to see if the cells around there are cancerous.
    <br>But when they did it, there was no cancer.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>That was the end of the story.
    <br>But the surgeon still didn't believe, so he said he would perform the scan three consecutive times,
    <br>every three months to check, and that was what happened.
    <br>After the three different scans, what was the outcome?
    <br>Everything showed as normal.
    <br>No more cancer.
    <br>Everything showed?
    <br>Normal - everything was normal.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?
    <br>And madam, we also understand from your testimony, even before your husband had this problem
    <br>and came for his healing here, you also have a testimony regarding your baby.
    <br>Can you share that with us as well?
    <br>Yes, I do have a testimony regarding my baby.
    <br>I was believing God for the fruit of the womb.
    <br>I was praying along with the man of God.
    <br>And now I have Jasmine, as you see.
    <br>She is a miracle in my hands, through praying with the prophet.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?
    <br>Multiple testimonies.
    <br>Your husband said for 25 years he was addicted to smoking.
    <br>What can you tell us, what was your experience about that?
    <br>My husband was someone that smoked so much that even in the middle of the night,
    <br>he would wake up and go and smoke, and come back and sleep.
    <br>That is how bad it was.
    <br>But after the prayer, he doesn't smoke any more and we give glory to God.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Since after your husband was prayed for, tell us how all his system is functioning now.
    <br>He is back to work, which is amazing because our finances can come back to normal.
    <br>He is okay; as you can see, he is very fit.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ?
    <br>I have two pieces of advice.
    <br>Look for a Bible-believing church.
    <br>The man of God says, "Don't read the Bible as history. 
    <br>Let the Word of God be active in your life.
    <br>Let that Word be living in your heart."
    <br>Amen.
    <br>That is what produces fruit.
    <br>My second advice is that in Ecclesiastes 3:11 the Bible says that God makes all things beautiful
    <br>at His own time, not our time.
    <br>My husband's smoking caused me a lot of grief and it cost us a lot of finances.
    <br>In the UK, a pack of cigarettes costs about £10, and he could smoke five packs a week,
    <br>which dipped a lot into our pockets.
    <br>But today, it is a thing of history and I am thanking God for restoring my family, in Jesus' name.
