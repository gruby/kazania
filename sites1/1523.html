  <p>    
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, from the bottom of my heart!
    <br>Lift your hands and give thanks to Him.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>You are welcome in His name.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, you are welcome in His presence".
    <br>Jesus Christ is the reason we are here today - our Healer, our Deliverer and our Lord.
    <br>His name be glorified, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How are you today?"
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Jesus is the reason for our gathering today.
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>The Bible says that there is power in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>There is power in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>But if you do not use that name, Jesus Christ, in love and in faith, that name can do nothing.
    <br>If you use that name, Jesus Christ, in faith and in love,
    <br>that name will be as if it was on the lips of Apostle Peter in the Book of Acts 3:4-6.
    <br>Peter said to the crippled man, "Silver and gold I do not have, but what I have I give you.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, rise and walk",
    <br>and the Bible says the lame began to walk.
    <br>That is the meaning of the name, Jesus Christ, on the lips of Apostle Peter.
    <br>But when you call that name, Jesus, without faith, nothing will happen.
    <br>When you call that name, you must call that name in Spirit and in faith.
    <br>If not, there will be no more evidence on the outside.
    <br>There are many good churches today who have a pastor who is a good teacher of the Bible
    <br>and the people understand the Scriptures.
    <br>But the real power of God is not operating in their midst.
    <br>When you ask the seven sons of Sceva in the Book of Acts 19,
    <br>they will say that if you call that name, Jesus, if that name is not planted in your heart,
    <br>that name will be meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Praying is not saying words but praying the prayer".
    <br>Praying is not saying words but praying the prayer.
    <br>This brings us to our message this morning: The Prayer Of Faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Prayer Of Faith".
    <br>Praying is not saying words but praying the prayer.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of 2 Corinthians 4.
    <br>I will start my reading from verse 13.
    <br>"And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written,
    <br>'I believed and therefore I spoke,' we also believe and therefore speak."
    <br>Say, "I believe and therefore I speak".
    <br>That spirit of faith is expressed by believing with the heart and speaking with the mouth.
    <br>The disciples of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ had been delivering people from evil spirits,
    <br>casting out demons but the Bible says in the Book of Mark 9,
    <br>that certain day, they met a stiff opposition.
    <br>There was a day, they had an encounter with a demon-possessed boy
    <br>and they were unable to deliver the boy.
    <br>And the father of the demon-possessed boy looked at them with a bad impression;
    <br>a lot of things were going through his mind.
    <br>Then he began to look for Jesus.
    <br>When Jesus came, the Bible says, Jesus rebuked the evil spirit
    <br>and the boy was delivered at once.
    <br>The disciples had the power to deliver but lacked the necessary faith to release that power.
    <br>Let someone say, "Prayer is not saying words".
    <br>Without faith, prayer is ineffective.
    <br>The man of God says that faith comes from the Word of God.
    <br>The Word of God is Spirit and life and has the ability to produce a spiritual force
    <br>which grows and develops within our hearts called faith.
    <br>It is acting on the Word of God that builds faith in our hearts,
    <br>not just studying the Word.
    <br>We study the Word and act on the Word
    <br>until it gets into our blood and gains supremacy over us.
    <br>For the Word to get into our blood, it means the Word becomes an integral part of us.
    <br>For the Word to gain supremacy, it means that faith comes
    <br>when the Word prevails over our thinking processes, not our way, not our mind.
    <br>Let someone say again, "Prayer is not saying words".
    <br>When we say, "Prayer is not saying words,"
    <br>God does not need my words to move Him into action
    <br>because God has His own way of implementing His will in the universe.
    <br>Therefore, it becomes necessary for us to consult God so that we may know His will,
    <br>so that our actions may line up with the will of God.
    <br>How do we know the will of God?
    <br>To know the will of God, we must know the Word of God.
    <br>Man has the ability to pray, to teach, but the Holy Spirit prays as He wills,
    <br>teaches as He wills, preaches as He wills.
    <br>This means, the Word and the Spirit must come together.
    <br>Let someone say, "The Word and the Spirit must come together".
    <br>Not only must we have God's Word in order to know His will, we also need God's Spirit.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that there is an inseparable union between the Word and the Spirit
    <br>which indicates that the Spirit always leads in prayer.
    <br>This means, it is God's power working through His Word and by His Spirit that brings about the result,
    <br>that makes that prayer effective.
    <br>Prayer is not saying words but praying the prayer.
    <br>What do we mean by 'praying the prayer'?
    <br>One of the principles that governs prayer is that of co-operating with God
    <br>in prayer through the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Holy Spirit prays within us.
    <br>He supplies the inspiration of what to pray for.
    <br>When the word to pray comes from within,
    <br>when you speak what comes from your heart, you will have the result.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, prayer is not saying words but praying the prayer".
    <br>The Holy Spirit prays within us.
    <br>Therefore, brethren, no matter the situation you are facing today,
    <br>no matter the trouble that brought you here today,
    <br>don't allow that situation to dictate the direction of your prayers.
    <br>Are you facing barrenness?
    <br>Are you facing difficulty in your job?
    <br>Whatever that trouble is, don't allow that situation to dictate the direction of your prayers
    <br>because God is still saying something.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, God is still saying something".
    <br>Faith focuses on God.
    <br>No matter the trouble you have today,
    <br>the Bible says, 'Don't measure your Christian life by the challenges'.
    <br>That is why after we have prayed,
    <br>that prayer must be followed by an attitude of absolute trust in God
    <br>that He is working out the answer - stop doubting.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, whatever you are facing now,
    <br>whatever is your challenge -
    <br>right now begin to reset your mind, begin to reset your heart
    <br>by focusing on God.
    <br>Faith focuses on God Almighty, not on the problem.
    <br>When you focus on God, you will be calm, determined and calculated
    <br>even when everything around you is unquiet.
    <br>God never promised to keep us away from tests, trials and temptation
    <br>but He promised to see us through.
    <br>Therefore, no matter what you are facing right now in your life, in your career,
    <br>don't allow this to dictate your direction and see God in a bad light.
    <br>God is still saying something. Focus on God.
    <br>If we commit our works, if we commit our ways to God,
    <br>God has promised to carry us in the arms of His strength, just as a nurse carries a child.
    <br>God has promised to strengthen our spirit with His Spirit.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, this is the time to exchange your strength with God's strength".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the Word of God is a living and growing force".
    <br>Say, "Today is my day".
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Say, "I am in the arena of liberty".
    <br>The prayers you have been offering are not lost.
    <br>Whatever you have been facing before was just to strengthen your belief in Christ.
    <br>That prayer is not lost.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Therefore, we should remember that scriptural prayer releases the power of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Scriptural prayer releases the power of God".
    <br>Scriptural prayer is prayer filled with the Scriptures.
    <br>It brings an answer from God because it is pregnant of faith
    <br>and faith activates prayer.
    <br>Faith energises and activates our prayer.
    <br>Faith is the force that moves our words to work.
    <br>So if the motivation to pray comes from within -
    <br>it is the indwelling Word coming from our heart, out of our lips
    <br>that produces an overcoming spirit within us.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, it is the Word of God, the Word of heart, coming out of our mouth
    <br>that produces an overcoming spirit within us.
    <br>The extent to which you think the thoughts of Christ,
    <br>to that same extent we have the power of God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the extent to which you think the thoughts of Christ,
    <br>to that extent you have the power of God.
    <br>The Bible says, "Out of the abundance of our heart, the mouth speaks".
    <br>Say, "Out of the abundance of my heart, my mouth speaks".
    <br>Say, "Prayer is not saying words but praying the prayer".
    <br>Finally brethren, we need to know:
    <br>The prayer of faith - God's Word must be the foundation.
    <br>God will not move us to pray for something that is not sanctioned by the Scriptures.
    <br>Say, "God will not move me to pray for anything that is not sanctioned by the Scriptures".
    <br>This means, to pray in the Spirit is to pray in harmony with the Word of God
    <br>and when you pray in harmony with the Word of God, you are praying with the will of God.
    <br>Therefore, fill your prayers with the Scriptures.
    <br>Using the Word of God you read daily helps ensure that your prayers line up with the will of God
    <br>and His intention for your life.
    <br>When you do that, your objectives and motives will be determined at once.
    <br>This means, you will know what God wants for you and you will know the reason God wants it.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, this is the key - faith".
    <br>Say, "My heart is the prayer room".
    <br>Say, "My heart must be rooted, grounded in the Word of God".
    <br>When it does, faith stands
    <br>because with my heart I believe, with my mouth I confess, and faith is both.
    <br>If our hearts and our minds are filled with the Word of God by meditating on it day and night,
    <br>you will speak the Word of faith day and night.
    <br>If they attack in the dream, you speak the Word of faith.
    <br>In the day - the Word of faith; in your business - the Word of faith;
    <br>in your career - the Word of faith.
    <br>Today, the Word of faith will change your situation.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>You have heard the testimonies today?
    <br>Say, "My testimony has come!"
    <br>Say, "Today!"
    <br>Can you speak to your giant?
    <br>Can you speak to your problem?
    <br>Stand up and speak to your problem!
    <br>Say, "My problem, you giant, I will not allow you to dictate the direction of my prayers.
    <br>You mountain, I command you, in the name of Jesus - give way!
    <br>Today is my day!"
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>God bless His Word.
