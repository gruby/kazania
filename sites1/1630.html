    <br>T.B. JOSHUA'S PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO SOUTH SUDAN
    <br>NOV 12TH 2019
    <br>PROPHECY FOR SOUTH SUDAN ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¸!!! |
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Here we are; the state house in Juba in the Republic of South Sudan,
    <br>where moments ago Prophet T.B. Joshua landed at Juba international airport
    <br>and was welcomed by President General Salva Kiir Mayardit and the entire member of the cabinet.
    <br>And now, members of the government have come here to the state house,
    <br>have assembled to listen to the words of wisdom from God's servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>As the man of God says, the right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>In the world's youngest nation - South Sudan,
    <br>who came to independence just in 2011;
    <br>this country has been experiencing terrible, violent civil war for many years,
    <br>and now at the brink of an everlasting peace.
    <br>Where human wisdom has failed, God has the final answer.
    <br>And that is where men of God, servants of God step in.
    <br>The leaders of this nation and the public see Prophet's T.B. Joshua historic visit
    <br>as God's answer to their many years of prayer and supplication for peace and reconciliation.
    <br>Right now, let's get ready to listen to what Prophet T.B. Joshua has to say,
    <br>right here, from the state house in Juba.
    <br>PRESIDENT S.K MAYARDIT AND T.B. JOSHUA ARRIVE AT THE STATE HOUSE, JUBA
    <br>People of God, let us get ready to receive our President and Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>PRESIDENT S.K MAYARDIT AND T.B. JOSHUA ARRIVE AT THE STATE HOUSE, JUBA
    <br>They have arrived.
    <br>Can we please receive them with clap.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA WITH VICE PRESIDENT GENERAL PROF. JAMES WANU IGGA
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA AT THE STATE HOUSE
    <br>PRESIDENT S.K MAYARDIT & T.B. JOSHUA AT THE STATE HOUSE
    <br>Your Excellency, President Salva Kiir Mayardit, Excellencies, brothers and sisters,
    <br>the people of the Republic of South Sudan,
    <br>we are today really honoured to receive among us the man of God who is known all over the world.
    <br>And that is nobody other than Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>His Excellency, the President of South Sudan,
    <br>opinion leaders,
    <br>all protocol duly respected.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR MAYARDIT
    <br>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for welcoming me.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>He who honours a prophet because he is a prophet
    <br>receives the reward of a prophet.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Thank you for honouring me.
    <br>You can have your seats, thank you.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>I am here to deliver God's message and prayer.
    <br>As a prophet, I need to be specific - that is, I should not say what God has not said.
    <br>I pray that God gives you all the political stakeholders in this country discretion
    <br>that will guide their hearts to obey this Word.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>I pray the Lord gives you all the political stakeholders in this country the discretion
    <br>that will guide their hearts to obey this Word, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Yes - the voice of God.
    <br>Time has come.
    <br>This is seventh time I have been invited to this country.
    <br>Each time I received an invitation, I would ask God and the Lord would say, 'No'.
    <br>For the past eight years - I have those invitations with me.
    <br>But this time, the Lord said, 'Yes'.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Time has come for us to put our differences behind us.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Who can fight with the Lord?
    <br>Time has come for us to put behind us our differences
    <br>and allow this youngest nation in the world.
    <br>The glory is big.
    <br>Now God wants to intervene.
    <br>PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR MAYARDIT
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Time has come.
    <br>If I am a prophet, this will not go without fulfillment.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Take your pen and write.
    <br>I am here to prophesy to the nation; I am not coming here to preach or to teach.
    <br>If I am a prophet, this will not go without fulfillment.
    <br>The issue of this nation is spiritual; we need to tackle it spiritually.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Time has come for us to put our differences behind us.
    <br>Our leaders, we should overcome our divisions and agree to work together
    <br>for the good of this country.
    <br>To show how peace has no price, when I was preparing to come to South Sudan,
    <br>my operator could not find an international insurance company
    <br>to cover our trip to South Sudan because of the situation of the nation.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>The operator recommended that the plane should be parked in Ethiopia or Kenya.
    <br>I said, "Why?"
    <br>They said, "Because of the situation of the nation".
    <br>And this is a country endowed with enormous natural resources.
    <br>How many investors or tourists would want to go through this?
    <br>We cannot do it alone.
    <br>As I travel the world, I have discovered that people from South Sudan
    <br>are everywhere all over the world.
    <br>There is no country on this earth where you will not find South Sudanese.
    <br>They are intelligent, hard-working and ambitious people.
    <br>PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR MAYARDIT
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Our leaders should overcome their divisions and allow them to come back
    <br>to develop their fatherland.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>We should overcome our divisions.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Write it down today what is going to happen.
    <br>You cannot stand in the way of the Lord.
    <br>He owns man's heart and He can instruct man at any time.
    <br>Don't look at my appearance, don't look at the stuff I put on; I had to wear something.
    <br>I had to put on this so that I can look like your brother.
    <br>I want to be very close to you; that is why I put on a suit today.
    <br>Look beyond this appearance.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Beyond this appearance is the man talking.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Next month, we talk of December, New Year.
    <br>This country is going to enter a new year -
    <br>a new beginning!
    <br>Whether you like it or not; whether I like it or not!
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Your agreement does not matter to what God is about to do.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>After this meeting, take your time and look at my antecedents -
    <br>my track record in the ministry, when it comes to prophetic ministry.
    <br>So please, take this word seriously.
    <br>As a prophet, I'm not an orator.
    <br>I'm here to say I need corresponding power to talk.
    <br>I need the suggestion of the Spirit to talk.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Let us pray as the Spirit directs.
    <br>You may choose to sit; you may choose to stand.
    <br>PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR MAYARDIT
    <br>Lord, I pray for the peace of South Sudan.
    <br>Have mercy on the nation.
    <br>Let the leaders and citizens of South Sudan obtain Your mercy.
    <br>Thank You, Lord for Your compassion and forgiveness,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>This is the message and prayer I am sent to deliver.
    <br>It may look few, short but it's pregnant.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>It's pregnant so let us await the results.
    <br>When God says, "Yes" no one can say, "No."
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Time has come for us to overcome our divisions,
    <br>for us to put behind us our differences
    <br>and allow the youngest nation in the world.
    <br>There is no more time for you, for us anymore.
    <br>God wants to move the nation forward.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Long live this peace initiative.
    <br>Long live the youngest nation in the world.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS - T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA WITH PRESIDENT S.K. MAYARDIT & GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
    <br>PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR MAYARDIT
    <br>Good afternoon to all of you.
    <br>You have heard the words of the man of God.
    <br>Please, be seated.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS
    <br>I'm not coming to give a speech but I'm coming to thank the man of God
    <br>and his team for their coming to South Sudan.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS
    <br>PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR MAYARDIT
    <br>In the media and on the TV, worldwide,
    <br>the way South Sudan looks is not the way you see South Sudan
    <br>when you come to South Sudan practically.
    <br>PRESIDENT SALVA KIIR MAYARDIT
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was so brave to resist all that was being told him
    <br>that the streets of Juba were littered with dead bodies,
    <br>that there was no life in Juba so he shouldn't go.
    <br>But he made it a point to come himself to come and witness with his own eyes.
    <br>We thank you very much.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS
    <br>And that is all I wanted to tell you.
    <br>It is up to us to interpret the message that he has given, correctly or wrongly.
    <br>But he has done his job and we will have to judge.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS
    <br>This is the beginning.
    <br>It should be the beginning for the best for the people of South Sudan.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS
    <br>And I would tend to believe also that
    <br>we have crossed a long distance searching for peace.
    <br>Now that the man of God has come to South Sudan, I believe that peace is at the corner.
    <br>STATE HOUSE ADDRESS
    <br>I would like to thank you very much because the programme is still ahead.
    <br>Thank you.
