    <br>The Word I'm about to say is not mine.
    <br>Whatever mountain, whatever situation -
    <br>I decree it, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>This Innocent Looking Man Controlled 999 DEMONS
    <br>Be it an evil spirit that is tormenting your life, out!
    <br>Be it a contrary spirit that is hiding somewhere, tormenting your life,
    <br>I decree, in the name of Jesus, I say, out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua offers mass prayer, many who are demon possessed are arrested.
    <br>You can see a man, laying on the floor behind these two women,
    <br>who had also been arrested because of the evil spirits they possessed.
    <br>My name is Kelechi.
    <br>I possess evil spirits and I have 333 powers.
    <br>I control 999 demons.
    <br>All this started when I went to school.
    <br>I used to go out and preach the gospel, I ministered healing to people,
    <br>I proclaimed the good news of the Lord, I published tracks
    <br>and shared them to people in buses and hospitals.
    <br>People listened and converted.
    <br>Because I saw the many things the man of God did on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>I wanted to be like him and have that power to become like him.
    <br>I was in a place sitting down and meditating.
    <br>Three boys came and told me about a place where I could get that power to do more than him.
    <br>I agreed to that because all I needed was the power to do more than him.
    <br>I followed them with all pleasure; no hesitation.
    <br>When I got there, the tune of the music changed.
    <br>What I saw there was not what I had expected.
    <br>I had to admit that and accept it.
    <br>I was initiated.
    <br>A woman then appeared, an old woman, very haggard and entered into my body.
    <br>That was how I began my duty.
    <br>I was given a duty, a mission for execution of duties.
    <br>I started that work.
    <br>What he is saying is that he is possessed, he has demons inside him,
    <br>where he is looking for power.
    <br>How can one be looking for power when we are born with it?
    <br>The Bible says, "Behold, I have given you".
    <br>So, what we need now is necessary faith to release the power.
    <br>He says he is looking for power.
    <br>When you are looking for power, you see demon's power, not God's power.
    <br>We don't look for God's power, it is there, but the power can remain dormant
    <br>when there is no necessary faith to release it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “There is power in my mouth”.
    <br>The belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.
    <br>So, since your deliverance, how has your life been?
    <br>I feel relieved, I feel fine.
