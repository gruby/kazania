    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God! Hallelujah!
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 2
    <br>She said that her name is Mary and she comes from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic
    <br>I was suffering from a mandibular protrusion, a jaw problem.
    <br>It affected me greatly since I suffered constant headaches and was unable to study or sing.
    <br>I had to use a jaw brace in order to keep my jaw in place,
    <br>but I have stopped using it because I am healed.
    <br>She said the problem that brought her to the crusade with Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>was that she had a deformation of the jaw and this created a lot of pain in her mouth.
    <br>She said that this affected her in her studies,
    <br>affected her in her talking,
    <br>and affected her also in her singing, because she also sings.
    <br>And she said that she had to use a device to try and correct her jaw alignment,
    <br>and this was the problem that brought her.
    <br>This brace was used in order to straighten my jaw, but it caused me a lot of pain.
    <br>I had to wear it all night and part of the day for a total of 16 hours.
    <br>As I mentioned before, it was very painful.
    <br>Now I no longer need to use it; I have been healed!
    <br>She said that this was the device that she was given by the doctor to try and correct the alignment of the jaw.
    <br>She would have to wear it 16 hours at night because of the severe pain that was caused by the jaw problem.
    <br>But now, after the prayer, she doesn't have to use it anymore. She is healed!
    <br>How did you find out about the crusade with Prophet TB Joshua?
    <br>I saw an advert for the crusade and even before that I had prayed for my healing.
    <br>I knew God would use Prophet TB Joshua to heal me, because I had a dream about it.
    <br>She said that she saw about the crusade on a billboard,
    <br>but before that she had actually been watching Prophet TB Joshua on the Internet
    <br>and she had prayed and believed that it was when he came to the country that she would receive her healing.
    <br>She even said that she saw him in a dream beforehand.
    <br>Can you tell us what was your experience when Prophet TB Joshua prayed for you?
    <br>All the pain caused by the jaw deformation left me; it is no longer there!
    <br>She said that after the prophet prayed for her,
    <br>she realised that the pain that she had been experiencing for such a long time had gone.
    <br>That she wasn't feeling the pain anymore.
    <br>I no longer have to use this brace because God has performed His miracle.
    <br>She said that she's feeling fine and well. She doesn't have to use that device because God has healed her.
    <br>Don't lose your faith. Faith is the root of all miracles; without faith, there are no miracles.
    <br>God can do the impossible and He can fix any problem or difficulty that we have.
    <br>She said that she wants to encourage and advise people that you should not lose faith,
    <br>because faith is the root of your miracle.
    <br>That God is a God of impossibilities, and He can make the impossible possible for you.
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Glory be to God! Hallelujah! Thank You for everything!
