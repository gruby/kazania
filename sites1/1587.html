    <br>As the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for this woman,
    <br>the Holy Spirit also inclines him to give her a prophetic message.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>You say you will not forgive.
    <br>We have not committed any unpardonable sin.
    <br>You say you will not forgive - it's too painful. Don't worry.
    <br>Yes. It's true, Man of God.
    <br>Don't worry.
    <br>It was painful for me.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prophecy and Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>So come.
    <br>Why do you say it is very painful? Don't worry.
    <br>You should be ready to forgive now.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You have not forgiven from your heart.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>The problem of your daughter will be solved.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God. Thank you.
    <br>In fact, she's supposed to have committed suicide.
    <br>It's true, Man of God. She hasn't come home since 2014.
    <br>I don't know where she is.
    <br>Don't worry.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prophecy and Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Ok, it's alright.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Yes, indeed she is very very excited of what the Lord has done in her life
    <br>and she is here today to confirm the word of prophecy given to her by the man of God
    <br>and to testify to the glory of God.
    <br>My name is  Petunia Mnisi. I'm from South Africa.
    <br>I'm 55 years old.
    <br>The person next to me is my beautiful daughter  Makhadzi Chiparanganda.
    <br>The man of God prophesied to me. He gave me three prophecies.
    <br>The first one, he prayed for me.
    <br>He said, "Forgive". He said, "You didn't forgive. Forgive them".
    <br>I said, "It was painful".
    <br>"Are you ready to forgive them?"
    <br>I said, "It was painful, Man of God".
    <br>The second prophecy: I cried to the man of God concerning my daughter.
    <br>He said to me, "Did you know that she was supposed to commit suicide?"
    <br>He told me, "She will come back home".
    <br>The third prophecy: The man of God prophesied to me about a charm.
    <br>He said that I was using a charm last time but it was finished.
    <br>He said that they were putting honey inside.
    <br>Those prophecies, all of them were 100% true.
    <br>Concerning this forgiveness - it was painful for me; really, it was painful.
    <br>We were worshiping idols.
    <br>My father and my mother were traditional healers.
    <br>They gave us charms to bath with and food to eat.
    <br>In 1997 they said that my father was a wizard.
    <br>They called a community meeting. They beat and killed him.
    <br>After the death of my father, they said that my mother was also a witch.
    <br>They said that my mother sent my father to them to destroy their lives and their career.
    <br>My mother passed on. It was a sudden death.
    <br>After that, I introduced my children as I was worshiping idols, to a dangerous witch doctor.
    <br>She separated me from my daughter - this one.
    <br>She told my daughter that I am a witch.
    <br>My daughter was afraid. She ran away from home.
    <br>I tried to look for her but I didn't find her.
    <br>For four years, she was not coming home.
    <br>I tried to call her; she had blocked her phone.
    <br>People of God , I was looking for a solution.
    <br>Concerning that charm, it was 100% true.
    <br>I was using that charm to attract men.
    <br>Instead of attracting men, they were running away from me.
    <br>It is true, people of God; they ran away from me.
    <br>Even the father of this daughter, he ran away.
    <br>She doesn't know her father.
    <br>So you are confirming the prophecies of the man of God to be true.
    <br>It's true, 100% true.
    <br>So now after these prophecies you received on that day and the deliverance, what can you say now.
    <br>Have you released forgiveness from your heart?
    <br>Remember the man of God said you have not actually forgiven from your heart.
    <br>Have you now released that forgiveness?
    <br>Yes, I have already forgiven them.
    <br>Even my daughter we have already reconciled. She asked for forgiveness.
    <br>She came back home on the 22nd of July.
    <br>For the first time, I introduced her to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>This is my daughter.
    <br>Praise the Lord! Put your hands together for Jesus.
    <br>So you mean also in confirmation of the prophecy of the man of God, your daughter that had left you
    <br>for 4 good years, remember the man of God said you should not worry that her problem will be solved,
    <br>she will come back home. You mean she came back home?
    <br>Yes, she came back home. It was true. I was happy.
    <br>Wow, to the glory of God. Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Are you still visiting a spiritualist?
    <br>No, since 2016 when I was here, no charm in my home.
    <br>No charm for attracting men. I am just going to church.
    <br>I forgive them.
    <br>Wow, to God be the glory.
    <br>I'm watching Emmanuel TV, that is my father in the Lord.
    <br>To God be the glory. Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My name Makhadzi and I am from South Africa.
    <br>The person standing next to me is my beautiful mother.
    <br>It all started 2010 after I finished my matric.
    <br>My mother took me to school, she was paying for my school fees.
    <br>I was called in the morning by the principal saying that my school fees were not paid, they were behind.
    <br>I called my mother, she said I should come home.
    <br>When I went home, I thought maybe she would want to tell me
    <br>how we were going resolve the way of paying my school fees.
    <br>Instead she took me to a witch doctor.
    <br>The witch doctor allowed my sister, brother and mother to go outside and told me to sit.
    <br>She said your mother does not love you.
    <br>She is the one who wants to kill you.
    <br>She does not even care about you; now she wants to kill you.
    <br>and that's the reason why she stopped paying for your school fees.
    <br>As a daughter I don't know my father and the only person that I am supposed to talk to is my mum.
    <br>But then she used to have a big anger.
    <br>I wouldn't even communicate anything to her.
    <br>So after that, the spiritualist gave me food to eat, a charm and things to bath with.
    <br>After that I started changing, I became something else.
    <br>I went home.
    <br>I was thinking about everything she told me. I was afraid.
    <br>Because of that, I started experiencing suicidal thoughts; something was telling me, "Kill yourself".
    <br>But sometimes when I slept, another voice, a strong voice would come to me and say,
    <br>"You cannot die, this is not your grave".
    <br>And then after that, the fourth year - I didn't know what Emmanuel TV was.
    <br>I didn't even know what was happening. I didn't even know that there is a God.
    <br>I went to another herbalist again.
    <br>I said, "I'm struggling, there is no breakthrough in my life, I am seeking for a solution".
    <br>That herbalist told me, "Your mother now went to Nigeria to collect a huge, huge snake.
    <br>This snake is now going to swallow you, it's going to kill you".
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So at that point in time when you were told this: Did you know anything about Emmanuel TV then?
    <br>Did you know about The Synagogue Church in Nigeria?
    <br>I didn't even know that my mother went to Lagos.
    <br>I didn't even know what was God. I didn't even know Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So she told me she went to collect the snake; now she wants to kill me.
    <br>I should not go home at all.
    <br>That night when I slept, I heard a strong voice coming to me saying,
    <br>"You need to go home, you must go home".
    <br>In the morning I called my sister.
    <br>I asked her, "How are you?" She said, "I'm fine".
    <br>She said, "Thank God you called".
    <br>I was amazed why she was saying, "Thank God" because the only thing we knew was worshiping idols.
    <br>We never even mentioned God in our lives.
    <br>She said to me, "Our mother went to The SCOAN. Do you know about it?"
    <br>I said, "I don't know about it".
    <br>She said that she received a prophecy from Daddy T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He said there is a daughter that is going to come home and now you are expressing suicidal thoughts.
    <br>You were supposed to have killed yourself but you are going to come home.
    <br>She said to me, "Please come home.
    <br>Our mother does not even eat because of you, she is worried. We are all worried".
    <br>On the same day, I packed my things; then I went home.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Were you not surprised that something just made you
    <br>- you that had not even thought of going home for the past 4 years.
    <br>But after that voice spoke to you in the dream that you must go home, were you not surprised
    <br>that you just packed your things and went back home?
    <br>I was surprised because after that voice came, my body was changing; I felt relief in me.
    <br>So I packed my things and went back home.
    <br>I then asked for forgiveness from all my siblings and my mother.
    <br>We then reconciled and again I would like to take this opportunity to say, "Mummy, I'm so sorry, forgive me".
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I forgive you.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>How are things with the family now?
    <br>We have since reconciled. My mother is not angry anymore.
    <br>She loves me so much, I love her so much as well.
    <br>Are you still going about to spiritualists?
    <br>No, I don't. I now pray.
    <br>I pray to a living God which is the God of Daddy T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My God loves me so much because every time I pray, all my prayers are answered.
    <br>And are you still having...
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>To Go be the glory. Are you still having these suicidal thoughts?
    <br>No, I don't have them anymore. I actually want to live more years.
    <br>Wow, to God be the glory. Thank God Almighty for restoring back the family.
    <br>I want to say to the man of God and Emmanuel TV, "Thank you very much".
    <br>A word of advice from me, especially for ladies:
    <br>You know the pain of labour, we must love our children,
    <br>we must monitor them, we must take them to church and we must also introduce them to God.
    <br>We must not introduce our children to herbalists because I nearly lost my beautiful daughter.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My word of advice is to all mothers and fathers: Please, I beg you from the bottom of my heart.
    <br>Give your children love, love enough.
    <br>Love them so when they go outside, they know that their parents love them.
    <br>They won't go outside seeking for love elsewhere and also introduce them to God.
    <br>He can do it. No one else can do it but God.
    <br>To youth, all ladies and boys out there: Please listen to your parents and don't follow spiritualists.
    <br>Take yourself to God. You cannot do it by yourself, only God can do it.
    <br>I also want to thank Daddy T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Ever since I started praying with him, I started vomiting things.
    <br>I started receiving  my health, my good body. I feel so light right now.
    <br>I thank you, Daddy T.B. Joshua, for all your prayers and for your mentorship.
    <br>I pray more than my mother now, thank you so much.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>We also want to advise you that you should make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>and let God Almighty channel your way and it shall be well with you and your family, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
