  <p>    
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I pray we are such in heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I pray you are such in heart".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I pray you are such in heart.]
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you for your time; thank you for your faith.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are welcome to the presence of God.
    <br>Coming to the presence of God - it is like walking out of the darkness into the light.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Coming to the presence of God is like walking out of the darkness into the light".
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[Coming to the presence of God is like walking out of the darkness into the light.]
    <br>Are you in the presence of God?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>So, if you are in the presence of God, you know what I mean -
    <br>walking out of the darkness into the light.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Come and see the light
    <br>The light of God
    <br>Come and see the light
    <br>Amen Amen
    <br>Come and see the light
    <br>The light of God
    <br>Come and see the light
    <br>Amen Amen
    <br>You have walked out of the darkness - the fear of this, the fear of that.
    <br>Message Title:
    <br>FEAR WITHIN US
    <br>There are so many things that prevent us from being the kind of person God meant us to be.
    <br>You know you have been struggling to live right with God but something is preventing you -
    <br>fear of this, fear of that.
    <br>There are many fears today.
    <br>What is your own fear?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What is your own fear?"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[What is your own fear?]
    <br>There are many fears today - fear of this, fear of that.
    <br>What is your own fear?
    <br>Ask yourself this question. Ask yourself now, not even your neighbour:
    <br>What is my own fear?
    <br>Today, another fear has been added.
    <br>Where is the world going?
    <br>Another fear has been added.
    <br>Apart from the fear you have - fear of that, fear of poverty, fear of setback, failure, disappointment -
    <br>today another fear has been added.
    <br>Where is the world going?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>The fear today cannot even allow you to believe and trust your neighbour.
    <br>When your neighbour is coughing, you run away!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You cannot even give a handshake.
    <br>We Christians, believers, we say we are praying but fear is still within us.
    <br>We say we are praying but fear is still within us and prayer is about the heart, the spirit.
    <br>It is about within, not without.
    <br>You say you are praying but fear is still within you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, face your neighbour.
    <br>[You say you are praying but fear is still within you.]
    <br>What a prayer!
    <br>The Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness; we don't know how to pray.
    <br>It is all about heart, heart, heart.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>You say you are praying but fear is still within you.
    <br>You fight on the outside but on the inside you are filled with fear, panic and anxiety.
    <br>When trouble comes, you seem to be ignorant of your faith.
    <br>When trouble comes, "Where is my faith? Am I a Christian? Where is my God?"
    <br>You begin to look at God in a bad light.
    <br>Fear is a more deceptive enemy than satan.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is an enemy of fear.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Give thanks to Jesus for paying the price,
    <br>making us overcomers and interceding for us before the Father.
    <br>The same Holy Spirit is the One that sustained Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane.
    <br>He is an enemy of fear.
    <br>The prayer we are about to offer is not here but for the whole world
    <br>but you are only lucky to be here on the ground.
    <br>It is more powerful out there than here - the prayer we are about to offer.
    <br>All the doors opened to the enemy through which fear, oppression is entering into your life -
    <br>by the key of Moses we are going to shut it up.
    <br>Open your lips right now.
    <br>I want to see your heart.
    <br>By the key of Moses, key of David, we are going to shut it up!
    <br>Are you ready with me?
    <br>Open your lips right now.
    <br>Open your heart right now.
    <br>All the doors opened to the enemy through which fear, oppression is entering into your life -
    <br>by the key of David - right now begin to shut it up!
    <br>Lock it up!
    <br>I lock you up, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Lock it up!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>By the key of David, lock it up!
    <br>I lock you up, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>All powers that have been holding you down to where you do not belong -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Career failure - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Affliction, disease - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You need to understand what I'm saying.
    <br>I am out purposely because of this
    <br>and after this prayer you will know the reason why I am out today.
    <br>Listen.
    <br>All limitations passed on to you by your ancestors and predecessors -
    <br>in your family there is a certain age people die -
    <br>family cycle - no one does this, no one does that.
    <br>All limitations passed on to you by your ancestors, by your predecessors -
    <br>family sicknesses, family disease - the great grandfather died of this,
    <br>the grandfather died of the same sickness,
    <br>the father died of the same sickness... the cycle continues.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you with this - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Many of us have agreed that it is a way of life.
    <br>No, it is not a way of life.
    <br>The will of God is for us to prosper.
    <br>The will of God is for us to have good health.
    <br>The will of God is for us to be the head and not the tail. That is the will of God.
    <br>All limitations passed on to you by your ancestors, by your predecessors -
    <br>begin to break it, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Break it!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>That link, that chain.
    <br>Listen, I can see that chain breaking!
    <br>Chain of poverty, chain of stagnation, chain of setback, chain of career failure -
    <br>I can see that chain breaking!
    <br>Begin to act it right now.
    <br>Believe it.
    <br>I can see that chain breaking -
    <br>chain of stagnation, chain of disappointment, chain of affliction, sickness, disease, setback!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I can see the downfall of satan
    <br>Glory be to God
    <br>Glory be to Jesus
    <br>I can see the downfall of satan
    <br>Glory be to God
    <br>Amen
    <br>99% of what you are going through is as a result of ancestors, predecessors passing on to you.
    <br>Take you time to study your antecedents, track record of your family.
    <br>You have a record; you have a story to tell.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Cycle of life.
    <br>This is the reason why I am here.
    <br>When the world started nursing fear of this, fear of that, I knew this is from the Old Testament -
    <br>the same happened to your great, great grandfather.
    <br>To the New Testament -
    <br>the same story: fear.
    <br>To add more to your fear, to disturb your business, to disturb your career.
    <br>Your appointments - everything is at a standstill right now -
    <br>no more appointments, no more business.
    <br>You can't travel from one country to another - very difficult.
    <br>And when you are going through one border to another, they embarrass you.
    <br>Receive fresh baptism for your success in breakthrough!
    <br>Receive!
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>He is Lord Amen
    <br>He has risen from the dead
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>Every knee shall bow
    <br>Every tongue confess
    <br>That Jesus Christ is Lord
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>He is Lord Amen
    <br>He has risen from the dead
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>Every knee shall bow
    <br>Every tongue confess
    <br>That Jesus Christ is Lord
    <br>Jesus Christ said, "I pray your faith will not fail." This is the season.
    <br>The prophecy He gave centuries ago is manifesting now.
    <br>He said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>It means that something is coming that will challenge your faith.
    <br>Something will happen that you will not want to sit with your neighbour
    <br>because your neighbour will cough.
    <br>Something will happen and you will not want your neighbour to touch you
    <br>because you may be infected.
    <br>He said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>You know a thousand places all over the world where they could not come together
    <br>because of this - the temptation and trial that is going on.
    <br>Places of worship, places of this, places of that have been closed down
    <br>because of the situation on the ground.
    <br>This is a reflection of what Jesus was saying.
    <br>What a mighty God we serve
    <br>Heaven and earth adore Him
    <br>Angels bow before Him
    <br>What a mighty God we serve
    <br>This is what your ancestors have passed on to you and predecessors have passed on to you - fear.
    <br>Right now, begin to ask yourself
    <br>because I don't want you to leave here without anointing -
    <br>anointing that breaks the yoke.
    <br>Every yoke in your life must be broken!
    <br>You can't leave here without that anointing.
    <br>Ask yourself, "Am I anointed?"
    <br>If you are not anointed, your going back is at your risk.
    <br>"Am I anointed?"
    <br>You listened to my message last year that this is a very, very fearful year
    <br>and I came out at the beginning of this year to say that last year will end in March
    <br>and the year will continue to be very, very fearful till this month.
    <br>This month, 27th, it will be over.
    <br>By the end of this month, whether we like it or not - no matter the medicine
    <br>they might have produced to cure whatever, it will go the way it came.
    <br>If it is not medicine that brought this to the world, medicine cannot take it out.
    <br>It will go the way it came.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My concern now is not you; my concern is about your career.
    <br>You can't travel freely.
    <br>You can't go freely.
    <br>I know many places you do business; you can't go there.
    <br>Even if you go there, the embarrassment you will go through is too much.
    <br>People are now using this at every port of entry to embarrass people, all over the world.
    <br>Whether you like it or not.
    <br>It is not you per se but your career that we are talking about.
    <br>Your career and we cannot separate you from your career.
    <br>Your career is what we are talking about.
    <br>You need to travel outside your country, you need to move out,
    <br>your friends need to come to you, you need to go to your friends.
    <br>This is what life is all about but this satan has come.
    <br>You have children all over the world, your children are living in different countries.
    <br>Your family is in different countries - the peace of heart, concerning their peace.
    <br>This is what we are talking about.
    <br>This March - from now till 27th, you have to be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>The rain I talked about will continue today, tomorrow and it will just continue.
    <br>In the night, you will see what will happen.
    <br>If you say your country does not believe,
    <br>what of innocent people that are living in your country - believers?
    <br>But reason why I am here today is to clear the air, to let you know calmness has returned.
    <br>The same calmness will go round everywhere.
    <br>God loves you and I want to assure you, the viewers all over the world,
    <br>those who are under the influence of this prayer...
    <br>Take note of two prayers we offered today:
    <br>All powers that have been holding you down to where you do not belong.
    <br>You know where you belong - that is why you are not happy.
    <br>The power has been holding you down to where you do not belong.
    <br>When you are where you do not belong, you are not going to be happy; the joy is not there.
    <br>Sorrow, depression - that is why many of us are not happy because you are where you do not belong.
    <br>If you are where you belong, you will be happy.
    <br>That is why you are not happy - happy today, sorrow tomorrow.
    <br>And I am telling you today you have been delivered!
    <br>Satan knows you are not happy; anything he says, you will take it.
    <br>That is why - fear of this, fear of that.
    <br>But when you are happy, the joy of the Lord - no matter what happens,
    <br>no matter what comes, the joy of the Lord will be there.
    <br>Remember what I said when I first came: I said to you,
    <br>when we are in the presence of the Lord, it is like walking out of darkness into the light.
    <br>I am walking out of darkness to breakthrough, to salvation!
    <br>Give thanks to God. Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Right now, your country, whatever you have with you as a contact point.
    <br>Stretch your hand to your country.
    <br>Father, cover my nation with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Cover my nation with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Redeem my nation, redeem my leaders, in Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>- I can't hear you!
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Right now, commit yourself to the Lord.
    <br>Ask Him for His grace - you need His grace to live, to look, wherever you go.
    <br>Right now, you want to maintain your life, holiness, faithfulness, kindness.
    <br>All that you have seen today is enough for you to live the rest of your life.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace to be the hearer and the doer.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>- I can't hear you!
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>How do you know you are one of the people God has anointed now?
    <br>You know you are one of the people that has been anointed.
    <br>Anointed to do what?
    <br>Anointing to lead you, for a new beginning, a new direction, a new way.
    <br>I want to agree with you.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me Your channel - Your channel of faithfulness.
    <br>Make me Your Channel, Lord - Your channel of love.
    <br>Make me Your channel - Your channel of holiness, uprightness.
    <br>Make me Your channel - Your channel of obedience.
    <br>Make me Your channel - Your channel of shining light.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Father, we ask for Your strength for our journey back home.
    <br>We ask for Your strength, grace, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The grace of God is sufficient.
    <br>When you have this grace - where you are weak, you are strong;
    <br>where you are poor, you are rich.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>You say, "I am weak" but you are strong.
    <br>That is the grace Paul the Apostle was relying on.
    <br>So you need that grace.
    <br>Ask for the grace -
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
