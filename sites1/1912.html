    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>Viewers all over the world: 
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Day by day, we continue to receive from God the fruits of His mercy,
    <br>and witness the evidence that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever,
    <br>as the Bible says in Hebrews 13:8.
    <br>Indeed viewers, the age of miracles has not yet past.
    <br>The Miracle Worker is still alive; His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>He is still working wonders today and He is even more powerful in distance.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>As we said during our last programme,
    <br>we will be sharing with you one by one testimonies from those who have received healing
    <br>from the deadly virus COVID-19 during the 'Distance is not a barrier'
    <br>interactive prayer sessions.
    <br>And today we are going to listen to a wonderful, faith building testimony
    <br>from a couple all the way in Central America.
    <br>First and foremost, we want you to watch the screen
    <br>and witness what happened during their supernatural miracle
    <br>that took place during the last interactive prayer session on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Let us watch.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Fidel Ortiz Moreno & Family
    <br>Honduras
    <br>My name is Fidel Ortiz.
    <br>She is my wife, Sindy and they are my children.
    <br>This is our testimony.
    <br>In May, when my wife was about to give birth to our baby, we rushed to hospital.
    <br>Once in hospital, they asked her to do a test for COVID-19, as a requirement.
    <br>To our surprise, the test confirmed that my wife was COVID-19 positive.
    <br>Because she tested positive, they immediately took her to an isolation section where she delivered the baby.
    <br>When my wife was discharged from hospital, they did not allow her to carry the baby
    <br>because she was COVID-19 positive.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>Three days later, in order for me to take the baby home, I was also asked to do the COVID-19 test.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>To my surprise, I was also confirmed COVID-19 positive.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19

    <br>Finally, the hospital sent us home to be quarantined there.
    <br>We experienced symptoms.
    <br>My wife had bone pain, a sore throat and fever.
    <br>We were seriously affected by COVID-19.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>Before the prayer, I did another test that also confirmed I was COVID-19 positive.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>Here are the reports.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>This is the result of the second test I did and it shows that I was COVID-19 positive.
    <br>The result of the first test I did; I tore it out of frustration but I have a picture on my phone.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>This result confirms that I was COVID-19 positive.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>While searching on the internet, I found out about Emmanuel TV and decided to send them an email.
    <br>Thank God, they received our email and called us back through a video call.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>Through this video call, the Emmanuel TV Team prayed for us.
    <br>During the prayer, I felt like fire on my hands and my wife felt the same all over her body.
    <br>It was the fire of the Holy Spirit working and being manifested in our lives.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>Indeed, we have an Almighty God - a God who can do all things.
    <br>After the prayer, I went to the toilet and started vomiting.
    <br>As I was vomiting, I felt that something in me was being uprooted.
    <br>When I finished vomiting, the throat pain I was experiencing disappeared and I was healed!
    <br>Jesus heals!
    <br>This is the evidence that Jesus healed me after the prayer!
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>This is the letter from the hospital that says I am able to go back to work because I am healed.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>My children are also free to the glory of Jesus Christ!
    <br>We want to advise people to choose faith over fear.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>We should not be afraid of this sickness.
    <br>In the world, there is COVID-19 but we have Jesus Christ!
    <br>Jesus died on the Cross of Calvary for us and paid the price for us.
    <br>He paid the price for my healing and your healing as well.
    <br>Healed Of COVID-19
    <br>Interactive Prayer Testimony
    <br>He paid the debt for you.
    <br>You can also receive your healing if you believe in Jesus Christ.
    <br>Connect with Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Men and women of God with great anointing from above will pray for you.
    <br>Remember, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>As you are seeing our testimony, you will also receive your healing, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Rejoice with my family because we are healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>God is powerful!
    <br>Christ lives and still heals!
    <br>Sindy Guerra & Family
    <br>Honduras
    <br>I want to thank God for His favour and mercy.
    <br>When I gave birth to my baby, I was tested and confirmed to be positive for COVID-19.
    <br>Because of that, I was isolated from my family and it was so hard for me not to be with my baby.
    <br>After receiving prayers from Emmanuel TV, I did a test for COVID-19 once more
    <br>and I was negative.
    <br>Thank God, I am healed and now, I can stay with my family.
    <br>Thank God, it is true.
    <br>It is part of the testimony and this is my wife's result.
    <br>It is written IgG Positive and IgM Negative.
    <br>This means that she had COVID-19 but she is negative now.
    <br>This is what the doctors explained to us.
    <br>We thank God because we are healed!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>I am no longer a slave to fear
    <br>I am a child of God
    <br>Viewers, from a scientific angle; this is a positive medical report for COVID-19.
    <br>Scientifically also, this is a negative medical report for COVID-19.
    <br>So, both scientifically and spiritually, this is clear evidence.
    <br>What else again?
    <br>There are no natural words to describe it, except to say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>So viewers, as the Bible says in Genesis 18:14:
    <br>Is there anything too hard for the Lord?
    <br>No. To God's power nothing, absolutely nothing is impossible.
    <br>And viewers, when you realise this,
    <br>when you realise that God is reliable, your faith will simultaneously grow.
    <br>Faith is holding on to what God has said.
    <br>Faith is believing exactly what God has said He will do.
    <br>What a means of blessing is the look of faith to Jesus.
    <br>There is light, life, guidance, perfect health, in fact, everything!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Viewers, remember, we treat but God heals.
    <br>So let us be sure to include God in all our decisions.
    <br>God bless you and once again:
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
