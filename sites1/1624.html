    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>My name is Amanda, I came from the USA.
    <br>I just want to explain how I was born again through Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>It all started when I was really young.
    <br>I loved Jesus, I knew Jesus when I was a really young kid.
    <br>Then, as I got older, around 14, I started having problems in my life, and I started to doubt God,
    <br>I started to think that; "How could there be a God, if all these bad things can happen to me?"
    <br>So, I sort of denounced Jesus as a young child.
    <br>Right after that my problems got worse.
    <br>I started cutting myself with razors, doing drugs, drinking alcohol, rebelling against my parents.
    <br>I just went insane, I was put in mental hospitals all the time.
    <br>In the course of that I became suicidal and I tried to commit suicide all the time.
    <br>Even the doctors would say...
    <br>They would take my blood after I had taken so many drugs in an attempted suicide
    <br>and they would say, "I don't know how you are alive, but you are alive".
    <br>I would just say that I will just try again tomorrow; I was persistent.
    <br>I was always afraid of shooting myself with a gun, because I wanted to go in a much calmer way.
    <br>I also started dealing drugs in the US, like marijuana.
    <br>When I was doing that, along the lines, one day a voice spoke to me and said
    <br>that I would get robbed in this car with these people.
    <br>I didn't understand because this voice speaking to my heart, it felt like God.
    <br>I was like, "I don't believe in God, so how could this be?" but it turned out that I did get robbed.
    <br>I went to a friend's house and I knocked on the door.
    <br>I was like, "If my friend doesn't answer the door, I'm going to jump in front of a car and kill myself".
    <br>But she answered the door and I got home safely.
    <br>I wasn't ready to give my life to God, or to believe in God, or to know God was real;
    <br>I was too busy doing wordly things, so I put it away in my memories,
    <br>I locked it away for another time.
    <br>Then, I got even worse.
    <br>I started to actually think about committing suicide with a gun.
    <br>I remember what happened with the gun, and how a voice spoke to me that might have been God.
    <br>I started to question, "If I died, where would I was going to go?
    <br>Am I going to go to some place like 'no place' or am I going to a place worse than this?"
    <br>So, I just needed to know before I did this act, "Is He real?"
    <br>So, I started seeking on the internet; because when I was younger I experienced demonic attacks.
    <br>It's funny because when I denounced Jesus, the attacks stopped.
    <br>They would attack me at night; they would scare me, and they stopped when I denounced Jesus.
    <br>But I did know that demons were real.
    <br>I went on the internet because I used to play with a satanic things like ouija boards...
    <br>How did you discover Emmanuel TV that led to your deliverance?
    <br>When I was on YouTube, looking to see...
    <br>I wanted to hear demons say that God was real, because even the Bible says that
    <br>demons acknowledge the existence of God.
    <br>The very next thing that came up on Youtube was "Deliverances through Emmanuel TV".
    <br>I was intrigued by it.
    <br>But I always thought, "Maybe this could be fake. Maybe it is not real -
    <br>the healing, the deliverances, the testimonies - it could have all been faked".
    <br>But I kept watching; I ate, slept and breathed this Emmanuel TV, trying to figure it out.
    <br>I saw the good deeds that Prophet T.B. Joshua was doing.
    <br>The love that I saw out of this church - through all my life I've never really seen real love,
    <br>only the love that is temporary or selfish.
    <br>I just started to want to be a part of this, and a part of God.
    <br>What really touched me was the Word of God that Prophet T.B. Joshua teaches -
    <br>the Words of love and hope and who Jesus is.
    <br>Through that I began to change and I started listening and even praying.
    <br>At some point along the way, I found myself in my bathroom, thinking,
    <br>"God, I really want to be a part of this".
    <br>I was just speaking to Jesus, not in a church but in my bathroom,
    <br>"I don't know if You can hear me, I don't know if You are real, but these people seem happy,
    <br>I want to be a part of this."
    <br>I told it myself.
    <br>I was speaking to Him saying, "I'm a bad person; I lie, I steal, I cheat - I'm terrible."
    <br>I was like, "God, I'm just going to fix myself and then I'll come to You."
    <br>But then, at that moment, Jesus spoke to me, and He said to me,
    <br>"No, I will make you perfect" - because it is His work, not mine.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>When you started watching Emmanuel TV, your life started changing.
    <br>For the first time you believed God.
    <br>- Right?
    <br>- Yes!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My advice for people is, "If you are going through a hard time in life, and you started to doubt God,
    <br>I just want people to know that living life without God is not easier, and He is not your enemy.
    <br>He loves you, He wants good things for you. Jesus loves you."
    <br>That is the most important thing I want people to know;
    <br>it is so much harder in life to be without knowing that love of God.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean, you are totally delivered, no more suicidal thoughts,
    <br>and all those demonic spirits that caused you unbelief and all that?
    <br>Yes, when that happened, I felt the spiritual heaviness that was causing all of that,
    <br>to be pushed down into my feet, and I was free to praise God.
    <br>My heart was free; I have never felt so light in all my life.
    <br>From the morning that I woke up, I knew that God was real because He set me free.
    <br>It's amazing!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus one more time!
    <br>These are the cuts, scars on my legs from when I used to cut myself and do drugs,
    <br>like I have some on my arm.
    <br>Basically, that's what I would do and that was terrible - I would bleed for days and days.
    <br>I would keep doing it; I would cut myself hundreds of times a day - I liked it.
    <br>It was strange.
    <br>All these are over now?
    <br>Yes, I do not do that.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life, for this wonderful deliverance you have received
    <br>through watching Emmanuel TV, listening to the message of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Now, that the Lord Almighty has set you free;
    <br>the Bible says those who are delivered by Christ's Word must be ruled by His Word.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to make His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>so that your deliverance will be permanent, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus one more time!
