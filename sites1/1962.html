    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Outside The SCOAN you can see a car parked by the gate.
    <br>Inside the car is a young girl with a broken leg.
    <br>Ten years old, Miss Elizabeth Matthias cannot walk due to the broken bone in her right leg.
    <br>BROKEN BONES START MOVING DURING PRAYER!!!
    <br>Pressed against the window, you can see the x-ray which shows the severity of her pitiful condition.
    <br>As you can see, both bones in her right leg are broken.
    <br>Let us hear from her and her mother.
    <br>My name is Evelyn Matthias, from Delta State.
    <br>The little girl in the car - can you tell us who she is to you?
    <br>She is my daughter, Elizabeth.
    <br>She cannot walk due to a broken bone.
    <br>I carry her up and down, to the toilet, to the bathroom.
    <br>She used to help me before but now, she cannot help me.
    <br>She cannot walk.
    <br>I cannot go to work because of her.
    <br>She cannot go to school at all.
    <br>A friend introduced me to The SCOAN.
    <br>So, I brought her here.
    <br>Now, that you are here today, what is your belief?
    <br>I believe that my daughter will walk.
    <br>God will do it.
    <br>Can you please tell us your name, your age and where you come from?
    <br>My name is Elizabeth Matthias.
    <br>I am ten years old.
    <br>I come from Delta State.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is that I cannot walk due to a broken bone.
    <br>I was standing at the bus stop.
    <br>So, the motorcycle came and hit me.
    <br>I can't do anything at home. I can't go to school. I can't wash plates.
    <br>I can't help my mummy to clean the house, sweep the floor or wash the clothes at home,
    <br>because I can't walk.
    <br>Now, that you are at The SCOAN today, can you tell us what your belief is?
    <br>I believe that God is going to heal me and I will walk with my legs.
    <br>We are going to attend to the sick ones; they are waiting for healing.
    <br>The man of God announces that it is time for healing.
    <br>When it is God's appointed time for something to happen in your life,
    <br>nothing can hold it back.
    <br>Jesus Christ healed and still heals all manner of sickness and disease.
    <br>Under the influence of the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua begins to pray
    <br>for those gathered at the prayer line.
    <br>Man of God, help us please!
    <br>Due to broken bone, my daughter cannot walk.
    <br>She had an accident.
    <br>Please, man of God, help us.
    <br>Due to broken bone, my daughter cannot walk.
    <br>I used to carry her to the toilet; she cannot go to school.
    <br>Man of God, please, help us, sir.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua begins to pray for Miss Elizabeth Matthias in the powerful name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The resurrection power of our Lord Jesus Christ is working in the Spirit
    <br>to bring about her perfect and complete healing.
    <br>Watch, as we see that prayer is the remedy for every malady.
    <br>Look at the leg shaking under the influence of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>as the anointed man of God stretches forth his hand.
    <br>You can see that leg shaking, confirming the presence of life.
    <br>They have taken her to many places in search of solution, to no avail.
    <br>All efforts proved to be of no avail.
    <br>But right now, see what is happening.
    <br>Before our very eyes God Almighty is restoring the leg of that little girl, just ten years of age.
    <br>I am healed.
    <br>Jesus is my Healer.
    <br>The Bible says our confession gives us possession.
    <br>She confessed Jesus Christ is her Healer.
    <br>Now, she possesses perfect healing, proving that the evidence of God's miracle
    <br>is our rising and walking.
    <br>She could not walk before.
    <br>Now, she can walk.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I can walk now.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>My daughter can walk now.
    <br>BROKEN BONES START MOVING DURING PRAYER!!!
    <br>My daughter could not walk before.
    <br>Now, she can walk freely.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>She can walk now.
    <br>Thank You, Father.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>There is that little girl.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I am free now.
    <br>She has been unable to walk and you can see the bandage
    <br>tied around the leg because of the broken bone.
    <br>She could not help herself, she could not walk without the support of her parents.
    <br>Right now, you can see, after the prayer of the anointed man of God, her leg has been restored.
    <br>BROKEN BONES START MOVING DURING PRAYER!!!
    <br>She can walk now.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>She can walk now. 
    <br>Before she could not walk.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>She can walk now.
    <br>Here, we can see two images of Elizabeth - before and after the prayer of the man of God, T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And you will see that the power of our Lord Jesus Christ has not stopped
    <br>just because He is no longer visible in our midst.
    <br>His power and effectiveness are even greater today,
    <br>because He can be in all places at all times, through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>My name is Evelyn Matthias.
    <br>My daughter's name is Elizabeth Matthias.
    <br>What brought us to The SCOAN was a motor bike accident.
    <br>She broke her leg.
    <br>She could not walk, she could not go to school, she could not do anything on her own.
    <br>I am the one that carried her up and down.
    <br>A friend introduced me to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I came here, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for her.
    <br>Since that time, she can walk.
    <br>She can go to school, she can do anything.
    <br>She is the one that walks.
    <br>I am no more carrying her.
    <br>Today, I feel very happy.
    <br>When you look at me, you will know that I feel very happy.
    <br>I promise to God to train her in the way of the Lord.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in your life.
    <br>Can we hear from your daughter, because we believe she has something to say?
    <br>My name is Elizabeth Matthias. 
    <br>I am ten years old.
    <br>I come from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problems that brought me to The SCOAN is that I had a broken bone so I couldn't walk.
    <br>It is my parents that carried me up and down.
    <br>My parents helped me to do what I was supposed to do at home.
    <br>I couldn't go to school; I couldn't bath my brothers.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me and now I can walk very well.
    <br>I can do what I am supposed to do at home and I can go to school.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ?
    <br>- Are you having any pain?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Could you tap it like this before?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Why?
    <br>- Because I was having pain.
    <br>- But as now you are tapping - are you having any pain?
    <br>- No.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ?

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Brothers and sisters, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Appolonia Ezeugwu.
    <br>I am from Enugu State and I reside in Nasarawa State.
    <br>This is my in-law.
    <br>It was on 5th April 2011, I had an accident.
    <br>They rushed me to the specialist hospital.
    <br>These are the pictures from where I'd been on the bed.
    <br>After four months, they discharged me on a wheelchair.
    <br>While they discharged me on a wheelchair, I was lamenting in my heart.
    <br>I asked my doctor, "Can't you give my crutches?"
    <br>When I see somebody on a wheelchair, it is as if there was no other hope.
    <br>I said, please, try and give me crutches.
    <br>They said, madam, you don't even know what happened to you.
    <br>Neither of your legs can help you now.
    <br>It was better on the wheelchair as they couldn't manage anything.
    <br>So, I accepted it.
    <br>I left. I went home.
    <br>My loving husband, too dear to me, knowing what I was passing through,
    <br>sitting in one place, no movement.
    <br>I couldn't come out of my room.
    <br>He decided to buy a decoder and put Emmanuel TV for me to keep me alive
    <br>because that is where my miracle came from.
    <br>I was watching Emmanuel TV day and night.
    <br>Even when there was no light, I made sure to buy generator fuel.
    <br>It is a 24 hour station.
    <br>There is no day they have a break.
    <br>So I was busy every day, seeing what God was doing - miraculous works!
    <br>I was asking my husband how we could come to The SCOAN so I'd be healed.
    <br>He said no way.
    <br>If it was by flight, it would be very costly.
    <br>If by car that is ten hours journey; I couldn't stay in a car like that.
    <br>So, I was praying in my heart, "God, Your will be done" until that fateful day.
    <br>I was busy watching Emmanuel TV; I saw a similar case to mine.
    <br>When I saw the x-ray, it was the tibia and fibula - the same problem I had.
    <br>I said to myself that if that girl stood up, I too would stand up and walk.
    <br>While I was praying, I saw the man of God coming out because she was in a car.
    <br>I was watching them.
    <br>As the man of God came, he was stretching his hand and her leg began to shake.
    <br>So, I stretched my leg out as best as I could.
    <br>I began to follow up.
    <br>The girl didn't know what was happening.
    <br>I was the one connecting in spirit
    <br>because before she could open her mouth to say, "Amen," I had shouted, "Amen!"
    <br>When he said, "Come out," the girl was coming out.
    <br>I tried to balance because I could not allow that miracle to leave me behind.
    <br>So, I was balancing in a wheelchair.
    <br>You know how a wheelchair is.
    <br>I was just balancing there.
    <br>As I saw the girl stand up, with righteous anger in me, I didn't call anyone to help me.
    <br>I just held onto something.
    <br>As I stood up with that righteous anger, something like a cloth fell on me.
    <br>I felt something fall off, so I bent down to see what fell but I didn't see anything.
    <br>As I raised my head, the Spirit said, "You are standing up, madam. Are you feeling pain?"
    <br>Then, I knew what happened.
    <br>I screamed. I said, "My leg does not hurt!"
    <br>So, my husband came out.
    <br>My son was standing while this was happening.
    <br>Before the girl could stand and balance, I had moved a step.
    <br>I moved and moved until I reached the television and touched it.
    <br>BROKEN BONES START MOVING DURING PRAYER!!!
    <br>As I touched the television, I came back to where the chair was.
    <br>I wondered, was this a miracle or a dream.
    <br>I jumped outside.
    <br>As I was going outside, my neighbour who heard the shout of 'praise the Lord'
    <br>was coming to see what had happened.
    <br>We met by the door entrance.
    <br>She was singing and I was going out with a song.
    <br>BROKEN BONES START MOVING DURING PRAYER!!!
    <br>So, she joined the chorus and the neighbours began to gather.
    <br>That was how we danced and danced, until today, to the glory of God.
    <br>BROKEN BONES START MOVING DURING PRAYER!!!
    <br>To the glory of God, I am now standing in your presence.
    <br>You can see me - a living testimony of Emmanuel TV!
    <br>We want to congratulate you for the honour you have for God and the fear of God you have.
    <br>There are many people that have this kind of deliverance and healing
    <br>but they keep it to themselves.
    <br>But because she has the fear of God and she honours God, honours the Prophet,
    <br>she is also to receive a Prophet's reward.
    <br>She came all the way from her state just to share her testimony,
    <br>coming out to tell the world what God has done for her - it is another miracle.
    <br>So, you will receive that miracle separately.
    <br>Because the Bible says the transgressors will be converted,
    <br>and they will be confessing, "Jesus is Lord", when they see the testimony.
    <br>Now, she has shared her testimony - this testimony will affect 'trillion' people over the world.
    <br>While many have this kind of testimony and they keep it to themselves.
    <br>This is real, when you look at it.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>That will be a lesson to others all over the world, that have similar testimonies,
    <br>and have decided not to come forward to share it.
    <br>So, you are still coming back again to share another testimony.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Testimony that you came forward to tell the world what God has done for you -
    <br>that testimony is different, you are coming back to share this one.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank you very much.
