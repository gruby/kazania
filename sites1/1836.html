    <br>During this critical time, Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world
    <br>have risen to the challenge to plant love and care in the lives of those who need it most.
    <br>The nation of Israel was not left out.
    <br>In response to the need to purchase medical equipment to help treat those affected by the sickness.
    <br>in the Galilee Medical Center, the largest hospital in the Galilee region of northern Israel,
    <br>TB Joshua and Emmanuel TV presented a cheque of 100,000 shekels (30,000 dollars)
    <br>to the CEO of the Galilee Medical Center, Dr Masad Barhoum.
    <br>My name is Dr Barhoum; I am the CEO of the Galilee Medical Center.
    <br>It is the largest hospital in the Galilee region, with 723 beds.
    <br>I would like to thank you and appreciate your donation to the hospital.
    <br>It will help the staff and the patients to cope with the disease.
    <br>Thank you again and thanks especially to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I would like to one day see you here in Israel.
    <br>Overwhelmed at the donation, the hospital published an article in appreciation on their official Facebook page.
    <br>Galilee Medical Center wrote:
    <br>Good news in difficult times - thank you to the Emmanuel Global Network for the generous donation.
    <br>Galilee Medical Center is grateful to receive some substantive and meaningful contributions
    <br>to strengthen us and to help us fight the pandemic.
    <br>The Emmanuel Global Network, a Christian organization with five branches worldwide,
    <br>generously contributed 100,000 Israeli shekels to support us in our efforts
    <br>to provide medical care to the residents of northern Israel.
    <br>Three members of the association (who asked to remain anonymous out of modesty)
    <br>met with Dr Masad Barhoum, Director of the Medical Center, and gave him a cheque
    <br>towards the purchase of life-saving equipment.
    <br>They said, "Galilee Medical Center serves a diverse population of different religions and sectors -
    <br>Jews, Christians, Muslims and Druze â€“
    <br>and, it is an honour for us to contribute to your efforts to fight this epidemic."
    <br>Dr Barhoum said, "Every shekel we receive helps us combat the sickness;
    <br>Thankfully there are organizations like yours that are helping us during this difficult time."
    <br>The hospital also sent an official letter of appreciation to T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>To Mr T.B. Joshua, Emmanuel TV:
    <br>Dear Friends, I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation and thank you
    <br>for reaching out to the Galilee Medical Center during this time of crisis.
    <br>The sickness outbreak is a new worldwide phenomenon, affecting all of us -
    <br>in Israel and worldwide, causing disruption and uncertainty for our families and our communities.
    <br>Galilee Medical Center is located in the City of Nahariya in the Western Galilee.
    <br>It is the only Medical Center in the region, and we dedicatedly serve a diverse population
    <br>of 600,000 Jews, Moslems, Christians and Druze.
    <br>Our strategic location, only six miles from the hostile Lebanese border, has already required us in the past
    <br>to rapidly adjust to emergency situations, including treating 3,000 wounded Syrians
    <br>who crossed the border seeking for medical help.
    <br>During this time, as the virus continues to threaten the population,
    <br>the hospital's professional staff immediately rose to the challenge.
    <br>Two virus wards have already been set up to receive patients
    <br>and a third Ward will soon be opened.
    <br>The Emmanuel Global Network gift is highly needed and appreciated, and will be used to purchase
    <br>medical equipment for our Wards to fight the disease and strengthen our community.
    <br>Thank you again for your gift, it is highly valued.
    <br>Cordially, Dr Masad Barhoum, CEO Galilee Medical Center.
    <br>The beauty of life does not depend on how happy we are but on how happy others can be because of us.
