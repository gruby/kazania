    <br>Visitors have come from far and wide to experience God and experience God they did
    <br>as the power of God has descended and is busy removing any demonic influence
    <br>in the lives of these people.
    <br>Watch as they stumble and fall as prayer is offered in the name above all names, Jesus Christ.
    <br>She has a suicide spirit. Come on.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus'  Name
    <br>My name is Aushrine. I am from Lithuania.
    <br>What the man of God prophesied to me is true. I have a suicide spirit.
    <br>My dad committed suicide
    <br>and other members of my family are always speaking about suicide.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>The prophecy is true.
    <br>From my childhood, I have had suicidal thoughts.
    <br>I want to be delivered.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus'  Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us -  Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Mrs Aushrine Andrieke
    <br>Lithuania
    <br>My name is Aushrine Andrieke, I came from Lithuania with my family.
    <br>This is my husband, this is my daughter.
    <br>Prophecy/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied to me that there is a man in my family that committed suicide.
    <br>It's true and I want to confirm that it was totally true about my life and my family.
    <br>Prophecy/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Since my father killed himself 20 years, the thought of suicide was visiting me
    <br>and from teenage age I was thinking about suicide
    <br>and also depression was very strong in my life.
    <br>Prophecy/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>That force also started in the life of my mother and my sisters.
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied into my life and I got my deliverance, this curse left all my family.
    <br>Prophecy/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Before my deliverance I was also tormented by nightmares
    <br>and for a long time, I also had insomnia in my life.
    <br>Prophecy/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>But today I'm delivered by the ministry of T.B. Joshua and I have enjoyed my life
    <br>and I came back here with my family.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Now for the benefit of the listeners all over the world, you said according to the message of prophecy,
    <br>the man of God said you had a spirit of suicide and someone committed suicide in your family
    <br>and you confirmed by saying it was your father that committed suicide and died
    <br>and this thought of suicide was troubling you.
    <br>Apart from that, you also had insomnia and other problems like evil attacks, you couldn't sleep.
    <br>Can you tell us, after the deliverance right now, do you still have that thought of suicide,
    <br>do you still have those sleepless nights?
    <br>Prophecy/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>No thoughts of suicide, no depression. I'm living my life full of joy.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prophecy/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I want to advise the viewers all over the world that they have to seek God first
    <br>because only He delivers and sets free.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Ritis, I'm her husband.
    <br>So I declare that what was told before, it was absolutely true.
    <br>The insomnia is gone, the nightmares are gone.
    <br>She sleeps like a baby, better than me.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Besides that, she had a huge pain in her back.
    <br>Sometimes it was just like a chain, she could not even take off or tie her shoes or just go to the toilet.
    <br>Right now it is gone.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus once again.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>I was involved in martial arts, I practised it a lot - for more than five years.
    <br>I have lots of degrees, diplomas and so on.
    <br>We have a lot of books about spiritual life, information knowledge but not about Jesus Christ.
    <br>During that period when she was in The SCOAN, she declared to me about all these things
    <br>that were not positive at all - the martial arts is from the demonic world.
    <br>I just made a decision, collected all my belongings, all books
    <br>and put them in one place in my garage.
    <br>When she returned, we just burnt it, we cleared our house of it all.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>You heard this wonderful testimony, how the deliverance of his wife
    <br>also brought about total deliverance to him and the entire family.
    <br>He said he was into martial arts and then he was serving a lot of spirits but not the Spirit of God.
    <br>Though he said he wanted to serve God, he realised that he was serving God in a wrong way.
    <br>He was not following the Word of truth; not until the wife came and received deliverance
    <br>and also brought his picture to The SCOAN the very day she came.
    <br>He realised that after the wife received deliverance, something came out of him
    <br>and that motivated him - all the books he was reading about,
    <br>occultic books and those books that are not of God -
    <br>he came together with the entire family and the wife and burnt everything.
    <br>He said right now, the entire family has accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour
    <br>and they are not worshiping any other God except Jesus.
    <br>Prophecy/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>What you should do: just little steps forward and Jesus will do the rest.
    <br>Amen. You heard it all. Jesus Christ is the solution to all fundamental issues of life
    <br>and He can never abandon those who seek Him in truth and in faith.
    <br>We pray that the Lord Jesus Christ who has brought this family together 
    <br>will continue to guide you and protect you
    <br>and your blessing, deliverance and miracle will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ once again.
