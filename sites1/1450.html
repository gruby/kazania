    <br>PARAGUAY CRUSADE
    <br>WITH TB JOSHUA
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Maria Noémi Fernández Coronel, and I am from Paraguay.
    <br>I had a stomach problem, constipation and was unable to pass wind.
    <br>I had a moving object in the stomach, like a live creature.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>This problem started when I was in my mother's womb.
    <br>My mum told me that when she was pregnant with me,
    <br>she was given something to drink that burnt her throat
    <br>and for some months during the pregnancy, she was unable to eat.

    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>According to my mother, when I was born, I had pimples on my head.
    <br>When they squeezed the pimples, what came out was like a worm.
    <br>They were not able to diagnose the problem.

    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When I was seven years old, I developed an eating disorder.
    <br>I could only eat one spoon of food during meals. If I ate more than that, I would vomit it.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>My mother took me to different doctors who gave me antiparasitic medication and vitamins.
    <br>She also took my urine to a herbalist who gave her a syrup for me to drink.

    <br>When I was 17 years old, I noticed something in my stomach that disturbed me.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Due to the problem I was having, I could stay for 15 or 22 days without defecating
    <br>and this was very painful.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I was taken to different doctors and underwent several treatments.
    <br>Any time the doctors examined me, they could feel something in my stomach
    <br>but tests could not detect what it was.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I had a swollen belly.
    <br>The doctors couldn't diagnose my problem so my family took me to a herbalist.
    <br>After going to the herbalist three times,
    <br>he told my mother there was nothing else he could do.
    <br>The medical doctors and herbalists could not explain what my problem was.
    <br>My weight dropped from 45 kgs to about 28 kgs.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>My friends asked what was happening to me as they could see that though I ate a lot,
    <br>I was losing weight.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I learnt about the coming of Prophet T.B. Joshua to Paraguay through radio and television.
    <br>After I watched his videos on YouTube, my faith grew and I knew I would be healed.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>On Sunday after the Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua in Paraguay,
    <br>I could defecate without any medication or laxative.
    <br>I thank Jesus and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When I was about to receive prayer from the man of God,
    <br>I started feeling a very strong pain in my stomach.
    <br>I started shaking and couldn't hold myself.
    <br>So, I sat down and when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, he touched my head and stomach
    <br>and I began to vomit.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I feel so light. I'm delivered and happy.
    <br>Now I can defecate normally without medication.
    <br>Not being able to defecate is the worst thing that could happen to anybody
    <br>because you will be in pain and easily get irritated.
    <br>You will become nervous and would not be able to interact with people.
    <br>Now I am very happy. I'm no longer disturbed. I am free from pain.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>My advice is: Have faith in God.
    <br>Only through faith can one be healed and delivered.
    <br>Testimony From Day 2 Of The Paraguay
    <br>Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Glory be to God! Thank You, Lord Jesus, for healing me!
