  <p>    
    <br>I have disc protrusion and degenerative arthritis.
    <br>I have been smoking for a long time.
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>My heart is...
    <br>I am yearning, crawling like a baby to know Jesus, to love Jesus and to have a free spirit.
    <br>Are you free now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That is the state of your heart?
    <br>I'm free.
    <br>What of this issue of your husband you are carrying?
    <br>We divorced.
    <br>That's what I am saying.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is second disappointment.
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>She says, "I love Jesus" - this is how you people lie against Jesus.
    <br>What is the state of your heart?
    <br>Those things you carry – you never let it go.
    <br>"My husband, I divorced, my husband, I have no husband..."
    <br>These are the causes of the sickness.
    <br>Those things cause you unforgiveness, bitterness, and those things will not let you sleep.
    <br>You will not be able to sleep unless you take a drug.
    <br>Look at my sister's face - with a beautiful face, you think she is happy, but she is not happy.
    <br>I confirm the Word of God.
    <br>That is why I brought her from London.
    <br>It has been war but glory be to God.
    <br>That is the real thing.
    <br>She takes medicine every three hours.
    <br>Look at her appearance, face - beautiful; but this is created happiness and joy.
    <br>This is the life everyone lives today.
    <br>She is lonely and that has caused depression, suicide thoughts.
    <br>I am so angry and I am looking after my kids by myself.
    <br>He is not supporting me.
    <br>I have got this anger that if it were not for my kids, I don’t know what I would have done.
    <br>There is a debt now that you are facing.
    <br>Man of God, I covered this up so that I can be happy.
    <br>Otherwise, I am breaking down in pieces.
    <br>Physically, my body is just torn apart into pieces.
    <br>In my heart, I am having palpitations.
    <br>I can have a heart attack at anytime.
    <br>There was a form you filled on the internet.
    <br>It was a spiritualist that was contacting you over time but it is like you have withdrawn.
    <br>He is not a pastor or a man of God.
    <br>You are gradually about to join the cult.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>Don't touch me!
    <br>Who brought me here?
    <br>I destroyed everything in her marriage and new relationship.
    <br>Every man that comes cannot marry her.
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>I am the dragon!
    <br>Dragon!
    <br>She would sleep and I would make her wake up to go and look for a cigarette.
    <br>I introduced it to her through her ex-husband.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>From baby they dedicated her to me.
    <br>Do you know how beautiful a dragon is?
    <br>Ancient dragon!
    <br>Wings – greatest wings, I gave her.
    <br>She cannot do anything.
    <br>No man will stay with her.
    <br>Hatred!
    <br>I caused destruction in her life.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>This is the problem you people are facing today.
    <br>Look at the case of this woman.
    <br>You want to pray and you pray for this woman without casting the demon in her -
    <br>the challenges she has will come back to you.
    <br>Stand up, you are free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>No pain in my body at all.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am free!
    <br>My life is free!
    <br>My family is free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Oh, my God!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can move!
    <br>I can kneel down!
    <br>Father, I thank You!
    <br>I glorify Your name!
    <br>Jesus has won the battle and she is free.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ellah Mwamba.
    <br>I'm from Zambia but I live in the UK.
    <br>My testimony goes like this.
    <br>I came from the UK unable to walk.
    <br>I had a disc protrusion since 2006.
    <br>Since then they had been offering me a surgery - I was refusing.
    <br>As you can see in my hand -
    <br>it may look little, but it is very strong.
    <br>I have been on this medication since 2006 till now.
    <br>This one is Dihydrocodeine 30 mg - I take 2 of them 4 times a day; it is very strong.
    <br>It just suppresses the pain.
    <br>This one is Pregabalin 100 mg - when I take it, I become very drowsy and sleepy.
    <br>This has affected me severely at work.
    <br>I'm a nurse by profession and I work in theatres; there you are on your feet all the time.
    <br>I was a pain to my work colleagues; I could not go to work because I was always calling in sick.
    <br>I could not sit at home because I became very frustrated, angry, lonely - I had to go to work.
    <br>For few years now I had been searching for a solution with doctors.
    <br>The solution was for me to have a surgery.
    <br>I said, "No, I cannot have a surgery; there must be something else".
    <br>They said, "Well, Ms Mwamba, you just have to stay on the medication."
    <br>Before my deliverance, I was addicted.
    <br>This is an opioid, medication - I was addicted to it.
    <br>If I didn't take it, I would become agitated.
    <br>It is cocaine; you become itchy like a "druggy".
    <br>My feet, my back - to go down...
    <br>Even to tie my slippers, I had to sit down.
    <br>I had to sit down to cream my body.
    <br>It had been going for a long time.
    <br>I am a mother to two strong boys that are growing.
    <br>They are Nigerians, they like their Nigerian dishes.
    <br>"Mummy, are you coming? I want to eat my food, my stew."
    <br>I said, "I just came from work, I'm tired".
    <br>"Mummy, we need you, you are the best cook."
    <br>I had to stand - they are my children, I have to cook for them.
    <br>Coming from work, I would stand, prepare a lot of food in the night and leave it for them.
    <br>It affected my life.
    <br>When I sat on the bus and the pain came, I would take this in my hand;
    <br>people would look at me - I would feel embarrassed.
    <br>I had to take it to be sustainable - to walk from here to there.
    <br>I had to find somewhere to sit down before moving on.
    <br>To God be the glory, the God of T.B Joshua...
    <br>I don't even know what to say.
    <br>He is...
    <br>Miss Ellah Mwamba & Friend
    <br>Healing/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>How we got here - it is by the grace of God.
    <br>As you watched the clip, you saw that my affliction had to do with demonic attack;
    <br>the spiritual husband was one of the reasons I came for.
    <br>This has affected me tremendously.
    <br>I was happily married for many years.
    <br>Then, all of a sudden, he took over and the marriage was destroyed beyond recognition.
    <br>Second relationship - as you saw the man of God prophesying about two relationships.
    <br>I was engaged; I just walked away.
    <br>Obviously, the demon didn't want me to settle down.
    <br>I have been aware of my affliction - the spiritual husband and the dragon.
    <br>I have been to so many churches, both big and small, 5 people or thousands.
    <br>I have had encounters with men of God one on one;
    <br>the demon would be speaking to me, "Look at him. Is it the one who is... Let's go..."
    <br>He would be telling me, for real.
    <br>It would manifest; after I had fallen and got up, the demon would still be there,
    <br>"Do you know that I am still here? I am not going".
    <br>I would start crying.
    <br>I would go to another one, "Go to that church. There is a great man of God".
    <br>At one point, in 2012, I had an encounter where a man of God imparted on me and I freaked out.
    <br>Very severe spirit of anger.
    <br>Two bouncers grabbed me on my sides;
    <br>I pulled them down to the ground.
    <br>You saw the ancient, strong dragon manifesting - me, I was out of the body.
    <br>I don't know how to explain it.
    <br>When I came round, I was all bruised.
    <br>My friend asked, "Do you know what you did?"
    <br>I said, "I don't know. What did I do?"
    <br>"These two hefty men, you pulled them down."
    <br>I said, "Me? No!"
    <br>She said, Yes, you pulled them down.
    <br>You were so angry; that you are the dragon, this and that".
    <br>I said, "Ok".
    <br>I started to understand myself.
    <br>Everywhere I went, I was seeking for a solution.
    <br>Anger, hatred, poverty - I'm a nurse and I am struggling for money.
    <br>When the man of God said, "Look, what a beautiful woman" -
    <br>not because of shame; I felt I needed to protect myself.
    <br>I didn't want people to feel sorry for me.
    <br>I don't know if I'm making any sense.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>It affected me so much.
    <br>I was in many churches; only last Sunday, the demon was subdued.
    <br>This is my reminder.
    <br>It is shameful, but I am glad and grateful to God that I have been delivered.
    <br>I couldn't do without this thing you see.
    <br>Even in my sleep, I would dream of smoking.
    <br>At 2, 3 or 5 am I would jump out of bed, put on my pyjamas and gown,
    <br>walk across the road to buy cigarettes,
    <br>smoke 1 or 2 cigarettes to feel better and then go back to sleep.
    <br>This is very expensive.
    <br>I could finish this pack, if I was ready to smoke; I would sit down there and smoke the whole pack.
    <br>Something would just tell me to smoke.
    <br>I wouldn't release the smoke through the nose, I don't know how to do it.
    <br>I would just puff it and then throw it; take another one, puff it and throw it.
    <br>While smoking I would be thinking, plotting;
    <br>something was telling me, "You can do this or that" - no anything good.
    <br>It physically destroys your body; it is a cancerous, toxic smoke in your body.
    <br>I didn't see it that way.
    <br>It caused me to start having palpitations.
    <br>I would wake up with chest pains.
    <br>This really affected me so badly.
    <br>I started smoking at the same time I started having pains - in 2012.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>I was seeking for a solution when I wanted to do something; I knew my problem.
    <br>I had discovered that I had a spiritual husband.
    <br>I would go to a certain church, where there was a man of God.
    <br>I would sit down in the congregation and when I saw the man of God,
    <br>somehow my body would shift and the spirit would be communicating.
    <br>When the man of God got closer, they would be communicating.
    <br>The man of God would literally be staring at me not saying anything,
    <br>and the demon would tell him, "You cannot deliver me. I am here to stay. I will disgrace you",
    <br>and the man of God would just pass me and go.
    <br>What happened the moment the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, approached you?
    <br>My case is different; everyone's case is different.
    <br>I had been encouraged by watching the clips where others were delivered from spiritual husbands.
    <br>What I was expecting was not what happened that day.
    <br>The man of God was coming to that corner; he kept on facing me.
    <br>He and I had an encounter; nobody knew.
    <br>If you watch the clip, he kept on doing that and he was walking towards my direction.
    <br>At that time, before anyone realised, I was subdued and weak.
    <br>Before even speaking to me - there was no communication between me and him;
    <br>he did not allow it to speak to him.
    <br>He walked away and said, "Are you free? Take more of me, give me more of you".
    <br>He stood there and he was looking at me while he was preaching.
    <br>I connected with him and my spirit being was gone, weak, and I took over.
    <br>I started feeling something emotional.
    <br>When he approached me to prophesy to me, I started crying.
    <br>Some people say they experience "electric shock"; I just broke down.
    <br>I was just crying inside and outside.
    <br>It was an emotional deliverance.
    <br>From the time he was preaching - as he was walking, he went towards my corner.
    <br>You know like when he is saying, "Be gone!" -
    <br>I knew he was speaking to me because the demon was subdued.
    <br>Since then, I don't hear any voice anymore to tell me anything.
    <br>Miss Ellah Mwamba & Friend
    <br>Healing/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I feel free, empty and I was hungry after.
    <br>The moment the man of God came to where you were - tell us what happened.
    <br>As he was speaking, he saw in me my brokenness, sickness, affliction of anger;
    <br>what the demon did to me in my whole life.
    <br>I'm a nice person, but when I get angry, I am not a nice person to be around;
    <br>and I must make sure that I have the last say - that is what I used to do and it is not nice.
    <br>It affected me at work - my name at work is "Ellah Diva" because I must make a point.
    <br>It is not nice to be known like that.
    <br>We know you have a lot to say, based on your past experiences
    <br>but to God be the glory, it is a thing of the past.
    <br>Could you just tell us exactly the prophecies the man of God gave you - how can you confirm them to be true?
    <br>As he was approaching me, my deliverance was taking place.
    <br>He prophesied about four things.
    <br>My relationship...
    <br>Because of this situation, this anger, you keep it in there - that is why you are sick.
    <br>I started breaking down.
    <br>My heart started breaking down and I was crying.
    <br>He mentioned the second disappointment.
    <br>This is true because I divorced the first one.
    <br>"This is a second disappointment" - yes, it is true because I broke off the engagement.
    <br>He didn't break it off; I broke it off.
    <br>He cannot understand it; only I can understand it.
    <br>I confirm that to be true.
    <br>Then, he went on to prophesy that I sent an internet form.
    <br>I thought it was a man of God, but it wasn't.
    <br>If I had filled in the form, I would have been into a cult.
    <br>I confirm it to be true.
    <br>A week before I came, at my work place, I met somebody sitting and waiting for a family member.
    <br>He was sitting down with a Bible, which is rare in the hospitals in England.
    <br>He was talking with his children about the Bible.
    <br>I became intrigued and said, "What are you doing?"
    <br>He said, "We do Bible study online.
    <br>If you are interested, I will take your number and then send you an application form.
    <br>You then fill it in, and I will be sending you Bible quotes for your Bible study."
    <br>I can confirm it to be true - that's the only thing I can remember
    <br>that I would have done with that prophecy; it is 100% true.
    <br>The fourth prophecy was about the debt; I am in a big debt - 200% true.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Amen. Thank you very much.
    <br>Let's come straight to your experience - the moment the man of God touched you, what happened?
    <br>As he was approaching me, I was just weak.
    <br>At the first touch, I felt the strong energy of anointing that subdued the demon that was within me.
    <br>From then on, I couldn't remember anything.
    <br>I woke up crying - that's all I can remember.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Immediately I felt the back pain going off.
    <br>I felt that my back was so light.
    <br>I didn't feel the heaviness.
    <br>I went straight down to my knees; the thing I could not do before.
    <br>I just felt free to stretch my legs.
    <br>I have been running in my room without realising it.
    <br>I run up stairs - three hefty stairs.
    <br>I would run up the stairs and then ask one of the coordinators, "Did I just do that?"
    <br>She said, "Yes, you just did that".
    <br>I could not do that before.
    <br>I am free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>To confirm what you are talking about; could you just demonstrate some of the things you couldn't do
    <br>because of that terrible sickness that was caused by the demonic dragon, that was possessing you then?
    <br>I had to hold somebody before I knelt down, but now I can freely do it.
    <br>Before I would not even dare to go on my knees and get up again; now I get up by myself.
    <br>I would be sitting on the chair for hours.
    <br>Now, I am not feeling heaviness on my back.
    <br>I just feel free; my feet are just light.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Since my deliverance I haven't heard any voice telling me, "I'm here".
    <br>It's like I'm missing something I heard in the past.
    <br>It was like there was somebody always walking behind me.
    <br>I feel "empty" and free.
    <br>The craving for cigarettes - I'm not feeling it.
    <br>What do you want to do with these now, after your deliverance?
    <br>I am going to get rid of it.
    <br>I'm free from medication; I'm not addicted to any medication or cigarettes, in Jesus' name.
    <br>If you encounter Emmanuel TV, don't ever ask anybody for an opinion.
    <br>When you encounter Emmanuel TV, follow what God is telling you, and find your way here.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Miss Ellah Mwamba & Friend
    <br>Healing/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>God is really with us, indeed.
    <br>The way I found her is through God's grace.
    <br>My name is Asanga.
    <br>I'm a Nigerian but I live in the UK.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>I used to be a nurse, but I am retired now.
    <br>When I met her, I told her that the only way out is Jesus.
    <br>She was a Christian then.
    <br>Emmanuel TV - I found it by myself, nobody introduced me to The SCOAN.
    <br>I wanted to come here, but what I heard scared me.
    <br>One day, I saw a magazine that was writing about T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I picked it up and read it for three days.
    <br>Then I became convinced within my heart that this is a prophet of our generation.
    <br>If you check...
    <br>Miss Ellah Mwamba & Friend
    <br>Healing/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>If you check your Bible, you will find out that in every generation there is a prophet.
    <br>I give God the glory that I'm part of it now.
    <br>I have been a part of it for a long time, but in secret.
    <br>I thank God so much - the way He brought us here was a miracle.
    <br>When we came here, there was a problem already at the airport.
    <br>She fell down; we were at the airport till 1am, so we couldn't come here straight.
    <br>The following morning we came here.
    <br>We were received as if we were princesses,
    <br>as if we were invited, despite what we were told before.
    <br>They told us all sorts of things, that they would insult us but we were received.
    <br>Then on Sunday, it happened; the deliverance came.
    <br>I have been watching her since her deliverance.
    <br>Normally, we used to lock her off for migraine - no more migraine for almost 2 weeks now.
    <br>Time of her period - that's another one.
    <br>It happened here - nobody knew about it, except me and her.
    <br>I have seen a lot of changes in her; so that gives me joy.
    <br>The advice I have for the whole world and the people looking at me here:
    <br>Please, don't let any church deceive you.
    <br>When she was delivered here, the church she was attending sent a message immediately,
    <br>asking her to leave that place she is staying and go somewhere for deliverance.
    <br>We were still in the church.
    <br>I said that we are all children of God.
    <br>They are supposed to be happy for her being delivered.
    <br>They said she should go to one city, I don't know where it is - in Lagos here.
    <br>My advice to the world:
    <br>Some of you are sick, you say you don't want to be shown on TV, you are dying -
    <br>come here - it is a freedom place, a place of liberty.
