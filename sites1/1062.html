  <p>    
    <br>Under the unction and instruction of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers to people within The SCOAN auditorium.
    <br>Among them is this man who instantly reacts as the power of God flows through his body.
    <br>Every unclean spirit that operated in his life is now bowing and submitting
    <br>to the superior authority in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's watch what happens next.
    <br>You are addicted to drugs.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It's an addiction.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You took the drugs and you carried the drugs.
    <br>This is an addiction. If care is not taken, you will live the rest of your life in prison.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer
    <br>And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>He's free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>He is free indeed from the spirit of addiction. Glory be to God!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Geronimo, and I come from a small country in Europe.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>It happened when the man of God touched me and prophesied that I was into hard drugs
    <br>and it was one hundred percent true.
    <br>From that moment, the bad spirit left me
    <br>and the urge for drugs and to be back in the criminal life, went away.
    <br>It all started when I was the age of 15 or 16; I started selling marijuana.
    <br>At the age of 17 or 18, I started selling cocaine.
    <br>After that, I started selling guns and carrying guns myself.
    <br>That was when I became a part of organised crime.
    <br>I was especially trafficking cocaine in different parts of Europe.
    <br>So, our brother is explaining how from a very young age, he got involved in these criminal activities.
    <br>Apart from trafficking these drugs, you were also taking these drugs yourself.
    <br>Yes, I was also sometimes taking the drugs myself
    <br>and that led me to a lifestyle where all the money I got, only went for bad things.
    <br>So, you said, every money you received through this, you would use it for bad things.
    <br>Could you give us an example of how you were living your life at this period?
    <br>All the money was spent on prostitutes, parties, expensive cars, holidays, and not good things.
    <br>I paid to have tattoos made.
    <br>So, our brother is explaining that everything - the finances he made
    <br>from these illicit activities - he ended up using them for very bad things
    <br>such as visiting prostitutes, clubbing and other such things -
    <br>even tattooing various tattoos across his body.
    <br>So, as you were engaging in this - tell us, brother, more about your story,
    <br>how the spirit pushed you to these criminal activities.
    <br>Yes, it pushed me really hard.
    <br>I was especially focused on trafficking cocaine.
    <br>Mostly, I went to countries with a harbour; that is where we would get it.
    <br>We trafficked it with a strong magnet under cars on the motorblock.
    <br>If the police caught us, someone would hide it there.
    <br>It was mostly one-day trips back to my country - one day there, one night sleeping, one day back,
    <br>then distributing the drugs.
    <br>That lifestyle took me to Thailand to prison.
    <br>So, our brother is saying that it even got to the extent that he went to prison in Thailand.
    <br>How did you now come to a point where you realised you needed to stop such activities?
    <br>That was at the age of 25 or 26.
    <br>I began to realise that I could not go further with that because nothing good came from that life.
    <br>I started to slow down but still, there was something that pushed me every time.
    <br>When I wanted to slow down or quit everything, I couldn't help myself.
    <br>Finally, the only solution was Jesus Christ.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, our brother is explaining how he realised he needed to stop this lifestyle
    <br>but there was a force pushing him and he could not stop on his own.
    <br>So, brother, could you just tell us - at this point, you were taking these drugs as well -
    <br>as you were engaging in the trafficking, you were also taking the drugs.
    <br>How did that addiction to the drugs affect your own health and life?
    <br>It affected my health; I was not able to train which I did before.
    <br>I started taking some drugs daily.
    <br>You have said that it reached a point where you were taking some of these drugs on a daily basis.
    <br>Now, how did you discover this church in the midst of this?
    <br>How did you find out about The SCOAN?
    <br>When I started wanting to slow down, I started watching YouTube.
    <br>One day when I was watching YouTube, Emmanuel TV popped up on the first page.
    <br>There was a video about a drug trafficker from Libya.
    <br>It touched my heart and I became nearly addicted to watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So, you were not looking for that video? As you were on YouTube, the video just popped up
    <br>and you saw a video of a testimony of someone who was also a drug trafficker
    <br>who was delivered here in The SCOAN and that really touched you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And, brother, to the glory of God, you finally came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Just tell us what happened when you came.
    <br>After watching Emmanuel TV for three years, finally, I came here.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN and wanted to take my drugs out, they had disappeared.
    <br>Brother, since you arrived in the church and received that word of prophecy and deliverance,
    <br>just tell us the changes in your life.
    <br>The urge and the push is finally gone.
    <br>Everything that pushed me before to do criminal things or take drugs is finally gone.
    <br>I have no urge for smoking or drinking.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Wow! We give all the glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Brother, we believe you are really in a position to advise people.
    <br>Especially those who are still taking drugs, are involved in such activities as trafficking drugs.
    <br>As you are here right now, what is your word of advice?
    <br>My word of advice: Nothing good comes out from drugs.
    <br>I can only advise never to go into that life because you will just lose everything you have.
    <br>There comes nothing good from it.
    <br>So, you are advising people that if they are into such a lifestyle or taking such things -
    <br>what should they do to receive solution and freedom?
    <br>The only way I got my problem solved was at The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria, through Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I think what our brother is really emphasizing is that he had tried on his own to stop
    <br>but there was a force beyond his control that was really pushing him into that life,
    <br>once he got involved at such a young age.
    <br>But today, he is delivered through the prayer and prophecy of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And he is advising people that if anyone is having a similar issue,
    <br>they need to seek deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>to be separated from the evil spirit behind such an addiction or such activities.
    <br>Today, he is a living testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>Brother, we thank God for your life. We pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance
    <br>by making the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and we believe the best is yet to come in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Hello. My name is Geronimo, and I come from a small country in Europe.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN two weeks ago.
    <br>The man of God touched me and for the first time, prophesied to me, on Sunday
    <br>and he was very right in his prophecy that I was into hard drugs and had a criminal past.
    <br>After that, he prayed for me and delivered me and I feel good.
    <br>From 15 to 29, I lived a criminal life, with ups and downs.
    <br>You can never get anything good out of a criminal life.
    <br>I was into drug trafficking an dmore.
    <br>I operated in different parts of Europe and was involved in organised crime.
    <br>I was sitting at home and one day, as I was watching YouTube,
    <br>Emmanuel TV popped up on the first page and I started to watch it.
    <br>Since that day, I have been watching it nearly every day.
    <br>After three years of watching Emmanuel TV, I finally arrived here.
    <br>Ok. So, since after your deliverance last Sunday, can you please share with us -
    <br>what are the changes and the transformation that has taken place in your life?
    <br>Everything has changed - no more pain, no more urge for bad things,
    <br>no urge for drugs, smoking, criminal things. Everything has gone.
    <br>Now, I can focus on God's will, the good side of life and forget about the past.
    <br>I am totally delivered, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>Now, we can see you making preparations - you are going back to your country, right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What message are you taking back to your country?
    <br>I can say to everyone - if you have the same problem I had which I came here with,
    <br>involve God who is really at work here. I have never been in a place like this before.
    <br>This was my first time and I can say that God is really at work here.
    <br>So now that you are going back to your country,
    <br>the man of God wants to make a meaningful contribution to your life,
    <br>apart from the deliverance you have received through the grace of God
    <br>in the life of the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The man of God has also decided, with the support of the Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>to bless you with the cash sum of 2,000 USD.
    <br>This is the money, for you to be able to reestablish yourself
    <br>in going into a new business and forgetting about your past
    <br>and having no reason to go back to your past anymore
    <br>and 'The Mirror' book from the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God, for everything you have done for me
    <br>and to the Emmanuel TV Team and Partners, thank you very much for everything.
    <br>For this 2,000 USD and 'The Mirror' book, I can go back to my country and start a new life
    <br>and make everything well.
    <br>I am very grateful for everything.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you very much. On behalf of the anointed man of God and the Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>thank you also for accepting this cash gift and we know this is also going to transform your life
    <br>and with this money, you will start a new business.
    <br>We believe that very soon, you are coming back here to give glory to God Almighty
    <br>for the great transformation that will begin to take place in your life
    <br>after this deliverance you have received, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
