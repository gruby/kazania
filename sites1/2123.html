  <p>    
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Begin to ask God to give you the grace to cast aside whatever could hinder you from coming to Jesus. Prayer.
    <br>AVOID THE TRAP OF LOOKING BACK!!!
    <br>Mass Prayer With TB Joshua
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>In Isaiah 43:19 it says, "See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?".
    <br>If God is doing a new thing, it means God never consults your past to determine your future.
    <br>Where you are coming from is unnecessary.
    <br>So now, ask God to give you the grace to avoid the trap of looking back. Prayer.
