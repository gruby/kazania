  <p>    
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Edafe Unoho from Delta.
    <br>The woman beside me is my younger sister,
    <br>Ufumaulo from Delta State but currently I reside in Lagos.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>For the past 17 years, I smoked a lot.
    <br>When I smoked, I smoked all kinds of cigarettes.
    <br>I smoked and smoked and sometimes, I would cough blood because of smoking.
    <br>Apart from smoking, I drank alcohol; every kind of alcohol you can think of.
    <br>Sometimes when I drank, I would sleep on the road
    <br>and they would steal my phone and my wallet.
    <br>When I woke up, I would start looking for my belongings but I could not see them.
    <br>I was working but I would not know where my money would go.
    <br>I could not give account of myself, I could not buy clothes for myself.
    <br>I could not even take care of my wife and my children - everything was bad.
    <br>After I drank alcohol, a spirit would enter me and say,
    <br>"Now you have drunk alcohol; go and meet a girl and sleep with her".
    <br>Then, I would go and look for a prostitute to sleep with;
    <br>I can't count how many prostitutes I have slept with, after drinking alcohol.
    <br>Even at my work place - I work on a rig - the company knows I used to take alcohol
    <br>because they would have to knock on my door to wake me
    <br>before I could go out to the rig.
    <br>They would complain about me all the time. I would beg God to help me leave that kind of life.
    <br>Immediately money touched my hand, you would not see me again.
    <br>I would just disappear until I finished my salary. Then, I would come back home, regretting.
    <br>My wife would cry and ask me, "When will you stop this?"
    <br>I would say, "I don't know; I don't know what comes over me".
    <br>Immediately I had money, something would just come and say,
    <br>"What are you doing? You are a big boy. Look at your money - move!"
    <br>I would just go out and start spending the money.
    <br>If I saw someone passing, I would call them and ask what they wanted to drink.
    <br>When the money finished, my eyes would see clearly.
    <br>I would even have to beg for transport money to get home!
    <br>Sometimes I would buy drinks from a bar and my money would finish.
    <br>I would go to the ATM but there would be no money.
    <br>They would follow me to my house; I would take my property and sell it to pay off the bar.
    <br>Every day, I would go to different churches to seek for solution and deliverance but there was no result.
    <br>When I was in the beer parlour drinking, I would hear about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>People told me, "That man is using juju; why do you want to go there?
    <br>It will add more to your problem; that man is a juju man, don't go there".
    <br>So, I was afraid to come.
    <br>So who were the people saying this? Your fellow drunkards?
    <br>It was the drunkards.
    <br>Then, after I finished drinking, I would fight.
    <br>Maybe you would just be walking and I would start fighting you.
    <br>The evil spirit that pushed me to drink that alcohol would push me to fight people.
    <br>One time I fell in the gutter and lost my teeth.
    <br>I even have a scar on my body.
    <br>I just liked fighting; even if you didn't do anything to me. I could slap you and start fighting you.
    <br>I didn't know my problem. People would also stab me with bottles.
    <br>So for how long were you in this alcoholic bondage?
    <br>Seventeen years.
    <br>Ok, tell us, eventually how did you now found yourself here at the Synagogue Church?
    <br>One fateful day I was at home, about five months ago.
    <br>Around two o'clock, a spirit just said, "Get up, what are you doing?"
    <br>I just got up that night and went out to go and drink.
    <br>The spirit would come and tell me to take another bottle and go with a woman.
    <br>So, I just took one bottle to the hotel and lodged there.
    <br>That was the place where bad boys used to go - people that used to steal and kill.
    <br>They used to come to that place to drink.
    <br>I went there.
    <br>As I was inside the room, the police broke down the door and came in.
    <br>They asked, "Who are you?"
    <br>I said, "Sir, I just came to relax".
    <br>He said, "Where are you from - from that hotel? Come with us to the police station!"
    <br>They handcuffed me and the prostitute ran away.
    <br>They put me naked inside their bus.
    <br>I asked them for my clothes; they threw  just my underwear at me, so I wore it.
    <br>Some of the police said they should let me go, that I'm not that kind of person.
    <br>Some of the police said that I should suffer for what I had done.
    <br>I then showed them pictures of my wife and children.
    <br>They said, "You have these beautiful children and lovely wife
    <br>but you still come to the hotel to sleep with prostitutes?"
    <br>I said I didn't know what came over me.
    <br>They said for that, they would punish me and I would go to court.
    <br>I cried out, "Oh my God, is this how I will leave my wife and children?"
    <br>I called my wife and told her that they had arrested me.
    <br>She asked me where and I told her it was were I used to drink.
    <br>She said, "Thank God they arrested you!"
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>She said, "I will not come; you will die there".
    <br>I was in the cell for three or four days without any food; I was hungry.
    <br>When the officers came, I would beg them.
    <br>They would say, "You suffer the punishment".
    <br>God wanted to use that problem to bring me out of the mess.
    <br>I kneeled down inside the cell and said,
    <br>"God, wherever You are, I know I have sinned against You,
    <br>I will not sin again in this life; just deliver me from this problem.
    <br>I will serve You for the rest of my life till I die; I will not sin again".
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So because you saw the worst disgrace of your life.
    <br>I was disgraced and with criminals. I was sleeping with criminals.
    <br>They even gave me a plastic bag as a bed and said, "Chairman, sleep".
    <br>There was no food to eat.
    <br>So how did you get out of the cell?
    <br>All of a sudden someone who knew me saw me.
    <br>As I prayed to God, God really answered my prayer
    <br>because He really wanted me to come out of the bondage.
    <br>Somebody saw me when I was at the counter to collect money from the wallet
    <br>to give them to buy water for me.
    <br>He said, "Brother, I have been looking for you! I heard that the police arrested you".
    <br>I said yes and he said that he wanted to bail me out.
    <br>I said, "You want to bail me? Glory be to God; God has answered my prayers!"
    <br>As I prayed, they bailed me out of prison and I went home.
    <br>I called my sister and she told me that The SCOAN was close to where I stayed.
    <br>After you told her your problems.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And what you went through.
    <br>She said it was close and we could go together.
    <br>I said, "But they say that man is a ritualist. What do you want me to do there?"
    <br>She said no, that she had gone there to receive the Morning Water.
    <br>She said she had been having a spiritual husband but now, there is nothing like that.
    <br>There is breakthrough and things are moving well with her family.
    <br>She asked if I had cable and I said yes.
    <br>She said I should tune to the channel, so I tuned to the channel.
    <br>I started watching and realised the man of God is a true man of God.
    <br>It's not the way they think.
    <br>He is a true man of God -
    <br>a man of God that God called to help, to deliver, to heal all over the nations -
    <br>he is a true man of God.
    <br>If we had two T.B. Joshua's in Nigeria, nobody would suffer in this world.
    <br>I started watching; I started building my faith.
    <br>I said, "This is not enough; let me go there."
    <br>I came and had the opportunity to receive the Morning Water.
    <br>I went home and started ministering the Morning Water and praying with the Morning Water.
    <br>I discovered that I no longer had the urge to smoke and drink.
    <br>When I smelled the odour, it was just like a bomb.
    <br>It was like somebody wanted to bomb me and I would start running from the odour of the smoke.
    <br>Even with alcohol, once I smelled the odour and it was just like poison.
    <br>I said, "This guy wants to poison me; let me not give him a chance."
    <br>I told the man to move away from me.
    <br>He said, "I know you; you are a drunkard. What are you talking about?"
    <br>I said, "This thing smells; I don't like the odour. It is disturbing me."
    <br>I give thanks to God!
    <br>There was a day I slept and saw the man of God praying for people in the dream.
    <br>The crowd was much. I decided to meet the man of God to pray for me.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>But when I saw the crowd, I asked myself how I could walk through the crowd,
    <br>that maybe the man of God would listen to my wife.
    <br>In the dream, I told my wife,
    <br>"Please, take the children and go cry out to the man of God to deliver me."
    <br>So, my wife took the children in my dream and cried, "Man of God, please help my husband!"
    <br>The man of God asked who the woman was that was crying for the husband to be delivered.
    <br>He said, "Madam, come."
    <br>The man of God called her, so she went to him and he asked her what her problem was.
    <br>She told her that her husband used to drink and disgrace himself,
    <br>that he would fall into the gutter, lose many things and could not take care of his family.
    <br>In the dream.
    <br>She continued, "Every day I used to cry.
    <br>The children are not going to school because he cannot save money.
    <br>When he collects his salary, he wastes the money."
    <br>The man of God just laughed and said, "Where is your husband?"
    <br>I got up from where I sat and walked up close to the man of God.
    <br>He said, "This man? He is already delivered! He doesn't need to be delivered again."
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>"Just say, 'Thank You, Jesus!' Your husband is already delivered."
    <br>I then woke up from the dream and said, "Thank you Jesus, I am delivered."
    <br>I was so happy. Now, I don't even think about alcohol, smoking, drinking or womanising.
    <br>I am just free!
    <br>Before, I used to smoke Indian hemp.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So when you perceive the odour of cigarettes or Indian hemp now, how does it make you feel?
    <br>It's just like a bomb - it's as if somebody wants to bomb me; so I would just run away.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>I thank God and thank the man of God
    <br>for delivering me from that bondage of smoking, drinking and womanising.
    <br>I give all the glory to God.
    <br>After the man of God delivered me in the dream, things started changing; favour started coming.
    <br>I, who never even had an account, started saving money.
    <br>I rented a shop for my wife and even bought a car for myself.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Just what we said earlier, that deliverance carries along so many things.
    <br>Apart from being set free from that demonic influence and torment,
    <br>all other things attached like poverty, setback, failure, disappointment -
    <br>everything will be gone by the time you are delivered.
    <br>So you can see after his deliverance, the breakthrough he never experienced.
    <br>A man that did not even have a bank account because that demon behind the smoking and drinking addiction
    <br>would not allow him to save any money to do anything good for himself and his family.
    <br>After his deliverance, he could save, he could have an account and now he could purchase a vehicle,
    <br>as you can see on the screen.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>What else has God done for you?
    <br>This deliverance was not for me alone. For three or four years my mum was sick.
    <br>She could not walk. I would send money to her to take care of herself and for medication.
    <br>I decided that as I was delivered through the Morning Water,
    <br>I should use the Morning Water to reach other people who need deliverance.
    <br>I got the Morning Water and travelled to Delta.
    <br>But before I went, I prayed:
    <br>"The God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, you delivered me; use me to deliver others, for my testimony."
    <br>I travelled.
    <br>As I reached Sapele in Delta, I greeted my mother who said, "My child, I cannot walk!
    <br>Thank you for the money you sent for my drugs."
    <br>I told her that she would not take those drugs anymore -
    <br>the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua would deliver her that day.
    <br>I asked her if she believed in God. She said that she went to church.
    <br>I said that it is not about going to church, 'Do you believe in God?"
    <br>I told her that some people go to church but they don't believe in God.
    <br>They don't have faith in God; they just go to church to warm the bench.
    <br>Later, they go back home.
    <br>Day by day and year by year, there are no changes because they don't have faith in God.
    <br>The ex-drunkard and smoker becomes an evangelist.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>I told my mother to repeat after me a prayer.
    <br>"Father, forgive me; I will not sin again. Father, deliver me.
    <br>If You deliver me, I will serve You for the rest of my life."
    <br>She repeated after me.
    <br>I then raised up the Morning Water and prayed
    <br>to the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver my mother in her bedroom.
    <br>I called on the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua to come upon me.
    <br>Immediately, something came upon me and then I felt bold.
    <br>I declared, "In the name of Jesus, I command you sickness, come out, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>So you were spraying the Morning Water?
    <br>I ministered the Morning Water and commanded that it was the last day of the sickness.
    <br>Something ministered to my heart that it was not sickness but an attack.
    <br>I said, "This is your last day in this body; the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua will deliver you
    <br>through this medium of the Morning Water."
    <br>I said, "Be delivered, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!"
    <br>I said, "Mama, be delivered right now!
    <br>You demon, contrary spirit, be loosed, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!"
    <br>So what now happened?
    <br>My mother started shaking.
    <br>She said, "My children, hold me; I want to fall!" She then fell backwards on the ground.
    <br>I said, "Mama, get up; you are free! The God of Prophet T.B. Joshua has delivered you."
    <br>My mother stood up and started moving around.
    <br>My mother said, "I could not do this before. I could not dance; I could not jump."
    <br>She then went outside and started walking.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So do you have a picture or anything to show when mama was delivered?
    <br>This is my mother when she was delivered.
    <br>I can eat now!
    <br>I can dance now!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank You, Father. I can dance and walk now.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>The Morning Water that I used to minister on mum, touched my younger sister.
    <br>So she was just...
    <br>She was running away; I ran towards her and held her.
    <br>I asked, "Where are you going? Who are you in this body?
    <br>Speak out! What have you done to her?
    <br>In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus, I command you to speak out.
    <br>Holy Ghost fire all over your body, from your head to your toes!"
    <br>So what was the demon now saying?
    <br>The demon shouted, "Fire! I'm a princess, an ancient princess.
    <br>I control four seas."
    <br>"What have you done to her life?"
    <br>"I destroyed her life."
    <br>"What have you done to her career?"
    <br>"I destroyed her career, I destroyed."
    <br>So eventually what now happened? Was she finally delivered?
    <br>She was finally delivered.
    <br>The Morning Water finished so I told them to add water to the Morning Water bottle.
    <br>When it finished, they would bring more.
    <br>What made you to have that belief that if you put ordinary water, it would still work?
    <br>Because I heard a man give a testimony of how he delivered his wife inside their bedroom.
    <br>He said that when the Morning Water finished, he went to his car.
    <br>Inside the little Morning Water remaining, he would look for bottled water to add to it.
    <br>That was how I knew the Morning Water was working.
    <br>They kept bringing water and I kept using it until it was finished.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, Holy Ghost fire, I command you to come out of this body!"
    <br>She started shouting and vomiting; I have the video.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Ok, I think the video will say the rest and remember just like he said, when the Morning Water got finished...
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>You remembered the testimony of someone who also encountered the same deliverance at home
    <br>and he said he filled the bottle with ordinary water.
    <br>The water became anointed because the empty bottle was still retaining the anointing.
    <br>So you had the same belief and you asked your brother to keep filling the bottle and the deliverance continued.
    <br>Hallelujah! So can we see the video?
    <br>Morning Water Deliverance
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Morning Water Deliverance
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Tell us - what are the changes in the life of your sister?
    <br>There are lots of changes.
    <br>When I came that day, because of the evil spirit, I was seeing her as an old woman
    <br>but in the morning when I saw her, she was beautiful.
    <br>I said, "Glory be to God."
    <br>The demon had been hiding the beauty of my sister.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>I asked, "How is your body? Did you sleep well?"
    <br>She said she slept like a baby and didn't know when day broke.
    <br>People even had to wake her.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So can we just hear a word or two from the sister.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ufoma.
    <br>Ok, the man beside you, who is he?
    <br>He is my brother - senior brother.
    <br>Same mother and same father?
    <br>Tell us, when this evil spirit started operating in your life.
    <br>Since childhood.
    <br>Yes, for thirty-five years now.
    <br>So tell us - what kind of family background did you come from? How did this spirit enter your life?
    <br>My mother worshipped idols.
    <br>When she wanted to give birth, she would kill a goat.
    <br>Anytime she wants to give birth to a baby...
    <br>She would kill a goat for the idol Konovo.
    <br>Mr Edafe Unoho & Sister
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>And that was how all of you were delivered?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>As you were growing up, tell us what began to happen.
    <br>As I was growing up, by the age of 12 years, I lost my virginity.
    <br>I was so stubborn. I would beat men and girls.
    <br>I could beat five women at once - even six.
    <br>The spirit of dragon started using me.
    <br>If I quarreled with someone, that night they would fall sick.
    <br>They would come and beg.
    <br>After begging me, I would tell them to go, that I had forgiven them.
    <br>I would say, "You don't know me and you're quarreling with me. You don't know I'm a dragon."
    <br>In my mind.
    <br>I have been to many churches.
    <br>And at school how did this evil spirit affect you?
    <br>I didn't go to school; it affected my schooling.
    <br>It affected your school?
    <br>All of my brothers and sisters went to school but me - this evil spirit affected my schooling.
    <br>I didn't go to school.
    <br>When I was 12 years old, I would run around and sleep outside.
    <br>I gave birth to my oldest son at the age of 16 years - outside.
    <br>So how did it affect your marriage?
    <br>It affected my marriage.
    <br>I have four children from three husbands.
    <br>This is how he would go - he would leave me because the spirit would pursue him.
    <br>Another one would go.
    <br>My last baby is 10 months old and I have left that man too.
    <br>How about your spiritual life - in your dreams, what are things you used to see?
    <br>In my dreams, I would see a huge man who would sleep with me.
    <br>In my dreams, I would see some girls calling me, "Princess."
    <br>They used to call you princess in the evil kingdom?
    <br>At the age of seventeen, I got married in the spiritual kingdom.
    <br>So tell us, that very day your brother brought the Morning Water,
    <br>prayed for your mother and she started walking, what happened to you?
    <br>When my brother was coming, I didn't see his face.
    <br>I just saw his back as he collected his bag from his car.
    <br>I just saw fire coming from his back.
    <br>I asked myself who that strong man was.
    <br>When he turned his face to me, I saw he was my brother.
    <br>I said, "Wow! This guy is carrying fire!"
    <br>I asked where he was coming from because I had never seen such since I was born.
    <br>He came to our house but I refused to open the door.
    <br>My mother told me to open the door for my brother.
    <br>When I opened the door, he asked, "Ufoma, how are you?"
    <br>I looked down and said, "I'm fine."
    <br>I dropped my head down and said, "I'm fine."
    <br>You couldn't look at your brother.
    <br>No, I couldn't look at him.
    <br>For the moment our sister is explaining her encounter before her deliverance that immediately
    <br>her elder brother standing beside her now, came with the mission to pray for the mother
    <br>who was sick and could not walk with the Morning Water,
    <br>as he was alighting from the vehicle and she saw him from the distance,
    <br>she became scared of what she saw.
    <br>She didn't know it was her brother because she saw fire all over him,
    <br>not knowing that it was the Morning Water that he was bringing out from his car
    <br>that was bringing out the spiritual fire that she began to see.
    <br>So when he turned his face, she later discovered that it was her brother.
    <br>And she said, "I have never seen my brother with this kind of fire, what is happening."
    <br>So when the brother came closer and was asking her questions - where is mamma?
    <br>She said she couldn't behold the face of the brother because of the fire that was all over him
    <br>due to the Morning Water he was carrying.
    <br>So when your brother started praying for your mother, what happened to you?
    <br>He started praying for my mother in the dining room.
    <br>Then he said, "In Jesus' name" and I said, "Amen".
    <br>When he sprayed the Morning Water, a little of it touched my body.
    <br>At that place, I felt fire.
    <br>I said, "Wow, this is a very powerful Water this boy carried here."
    <br>I wondered how I was going to escape; as he prayed, I wanted to run away.
    <br>I went to the gate - there was fire; I opened the window - there was fire.
    <br>I shouted, "Hey, where I will pass?"
    <br>I saw no place to pass but I wanted to run.
    <br>The spirit in me said, "Run, Princess! Run because I'm finished!"
    <br>One Spirit then told me, "Don't run. Today you will receive your breakthrough; don't go anywhere."
    <br>I asked, "What?" One Spirit then told me, "Don't go anywhere." I said, "Okay."
    <br>The other spirit said, "Carry the baby; they will not notice you." So I carried the baby.
    <br>They were praying next door to me; I was in the parlour.
    <br>I heard, "Amen!" so I did not go near the place they were praying.
    <br>Ok, you were far, in another room?
    <br>I was far from them.
    <br>I just heard, "Amen!" but I did not go near them.
    <br>My brother came and said, "Ufoma." I carried the baby; I wanted to go outside.
    <br>He said, "You stop there! Who are you in this body?"
    <br>He sprayed the Morning Water on my face.
    <br>He said, "I want you to leave this body, now!"
    <br>I said, "Stop! Fire!" The thing I remember was the fire.
    <br>I don't remember how I manifested or anything else.
    <br>But I just saw the fire.
    <br>It is only that which I remember.
    <br>And since after that deliverance, tell us - what are the things that began to happen in your life.

    <br>I am sleeping well.
    <br>I didn't know light was good because all those years, I have been in darkness.
    <br>Light is so good.
    <br>When I look into the mirror, I have to ask, "Is this me, Ufoma?"
    <br>In my area, they don't call me a lady because I beat everybody.
    <br>There is no one who doesn't know me in my area.
    <br>I was surprised I looked so good. I thanked God.
    <br>So how were you looking before when this demon was...
    <br>Everybody hated me.
    <br>When my brother prayed for me on the 24th, one girl said, "Ufoma, you look old."
    <br>Then on the 25th, she said, "Hey! You look fine!"
    <br>I said, "But the 24th and 25th are the same," in my mind.
    <br>I said, "I look fine? Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>A day to your deliverance, a sister saw you and said you are looking...
    <br>On the 24th, a lady said I looked old and lean.
    <br>And the next day, after the deliverance she saw you again.
    <br>She saw me again and said, "Wow! You look good. What did you do? Your complexion is so nice.
    <br>Oh! You look fine. No one will know you have four children."
    <br>I said, "My sister, it is true; it is God's work."

    <br>And now you are very happy; you are free.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>I am very happy!
    <br>Before, from morning until night, I would sit in the joint drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes.
    <br>Thus, I was living a rough life.
    <br>But now, there is nothing like that any longer.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!

    <br>So, we know you have so much to say but time is not on our side.
    <br>Madam, tell us, what advice - just short word of advice - you have for people listening to your testimony
    <br>and particularly what can you say about this Morning Water?
    <br>The Morning Water is real.
    <br>The advice to the people watching me now is to believe in God and give your life to Christ.
    <br>God will really make it for you.
    <br>Because I didn't believe that after 35 years I could become somebody today.
    <br>Before now, I used to condemn myself but now, I see that I am a beautiful lady.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!
