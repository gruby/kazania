    <br>There is a woman I touched there - you have the spirit of bedwetting.
    <br>Come out. Don't be shy; this is the problem you brought here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After the prophecy from Prophet T.B. Joshua, the woman comes forward
    <br>to declare she has the spirit of bedwetting and wants to be set free.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Elizabeth.
    <br>Man of God, I'm the woman who is bedwetting.
    <br>I have been bedwetting for 35 years-- since I was born.
    <br>Please, Man of God deliver me.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In accordance with Acts 4:30,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua stretches forth his hand to deliver the lady from the cause of her problem.
    <br>She stumbles as the operation of the Holy Spirit takes place.
    <br>As the struggling evil spirit looses its grip,
    <br>she falls to the ground and is set totally free.
    <br>Ex-bedwetter.
    <br>Now free from the spirit of bedwetting,
    <br>she rises to her feet and gives thanks to God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus I am free!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Elizabeth Gideon. This is my husband, his name is Gideon Egu.
    <br>Last Sunday, when I came here, I was sitting that side for the first time.
    <br>Man of God prophesied that there is a woman sitting there - she has a problem of bedwetting.
    <br>So when he said that, I knew I was the one.
    <br>But I was feeling shy. I didn't want to come out
    <br>because of my husband - he was at home watching Emmanuel TV and he did not know that I had that spirit.
    <br>Mrs Elizabeth Gideon & Husband 
    <br>Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So it all started when I was young. I grew up to know myself bedwetting.
    <br>When I was in school, before I married,
    <br>in my boarding school, my bunk was up so I had to sleep on the floor, so that when that thing happened,
    <br>the thing would not be dripping on the person under me.
    <br>So all my dormitory mates knew that
    <br>I always slept on the floor.
    <br>So but they did not know the reason why
    <br>because anytime it happened like that, I would quickly wake up and pack it, wash the clothes I used to sleep.
    <br>So I have been managing it like that
    <br>till I got married - I did not let my husband know.
    <br>So if we slept in the night, if that thing happened, I would have to go and carry my baby
    <br>from where he is sleeping. I would carry him and put him where I was sleeping, where that thing happened.
    <br>So when my husband woke up, he would think it is the baby that was bedwetting.
    <br>So I have been managing it like that.
    <br>So last Sunday, when I came here, that very day that I came here, I bedwetted that morning.
    <br>So when Man of God was saying that there is a lady sitting down there
    <br>that has a spirit of bedwetting - I knew I was the one.
    <br>Mrs Elizabeth Gideon & Husband 
    <br>Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So when I came out, Man of God delivered me
    <br>and I felt shock in my body, since then I have not bedwetted. I sleep well.
    <br>Mrs Elizabeth Gideon & Husband 
    <br>Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Before, I would stop drinking water when it's six o'clock,
    <br>even with that it will happen.
    <br>But since my deliverance, I have been drinking enough water and I have not bedwetted.
    <br>Uncle, as you are listening to your wife, do you begin to put 2 and 2 together of what your wife is saying?
    <br>Emmanuel (God with us - Matthew 1:23). My name is Gideon Egu.
    <br>All what my wife said, I was so surprised.
    <br>We are married over 7 years. I was so surprised last Sunday when I was watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>and I heard Man of God emphasizing that
    <br>there was a particular woman who was bedwetting, he was trying to describe that she should not be shy.
    <br>Then, I was even with my elder brother because we were planning to travel with my child.
    <br>So my elder brother was even saying, "Who is this woman, can't she come out?"
    <br>I never knew she...
    <br>Lets look, for sometime now people have been frowning. It is time now let them laugh.
    <br>I never knew it was my wife.
    <br>Later on, I saw the miracle and few hours later she called me that I should switch on my  Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I pretended as if I didn't hear her. She called me and she told that there is an interviewer,
    <br>immediately I saw how she was being delivered.
    <br>Ok, she said she normally carry baby to her spot
    <br>where she used to bedwet. Can you confirm that?
    <br>Man of God, yes. Even up to now, if she did not say that, I wouldn't believe that such a thing did happen.
    <br>I always thought it was my child that was betwetting.
    <br>Well, glory be to God - your wife is free today.
    <br>That is the power of God for you. 
    <br>Mrs Elizabeth Gideon & Husband 
    <br>Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She has been praying on her own, fasting on her own.
    <br>There is nothing she has not done on her own, even without her husband knowing.
    <br>She has used tablet to stop this bedwetting. There is nothing she has not done.
    <br>She was fasting, praying, fasting three days - no way.
    <br>So but today it's over.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Since that Sunday, I started to observe her and discovered she did not bedwet again.
    <br>And apart from bedwetting, her attitude -
    <br>sometimes, she had this spirit of anger.
    <br>Little thing - she would get annoyed. She would leave the bed and go other side.
    <br>Since that Sunday, I observed that her life and everything has changed, apart from that bedwetting.
    <br>Mr Gideon & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy & Deliverance Testimony
    <br>My advice to people who are watching me that have the  same problem that I had before
    <br>that they should not keep problems to themselves.
    <br>They should run to God for deliverance and God will help them as He has helped me in Jesus' name.
    <br>Hallelujah! You listen to that!
    <br>That's all. How many years have you been in that trouble?
    <br>For 35 years.
    <br>35 years. That is it, it's over. Glory be to God. Hallelujah! Thank you.
