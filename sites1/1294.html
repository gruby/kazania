  <p>    
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Children of God, praise the Lord!
    <br>If you are happy to be in the presence of God, put your hands together for our Lord Jesus.
    <br>If you believe today is the day that the Lord has made in your life,
    <br>put your hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Greet your neighbor, "Good morning".
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we want to greet you once again - Good morning, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Good morning to your health!
    <br>Good morning to your business!
    <br>Good morning to your career!
    <br>Good morning to your destiny!
    <br>Good morning to your life, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "It is a new dawn".
    <br>It is a new dawn.
    <br>The Bible says that if anything is in Christ, it's a new creation.
    <br>In the mind of God, the old man has stopped being; the new man has taken his place.
    <br>My name is Yinka.
    <br>Today by the grace of God, I want to tell you
    <br>that whatever unpleasant situation that you may be facing,
    <br>whatever seems impossible in your life -
    <br>get ready because the Holy Spirit will make it possible, in Jesus' name!
    <br>In the Book of Genesis 1:3, when God said, "Let there be light",
    <br>the Bible says, He trusted His Word and there was light.
    <br>He's the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
    <br>He was not speaking out of things that were already in existence
    <br>but of things that are yet unseen;
    <br>things that look naturally impossible.
    <br>His expression showed that whatever God ordered or or decreed out of faith,
    <br>came into being.
    <br>I don't know the challenges that you are facing this morning, brethren.
    <br>And I don't know the mountain that surrounds you.
    <br>But I tell you, if you can exercise that absolute faith that God had in His Word
    <br>when creating you, you can say to your mountain, "Move!"
    <br>With faith in your heart, without doubt, you will move the impossible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Trust".
    <br>Trust - move the impossible!
    <br>The Bible says that everyone is endowed with something within
    <br>that needs to be transferred to the outside.
    <br>You have been endowed with something within
    <br>that needs to be transferred to the outside.
    <br>It is easy to say, "I am a faith man" and continue to hope for years.
    <br>As long as you continue hoping, the Bible says it will always be beyond you
    <br>until you add substance to your hope and receive Christ by faith.
    <br>The Bible says that faith is the substance of things hoped for.
    <br>Faith is the substance of things we hope for.
    <br>Faith and hope, the Bible says, go together.
    <br>The problem of our faith, brethren, is not far from the fact that
    <br>we fail to add substance to our hope and receive Christ by faith.
    <br>And that is why the Book of James says that faith is to be expressed through works.
    <br>Faith without works, the Bible says, is dead.
    <br>But don't forget that it is your works that confirm that faith is alive and active in you.
    <br>It is your actions that confirm that faith is alive and active in you.
    <br>It is your deeds that confirm that faith is alive and active in you.
    <br>Therefore faith is perfected by our acting on the Word of God.
    <br>Faith can be likened to the soup you prepare in your various homes.
    <br>I know we have a lot of shelves in the house.
    <br>We have a lot of people who know how to make soup.
    <br>Those ingredients you put together to make soup
    <br>are what the Bible refers to as substance.
    <br>I quickly want to ask one or two people here.
    <br>If you can just tell us,
    <br>if you would like to make a local dish, I mean soup,
    <br>can you tell us - what are the two or three ingredients you put together to make a soup.
    <br>I believe you are going to represent all the good cooks, good chefs here.
    <br>Tell us two or three ingredients you put together.
    <br>Well, I like tomato soup so I will take onions and also chicken and maggie.
    <br>That is good.
    <br>Our sister just told us about four different ingredients
    <br>that she, on her own, will put together to make a beautiful soup.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know you can make your soup in different ways and still have wonderful results.
    <br>Now in faith, those ingredients you put together,
    <br>I mean those substances that you put together to make a right result,
    <br>in faith, the Bible refers to them as trust.
    <br>This maggie, chicken you are talking about,
    <br>the Bible refers to them as confidence, obedience, patience, perseverance, endurance.
    <br>These are the instruments of faith.
    <br>The Bible refers to them as works.
    <br>Today we want to move impossibilities in our lives
    <br>but we fail to consider those ingredients, substances that we need to activate our faith.
    <br>Our hearts desire breakthrough but we don't seem to understand
    <br>that we need to add those substances, ingredients to activate our faith.
    <br>In the Book of Genesis 15, the Bible says that Abraham understood this principle.
    <br>When God promised that he was going to father many nations at his old age,
    <br>the Bible says he trusted God that He would keep His Word.
    <br>What God valued in Abraham was the trust he had in his ability to do the impossible.
    <br>Abraham trusted God that He would do the impossible
    <br>and that was what God valued so much in him.
    <br>Tell your neighbor,  "Trust - move the impossible".
    <br>And that will be the title of our message today.
    <br>I would like to go to the Book of James 2 as our proof text.
    <br>The Book of James 2 and let's take our reading from verse 14.
    <br>Now I read.
    <br>What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works?
    <br>Can faith save him?
    <br>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,
    <br>and one of you says to them, "Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,"
    <br>but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit?
    <br>Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
    <br>But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works".
    <br>Show me your faith without your works and I will show you my faith by my works.
    <br>You believe that there is one God.
    <br>You do well.
    <br>Even the demons believe - and tremble!
    <br>But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?
    <br>Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works when he offered Isaac, his son, on the altar?
    <br>Do you see that faith was working together with his works,
    <br>and by works, faith was made perfect?
    <br>Verse 23.
    <br>And the Scripture was fulfilled which says
    <br>"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness".
    <br>And he was called the friend of God.
    <br>The last verse for this proof text.
    <br>Verse 24.
    <br>You see then that a man is justified by works and not by faith only.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "A man is justified by works".
    <br>I will be justified by my works and not by faith alone.
    <br>Trusting in God does not consist in prayer alone.
    <br>There are times that we pray in faith and there are times that we aren't in faith.
    <br>I mean there are things that we must do ourselves and others we expect from God.
    <br>There are things that we must do ourselves
    <br>and there are some things that we will expect from God.
    <br>We all have sent our petitions to God.
    <br>We all have sent our requests and our heart's desires to God.
    <br>It is high time for you to sit back in faith to hear what God has to say about your situation.
    <br>In this process, brethren, you need to add trust, patience, perseverance, obedience
    <br>as substance to your hope and activate your faith.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua says, "Prayer for any special object
    <br>must be followed by an absolute trust in the Father
    <br>that He is working out the answer".
    <br>Prayer for any special object.
    <br>Faith is not a legalistic formula created and accepted by man.
    <br>God responds to faith and not formula.
    <br>Faith is not an issue of ordering God around as many do today.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>We are ordering God around when we do not know God's will for our lives
    <br>and we continue to pray.
    <br>Remember God's will means God's promises for our lives.
    <br>That is why you see people murmuring, complaining
    <br>when the answer to their prayers seems to delay in coming.
    <br>They begin to seek for shortcuts, alternatives, beating the gun.
    <br>Brethren, you must always understand that when God is executing His plans in your life,
    <br>He also designs and arranges events which will continue to unfold
    <br>until His purpose is revealed in your life.
    <br>Now take note of this:
    <br>God promises.
    <br>I know God must have promised us a lot of things.
    <br>God promises. He Himself also designs.
    <br>He creates, He plans before fulfilling those promises in your life.
    <br>He designs events of your life as Christians.
    <br>Those events could be the unpleasant situation that you are going through.
    <br>I mean, those plans could be the challenges, persecution,
    <br>that you may be going through right now.
    <br>Brethren, if God allowed it as He did Job and a host of others,
    <br>do not think it strange and doubt your Guard.
    <br>If God allowed it, you must not consider it unusual or abnormal.
    <br>If God allowed that unpleasant situation, you must not consider it odd
    <br>and begin to question your faith.
    <br>When some do not see beyond their immediate situation -
    <br>you know as man, they want to plan themselves because they can't wait for God's time.
    <br>They want to design themselves; if possible, execute their own plan themselves
    <br>whereas they are the work of art.
    <br>The Book of Genesis 22 says that Abraham moved and did the impossible.
    <br>When God instructed him to sacrifice his only child,
    <br>Abraham knew that Isaac was a child of promise.
    <br>Abraham realized that God would not delight Himself
    <br>in breaking the covenant by killing the object of promise.
    <br>And that is why when Isaac asked his father in that verse 7,
    <br>"Father, you said we are going for sacrifice.
    <br>But this is wood and this is fire.
    <br>But, father, tell me, where is the lamb for the offering?"
    <br>Abraham said to Isaac, "My son, the Lord would provide for Himself the lamb for the offering".
    <br>The Bible says immediately, the Holy Spirit affected his word
    <br>and his word became an instrument of victory.
    <br>Obeying God at first seems hard
    <br>until we come to realize that all He asks is for our good -
    <br>He makes life full and free for us.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "It honors God to believe Him".
    <br>It honors God to believe Him even while every sense contradicts Him.
    <br>For example, we have seen someone who had been promised of being a bank manager
    <br>and finally receives a sack letter as a clerk.
    <br>Little did he know that that sack letter was to reveal the purpose of God for his life.
    <br>We have seen many gardeners who finally became managing directors of companies.
    <br>We have seen a prisoner who finally became a president of a nation.
    <br>We have indeed seen a servant yesterday who finally became a leader today.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "It honors God to believe Him even while every sense contradicts Him".
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Remember, crossing the Red Sea was an impossible task in the natural.
    <br>The Bible says the Red Sea was against the free movement
    <br>of the Israelites into the Promised Land.
    <br>The Red Sea was against their success.
    <br>The Red Sea was against their free movement but Moses looked beyond it
    <br>and moved the impossible.
    <br>I want you to begin to say right now with faith in your hearts
    <br>that whatever Red Sea stands against me and my success -
    <br>say it with all your heart because the Holy Spirit will affect your word right now
    <br>and that word will become an instrument.
    <br>Say, "Whatever Red Sea that stands against me and my success,
    <br>whatever Red Sea that stands against me and my freedom,
    <br>whatever Red Sea that stands against me and my success,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ, give way!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, begin to give way!
    <br>Say it with all your heart
    <br>because the Holy Spirit will affect you right now
    <br>and that word will  bring about your victory today, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name!
    <br>For those who want to see before they believe,
    <br>I want to tell you - remember what the Bible says in the Book of John 20:29
    <br>that blessed are those who have not yet seen but believe.
    <br>For faith based on what is seen lacks the quality of being stable.
    <br>2 Corinthians 5:7 says, "For we walk by faith, not by sight".
    <br>It is faith that sees the invisible - what the ordinary eyes cannot see.
    <br>It is faith that moves the impossible.
    <br>It is faith that receives the incredible.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "Trust and move the impossible".
    <br>Trust - move the impossible, in Jesus' name!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Remember the Jewish brothers in the Book of Daniel 3.
    <br>The Bible says a believing heart produces right behavior, good words as a proof of faith.
    <br>A believing heart produces right behavior, good words as a proof of faith.
    <br>Right words, right behavior that honour Jesus
    <br>reveal that faith is already lodged in the heart.
    <br>In Daniel 3 from verse 17 to 18,
    <br>when Nebuchadnezzar threatened  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego with fire,
    <br>the Bible says they trusted the God of the impossibilities
    <br>and that is why they were bold to say to the king,
    <br>"O King, we want you to know that if we are thrown inside this fiery furnace,
    <br>our God is able, more than able, to rescue us, to deliver us and to set us free.
    <br>But if he does not, we want you to know, o Majesty,
    <br>that we will not serve your gods or your image that you have set up".
    <br>The Bible says the Holy Spirit affected their word.
    <br>That word that they spoke rose above the law of nature
    <br>and turned the fiery furnace ice-cold because that word was spoken from the heart.
    <br>The Word of God in their hearts rose above the law of nature
    <br>and turned the fiery furnace ice-cold.
    <br>So, brethren, what is your situation?
    <br>I don't know the unpleasant circumstances that you are facing right now.
    <br>I don't know the mountain surrounding you.
    <br>I don't know the situation in your career.
    <br>Or perhaps you have received a report that says, "It is incurable".
    <br>But I want you to know one thing:
    <br>The Word of God on your lips today as believers will rise against the law of nature
    <br>and make that impossibility in your life possible, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remember, the Word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword.
    <br>When you experience situations that seem contrary to the promise of God for your life, 
    <br>always remember it is an opportunity to cultivate an attitude of Christ Jesus.
    <br>As far as we live, tests and trials will come;
    <br>when they come, it is an opportunity for you to cultivate an attitude of Christ Jesus.
    <br>Stay focused!
    <br>Be calm!
    <br>Don't take a step back!
    <br>Stay steady even when everything around you is unsteady.
    <br>Always remember that there is always light at the end of the tunnel.
    <br>The tests that come from Jesus always help our character development.
    <br>The Bible says that God oftentimes uses hard times to produce maturity and humility in us.
    <br>God oftentimes uses hard times to produce maturity, humility and completeness in us
    <br>so that we can share in His holiness
    <br>and be equipped to enjoy the peace and righteousness in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, those who are under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>the way out:
    <br>The first step of our work of faith is to stop our own work,
    <br>to stop our own plan, and rest on God's love, power and wisdom.
    <br>Tests and trials will come as long as we live.
    <br>But when they come, don't be troubled.
    <br>Be focused, be steady, even when everything around you is unsteady.
    <br>Finally, brethren, turn with me quickly to the Book of Hebrews 12
    <br>and let's quickly take our reading from verse 1 to 2.
    <br>"Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,
    <br>let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us,
    <br>and let us run with endurance, the race that is set before us."
    <br>Verse 2.
    <br>"Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him
    <br>endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Brethren, it is the right time for you to identify those things
    <br>that may hinder your movement towards God.
    <br>We are in the presence of God.
    <br>Remember, it is not all up to God and certainly, it is not all up to you.
    <br>It is high time that we sit down to identify those things
    <br>that may hinder our movement towards God.
    <br>It could be impatience, disobedience, anger, insensitive words, perhaps hatred.
    <br>Identify them.
    <br>I pray the Holy Spirit will help our weakness and turn it to the strength of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>No matter what your yesterday was like,
    <br>tell your neighbor, "The best is yet to come".
    <br>No matter what my yesterday was like, the best is yet to come.
    <br>Indeed, the best is yet to come.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to thank my father in the Lord
    <br>whom God is using mightily in the entire world,
    <br>for his endless efforts in my life.
    <br>I never believed I could be part of this glorious grace
    <br>because I am an embodiment of the impossible.
    <br>Here I am today.
    <br>All glory to His name!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is hope!
    <br>Brethren, Jesus is the hope.
    <br>That same God that turned my misery into success today,
    <br>that turned my name to success,
    <br>will turn every impossibility in your life possible, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That same God will turn your failure to success, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That same God will turn your sickness into good health!
    <br>That same God will turn your mess into a message, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That same God will turn your test into a testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word, in Jesus' name!
