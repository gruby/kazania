    <br>It's not only her - there is a brother in the family too that has this problem, it's not only her.
    <br>I see.
    <br>Okay, so no problem. This is a family problem and I will see you..
    <br>Watch how the lady receives her deliverance through the prayer of Prophet T. B. Joshua.
    <br>Prophet T. B. Joshua is used as a channel of healing and deliverance
    <br>where there is sickness and affliction in the lives of these people.
    <br>He prays for them, delivering them in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>setting them free from their bondages.
    <br>Among them is the lady from the USA.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Church, my name is Susan Chai, this is my mother Jong Su Choi.
    <br>We're from the United States and we are Korean.
    <br>You're very welcome.
    <br>So, our sister says they are originally Korean but living in the United States of America.
    <br>So could you share with us your testimony, starting off with the problems
    <br>that brought you to The Synagogue Church of All Nations.
    <br>When I was 13 years old, I started doing drugs
    <br>and started smoking cigarettes and drinking at parties on the weekends at social events.
    <br>As I gradually grew older, my addiction became worse.
    <br>I started using it at home,
    <br>I started doing it in my everyday life routines and it affected my schoolwork,
    <br>it affected my family, it affected everyone around me.
    <br>Even when I was coming to The SCOAN, I was still smoking,
    <br>I was still under the influence of drugs and...
    <br>Okay, just before talking about what happened when you came here,
    <br>could you tell us how severe this addiction was.
    <br>How much of these drugs were you taking every single day?
    <br>I was smoking marijuana, doing ecstasy, doing cocaine every single day and my parents sent me
    <br>to several treatment facilities but I was unable to get better until I actually came to The SCOAN.
    <br>My mother would pray for me every single day but nothing would change me.
    <br>I would still go out and party every single day.
    <br>I would be talking to guys all the time and I wouldn't focus on my schoolwork or go to work.
    <br>I would just concentrate on my well-being as a partygoer and not as a spiritual being.
    <br>Okay, could you just give us an example of the type of hard drugs you were taking?
    <br>I was taking marijuana, ecstasy and cocaine and I was smoking one to two packs of cigarettes a day.
    <br>Okay, when you were under the influence of these drugs,
    <br>just give us an example of what happened to you then.
    <br>What are the kind of things you would do to yourself?
    <br>How would this influence you to misbehave?
    <br>I developed a mood disorder where I'd get depressed, anxious and angry at everyone around me,
    <br>especially at my mother. I would yell at her every time she would try to interrupt my conversations
    <br>or try to tell me to come to eat at the dinner table with the family
    <br>or tell me to do something and go somewhere with her.
    <br>I would just get frustrated and yell at her.
    <br>This affected my family life, my relationships with everyone around me
    <br>and my parents even threatened me to send me to a shelter home.
    <br>Right before I came here, my sister and I stopped getting along.
    <br>She would yell at me every single day.
    <br>She would yell at my parents all the time and blame them for my well-being.
    <br>I tried to commit suicide several times in the past by suffocating myself,
    <br>by choking myself and my mom would hear me cry and she would come to my room,
    <br>break the door open and pry the pillow case away from my face.
    <br>I started when I was 13 years old and I'm 30 years old now and so it's been 17 years.
    <br>17 years. Could you just tell us - where there times that perhaps you would run away from the home,
    <br>your parents would be looking for you and you would not be in the house for a long period of time
    <br>because you'd be out partying and going to various clubs?
    <br>Yes, I wouldn't come home for weeks and nights and my parents would call me
    <br>and I wouldn't pick up their phone calls, they would be worried about me.
    <br>They would threaten to call the police on me again.
    <br>They did that several times.
    <br>I would go into the hospital often - maybe like once every six months
    <br>I would be in the hospital and I would be sent to facility treatment centers
    <br>because of not coming home and out partying and doing drugs all the time.
    <br>Okay, and what efforts did you make to try and stop?
    <br>Did you ever try, maybe, going to rehabilitation centres?
    <br>Just give us an example of the efforts you made to stop.
    <br>I did try going to rehab facilities, treatment centres and I also tried a nicotine patch, nicotine gum,
    <br>I also tried lozenges, all types of non-smoking aids to help me quit smoking and stop doing drugs,
    <br>but nothing helped until I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Okay, and just tell us, each time you'd go to rehab, what would happen when you came out?
    <br>I would relapse every time I came out of rehab and all my hospitalizations,
    <br>I would go right back in and come right back out.
    <br>Just give us an idea of how many times you have gone in and out of rehab because of this.
    <br>I went various times in New Jersey in New York - maybe over 20 times.
    <br>So people of God, we can understand what our sister is saying.
    <br>More than 20 times she has gone to rehabilitation centers in an attempt to stop
    <br>the intoxicating influence of these drugs, cigarettes, alcohol,
    <br>but any time she went to the rehabilitation centres upon returning back home
    <br>she would fall straight back into the same trap and return with this addiction.
    <br>So sister, could you just tell us what actually happened that led you to come to The SCOAN?
    <br>My mother heard that The SCOAN heals those who are sick through the man of God -
    <br>my mum had heard about it through a friend, Shelly, and we came together two weeks ago.
    <br>She left earlier. On behalf of Prophet T. B. Joshua, my mother and I stayed
    <br>so I can give this testimony to the world and to those
    <br>who are going through the same thing as I was going through.
    <br>Before your mum's friend told her about The SCOAN, did you yourself have any idea about the church?
    <br>Did you know about The SCOAN or Emmanuel TV?
    <br>No, I did not.
    <br>I just thought that I was coming to another revival but I didn't know I would find freedom in Christ.
    <br>So, your mum just brought you here; you had no knowledge of what was going to happen?
    <br>Now, when you arrived, what was your condition when you arrived in the church?
    <br>I was still smoking cigarettes,
    <br>I was just thinking about drinking a beer,
    <br>I was thinking about doing drugs,
    <br>until on Sunday, I met the man of God and he prophesied that I was sick
    <br>and there's someone in the family who is sick as well.
    <br>Since then, I knew that I would be healed.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We saw that after that prophecy, the man of God then prayed for you in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Can you describe what happened when he prayed for you?
    <br>As soon as the man of God prayed for me, the spirit of anger left my body.
    <br>I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders and off my body
    <br>and the whole injury on the right side of my body lifted off and is healed.
    <br>My vision is a lot clearer.
    <br>I'm able to speak clearer,
    <br>to have a conversation with my parents in a mannerly way,
    <br>rather than yelling and screaming and being frustrated at them as I was before.
    <br>And that urge to take alcohol, drugs, cigarettes - ever since that touch,
    <br>just tell us the changes you've seen in your life in that area.
    <br>Ever since I was delivered by the man of God, I no longer have the urge
    <br>to smoke cigarettes or do drugs or drink alcohol.
    <br>I'm healed. Praise God.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>We saw there how Jesus Christ touched our sister at the point of her need and completely delivered her.
    <br>Sister, we can actually see some of those cigarettes in front of you.
    <br>Could you just describe to us what it is we are seeing here and what you can say about these?
    <br>These are the cigarettes that were confiscated while I was here at The SCOAN during the week of my stay.
    <br>Prophet T. B. Joshua accommodated us here, when we came from the States.
    <br>We didn't have an invitation, but he let us stay here for two-and-a-half weeks now.
    <br>He's been praying for us, he's been watching over us and he's been doing everything
    <br>in his power for me to get healed and for me to remain healed.
    <br>Amen; thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>So, our sister's explaining that the packets of cigarettes
    <br>we're actually seeing in front, were what she brought with her from the United States,
    <br>but since the deliverance she received, she has completely stopped taking them.
    <br>She formerly took one to two packets every day aside from taking hard drugs,
    <br>but since that divine touch from Jesus Christ, she's been completely set free.
    <br>So right now, we want to hear a few words from her mother.
    <br>Madam, you are very welcome in Jesus' name.
    <br>Could you please introduce yourself to us and tell us what can you say about
    <br>the testimony that your daughter has just given.
    <br>Miss Susan Choi & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Mrs Jong Su Choi
    <br>USA
    <br>My mother's name is Jong Su Choi, we're from America, and she says that we're South Korean.
    <br>Miss Susan Choi & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Too much anger, too much joy, funny, too much crying.
    <br>She says that I had an anger problem, I had a mood disorder for ten years
    <br>and it's been affecting the family and our relationships since then.
    <br>Miss Susan Choi & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Before coming here, my dad and my sister said that it would be our last chance coming to Nigeria.
    <br>If I don't get healed and I come back to the States, I will be sent to a shelter if this doesn't work out.
    <br>Miss Susan Choi & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>In order for my daughter to be healed, God has provided a way for us to be here today.
    <br>Miss Susan Choi & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Thank You, God! 
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I'm so thankful for my daughter to be healed today.
    <br>Thank You, God! 
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Amen, let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Could you tell us the changes you have seen in your daughter?
    <br>Tell us her condition before the prayer and the changes after the prayer.
    <br>Miss Susan Choi & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Mental problem.
    <br>Miss Susan Choi & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My parents were about to get divorced because of my mental Issues and my mood disorder,
    <br>where I would get very angry.
    <br>I would get very joyous, I would laugh and cry.
    <br>My dad couldn't handle the fact that I was sick, so he wanted to divorce my mother.
    <br>Miss Susan Choi & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My mum says that now, after I've been prayed for and I'm healed,
    <br>I can sleep well, I can eat well, and I'm happy in Christ's name and she's very happy about that.
    <br>Amen, let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, I hope, people of God, we are understanding what our mother is saying.
    <br>The condition of our sister here, her daughter, was so critical
    <br>that it reached the point where her parents were about to divorce because of her situation.
    <br>They had even given them an ultimatum;
    <br>her father had given her an ultimatum that if she returned from Nigeria and did not change,
    <br>she would be sent to a homeless shelter.
    <br>That is, denied as their child because of this severe addiction to drugs,
    <br>cigarettes and alcohol that was bringing shame and disgrace to the family.
    <br>But today, mother and daughter are standing here free,
    <br>delivered and completely restored after an encounter with Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's put our hands together one more time for Jesus.
    <br>So, our mother, we'd like to ask you right now - what is your advice to viewers,
    <br>especially to those who may have children who are experiencing such an addicition?
    <br>Miss Susan Choi & Mother
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My mom wants to give the advice that God is glorified throughout the earth
    <br>and that He does not want you to suffer.
    <br>He wants you to be rejoiced through His Word.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Amen, let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So now, for our sister who actually received this incredible deliverance and freedom,
    <br>we'd like to ask you sister right now -
    <br>what is your own word of advice to viewers around the world,
    <br>especially those who may be under the influence of such drugs, alcohol, cigarettes;
    <br>as someone that has passed through that and today is free - what is your advice?
    <br>For me to have freedom in Christ, it shows that God is able and He does not give up on you.
    <br>He still loves you and forgives you, no matter who you are, no matter what you do.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>And finally sister, these cigarettes we're seeing here -
    <br>what do you want to do right now, that you are delivered?
    <br>I don't even want to look at it.
