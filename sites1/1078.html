  <p>    
    <br>I want to appeal to you that I too need healing.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The moment I stretch my hand to pray for the sick, the one that is sick in me...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The one that has cold will just...
    <br>So, you have to allow me to go and pray so that that one can leave me.
    <br>The name of that one is T.B. Joshua.
    <br>But the one that you are coming to meet is the Prophet.
    <br>By His stripes, we are healed.
    <br>I love praying when the environment is calm.
    <br>Because of that, I prefer praying when it is night, in a quiet place.
    <br>This time, the cold was so much and I had to go extreme,
    <br>exposing myself to that cold when I was praying.
    <br>That is how I got my cold.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It is your turn now to tell me how you normally get your cold.
    <br>Who is ready to tell me here?
    <br>If rain beats me, I get cold.
    <br>Oh my God. Thank you.
    <br>You know today that T.B. Joshua and Prophet are entirely two different natures.
    <br>They are entirely two different persons.
    <br>Each time there is a miracle, you will always see me, "Please, let's move!"
    <br>I will not start asking, "Hee, how does it happen?" - No!
    <br>The work of miracle is not from T.B. Joshua; it is from God.
    <br>It is not the work of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have a stiff neck due to cervical spondylosis.
    <br>I am using a neck collar. I have been having this problem for the past 12 years.
    <br>Help me, Man of God.
    <br>It has stopped me from going to work.
    <br>I can't do the work I used to do when I was still healthy.
    <br>Man of God, please, help me.
    <br>When you receive your healing, you say, "We are healed"; not, "I am healed".
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you receive your healing now, when you want to testify, you say,
    <br>"We are healed; including T.B. Joshua!"
    <br>You people normally say, "I am healed, I am healed", as if we too are not healed.
    <br>We are healed, including T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This man, you are not serious.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok, thank You.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Remove it.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Turn your neck.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am healed.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You said, "I am healed". Are you removing me from the healing?
    <br>This man is very stubborn.
    <br>I said, "We are healed". He said, "I am healed".
    <br>When you say, "We are healed", it means I will get my healing too.
    <br>Continue shaking until you know the right thing to say.
    <br>We have disturbed him for long.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>Since 1997, we have been sent to kill him.
    <br>This is a different man oo.
    <br>Why? The man is a very strong man - we would have killed him.
    <br>We want to kill him because of his education.
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>I am lucifer.
    <br>He is healed. Can you carry lucifer here.

    <br>What do you want to say now?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Brethren, help me to thank God for having healed me after a long time of trouble.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>That is for forgetting what I told you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for having delivered me.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>This man is very selfish. Carry your miracle.

    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Oh! Ha! Hallelujah!
    <br>You show me the Bible today.
    <br>I am Gifty. I come from Ghana.
    <br>I have difficulty in walking. I have osteoarthritis. I am using a knee brace.
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>You see - you that are not being prayed for, are the ones that are more healed.
    <br>Listen!
    <br>You receive more blessing than the people who are being prayed for.
    <br>Let me tell you the reason.
    <br>You pay attention to what is happening.
    <br>That attention is increasing your faith.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. We are healed.
    <br>You pay attention to what is going on and that automatically draws you closer to God,
    <br>than even the people that are being prayed for.
    <br>I'm telling you.
    <br>Each miracle enhances your faith.
    <br>You find yourself growing bigger in God.
    <br>You are closer to God than the people that are receiving healing.
    <br>Each miracle reminds you of who you were, who you are and who you will be.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Each miracle reminds me of who I was, who I am and who I will be".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Oh, I thought it was like this; right I can see."
    <br>"I never knew God is the same. What I read in the Bible, I can see it clearly."
    <br>"Oh my God, I am sorry".
    <br>It's now very clear to you, "Oh yes, I can see why these things are being persecuted".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What people do not know, they persecute.
    <br>What they know, they destroy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever they don't know about you, and you are doing it and it is happening,
    <br>and they are trying to know how you do it and they don't know how you do it,
    <br>they will persecute you.
    <br>But if they know how you do it, they will kill you and take it up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So therefore, those things God has given you as a mystery -
    <br>mystery means like you market women, business man,
    <br>you have whatever career - are you a doctor, lawyer - and you are flourishing,
    <br>and some of your colleagues keep asking themselves, "How manage?"
    <br>This is going like this way for you and it is not going that way for them.
    <br>They are trying to know how you are doing it and they don't know.
    <br>They will persecute you and call you names and do all sort of things.
    <br>But if they know exactly how you are doing it, they will kill and destroy you.
    <br>That is what you too are going through.
    <br>What you are seeing now, it is only God - just only God!
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because it does not cost anything; it's effortless.
    <br>And what is effortless, you cannot demand money for it.
    <br>But because you want to collect money, you now try to sweat,
    <br>you try to show some labour and effort; to show you have laboured and suffered,
    <br>so that you can demand for money.
    <br>Those things that are effortless - if you are able to exercise such a thing in the presence of people,
    <br>you can't ask them to bring money.
    <br>Money is all about labour.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is it. I am giving my testimony.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I come from Namibia.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
