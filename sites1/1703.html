    <br>Idol Charms Exposed During The SCOAN Mass Prayer With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Many of these are invisible and the Lord made it visible.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>My name is Patience Yebo, I am from Ghana.
    <br>These images were made before I was born.
    <br>My mother is an idol worshipper.
    <br>She gave birth to twins.
    <br>When she gave birth to twins, the twins died.
    <br>When they died, these particular images were made.
    <br>When I was given birth to, I was told that they were my brothers
    <br>and that I should be taking care of them.
    <br>I have been giving them food.
    <br>We eat from the same plate.
    <br>I was carrying it on my back when it fell and the leg broke.
    <br>They told me that since the leg broke, my leg would be hurting me
    <br>so they had to create another image.
    <br>Then they went in for these ones.
    <br>I have been working but nothing.
    <br>Nobody at all in the family is doing anything.
    <br>Everybody is a zero in the family.
    <br>These things, when I was working, they were disturbing me.
    <br>I would see them physically for some minutes then,
    <br>all of a sudden, they would go.
    <br>They would become human beings and I would be screaming and shouting.
    <br>In the evenings, I will not sleep.
    <br>In the mornings, I will not pass anywhere; where I pass, they are there.
    <br>They say they need water; I should give them water to drink.
    <br>Sometimes, when I am carrying water, I give it to them when I see them.
    <br>I will see them drinking the water.
    <br>I went to my uncle who is a spiritualist and he said that it was true
    <br>when I said that they were worrying me.
    <br>They love me and I am their carrier so, I should be taking care of them.
    <br>They have small pots whereby I should be putting money inside.
    <br>When my uncle told me that, I asked him how come he knew all this.
    <br>He said they love me and I should be eating yam and tilapia fish.
    <br>When I am eating it, they are eating it with me.
    <br>My uncle sent for yam and tilapia fish at the spiritual house.
    <br>The yam and tilapia fish were cooked and put before me.
    <br>Then, my uncle divided my hair into two and put some yam and tilapia there.
    <br>He said that as I was eating it on the ground, they were eating it on my head.
    <br>I thought that with all these things he did, I would be OK but it became worse.
    <br>OK. So before you were born, these images had been made
    <br>and you were told that your mother had twins before you were born and they died,
    <br>and they made these images.
    <br>When you were born, you were told to take care of them, to serve them and...
    <br>I bathe them, I pomade them and when I am sleeping, I put them before my bed.
    <br>I petter them because I thought it was something good because they said that
    <br>if I didn't they would kill me, my career, they would disturb my life
    <br>and nothing would go on in my life.
    <br>Since you have been taking care of them and worshipping them,
    <br>what has been happening in your life?
    <br>Since I have been taking care of them and worshipping them,
    <br>what they said would not happen has been happening.
    <br>I wanted to go to school but these things said I could not go to school;
    <br>that was what my uncle, the seer told me.
    <br>He said that they could not allow me to go to school because if I went to school,
    <br>and become great, I would not serve them anymore.
    <br>So your uncle who is a spiritualist is the one talking on their behalf?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But these images don't talk?
    <br>They don't talk; he invokes their spirits.
    <br>He is a seer; he threw some cowries on the ground
    <br>and was chanting some things over them.
    <br>So you have been made to believe from the time your twin brothers...
    <br>I took them as my twin brothers.
    <br>And you worshipped them, made sacrifices to them?
    <br>Yes, I give them food and I eat with them.
    <br>They said they liked fruit so I have been giving them bananas.
    <br>I even had an accident.
    <br>These things made me have an accident;
    <br>it was by the grace of God, I did not die.
    <br>I went to my grandmother and she showed me
    <br>the place where they were buried.
    <br>They said I should go in for some drinks; they needed drinks.
    <br>I went and bought the drinks.
    <br>They poured it on their graves.
    <br>They were not buried inside a coffin.
    <br>They just dug a hole and put them inside because they were very young.
    <br>My mum told me that when she gave birth to them,
    <br>they were not even seven days old when they died because of suffering.
    <br>OK. Tell us what happened when the anointed man of God was offering the mass prayer.
    <br>What happened to you before you found yourself outside here?
    <br>When he was praying, I saw that something was moving in my legs.
    <br>I thought that maybe it was because I had removed my sandals.
    <br>When I put on my sandals, I still felt the sensation inside my legs.
    <br>Then, all of a sudden, my hands became stiff; I couldn't move my hands anymore.
    <br>Now, I can move it but first, my hand was very stiff.
    <br>The moment Prophet T.B. Joshua said, "Let there be calmness,"
    <br>it would become stiffer.
    <br>I wanted him to stop saying that because it was making my hands stiff.
    <br>That was why I came out and threw them there.
