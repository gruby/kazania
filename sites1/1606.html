  <p>    
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Whilst we are still standing, I want you to join me in giving thanks to God for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Do you know the reason why I say we should give thanks to God?
    <br>One of the questions that has been asked so many times over the years is:
    <br>"Why does Prophet T.B. Joshua not respond to the various attacks
    <br>that are being levelled against him, the lies that are being peddled against him?
    <br>Why does he choose to remain silent?"
    <br>And I also used to ask this question,
    <br>as someone that God has blessed so mightily through this ministry.
    <br>I would see the things people say, the lies, the propaganda.
    <br>I say, "Why doesn't he respond?"
    <br>But I now understand.
    <br>I understand this:
    <br>Emmanuel TV is God's response!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I repeat:
    <br>Emmanuel TV is God's response to whatever they are saying.
    <br>Do you know; as we are talking right now, people are watching Emmanuel TV in different time zones,
    <br>speaking different languages, from different backgrounds,
    <br>but they are connected because of the power of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Day in, day out, we receive testimonies;
    <br>people's marriages restored, people's homes reunited,
    <br>addictions broken, people's sick bodies healed, lives changed, souls saved
    <br>through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>How could anyone question so much evidence?
    <br>We, that don't have God's response - we respond on our own - we fight back.
    <br>If they abuse us, we abuse back.
    <br>But in this case God Himself has given a clear response.
    <br>And when God is with you, no one can stand.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>You may have your seats right now, in the presence of God.
    <br>Today I have a very important and probing question that I want you to ask yourself.
    <br>You know, Prophet T.B. Joshua says that
    <br>there are few things more dangerous than a person with an unexamined life.
    <br>This is an opportunity in the House of God, in the presence of God
    <br>for you to examine yourself, to check yourself.
    <br>And how do we do this?
    <br>We do it in the light of God's Word.
    <br>I'm gonna read a Scripture to you.
    <br>The Book of Romans 6:20-21.
    <br>Verse 21 is the key-verse but I read from verse 20.
    <br>When I read this verse, I want you to personalize it
    <br>and ask yourself this question that apostle Paul is asking.
    <br>The Holy Bible is the only Book that reads us even as we read it.
    <br>So, don't just read the Bible like a history book or a novel or a textbook in school.
    <br>You should insert your name where the message is personal
    <br>and reflect on your own journey through life.
    <br>I'm gonna read Romans 6, I will start from verse 20; the key-verse is 21.
    <br>It says this:
    <br>"When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.
    <br>What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of?
    <br>Those things result in death!"
    <br>Very quickly jump with me to Galatians 5, verses 19-21.
    <br>And the Scripture says this:
    <br>"The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;
    <br>idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions
    <br>and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like.
    <br>I warn you, as I did before,
    <br>that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God."
    <br>I said I had a very probing question for you today
    <br>and it is very simply taken from these Scriptures.
    <br>You can insert any of the fruits of the flesh that were mentioned there -
    <br>I will just pick a couple - and ask yourself this question:
    <br>What benefit did you reap from jealousy?
    <br>Turn to your neighbour, look at them and say,
    <br>"Neighbour, what benefit did you reap from jealousy?"
    <br>What benefit did you reap from selfish ambition?
    <br>It's a very direct question and I want you to examine your life and answer it.
    <br>You don't have to verbally answer it to me.
    <br>Reflect on your life and consider your own journey.
    <br>What benefit did you reap in your life from selfish ambition?
    <br>What benefit did you reap from hatred?
    <br>What benefit did you reap from sexual immorality?
    <br>What benefit did you reap from impurity or idolatry?
    <br>If we are sincere with ourselves, I think you would agree with me
    <br>that the results of jealousy, envy, bitterness, pride, sexual immorality, impurity -
    <br>just name it - the results of these things in your life has brought nothing but damage.
    <br>Would you agree?
    <br>I'm not seeing you - would you agree?
    <br>Remember; no one knows you better than you know yourself.
    <br>This is a time for you to ask yourself this question.
    <br>Don't just say, "Yes" because your neighbour says "Yes".
    <br>Examine yourself!
    <br>Check yourself!
    <br>None of us are perfect; we know where we are coming from.
    <br>In the past we have slipped into such fruits of the flesh.
    <br>What benefit did we reap?
    <br>Some of you may say, "Perhaps there was a temporary pleasure or a momentary boost".
    <br>If we are sincere, you would agree with me that the benefits you reap from such acts of the flesh
    <br>do nothing but damage your heart and damage your home,
    <br>damage your relationships, damage your destiny.
    <br>Your own life experience is enough of an evidence for you to realise this.
    <br>The challenge now and the worrying thing at this point when you recognise, realise and admit this
    <br>is that it is common today for people to regularly repeat what they know has damaged them.
    <br>If you look at what is happening in society,
    <br>you see people repeating what has caused them damage, what has destroyed them.
    <br>Let me try and be very practical.
    <br>It's like me coming to these fruits; see this beautiful fruit, it looks amazing and I will take a bite.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After swallowing I suddenly realise, "This fruit I have taken is poisoned!"
    <br>How do I know?
    <br>Instantly, I feel sick!
    <br>Instantly, my body begins to react.
    <br>Instantly, I begin to have this nausea, I feel like I need to be sick,
    <br>everything about my system begins to be affected because I have taken poison!
    <br>Why would anyone go back to the same apple
    <br>and take another bite?
    <br>You may laugh, but this is exactly what many of us are doing in our daily lives.
    <br>What benefit did you reap from jealousy?
    <br>Many of us today are still jealous.
    <br>What benefit did you reap from offence?
    <br>You have listened to countless sermons, teachings and messages
    <br>talking about the danger of harbouring unforgiveness, holding offence.
    <br>We have been inspired, moved, motivated as we hear the sermon in the church,
    <br>yet, so often we go back to our daily lives
    <br>and before you know it, you slip back into the same offence you vowed you would never go back to.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, I want to make a very clear point here.
    <br>Why do we so often return to these things?
    <br>I would suggest to you, it is because of what we have given our hearts to.
    <br>Instead of our heart being dominated by the truth of God's Word,
    <br>today it is so common for us to focus on ourselves -
    <br>"How I'm doing? How I'm feeling? How I'm treated?" -
    <br>or to focus on what other people are saying - what people are saying about you,
    <br>the opinions of others about you.
    <br>Or you focus on what the world is saying - the standards, the trends of the world.
    <br>And the result of this is that it blinds you from reality.
    <br>The reality is the consequence of your actions.
    <br>You know: "If I take this bite, it's gonna poison me!",
    <br>but you say, "Well, the apple looks very nice.
    <br>Perhaps this time, if I bite it, it will be different from last time.
    <br>Do you not know that everyone in my school is biting this apple?
    <br>It is the normal thing.
    <br>My friends said I should try it; it's very good.
    <br>Have you read the review on Amazon? Five stars.
    <br>How can I not eat it?"
    <br>You convince yourself that it would not have the same results.
    <br>Even though you have tasted it before and it was damaging and destructive,
    <br>but still, because your focus is elsewhere, what do you do?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People of God,
    <br>today the title of the message is very simple:
    <br>LISTEN TO THE SERMON OF YOUR LIFE
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Listen to the sermon of your life".
    <br>If you take time to study your own life, your experiences,
    <br>what you have tasted and the repercussions,
    <br>what you have eaten and the results,
    <br>you will know the importance of taking care of your spiritual life.
    <br>Just listen to the sermon of your life.
    <br>Whether we are young or old, we have had enough experiences.
    <br>God would not come down from heaven and stop you from eating this apple.
    <br>You are the one that has to take that stand, take that step because you know the danger,
    <br>you know the damage, you know the destruction.
    <br>This is your own part; this is your own role.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, listen to the sermon of your life".
    <br>I want to quickly jump to Galatians again.
    <br>Galatians 5:16-17.
    <br>It says this:
    <br>"So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
    <br>For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.
    <br>They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want."
    <br>What is the Scripture saying here?
    <br>There is a constant conflict in the heart of man between the flesh and the spirit.
    <br>Why am I emphasizing this?
    <br>I have had the incredible privilege of living in this church for many years,
    <br>by God's grace, working in the house of God,
    <br>and I used to think to myself from the human perspective
    <br>that perhaps one day all of these troubles and temptations would just disappear
    <br>because I've been working in the church for so long.
    <br>Maybe one day you would just have that freedom in your heart,
    <br>there would be no disturbance of the heart, no temptation of the flesh or fleshly desires -
    <br>that's what I used to think.
    <br>But the truth, brethren, is different.
    <br>The truth is that the battle in your heart will never end.
    <br>The thoughts in our hearts is the battle we will face to the last day.
    <br>Being a Christian does not remove the battle, it does not eradicate the battle.
    <br>Being a Christian equips you to fight the battle.
    <br>It does not remove temptation.
    <br>Being a Christian does not mean you can't be tempted with the things of the flesh.
    <br>Of course you can.
    <br>But being a Christian strengthens you to overcome the battle.
    <br>All of us who have fallen faced temptation and made a decision.
    <br>All of us who have not fallen faced a similar temptation but made a different decision.
    <br>It is not that you will not face it.
    <br>You will face temptation.
    <br>You will.
    <br>There is no shortcut in our Christian walk that will avoid the temptations of the flesh.
    <br>So it is not what you face; it is how you face them,
    <br>how to handle them, how you react, how you respond.
    <br>And today's message that I want to really bring across to you is that
    <br>your response to that temptation, your reaction to those desires of the flesh
    <br>that are trying to prompt and provoke and prod you into things outside of God -
    <br>your reaction depends on what is dominating your heart,
    <br>what you are giving your heart to, what you are feeding your soul with.
    <br>There is no substitute for this.
    <br>If your heart is full of the things of the flesh,
    <br>in your heart you are busy thinking about the things of the flesh,
    <br>you are busy thinking about material things, giving your heart to the pursuit of fleshly desires,
    <br>when you face a temptation, you are going to respond to the flesh - even when it's lying.
    <br>Many times the flesh will give you a message that seems like it is truth but in fact it is a lie
    <br>but because your heart is given away to the things of the flesh, what happens?
    <br>You easily succumb, you easily slip, you easily fall even when you have tasted it before
    <br>and it was damaging, you still go back to it.
    <br>Now, I want one volunteer, but someone who is very very tall.
    <br>If you know you are very very tall, stand up.
    <br>OK, thank you very much, sir. Come forward.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>I think our brother is fairly tall.
    <br>Now, if there is anyone here who is very very small,
    <br>pretty small, relatively small, you have a small stature - just stand up.
    <br>OK, thank you very much, madam - God bless you.
    <br>You just stand just here.
    <br>Come a bit closer, sir.
    <br>In fact, I want you to come very close.
    <br>Now, on a very practical notes...
    <br>Remove spirituality from this scenario.
    <br>If this man enters a fight with this lady, who do you think will win?
    <br>The man!
    <br>It is not too difficult to understand this because he is bigger, taller, he has more strength on the outside.
    <br>Now, I put this to you people of God:
    <br>Why is it that you wonder why you return to temptation and what has damaged you?
    <br>Why, when you are busy feeding your flesh and neglecting you spirit?
    <br>You are giving your attention, time, devotion, interest to the things of the flesh,
    <br>feeding them with what you watch, what you hear, what you listen to,
    <br>and your things of the spirit are neglected, put by the side,
    <br>only looked up perhaps when you have a problem,
    <br>or on Sunday when you go to church.
    <br>By the time the temptation comes, which way do you think you will swing?
    <br>You will come in the direction of the flesh.
    <br>Why? Because you have given more attention, food, ability, strength to the things of the flesh,
    <br>so that when temptation comes, the things of the spirit you easily succumb.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Check yourself.
    <br>Listen to the sermon of your life."
    <br>I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.
    <br>You say, "Why am I eating this apple again? I've tasted it.
    <br>I know the damage of sexual immorality, the damage of lust."
    <br>But because we are watching things that produce and promote lust,
    <br>and we are having discussions on Facebook that celebrate lust,
    <br>and we are listening to films and watching movies that celebrate lust,
    <br>we are easily slipping to the very same thing that destroyed our home.
    <br>Thank you very much. Please, take the fruits to the glory of God.
    <br>Don't worry, these are not poisonous.
    <br>Take your fruits and you may return to your seats.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, I want to read another Scriptures for you, as we are coming to a conclusion.
    <br>Galatians 6:7-8
    <br>Please, take note of these vital truths.
    <br>The Scripture says this:
    <br>"Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
    <br>Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction;
    <br>whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life."
    <br>Full stop.
    <br>What is ruling your heart?
    <br>The Spirit or the senses, the Word or the world?
    <br>As I round this message up, I want to use our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>as an example of someone whose life is continually sowing to the Spirit.
    <br>The reason you are here today - I put this to you, people of God...
    <br>The reason you are here today; you travelled from your country, state,
    <br>you took a long journey...
    <br>Some of us had to take a flight, in the midst of these economic challenges -
    <br>we came all the way to Nigeria, to this rural part of Lagos...
    <br>The reason why we are here today is not because you want to hear an eloquent speaker,
    <br>a charismatic speaker.
    <br>There are many charismatic preachers in your country.
    <br>You are not here today to hear beautiful songs from the choir.
    <br>There are many wonderful musicians, song writers in your country that you can listen to
    <br>and enjoy and worship God with.
    <br>You are not here today because of this beautiful cathedral.
    <br>There are many wonderfully built beautiful edifices and architectural giants in your country.
    <br>You are here today because of the anointng of the Holy Spirit!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That's why we are here.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has paid the price to create an environment where the Holy Spirit is free to flow.
    <br>When you talk of Synagogue - it is not just when the man of God prays for you that you receive.
    <br>As you walk into this environment, healing takes place.
    <br>You've seen people; they just walked on to the altar -
    <br>just stepped in on the altar - boom, they are healed.
    <br>You see people; when the choir is singing "Sins power over you is broken" - boom, they are delivered.
    <br>You see people just by taking the Living Water - Prophet T.B. Joshua is not even there -
    <br>they just take it; they receive!
    <br>Because the anointing of the Holy Spirit is here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because Prophet T.B. Joshua sows to the Spirit.
    <br>You see the fruits on Sunday, but he sacrifices from Monday to Saturday.
    <br>And today it seems as if the fire is reducing in the church.
    <br>Because even in the church we are more concerned about things of the flesh than things of the Spirit.
    <br>Why is the fire reducing in church today?
    <br>People are more concerned about building branches than building character.
    <br>When people are more concerned about the number of times people applaud in the sermon,
    <br>rather than the amount of changes that sermon produces.
    <br>When people are more concerned about the amount of tithe and offerings that are dropped,
    <br>rather than the number of souls that are being saved.
    <br>All over the world there is a trend right now
    <br>that more and more people have stopped going to church.
    <br>Church attendance seems to be decreasing.
    <br>But, in the midst of this, Emmanuel TV viewership is increasing.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because of the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Let us sow to the Spirit.
    <br>If you sow to the flesh, you will reap of the flesh.
    <br>If you sow to the Spirit, you will reap peace of heart.
    <br>If you sow to the Spirit, you will reap eternal joy.
    <br>If you sow to the Spirit, you will reap assurance of life.
    <br>If you sow to the Spirit, you will reap freedom from fear.
    <br>If you sow to the Spirit, you will reap the security of God's presence.
    <br>In conclusion.
    <br>What is preventing the Word of God from dominating our hearts?
    <br>It is because our human will has not wholly surrendered to God;
    <br>there is still part flesh, part spirit in the heart of man.
    <br>We have not wholly surrendered.
    <br>So, if there is any "take away" you can take from this messages;
    <br>you listened to the sermon of your life - it's this.
    <br>Now is the time for your life to reflect your lips when you sing this song, "I surrender all".
    <br>Not, "I surrender some. I surrender when I feel like it. I surrender when it is convenient for me.
    <br>I surrender on Sunday. I surrender when there are challenges.
    <br>I surrender when there is hard times."
    <br>I surrender all.
    <br>If you give in to God, you will not cave in to sin.
    <br>When the Word of God dominates your heart, it will preserve and protect you from desiring sin.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
