  <p>    
    <br>We are looking at people sitting down, complaining about one thing and the other.
    <br>I know you too, you have your own challenges.
    <br>The question is: What is about to happen?
    <br>Going by what we have spoken about, if you put the whole message together,  you will agree with me that
    <br>Jesus will never move us to pray for something without being sanctioned by the Scripture;
    <br>it must be sanctioned by the Scripture.
    <br>Like what we have said today
    <br>that your heart must act upon the Word
    <br>because the power to heal comes,
    <br>power to deliver comes, power to save comes not by saying words.
    <br>"Be healed!". Without the help of the Holy Spirit, I'm saying words.
    <br>"Be delivered!". Without the backing of the Holy Spirit, I am just saying words.
    <br>Power to heal, power to deliver and power to bless comes not by saying words, but by praying prayer.
    <br>Because saying words is not praying prayer.
    <br>Praying prayer is not saying words. Take note of that.
    <br>Maybe you have seen me doing "Be healed!". You now get home and start doing the same thing.
    <br>Because, "Be healed!" - if you see that healing happen, it is not that word,
    <br>but that word has been affected by the Holy Spirit. That is why it works.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>I say, "Be healed!" and you too want to say it. The same thing happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>When they saw Paul saying, "Be healed! Be delivered!", they too now went to say, "Be healed! Be delivered!".
    <br>They never knew that Paul's words were affected by the Holy Spirit. That is why it worked.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The power of God comes,
    <br>power to heal comes,
    <br>power to deliver comes
    <br>not by saying words,
    <br>but by praying prayer.
    <br>Like I have said, to pray in the Spirit means to pray in harmony with the Scripture,
    <br>in agreement with the Scripture, in accord with the Scripture. It must agree.
    <br>This is time to pray prayer in the Spirit that heals, that delivers.
    <br>My brother, you have listened to the message that was given? You have listened to that?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- What message are you taking home?
    <br>The message I am taking home is: We need to build God's character.
    <br>- You need to?
    <br>- Build God's character.
    <br>God's character. How are you building your own character with God's character now?
    <br>By meditating on the Word.
    <br>- Are you meditating now?
    <br>- Yes, I'm meditating.
    <br>Tell us what you are saying in your heart.
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy; locate me in Your favour, Lord.
    <br>You are asking God for something.
    <br>You are just asking God for something. You are not even asking for the character now.
    <br>Let me talk of character.
    <br>Ok, tell me how you are building God's character. Tell me what is going on in your heart.
    <br>In the beginning, you have to be filled.
    <br>You have to fill yourself with the Word.
    <br>Just like what happened to Peter and Jesus.
    <br>Jesus said to Peter, "Come with Me".
    <br>Jesus was on the sea.
    <br>He said, "Come with Me".
    <br>He said, "I want to come with You".
    <br>He said, "Come with Me".
    <br>In the beginning, he did not receive Jesus' support.
    <br>Jesus allowed him (to sink). He wanted to see the genuineness of Peter in the beginning.
    <br>Don't think that in the beginning
    <br>you don't have to do something yourself to show your genuineness - your genuine willingness.
    <br>Jesus said, "Come!".
    <br>And he thought that Jesus would start supporting him from the beginning, but He did not.
    <br>In the beginning he was just going and found himself sinking.
    <br>But, if there was no genuine willingness in him, he would go back because he was about to drown.
    <br>He was just sinking.
    <br>Jesus was looking at him and saying, "This man is coming, but he is sinking".
    <br>This sinking could lead to death, but he continued to move closer to God,
    <br>until the water was about to cover him.
    <br>Jesus realised, "This is genuine willingness".
    <br>Jesus now stretched His grace to lift him up,
    <br>and Peter found himself walking on the sea towards Jesus.
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>So, the same thing with you and your weakness.
    <br>If you are a smoker and you say, "If Jesus wants me to stop smoking, He must stop me".
    <br>You now say, "If Jesus doesn't want me to smoke, He should stop it".
    <br>"The urge is there. There is nothing I can do. He must be the One to stop me".
    <br>No, you must stop first.
    <br>You must apply your willingness that you are genuine - "I want to stop".
    <br>In the beginning when you stop that urge will continue to disturb you.
    <br>You say, "No, I am not going to go back to that cigarette".
    <br>It will continue to disturb you.
    <br>"No, I am not going to go back to that".
    <br>Jesus will now come to your rescue.
    <br>It is like that in the beginning.
    <br>The beginning of everything is always tough.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The beginning of everything is always tough.
    <br>If you start a business and the business is smooth in the beginning, know that there is danger ahead.
    <br>If you start a business and you find it very easy from the beginning, know that there is trouble in the future.
    <br>The beginning of everything is always tough - very tough. It is like that.
    <br>Right now you have started the business of meditation - constantly praying in your heart.
    <br>In the beginning ... oh my God.
    <br>You will say, "... I forgot to ...". Continue. Genuinely continue.
    <br>Your genuine willingness plus God's ability will take you there.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Your genuine willingness plus God's ability will take you there.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Your genuine willingness plus God's ability will take you there.
    <br>It will take you there. You have to be genuine when you start.
    <br>Start and wait for God's ability.
    <br>But in the beginning it will be very tough.
    <br>But before you know it, by the time God intervenes,
    <br>immediately what you will discover is you will no longer be the one praying.
    <br>You will just be praising God in your heart and suddenly it will switch from praise to prayer.
    <br>And you will not be the one doing it again.
    <br>You will be sitting down and you will find yourself speaking in tongues again.
    <br>You suddenly sit down and you start praising God. It will just be sweet.
    <br>Just like your blood - you have no control over your blood.
    <br>In the same way, you will continue to live your life.
    <br>But now you are the one struggling.
    <br>You are struggling. You will continue to struggle to pray.
    <br>You will struggle to fast.
    <br>Sometimes when you are fasting, an urge will come to eat.
    <br>"I'm hungry. I don't know whether to go and eat".
    <br>Already you have eaten.
    <br>Nursing it means you have what? You have eaten. It has affected your faith.
    <br>They will pray for you. You say, "I don't know whether to take this thing or not to take it".
    <br>"I don't know whether to go and check myself, whether I am healed or not".
    <br>Already you have destroyed your faith.
    <br>After healing and you are ok, "I am ok".
    <br>But something keeps telling you, "Go and check yourself".
    <br>"Go to the laboratory. Go and check your blood to see whether the thing is still there".
    <br>Already you have destroyed your faith.
    <br>Are you constantly praying? My brother?
    <br>- I'm praying.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>Don't stop.
    <br>By the time you build this, the Helper will come.
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Healed Of Stiff Neck
    <br>No Longer Using Neck Collar
    <br>Thank You. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>What we are doing now will help you to build your faith.
    <br>But after seeing all this, and your faith is not built, what else again?
    <br>What we have said is what we are doing now.
    <br>It is what we are doing.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>While I am standing now, I am in constant what?
    <br>Prayer in my heart, as I am standing.
    <br>That is why you will not hear me say, "Be loosed! Where are you satan? Be loosed!"
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>You will now say, "I'm filled with the Spirit".
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>I will now turn around to tell you ...
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>I'm constantly praying in my heart - prayer without ceasing.
    <br>Because my enemy loses no time in plotting against me;
    <br>I should lose no time in committing myself to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I'm in constant prayer in my heart
    <br>- prayer without ceasing -
    <br>because my enemy loses no time in plotting against me;
    <br>I should lose no time in committing myself to God.
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>Jesus said He will come like a thief in the night. No one knows the hour or time.
    <br>Why should you now say there is a certain time for prayer for you?
    <br>Are you in that business now?
    <br>That is it. That is the way out - consistency in prayer.
    <br>Your consistency in prayer and faithfulness is the only way out.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on! Give here. You can go.
    <br>Healed Of Difficulty In Walking
    <br>No Longer Using Walking Aid & Lumbar Corset
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. We are healed. Thank You, Jesus. We are healed. My God, thank You.
    <br>Prayer without ceasing. Because your enemy loses no time in plotting against you;
    <br>you should lose no time in committing yourself to God.
    <br>A break in prayer will mean a break in faith,
    <br>and a break in faith is a break with God.
    <br>Are you in that business now?
    <br>That is the way. You have discovered yourself today.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I have discovered myself today.
    <br>No enemy can fashion anything against you. When they come, you are there already.
    <br>You have discovered yourself.
    <br>Continue. That is the way out.
    <br>As you continue, very soon - I am not God; I am a servant of God - the Lord will intervene,
    <br>and you will now begin to switch from praises to prayer.
    <br>He will now take control of prayer. You are the one praying, not the Spirit.
    <br>The Spirit should pray, but now you are the one praying.
    <br>You will just see yourself praising God, switching to prayer -  like your blood flows.
    <br>That is the way it should be.
    <br>So, see me now. I am constantly praying in my heart.
    <br>If I now pray for the sick, they are delivered.
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>"Be delivered!". You continue to disturb your neighbour with prayer, "What kind of Pharisee is this?".
    <br>You continue opening the window. You say, "Ok, those who say I should not sleep today, they will die. Die!".
    <br>Do you need to tell them they will die? You want to inform them they will die.
    <br>"Well ok. Catch them".
    <br>So, please.
    <br>Build your temple.
    <br>A believer's heart is a prayer room.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: A believer's heart is a prayer room.
    <br>A believer's heart is a prayer room.
    <br>Your heart is the prayer room
    <br>and if your heart is the prayer room, it means that your heart is the altar.
    <br>It means your heart is a temple.
    <br>You are to get it prepared, neat.
    <br>But your heart is dirty.
    <br>And what makes it dirty?
    <br>Conflict between flesh and Spirit.
    <br>Division - "No, this one is not right". "It's right".
    <br>There is so much division in your heart.
    <br>You are to flush this out.
    <br>Jesus is the landlord, not tenant.
    <br>But now, in this case, you have made Jesus a tenant because of the conflict in your heart:
    <br>for satan / against Jesus; for Jesus / against satan,
    <br>flesh, for satan / Spirit, for God.
    <br>You have made Jesus a tenant, instead of the landlord.
    <br>There is no way.
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>- Did you listen to me?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Did you listen to me? You have complained already. Forget about complaining now.
    <br>I'm talking of maintenance. Ok?
    <br>This is a blessing for bringing you here so that you know more about God.
    <br>This situation now should strengthen your desire and determination for God.
    <br>What is going on in your heart?
    <br>I'm meditating.
    <br>You are meditating. Can you tell me what you are meditating on?
    <br>- How God will locate me.
    <br>- Uh.
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>If God is not locating you, what will happen?
    <br>I know He will locate me.
    <br>We are talking of God's character, and you are talking of location.
    <br>WHERE DOES THE POWER COME FROM?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Explains Healing
    <br>- You need to go to the River Jordan.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>I said, you need to go to the River Jordan.
    <br>- I say 'Amen'.
    <br>- So that we can soak you well.
    <br>This woman needs to go to the River Jordan.
    <br>We will take you there and you will spend two days there because it is too much on you.
    <br>- I said it is too much on you.
    <br>- Yes, it is too much.
    <br>Raise your legs. Let's go to the River Jordan.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Leave her.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You can just see.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>She's trying to trace her way.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I'm very fine. Thank You, Jesus. Oh God, thank You. Thank You, God, Jesus.
    <br>I love You, Jesus. Thank You.
    <br>Because He has located you.
    <br>You love Jesus because He has located you.
    <br>I hope you will not lose your blessing.
    <br>Without God's character, you will go nowhere with this blessing.
    <br>I can see now. I can see. I'm delivered. Thank You, Jesus. And I can walk.
    <br>- You can see now?
    <br>- I can see and I can walk. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Which one?
    <br>All of them. I can do it.
    <br>- You can do what?
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>- You can do what?
    <br>- I can walk and I can see.
    <br>Why can't you choose one? Which one will you choose now - to see or to walk?
    <br>I want two of them, man of God. I want all of them, man of God. I want both.
    <br>Because you do not deserve the two, but one. Take one and come back next time.
    <br>Ask momma. Momma, you will take one now and come back next time to take another one.
    <br>It is seeing or what?
    <br>I am already delivered, man of God. Thank you, man of God.
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>- She refuses to answer me.
    <br>So, you should now give your life ... This 'party'... I mean, you should do more of God. Ok?
    <br>- Ok, man of God.
    <br>- God loves you.
