  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>wherever you are does not matter but the position of your heart.
    <br>Wherever you are does not matter but the position of your heart
    <br>because your heart is the prayer room.
    <br>My heart is the prayer room.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>My heart is the prayer room.
    <br>Wherever you are does not matter but the position of your heart.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Jesus loves you - receive this.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever spirit that has been tormenting you - out!
    <br>Are you in bondage; are you in prison?
    <br>Are you a captive of affliction?
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Receive your freedom for salvation of your soul!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough!
