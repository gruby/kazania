    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says: The prayers offered on Emmanuel TV are not time-bound.
    <br>Anytime you hear them, the presence of God is maintained.
    <br>Be blessed as you listen to this testimony
    <br>from a Togolese international footballer who discovered this reality in his own life.
    <br>There is never a sickness Jesus cannot cure, even the deadly virus COVID-19.
    <br>My name is Dove Abotchi; I am a Togolese international, I play for the Togo National Team.
    <br>I'm in South Africa playing for a football team here but I used to represent Togo in international competitions.
    <br>Unfortunately, I was tested positive for COVID-19.
    <br>It was a difficult situation for me and also for my teammates.
    <br>We were three who tested positive for COVID-19
    <br>so they quarantined us and we had to stay isolated for 14 days.
    <br>In my self-isolation time, it was tough;
    <br>I was coughing, sneezing and had a high fever.
    <br>I could not breathe properly.
    <br>It was very tough.
    <br>During our 14 days of quarantine, as I was following Emmanuel TV,
    <br>I saw that people used to call from all over the world who had been tested positive
    <br>and the ministers of God prayed for them and they were healed.
    <br>I know that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua used to say that distance is not a barrier;
    <br>God is a Spirit.
    <br>On a Saturday morning, T.B. Joshua was preaching on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>After the preaching, he started praying for the viewers.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>we say every shame the evil spirit has caused you - be it in your health -
    <br>be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every shame the evil spirit has caused you in your health, blood, fluids -
    <br>we remove that affliction, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That affliction - leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I told myself, "This is the right time for me to get healed."
    <br>So I knelt down as he was praying for viewers and touched the screen.
    <br>During the prayer, it felt like I was no longer there and I experienced heat in my body.
    <br>I was sweating.
    <br>After the prayer, I tried to do what I was not able to do before -
    <br>like breathing, talking quickly, doing something strenuous.
    <br>So, I breathed and realised there was nothing wrong - I was normal.
    <br>I went out and walked quickly and did something fast
    <br>so that I could observe my breathing and nothing was wrong - it was normal!
    <br>Then I shouted!
    <br>I went back home and started thanking God and singing.
    <br>It was on Saturday I prayed with T.B. Joshua - that time it was not live.
    <br>Viewers, those on the sickbed, I release you from that bed of sickness!
    <br>Be released from that bed of sickness!
    <br>Be released from that bed of sickness, affliction, disease!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>T.B. Joshua said, "This prayer is not time-bound;
    <br>whenever you see this prayer and receive it, you will be healed."
    <br>I had to go back on Monday to redo the test.
    <br>I stood on this word and I received the result of the second test and it was negative!
    <br>I have to thank God for His glory and for everything He has done for me.
    <br>I'm completely healed! I started running and doing my professional training.
    <br>I started doing everything that I was doing before.
    <br>So, I have to thank God for everything He has done for me.
    <br>For those people who are in the same situation, it is not the end of the world; don't panic!
    <br>God uses everything for His name to be glorified!
    <br>So, as a Christian, don't panic.
    <br>Just have faith and keep praying and following T.B. Joshua's ministry because it is powerful!
    <br>I thank God for everything!
    <br>Thank God. Today, I'm free! I can do whatever I want!
    <br>I'm doing professional training! I'm free!
    <br>I thank God for everything He has done for me!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says: The prayers offered on Emmanuel TV are not time-bound.
    <br>Anytime you hear them, the presence of God is maintained.
    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>Good Christians are good citizens.
    <br>This video does not discourage anyone from seeking medical treatment.
    <br>The tablet, the medicine the doctor has given you -
    <br>If you don't believe in God with medicine, you cannot believe in God without medicine.
