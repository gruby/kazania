  <p>    
    <br>There's a woman there.
    <br>I know, it will look embarrassing; this marriage is about to collapse.
    <br>The marriage is about to collapse because of an accusation. Come out.
    <br>Your husband is here. I think this is threatening your marriage.
    <br>In response the prophecy of a couple having a problem in their marriage,
    <br>these two come forward to meet the man of God.
    <br>I said, there is a conflict between husband and wife that is here.
    <br>Yes, it is us, sir. That is why we are here.
    <br>It is not the fault of your wife.
    <br>There is an evil spirit that is tormenting this woman.
    <br>This is your wife.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>What I am about to say is nothing - I will not be able to say it here
    <br>because your wife embarrassed you.
    <br>Yes, Man of God. It is true, Man of God.
    <br>People you are giving money - they are embarrassing you.
    <br>It's true, Man of God.
    <br>Don't worry.
    <br>Help us, Man of God!
    <br>She came from London two days ago just because of this issue.
    <br>Look, if you believe you are a beautiful lady and you are selling your beauty,
    <br>you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>Listen, this is your husband. If you leave this man - oh my God, forget about your beauty.
    <br>I know you have a spirit that is tormenting you to do what you are doing.
    <br>You have wronged him.
    <br>I have wronged him.
    <br>Did you listen to that? She said, inside her, she knows she has wronged you and she is sorry.
    <br>She will be delivered. Ok?
    <br>I am happy that you said this.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Whatever threat - the threat to leave the marriage or whatever, put it behind you,
    <br>there is nothing like that.
    <br>That should be the reason why you should love her.
    <br>What happened to you should be the reason why you should love this man.
    <br>What happened to this lady should be the reason why you should love her the more.
    <br>And tell those people, "Now I'm loving my wife more than ever before."
    <br>Shame off you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you so much!
    <br>Thank you, Man of God!
    <br>The man of God met with the couple after the service to pray for their deliverance.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the couple, delivering them both in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Lucky Egharevba.
    <br>I am a Nigerian, residing in the UK, and the good lady standing beside me is my wife.
    <br>She is Clara Egharevba.
    <br>Sir, tell us the word of prophecy that you received with your wife last week.
    <br>Yes, I can confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>The man of God was spot on because that was the reason why we actually came for the deliverance.
    <br>It is true because some time ago, my wife actually confided in me
    <br>to let me know that she has been attacked with the spirit of lust.
    <br>By so doing, I felt a bit so disturbed, knowing the kind of level we were in, in the UK.
    <br>That's actually why we came here. It has not been so easy coming here.
    <br>It has been taking me about two years, praying, fasting to make sure she comes here
    <br>to get herself delivered from this spirit of lust that has actually destroyed our marriage.
    <br>Ok, sir. Can you explain how long you've known her, how long you been married
    <br>and how this spirit of lust in the life of your wife really affected the marriage
    <br>and how you found out about this.
    <br>The spirit of lust has affected our marriage.
    <br>We have been together for over 20 years because our first son is 19 years now.
    <br>And 10 years ago, we celebrated our marriage and it was like a carnival,
    <br>very big in Benin - we came to celebrate our marriage.
    <br>But after the marriage celebration, the business that we were doing very very well,
    <br>we began to notice some galloping in the business and we didn't really know what was happening.
    <br>Whilst this was going on, from nowhere, I just packed my load from London
    <br>and I came to Nigeria for no reason. I didn't even know.
    <br>And I left a multi million business back in England.
    <br>While I was in Nigeria, I now diverted into something I didn't even know anything about.
    <br>I believe that this spirit was also tormenting me too
    <br>because I was now doing a bar business, completely different from what I even know.
    <br>Whilst I was Nigeria, I began to hear some rumours about my wife.
    <br>But because I have never believed in third parties coming into our marriage,
    <br>I have always ignored it.
    <br>So this kept on going.
    <br>Then whilst I was in Nigeria, my wife would also often come to Nigeria.
    <br>Every year, sometimes twice a year.
    <br>So it kept on going like that.
    <br>There was a day when I was about to see her off to the airport,
    <br>I noticed she was too glued to her mobile phone.
    <br>Then something just told me, "Can I have the mobile phone?"
    <br>When I got hold of the mobile phone, I discovered a whole lot of text messages
    <br>that were not really godly and friendly.
    <br>That was how I got to know that, "Oh, this rumour that I was hearing about, it's all true".
    <br>So I now said to her, "Let's see if we can make things work out".
    <br>I now invited her; she travelled back out that very day.
    <br>I now invited her to come back to Nigeria almost immediately so we could talk about it.
    <br>Then we did talk about it and I said, "Ok, try as much as you can".
    <br>But she also made me to understand that it was not her.
    <br>When the spirit came upon her, she could not handle it.
    <br>I understood it.
    <br>But because of also the preaching of the man of God who always says,
    <br>"Don't reject people because of their weakness" - I held on to that.
    <br>I kept on supporting her, praying and fasting to make sure a day like this actually comes to pass
    <br>where we can be standing and testifying for the glory of God and shame unto the devil.
    <br>That is actually why we are here.
    <br>Ok, sir. So you heard these rumours whilst you were in Nigeria and she was in the UK
    <br>and later when you discovered the various text messages on her phone, you confronted her.
    <br>Did she actually open up and admit that this was what was happening and
    <br>who were the caliber of people that she found herself meeting?
    <br>Yes. Going back to the prophecy of the man of God - that is where that one comes in.
    <br>Yes, when that happened, she admitted and confessed to me,
    <br>"Oh, this is exactly what the issue is".
    <br>The embarrassment that the man of God said, that was during the confession
    <br>when she was now telling me, mentioning names, I just discovered they were all the people,
    <br>even sometimes people that were even working under me which was really not too good at all.
    <br>That was actually where the embarrassment the man of God talked about comes in
    <br>and I confirm that to be true.
    <br>This is in confirmation of the prophecy that your wife's behaviour in the UK
    <br>really caused embarrassment to you because the people she was involved with
    <br>were people that were working for you or people that saw you as father figures, elderly people.
    <br>These were actually the people that she had an encounter with because of that spirit of lust.
    <br>Yes, that's correct.
    <br>Ok, and the man of God said that the marriage was literally on the point of collapsing
    <br>if not that the prophecy came forth.
    <br>What can you say about that, sir?
    <br>I can confirm that to be true because some time last year,
    <br>there is this my little cousin's daughter that my wife went to the house and
    <br>she gave the little girl her phone to help her to type a message.
    <br>That my cousin always tells her daughter that auntie is our brother's wife.
    <br>So after the little girl typed the message, she went back to her mother,
    <br>"Mummy, isn't it you said auntie is your brother's wife?" Her mummy said, "Yes".
    <br>Then the mummy said, "Why did you ask?"
    <br>She now said that the message she typed that auntie said she should help her to type was to a man.
    <br>Then that cousin called me.
    <br>So I felt disturbed. I said, "Ah, not again. Not after what we have gone through".
    <br>Then I also invited her to come and after, there was a little bit of argument
    <br>but she also let me know, "Oh yes, something went wrong".
    <br>I then said, "This time, it's either you come to The SCOAN for your deliverance
    <br>or the marriage has to stop. I am not going further without deliverance".
    <br>That was exactly how we finally came here.
    <br>Ok, so this was a situation this couple was in.
    <br>They had come to a point where they were about to separate
    <br>unless there was an agreement to come to The SCOAN for deliverance.
    <br>To the glory of God, sir, last week the Prophet located your case in a prophecy,
    <br>counselled you and then prayed for you and your wife.
    <br>Can you just tell us - since the deliverance that you and your wife received last week,
    <br>what are the changes you have witnessed to the glory of God?
    <br>Oh, I can confirm it's been so beautiful since the prayer from the man of God.
    <br>My wife is totally a new person. She is so different.
    <br>She is always saying, "I'm so light". It's like something left her.
    <br>She is actually a different person.
    <br>And I must say to you, I love her even more than I have always loved her.
    <br>I give all the glory to God. I say, "Thank You, Jesus, for this deliverance".
    <br>Amen let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>That is the power of deliverance in that word of prophecy.
    <br>So you mean to say now, sir, that there's no more thought in your heart of leaving your wife;
    <br>you're now with her and you know that that spirit of lust has left her completely.
    <br>Not at all. I have no thought of leaving her.
    <br>If it's possible, I want to marry her again and again and again.
    <br>I just love her.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty. We thank Jesus Christ for what He has done in this marriage.
    <br>We just want to hear a quick word from your wife as well before listening to your advice, sir.
    <br>Madam, you are welcome, in Jesus' name. Just introduce yourself to us
    <br>and tell us how you can confirm the prophecy of the man of God to be true.
    <br>Good Morning, everybody.
    <br>My name is Clara Egharevba.
    <br>Everything my husband said about me is true
    <br>and the word of prophecy of the man of God is true.
    <br>So, how can you confirm that prophecy to be true?
    <br>Just explain how this prophecy is true for your life.
    <br>It started when I was a little girl.
    <br>I remember my mother always told me that when I was sleeping and dreaming, I would say a lot of words
    <br>and sometimes, they would get a paper and write it down.
    <br>My late father always said, "Oh, my prophetess starts talking".
    <br>Even sometimes, they told me that when I was sleeping, I would talk.
    <br>I noticed that if I wanted something now, and I said I wanted something, I would get it.
    <br>So the thing was always pushing me.
    <br>When he left London, I was mixing with bad friends.
    <br>When we were together, I didn't even know - I have lived in London for 30 years -
    <br>I didn't even know anywhere in London - just me and him like that.
    <br>But the influence of my friends added to my spiritual husband that was tormenting me.
    <br>But now, I'm so happy that I am delivered from it.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Thank you, Man of God, for saving me.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ
    <br>We have heard it from our sister. She said that when her husband left -
    <br>strangely, he just suddenly left the UK to come to Nigeria despite his businesses there -
    <br>at that moment she was having the influence of bad friends.
    <br>Tell us, sister, what did that influence lead you to do -
    <br>the influence of these bad friends you were moving with?
    <br>A lot of things - going out, thinking out of wedlock, not concentrating on my husband.
    <br>Even sometimes when my husband called me, I wouldn't concentrate on him.
    <br>It made me to hate him; to feel that, "Oh, I have lived in the darkness, this man is not for me".
    <br>A lot of things.
    <br>And when that spirit of lust came upon you, you would not be able to control yourself at that point.
    <br>Yes, I wouldn't know. It was like when somebody gets drunk. You don't know what you are doing.
    <br>You think you're doing the right thing at that time.
    <br>We thank God that last week, you came to The SCOAN,
    <br>received that prophecy and the man of God prayed for you.
    <br>Just tell us what happened to you when the man of God prayed for you.
    <br>When I saw him, I was scared.
    <br>Then when he prayed for me, I felt something strange leaving my body immediately.
    <br>So when you people took me back, I said, "Oh God".
    <br>And on top of that, as far as I'm in this building, I know I have already been delivered.
    <br>You mean to say that since that prayer, you felt something leave you
    <br>and ever since then, what are the changes in your life and your marriage?
    <br>I'll be thinking differently.
    <br>It's like I just married my husband newly; the first love I have for him.
    <br>It's like I have just renewed it again.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God, for delivering from the spirit of lust.
    <br>Thank you so much. God bless you.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We give all the glory to God for what He has done in the life of this couple.
    <br>Madam, what is your word of advice to our viewers around the world,
    <br>with what Jesus has done for you?
    <br>It's just to believe in God and if you have any problem, don't hide it from God.
    <br>Don't listen to people; just come straight to a living church and be delivered and have trust.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ. Finally let's just hear a word of advice from our brother as well
    <br>to cap off this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Sir, what is your word of advice especially to married couples
    <br>that may be facing a challenge that you and your wife once faced before you came here?
    <br>My advice to couples who are also in the state we were in the past:
    <br>Stand by your loved one because this spirit that is tormenting,
    <br>making someone to do what they're not supposed to do,
    <br>it's not really the person; it is the spirit behind it.
    <br>So I would advise couples to key into that word:
    <br>Don't reject someone because of their weakness, rather see how you can assist them, out of faith.
    <br>When you have any problem, don't run from God, run to God
    <br>and come and get your deliverance; look for any living church and get delivered.
    <br>And the same God that located us will also locate you for the glory of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God for this marriage.
    <br>We pray that God will give you both the grace to make the Word of God the standard for your home
    <br>and we believe that as you do so, you are going to come back
    <br>with more wonderful testimonies, in Jesus' name.
