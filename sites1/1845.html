    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Harry Wolthuizen, I am 51 years old.
    <br>I come from Belgium and I am part of the leadership team at our church.
    <br>What is the problem that has brought you to The Synagogue?
    <br>I have epilepsy.
    <br>After a brain scan was done, I was not allowed in the military, due to the epilepsy.
    <br>The doctors said that I couldn't handle stress.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>The doctors said that when I lie down on my left side, I will experience blackouts.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>I've had three serious car accidents due to these epileptic attacks.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>As a result of the first accident, I spent about six and a half months in hospital.
    <br>I also have a bent finger as a result of these accidents.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>What do you hope that the Lord will do for you here in The Synagogue?
    <br>I believe that God will heal me of epilepsy and change my understanding of His greatness and goodness.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>The epilepsy is now being commanded out of Mr Harry Wolthuizen.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, out!
    <br>A believer is one who believes what it takes to cast out satan.
    <br>Out!
    <br>The spirit of epilepsy, out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The spirit of deaf and dumb, out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is using the authority in the mighty name of Jesus Christ to command out
    <br>the spirit of epilepsy that has been tormenting this man for the past 41 years.
    <br>Mr Harry has fallen to the floor under the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Right now, God is commanding something out, He is moving something out of his spirit, soul and body
    <br>and He is replacing it with new life.
    <br>I'm not trying to be hard on you but on the one inside that caused the epileptic sickness.
    <br>After four years, Harry Wolthuizen came back to The SCOAN to testify to the goodness of God.
    <br>Ever since the prayer of the man of God, T.B. Joshua, he has been completely free from all epileptic attacks.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Praise the Lord! You're welcome to The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you please introduce yourself for us?
    <br>My name is Harry Wolthuizen.
    <br>What is your age and the country you are coming from?
    <br>I am 54 years old and I live in Belgium.
    <br>What is the problem that brought you to The Synagogue?
    <br>I came here at the suggestion of my Pastor, with the problem of epilepsy.
    <br>For how long had you been suffering with the problem of epilepsy?
    <br>I had epilepsy from birth; it was a curse in the family.
    <br>My aunt died as a result of an epileptic attack.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>How did the epilepsy affect your own life and your everyday activities?
    <br>I was not allowed to swim or to drive.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>Did you suffer any attacks, any seizures as a result of the epilepsy?
    <br>The worst thing that happened was that I once had eight seizures in one day.
    <br>It was a terrible day.
    <br>I had a serious car accident in June 2000 on a highway close to the city of Antwerp in Belgium.
    <br>My car bounced back over six lanes.
    <br>The doctors were very worried and first thought it was a heart attack
    <br>but later they discovered that the accident was caused by the epilepsy.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>We can see that this was a very serious disease in your life.
    <br>Was there any other job that you could not perform because of the epilepsy?
    <br>I felt very weak and would fall asleep at the most important moments,
    <br>for example, when I was at the wheel of the car.
    <br>I felt irritated, angry and frustrated.
    <br>It was not easy for people to be around me, especially my wife and children.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>We see a medical report with you; can you please explain this report for us?
    <br>This document is the report from the military service in Holland.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>They called him to military service at a certain age;
    <br>they did a medical check-up and because of the epilepsy and the abnormal EEG (brain activity),
    <br>they could not use him and did not want him to be in the military service.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>We see another medical report with you; can you please explain it in further detail for us?
    <br>This is in the middle of the medical report.
    <br>You can see the word 'epilepsy' on this medical report, and his name.
    <br>This is the most important thing.
    <br>We see that you came to The SCOAN and stood in the prayer line
    <br>and received prayer from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What was your experience as the man of God was praying for you?
    <br>I was afraid that I might fall down, so I spread out my legs in order to stand firmly on the ground.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>I thought that considering my weight, T.B. Joshua would not be able to get me to the floor.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua stretched his hand and I felt the power of God and fell down.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>How did you feel immediately after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>I was so happy; I can't describe it.
    <br>I danced almost the whole night.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>After the prayer, how are your life, your everyday activities, your mental state? How are you?
    <br>Many things have changed and the most important thing is that my character has changed.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>Amen, hallelujah!
    <br>I know now that the evil spirit had distorted my character.
    <br>Now, I am happy; I experience the liberty of God.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>Praise the Lord! Have you gone back to the doctors since you have been healed?
    <br>When I returned home, I told my children, my wife and the people in the office that I was healed!
    <br>I went to the hospital for a brain scan and an examination.
    <br>The doctor said he did not believe I had ever had epilepsy; everything was normal.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>Amen, let's clap for Jesus!
    <br>This is the report from the doctor in Belgium after the healing
    <br>showing that I don't have epilepsy any longer.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
    <br>In this medical report, the doctor says that the epilepsy started from the age of around seven,
    <br>and that it was a problem from the father's side of the family.
    <br>The brain scan says that the brain is now "well structured".
    <br>On another page, the report states that he has normal brain activity
    <br>and that the electric waves are now within the normal limits, unlike patients with epilepsy.
    <br>Praise the Lord. So, before you came to The Synagogue, the doctors confirmed you to have epilepsy.
    <br>But after the prayer of the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, you went back to the doctors
    <br>and the doctors confirmed you to be free from the problem of epilepsy. Is this correct?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Amen, let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You received your healing in the year 2000 and this is the year 2004.
    <br>So, for the last four years you have been completely free of the problem of epilepsy.
    <br>We thank God for the healing He has performed in your life.
    <br>Now that you have been healed, what is your promise to God Almighty?
    <br>My promise to God is to serve Him with my whole heart and to go and sin no more.
    <br>TB JOSHUA CASTS OUT SPIRIT OF EPILEPSY!!!
