    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to take you up on a special issue today.
    <br>I realised people don’t give anymore.
    <br>When you meet people today, they will say they have nothing or little.
    <br>Giving reshapes our destiny.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Giving reshapes our destiny.
    <br>When you give with all your heart, not giving for selfish, classical or material reasons,
    <br>it is reshaping your destiny.
    <br>People don't give today.
    <br>They say, "I don't have. I have little for my family. It is difficult for me to share, to part with it."
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>We take our reading from the Book of Luke 16.
    <br>“Jesus told his disciples: ‘There was a rich man
    <br>whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions'".
    <br>I'm taking reading from verse 1.
    <br>"'So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you?
    <br>Give an account of your management because you cannot be manager any longer.’"
    <br>That is a boss speaking to his staff.
    <br>“’The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now?’”
    <br>Let's go to the proof text - verse 10.
    <br>“Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much,
    <br>and whoever is dishonest with little will also be dishonest with much."
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>“So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?
    <br>And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property,
    <br>who will give you property of your own?”
    <br>Take your time to read 1 Corinthians 14:16,
    <br>and the Book of Mark 12:42-44
    <br>and the Book of Matthew 25:22-24.
    <br>Here we are today with numerous challenges – stagnation, career failure, affliction – just name it.
    <br>Glory be to God – there is hope.
    <br>The same God who was with us yesterday will be with us today.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The same God who was with us yesterday will be with us today.
    <br>That is hope.
    <br>The same God who was with us yesterday will be with us today.
    <br>That is hope.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There is hope".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>There is hope.
    <br>The same God who was with us yesterday will be with us today.
    <br>That is hope.
    <br>This is why you should be calm.
    <br>There is no need of worrying yourself; leave it for God.
    <br>From the Book of Mark 12:42-44
    <br>and the Book of Matthew 25:22-24, which I have given you,
    <br>and 1 Corinthians 14:16.
    <br>GOD CARES ABOUT LITTLE
    <br>We are in the season of little.
    <br>No matter what you have.
    <br>The richest man in the world today will tell you that the things are little; it is not as it was before.
    <br>Businesses are becoming little, your income is becoming little, your strength - also the same.
    <br>Many people - from 3 bedrooms to 2 bedrooms.
    <br>Many begin to sell some of their property to still stand for the future.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “We are in the season of little”.
    <br>It is a season.
    <br>Time for everything.
    <br>You may say it is an attack - no, it is not an attack, it is a season, it is everywhere.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “God cares about little”.
    <br>One thing we must know today – we all believe that we can only give out of abundance.
    <br>Because we are used to giving only what we do not need,
    <br>what we have used, the left-over in our store or garage.
    <br>Somebody runs to you, "Please, help me!"
    <br>Instead of giving something you need, something your life depends on, something you cherish,
    <br>you open your store and give something you have used, something you do not need,
    <br>the left-over from your store.
    <br>You open your store and say, "This is a good tyre for you".
    <br>If it is a good tyre for you, why is it not good for you?
    <br>The left-over in our store; we are used to that.
    <br>Think back - what we have been giving to people.
    <br>They cherish it because they have no choice.
    <br>Whatever we give out of little, it means a lot to us because it attracts God’s attention.
    <br>This is why Jesus was watching the poor widow – because He cares about little.
    <br>He was watching the poor widow, while other rich people were going.
    <br>He was looking at the poorest woman among the crowd to see how much,
    <br>how she would part out of that little.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Whatever you give out of little, it means a lot to you because it attracts God’s attention.
    <br>If you don’t know how much you need God in the small things,
    <br>you cannot know how much you need God in the big things
    <br>because everything big starts little.
    <br>If something big starts big, it calls for concern.
    <br>How many of us here can tell me how much you need God to sit down or to stand up?
    <br>You don't need God to sit down because you can sit down.
    <br>No single person can tell me they rely on God’s strength to sit down.
    <br>No one can tell me he or she relies on God to stand up.
    <br>You want to stand up, you meditate in your heart, "In Jesus' name..."
    <br>You want to sit down, "In Jesus' name..." -
    <br>you can't do that!
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>If you don’t know how much you need God in the small things,
    <br>you cannot know how much you need Him in the big things.
    <br>This is why your relationship is in shambles.
    <br>There is cause for concern in your relationship with God
    <br>because you don’t know how much you need God.
    <br>Even to close your eyes, you need God.
    <br>To comb your hair, you need God.
    <br>To eat, you need God.
    <br>To dress up, you need God.
    <br>To walk, you need God.
    <br>To talk, you need God but you ignore that, do that on your own
    <br>because you believe you don’t need God to do all those things
    <br>but you only need God for your situation – to help you, heal you, prosper you.
    <br>This is just it.
    <br>If you don’t know how much you need God in the small things
    <br>such as to talk, look, walk, dress up, comb your hair or greet,
    <br>you will not know how much you need God to settle your situation.
    <br>Don’t forget you were once an embryo in your mother’s womb.
    <br>See what you have become today.
    <br>If you ignore your young, definitely you will ignore your old.
    <br>Please, pray without ceasing.
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart – in hymns, spiritual songs and making melodies in your heart.
    <br>Are you doing that now?
    <br>Are you in that business now, or you are just looking at me?
    <br>If you are just looking at me, your heart will be telling you a different thing.
    <br>While you are looking at me, it would be telling you, "Don't mind the man; it is difficult to do.
    <br>OK, anyway, God will help me."
    <br>Your heart will be saying different things, while you are looking at me.
    <br>You must get hold of your heart; control your heart.
    <br>When you are able to control your heart, then you will know how much you need God in small things.
    <br>When you want to stand; if you are in the meditation business -
    <br>if you want to stand, you say, "In Jesus' name. Thank You."
    <br>You are going, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You want to stop, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You want to greet, "Thank You, Jesus"
    <br>Because you are into that in your heart.
    <br>In the Book of Matthew 25:22-24,
    <br>God is constantly putting us to the test in the small things.
    <br>If we fail to bless others with the little God has given us, we may never grow.
    <br>That is why some of us remain in the same position.
    <br>If you don’t know how much you need God in the small things such as to walk, talk, stand or sit,
    <br>you will continue to have certain occasions for prayer.
    <br>That is why you have certain occasions..., "3 o'clock - I need to break my fasting, I need to go and pray."
    <br>Why a certain occasion for prayer?
    <br>This is why satan keeps getting that opportunity to get you.
    <br>The Bible says a break in prayer is a break in faith and a break is faith is a break with God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>A break in prayer is a break in faith; a break in faith is a break with God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again,
    <br>A break in prayer is a break in faith; a break in faith is a break with God.
    <br>Certain occasions for prayer is a break with God.
    <br>The little time you have a break with God, satan gets you.
    <br>When you know how much you need God, you will pray without ceasing – pray continuously.
    <br>Prayer is the key
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Jesus started with prayer and ended with prayer
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>That is all.
    <br>Jesus started here and ended here;
    <br>He started with prayer, all throughout, and ended with prayer.
    <br>Why certain occasion for prayer?
    <br>Why is your life different from Jesus’ life?
    <br>He is our role model.
    <br>He started with prayer and ended with prayer but it seems you have certain occasions for prayer
    <br>because you don’t know how much you need Him in the small things.
    <br>Prayer is the key
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Jesus started with prayer and ended with prayer
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Can you see why you are very accessible to satan?
    <br>He can get you anytime and he can drop you anytime.
    <br>He knows how to get you.
    <br>He knows when you are not with God.
    <br>He knows when you have a break with God.
    <br>Each time you have a break with God, he gets you.
    <br>Are you in the business of prayer right now?
    <br>Each time you have a break, you drop the master key to loose and bind.
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart.
    <br>Why in my heart?
    <br>Because your heart is the communication point, contact point.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>If Jesus is coming to you, it is to your heart.
    <br>It is the landing point.
    <br>He will land before talking to you.
    <br>You don't hear the voice of God here.
    <br>Someone will say, "I can hear this; God says this, that" - no, God doesn't say here.
    <br>Here, our heart - contact point, communication point.
    <br>Our heart is the prayer room; our heart is the altar.
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart in hymns and spiritual songs.
    <br>What is a hymn?
    <br>I have given you; you have hymns, songs...
    <br>All the way to Calvary He went for me...
    <br>In your heart.
    <br>If your heart is talking, your lips should not move.
    <br>Keep busy with that - there are many songs for you.
    <br>You drop that after a while, "Locate me in Your mercy, Lord" - in your heart.
    <br>After a while you drop that, say "Take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>This is the route to God, the channel to God.
    <br>Your contribution to others – see it as an assignment from God.
    <br>Whatever you give, see it as an assignment from God.
    <br>Whatever you do, "Excuse me, can I help you? OK, thank you" - see it as an assignment from God.
    <br>Failing them is failing God.
    <br>When you see it as an assignment from God, you will not wait to receive reward.
    <br>Tomorrow you meet the person you helped, you will now begin to say, "Look at this woman I helped;
    <br>she didn't even greet me - see her. Madam, you don't know me?
    <br>I was the one who helped you yesterday. You can't even say 'thank you.'"
    <br>If it was an assignment from God, you would not wait for the reward.
    <br>See it as an assignment from God.
    <br>Once you do that, God will reward you; God is the Rewarder.
    <br>God is so much concerned about little.
    <br>That is why He was watching the poor widow.
    <br>God is so much concerned about your little possessions.
    <br>He wants you to grow.
    <br>How can you grow when you are not part with others?
    <br>Whatever you give out of little, it means so much.
    <br>It is easy to part with little than much.
    <br>The rich cannot give what their life depends on
    <br>but the poor give what their life depends on, no matter how little.
    <br>So, there is no excuse now that you have little – that is the best time to give.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>little...
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>You have little?
    <br>God is so much concerned about your little possessions because He wants you to grow.
    <br>When you part with little, consider it as an assignment from God.
    <br>Don’t accept someone coming to you to thank you; it will affect your gift.
    <br>Someone would say, "Thank you very much for what you have given me yesterday" -
    <br>it will affect what you have given him.
    <br>If somebody comes to you and says, "I want to thank you
    <br>for what you have given me yesterday - it really helped",
    <br>"Ha! I want to thank you for receiving it."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because you are reshaping your destiny.
    <br>Thanking people after a gift is a "culture", it is a tradition, but spiritually, it has a comma.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to leave you here.
    <br>Thank you.
