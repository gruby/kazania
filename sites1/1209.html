  <p>    
    <br>Right now, begin to ask for the gift of eyes that see and ears that hear what Jesus is telling you.
    <br>Ask God to liberate your spirit.
    <br>Liberate my spirit.
    <br>Liberate my spirit, oh Lord.
    <br>Ears that hear what Jesus is telling me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>All those challenges are darkness.
    <br>Evil spirit is darkness.
    <br>Infirmity, setback, stagnation, sickness are darkness.
    <br>Say to yourself:
    <br>I will never forget the Light who liberated me when I come out of the darkness.
    <br>That infirmity is darkness; that evil spirit is darkness.
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You darkness in my life - right now, begin to separate yourself from that darkness.
    <br>Separate yourself from that darkness.
    <br>That infirmity is darkness; begin to separate yourself from that darkness!
    <br>I command all unclean spirits operating in your life - command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>All unclean spirits operating in your life, business, career - command them out!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>I command all unclean spirits operating in your life, career, marriage, business -
    <br>command them out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Vomiting Blood And Poisonous Substances
    <br>Watch the screen of your television.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Don't forget: Unclean spirit is sickness, stagnation, setback, failure, infirmity.
    <br>Right now, take note of that.
    <br>All unclean spirits operating in your life, career, health, marriage,
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomiting Blood And Poisonous Substances
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Command them out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Vomiting Blood And Poisonous Substances
    <br>You can see what is happening right now.
    <br>People are vomiting out the root cause of their problems
    <br>as the Spirit of God moves in the midst of the congregation
    <br>to expose all unclean spirits operating in the lives of the people -
    <br>the unclean spirits operating in their health, career, marriage, business
    <br>are being commanded out by the superior power of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Viewers around the world, join in the prayer and you too will be a partaker of this mighty anointing
    <br>as the Spirit of God is flushing people's systems and removing everything that is not from God in their lives.
    <br>We can see right here in the overflow congregation...
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever satan and his cohort might have used to connect you, to connect your business,
    <br>whatever chain, whatever medium used to connect you to himself -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to break it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Break it!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it sickness - break it!
    <br>Break the chain!
    <br>Whatever satan might have used - satan can use sickness to connect you to himself,
    <br>satan can use failure - by the time you are facing failure, he is somewhere laughing, happy
    <br>because he wants to see you unhappy, depressed.
    <br>Listen to me once again when I say,
    <br>"Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself".
    <br>Now, you begin to break that thing satan used -
    <br>those things satan is using to affect your joy.
    <br>You want to be happy.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to reason with yourself right now.
    <br>Reason with yourself - you will see what satan might have used.
    <br>You will see what satan is using to connect you to himself.
    <br>He wants you to be unhappy. He wants you to be sad.
    <br>He wants you to look at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>Reason with yourself - you will see what satan is using to connect you to himself.
    <br>It can be sickness, infirmity, stagnation, nightmares, loneliness or depression.
    <br>These are the tools of satan.
    <br>Whatever satan might have been using to connect you to himself -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You want to be happy but when this pain, affliction, challenge, situation comes,
    <br>it changes your joy.
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When Jesus says, "Yes", no one can say, "No".
    <br>I can hear chains falling!
    <br>Chain of setback - I can hear chains falling!
    <br>Chain of stagnation - I can hear chains falling!
    <br>Chain of failure - I can hear chains falling!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That chain of affliction is falling right now!
    <br>I can see them falling!
    <br>I can see them giving way, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>How much is your joy?
    <br>You will not leave here today without you being restored.
    <br>That your health - be examined, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your blood - be examined, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your kidneys - be examined, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your liver - be examined, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your bones - be examined, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You affliction - be ceased!
    <br>In the blood - be ceased!
    <br>In the kidneys - be ceased!
    <br>In the liver - be ceased!
    <br>Wherever it is located, you affliction -
    <br>in the blood, kidneys, bones -
    <br>you affliction - say, out!
    <br>Place your hand.
    <br>If you have loved ones somewhere, stretch your hand.
    <br>Place your hand wherever that affliction is.
    <br>Your loved one - stretch your hand forward.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Whatever hinders my healing - give way!
    <br>Whatever hinders my deliverance - give way!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever hinders your deliverance - give way!
    <br>Say, give way!
    <br>Be it your weakness, doubt - I say, give way!
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?

    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Don't forget your assignment - assignment from God.
    <br>Business of meditation.
    <br>At your level, we should not deceive ourselves.
    <br>Whom are you praying to?
    <br>Lay the foundation.
    <br>Our heart is divided; there is a conflict between the flesh and spirit.
    <br>Create room, a home for the Holy Ghost by meditation.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Right now, begin to constantly praise His holy name in your heart.
    <br>Pray, sing hymns, spiritual songs, melodies in your heart to the Lord, all the time; day and night.
    <br>That is the best prayer that will lead you to the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Now, you need a visit of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Invite Him.
    <br>You need to know the God you are talking to, you are praying to.
    <br>When you pray to God, you hear from Him.
    <br>It is two way.
    <br>- "Good Morning, Sir."
    <br>- "Good morning, my son."
    <br>But for so long, you keep praying and you don't hear from Him.
    <br>Each time you talk to Him, you must hear.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and say after me...
    <br>Remember our message today.
    <br>Not just confessing but believe.
    <br>Whatever you say right now, live by it.
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me Your channel, Your channel of love where there is hate.
    <br>Make me Your channel - Your channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Make me Your channel - Your channel of forgiveness where there is sin, wrong or mistake.
    <br>Make me Your channel of forgiveness.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me Your channel of pardon where there is injury.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Mrs Eze Juilet. I'm from Enugu State (Nigeria).
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was booked for an operation
    <br>due to the cord that was wrapped around my baby's neck.
    <br>I was not able to deliver my baby without an operation because of the cord.
    <br>During the Mass Prayer, I was in the Overflow Section of the Church.
    <br>When the man of God was praying, I fell into labour and my water burst.
    <br>They rushed to help me and I delivered my baby successfully without any operation.
    <br>Hallelujah! Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Glory be to God. So you have heard it from the woman
    <br>that she delivered her baby instantly without any operation.
    <br>Madam, can you tell us the sex of your baby?
    <br>He's a bouncing baby boy.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Could you introduce to us the man sitting beside you, madam?
    <br>He's my lovely husband.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>All I have to say is "Thank You, Jesus" because it was a long journey.
    <br>This baby had been giving signs to come out but no way.
    <br>During the Mass Prayer, I was upstairs praying.
    <br>Even my prayer request, I wrote about her alone - her name alone.
    <br>I said, "God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, you have been doing it for others.
    <br>My own will never be different".
    <br>So I was surprised, during the Mass Prayer, I glanced to the TV.
    <br>I now saw her clothes.
    <br>I was amazed and said, "Is it not my wife?"
    <br>I was shocked; I screamed.
    <br>I told everyone around me, "She is my wife!"
    <br>And how do you feel, now that you are a father of a new-born baby?
    <br>If you can view me properly, you will know that I am still vibrating.
    <br>I don't know what to say. Thank You, Jesus!
