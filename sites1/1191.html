  <p>    
    <br>During the Sunday service at The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua begins to move
    <br>in the midst of the congregation under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The results are clear - healing and deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amidst the crowd is this young lady who falls violently to the ground as she receives prayer.
    <br>The evil spirit that was lurking in her has been exposed by the power of God.
    <br>Let's watch what happens next.
    <br>So she's free from the spirit of man inside her.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Lisa Venant, I'm twenty-three years old.
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my mother. I am from Tanzania.
    <br>Last Sunday the man of God delivered me from the spirit of man.
    <br>It has been tormenting me since I was 10 years old. I was in grade 3 by then.
    <br>It has lived inside me for 13 years.
    <br>This spirit got into me through dreams. I have been dreaming I was sleeping with a woman.
    <br>It has been living in me and whenever I used to wake up in the morning,
    <br>I used to have that desire of sleeping with a woman.
    <br>Any woman who used to come in front of me -
    <br>I used to approach any woman by that time I was in grade 3.
    <br>No woman ever denied me. They used to accept me.
    <br>It lived in me till I reached secondary school.
    <br>At that time I was in a boarding school.
    <br>Everything that I'm saying - my mum doesn't know about it.
    <br>When I was in secondary school, we had two preps - we had morning preps and night preps.
    <br>During morning preps, whenever they announced that we had to go to the classes to study,
    <br>I used to stay in the dormitory, sleeping with a woman.
    <br>Evening and morning preps I used to do the same.
    <br>At that time I used to sleep with three or four women per day.
    <br>So that spirit lived in me till I got to university.
    <br>I met one woman.
    <br>She approached me. I never knew she was married.
    <br>We dated and used to sleep together.  We had a relationship.
    <br>I never knew till the husband called me and warned me to stay away from his wife.
    <br>I did that.
    <br>But at that instant, he called my mom.
    <br>I don't know how he got her number and he told my mom to warn me to stay away from his wife.
    <br>I remember that day my mom called me and asked me about it.
    <br>But I never accepted it and denied that it was true.
    <br>I used to dress like a man, talk like a man, behave like a man.
    <br>I used to have that desire of sleeping with women - any woman who would just pass by.
    <br>I had that spirit pushing me - whenever I saw a woman,
    <br>I could never just let her pass me by.
    <br>So I just found myself approaching them.
    <br>But since I've been delivered, I'm sleeping well. I don't have that desire for women anymore.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>Yes, sister, before you tell us how God Almighty delivered you from that spirit,
    <br>can you share with us: Did you have any experience in the past that you will never forget
    <br>while you were tormented by this demon who caused you to have a desire for women like you?
    <br>Yes, I remember there was a day...
    <br>I'm talking about the past. I dated one woman.
    <br>We went to a hotel and I never knew the receptionist called the police and they came into our room.
    <br>That was an instance I will never forget.
    <br>Have you ever made any attempt to stop on your own, since you knew that this was a spirit
    <br>that was tormenting you, that you could not control?
    <br>Did you try to stop it by yourself?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I visited different churches seeking for my deliverance.
    <br>But because that spirit inside me was very strong -
    <br>the more I sought for deliverance, the more the spirit was pushing me
    <br>and taking me into that thing that has been tormenting me - the spirit of man.
    <br>And now, can you share with us: How did you finally come to The SCOAN?
    <br>After my mom realized that that spirit was tormenting me, she begged me to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Because of that spirit, I used to deny it before.
    <br>But because of what I've been going through, how my life has been,
    <br>I decided to accept my mom's offer and I said: "Okay, mom, now it's time to go to The SCOAN
    <br>to seek for mercy and my deliverance."
    <br>Last week, as you saw on the television, the man of God touched me.
    <br>He delivered me from the spirit of man that had been tormenting me for 13 years.
    <br>Right now, I thank God I'm free and I give God the glory.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus once again.
    <br>I give God the glory. I never used to put on earrings in my life.
    <br>I never used to dress like a lady but now I can see changes in me.
    <br>Once again, shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>With what God Almighty has done for you - before we listen to your mother -
    <br>what advice can you give to the youth?
    <br>My friends, even my brothers and sisters who are in this church right now,
    <br>the advice that I want to give you:
    <br>Please, I beg. If you have the same spirit that was tormenting me, please seek God.
    <br>Talk to your parents.
    <br>Explain to them what you feel, what you always dream - the bad dreams that you always have
    <br>so that they can seek for help. This spirit is a very bad spirit. It confuses you.
    <br>You lose your career. You cannot focus. It was very hard on me.
    <br>So please, if you have this spirit, just talk to your parents,
    <br>seek for God's help and He will help you.
    <br>My parents, if you have your children at home...
    <br>As I said, this spirit was tormenting me for 10 years.
    <br>You might think your child is a little kid of 8, 9 or 10.
    <br>But that's the age when the devil is very close to the kids
    <br>and he's tormenting them with different spirits.
    <br>So please, try and look after your kids. Focus on them.
    <br>Especially those who are in boarding schools, because there is a different type of life there.
    <br>You meet different people, different characters.
    <br>So please, whenever they come on holiday, get close to your kid
    <br>and that will help you to know, if it has any problem that is tormenting him or her.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus.
    <br>We give all the glory to God and we are very blessed by your advice.
    <br>We believe that viewers all around the world are listening to your advice -
    <br>parents are listening, guardians are listening.
    <br>I believe that the Lord will guide them to be able to look after their children
    <br>and train them in the way of the Lord, in Jesus' name.
    <br>My name is Flora Bina Moon.
    <br>I came from Tanzania. The lady beside me is my daughter.
    <br>The problem that brought us here to The SCOAN
    <br>was that spirit of man that was tormenting my daughter.
    <br>I thank God that last Sunday, she got her deliverance.
    <br>The other thing she has confessed here -  I didn't know that for almost 13 years...
    <br>Until that man called me and told me that I should tell my daughter to stay away from his wife.
    <br>I was so confused; I was shocked.
    <br> I called my daughter and asked her; she denied it.
    <br>After one week, she called me and said, "Mom, I'm sorry. 
    <br>That spirit has been tormenting me for a long time."
    <br>She started confessing to me.
    <br>After her deliverance, what are the changes that you have noticed as a mother?
    <br>I've seen a lot of changes - she sleeps well. Before, she didn't sleep.
    <br>At night, she used to chat on the phone - till the morning.
    <br>She walked like a man. She talked like a man.
    <br>But since last Sunday, she talks like a lady, she is close to me.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>You said she would normally chat on her phone in the past.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But now?
    <br>Now she's not chatting anymore.
    <br>With all you have heard from your daughter - what advice would you like to give to parents?
    <br>I advise all parents all over the world to watch and see what their kids are doing and seek God.
    <br>Once again, shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Because of the language barrier, her mommy is giving advice to parents all around the world
    <br>to please look after their children.
    <br>Don't say your children must get to a certain age before you watch over them
    <br>but at a young age, like our sister said - age of 8-9 years
    <br>- even the age you wouldn't think you needed to watch your children -
    <br>so that satan will not take them away from you.
    <br>We believe that the same God who has restored our sister, that has delivered her
    <br>from the spirit of man, will also deliver those who were listening to her right now,
    <br>those who have a similar problem, in Jesus' name.
    <br>After her dramatic deliverance and inspiring testimony,
    <br>it is time for Lisa Vilant to return to her homeland of Tanzania.
    <br>Lisa is eager for the very first time in her life to actually wear female clothing.
    <br>Taken into a shop, she begins to choose and size up various items of female clothing -
    <br>something she had never done before in her life.
    <br>Truly, she has been returned to the original position in which God created her - a female.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says:
    <br>"Faith is the transformative power of the universe - the power of change
    <br>from where you are, to where God wants you to be."

    <br>Lisa Venant & Mother 
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Lisa is about to embark on her journey back to Tanzania with her mother.
    <br>Lisa Venant & Mother 
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>A smile on her face says it all.
    <br>She is free indeed. And the spirit of man has gone forever.
    <br>Indeed, what a God we have to worship!
    <br>What a Son we have to praise and what a future lies before us!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
