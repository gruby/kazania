  <p>    
    <br>Christianity is all about relationship for the purpose of salvation.
    <br>We believe our God came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.
    <br>For you now to begin to think that you need to go to heaven to get what you need is wrong.
    <br>He is here. He is within. He is with you - He is in your heart.
    <br>You move with Him.
    <br>You stand with Him.
    <br>You are with Him.
    <br>You are an image of Him.
    <br>You just believe - He is around you.
    <br>I know you are ready to get that strong connection.
    <br>Now, it time for the mass prayer.
    <br>He sent forth His Word and healed them all.
    <br>Something is about to happen that will change the direction, your focus, your reasoning.
    <br>And when it happens, you will not remain the same.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Speak to yourself. This is the time to speak to yourself that something is about to happen.
    <br>And when it happens, my life will not remain the same.
    <br>Something is about to happen and when it happens, my life will not remain the same.
    <br>Your lifetime that is fulfilled - not the disappointed one - not failure.
    <br>Not setback - a fulfilled one.
    <br>Because in Him there is no sickness,
    <br>in Him there is no disappointment,
    <br>in Him there is nothing of what you are complaining about now.
    <br>Whatever you are complaining about now is not in Christ.
    <br>What are you complaining about? What is your situation, what is your challenge?
    <br>In Him there is no sickness,
    <br>in Him there is no disappointment,
    <br>in Him there is no failure.
    <br>Therefore, if you want to give your lifetime, be ready to be fulfilled.
    <br>This is the lifetime you will give -
    <br>a lifetime that is smooth, secure and protected.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>So not the burdened one.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Something is about to happen,
    <br>and what is about to happen will change your life perpetually.
    <br>And it will put your enemy into a cage perpetually.
    <br>I don't believe the issue of killing your enemy - you put your enemy into a cage perpetually.
    <br>Because this is why the Bible says, "I will set a table before you".
    <br>When you put your enemy into a cage, the table will be set before you,
    <br>and they will be in the cage and be looking at the table.
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>If you now kill your enemy, the table set before you with the essentials of life will be useless.
    <br>Because the table will be there and they will be looking, "Eh? It has happened!".
    <br>Therefore, can you see you have been offering a very wrong prayer which is not written anywhere?
    <br>You will want to kill your enemy, you want to do this,  you want to attend the funeral of your enemy.
    <br>If you kill them and the table is set before you with the essentials of life on the table, before who?
    <br>Before those people you have killed.
    <br>Believe that something is about to happen.
    <br>If you don't believe that something is about to happen ...
    <br>This is what the Bible says about faith:
    <br>Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised.
    <br>It is time now you should begin to celebrate - you have to celebrate before it happens.
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>Are you sick? Before that healing comes, begin to give testimony.
    <br>It is not after the healing - before that healing, you give testimony.
    <br>That is it. That is how faith works.
    <br>This is what your situation does not want to hear - testimony.
    <br>When you have a headache and you start saying, "Thank You, Jesus, for healing me".
    <br>Whereas you have a headache, and you are now saying, "Thank You for healing me" - the headache will disappear.
    <br>It does not want to hear that.
    <br>While you are having it, and you are now saying, "Thank You for healing me".
    <br>The headache will say, "Uh? What is he saying?".
    <br>"I want him to be crying. He is not crying. And he is now giving thanks to God" - it will now disappear.
    <br>The purpose of pain: Pain comes so you can lament or complain.
    <br>"I don't have a job. I have nothing".
    <br>That is what situation stands for - the cause of that situation - to make you lament and complain.
    <br>And when you are doing that, where is God? No God!
    <br>Because God cannot stand where there is lamenting, complaining or crying.
    <br>God stands for happiness, peace.
    <br>They want you to complain; they want you to lament.
    <br>And once you begin to lament and complain, you are no longer a Christian.
    <br>Complaining and crying, "What is all this?" - you are no longer a Christian at that moment.
    <br>You can never be one with God with lamenting,
    <br>you can never be one with God with complaining,
    <br>you can never be one with God with crying.
    <br>Because even when you do that before you sleep, you will definitely have a nightmare.
    <br>If you lament, you cry, you complain before you sleep, don't expect to dream. You will have a nightmare.
    <br>The state of your heart, the state of your mind matters before prayer.
    <br>What matters? The state of your heart matters.
    <br>If you are happy before you begin to pray, definitely you are talking to God.
    <br>But if you are sad or lamenting, you are not talking to God; you are talking to yourself and satan.
    <br>These are the things that do not allow your spirit to be free and God wants a free spirit to operate.
    <br>God wants a free spirit to talk to you.
    <br>If your spirit is free, the Spirit of God will contact your spirit.
    <br>Free spirit. Let someone say, "Free spirit".
    <br>When you begin to complain, your spirit is in bondage.
    <br>There is a bondage that you weigh in your spirit.
    <br>Right now, you can open your lips and begin to talk to yourself.
    <br>Leave it for God; don't worry yourself.
    <br>Something is about to happen - leave it for God; don't worry yourself.
    <br>Allow joy! Allow peace!
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Because you need to be released from your past.
    <br>Ability to look at where we are going comes when we ignore where we are coming from, where we have been.
    <br>Right now, begin to cage demons.
    <br>That man is not your enemy.
    <br>That woman is not your enemy.
    <br>We are not fighting flesh and blood, but spirit beings.
    <br>Right now, begin to cage that satan, that demon - cage it.
    <br>Begin to cage them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Show your dominion right now as a child of God.
    <br>Begin to show your dominion.
    <br>Cage them - demons are your enemy.
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Those demons are responsible for your setback, limitation, shortcomings,
    <br>disappointment, that affliction, sickness, disease - demons are responsible.
    <br>It is not your brother, it is not your sister, it is not your cousin, it is not your father.
    <br>We are not fighting flesh and blood, but demons - spirit beings - that cause tension and pressure.
    <br>Right now, begin to cage those demons - put them in a perpetual cage!
    <br>Open your lips. Put them in a perpetual cage!
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The Lord said I should come in.
    <br>The Lord said to me that I should come in.
    <br>Ok, you have said it. You have put them in a cage. You find it difficult to put them in a cage.
    <br>The Lord said, "Come into the matter".
    <br>Let's join together and put these demons into a cage.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Coming together is stronger.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Togetherness is stronger.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Togetherness is stronger.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Togetherness is stronger.
    <br>Maybe you don't understand what I am saying:
    <br>Two believers are better than one.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Two believers are better than one.
    <br>Togetherness is stronger.
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>Your Word is healing; Your Word is liberation.
    <br>Right now, begin to liberate my people, free my people - free them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When you are liberated, it separates you from darkness.
    <br>Whatever that is not of God that you possess, begin to reject it - curse them out!
    <br>And begin to possess of God, right now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every covenant of satan - out!
    <br>Covenant of attitude - out!
    <br>Covenant of character - out!
    <br>Begin to reject them, right now.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>These are the characters that you know.
    <br>You heard what Apostle Paul said. He said, "What I want to do is not what I am doing".
    <br>"What I intend to do is not what I am doing".
    <br>"If I now do what I do not intend to do" - it is sin in him that made him do it. This was Apostle Paul.
    <br>Every satanic covenant - in whatever way, either generational curses or whatever -
    <br>begin to reject them out of your life! Prayer!
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>I quoted Apostle Paul; he was an apostle when he was confessing this.
    <br>That is in Romans 7:19, "What I intend to do is not what I am doing".
    <br>"If I am now doing what I don't intend to do", it means that it was the sin in him that made him do it.
    <br>He recognised that.
    <br>That shows that there is a satanic covenant of attitude.
    <br>Open your lips right now.
    <br>We are in the atmosphere of deliverance.
    <br>Begin to eject that attitude out!
    <br>Curse it out!
    <br>Open your lips. Prayer!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances

    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances

    <br>[This is my desire to honour You]
    <br>Watch your screen and begin to be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>[Lord, with all my heart I worship You]
    <br>- Bring them out, wherever they are.
    <br>- [All I have within me I give You praise]
    <br>- Come out!
    <br>- [All that I adore is in You]

    <br>[Lord, I give you my heart]
    <br>[I give You my soul]
    <br>[I live for You alone]
    <br>[Every breath that I take]
    <br>[Every moment I'm awake]
    <br>[Lord, have Your way in me]
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>- Every satanic covenant
    <br>- [Out!]
    <br>The Lord is good.
    <br>- [All the time]
    <br>- I can't hear you.
    <br>- [All the time]
    <br>- Every satanic covenant
    <br>- [Out!]
    <br>- The Lord is good
    <br>- [All the time]
    <br>- All the time
    <br>- [The Lord is good]
    <br>Every satanic covenant, begin to eject them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Look, listen to my confession:
    <br>I see satan running! I see satan leaving - begin to confess this in your life.
    <br>I can see satan leaving! I see satan running!
    <br>I can see the chains breaking!
    <br>I can see satan going! Go!
    <br>I can see satan leaving!
    <br>Leaving my business!

    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>How long have you been in this body?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "For six years".
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Through dream".
    <br>Who are you? Speak out!
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Marine husband".
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Setback".
    <br>What else?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Disappointment".
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>You will now open your lips.
    <br>Those weaknesses you have
    <br>- the spirit of killing, stealing, the spirit of lying, the spirit of smoking -
    <br>I can see it going, leaving your life!
    <br>Confession! Prayer!
    <br>Begin to confess them out!
    <br>Worship Him!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Your body is the temple of God; it is not the temple of sickness, disease or affliction.
    <br>I can locate those places, disease and sickness - loose your grip, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your body is not an abode for sickness; it is not a home for disease.
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Sickness, wherever you are located - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Have you been poisoned? Whatever way you may have eaten that poison -
    <br>eating or drinking from the table of your enemy -
    <br>I command that disease, that poison to come out!
    <br>Open your lips right now.
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>Worship Him!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Others are rejoicing with you; rejoice with them.
    <br>If you know people are rejoicing with you, rejoice with them.
    <br>Why should people rejoice with you?
    <br>They are rejoicing with you because you have been liberated.
    <br>Now, you rejoice with them in return. Rejoice!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>You have proved your dominion.

    <br>dominion over evil,
    <br>you have proved your dominion over sin.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The prayers we have offered for the past two to three minutes are a prophetic word for you.
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>The way out for your life has come!
    <br>The way out for your marriage has come!
    <br>The way out has come!
    <br>YOU WILL NOT REMAIN THE SAME AFTER THIS PRAYER!!!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Give thanks to God.

    <br>because of crisis - war zones.
    <br>Remember those nations in prayer.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Pray for your nation, your country.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations With Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>Prayer For The Nations With Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Every satanic covenant - corruption.
    <br>Corruption is a satanic covenant.
    <br>Corruption, killing, stealing and destruction.
    <br>Lord Jesus, redeem our nations.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Worship Him. Give thanks to God.

    <br>In every area - within, outside - your desire be granted, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let your desire be granted, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your desire is to follow Jesus.
    <br>Your desire is to grow in your spiritual life.
    <br>Then, you can enjoy the prayer fruit.
    <br>Let there be light in all your ways.
    <br>Your direction - east, south, west, north - let there be light!
    <br>Your relationship, business relationship, marriage, family,
    <br>health, finances, business - let there be light!
    <br>Right now, begin to confess the love of God in your life.
    <br>He loves me; that is why I am praying. I pray freely, I walk freely.
    <br>He loves me so much, just like any other apostle.
    <br>[He loves me I cannot say why]
    <br>[On Calvary tree He suffered for me]
    <br>[He loves me I cannot say why]
    <br>Open your lips and begin to confess the love of God in your life.
    <br>He loves you so much.
    <br>You are here for the first time, or you are knowing Jesus for the first time.
    <br>Let us strengthen your desire more - your journey with Jesus.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul.
    <br>You are my Saviour; save my soul.
    <br>Make me a channel - a channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Make me a channel - a channel of pardon where there is injury.
    <br>Make me a channel - a channel of righteousness where there is sin.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's mighty name.
    <br>I can't hear your 'Amen'.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer.
