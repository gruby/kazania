    <br>THE YOUNG LADY SENT TO SEDUCE TB JOSHUA!!! ⚠️
    <br>We are about to witness of confessions of people who came to The SCOAN with evil intentions.
    <br>Some of these women had plans to seduce and sleep with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>others to destroy him, and still others to cease the power of God given to him.
    <br>Let us listen to the confession of Ifeoma.
    <br>I am Ifeoma Ejiogwu, an ogbanje, an agent of the devil.
    <br>I cause destruction in the world.
    <br>I have seven powers.
    <br>I use them for destruction.
    <br>Any man that meets me, if he's rich, he will become poor.
    <br>If you are poor, you will never rise up again.
    <br>The man will go down completely.
    <br>If you are a married man, you will have problems with your wife.
    <br>You will never have a happy home.
    <br>It at times, ends up in divorce.
    <br>To me, this is the only place that is called a church that I've not been able to win the man of God.
    <br>I always lure them.
    <br>If I just look at your eyes, you will fall.
    <br>My face - I use it to magnetize.
    <br>If I look at you and smile, you will fall back.
    <br>Here, Ifeoma demonstrates it, how she uses her evil power through her facial expressions,
    <br>to tease men, seducing them with her eyes and smile.
    <br>My face, I use it to magnetize.
    <br>If I just look at your eyes, you will fall.
    <br>And so many pastors - because of the power in me, I lure them.
    <br>And if I want to punish anyone, if I go to his church, I will sit at the front row.
    <br>We see Ifeoma sitting in the front row of the church displaying her legs.
    <br>She explains how she harasses them to gain the pastor's attention, in order to entice him.
    <br>At times, I even wear a short dress.
    <br>Displaying her legs, she explains  how she harasses them to gain the pastor's attention,
    <br>in order to entice him.
    <br>Here at The SCOAN however, these seductive tactics had failed to work on Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I can't look at your eyes.
    <br>It seems the power she had previously boasted of in her own eyes, was now rendered useless.
    <br>Here we can see her being delivered, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>THE YOUNG LADY SENT TO SEDUCE TB JOSHUA!!! ⚠️
    <br>Her evil schemes did not work out.
    <br>Despite trying, she was unable to entice the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The advice I want to give the children of God is that they should be careful,
    <br>especially the men among us.
    <br>The way they move around when they see a beautiful girl.
    <br>They stop and pick you up.
    <br>You don't know what you are picking up.
    <br>At times, what you pick up might end up being the end of your life.
    <br>So, you better be careful and give it up now 
    <br>because I have destroyed so many people that called themselves men of God and even children of God.
    <br>Don't you ever be carried away by Ifeoma's beauty
    <br>because there are so many Ifeomas out there looking for whom to devour.
    <br>Ifeoma gives her confession, explaining how she used to destroy many people,
    <br>including men of God and the children of God in general.
    <br>During her deliverance Ifeoma advised people, and especially men to be careful
    <br>and not to be carried away by beautiful girls.
    <br>She said there are many like her in the world, looking for whom to devour.
    <br>The best thing for you to do is just to marry Christ and be faithful with your God because
    <br>whilst you go out and you are not strong enough, they must destroy you.
    <br>Like in my case; it was compulsory - he cannot, except I don't want you.
    <br>So many of them have power like that outside.
    <br>After her total deliverance, Ifeoma came back to The SCOAN to give her testimony
    <br>and to allow the children of God to learn from her experience.

    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>On behalf of my 'ex-ogbanjes',
    <br>I stand here this afternoon to greet and to thank the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua for all he has done in our lives.
    <br>Before now, I have been to so many places, I have tired so many witchdoctors.
    <br>I never knew I would be free till I found myself in The SCOAN.
    <br>The whole congregation should help me to shout seven 'Emmanuels' to the honour of God!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
