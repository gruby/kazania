  <p>    
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me.
    <br>I can't do anything at home.
    <br>I have gone to the hospitals but they can't help me;
    <br>they said I must wear this corset for the rest of my life.
    <br>I can't do duties at home.
    <br>It is difficult to drive my car.
    <br>Please, man of God, help me.
    <br>It is difficult for me to do my sewing or to help my children.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me!
    <br>I am using a lumbar corset.
    <br>I went to hospitals but they can't help me.
    <br>I have gone to the doctors but they can't help me.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me!
    <br>I have got difficulty in walking.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Can you imagine, someone who could not walk.
    <br>She was sitting and could not walk and was brought here today.
    <br>Imagine - the Spirit of God moved close and she started fighting.
    <br>That means, the one that cannot walk is not part of you;
    <br>the one that is sick is not part of you.
    <br>Say, "The one that is sick is not part of me.
    <br>The one that is troubled is not part of me.
    <br>The one that is worried is not part of me."
    <br>This is why you should not allow your worry to disturb your focus.
    <br>You can be worried and troubled but your focus should remain.
    <br>Look at this woman.
    <br>She was sitting down, she could not walk,
    <br>she has evidence, a medical report, she was brought here today.
    <br>I don't know whether anyone has seen someone who could not walk for many years,
    <br>and suddenly the man of God just gets there;
    <br>she says, "Man of God, help me. I cannot walk, talk..."
    <br>and the man of God just walks to her and says, "What are you saying?"

    <br>Let's ask her, "Come on. Why did you leave the seat?"
    <br>No, no, no. You can't deliver her.
    <br>She must struggle for the rest of her life.
    <br>Healing has now turned to deliverance.
    <br>She says I cannot deliver her.
    <br>"No, I cannot wait for you to touch her" - it means the one inside of her is saying,
    <br>"Look, you cannot deliver her. I will not wait for you to touch me."
    <br>And she was crying for healing.
    <br>Healing has turned to deliverance.
    <br>BAD IDEA: Demon Tries To Fight TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Come.
    <br>I am not talking to you, I am talking to the spirit that caused you this problem.
    <br>Come - you.
    <br>Not you I am looking at.
    <br>Before I count to three; one, two...
    <br>Remove it yourself.
    <br>BAD IDEA: Demon Tries To Fight TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am an ancestral spirit.
    <br>What kind of spirit?
    <br>She doesn't want to obey us.
    <br>She was supposed to be a sangoma for a long time but she doesn't want to.
    <br>She is so stubborn.
    <br>She is supposed to be a witch doctor but she doesn't want to.
    <br>Where are you from?
    <br>I am from her mother's side and her father's side.
    <br>- What have you done?
    <br>- I destroyed her life.
    <br>She is divorced; she is staying with her three children.
    <br>She is staying with her children because she is so stupid.
    <br>OK. No one can marry you.
    <br>No! She can't get married.
    <br>She is always watching this T.B. Joshua in her room and in her lounge.
    <br>She is watching T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You have chained us for a long time.
    <br>Do you want to fight me?
    <br>Me, fight you?
    <br>I am waiting for; just come.
    <br>BAD IDEA: Demon Tries To Fight TB Joshua!!!
    <br>No, it is you who will come.
    <br>I said, come.
    <br>- You will fight my back.
    <br>- No, I can't fight your back.
    <br>Come here. One, two, three. Come here.
    <br>Be on your knees and your back on the floor.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>BAD IDEA: Demon Tries To Fight TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Those things they have deposited in the body are the ones coming out.
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The body is a lifeless body.
    <br>Give life to the body.
    <br>Sometimes, when you try to carry them, you don't know that they are lifeless.
    <br>- Do you know what happened to you now?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- You said you would fight me.
    <br>- No.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>OK. Thank you. Walk around.
    <br>BAD IDEA: Demon Tries To Fight TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I'm free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Why are you crying?
    <br>I had been suffering for a long time.
    <br>For how long have you been in this predicament, unable to walk?
    <br>For seven years.
    <br>Do that and let us see.
    <br>BAD IDEA: Demon Tries To Fight TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Khangelwa Gloria Cotho.
    <br>My age is 42.
    <br>I am coming from South Africa.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a severe back pain.
    <br>I was using a lumbar corset.
    <br>I was using the lumbar corset because the pain was so severe.
    <br>I couldn't do the things I used to do like clean the house and cook.
    <br>To do things for my children was difficult for me because of the back pain.
    <br>It affected me big time because I am a fashion designer.
    <br>There was nobody that could help me to do my sewing; I was doing it by myself.
    <br>If I had an order for 10 dresses, I had to cut that number.
    <br>I used to finish that 10 like nothing before.
    <br>But when I had the back pain, I couldn't do it.
    <br>To do everything by myself was so difficult for me because of the back pain.
    <br>The lumbar corset was not helping me that much.
    <br>It was just supporting me to sit straight but did not take the pain away.
    <br>I was also using painkillers.
    <br>If I were to take two tablets, I would take four to try and alleviate the pain but it didn't help.
    <br>I would go to the doctors, have x-rays done and be told that nothing was wrong
    <br>but the pain would be there.
    <br>There was a time that I decided not to go to the doctors anymore
    <br>because I was tired of spending my money.
    <br>The money that I was working for,
    <br>I was not using it for the things I was supposed to use it for.
    <br>I decided that enough was enough, that I wasn't going to the doctors anymore.
    <br>I decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>A friend of mine, I visited her and she had this channel.
    <br>I saw the testimonies.
    <br>When I saw one of the testimonies, it was wonderful for me
    <br>because I thought that if that man could get help,
    <br>then my back pain was nothing to God and I would be able to get help also.
    <br>When I got to the prayer line, I sat there and when the man of God came near to me,
    <br>I had an anger and bitterness that made me want to hit him.
    <br>But I could not hit him because there was a light between us.
    <br>I could not beat him and became scared of him.
    <br>I couldn't fight him because of the light.
    <br>I tried to run away and I don't know what happened after that.
    <br>The only thing I can remember after that
    <br>was when the man of God was saying to me, "Stand up."
    <br>When he asked me to stand up, my body felt very light.
    <br>I can't remember my body feeling as light as it is.
    <br>Previously, my body would be painful and I was always tired.
    <br>As I am standing here now, I can jump, dance and do whatever.
    <br>Previously, I could not bend or lift up my hands, freely.
    <br>I had to adjust myself for everything I did.
    <br>After my deliverance and healing yesterday, when I went to bed,
    <br>it was like, "Wow!" because I slept like a baby.
    <br>Another lady had to wake me up because I was fast asleep.
    <br>Indeed, Jesus Christ is the Master Healer and there is never a sickness Jesus Christ cannot heal.
    <br>My advice is this: Everyone should trust God and depend on Him.
    <br>As for me, I didn't depend on God; I thought I was depending on God.
    <br>I was depending on myself.
    <br>My advice to the people out there
    <br>is that it doesn't matter how many problems you have;
    <br>everything is possible for God.
    <br>Any problem you have is minor to God - it is nothing.
    <br>Just come to God and He will do the work.
    <br>We can see you holding the lumbar corset.
    <br>What do you want to do with it?
    <br>No, no no. I don't need it anymore.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus one more time.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Now, madam, we want you to please demonstrate to us those things you could not do before,
    <br>that you are to do now, after your healing.
    <br>BAD IDEA: Demon Tries To Fight TB Joshua!!!
    <br>Put your hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>Yes. We have just witnessed the glory of God in the life of our mother here.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for everything that He has done in your life.
    <br>We thank God and we wish you all the best, in Jesus' name.
