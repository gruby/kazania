    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>PASTOR KNOCKS DOWN HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!!!
    <br>I am Louis Okeke, (Super Armstrong Of Africa), professional wrestler.
    <br>I am the current national champion of Nigeria - undefeated!
    <br>In Nigeria - nationally, I am number one.
    <br>All the people who challenge me - I beat them.
    <br>We do elimination fights in the wrestling federation.
    <br>- You beat them up?
    <br>- I beat them up.
    <br>I am in the heavyweight category.
    <br>- Are you into secret cults?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Really, God gave me supernatural power.
    <br>I made a mistake; I offended God.
    <br>I had supernatural power given to me by God.
    <br>- Given to you by God?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Eventually, they misled me
    <br>by giving me some native idols which they said I had to worship.
    <br>They gave me the idol as an inheritance from my mother's side
    <br>and that I must become a native doctor.
    <br>This thing kept disturbing me, causing accidents and putting me in big problems.
    <br>I have been to prison several times.
    <br>I can beat up to 10 or 20 big people.
    <br>When they came to arrest me, I would beat them up and break their guns.
    <br>When they locked me up,
    <br>the power in me would enable me to leave the cell, go to my house, eat and return to the cell.
    <br>They would not know.
    <br>I didn't see the cell as a guardroom because I could leave at any time.
    <br>Is it visible or invisible?
    <br>They didn't know when I went.
    <br>- By a contrary force?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Sometimes they would shoot at me.
    <br>When I fought with them, they would shoot at me but the bullets never entered my body.
    <br>- All this by strange, contrary powers?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- That is why I am even crying.
    <br>- That is why you are crying?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It has been written that he will lead in his profession as a 'guru'.
    <br>Glory be to God - you are able to confess.
    <br>How did you come about this trouble?
    <br>I was always involved in this kind of thing.
    <br>I don't like to see people being cheated or people I knew being beaten up.
    <br>I must go and fight for the person.
    <br>Where I parked my car, two young men were fighting,
    <br>so I decided to go and help and break up the fight.
    <br>When I reached the place where they were fighting, I managed to break up the fight.
    <br>When I was turning away, I heard someone say, "See fire!"
    <br>I turned around and someone said, "Uncle, see fire!"
    <br>At your back?
    <br>I thought the fire was somewhere else.
    <br>I didn't know the fire was already on my trousers, burning me.
    <br>When I shook my leg, the fire spread to my shirt.
    <br>Then, I started running, calling for assistance but nobody came.
    <br>When I ran towards people, they would run away.
    <br>I removed my shirt, fell on the ground and removed my trousers.
    <br>My socks were burning; I removed them.
    <br>Those clothes burned to ashes.
    <br>That was what happened.
    <br>Nobody could see where the fire came from.
    <br>If this fire was ordinary fire, do you not think you would be cured by now?
    <br>I don't think this was ordinary fire.
    <br>Despite all the power you had, a small boy said, "See fire at your back" - the fire caught you.
    <br>This shows you that when you talk of human beings -
    <br>if a human being gives you something, whatever they give you is limited.
    <br>But what God can give you is unlimited.
    <br>Limited in the sense that somebody else may have more than you.
    <br>But if God wants to bless you, He will bless you in such a way that
    <br>nowhere in the world you could stand, and His glory and honour would not be seen in your life.
    <br>Now, what is your promise to God, sir?
    <br>Because I am here to promise you, before God Almighty;
    <br>God says He will cure you, and you will be healed perfectly.
    <br>If God does not intervene, this leg would be amputated, because it is decaying.
    <br>The fire is eating the leg.
    <br>Look at the water dropping.
    <br>Blood is dropping.
    <br>It is dropping as if the fire just burnt you.
    <br>- Was it today the fire burned you?
    <br>- Today is two months.
    <br>Today is two months and the water is still dropping.
    <br>It means it is still eating your leg.
    <br>I am here to minister to you that
    <br>God Almighty says He will heal you.
    <br>Not only will you be healed, you will go back and you will remain a champion.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I promise God that from today, I will sin no more.
    <br>I will not involve myself with the occult anymore.
    <br>And you now agree that there is potential in your life,
    <br>and it is God Almighty that put that, it was not a human being.
    <br>I know and I agree that God is Almighty and He has given me all power.
    <br>Any other power I acquired is rubbish.
    <br>And you are ready to disown them.
    <br>I am ready to destroy all of them.
    <br>At the same time, I promise to serve God throughout my life.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Praise the Living Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You are seeing the super champion...
    <br>Put your hands together for the miracle-working God!
    <br>That is the super heavyweight champion undefeated in Africa -
    <br>the Holy Spirit has laid him on the floor, in the process of removing all the problems
    <br>and afflictions from his life.
    <br>This is a man who was bound...
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>I won't do it again!
    <br>I confess. I won't do it again!
    <br>Never again!
    <br>Truly, I tell you that I won't do it again.
    <br>I will bring out everything tomorrow.
    <br>Please, I will serve God forever.
    <br>I won't do it again.
    <br>Nobody can send me to do any silly thing again.
    <br>I hand my life over to God.
    <br>I will sin no more.
    <br>You are the Prophet sent by God - Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You can see that with all the power you had, the 'super power of the world' fell down.
    <br>It is true.
    <br>Please, forgive me.
    <br>I will serve God in my life, till I die.
    <br>Watch me - I will be reporting to you.
    <br>Please.
    <br>Has anybody made you fall down like that before?
    <br>Nobody.
    <br>Before I will ask you to rise and walk:
    <br>Who is God?
    <br>God is Almighty.
    <br>- And you will always see Him as Almighty?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>In you life, in your house, in your work, in your way, in everywhere?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Put your hands together for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Right now, stand up!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>No problem.
    <br>One two three...
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Don't worry. Go there. You are free.
    <br>I want you to move your leg fine and walk like this.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Put your hands together for the King of glory.
    <br>When the Son sets you free, you are totally set free.
    <br>Look at him, hitting that leg on the ground, as if nothing has ever happened to him.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>How is your body now?
    <br>It is healed; it is good.
    <br>My leg is good.
    <br>The pain has gone.
    <br>I don't feel any pain.
    <br>I know you are the 'super power' in Nigeria here.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I want to let you know that with God, you can be more than that.
    <br>Please, have God as Alpha and Omega.
    <br>Right now, I will give you the name of God.
    <br>If you call the name of God, you will see the way your body will move.
    <br>Call the name "Jesus" and see.
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>PASTOR KNOCKS DOWN HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!!!
    <br>Look, you know you were undefeated and you want your power to be 'top'.
    <br>Call the name Jesus and see the way the power...
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>PASTOR KNOCKS DOWN HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!!!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Healed Of Fire Burns In Jesus' Name
    <br>PASTOR KNOCKS DOWN HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!!!
    <br>Healed Of Fire Burns In Jesus' Name
    <br>After receiving divine healing following the prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua in Jesus' name,
    <br>the burns on Louis Okeke's leg healed and he returned to action in the ring.
    <br>His wrestling career began to thrive
    <br>and he later became the African Super Heavyweight Wrestling Champion.
    <br>An African Superheavyweight contest between champion Super Big Daddy
    <br>and his challenger, Super Armstrong Of Africa.
    <br>Both wrestlers are Nigerians.
    <br>And taking the fight outside the ring.
    <br>This is the Africa...
    <br>Oh, he misses it!
    <br>The new African Superheavyweight champion - Super Armstrong Of Africa.
    <br>How does it feel to be the strongest man in Africa?
    <br>I feel like a new-born baby.
    <br>I feel very happy.
    <br>I thank God Almighty.
    <br>I thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, who made me to be alive today,
    <br>before I was able to fight at all.
    <br>Because I was a dead man before.
    <br>They were happy.
    <br>Everybody thought I was dead.
    <br>Louis Okeke, AKA Super Armstrong of Africa, came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to thank God for saving his life.
    <br>My name is Mr Louis Okeke (Super Armstrong Of Africa).
    <br>I don't know where to start telling the story of my life.
    <br>If I start by sharing my life history now, we would not leave here today because I have a lot to say.
    <br>To start with my healing, I believe you have all seen how I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Formerly, I was a pagan.
    <br>I never went to church.
    <br>I had an idol I worshipped.
    <br>I believed in cultism.
    <br>I engaged myself in all kinds of atrocities.
    <br>While I was in that predicament, a brother came to visit me in hospital.
    <br>He told me of a church in Ikotun-Egbe where the man worked more than native doctors,
    <br>that he could heal HIV, cancer and all kinds of incurable diseases.
    <br>I said to myself if this man could do these, then he could heal my leg.
    <br>I told him that something like a worm usually moved in my leg during the night.
    <br>I told him that the fire burn was not ordinary but linked to witchcraft.
    <br>He said that even if the fire was caused by witchcraft or man-made, the man would heal you.
    <br>The leg was decaying on the inside while it looked fresh on the surface - outside.
    <br>I could not go to the toilet to either defecate or urinate.
    <br>I would defecate on the same spot I ate.
    <br>When he told me about Ikotun-Egbe, I was sceptical because it was a church.
    <br>I thought to myself, "Had I not tried the church before?"
    <br>I remembered that I had stared attending a church in my dream.
    <br>If that was the place where I could find a solution, then we should go there.
    <br>When I came on Wednesday, I was ashamed of myself because the whole world was watching.
    <br>I thought this was a small church where I would be taken to a corner and prayed for.
    <br>When I saw that people were looking at me like a thief,
    <br>I became annoyed with the man who brought me.
    <br>I said, "My friend, why did you bring me to this kind of place?
    <br>You know that I am very popular person.
    <br>You could have taken me to a hidden place."
    <br>People were looking at me as if I was the thief and shouting, "Armstrong!"
    <br>I was planning on running away but there was no way out as I could not use my leg.
    <br>I told my brother to start my car and bring it to the front of the gate
    <br>so that I could sneak out when the attention was not on me.
    <br>He said I was not going anywhere.
    <br>My wife took my car key away from me.
    <br>I was tired and started to sweat.
    <br>My body felt as if fire had been poured on it.
    <br>Whenever the man of God passed by me, I would feel fire all over my body.
    <br>I told my wife that this man uses charms.
    <br>I never knew that it was the charms I was using that were disturbing me.
    <br>My wife asked why I was talking in that way.
    <br>I said he was a native doctor and not a pastor.
    <br>My wife asked my why I concluded that.
    <br>I said if he passed by, I would feel the vibration of fire in my body.
    <br>PASTOR KNOCKS DOWN HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!!!
    <br>My wife told me not to say these things to the hearing of others.
    <br>My own charms were always on my body.
    <br>Most of the charms I had then were on my body.
    <br>When the man of God came, I expected him to pray the way other churches prayed for people.
    <br>He opened his eyes wide and looked at me.
    <br>I thought to myself, "This man, you are crazy!"
    <br>I asked if he wanted to try me.
    <br>When he looked at me, I looked back at him.
    <br>I said I had stronger eyes than his and that he should try harder.
    <br>I was looking at him; I never believed he was praying for me.
    <br>When he was looking at me like that, more fire descended on my body.
    <br>I felt the fire was removing things from my body.
    <br>Everything started going away and I started struggling.
    <br>If I had my way, I would have left.
    <br>I saw him move his leg like this in the air.
    <br>When he raised his leg, I felt someone pulling on my back and then pushed me to the ground.
    <br>That was when I shouted, saying I was sorry, that I would not try him again
    <br>and that I would confess all of my sins.
    <br>People who were present on that day would agree that my confession was almost an hour.
    <br>I started my confession but did not finish it.
    <br>When asked if I had finished confessing, I said I still had more to confess.
    <br>When I opened my heart and confessed everything,
    <br>that was when I was forgiven by God.
    <br>PASTOR KNOCKS DOWN HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!!!
    <br>On that day, he told me to rise up and walk.
    <br>I wondered how I would do that
    <br>and wanted to tell my people to come and assist me.
    <br>He said nobody should touch me - that I should get up on my own.
    <br>He said I should rise up in Jesus' name.
    <br>I placed my hands on the ground.
    <br>It felt as if someone was helping me.
    <br>I moved like someone who never had any problem.
    <br>Immediately, I stood up.
    <br>I looked at my legs; everywhere that was hot before became cold.
    <br>He pronounced that I was going to be the 'Armstrong of the world' after my healing.
    <br>That day, I was doubting.
    <br>This very African Championship - I had applied for it at least three or four times
    <br>but it was not approved.
    <br>After my healing, I knelt down and prayed to God that as I was going back to wrestling,
    <br>He should open my way, and that everything I applied for should be approved.
    <br>To my surprise, when I went to the national stadium,
    <br>I was given an approval letter from the African Wrestling Council,
    <br>that I was to contest as the number one contender.
    <br>After my deliverance, I never knew there was a special grace that followed me in all I did.
    <br>Anywhere I went and anything I put my hand to, prospered.
    <br>He said he would give me words of faith to say, which would help me.
    <br>He referred me to 1 Samuel 17:45.
    <br>He said that if I meditated on that Scripture, I may win the wrestling match.
    <br>When I read that Scripture, I saw that it was about the battle between David and Goliath.
    <br>I said my contender was Goliath while I was David.
    <br>I liked that portion of Scripture.
    <br>I started reading it.
    <br>The man of God taught us to insert our name anywhere the message was personal to us.
    <br>I inserted my name and the name of my contender.
    <br>I said he was coming against me in the spirit of Goliath.
    <br>I said I was from Africa, coming against him with the power of the Almighty God.
    <br>I declared: The God that gave Daniel victory over the lions,
    <br>the God that gave David victory over Goliath,
    <br>He would put him in my hands and I would make a public spectacle of him,
    <br>so that people would believe that Jesus is the same yesterday, today and for evermore,
    <br>and He will remain our Champion forever and ever!
    <br>PASTOR KNOCKS DOWN HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!!!
    <br>I said Jesus will remain my champion and He will reign for ever and ever!
    <br>I heeded the man of God's advice not to talk any longer as the people of the world.
    <br>My contender brought me outside the ring,
    <br>slammed me on the ground and shouted insults at me.
    <br>While on the ground, I looked up and saw that he wanted to land on me.
    <br>By the grace, I was able to move away from the spot and got up!
    <br>I was able to overcome him!
    <br>I heard him shouting, "My waist! My hand!"
    <br>I got up and saw that he did not get up.
    <br>Then, I hit him with my hand.
    <br>I entered the ring but didn't know the fight had ended.
    <br>I was waiting, hoping he would come back into the ring.
    <br>Then, I was feeling confident because I had scored a point.
    <br>I thought he would come but he never stood up.
    <br>That's how the fight ended.
