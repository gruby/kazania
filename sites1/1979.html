    <br>This is T.B. Joshua praying for international visitors
    <br>who came from far and wide in search of solution
    <br>to their various predicaments they found themselves in.
    <br>Among them is Pastor Alcir Desa who came due to array of problems;
    <br>heart palpitations, fatigue - just to name a few.
    <br>After receiving a touch that pressed in to release any chain holding Pastor Desa down, he falls,
    <br>signifying the new state of his challenges - gone, in Jesus' name.
    <br>NAZARETH MEETING
    <br>WITH TB JOSHUA
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Alcir Desa.
    <br>I am originally from Brazil.
    <br>Now, I am living in USA.
    <br>I came this wonderful evening to give my testimony.
    <br>I came from a dysfunctional family; there were many problems in my family.
    <br>Because of that, I had depression.
    <br>The depression was so severe that I wanted to take my life.
    <br>I remember there was a time when I went to a subway,
    <br>I heard a voice telling me to take my life.
    <br>Even though I was a pastor, I could still hear that voice.
    <br>When I was approaching the track, the voice was telling me to jump.
    <br>Suddenly, another voice told me not to jump, so I stepped back.
    <br>This depression continued in my life.
    <br>The voice was telling me that I was not going to have a good relationship with my family.
    <br>I had infections in my stomach.
    <br>These infections caused a lot of pain in my stomach.
    <br>With this depression, I had problems with my heart - it would beat very fast.
    <br>Sometimes, I felt weak, anxious and depressed with these infections.
    <br>I looked for divine healing and testimonies about divine healing on the Internet.
    <br>I continued to watch them.
    <br>The Holy Spirit spoke to my heart to go to Lagos, to The SCOAN.
    <br>On my own, I went to The SCOAN in Lagos.
    <br>When T.B. Joshua approached me, I could feel pain and agony in my stomach.
    <br>Something was coming out of me.
    <br>T.B. Joshua prayed for me, hit my stomach and then I fell to the floor.
    <br>When I fell down, I heard a voice say, "You are free! Stand up!"
    <br>After that prayer, something came out through my rectum.
    <br>A liquid came out of me.
    <br>Now, I am free!
    <br>That happened five years ago.
    <br>Now, my life has changed!
    <br>My marriage has changed!
    <br>My ministry has changed!
    <br>My health has changed!
    <br>My heart has changed!
    <br>Now, I don't feel any pain in my stomach.
    <br>My emotions, feelings - everything now is good.
    <br>No anxiety, no depression and no evil voice talking to me.
    <br>Now, I can hear the voice of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Brothers and sisters, this evening, I advise you to keep your faith in Jesus.
    <br>Keep your faith in God.
    <br>God can do miracles today.
    <br>He is always available for those who seek Him in faith.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Now, for the benefit of those who are watching you all over the world,
    <br>can you just summarize your wonderful testimony in your native language, in Portuguese?
