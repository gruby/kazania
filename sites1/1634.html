  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, open your lips and begin to break all satanic chains in your life -
    <br>chain of affliction, depression, setback - open your lips and begin to break it!
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself - break it right now!
    <br>Negative thoughts, bad habits, weaknesses - begin to break them!
    <br>Whatever weakness satan might have used to connect you - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips, begin to break it; break the chain!
    <br>Break the chain!
    <br>I can see chains broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see chains broken, in the name of Jesus -
    <br>chain of poverty, affliction, depression, stagnation, joblessness, sickness, disease,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>You can know if that chain has been broken!
    <br>God's Word says you can know.
    <br>I can see that chain broken!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
