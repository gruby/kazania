    <br>I remember I visited this place three years ago.
    <br>I was here with the man who was taking me round.
    <br>I saw this place was abandoned and everywhere was bushy and unkept.
    <br>Given the Scriptural significance of this place, I was moved to contact the mayor.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I was moved to contact the mayor to ask his permission to renovate this place.
    <br>We can see - what a beautiful place we are in today!
    <br>Emmanuel TV and partners - this is our contribution.
    <br>This is our contribution to the place where Jesus' father, and His mother, Mary, came from.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Let's take a look at the before and the after.
    <br>I remember I have the record of when I came here three years ago.
    <br>Let's take a look.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>This is the amphitheatre of Mount Precipice, Nazareth.
    <br>Here is T.B. Joshua, taking an inspection tour of the venue.
    <br>A large area of land overgrown with weeds
    <br>which is located just 2 kilometres south-west of the modern city centre.

    <br>Here is T.B. Joshua with the CEO of the municipality of Nazareth.
    <br>We can see T.B. Joshua here with the mayor of Nazareth and the CEO of the municipality.
    <br>This is the amphitheatre before its renovation.
    <br>T.B. Joshua continues his inspection tour throughout the amphitheatre
    <br>at Mount Precipice before it was renovated.
    <br>Cracks and holes in the ground need to be filled and repaired.
    <br>We can see the large amount of renovation that needs to be done.
    <br>The terraces need to be cast with concrete and tiled.
    <br>We can see how difficult it is for T.B. Joshua and the team
    <br>to manoeuver their way through the overgrown terrain,
    <br>land in need of much refurbishment.
    <br>We can see the enormous job that needs to be done
    <br>in preparation for the meeting in Nazareth with T.B. Joshua.

    <br>We can see the debris and severe damage to the walls that are in need of much repair.
    <br>Apart from the large amount of reconstruction required,
    <br>lights and other fixtures also need to be put in place
    <br>before this site can serve as a useful venue.

    <br>The Amphitheatre Before The Renovation
    <br>After the weeds have been cleared and the ground prepared,
    <br>it is time for the main construction work to begin.
    <br>Among the various machines T.B. Joshua hired to achieve this purpose,
    <br>is this asphalt paver machine which will be used to lay asphalt on the roads.
    <br>As the asphalt is being laid, excavator machines are also being used
    <br>for digging and filling in order to prepare the ground for the casting of the concrete
    <br>so as to create spaces for rows and rows of seating for this huge project.
    <br>It is by no means a small task or a one day job,
    <br>with various machines and manpower being used throughout the site of the amphitheatre
    <br>for the reconstruction of the site in preparation for the big event -
    <br>the Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua.
    <br>During The Renovation Of The
    <br>Amphitheatre, Nazareth, Israel
    <br>Recall T.B. Joshua's inspection tour of the amphitheatre on the left.
    <br>God honours men who plan.
    <br>With the help of the Emmanuel TV partners worldwide,
    <br>we can see on the right, T.B. Joshua was able to complete the renovation of the site -
    <br>the venue used for the Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua.
    <br>It is clear to see that not only have the grass and overgrown weed been cleared away,
    <br>but the entire grounds of the amphitheatre have been refurbished -
    <br>from the flooring to the walkways to the seats.
    <br>Even electricity was installed for high powered lighting and other professional audio and video equipment,
    <br>making it a suitable venue for the special event.
    <br>Remember the building T.B. Joshua entered during his inspection tour
    <br>which was in much need of renovation.
    <br>It has been totally overhauled with new freshly painted walls, tiles and furniture.
    <br>This is a far cry from the inhabitable state that T.B. Joshua found it in.
    <br>All this was made possible by the help and contribution of T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>To God be all the glory.
    <br>BEFORE - AFTER
    <br>Renovation Of The Amphitheatre, Nazareth, Israel
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>We can see - what a beautiful place we are in today!
    <br>Emmanuel TV and partners - this is our contribution.
    <br>Today this place can promote the culture, sport, economy, education.
    <br>Just mention.
    <br>Like I have said, Emmanuel TV and partners all over the world - this is our contribution to the land.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>This is just the beginning of our journey to this place.
    <br>I want to advise you: make Nazareth your second home.
