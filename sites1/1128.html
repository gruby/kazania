  <p>    
    <br>Guided and directed by the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer to the people
    <br>who have come from all over the world in need of the saving power, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>For satan's mission is to keep the children of God from the truth, where their true light comes from
    <br>and make them insensitive to God's voice.
    <br>As the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua approaches this lady, every darkness in her life is exposed
    <br>and manifests, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am the spirit of death.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I will kill her.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I entered her when she touched a dead body.
    <br>With just a wave of his hand, Prophet T.B. Joshua, through the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>delivers her, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus’ Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>South Korea
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu; I'm from South Korea.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>South Korea
    <br>I have a ministry; I have been healing, delivering and blessing people for a long time.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We have heard from this sister; she says she is a pastor from Korea, that she is into ministry work,
    <br>that she heals and delivers people.
    <br>She came to The SCOAN because she had the spirit of fear.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said one day she received sad news from the family of her friend,
    <br>that her friend had been brought down with a terrible disease of pancreatic cancer
    <br>and she had only that night to live; at the end of that day she would die.
    <br>She was asked to come and minister prayer to the friend.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>As a prayer minister, she says she has about 30 people that form a prayer team
    <br>and she asked the prayer team, that they should go with her and pray for her sick friend.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said ever before she made that move to go and pray for this sick friend together with her prayer team,
    <br>she heard a voice speaking to her that it would take the soul of that friend.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said she made the move and went to the hospital.
    <br>By the time she got to the hospital, her friend was at the point of death.
    <br>Because her mouth was open, she could sense a bad breath coming from her,
    <br>like a decayed organ.
    <br>This was coming from inside her friend who was lying at the hospital at the point of death.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said she was not happy with the state in which she met her friend at the hospital.
    <br>She spent one hour praying for her sick friend.
    <br>After that she went back home.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>By the time she got back home, she later received the news from the hospital
    <br>that her friend had died that same night.
    <br>She went and took a shower.
    <br>Right in front of her house, there is a sensor-light.
    <br>If a human being is present in the front of the door, the sensor-light would be on.
    <br>Immediately you leave the spot where the sensor-light is located, it is supposed to go off.
    <br>She said that by the time she went into her house, showered and came back in front of her house,
    <br>she detected and noticed that the sensor-light was still on.
    <br>She shouted, "Who is there?", because she believed that somebody must have been there,
    <br>for the sensor-light to still be on.
    <br>She shouted, "Who is there?", but nobody answered her.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Since she had that experience, the spirit of fear entered her because she believed
    <br>that the spirit being which she could not see was following her.
    <br>It was that spirit being that was present in the front of the sensor-light that made that light to be blinking,
    <br>despite the fact that she could not see that being.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that after the death of her friend, one day she was brushing her teeth
    <br>and she was standing in the front of her mirror in her house.
    <br>Rather than seeing her own face in the mirror,
    <br>she saw the face of her dead friend, staring at her from inside the mirror.
    <br>And that evil spirit told her that it was going to kill her the same way it had killed her friend
    <br>with that sickness of pancreatic cancer and also stop her ministry.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that ever since that evil spirit entered her, anytime she stood on the pulpit to preach,
    <br>it was not her preaching, but that evil spirit in her preaching to the congregation.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that ever since this happened, her congregants would tell her,
    <br>"Pastor, anytime you are on the pulpit preaching, we see another spirit being moving
    <br>just at the spot where you are".
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that because of the predicament she found herself in,
    <br>it caused sleepless nights and great discomfort to her.
    <br>She called the prayer team and asked them to pray for her, but despite the ceaseless prayers
    <br>she could find no solution to the problem she was having.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said she used to watch Emmanuel TV right in Korea and she had seen what God had been using
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in the lives of the people; to heal, to deliver and to bless people.
    <br>Not only that; she also witnessed the prophetic message that the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>gave many years ago that there would be a reconciliation between North and South Korea,
    <br>and she has seen that prophecy come to pass.
    <br>All this gave her a great conviction and belief that if she stepped her feet here, at The SCOAN,
    <br>God Almighty would deliver her.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said ever since the evil spirit entered her, it caused disagreements between her and the husband,
    <br>she began to have marital problems and her husband got irritated by any little action she took.
    <br>She began to have negative thoughts towards her husband;
    <br>at some point she even wished her husband was dead.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that as she was seated in the church auditorium last Sunday, and the man of God
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was preaching to the congregants that if you pray for somebody
    <br>without first delivering that person, that means you are inheriting the person's problem.
    <br>That person's problems would definitely come to you.
    <br>She said as she heard that message, she was shocked that the Prophet was talking exactly to her.
    <br>That was exactly the problem she was having and that was the reason why she was at The SCOAN that Sunday.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua was ministering prayer and deliverance to the congregants,
    <br>as he approached her, she wanted to run away but she could not.
    <br>She said she had gone to many churches, undergone many deliverances,
    <br>but she had never felt like that before.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that after the Prophet prayed for her; immediately he laid his hands on her,
    <br>that was all she could remember, until she found herself on the floor.
    <br>By the time she stood up, she felt so light.
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>She said ever since that prayer she has peace in her and she sleeps like a new-born baby.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together louder for Jesus!
    <br>How is she feeling now; is she still having those feelings of somebody following her anywhere she goes?
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>No, nobody is following me.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>Pastor Park Soon Gyu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We have listened to that wonderful advice from our sister who said
    <br>that satan comes to kill, steal and destroy,
    <br>but our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has come to give life, and life in abundance.
    <br>She is advising everyone: That whatever problem or situation you might be facing, run to Jesus
    <br>and He will see you through, because He is the solution to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>We give glory to God for the wonderful deliverance you have received, mum.
    <br>And we just want to advise you that as God Almighty has delivered you and set you free,
    <br>continue to walk in the light of your testimony, making God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>and we know that more and more blessings are still coming your way, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Once again, shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
