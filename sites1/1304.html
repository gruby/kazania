    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>We are going to call most especially those people from other countries
    <br>that have broken homes.
    <br>The reason we listen to them is to strengthen your desire for God,
    <br>to prepare you for the challenges ahead, to keep you for a new level,
    <br>for you to know that with God all things are possible.
    <br>So, when you listen to them, what should be going through your mind is
    <br>‘I need to forgive; I need to be forgiven.’
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>‘I need to forgive; I need to be forgiven.’
    <br>Again.
    <br>‘I need to forgive; I need to be forgiven.’
    <br>My name is Beatrice Nbone, I am from Cameroon.
    <br>The problem that brought me here is that my family accused me of being a witch.
    <br>Five years ago, when my big sister died, they went to a witch doctor.
    <br>When they came back, they said that I was the one that killed her.
    <br>My brother died; they said that I killed him.
    <br>My sister’s daughter died; they said that I was the one that killed her.
    <br>This very year, an eleven months old baby died;
    <br>they said that I was the one who killed him.
    <br>When it was time for the baby’s burial, they said that they must kill me
    <br>because if they left me, I would still kill more people.
    <br>So, they caught me, put me in a room and locked the door
    <br>and sent some boys to go and get petrol to burn me.
    <br>So, suddenly a ‘good Samaritan’ went to call my friend.
    <br>She passed through the back door with some other boys.
    <br>She took me through the back door and ran with me to her house.
    <br>She kept me in her house, we looked for money and she brought me here.
    <br>I beg the man of God to tell the whole of Cameroon if I am a witch or not.
    <br>He should help me because I’ve cried too much.
    <br>I beg the man of God to help me.
    <br>The trouble is too much.
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>I cry every day. I don’t have peace; help me.
    <br>How do you know that they wanted to take petrol and burn you?
    <br>I was listening as they were talking about it.
    <br>A ‘good Samaritan’ called my friend who came with some boys
    <br>and they passed through a back door and rescued me.
    <br>I’m Likambi Anita from Cameroon.
    <br>I am here on behalf of my friend.
    <br>Five years ago, she was accused by the family of being a witch.
    <br>When she lost her senior sister, they went to a witch doctor
    <br>and the witch doctor told them that she was the cause of the death of her sister.
    <br>After that death, the senior brother died.
    <br>They said that it was her again.
    <br>After that, her sister’s daughter died and they said it was her.
    <br>This year, a small baby of eleven months died.
    <br>This one was the worst.
    <br>They decided that it was too much.
    <br>They even said she had a blanket she was using in the witchcraft world.
    <br>I shouldn't be close to her because she would use that blanket to cover my progress.
    <br>So that day that they wanted to bury that small boy,
    <br>they locked her inside a room, sent boys to go and buy petrol
    <br>and said that they would burn her.
    <br>So, I came and took her away to my place.
    <br>When she was crying, I told her not to cry, that the answer is The SCOAN.
    <br>Everybody back home now is watching to hear the man of God say something about this situation.
    <br>If the man of God doesn’t say anything, we cannot go back because they will kill her.
    <br>It is an idol that is fighting the villagers; not this woman.
    <br>This woman is not a witch.
    <br>Man of God, thank you.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>She is not a witch.
    <br>It is the idol that their forefathers worshipped that is fighting.
    <br>But by the time she goes back home with the Anointing Water, the idol will run away.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>The idol uses the appearance of this woman to do all this.
    <br>She is not the one.
    <br>She is a human being just like anyone.
    <br>She is not a witch.
    <br>She is totally innocent.
    <br>I want to pray for everyone in the village that God should forgive them.
    <br>I know they are watching this program and they have honour and respect to God.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is a supreme agent.
    <br>No matter what they might have believed in, they know there is power above.
    <br>I want to thank the sister; the Spirit of God really used you to do the job; very clean job.
    <br>Give the Anointing Water.
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>When you take it, you are set aside for the Lord's attention.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>When you are set aside for the Lord's attention, what happens next -
    <br>you will find yourself under the influence of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>This is the position of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>I am Maria Kambasha, I come from Zimbabwe.
    <br>I am one of the people who has accused my father’s brother,
    <br>my uncle, that he is a wizard.
    <br>After he had a shrine in his home, there were so many deaths in the family.
    <br>Children died, his wife died, his brothers died and my father died.
    <br>So, I went to a witch doctor, and he bathed us -
    <br>me and my family and the other family.
    <br>We were given ropes to tie around our waist for protection.
    <br>I have it here.
    <br>I’ve got the rope under here.
    <br>In 1999, where I was married, there was a wicked brother to my husband.
    <br>He also has a shrine where we believed he drinks people’s blood.
    <br>So, there are deaths often – the 16th of May every year, a man dies.
    <br>Since my husband died in 1999 up until now, we have deaths every 16th of May.
    <br>So, I came here to The SCOAN
    <br>to seek for deliverance of my family.
    <br>I fear death; death is all over.
    <br>I fear for my children.
    <br>I need deliverance so I came here.
    <br>On Monday when the man of God touched us,
    <br>that night, this wicked man came to my dream and asked me, “Why have you gone to T.B. Joshua?”
    <br>I said, “I am afraid.”
    <br>He said, “I did not kill your children.”
    <br>Then I said, “You killed my husband.”
    <br>He said, “After all, that was my brother.”
    <br>Man of God, I am here for deliverance.
    <br>She needs to go back to the family.
    <br>This is why God has given the Anointing Water.
    <br>Any newcomer, a person coming here for the first time - come, sir.
    <br>You just take deliverance out of it and go and minister it.
    <br>What you are going to say,
    <br>I need to forgive; I need to be forgiven.
    <br>Lord, have mercy on me.
    <br>Let your mercy and favour speak for me today, in Jesus' name. Amen.
    <br>After that you spray it...
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>I minister to you in the name of Jesus, the blood of Jesus.
    <br>The Anointing Water for healing and deliverance.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>Down she goes.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Maria from Zimbabwe was delivered after receiving the Anointing Water.
    <br>My name is Philip Mweene from Zambia.
    <br>I am 62 years old.
    <br>I had six daughters and two boys.
    <br>I have accused my elder sister of killing my three daughters.
    <br>What happened was that when they were pregnant and about to give birth,
    <br>the whole body would swell up from head to toe.
    <br>The first one died in 1999.
    <br>As Christians we depended on God and we surrendered the whole issue to God.
    <br>The second one died in 2005 - this one shocked the entire family.
    <br>The entire family forced us to go and look for a witch doctor.
    <br>We went together with the family and the witch doctor pointed out that
    <br>it is my elder sister who was responsible for all these deaths.
    <br>But again in 2008, a third one died in the same way.
    <br>The fourth one, Mary – I’ve got her picture.
    <br>She is pregnant and she is suffering in the same way like the others who have died.
    <br>When we saw this, it annoyed me and the entire family.
    <br>So we organised ourselves and said, “Let us go to a very powerful witch doctor.”
    <br>I sold about eight herds of cattle and the money came to $960.
    <br>While we were contemplating this, well wishers, friends
    <br>and other relatives came to me and said, “Mr Philip,
    <br>you have gone to many witch doctors. This time, why don’t you change this money you have,
    <br>because it can take you to Nigeria to see Prophet T.B. Joshua for this case.
    <br>Then we started to organise the journey.
    <br>They said, “If you go there, you will be delivered,
    <br>the entire family will be delivered and even the one responsible for the deaths will be delivered.
    <br>That is how I myself am here.
    <br>I ask the man of God to help me, to help the family
    <br>because in the family, there is a curse – always dreaming of funerals, of death and so forth.
    <br>The woman they call a witch is not a witch.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>I can't understand the way you people catch witches and wizards.
    <br>You mean that darkness can catch darkness?
    <br>Give the Anointing Water - let her spray it by herself.
    <br>As instructed, she removes the Anointing Water from its box and ministers it to the man.
    <br>In Jesus' name...
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>It worked so powerfully; you need to know what you carry.
    <br>OK, spray it into your mouth.
    <br>She has lost control of herself.
    <br>Down she goes.
    <br>It is something that fights darkness.
    <br>If there is any atom of darkness in your body, it will release you.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Collect it from her and give it to baba.
    <br>Apply it to yourself.
    <br>That is the man from Zambia.
    <br>Down he goes.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>If there is anything satan might have used to connect them to himself, they have been disconnected.
    <br>Now delivered, they are free, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is with us, who can be against us?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you for being part of this broadcast.
    <br>We pray the Lord will give you a hearing heart.
    <br>We shall quickly look at the Word Jesus has for us.
    <br>The title: “Broken Home And Reconciliation”
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Broken Home And Reconciliation
    <br>Viewers all over the world, open with me the Book of Isaiah 11.
    <br>“There shall come forth a Rod from the stem of Jesse,
    <br>and a Branch shall grow out of his roots."
    <br>Verse 2: “The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him,
    <br>the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
    <br>the Spirit of counsel and might,
    <br>the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord."
    <br>Verse 3: “His delight is in the fear of the Lord…”
    <br>That is his joy is in the fear of the Lord.
    <br>When you now look at verse 6:
    <br>“The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb…”
    <br>These are the two that one would not expect.
    <br>For the wolf to dwell with the lamb – this means there is reconciliation.
    <br>Without the Gospel of grace, the wolf cannot dwell with the lamb.
    <br>There are things that just don’t belong together.
    <br>Good example of it is the wolf and the lamb.
    <br>There are things that just don’t belong together:
    <br>light and darkness.
    <br>There are things that just don’t belong together:
    <br>the lion and the deer.
    <br>Broken Home And Reconciliation
    <br>Let someone say.
    <br>Broken Home And Reconciliation
    <br>You see these two things: light and darkness, wolf and lamb, lion and deer;
    <br>they are things that just don't belong together.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>A son will never call his father’s murderer, “Dear friend”.
    <br>There are things that just don’t belong together.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>The Gospel of God’s grace challenges and changes everything.
    <br>To His power nothing is impossible.
    <br>The Gospel of God’s grace challenges and changes everything.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>When you take your time to read the Book of Mark 11 from verse 25 - hear forgiveness.
    <br>Jesus clearly linked faith to forgiveness.
    <br>The reason forgiveness is so important is that
    <br>a relationship does not involve two perfect people.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>There is no such thing as a perfect person.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>There is no such thing as a perfect person.
    <br>Those perfect people don’t exist on this earth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Those perfect people don’t exist on this planet.
    <br>Those perfect people don’t exist on this earth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>Those perfect people don’t exist on this earth.
    <br>There is no such thing as a perfect person.
    <br>Those perfect people don’t exist on this earth.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Let someone say, "Broken Home And Reconciliation".
    <br>People make mistakes, even if you are a Christian, even if you are a pastor.
    <br>Our response to a person who makes mistakes can also be a mistake.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Our response to a person who makes mistakes can also be a mistake, if care is not taken.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Let someone say, "Broken Home And Reconciliation".
    <br>Our concern must be twofold: not only what we do that is in error but also how we respond.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Our concern must be twofold: not only what we do that is in error but also how we respond.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Our concern must be twofold: not only what we do that is in error but also how we respond
    <br>because you need to forgive and you need to be forgiven.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You need to forgive and you need to be forgiven.
    <br>Our response to a person who makes mistakes can also be a mistake.
    <br>Our concern must be twofold: not only what we do that is in error
    <br>but also how we respond -
    <br>because you need to forgive; you need to be forgiven.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>I need to forgive; I need to be forgiven.
    <br>Take to the Book of Galatians 6,
    <br>“Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass,
    <br>you who are spiritual restore such…
    <br>considering yourself lest you also be tempted.”
    <br>If you are spiritual, when someone falls, don’t rejoice - restore.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>If you are spiritual, when someone falls, don’t rejoice - restore.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Let's go to the Book of 1 Peter 4:8.
    <br>“And above all things have fervent love for one another…”
    <br>Wow.
    <br>“And above all things have fervent love for one another…”
    <br>Love does not discuss sin.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Love does not discuss sin.
    <br>You know the meaning of that?
    <br>- Come; do you know - he is a drunkard, I saw him, he doesn't sleep at home.
    <br>- Wow.
    <br>- He is a drunkard.
    <br>Because I have no love, he has no love; that is why he is listening.
    <br>If he had love, he would know that love does not discuss sin.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>If your faith is lifted up, let me see your hand.
    <br>Love does not draw attention to sin.
    <br>It is far from many of us here.
    <br>You say you love but you don't practise love.
    <br>By your action, by your deed, your character - no...
    <br>Love does not discuss sin because you need to forgive and you need to be forgiven.
    <br>As I have said, our response to error, mistake, trouble can also be a mistake.
    <br>When I stand with this man saying, "He is a drunkard", I too am a drunkard - I made a mistake.
    <br>God has written us into an unprecedented and revolutionary story of reconciliation
    <br>in which hostilities are destroyed and enemies become friends.
    <br>Parents play with their children and put their arms around them.
    <br>The generation of vipers shall become a seed of saints.
    <br>You unbelieving generation, how long shall I stay with you?
    <br>How long shall I put up with you?
    <br>Now, bring the boy!
    <br>I mean generation without faith, without hope.
    <br>This generation of vipers shall become a seed of saints.
    <br>Look at the case of Paul.
    <br>When Paul who had persecuted the saints joined himself to them,
    <br>the wolf dwelt with the lamb.
    <br>Man is a wolf to man.
    <br>Man is a lion to man.
    <br>Man is a snake to man.
    <br>When Paul who had persecuted the saints joined himself to them,
    <br>the wolf dwelt with the lamb.
    <br>Man is a wolf to man.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Let someone say,
    <br>Man is a snake to man.
    <br>Man is a lion to man.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>The Gospel of God’s grace challenges and changes everything.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>The Word of God is preached everywhere, but there are right ones.
    <br>This is why I say, the right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>There are messages everywhere - minus miracles in the ministry become philosophers.
    <br>You yourself are a miracle.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>There are many miracles; I can just tell you one.
    <br>You were once a tiny embryo; look at what you have become today.
    <br>A tiny embryo.
    <br>Is that not miracle?
    <br>I am serving the Lord of miracles
    <br>I know yes I know
    <br>I am serving the Lord of miracles
    <br>I know yes I know
    <br>For you to sleep and wake up is a miracle.
    <br>The answer to your prayer is a miracle.
    <br>If you know there is no answer to your prayer, you stop praying.
    <br>Because you know there is an answer to your prayer, that answer is a miracle.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Thank you. I will now come to the end of this message.
    <br>The reason forgiveness is so important is that
    <br>relationship does not involve two perfect people.
    <br>There is no such thing as a perfect person.
    <br>Those perfect people don’t exist on this earth.
    <br>As a Christian, you are living by grace.
    <br>This is what we mean by the Gospel of God's grace challenges and changes everything -
    <br>those things that just don’t belong together -
    <br>where today the lion and the deer will eat straw side by side.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>The wolf and the lamb will lie down together.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>The lion and the calf will eat straw side by side.
    <br>This is the Gospel of God’s grace – challenges and changes everything.
    <br>To His power nothing is impossible.
    <br>Because of who You are
    <br>I give You glory
    <br>Because of who You are
    <br>I give You praise
    <br>Because of who You are
    <br>I will lift my voice and say
    <br>Lord I worship You
    <br>Because of who You are
    <br>I will worship You
    <br>Because of who You are
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated.
    <br>Our response to a person who makes mistakes can also be a mistake.
    <br>Because your response is also a sin.
    <br>Because I told you that love does not discuss sin.
    <br>Love does not draw attention to sin.
    <br>Oh, I love Jesus.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>As from today, our concern must be twofold:
    <br>not only what we do that is in error but also how we respond.
    <br>Say to yourself, "I need to forgive. I need to be forgiven. Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Because the same God that says, "Thou shall not lie", also says, "Thou shall not kill".
    <br>If you have lied, you are also a killer.
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>When you receive the right knowledge of God, you yourself will know that
    <br>victims and perpetrators stand in helpless need of His divine forgiveness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Whether you are a victim or perpetrator, you stand in helpless need of His divine forgiveness.
    <br>Who needs forgiveness?!
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>When you hear this, you will not put yourself in the position of a judge.
    <br>I need to forgive; I need to be forgiven.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I need to forgive; I need to be forgiven.
    <br>Because there is no such thing as a perfect person.
    <br>Those perfect people don't exist on this earth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>You have peace when you hear the knowledge of God.
    <br>You will now know that, "OK, I'm still a friend of God".
    <br>You may be poor and yet be a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>You may be sick in body and yet be a friend of Jesus.
    <br>The way and manner God executes His plan...
    <br>God used a thorn to humble Paul.
    <br>Who knows what God might have used to humble you, to keep you alive;
    <br>it could be disappointment, setback, sickness - God can use any foolish thing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>When you receive this right knowledge, you will not concentrate on your situation;
    <br>the poor will not concentrate on his poverty, while the rich will not concentrate on his wealth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Because a man may be rich and yet be a friend of God,
    <br>a man may be poor and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: The 'WITCH' They Tried To BURN ALIVE!!!
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>Thank you.
