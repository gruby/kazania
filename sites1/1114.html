    <br>I want to believe your hearts are blessed.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>I will start my prayer by praying for those who are still in bondage.
    <br>To all hearts that are in bondage - be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Bondage of unforgiveness - be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Bondage of bitterness, anger, envy, jealousy - be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers at home, viewers all over the world,
    <br>to all hearts that are in bondage - bondage of unforgiveness, envy, jealousy, anger -
    <br>be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes, we can move.
    <br>I want to believe you are free.
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus, for freeing my heart to follow You".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for freeing my heart to follow You.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus!" - you must mean it!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for freeing my heart to follow You.
