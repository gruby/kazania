    <br>SHOULD CHRISTIANS TAKE MEDICATION AFTER PRAYER? | Ask TB Joshua
    <br>TRUST IN GOD
    <br>There are many troubles people are carrying to me.
    <br>You see them; after the prayer they will carry their drug, their tablet and say,
    <br>"Man of God, this is my drug."
    <br>Some will meet me and say, "Will I still use my medicine?".
    <br>After the prayer they will say, "Will I still use my medicine?".
    <br>Write it down:
    <br>IF YOU CANNOT TRUST IN GOD WITH YOUR MEDICINE
    <br>YOU CANNOT TRUST IN GOD WITHOUT YOUR MEDICINE.
    <br>SHOULD CHRISTIANS TAKE MEDICATION AFTER PRAYER? | Ask TB Joshua
    <br>IF YOU CANNOT TRUST IN GOD WITH YOUR MEDICINE
    <br>YOU CANNOT TRUST HIM WITHOUT YOUR MEDICINE.
    <br>GOD HIMSELF IS THE GOD OF NATURE.
    <br>Those medicines are fashioned from plants.
    <br>IF A FARMER CAN TRUST NATURE WITHOUT A DEFINITE PROMISE
    <br>WE CHRISTIANS SHOULD TRUST THE GOD OF NATURE.
    <br>GOD IS GOD OF NATURE.
    <br>FOR AN OPERATION TO BE SUCCESSFUL
    <br>GOD MAKES IT SUCCESSFUL.
    <br>FOR ONE TO HAVE A GOOD TREATMENT
    <br>GOD MAKES IT THUS.
    <br>HE OPENS THE WAY FOR A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION.
    <br>HE OPENS THE WAY FOR A SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT.
    <br>WE TREAT
    <br>GOD HEALS
    <br>DOCTORS TREAT
    <br>GOD HEALS
    <br>SHOULD CHRISTIANS TAKE MEDICATION AFTER PRAYER? | Ask TB Joshua
    <br>He opens the way for a successful operation,
    <br>for a successful treatment.
    <br>HE OPENS DOCTORS' EYES TO GIVE YOU APPROPRIATE TREATMENT.
    <br>He opens their eyes for the rightful treatment.
    <br>If not, they will not see anything. They will not even know how to go about it.
    <br>TABLETS AND MEDICINE ARE NATURE
    <br>AND GOD IS GOD OF NATURE.
    <br>IF YOU CANNOT TRUST IN GOD WITH YOUR MEDICINE
    <br>YOU CANNOT TRUST IN HIM WITHOUT YOUR MEDICINE.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>SHOULD CHRISTIANS TAKE MEDICATION AFTER PRAYER? | Ask TB Joshua
    <br>TRUST IN GOD
