    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is with us, no one can be against us.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated. 
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Wow!
    <br>If God is with you, no one can be against you.
    <br>If God is with me, no one can be against me
    <br>I salute you.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Viewers at home, if God is with you, no one can be against you.
    <br>We salute your faith.
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Ah! Yes! I think you give me some of your time
    <br>before you set up the table for the stomach.
    <br>Because I know you have done a lot, you have wrestled with...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How do you feel, if I just remain silent and quiet,
    <br>looking at your face and you are looking at my face?
    <br>What will be going on in your heart?
    <br>No, no, I will be silent for a while.
    <br>You too, I do not know what you will choose to do.
    <br>But I want to remain silent, looking at you, looking everywhere.
    <br>Tell me how you will feel!
    <br>Do you actually enjoy it if I remain silent, looking at you?
    <br>No!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Do you mean it?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>I just say, let me give you some time to think about all these exercises you have done today,
    <br>and the testimonies you have received today too - you need time to think about them.
    <br>Ah...
    <br>Viewers at home, I know you are trying to remove your plates, arrange the table...
    <br>OK! Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>So today, we shall talk about some very simple issues but they are not simple.
    <br>The challenges we are facing today - we put ourselves where we are not
    <br>when it comes to things of the Spirit.
    <br>If there is any "simplest" Bible than the one we have, I would have asked you to be reading it.
    <br>It is like this Bible seems to be a bit difficult for you to understand,
    <br>because we twist everything; everything about God, we twist it.
    <br>God has no tongue but our tongue to tell you that what you are doing is wrong.
    <br>It is all about this issue of faith.
    <br>I realize that we base our spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.
    <br>We do not know the difference.
    <br>Our spiritual experiences - we base them on feelings and emotions.
    <br>Today, this is what I am saying.
    <br>These are the challenges we are having all over the world today.
    <br>So many churches, prayer houses, you hear the noise of people every day,
    <br>but it is like Heaven does not know or hear.
    <br>- Are you with me?
    <br>- Yes!
    <br>People are men of prayer but perhaps not of faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbor.
    <br>People are men of prayer but perhaps not of faith.
    <br>I cannot hear you!
    <br>People are men of prayer perhaps not of faith.
    <br>In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name...!
    <br>They are men of prayer but perhaps not of faith.
    <br>This means, we are saying words, not praying prayer.
    <br>You know, there is a difference between saying words and praying prayer.
    <br>When you base your spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions,
    <br>you will find yourself saying words not praying prayer.
    <br>Today, people base their spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.
    <br>And we all know that feelings are influenced by what we see, hear, read,
    <br>what our circumstances look like.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Many are not here today because their vehicle's engine knocked.
    <br>And who gave to them that vehicle?
    <br>Many are not here today because they have some assignment, meeting.
    <br>They need to attend the meeting and they have to avoid coming here.
    <br>And God is ONLY, not one of those things.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>You are here today because there is no serious commitment.
    <br>Today is a free day; there is no serious commitment, no job, nothing...
    <br>You cannot just be sitting at home that is why you are here.
    <br>And serious things too can take you out of here, if you receive a phone call concerning your business,
    <br>and you learn that that business is "click",
    <br>you need to receive millions today - you have to walk out of the church.
    <br>Problems arise when feelings and emotions change.
    <br>The SCOAN Sundays Service
    <br>Let's take a look at the Book of John 13:34 as our proof text.
    <br>"A new commandment I give you: Love one another."
    <br>Listen to that!
    <br>"A new commandment I give you: Love one another.
    <br>As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
    <br>By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."
    <br>It means in this case, the Lord is saying: "Love your neighbour",
    <br>and your neighbour can be your enemy,
    <br>can be someone who does not share the same faith with you.
    <br>He says: "Love them".
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>How will you love them without faith?
    <br>Our faith must be stable, must be consistent.
    <br>For faith to be stable and consistent, it must be based on something with more stability
    <br>than our feelings, than our emotions.
    <br>The Word of God - the same yesterday, today and forever and it will continue to be the same.
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>You are not saved because you feel you are saved.
    <br>You are saved because you have put your faith in God's Word and acted on it.
    <br>When you act on the Word, you bring Jesus on the scene instantly.
    <br>Whatever we are doing today, without acting on the Word, we cannot bring Jesus on the scene.
    <br>We continue to shout and shout, "Ah!"
    <br>To realise this, the Word must prevail in our lives.
    <br>You cannot be known as a child of God, as born again unless the Word prevails in your life.
    <br>This is what the Bible says here:
    <br>"By this every one will know that you are my disciples if you love one another".
    <br>You cannot be known as a child of God unless the Word of God prevails.
    <br>For now you are carnal because you are ruled by the senses.
    <br>Because you are ruled by feelings, by emotions,
    <br>you are carnal and to be carnally minded is death.
    <br>Remember, as a child of God, you are a spirit.
    <br>Listen to your spirit and obey it;
    <br>your spirit is controlled by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>But the life we live today, the so called Christian is carnal.
    <br>It has not happened until it happens to you,
    <br>until you see, until you touch, until you hear.
    <br>When others are giving testimony, you say, "Until I give my own testimony, I will not believe."
    <br>When others are giving thanks to God, shouting, "Hallelujah!",
    <br>you are trying to see what happens before you can say, "Hallelujah".
    <br>Many of us are here today to see by yourselves.
    <br>Our circumstances dictate the direction to follow.
    <br>When there is money here, we say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>When there is no money, "Jesus, be cursed!"
    <br>When there is food on the table, we say, "Hallelujah!"
    <br>But when there is no food on the table, "Let Jesus be cursed!"
    <br>This is life depending on senses and feelings.
    <br>You hear noise of prayer everywhere; prayer houses...
    <br>People are praying but perhaps not of faith,
    <br>and only faith pleases God.
    <br>Only faith hears God.
    <br>Only faith reaches God.
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 3:3...
    <br>When the Word has not prevailed, we walk in poverty,
    <br>and our testimony is only of needs and lack.
    <br>When the Word prevails in our lives, we use the knowledge that is given to us in the Word.
    <br>Do not forget, it is the Word that taught us the value of the name, Jesus.
    <br>It is the Word that taught us the authority of the name, Jesus
    <br>and our legal right to use the name, Jesus.
    <br>When the Word prevails in your life, you have what God says you have,
    <br>you can do what God says you can do and you are what God says you are.
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself is, "Am I a child of God?"
    <br>Because the Bible says, you will never be known as a child of God
    <br>if the Word has not prevailed in your life.
    <br>Acting on the Word brings Jesus on the scene.
    <br>Are you a child of God?
    <br>That is a question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>Am I a child of God?
    <br>Question for you to answer.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you a child of God?"
    <br>Are you a child of God?
    <br>That is the question for you to answer.
    <br>I will not ask you; you will answer it on your own.
    <br>Am I a child of God?
    <br>Are you praying prayer or are you saying words?
    <br>FAITH IS NOT A FEELING
    <br>These two; which I believe today, 90% of Christians all over the world are saying words not praying prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service.
    <br>Are you one of the 90%?
    <br>You go to the mountain to pray and fast; praying, praying, praying.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you saying words or praying prayer?"
    <br>I cannot hear you!
    <br>Are you saying words or are you praying prayer?
    <br>If you are saying words, each time you are saying words not praying prayer - attack.
    <br>Don't forget the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>They said, ''In Jesus' name!''
    <br>It is like honey.
    <br>Wherever you drop honey, insects seek.
    <br>Insects.
    <br>When you say, "Jesus!", satan and his demons, "Who is calling the name?"
    <br>It is like a tiger here.
    <br>You will see how you will begin to run.
    <br>They begin to run, "Who is calling the name? By what authority are you calling that name?"
    <br>By the time they know, you have no authority, you have no legal right to call the name "Jesus", they attack you.
    <br>These are the attacks many of you receive today.
    <br>You say, "Jesus!"
    <br>"Eh,eh,eh - that name! Who is calling? Who is calling?"
    <br>They want to know who is calling.
    <br>They will now look - "By what authority?"
    <br>And they realise that you are saying words, not praying prayer.
    <br>They attack you.
    <br>Different attacks you are having today.
    <br>You say you pray - attack.
    <br>You pray - nightmare, because you are not praying, you are saying words.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When that name is pronounced, if the Word prevails in your life, it will show in your posture.
    <br>We can see it in your voice, if you are truly born again.
    <br>When you talk, one will know this is a born again.
    <br>Your posture, your dominion...
    <br>A born again, when a born again is going...
    <br>When you see the dominion, when you see the born again, you will know.
    <br>Many of you look around, just look around - this one is just fat, just tall, just good appearance -
    <br>he is empty for satan.
    <br>In your posture, one can see if you are born again, one can see it in your voice.
    <br>Your dominion, your countenance: "Ah, this is a born again."
    <br>You will see it clearly.
    <br>Satan just looks:
    <br>- Jesus!
    <br>- Hm! This voice is not of a born again.
    <br>That is how they got the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can see it in his posture, in his dominion, in his appearance, in his voice, when a born again talks.
    <br>Jesus - power; power - Jesus.
    <br>Born again - power; power - born again.
    <br>Christian - power; power - Christian. That is it!
    <br>He moves - power; long turn with power; look with power;
    <br>the voice - power; the posture - power; dominion...
    <br>I just have to bring you back to what you have underestimated, belittle.
    <br>The message is for little children, but you are very very little, you are a kindergarden before God,
    <br>because of the things of the spirit.
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>Holy Spirit I look upon You 
    <br>Help me
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>Right now, begin to pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.
    <br>Pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.
    <br>Right now, while you are sitting down, begin...
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.
    <br>Be the Spirit of adoption to me, Holy Spirit!
    <br>Rise up!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service.
    <br>Oh, how I love Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips; begin to pray the character of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Pray the character of the Holy Ghost into your life.
    <br>Oh, how I love Jesus
    <br>Because He first loved me
    <br>Pray the character of the Holy Ghost into your life!
    <br>Be the Spirit of adoption to me!
    <br>Oh how I love Jesus
    <br>Oh how I love Jesus
    <br>Because He first loved me.
    <br>Begin to pray the character of the Holy Ghost into your life.
    <br>Be the Spirit of adoption to me in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>- I cannot hear your voice! 
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>Ask your neighbour: "Where are you?"
    <br>Because some of you are not here.
    <br>Are you here?
    <br>- You, you are here? 
    <br>- Yes!
    <br>We shall know; let us continue!
    <br>If you are not here, let us invite you in.
    <br>I say you have two natures in one person - you and your divine.
    <br>- Hallelujah! 
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>As a Christian, you are not human, you are a spirit.
    <br>You listen to your spirit, obey your spirit because your spirit is under the control of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>Remain quiet.
    <br>Allow yourself...
    <br>Your heart is the contact point; your heart is the prayer room.
    <br>Where is your heart?
    <br>Mean it.
    <br>Whatever you say, mean it!
    <br>Mean it.
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now, ask Him to give you faith to believe.
    <br>You want Him to give you faith to believe.
    <br>Give me faith, Lord, to believe.
    <br>Not "I believe, help my unbelief".
    <br>Give me faith to believe.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>- In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>Every anxiety, depression, downcast,
    <br>worry about now and your future...
    <br>Out!
    <br>You know that cannot happen in the presence of God.
    <br>When you stand before Him and you begin to worry about now and the future - this is torture of satan.
    <br>That is the way satan tortures people.
    <br>You begin to worry.
    <br>With Him all things are possible: Why should you begin to worry about now and your future?
    <br>Leave it for Him; do not worry yourself!
    <br>You need a free spirit now; you want to be free, you want to leave it for Him.
    <br>With Him all things are possible.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name! 
    <br>Amen!
    <br>- I cannot hear you! 
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>- You mean it? 
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Because many "Amen" can come by senses, by feelings...
    <br>Because you hear people saying, "Amen", you say, "Amen".
    <br>That is feeling, that are just senses we are talking about.
    <br>"Ah! The man said I should say 'Amen', I have to say 'Amen'."
    <br>That is not from your heart.
    <br>This is why I ask you if you mean it,
    <br>or you hear people say "Amen", you say, "Amen".
    <br>you see people sitting down, you sit down,
    <br>when I say "Rise up for prayer", you rise up - not that you really mean to rise up.
    <br>You must mean it.
    <br>Whatever you do must come from your heart.
    <br>Our heart is the contact point of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>You must not go by majority but by God's authority.
    <br>When I say, "Rise up for prayer" and you know your spirit does not agree, you sit down.
    <br>When I say "Amen" or "In Jesus' name" and you know your spirit does not agree, don't say "Amen".
    <br>- In Jesus' name!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>- I cannot hear you.
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Viewers at home, thank you wherever you are, whatever you are doing now, I know you are with us.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I know, you are with us.
    <br>Viewers, I know you are with us!
    <br>Distance is not a barrier; you just need God's faith to believe.
    <br>We shall believe that by now, you are there.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Above all powers
    <br>Above all kings
    <br>Above all nature 
    <br>And all created things
    <br>Above all wisdom 
    <br>And all the ways of men
    <br>You were here 
    <br>Before the world began
    <br>Above all kingdoms 
    <br>Above all thrones
    <br>Above all wonders 
    <br>The world has ever known
    <br>Above all wealth 
    <br>And treasures of the earth
    <br>There's no way 
    <br>To measure what You're worth
    <br>Crucified 
    <br>Laid behind a stone
    <br>You lived to die 
    <br>Rejected and alone
    <br>Like a rose 
    <br>Trampled on the ground
    <br>You took the fall 
    <br>And thought of me above all
