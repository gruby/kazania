  <p>    
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I know your faith is lifted up
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: LET LOVE LEAD
    <br>Let someone say, "Let love lead"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's take a look at 1 John 4 : "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits,
    <br>whether they are of God; because many false prophets
    <br>have gone into the world".
    <br>Verse 7: "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God;
    <br>and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God".
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Verse 8: "He who does not love does not know God, for God is love".
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Verse 9, before we go to that verse 16.
    <br>"In this the love of God was manifested towards us
    <br>that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world,
    <br>that we might live through Him".
    <br>Verse 16: "And we have known and believed the love that God has for us.
    <br>God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God in him".
    <br>1 Corinthians 13:13: "There are only three things on this earth that will last:
    <br>Faith, hope and love.
    <br>And the greatest is love".
    <br>Love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Love looks around to see who is in need".
    <br>Remember, we begin to succeed with our lives
    <br>when the problems and hurt of others matters to us.
    <br>The wound of one is the wound of all; the pain of others is the pain of all.
    <br>Love frees me in the present.
    <br>Love frees us in the present.
    <br>Remember, it is the present that presents problems.
    <br>It is only through love we are able to respond to God and to others at present.
    <br>To respond to God,
    <br>first, you must forgive yourself
    <br>and your neighbours and free them in the present.
    <br>This is why Paul, the Apostle, made it clear
    <br>that faith works by love, in Galatians 5:6.
    <br>What a danger is a religion of words if there is no corresponding action!
    <br>You have nothing but a mental assent without action.
    <br>If you give everything you own to the poor but you don't love,
    <br>no matter what you say, no matter what you believe, no matter what you do,
    <br>you are bankrupt without love.
    <br>No matter what you say, no matter what you believe, no matter what you do,
    <br>you are bankrupt without love.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let love lead".
    <br>Love never gives up.
    <br>Love is always there to act.
    <br>No matter what happens, no matter what comes, love is always there to act.
    <br>In the face of persecution, in the face of intimidation, in the face of trials, in the face of temptation,
    <br>love is always there to act.
    <br>Open your lips and say this prayer:
    <br>Lord, give me love enough to overlook the mistakes of others;
    <br>Let me rejoice when others do well.
    <br>Love cares more for others than for self.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Love cares more for others than for self".
    <br>That is love for you.
    <br>Love does not want what it does not have.
    <br>Love is positive; it does not want anything negative.
    <br>Love is good; it does not want anything bad.
    <br>Love does not want hatred because love is love.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let love lead".
    <br>Love does not strut - ego, arrogant.
    <br>Love does not have a swollen head.
    <br>Love stoops - it comes down to the level of everyone.
    <br>Loves does not belittle anyone.
    <br>Love does not look down on others.
    <br>Love does not force itself on others.
    <br>Love puts up with anything.
    <br>This means that love is tolerant. Love is determined.
    <br>Love perseveres for the best which is yet to come.
    <br>Love is God; God is love.
    <br>He that abides in love abides in God and God in him.
    <br>Love looks for the best.
    <br>Love keeps going to the end, no matter the obstacle, no matter the difficulty.
    <br>Above all, if I speak in the tongues of angels but I do not love others,
    <br>I am simply making a noise; talking to the air.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If I speak in the tongues of angels but I do not love others,
    <br>I am simply making a noise."
    <br>If I love others, I will not stand here
    <br>and begin to compare my church to another church.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: LET LOVE LEAD
    <br>If I love others, I will not stand here
    <br>and begin to compare this ministry to another religion, "This is this. That is this".
    <br>That is not my business.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: LET LOVE LEAD
    <br>That is not our business.
    <br>"That man is this". "That man is a pastor". "That man is a devil".
    <br>If I love others, I will not stand here
    <br>and use my pulpit as a platform of judgement.

    <br>Can you see how powerful love is?
    <br>The greatest!
    <br>If I can prophesy the future and understand your mysteries
    <br>or if I know everything or have faith to move mountains
    <br>but I do not love others, I have accomplished nothing in life.
    <br>A person who does not love cannot be entrusted with the power of God.
    <br>Power to heal: because he will be looking for his enemy and his friend.
    <br>Power to deliver: he will be looking for his inlaws and his family to deliver.
    <br>Power to bless: he will be looking for his family to bless.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "A person who does not love cannot be entrusted with the power of God:
    <br>power to heal, power to deliver, power to bless, power to save.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: LET LOVE LEAD
    <br>A person who does not love others cannot be entrusted with the power of God.
    <br>He would misappropriate it, misuse it to hurt himself and others.
    <br>Look at what the Bible says in that book of 
    <br>Galatians 5:6.
    <br>Paul made it clear that faith works by love.
    <br>A person who does not love others cannot be entrusted with the power of God.
    <br>When you have the love of God you will look around you to see who is in need.
    <br>It means that it will be difficult to have millions and trillions in the savings account
    <br>because there are people around you that are crying for a need
    <br>and the best investment is help. Help is the best investment.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you talk and you cannot hear from the Heavenly Father it is as a result of lack of love.
    <br>I pray God will give you the grace to act in the message
    <br>and to do what the message says, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Hallelujah!

    <br>Once again, let love lead.
    <br>If you abide in love, and love abides in you, you abide in God.
    <br>Love never gives up.
    <br>Love is always there to act, no matter what happens, no matter what comes.
