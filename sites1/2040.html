  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Right now, get excited about the rewards.
    <br>HOW TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH GOD'S VOICE! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Yes, about the reward of being in the family of God - it is a great reward.
    <br>The blessing of God is going to flow through you today.
    <br>Hallelujah. You may be seated. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you are welcome; thank you for being part of this programme today.
    <br>Christ and the Word are one - Part 2.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let me take you to the Acts of the Apostles 12, let's look at verse 24.
    <br>"But the Word of God grew and multiplied."
    <br>The Word of God grew and multiplied; that is a seed.
    <br>One thing I want you to know: Knowing facts about Jesus Christ does not change your relationship with Him.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord", "Jesus is this", "Jesus is that", "He's the Saviour, Redeemer, Healer, Deliverer" - does not change your relationship
    <br>because a man can be a Christian by profession and not such in heart.
    <br>A man can be a Christian by confession and not such in heart.
    <br>Take the time to splash around in the Word of God, to absorb it, to discover what the Lord has to say to you each day.
    <br>You are in it - you are here - I am here, but most importantly, God is here.
    <br>What an uncommon sort of book.
    <br>A book, when we read it, it reads us as well.
    <br>At the same time when we are reading it, it is reading us.
    <br>In that verse 24, "But the Word of God grew and multiplied."
    <br>You want to have an appointment with a man - you have the number and get connected -
    <br>but in the case of our Lord, meditation in the Word of God is a visit with Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Meditation in the Word of God is a visit with Him.
    <br>That is, the Word of God becomes a part of one by meditation.
    <br>He is with me in the living Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: He is with us in the living Word.
    <br>Yes, He is with you there; this is why we call the title, "Christ and the Word are one".
    <br>Acts of the Apostles 19 verse 20:
    <br>"So the Word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed."
    <br>The book of Matthew chapter 8 verse 5, also take a look at verse 23.
    <br>The Word on Jesus' lips prevailed over sickness, over disease, in the centurion's servant.
    <br>In verse 6, " 'Lord, my servant is lying at home paralysed, dreadfully tormented.'
    <br>And Jesus said to him, 'I will come and heal him.'
    <br>The centurion answered and said, 'Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof.
    <br>But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.' "
    <br>Faith comes when the Word prevails over thinking processes.
    <br>Verse 23.
    <br>The Word prevailing on Jesus' lips over the law of nature.
    <br>What happened there in verse 23, you should take your time to read.
    <br>He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm.
    <br>That is the Word prevailing.
    <br>And the men marvelled, saying, "What manner of man is this man, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"
    <br>It is not only committing the Word to memory which is valuable but it is letting the Word become an integral part of our being.
    <br>When the Bible says, "In My name you shall cast out demons" - yes, you can cast out demons in His name
    <br>but nothing unless we act on God's Word.
    <br>In Matthew 7 it says, "Ask" and "Knock" - yes, you can ask and you can knock in His name
    <br>but nothing unless we act on God's Word.
    <br>Because Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>This is why in the world today, many will say, "In the name of Jesus, rise and walk; be healed" but nothing happens.
    <br>Nothing will happen unless we act on it.
    <br>I want to encourage you to read your Bible regularly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>Then you can become familiar with the way God speaks and the way we answer God with our lives.
    <br>Listen: Read your Bible with devotion, regularly, repeatedly and attentively
    <br>so that we become familiar with the way and manner God speaks and the way we answer God with our lives.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: He is with me in the living Word.
    <br>Again...
    <br>He is with you in the living Word.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Acts 19 verse 20.
    <br>The Word of God grew in the mind of the people; it gained supremacy over them.
    <br>The Word living in us gets into our blood.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The Word living in us gets into our blood.
    <br>Don't bring what you think you need to hear; this is about what Jesus has to say to you.
    <br>So, the Word of God - the more you read, the more you get familiar with His voice.
    <br>In the beginning there was the Word.
    <br>The Word was with God and the Word was God.
    <br>What a wonderful honour.
    <br>God honoured the human language by calling Jesus the Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: God honoured the human language by calling Jesus the Word.
    <br>The whole universe was created, was brought into being, by the Word.
    <br>A Spirit spoke, "Let there be light".
    <br>A Spirit spoke, the Word became flesh.
    <br>God's Word, a Spirit, creates material things.
    <br>This proves that the Spirit is greater than the material things.
    <br>Once again, Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>Remember, Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>He never said goodbye.
