    <br>Whatever sickness - I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>There is a woman among the Hong Kong visitors - you often bleed through your nose.
    <br>You use some pills; you have some drugs, tablets you use to stop this.
    <br>This has been a family problem.
    <br>I am telling you, it has stopped right now, as I am talking.
    <br>You bleed through your nose.
    <br>You use pills and this has affected your health.
    <br>Right now, God has healed you and it shall be permanent, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Miss Ho Tsang Ki
    <br>Hong Kong
    <br>Her name is Ho Tsang Ki.
    <br>I am the one who used to have nose bleeding.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Man of God, please deliver me today.
    <br>She is the one I said is bleeding through the nose and it is a family problem.
    <br>This has affected the heart and I said today it is over.
    <br>Ok. Thank you.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Ho Tsang Ki. I am from Hong Kong.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied
    <br>that there is a lady among the Hong Kong visitors that is bleeding from the nose.
    <br>So, I came out.
    <br>What the man of God said is true.
    <br>I could not smell and I had difficulty in breathing since I was 6 years old.
    <br>I went to the doctors and they inserted something into my nostril which was very painful.
    <br>Still, there was no solution.
    <br>After the prophecy, I can breathe well and I can smell well. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now, can you share with us:
    <br>What word of advice do you have for people all over the world who are listening to your testimony right now?
    <br>Sometimes, we pray and we don't receive an answer from God immediately.
    <br>Just believe in God; He will heal you.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Amen! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Indeed, God's time is the best. We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>And now that you have received your healing, remember that Jesus Christ is the Healer
    <br>and you have to live your life for Him.
    <br>The only way to live for Jesus, to maintain your healing is to walk by faith,
    <br>making His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will give you the grace to make His Word the standard for your life
    <br>so that your miracle will be permanent, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Mak Wing Kwan.
    <br>She is my friend.
    <br>She had a nose problem for a very long time.
    <br>After the prophecy, she's free now.
    <br>She can breathe and smell well. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah! Clap for Jesus Christ!
