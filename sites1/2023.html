    2023
  </h3>
  <p>    
    <br>Turn your Bible with me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I will take my reading from Genesis 37:23.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colours..."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is the garment of many colours.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Verse 24:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Then they took him and cast him into a pit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And the pit was empty; there was no water in it."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Imagine; no food or any life supporting materials - nothing and nothing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He was in want of everything.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I will take verse 26 because of time.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"So Judah said to his brothers,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>'What profit is there if we kill our brother..."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is: What gain is there if we kill our brother?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is Judah.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Verse 27:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother and our flesh.' "
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Wow.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This will take us to the title:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>COMFORT IN AFFLICTION
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God Almighty often brings good out of evil
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and promotes His purpose, even by the sin of men.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Look at the case of Joseph and his brothers.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>His brothers sold him into slavery, which was a sin on their part.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But the Lord used that situation we see as a sin
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>to reveal His purpose in the life of Joseph in particular
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and Israelites in general.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What a God we have to worship;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>what a Son we have to praise;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>what a future lies before us.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>His brothers' intention was to starve him to death in the pit,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>whereas God's purpose
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>was to use him as an instrument for providing food for his people in times of great famine.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God overruled his brothers' evil designs.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because the Lord Almighty was with him, this comforted him in affliction.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let someone say, "Comfort in affliction."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because He lives I can face tomorrow.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because the Lord was with him, this comforted him in affliction.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It was this awareness that comforted him, while in the dry pit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Awareness that God is with me, "This is not where I belong."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It was this awareness that comforted him, while in slavery, in the house of Potiphar.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It was this awareness that comforted him, while in prison.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let someone say, "Comfort in affliction."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Listen to this:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If God is with you, you will be comforted
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>in whatever situation you find yourself.

    <br>COMFORT in AFFLICTION!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Viewers, those who are under the influence of this telecast:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If God is with you, right there, you will be comforted.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you in the prison?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If the Lord is with you, you will be comforted.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>No matter the situation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I believe your faith is lifted up.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I want to advise you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Listen to this:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Whatever situation you are in now as a Christian, remember,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>God promised to see you through,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>not to keep you away.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Take with me the Psalm 23:4:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I will fear no evil; for you are with me;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>COMFORT in AFFLICTION!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Do you see any statement there that promised to keep you away?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>No! He promised to see you through, not to keep you away.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The question now is:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Is the Lord with you?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you say the Lord is with you,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He will show you a prophetic picture of the future you desire not the future you fear.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If He shows you a prophetic picture of the future you desire,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>your words will reflect that photograph.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You will talk as an overcomer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You will think as an overcomer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You will laugh as a victor not a victim.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It is easy to know those whom God is with.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That was the case with Daniel.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When the decree was published, he was happy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He went to his upper room and said, "Thank You, Lord",
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>whereas there was nothing to be happy about,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>because the Lord had shown him the prophetic picture of his future he desired,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>not the future he feared.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You can be happy whereas there is nothing to be happy about.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your picture of tomorrow will impart a strength
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>to endure your present tribulation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When you turn your Bible to Genesis 37 and read verse 7,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>you will understand what I mean by "prophetic picture".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The Holy Spirit gave Joseph a prophetic picture of his future in a dream.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He saw himself in the position of authority.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He saw others honouring him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>His mind began to change.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You know, I told you that your picture of tomorrow will impart a strength
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>to endure your present tribulation and difficulty.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That affected his behaviour and conduct.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The question:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Is the Lord with you?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If He is, He will show you a prophetic picture of your future you desire,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>not the future you fear.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Rise up and let us open our lips with faith in our hearts.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ask God to comfort you in you situation, as He did Joseph.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ask Him to comfort you in your situation, as He did Joseph.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>COMFORT in AFFLICTION!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>No one can condemn because the life we live is not our own but Christ's.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Anywhere you are...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you here, in the church, or all over the world?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you in the prison yard?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you in isolation?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you in depression?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Whatever unpleasant situation you are in, right now;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>if the Lord is with you, He will comfort you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Right now, I want us to open our lips with faith in our hearts
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and begin to ask God in humility to comfort you in your situation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>As He did Joseph, "Comfort me, Lord!"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Listen.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Those who are under the influence of this telecast;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I want you to remember:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because Joseph was to be a source of freedom for his people,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>he has to taste imprisonment.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Right now, whatever situation you are facing,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>in humility, ask God to use your situation to advance your cause,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>as you move towards the throne of grace.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Use my situation, Lord, to advance my cause.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>COMFORT in AFFLICTION!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Listen.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What is your dry pit?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What is your Potiphar's house?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your present condition - what is it?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What is your dry pit today?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your dry pit could be sickness, poverty, isolation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The question I want to ask you:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How do you handle your situation?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because Joseph was to be a source of freedom for his people,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>he had to taste imprisonment.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Joseph started his journey from his father's house.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Each trouble he encountered advanced his cause.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>From the dry pit - another promotion.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>From the dry pit to the slavery, Potiphar's house - promotion.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>From Potiphar's house to prison; from prison - promotion.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself today:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Has your trouble been advancing your cause?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If the Lord is with you, each trouble is meant to advance your cause.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Our God sometimes uses foolish things to prepare us
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>in the area of mind management,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>in the area of material management,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>in the area of human management and self-control.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Maturity by faith is what we are talking about.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your dry pit could be sickness, poverty, setback, isolation, barrenness.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your prison condition could be any of these foolish things.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The way you handle it matters.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your situation may be to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It may be to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Joseph knew that there was something far more important than the dry pit in his life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Joseph knew that there was something far more important than Potiphar's house.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Joseph knew that there was something far more important than the prison condition.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your dream and goal are far more important.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Say, "There is something far more important than rejection.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There is something far more important than sickness.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There is something far more important than failure -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>my dream and goal in life!"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>COMFORT in AFFLICTION!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When you remember your goal and your dream,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>no matter the situation you are facing,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>you will not look on the outside of your situation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When Joseph was in the dry pit, he asked himself as a man of vision,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Where is my dream? Where is my goal? This is not where I belong."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>His situation looked like evil, but there was no real evil in it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, ask yourself, "Where is my dream?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Where is my goal?"

    <br>The Bible says, as a prime minister he needed to be equipped, he needed to be prepared
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>in the area of material management, human management, resource management and self-control.
    <br>

    <br>Your situation may be to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your situation may be to preserve you for redemption.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your situation may be to strengthen your desire.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Before one's desire can be strengthened for Christ Jesus,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>you must see the cause of losing confidence in man.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When you lose confidence in man, when the miracle finally comes,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>you will appreciate it and you will see reason for it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Listen to the words of encouragement.

    <br>
    <br>Simon Peter, the apostle was one of the greatest apostles in the history of church.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let's go to Luke 5.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We just want to take him from the background - how he started it all.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Luke 5 - I will just read verse 5 for you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"But Simon answered and said to Him,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>'Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.' "
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Peter was to be a blessing to his people.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He had to taste setback.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He had to taste disappointment.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He had to taste poverty - the experience you are having now.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He had to taste setback, poverty, isolation, rejection,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>because he was to be a blessing to his people.

    <br>
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Are you intimidated in some way?

    <br>
    <br>There is something far more important than the situation you are in now.

    <br>ask yourself, "Where is my dream? I know where I belong."

    <br>It may look like evil, but there is no real harm in it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It may look like sickness - it is meant to preserve me, prepare me for the challenges ahead.

    <br>The Bible says, the Lord never promised to keep you away.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He promised to see you through.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What is the problem then?

    <br>
    <br>Each time you are facing an unpleasant situation, you begin to rebel, murmur.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I have given you an answer today.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There will be unpleasant situations, but the Lord promised to see you through.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The only way the Lord can see you through is for you to believe
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>that there is no real evil in it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ask yourself any time you are facing any situation,

    <br>
    <br>begin to laugh as a victor.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Talk like an overcomer, "Where is my dream?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I know where I belong!"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am taking you to the Book of Romans 8.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I will just take that reading - you should be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Verse 35:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>As it is written: 'For Your sake we are killed all day long.' "
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Paul said, "I not only endure them patiently,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am happy when they occur, for Christ's sake."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Paul is saying here, "Look, the tribulation; you lament, cry, rebel, murmur...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I, Paul, I not only endure them patiently, I am happy when they occur, for Christ's sake."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When Jesus is supporting your position,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>you will be comforted in your situation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I want you to lift up your voice and begin to confess it:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When Jesus supports my position,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>there is strength in my weaknesses.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When Jesus supports my position,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>there is comfort in my hardship.

    <br>This is what the Bible says.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It says, when Jesus supports your position, there is strength in your weakness.

    <br>When Jesus supports your position, there is good health in your sickness.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When Jesus supports your position, there is comfort in your hardship.

    <br>When Jesus met Peter at the seaside, Jesus said to him,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Drop your net. I am here to support your position."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is, "Stop confessing failure. I am here to support your position."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Right now, begin to confess:
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am no longer condemned.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past.

    <br>
    <br>open your lips with faith in your heart - prayer in the Spirit.

    <br>
    <br>The requirement of purity must be met.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Sacrifices are to be offered from a pure heart -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>a heart that is pure,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>a heart that does not bear grudges,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>a heart that is humble, sincere, not a rebellious one.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Right now, lift up your voice and begin to ask God to exchange your heart with a pure heart,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>a heart that does not bear grudges, a heart that is simple, humble, sincere, not a rebellious heart.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ask Lord to grant you a heart that is pure,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>a heart that does not bear grudges,

    <br>If you must know breakthrough,
