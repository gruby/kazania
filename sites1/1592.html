  <p>    
    <br>I look like you today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Yes!
    <br>In the Scriptures, when you look around from Genesis to Revelation,
    <br>there are three things that are giving you so much concern
    <br>and you don't know how to deal with it.
    <br>Even sometimes you look at the dictionary,
    <br>even professors when I listen to them delivering a message,
    <br>the use of those words - faith, belief, trust - is quite different from the biblical words, the use of it .
    <br>I think this is giving you so much headache.
    <br>So today we shall talk about faith or belief means trust.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Faith Or Belief Means Trust
    <br>Whether you call it faith or this or that - it all means trust.
    <br>Faith Or Belief Means Trust
    <br>Yes, we shall talk about it today.
    <br>You know, I often used to say:
    <br>There is power in our mouth; the belief in our heart is released by faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[There is power in our mouth; the belief in our heart is released by faith.]
    <br>Can you see that you have the power to say, "Rise and walk,"
    <br>but where is the faith to release the power?
    <br>It is like the money is in the bank and the bank is not open; how will you receive it?
    <br>Or you get home and you want to enter but you finally find that the key is missing.
    <br>You open your bag and start looking for your key because you need the key to open the door
    <br>but the key is missing.
    <br>That key is faith.
    <br>They are all related to two realities - faith, belief, trust.
    <br>They are all related to two realities we cannot see with our natural eyes - to God and to God's Word.
    <br>2 Corinthians 5:7 says:
    <br>We walk by faith, not by sight.
    <br>But today you claim to walk by faith and at the same time walk by sight.
    <br>Whereas if you walk by sight, you don't need faith and if you walk by faith, you don't need sight.
    <br>But you, as a Christian today, you walk by sight and you walk by faith.
    <br>And the Bible says we walk by faith, not by sight; that is the standard of Christianity.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>You walk by faith, not by sight, as a Christian.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>As a Christian - I am talking to Christians - a Christian walks by faith not by sight
    <br>But you, you walk by faith and also walk by sight.
    <br>But Christians walk by faith not by sight.
    <br>This means, if you walk by faith, you do not need to walk by sight
    <br>and if you walk by sight, you do not need to walk by faith.
    <br>But you, you walk by faith and at the same time you walk by sight.
    <br>You are a confused Christian - you don't understand yourself
    <br>This is it.
    <br>This is why today, you want to see God but we cannot always see Him working
    <br>because our faith is not based on what we see but what we believe.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see now: What can you see here?
    <br>A man T.B. Joshua but he is not the man that is here.
    <br>It's not the man that is talking to you
    <br>but what you can see is the man T.B. Joshua.
    <br>But he is not the man that you are seeing that is working
    <br>That shows you claim to walk by faith also walk by sight.
    <br>It's not the man that is here; if this man is the one that is here,
    <br>you come and do what I'm doing because you are a human being like me.
    <br>The natural face, the natural appearance you are seeing is a man putting on blue native.
    <br>Ok, if it's that man that is here, you come and take over.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because if you say you are not walking by sight, ok, tell me who is here.
    <br>Tell me what you are looking at - if you see what is here.
    <br>If you see those who are with me here...
    <br>This appearance is mere camouflage.
    <br>You know camouflage; a soldier puts on a uniform but you don't know the type of soldier he is.
    <br>This is what we should be crying for, not "I am poor. I am sick".
    <br>You are crying for money, crying for this, crying for that.
    <br>No. What you are supposed to cry for is your spiritual life.
    <br>You are in the dark, without direction from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>"Man of God, pray for me."
    <br>Any time can be your best time.
    <br>Without the direction of the Holy Spirit, if I give, I give of myself,
    <br>if I pray, I pray of myself, if I prophesy, I prophesy of myself,
    <br>if I heal, "Be healed," I heal of myself.
    <br>Do you remember the Book of John 7?
    <br>You start reading from verse 2.
    <br>When the brother of Jesus asked him to go to the feast;
    <br>he said to them, "No, this is not time for me to go.
    <br>But any time can be your time".
    <br>You meet a man of God and say, "Man of God, pray for me".
    <br>A man of God needs the direction of the Holy Spirit to pray for you.
    <br>If a man of God prays for you without the direction of the Holy Spirit, he is praying of himself.
    <br>You know you have been reading this verse so much
    <br>but it's like, "What am I saying?
    <br>It's true, this is direction, but I'm going this way."
    <br>You claim to walk by faith, you also claim to walk by sight - front, back.
    <br>This is your Christian life.
    <br>So this is the journey, but your journey
    <br>because you walk by faith, you walk by sight.
    <br>If anybody argues here that, "No, I don't walk by sight, I walk by faith", ok, tell me who is here
    <br>because the man you are looking at cannot do all what you are seeing here.
    <br>All what you see all the time, can never... - he is a human being, it's beyond natural.
    <br>If the man that is talking to you is the same man that you are looking at,
    <br>you would have defeated him; you know the war you have brought against this man,
    <br>right from the beginning of the ministry.
    <br>It's beyond human comprehension.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>We walk by faith, not by sight.
    <br>If we walk by faith, we do not need to walk by sight.
    <br>This is contrary to the natural way of our thinking
    <br>Seeing is believing.
    <br>If you don't see, you don't believe.
    <br>You are here today because you have seen a lot on Emmanuel TV -
    <br>the miracles, the signs; that is your way of approaching God.
    <br>That is why you are here today.
    <br>Seeing is believing.
    <br>This is contrary to our natural way of thinking but the Bible reverses the order.
    <br>First we must believe, then we will see.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We must believe, then we will see the glory.
    <br>I want you to be disturbed right now about your spiritual life.
    <br>"I thought I was a Christian, I thought I was born-again, I thougth I am a great apostle."
    <br>If you thought you were a great Christian, a great apostle
    <br>why are you running out of faith when life becomes difficult?
    <br>True Christians, true believers, never run out of faith when life becomes difficult.
    <br>The same faith that brought them to Jesus, that brought them to God will keep them.
    <br>But I was here, I was supposed to run out of faith, with all what you have done to me.
    <br>You blew my house, you sent me to prison for 13 days.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is nothing you have not done to me
    <br>but I never run out of faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What have they done to you and you are running out of faith?
    <br>The same faith that brought you to the Lord will keep you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's turn our Bible to the Book of John 6.
    <br>"Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea...
    <br>and a great crowd of people followed Him because they saw the signs he had performed
    <br>by healing the sick.
    <br>Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples."
    <br>"Sat down with His disciples" - that's where we are going.
    <br>You are one of the disciples if you say you are a Christian.
    <br>Let's go to verse 47.
    <br>"Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life."
    <br>"Whoever believes in Me has eternal life."
    <br>My prayer is that your response will be to believe in God's Son, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The problem of believing is made simple when we know that it is acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>Thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal, thou shall not lie
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Believing demands action.
    <br>You believe it will not rain, you don't have to carry an umbrella.
    <br>That umbrella nullifies your what? - Your faith.
    <br>You believe you have healed, you have been delivered.
    <br>You now come to me and say, "Man of God, what will I do with this medicine?"
    <br>"Go and chop it."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see? I know where it's going.
    <br>"The man of God said don't use medicine" -
    <br>when medicine is nature and God is God of nature.
    <br>"So don't use medicine" - that is what you want to hear from the man of God.
    <br>Believing demands action, creates action.
    <br>Faith or belief means trust
    <br>while mental assent - to commit the Word to memory - does not act but admires, admits.
    <br>That is, you read your Bible to memorise it.
    <br>Acting on the Word is letting Christ act through you.
    <br>Acting on the Word then gives God an opportunity.
    <br>Acting on the Word brings Jesus to the scene.
    <br>"Jesus!" - and you see Jesus in the Person of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>"Doers", I know doers are here - doers of the Word.
    <br>Let me see your Bible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>I am energised by Jesus.
    <br>You are energised by Jesus as 1 Corinthians 1:30 says:
    <br>I have Jesus as wisdom, as knowledge, as strength.
    <br>The hearer may show some blossom promises but it is the doer that delivers.
    <br>Blossom promises - "Yes, Jesus is Lord. Amen."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is the doer that delivers because they have Jesus as wisdom, they have Jesus as strength,
    <br>they have Jesus as knowledge.
    <br>You say you believe the Bible - that means you are a doer of the Word, not a hearer only.
    <br>If you say you believe God, that means you believe His Word.
    <br>You cannot believe God and not believe His Word because God and His Word are one.
    <br>God does nothing without His Word.
    <br>When you believe God's Word, you should then have no hesitation to also do what His Word says.
    <br>Faith Or Belief Means Trust
    <br>Faith must be lived out daily.
    <br>Faith is the way to please God and obtain His promises.
    <br>You want to please Him - by faith.
    <br>To obtain His promises - by faith.
    <br>It is the way to please God and obtain His promises.
    <br>Every believer needs faith.
    <br>As a house needs a strong foundation to stand the storm,
    <br>every believer needs faith to stand for Jesus.
    <br>If not, you cannot stand the test of time, you cannot stand the trial,
    <br>you cannot stand the temptation, you cannot stand the tribulation.
    <br>And the Bible says, in this world there will be tribulation; cheer up.
    <br>Faith is in the present tense - it believes now, it receives now, it acts now.
    <br>We live in the present and our faith must live and work in the here and now.
    <br>We look to the past for encouragement;
    <br>the pain of the past - what lesson you learnt from it,
    <br>the failure of the past - what lesson you learnt from it,
    <br>your divorce in the past - what lesson you learnt from it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>We look to the past for encouragement:
    <br>the pain of the past - what lesson you learnt from it,
    <br>the failure of the past - what lesson you learnt from it,
    <br>the affliction of the past - what lesson you learnt from it.
    <br>But opposite is the case today - you keep looking at the past to confuse the future.
    <br>We look at the future for hope!
    <br>Jesus did it in the past; He will do it again.
    <br>That is for hope!
    <br>Look, hope, tomorrow, next - look to the future for hope.
    <br>Remember where you are coming from - your antecedent, your track record,
    <br>what you have gone through in the past.
    <br>He did it in the past; He will do it again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The question remains:
    <br>How do we live out our faith?
    <br>When you don't even have faith, how will you answer the question?
    <br>I believe now, your faith is enhanced now.
    <br>How do we live out our faith?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>We live out our faith by trusting that God is working out the answer.
    <br>We live out our faith by trusting that God is working on our behalf.
    <br>Indeed and how?
    <br>By keeping our focus on God instead of the challenges, instead of the circumstances,
    <br>instead of your tribulation, instead of your affliction.
    <br>By keeping our focus on God.
    <br>Don't forget, it is only in the present that we can change the circumstances.
    <br>It is only in the present we can change our situation
    <br>and the life we are now living.
    <br>Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.
    <br>I think I have answered that question for you.
    <br>Think about it.
    <br>How do I live out my faith?
    <br>That is the answer for you.
    <br>There is no better way to answer that, no better way.
    <br>"So now, how will I live out my faith?
    <br>Ok, I have a situation. Let me focus on God."
    <br>Number 2 question:
    <br>What is faith?
    <br>Let's go to work.
    <br>What is faith? Faith is of the heart, not an outward show.
    <br>Our own now, our own faith is outward show.
    <br>Little time you say, "God, you say what?
    <br>I can hear God. Thank You!" - a lie.
    <br>You hear God with your ear?
    <br>No, you cannot hear God with your ear.
    <br>You can only hear God with your heart.
    <br>You say, "God. He is talking to me".
    <br>Some people, when you are talking to them - he is in the spirit, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Faith is of the heart, not an outward show.
    <br>An outward show is anything that does not come from the heart.
    <br>Ok, we have Master's degree holders here, we even have PhD holders among us here.
    <br>If you now ask them a question of kindergarten,
    <br>they may likely not answer it because they have forgotten it.
    <br>Their study is not from the heart, it's from the what?
    <br>First degree, second degree - they forget the first degree.
    <br>Master's degree, PhD - they forget the Master's degree.
    <br>Confirmed professor - they forget the PhD.
    <br>I mean, that is how they grow - study it, drop it.
    <br>But you cannot ever forget anything about faith from your nursery to... -  it's there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If they call many of our PhD holders, even professors for an interview,
    <br>they will now start looking for their children in primary school for revision,
    <br>"Bring your biology, bring your physics, bring it".
    <br>Their primary school book -  they will call  even nursery, kindergarten children.
    <br>"Where is the paper? Bring it to my table." - they want to do revision.
    <br>When they get there, they will ask them, "Equilibrium price - how do you define it?"
    <br>"Which one is equilibrium, I'm a PhD of..."
    <br>Faith is of the heart, not an outward show.
    <br>An outward show is anything that does not come from the heart.
    <br>Whatever comes from your heart will remain there until you leave this world.
    <br>It is simply relying upon God no matter what happens,
    <br>no matter what anyone else thinks or says
    <br>because our faith is not based on what we see but what we believe.
    <br>Don't forget belief.
    <br>From the beginning I said:
    <br>There is power in our mouth; the belief in our heart is released by faith out of our mouth.
    <br>We cannot always see Him working
    <br>because our faith, our belief, is not based on what we see but what we believe.
    <br>Now number 3 question:
    <br>How is the belief formed and strengthened?
    <br>Don't forget: Faith or belief means trust.
    <br>When I say belief, when I say faith, when I say trust, I still mean the same.
    <br>It is formed and strengthened when we hear the truth of God's Word.
    <br>You know when the Holy Spirit speaks, our faith is strengthened, formed.
    <br>If it is the Holy Spirit that is speaking to you now, it enhances your faith, grows your faith.
    <br>But if it is T.B. Joshua that is speaking to you - oh my friend, it's gone,
    <br>nothing to strengthen your faith, to form your faith.
    <br>Today we hear messages that are not from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>A lot of messages we hear because they find it difficult to differentiate this;
    <br>because of speaking skill, ability to inspire, this, that, it is difficult for us.
    <br>A lot of messages we hear today are not from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit speaks, faith is formed and strengthened
    <br>Man has the ability to talk, to preach, to teach.
    <br>"In Jesus' name" - man has the ability to do that.
    <br>"Be healed" - man has the ability to do that.
    <br>"Be delivered" - man has the ability to do that.
    <br>To preach the Gospel - man has the ability to do that.
    <br>But the Holy Spirit Himself preaches, teaches, which is different from the ability of man.
    <br>But when the Holy Spirit preaches and teaches, faith is formed and strengthened.
    <br>There is a difference.
    <br>Everything it seems the Holy Spirit can do, man also tries to do.
    <br>The Holy Spirit prays - man prays; the Holy Spirit preaches - man also preaches.
    <br>This is the confusion in the world today:
    <br>You don't know which one is the Holy Spirit, which one is from God,
    <br>which one is man's doing.
    <br>The Holy Spirit plants churches everywhere.
    <br>Man too can have churches everywhere.
    <br>So the evidence that this is a church of God does not mean,
    <br>when the church is bigger, crowd - it's not an evidence.
    <br>That "Ah, the church is the biggest in the world" - it's not an evidence that it is from God.
    <br>"Ah, the pastor is a good preacher, very very..." - that is not an evidence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The strength of the church is not the crowd,
    <br>it's not the number of membership.
    <br>Question number 4:
    <br>How does faith grow?
    <br>Faith grows when we diligently seek the Lord, studying to show ourselves approved.
    <br>Not just open the Bible and read it like literature, history, biology, physics
    <br>because you are well educated - no.
    <br>To show yourself approved, study to show yourself approved.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>When you read your Bible with forgiveness, faith grows.
    <br>When you pick your Bible to read with forgiveness, faith is formed and strengthened.
    <br>You know this Bible, you know everywhere in the Bible but you are not the Bible, your heart is not the Bible.
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>How does faith grow?
    <br>Faith grows when we diligently seek the Lord, studying to show ourselves approved.
    <br>That is, reading the Bible with forgiveness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What happened? Even if you are right or wrong, read your Bible with forgiveness.
    <br>Faith continues to grow as we take Him at His Word.
    <br>You will begin to think about your shortcoming, where you missed the mark.
    <br>You can know now, "Oh, I missed the mark because I read my Bible with an unforgiving spirit".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I make the Bible work".
    <br>If you are right, your Bible is right.
    <br>That's why we call it Bible, it's not yet Holy Bible.
    <br>It is the person that carries it that makes it holy.
    <br>Make it work! It cannot work by itself.
    <br>Faith or belief means trust.
    <br>His promises give us something to hang onto when life becomes difficult.
    <br>That is why you have to live by faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Every man falls but the wise get back up.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>Every man falls but the wise get back up.
    <br>His promises give us something to hang onto when life becomes unbearable.
    <br>This why you need faith.
    <br>Every believer, every Christian needs faith
    <br>as a house needs a strong foundation to stand the storm.
