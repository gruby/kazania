  <p>    
    <br>During the Sunday service at The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua is used as an instrument of the power of God,
    <br>severing the chains of affliction in people's lives.
    <br>Among those who received their freedom is this young lady.
    <br>As she encounters the light of God, every darkness within her is exposed,
    <br>and the spirit tormenting her begins to confess.
    <br>Who are you?!
    <br>Hatred.
    <br>How many of you are in this body?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am affliction.
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I entered her at the cemetery.
    <br>What have you done to her marriage?
    <br>I killed.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus’ Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>My name is Murtazina Anastasia and I'm from Kazakstan.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>I thank God for all His love and for my deliverance.
    <br>He brought me here and fulfilled His promise which He gave me before.
    <br>I am very thankful to Him.
    <br>God put in my heart that, once I was delivered, my whole family would be delivered.
    <br>So, we thank God.
    <br>We can see you are overcome by what God has done not only in your life but in your entire family.
    <br>Right now we want to hear from you; exactly how this spirit entered your life,
    <br>and what you were delivered from.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The Lord delivered me from the spirit of hatred, generational curses, afflictions and the spirit of lust.
    <br>From childhood, I was told that my grandmother from my father’s side was mentally ill,
    <br>that she walked on the edge of the rooftop and that I resembled her.
    <br>They said it because I was a disobedient child.
    <br>Very often, I witnessed how my mother and grandmother fought and cursed each other.
    <br>I hated it.
    <br>I tried to stop them.
    <br>My sister and I were also doing the same thing because we were living in the same environment.
    <br>We would curse our grandmother, mother and each other because we thought it was a joke.
    <br>When I was six or seven years old, my mother was possessed by the spirit of lust.
    <br>I have two sisters; we are three girls and all of us are from different fathers.
    <br>My mother would often leave us with our grandmother and go out with different men.
    <br>She was busy building her own life.
    <br>My grandmother was addicted to alcohol and would beat us.
    <br>I felt her hatred towards us and weariness was due to her having to take care of us.
    <br>There was a spirit of lust inside of me.
    <br>I remember that my mother loved us very much.
    <br>She would take us for weekends.
    <br>I remember the day I heard her screaming in the night.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I woke up and saw my mother sleeping with a man.
    <br>Then, the spirit of lust entered me. I was eight years old.
    <br>Later on, my mother died due to blood cancer at the age of 41.
    <br>I was 11 or 12 years old.
    <br>My grandmother was yearning for her and a month later, she also died.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>My relatives took us into their care.
    <br>They often blamed me, telling me I was the cause of the death of my mother and grandmother.
    <br>I hated myself and wanted to commit suicide.
    <br>I would take tablets.
    <br>Nobody knew but God kept rescuing me.
    <br>When I was 12 years old, I was given a book to read about ancient Greek mythologies.
    <br>I found out that there were different gods and often identified myself with the goddess Athena -
    <br>the goddess of war and discord.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>There was a lot of hatred inside of me because I was beaten and blamed for their deaths.
    <br>Due to the absence of love, I didn’t feel loved and so I would masturbate a lot.
    <br>I would often cry, blaming my mother for leaving me.
    <br>There were moments when, as a student studying for my diploma,
    <br>I would spend a lot of time on the internet.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I found a book about dedication to the spirits of the elements – water, fire and air.
    <br>I dedicated myself and my entire generation.
    <br>Then, I couldn’t sleep for 10 days but after that,
    <br>I dreamt that a man in a white garment married me; he would come to me and sleep with me.
    <br>Later, at The SCOAN, it was revealed to me that this man was a spirit of fire and dragon.
    <br>I started to speak in different demonic tongues and something tried to strangle me.
    <br>At the same time, I started to spend a lot of time at the cemetery crying, longing for my mum.
    <br>At the cemetery, I was experiencing aggression and anger.
    <br>I was certain that I had left my hair behind on the gravestones of other people.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Later, I broke up with my boyfriend because I wasn’t happy with him.
    <br>I started to visit gay clubs.
    <br>Initially, I thought that it was not normal to have many men but something happened
    <br>which increased my urge to meet with more men.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I started to have different desires and would watch sexual movies on the internet.
    <br>A feeling of guilt smothered me and I later found a magazine in which was written,
    <br>“I will help you in everything”.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I went to visit the place that used that slogan; their teaching was based on cosmo energy.
    <br>I was dedicated to spiritual channels; I desired and chose them.
    <br>They were similar to the myths of ancient Greece.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>They told me that those practices were good.
    <br>They encouraged me to have relationships with many men.
    <br>They told me that it would develop me physically.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>After you were initiated into this cult of cosmo-energy through the internet,
    <br>can you tell us now, what happened to those men that you slept with?
    <br>What happened to their lives?
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I applied these spiritual channels to men.
    <br>Before I got acquainted with cosmo energetic teaching, I didn’t use them.
    <br>The men would all be very unhappy.
    <br>I made them miserable; I would beat them.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>It was a special day when, by chance, I found internet videos about deliverance from evil spirits.
    <br>Initially, something turned inside of me and I didn’t want to see it.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I knew that something was wrong.
    <br>It was not just a simple desire – it was something strange, alien.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I knew it because I was communicating with those spirits.
    <br>I had two dreams about Prophet T.B. Joshua before my trip to The SCOAN.
    <br>He told me that I was free.
    <br>Before coming here, I received a word that once I was delivered,
    <br>my family would be delivered too.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>What was your experience during that deliverance, and how was your life changed?
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I had a huge spirit of fear.
    <br>The spirit in me wanted to hide itself behind people.
    <br>I had a sense that something would come upon me and force me to leave.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua came to me, my teeth started to chatter.
    <br>I clung to a woman and something was crying inside of me; it was not my usual cry.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The evil spirits that were inside of me started to leave, including the spirit of mermaid.
    <br>I also had a vision that a crayfish came out from my leg.
    <br>At that time, there was a lump on my leg that I wanted to be free from.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>She said immediately Prophet T.B. Joshua touched her, the power of the Holy Spirit came on her,
    <br>she saw the spirit of the mermaid leave her, she saw crabs crawling out of her body.
    <br>She said there was a tumour on her ankle before and it disappeared after her deliverance.
    <br>This is the physical manifestation of the deliverance in her life.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Besides that, I suffered from an allergy for 14 years but when I came here to the arena of liberty,
    <br>I was able to smell the flowers and enjoy their scent.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Can you tell us now, how are you now after your deliverance?
    <br>I am happy; I can read my Bible.
    <br>I feel a sense of unity with God, the Father.
    <br>I know that He will always care about me, that I am a daughter of the King.
    <br>I know that through this testimony, I have my crown from Him who delivered me.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>There is nothing impossible for our God, Jesus Christ.
    <br>All glory be to the Lord that He delivered me and my entire family.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Have faith in God; trust in God always, until the end.
    <br>Follow Him.
    <br>I am a living testimony that God is and that He is alive.
    <br>Murtazina Anastasia
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We thank God for your deliverance and we want to encourage you to stay close to Jesus Christ,
    <br>to maintain your wonderful freedom, in Jesus' name.
