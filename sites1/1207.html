    <br>Hallelujah! 
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>BELIEVE AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>How can we believe in order to be filled by the Spirit of God?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>How can I believe in order to be filled?
    <br>Without being filled, you cannot live right.
    <br>It's difficult to live right without being filled.
    <br>And You cannot obey the written Word without being filled.
    <br>Without being filled, it's like you are without a Helper
    <br>because the Holy Spirit  is our Helper
    <br>How can one live without a Helper in times of temptation?
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So, let's take our reading...
    <br>I will take it from the position of faith.
    <br>The Book of Hebrews - let's take our reading - chapter 4.
    <br>"Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands,
    <br>let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.
    <br>For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us just as they did;
    <br>but the message they heard was of no value to them,
    <br>because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.
    <br>Now we who have believed enter that rest , just as God has said..."
    <br>So, let me take you to verse 10.
    <br>...for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his.
    <br>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish
    <br>by following their example of disobedience."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So, that is Hebrew 4; you take your reading from verse 1.
    <br>You also find time to read the book of James 2  from 14 to the end - that will really help.
    <br>The Book of John 16; verse 12 to the end.
    <br>And the Book of John 14 from verse 15 to the end.
    <br>And the Book of John 7 starting your reading from verse 37 to 39.
    <br>We just have to take from the angle of faith.
    <br>BELIEVE AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>Like I have said,
    <br>without being filled, you cannot live right.
    <br>No one can do the work of goodness; God does.
    <br>You can do on your own but for selfish, classic and material reasons.
    <br>No one can do the work of obedience but God does as He wills.
    <br>You can do it, take note of that;
    <br>you can be obedient as a man but for reasons known to you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In that Book of John 7:37-39:
    <br>Jesus said, "If you believe in Me, you will receive the Holy Spirit."
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself: Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask yourself that question.
    <br>You say you are a believer; we agree you are a believer.
    <br>Did you receive the Holy Spirit - when the Father said: 'If you believe in Me,
    <br>you will receive the Holy Spirit'?
    <br>Jesus said, "Those who believe in Me should receive."
    <br>It is His will for every believer to receive, to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit, you can not live right; you can not obey Him.
    <br>The Scripture, the Bible - you can not obey the Bible.
    <br>It's not possible.
    <br>Since morning we have been glorifying His name, we have been singing, reverencing Him.
    <br>The Bible says: Wherever Jesus is glorified, the Holy Spirit comes.
    <br>It means, without being filled, you cannot glorify Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Since morning, you have been dancing.
    <br>I see everyone dancing: "Be glorified!" - fine.
    <br>Wherever Jesus is honoured, the Holy Spirit comes.
    <br>It means, you cannot honour Him without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You cannot reverence Him.
    <br>"Jesus, Jesus!" - you see people crying "Jesus"...
    <br>How will you honour Jesus without the Holy Spirit?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is truth in God's Word.
    <br>Without being filled with the Holy Ghost, you cannot understand that truth.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is healing, deliverance, blessing and salvation in the Bible in God's Word - the Bible you are carrying
    <br>but all these can be unveiled to you, when you are filled with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you are filled with Holy Ghost.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A Christian without being filled with the Holy Ghost is a Christian without a Helper.
    <br>In times of tribulation, no Helper.
    <br>In times of temptation, no Helper.
    <br>In times of trial, no Helper.
    <br>He will not permit the test to be too great.
    <br>To stay with Jesus is to stay with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>That is where our safety lies - tell your neighbour -
    <br>- that is where our safety lies.
    <br>To stay with Jesus is to stay with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>That is where our safety lies.
    <br>In times of temptation, tribulation, crisis - that is where our safety lies.
    <br>Can you see; while you are calling the name of Jesus, and it seems nothing to show?
    <br>You keep complaining; too much stress, too much tension...
    <br>To stay with Jesus is to stay with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>That is where our safety lies.
    <br>When you call Jesus without being filled, you can not see Jesus on the scene.
    <br>So many claim to be Christians;
    <br>many of us claim to be believers - without being filled.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It's a crisis.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It's a crisis."
    <br>You say I'm your father and I am not your father.
    <br>I don't even know you.
    <br>There is no way I can know you without the Holy Ghost.
    <br>But you keep claiming I'm your father.
    <br>There is no way I can be your father without the Holy Ghost.
    <br>You keep saying I'm your father but there is no way I can be your father without Holy Ghost.
    <br>It's a crisis.
    <br>Many Christians today do not know how to believe and express their faith.
    <br>Because the Bible says, there is power in our mouth.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith out of our mouths.
    <br>But many of us today don't know how to believe and express our faith.
    <br>It is simple.
    <br>Faith is expressed through work.
    <br>By this work, faith is perfected.
    <br>Faith without work is dead.
    <br>And what is that work?
    <br>Let me give you one good example:
    <br>After prayer, you believe it is not going to rain and at the same time
    <br>you carry an umbrella along.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>That is a simple example I can give you.
    <br>After you pray, you are about to go to work, and you look at the sky, it seems to be darker,
    <br>as if it's about to rain.
    <br>As a Christian, you pray.
    <br>After prayer, you believe it will not rain.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At the same time, you carry along an umbrella.
    <br>What is that for, as a Christian - the umbrella you carry?
    <br>This puts your faith to question.
    <br>This nullifies your faith.
    <br>This is a form of unbelief.
    <br>In case it rains, you bring out your umbrella.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Inconsistency of your belief makes you to carry an umbrella.
    <br>In case it rains - in case it does not rain.
    <br>But after you have prayed - and God is not a man...
    <br>"I don't know whether it will rain or it's not going to rain."
    <br>Inconsistency of your belief makes you to carry an umbrella along, in case it rains.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God is not a man; only faith pleases Him.
    <br>This means our heart is uneasy and restless.
    <br>This means our heart is what?
    <br>- That is why we carry what? 
    <br>- [Umbrella.]
    <br>This shows that we have not yet believed.
    <br>When one believes, he is at rest.
    <br>When a person believes, he will no longer worry or doubt.
    <br>Even your business; you really show that you are not a Christian.
    <br>There are so many business cards you have - in case this fails, you do this.
    <br>You are a contractor, you are this...
    <br>You even express it in the life of your children:
    <br>First choice, second choice...
    <br>You train them with unbelief.
    <br>If you believe in God in a certain matter, you should have a work of faith in that matter.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>If you believe in God in a certain matter, you should have  work of faith in that matter.
    <br>You believe it will not rain - why do you carry an umbrella?
    <br>That shows that something is wrong with your faith; that shows your faith is false.
    <br>I will take it one by one because I want to lead you to the Spirit of God.
    <br>I just want to carry you there.
    <br>I will carry you by force.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you insist, I know what to do.
    <br>You can resist - I know what to do.
    <br>But I don't want to rush you; I want to take you like Sunday school, kindergarten,
    <br>"A,B,C,D" - next, tomorrow we start from "E,F,G".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know the work of faith now.
    <br>Faith is expressed through work; by this work, faith is perfected.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You pray over some trouble but you are busy planning on your own, worried and full of anxiety,
    <br>as if you have never prayed at all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You pray over some trouble but you are busy planning your own strategy,
    <br>in case that prayer is not answered.
    <br>Strategy: "I bought a ticket, I will go and see a certain person... Witchdoctor..."
    <br>Strategy, tactic; you are busy planning your own strategy.
    <br>Worry and anxiety as if you have never prayed at all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And prayer of faith must be followed by an absolute trust in God
    <br>that He is now working out the answer.
    <br>But the opposite is your case.
    <br>Your issue is a different one, and you want to receive the Holy Spirit...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>Prayer of faith must be followed by an absolute trust in God
    <br>that He is now working out the answer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But opposite is the case.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You attain big anointing, you run after the small anointing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You run into upper anointing, you run into small anointing.
    <br>Tell me why it will not be affected - your life.
    <br>You run to specialist, professor who is specialized on a certain matter.
    <br>After leaving the place, you now run to quack people, those who kill people to treat you again.
    <br>Tell me why this quack thing will not spoil the work of specialist.
    <br>A lot of people have touched you, you are always to be prayed for, you don't know who is praying for you -
    <br>whether he is a religious man, whether he is this, whether he is a spiritualist - a lot of hands.
    <br>After prayer, you have been blessed - a lot of hands will remove those blessings again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Pray for me" - and you don't know who is praying for you -
    <br>whether he is removing the anointing in your life or he is decreasing or multiplying,
    <br>or he is dividing the anointing in your life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why you see people receiving breakthrough, after a while - again downfall.
    <br>Because he is running from one specialist to quack, to those who can divide his life.
    <br>This is life we live today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you knew who is praying for you, you will not want him to pray for you
    <br>because he is going to destroy you.
    <br>And if you know who is praying for you, you will ask him to pray for you and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[Believe and be filled with the Holy Spirit.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Believe and be filled with the Holy Spirit]
    <br>The reason why we have to go through faith is very important - we can't just jump.
    <br>The Bible says in John 7:37-39:
    <br>'If you believe in Me, you will receive the Holy Ghost.'
    <br>If I start there, it will be very difficult for you to understand what I am talking about.
    <br>But the whole thing comes from faith.
    <br>So, we enter through the angle of faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The tablet, the medicine doctor has given you...
    <br>If you don't believe in God with medicine, you cannot believe in God without medicine.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say: "This my tablet, I don't know - whether I should take it. Is it Jesus who wants me to..."
    <br>If you don't believe in God with the tablet, the medicine you have,
    <br>you cannot believe in Him without the tablet.
    <br>The tablet, the medicine is nature - it's mere nature, it was fathomed from the nature, and nature is of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You see, when I say I can't see any Christian - I am only looking at religious people.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>Where is a Christian here?
    <br>Going by the message, where is a Christian?
    <br>So, I need to explain - this is what I have explained today.
    <br>BELIEVE AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>This is a common thing - the issue of umbrella I used is a common thing.
    <br>I mean, there is a Christian here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A Christian without a Helper.
    <br>You need a Helper in times of temptation, tribulation
    <br>because He promised He will not leave us without a Helper.
    <br>So please work on this message - work on it.
    <br>I have given you those texts.
    <br>Begin to work on it - work on it...
    <br>And don't forget about your business of the day:
    <br>Meditation, constant meditation - continue to meditate.
    <br>Don't deceive yourself with prayer, shouting...
    <br>You need to know what would have come if that prayer...
    <br>You have not reached that level of offering, when you stand up and begin to say:
    <br>"In Jesus' name, give me biscuit. Give me bread."
    <br>Do you know the Jesus you are talking to?
    <br>If you know Him, He will reply to you.
    <br>But you always talk and He never talks.
    <br>Your prayer is one sided.
    <br>You always talk in your prayer but you never hear the One you are talking to:
    <br>"Ok, it's alright, don't worry. I will not give you now, so please, the reason why I will not give you
    <br>is because of this, because of that, OK, it's alright"
    <br>before you say "In Jesus' name. Amen."
    <br>But you never hear from Him.
    <br>It's only you that always talk in the prayer, and prayer is two-sided.
    <br>It's what?
    <br>Two-sided conversation - you talk and Jesus talks.
    <br>"In Jesus' name, I need biscuit."
    <br>He will tell you: "OK, that biscuit, don't worry - I will give you not now."
    <br>You can shift your request again: "OK, if you are not giving me biscuit, when are you going to give me, sir?"
    <br>- "OK, I will give you at the right time." 
    <br>- "OK, sir."
    <br>But do you hear from Him?
    <br>But it's you that always talk and talk and talk.
    <br>When someone knock son your door, you open it, you ignore your prayer.
    <br>So, now start from the foundation.
    <br>Don't let us deceive ourselves.
    <br>Meditation now.
    <br>Prepare your heart for God.
    <br>Your heart is not a dwelling place yet.
    <br>You have to prepare your heart.
    <br>There's a conflict between the flesh and spirit; there is a division.
    <br>Go - don't go, for - against, in your heart - a  lot is going on in your heart.
    <br>Get your heart set by meditation,
    <br>hymns, spiritual songs, melodies.
    <br>Get your heart ready; He will soon enter.
    <br>When He enters, you will just see prayer coming naturally.
    <br>It comes - not the one you fashion, not the one you form by yourself.
    <br>You want to pray: "I have a headache, Lord Jesus, can You heal me?"
    <br>As if Jesus does not know that you have headache.
    <br>He is not deaf.
    <br>"I have cancer, heal me, Lord."
    <br>As if He Himself does not know you have cancer.
    <br>Isn't He is your Creator?
    <br>How can your Creator not know you?
    <br>And you are now telling your Creator what you are going through - ignorant.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"I am barren, I have been looking for fruit of the womb, Lord, deliver me".
    <br>How can you believe that God does not know what you are going through?
    <br>You are a clay.
    <br>You are just a pen - a pen used to write.
    <br>But the One that is holding the pen - that is your creator.
    <br>And you - pen that we are using to write.
    <br>How can that pen now be telling the One that is holding it: "Look, I don't have ink inside me.
    <br>I can not write anymore."?
    <br>If you hear from the pen like that you will not drop it and run away?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are Christians without a Helper.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>You are a Christian without a Helper because you are not yet filled.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>If you are not yet filled, you can be a Christian as you proclaim, without a Helper.
    <br>Helper in times of temptation, in times of tribulation.
    <br>He helps us in our struggles.
    <br>He is there in our struggles.
    <br>You are here, you know what I have gone through in this ministry.
    <br>Without that Helper - do you think I can still...
    <br>It's not possible.
    <br>All of you, you know in the past, when you were at home, you were not be able to eat.
    <br>When you were eating, you dropped your food and said:
    <br>"Is that the end of the Synagogue?
    <br>T.B. Joshua - that is the end. What is going to happen next?" Oh my God.
    <br>That Helper you need.
