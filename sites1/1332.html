  <p>    
    <br>Under the influence of the Holy Spirit, the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua conducts the mass prayer in the mighty name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>exposing every demon that was hiding under the shades of darkness,
    <br>causing the oppressed to vomit up all the poisonous substances planted by the devil
    <br>and breaking every chain of bondage, setting the people free.
    <br>See the evil spirit inside this lady cry out.
    <br>Let us hear what it has to say.
    <br>I am her husband.
    <br>What did you make her do?
    <br>Prostitution.
    <br>We are three.
    <br>Who is number 2?
    <br>Dragon.
    <br>Number 3?
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Emmanuella Amana.
    <br>I'm from Adamawa State, the Northern part of Nigeria.
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my lovely mother, Mary.
    <br>First of all, I want to thank God for my deliverance last week Sunday.
    <br>I was two years old when I lost my father.
    <br>My mum remarried when I was 10 years old.
    <br>The man she married was a retired soldier who had children in Lagos.
    <br>The children used to travel to the North to visit their father.
    <br>They saw how their father treated me and didn't like it.
    <br>So, they told me to follow them to Lagos.
    <br>I followed them to Lagos, hoping that they would put me in school
    <br>so I could continue my studies there, not knowing that it was prostitution they wanted me to do in Lagos.
    <br>The lady I was staying with was married to a soldier.
    <br>She had a shop in the canteen, a beer parlour.
    <br>I was 13 years old then; she started giving me to men.
    <br>By then, I didn't use to drink.
    <br>She would force me to drink and told me I would get used to it with time.
    <br>I started with half a bottle and later on proceeded to drinking five or six bottles a day.
    <br>In a day, I would sleep with two or three men.
    <br>If I refused, she would send me out of her house
    <br>and I would beg the neighbours before I could sleep.
    <br>You were at the age of 13 when you were sold into prostitution.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That was how things went until I was 14 years old
    <br>when I got pregnant by one of the men who was sleeping with me.
    <br>She sent me out of her house and told me I should go for an abortion.
    <br>I told her that I was scared, that I had never done that in my life.
    <br>She sent me out of her house.
    <br>I went to the guy I was dating before the pregnancy.
    <br>I told him what had happened and he claimed responsibility for the pregnancy
    <br>and said I should stay with him.
    <br>I started living with him until I gave birth to my first daughter.
    <br>I started going out, drinking, going out with men.
    <br>Sometimes, I would leave my baby at home with my neighbours and go to clubs with my sisters.
    <br>I would follow them to clubs.
    <br>We would drink; they would give me to men.
    <br>That was how things continued.
    <br>I took my daughter and left her father because every time, he would beat me.
    <br>I took my daughter to my mum's place in Adamawa State.
    <br>I returned to Lagos and stayed with my sisters again.
    <br>So you went and abandoned your baby with your mum in Adamawa
    <br>and returned back to Lagos to continue that same lifestyle.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I continued sleeping with men every day - sometimes five or six a day.
    <br>I started dating a soldier - a married man.
    <br>I got pregnant fives times by him and aborted them.
    <br>The sixth one - he told me that he would see small babies in his dream, crying
    <br>and by then, I was pregnant for the sixth time.
    <br>He said I should not abort that one.
    <br>I started staying with him but he was married with four children.
    <br>His workplace posted him to Badagry and we started living together as husband and wife.
    <br>I continued drinking and I would disgrace myself.
    <br>People would question what kind of woman I was.
    <br>When I first started going to the bar, everybody loved me but with my level of drinking,
    <br>people began to hate me.
    <br>Sorry, just give us an example, sister.
    <br>How severe was this drunkenness you are talking about?
    <br>Give us an example - on a daily basis, how much were you taking?
    <br>I would drink one or two crates of beer a day.
    <br>Miss Emmanuella Amana & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I would drink for a week without eating.
    <br>I lost appetite and never used to eat.
    <br>I would cook food but not eat it.
    <br>The soldier said the disgrace was too much and sent me out of his house with my second baby
    <br>and by then, I was pregnant.
    <br>I then went back to the North where I gave birth to my third born - a boy.
    <br>I have two girls and one boy.
    <br>I left the children with my mum.
    <br>My sister called me to come back to Lagos.
    <br>That was how I found myself back in Lagos.
    <br>That time was worse than before
    <br>because I would spend time in the hotels, sleeping with men.
    <br>We were just prostitutes because in the hotel, any girl you would see there was a prostitute.
    <br>So that's how I kept on drinking.
    <br>I became addicted to alcohol and could not do without it for a minute.
    <br>I would start drinking from the morning.
    <br>I stopped drinking beer and started on gin.
    <br>I would finish four or five big bottles a day.
    <br>That's how the thing kept on going.
    <br>Miss Emmanuella Amana & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So we can understand what our sister is talking about.
    <br>From the age of thirteen, she was forcefully introduced to alcohol and prostitution
    <br>and that set the trend for the rest of her life,
    <br>leading to the point that at a very tender age, she had three children
    <br>and was not staying with their fathers.
    <br>At this point, sister, were you going anywhere, maybe in search of a solution
    <br>or to try and acquire powers to be able to continue this kind of prostitution job
    <br>or to get money - just explain what kind of places you went to.
    <br>I would sleep with men and get money but could not use the money for anything.
    <br>I would use it to drink.
    <br>I could not even take care of myself or send money to my mum.
    <br>I started going to churches for deliverance. That did not work.
    <br>My problem would rather intensify.
    <br>I started to follow my sister to a native doctor's house.
    <br>I wanted to make money believing that maybe it would take away the drinking and other problems.
    <br>That was why I started going to native doctors' houses with my sister.
    <br>My sister told me about a place in Kebbi State, Nigeria where they used to serve a god -
    <br>a crocodile of about 500 years old.
    <br>I found myself there because I needed money.
    <br>I went there.
    <br>I didn't even know anybody there but I started asking questions
    <br>until I found someone who could direct me to the place.
    <br>I got there and met the men there who were a hundred years old
    <br>and could not even walk on their own.
    <br>They asked me what my problem was and I told them that I needed money.
    <br>They told me to buy a fowl and some other things; they then took me to their shrine.
    <br>Before getting to their shrine, they told me to take off my shoes, shirt and bra.
    <br>The only thing that they left me with was my trousers.
    <br>I then entered the shrine.
    <br>Some people were there before me.
    <br>So, the man I followed there,
    <br>the one who was serving the crocodile said I should sit and wait.
    <br>When I entered the shrine, I saw one big crocodile with its mouth wide open.
    <br>I thought it was dead but then I saw the eyes of the crocodile move.
    <br>I saw that it was alive but I was not afraid.
    <br>I sat, folded my arms and covered my breasts.
    <br>The old man then told me to remove my hands and be free.
    <br>I agreed since I believed I would get money.
    <br>That was how I was sitting.
    <br>Within about three seconds, it was like, I was blind but then able to see -
    <br>everywhere in that forest were crocodiles.
    <br>I saw more than 100 crocodiles there.
    <br>There was a river surrounding the shrine.
    <br>Crocodiles were coming out of the river,
    <br>while some were going in, even some were passing my legs.
    <br>The man asked me if I was afraid and I told him that I wasn't.
    <br>After they finished with the lady before me, they called me.
    <br>I went to the crocodile.
    <br>I was asked my name and I told the man.
    <br>The man spoke a certain dialect with the crocodile which I didn't understand.
    <br>He would say, "This is what the master said..." - that what did I want.
    <br>I then told him that I wanted money.
    <br>He said, "Okay, no problem".
    <br>He asked me if I had the money, what I would bring him in return.
    <br>I told him that I would bring a goat.
    <br>He collected the fowl from me,
    <br>used his hand to cut the fowl's head and threw it into the river.
    <br>The fowl did not even touch the water before I saw big crocodiles, like 10 of me,
    <br>just like a cow, come up from the water, grab the fowl and go back into the water.
    <br>I thought I was dreaming and asked myself if they were crocodiles, cows or something else.
    <br>The man then went to the river, took a calabash and used it to fetch water and gave me to drink.
    <br>The remaining water, he said I should use it to bathe, which I did.
    <br>I left there.
    <br>When I saw my sister, I told her what I had done.
    <br>One, two weeks passed and I didn't see any money.
    <br>Things became worse.
    <br>I began to see crocodiles, pythons, dragons and different kinds of animals in my dreams.
    <br>That was how I started seeking for solution...
    <br>So after your encounter at this shrine where they worship crocodiles,
    <br>it was immediately after then, you began to see crocodiles in your dreams.
    <br>And what you went there for never materialised.
    <br>You never saw the money you went there for.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I decided that since they didn't want to give me money, I would continue with what I was doing.
    <br>My sister agreed with me.
    <br>That was how we kept on going.
    <br>Things became much worse; I would drink and disgrace myself.
    <br>The people on my street would laugh at me and call me different names, like drunkard.
    <br>Even my sister who taught me how to drink started calling me names.
    <br>I started fasting and praying.
    <br>My mum didn't even know anything about what I was doing.
    <br>Whenever she asked me, I would lie to her that I was working and boast I was this and that.
    <br>So at this point, sister, how did you come to be at The SCOAN
    <br>as we saw you receive your deliverance last week?
    <br>Last week, on Friday before coming to the church on Sunday, I went to a club with my sisters.
    <br>I got drunk, came back home and decided to sleep.
    <br>When I went to sleep, I heard a voice saying, "The SCOAN".
    <br>I thought, "What business do I have with T.B. Joshua's church?"
    <br>I went back to sleep.
    <br>The voice kept on talking as if I was seeing the person.
    <br>The voice came with more power and became louder,
    <br>telling me to stand up and come to The SCOAN.
    <br>That was how I found myself here.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Last week during the mass prayer section, we saw on the clips earlier
    <br>how that evil spirit, the spirit of crocodile, dragon and spiritual husband
    <br>that had pushed you into such an atrocious lifestyle was exposed.
    <br>Tell us your own experience.
    <br>When the prayer was going on, what happened to you at that moment?
    <br>All that I can remember is that I was sitting at the back -
    <br>I don't know what happened; something just moved me.
    <br>I just found myself at the front.
    <br>That's all I can remember.
    <br>Ok, sister. Now to the glory of God, ever since your deliverance,
    <br>what can you say about your lifestyle and the changes you have witnessed in this short period?
    <br>After my deliverance...
    <br>I didn't even use to sleep because of the nightmares.
    <br>I would see different kind of things - scorpions, pythons.
    <br>I would even be in the midst of them - only me as a human being.
    <br>But after my deliverance, I sleep like a baby.
    <br>This urge of drinking, when I am going to church or going out to eat and I see people drinking,
    <br>I feel like stopping and preaching to them.
    <br>Miss Emmanuella Amana
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I feel light.
    <br>Before, there was something in me.
    <br>I was heavy before but now, I feel light.
    <br>Since my deliverance, no men have called me on my phone.
    <br>Even the Saturday before coming to church, people invited me to go clubbing.
    <br>My sister called when I was in church before my deliverance, asking where I was.
    <br>I told her that I was in church.
    <br>She criticised me and said that I was missing out.
    <br>She told me some important people had come from Abuja who wished to see me.
    <br>I told her that they should not disturb me, that I was in church.
    <br>No man has called my phone since my deliverance.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean to say, sister, that for the first time in more than eleven years
    <br>that you have been addicted to alcohol, since the tender age of 13,
    <br>this week, you have not taken any alcohol.
    <br>Never.
    <br>I have not.
    <br>I don't even have the urge to take it.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>You said that even just the week before you came,
    <br>you were still into this lifestyle of prostitution.
    <br>You mean that since your deliverance, you have stopped that life. You are no longer...
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Wow. We give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Truly, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Sister, at a young age, you have seen so much in life.
    <br>You have seen the very reality of this kind of lifestyle you were living before -
    <br>a lifestyle surrounded by drunkenness, lust, clubbing, every evil imaginable.
    <br>Now that you are here as a living testimony,
    <br>what do you want to advise our viewers all over the world,
    <br>especially those that are still living that kind of life you were once living?
    <br>My advice to the viewers all over the world, especially to those who are doing what I did,
    <br>run to God because life without Christ is not life.
    <br>It is now I know I am living a life because I can read my Bible, pray
    <br>and even preach to people now.
    <br>I don't even know how it started coming.
    <br>They should please come to God.
    <br>Clubbing, drinking, womanising and all that, is not going to solve the problem.
    <br>It will just be adding more to your problem.
    <br>It will destroy your life.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We have heard it all from our sister. We just want to hear a final word from her mother.
    <br>My name is Mrs Mary. I am living in Adamawa.
    <br>I came to Lagos to see what my daugther was doing here.
    <br>Since she left the house, I hadn't seen her.
    <br>She left me with small children and I suffered with them.
    <br>I'm selling leaves, firewood, everything to take care of the small children
    <br>that she left with me.
    <br>The man of God called me and asked if I could come and see the miracle of Jesus,
    <br>what God had done for my daughter at The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>That is why I travelled from Adamawa to Lagos to see what God has done for my daughter.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord! Thank you, Man of God!
    <br>Thank you, T.B. Joshua, for my daughter.
    <br>Man of God, now she is healed!
    <br>Nothing will touch her, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Our mother travelled a long distance, far from the North of Nigeria,
    <br>from Adamawa State, just to witness this wonderful testimony.
    <br>And we can imagine: She had to take care of these three young children
    <br>bearing all of the burdens and we thank God today,
    <br>Jesus Christ has finally come into this matter and set her daughter free.
    <br>We thank God for this deliverance, sister.
    <br>We pray that God will give you the grace to maintain the wonderful deliverance you have received
    <br>and make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and we know that as you receive from Jesus Christ, 
    <br>He will continue to support you in your new life in Christ Jesus, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Shortly afterwards, Miss Emmanuella came back with her mother
    <br>to testify to the goodness of God in their lives.
    <br>Let's listen to them.
    <br>We welcome you to The SCOAN, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Please tell us your name and of the person standing next to you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Emmanuella Amana.
    <br>I'm from Adamawa State.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my lovely mum, Mary.
    <br>Since your deliverance last week Sunday,
    <br>tell us - what are the changes you have received here.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I can sleep very well. I sleep like a baby.
    <br>I don't have nightmares anymore.
    <br>I even preach to people. I am happy.
    <br>I am just like a newborn baby, now.
    <br>What about the urge to smoke, drink alcohol, sleep with men?
    <br>What do you experience?
    <br>I don't have it.
    <br>I even sit down and imagine, "Was I doing all this?"
    <br>Was I the one who used to drink and not be able to do without it?
    <br>I don't have the urge anymore.
    <br>To God be the glory. So you mean, you are completely delivered, completely free?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That is great. Let's hear a word from your mum too.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I see the change.
    <br>My daughter has changed and she is alright now.
    <br>I am happy to see her today like this.
    <br>And we believe that what God Almighty starts, He always finishes.
    <br>As He has started this wonderful transformation in your life,
    <br>we know that the end has not yet come; better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.
    <br>What is the next step you want to take in life now -
    <br>now that you are delivered, now that you are free?
    <br>I want to start a business, to take care of myself, my mother and my kids.
    <br>We know that this problem has really grounded your life and you have no other place to turn to.
    <br>On behalf of the Emmanuel TV partners and Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>it is our privilege to present to you the sum of 150,000 Naira
    <br>to start up your new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>All that I have to say is for God to bless the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>to keep him alive, to add more years to his life, more knowledge and understanding, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I feel happy. I feel joy.
    <br>We can see that, truly, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed
    <br>and our sister is weeping tears of joy.
    <br>She never believed that she could live a life of peace, security and comfort
    <br>and this is what Jesus has used this ministry to bring into her life.
    <br>We encourage you: You are delivered by the Word of God
    <br>and your deliverance shall remain permanent.
    <br>So now, continue to make our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ the Lord of all your days,
    <br>make God's Word the standard for your life, home and family,
    <br>and raise your children up in the way in the Lord and it shall be well with you all, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen! Emmanuel!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
