    <br>REVELATION
    <br>TAKE NOTE
    <br>2020: THE YEAR OF HUMILITY
    <br>PROPHET TB JOSHUA
    <br>The Director of the US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), Dr. Robert Redfield
    <br>has just released a statement concurring with the prophecy of 2020
    <br>from Prophet T.B. Joshua concerning humility.
    <br>He made this statement as he testified before the US Senate Judiciary Committee.
    <br>Don't forget, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Ghebreysus
    <br>also gave the same statement about humility, as did Chief Justice of the USA, John Roberts.
    <br>Let us listen to them.
    <br>We are going to probably spend close to 7 trillion dollars because of one little virus that came.
    <br>We have all done the best that we can do to tackle this virus.
    <br>The reality is that it has brought this nation to its knees.
    <br>For all the economic, military and technological might of nations,
    <br>we have been humbled by this very small microbe.
    <br>If this virus is teaching us anything, it is humility - time for humility.
    <br>Six months ago, it would have been inconceivable to most that the world's biggest cities
    <br>would fall eerily quiet; that shops, restaurants, schools and workplaces would be closed;
    <br>that global travel would grind to a standstill; that simply shaking hands could be life-threatening.
    <br>Members of the Westminster Class of 2020, congratulations.
    <br>I think the pandemic is the world's way of saying to mankind, "You are not in charge."
    <br>The pandemic has pierced our illusion of certainty and control.
    <br>There are three things you might want to focus on to meet that challenge:
    <br>The first is humility - the pandemic should teach us at least that.
    <br>This is what Prophet T.B. Joshua had warned the world about for over a decade.
    <br>Let us listen to his prophecies in 2008 and 2011 on the crisis to come
    <br>that would bring the world to its knees in humility.
    <br>REVELATION
    <br>TAKE NOTE
    <br>There will be economic crisis.
    <br>You are to cut your coat according to your size.
    <br>Those of you that have surplus - whatever you can do now to live moderate...
    <br>The only way you can be saved - if your treasure is in the hands of God.
    <br>There will be economic crisis - it's coming and it's everywhere.
    <br>You will be forced to be humble.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You will be forced to be humble."
    <br>I'm just telling you long time prophecy, not immediate - what you can begin to prepare yourself for now.
    <br>I said to you there would be economic crisis.
    <br>The war the whole world will face is economic war.
    <br>You will see every nation, every country will come out, going on the street, protesting.
    <br>You have not seen anything - write it down.
    <br>Everyone will be humbled.
    <br>Those who rely on oil, mineral resources - they should look beyond
    <br>because there will not even be enough money to buy oil.
    <br>There is something God wants to achieve concerning this.
    <br>God wants to achieve humility to the core.
    <br>He wants everybody to be on their knees, every nation to be on their knees.
    <br>After that, the solution will come.
    <br>That is what God wants to achieve.
    <br>The reality is that it has brought this nation to its knees.
    <br>If this virus is teaching us anything, it is humility - time for humility.
    <br>The first is humility - the pandemic should teach us at least that.
    <br>On December 28th 2019, when the fulfilment of these prophecies was imminent,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua declared that 2020 would be the Year of Humility.
    <br>Let us listen to the prophecy.
    <br>PROPHECY FOR 2020
    <br>PROPHET TB JOSHUA
    <br>THESE PROPHECIES WERE RELEASED ON 28 DECEMBER 2019
    <br>BUT MADE AVAILABLE ON 5 JANUARY 2020
    <br>This year will be a year of HUMILITY.
    <br>This year, the Lord will humble us with our challenges.
    <br>Challenges can be affliction, arrogance, pride, wickedness or bad habits.
    <br>To humble us with these is for those things to destroy us or expose us.
    <br>Let us move closer to God.
    <br>There is something God wants to achieve concerning this.
    <br>God wants to achieve humility to the core.
