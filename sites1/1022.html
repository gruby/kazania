  <p>    
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Hezron Konlan.
    <br>The gentleman beside me is Laar Joshua. He is my closest friend.
    <br>People of God, I am here to share my experience of my encounter the first time I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I saw an angel, people of God!
    <br>As am speaking, I believe they are here in our midst.
    <br>You all should believe that the problems you carried to the church would be dropped here.
    <br>It doesn't matter whether you are touched or not.
    <br> Believe it.
    <br>The man of God said something which I believed.
    <br>He said that you don't have to wait until you are touched by him.
    <br>Your problem is known; once you are here, you are free.
    <br>Once you are here, your past is over.
    <br>As he said that, my faith was lifted up.
    <br>I believed in what he said because I had watched him and I know who he is.
    <br>Throughout that day, I meditated on that message and prayed over it.
    <br>I was here with my problem but I couldn't enter the church.
    <br>I sat at the overflow congregation, outside here.
    <br>At the end of the church service that day, we all went home.
    <br>The following day, I was in a bus opposite the main entrance of The SCOAN -
    <br>there is a car station just opposite the entrance -
    <br>waiting for the driver and other people to load the goods in the car.
    <br>Then, I was a bit curious and said, "God, I know You are here,
    <br>I know You have touched me, I know I am blessed.
    <br>But I need an evidence, show me an evidence that The SCOAN is a real place, you are present here
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua is a real man of God.
    <br>I need an evidence - reveal to me that you are here".
    <br>After saying that, I got a direction to take my phone and turn on the video.
    <br>I turned on the video and started videotaping.
    <br>I didn't know what I was videoing because I was not videoing any specific object.
    <br>I just had the direction that I would see evidence.
    <br>So, I started videoing.
    <br>In doing that, all of a sudden, I saw an angel dressed in a white gown,
    <br>seated on a huge animal which I would say is like a horse.
    <br>It was very huge.
    <br>The angel crossed from the other side of the road and then entered the main church.
    <br>I was with my friend here. I turned to him and said, "Charlie, I have seen something.
    <br>Charlie, I saw an angel and it was real, physical".
    <br>Then, I opened the video and showed him.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>People of God, at this point, we want you to watch the screen of your television.
    <br>We are going to show you the very clip that our brother captured on his phone,
    <br>that day he came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Let's watch the screen of our television right now and see what happened.
    <br>He is the very brother who took this video in question and he is here to share this experience.
    <br>Let's watch our screen.
    <br>Charlie, I saw something.
    <br>This one - physical.
    <br>Charlie, I saw something physically.
    <br>It went into the Church.
    <br>Viewers and those present here, the reason we are bringing this to your attention is that
    <br>several months ago, in early January 2018, this clip was discovered on the internet and
    <br>as many of you may have known, the clip subsequently went viral,
    <br>was shared around the world and viewed thousands of times.
    <br>We did not actually know the person that took this video footage.
    <br>We had no knowledge of this gentleman that took this footage.
    <br>We were actually looking for the person concerned
    <br>so that he would be able to come and tell us what he saw that day.
    <br>To the glory of God, after this footage went viral on the internet,
    <br>our brother from Ghana came forward and said he was the one
    <br>and even showed us the original footage that he took on his phone that day,
    <br>concerning this clip that we have watched.
    <br>Once again, this is the reason we are bringing it to your attention
    <br>so that he can be in the position to explain himself, what he saw that day,
    <br>the prayer he offered, and the reason he was actually holding a phone to take a video
    <br>outside of The SCOAN and this incident was captured to the glory of God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Finally, brother, what is your advice to people around the world, after this encounter with Jesus?
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My advice to those who are watching me here and those viewing me on television is that
    <br>all you need to do is to believe, distance is not a barrier as Prophet T.B. Joshua always says.
    <br>Since that encounter, my life has never been the same again.
    <br>I didn't meet Prophet T.B. Joshua, he didn't touch me, and I didn't even enter the church.
    <br>But my life changed.
    <br>I have been moved from where I was to a different person today.
    <br>So, believe in the existence of God at The SCOAN,
    <br>angels are present here, they are touching everyone.
    <br>Release your problems to them and you will be free.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I am Joshua Laar from Ghana.
    <br>The man beside me is my closest friend.
    <br>If there was another word to use, I wouldn't have used the word 'friend'.
    <br>He's beyond a friend.
    <br>Like he rightly said, on that faithful day when we came, I was inside the bus with him.
    <br>When he was videoing, I was there.
    <br>I was there, I saw whatever happened.
    <br>After videoing it, he showed it to me.
    <br>When I saw it, it served as a motivator to me.
    <br>What he said to me was that, "Jo, look at this". Then, he showed it me.
    <br>When I saw it, I said, "Ah, let me see it again!"
    <br>I wanted to know what it was. I watched and paused, and then I realised that it was an angel.
    <br>It was then that he said to me that, "Joshua, we have a living God".
    <br>Since then, we have been planning to come to The SCOAN and give a testimony.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
