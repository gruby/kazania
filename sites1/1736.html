    <br>PRAY AGAINST A TERRORIST ATTACK
    <br>IN GERMANY
    <br>On Thursday, the 28th of March 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua released a prophecy
    <br>about the nation of Germany on his official Facebook page.
    <br>This is what he said.
    <br>Pray against an imminent terrorist attack in Germany.
    <br>Good morning, my viewers all over the world.
    <br>I want you to join me in praying against an imminent terrorist attack in the nation of Germany,
    <br>particularly Thursday and throughout this week.
    <br>I am saying this because I have seen it three to four times in a vision.
    <br>I was supposed to mention this during the last Sunday service,
    <br>but I thought it was something I could pray for on my own.
    <br>However, the vision continues repeating.
    <br>The Government and people of Germany should be vigilant and guard against this.
    <br>It is very imminent.
    <br>We are on our knees praying for the nation and people of Germany."
    <br>Three days later, on Sunday, 31st March 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke further
    <br>regarding the vision he had seen about the nation of Germany.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>I want to thank the world and I want to thank the viewers.
    <br>Last Thursday, I was just in a trance.
    <br>The Spirit of God was telling me, "Pray for this country, pray for this country".
    <br>It has been...
    <br>Not only that Thursday - for the past three weeks it has been like that.
    <br>I pray for the nation, Germany.
    <br>God said, "Pray, pray, pray".
    <br>It's not this kind of prayer where you state your prayer point
    <br>but the prayer that just comes.
    <br>Pray for Germany.
    <br>For the past three weeks, I kept praying.
    <br>But Thursday, He said, "Say it to the whole world
    <br>to join you in prayer to avert whatever attack".
    <br>I think it's on YouTube and everywhere but we are on it.
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>I want to thank the whole world, the viewers all over the world;
    <br>I saw the response - prayer everywhere.
    <br>Thank you for your prayer but it's not yet over.
    <br>We continue to pray.
    <br>Continue to pray.
    <br>But what we are seeing, unless it is unchangeable,
    <br>your prayer is mighty!
    <br>The whole world is praying; we are praying.
    <br>Thank you.
