    <br>"I AM A MAN AGAIN!"
    <br>Mario Anibal Gimenez was born a man, but lived almost his entire life as a woman.
    <br>He even surgically implanted silicone breasts and pumped himself with female hormones
    <br>as his transsexual lifestyle took him across South America, having relationships with different men.
    <br>When Prophet TB Joshua visited the nation of Paraguay in August 2017, this is what happened when they met.
    <br>I want to be normal again
    <br>because I want to be delivered.
    <br>Man of God, help me. I want to be normal again.
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>Man of God, help me to be a man again!
    <br>I want to be a man again.
    <br>Man of God, help me. Deliver me.
    <br>I want to be like a man again.
    <br>I want to be normal again.
    <br>Set Free, In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!
    <br>MIND BLOWING TRANSFORMATION!!!
    <br>My name is Anibal. I come from Paraguay.
    <br>I started to live that kind of life when I was 12 years old.
    <br>I wanted to be a woman
    <br>and I started fulfilling that desire by undergoing a breast implant surgery.
    <br>I had this surgery when I was 15 years old,
    <br>and after that I underwent many more surgeries on my breasts.
    <br>When I was 17 years old, I had to leave my country to go to Argentina.
    <br>I lived there like a woman with a male partner.
    <br>We lived together for 10 years.
    <br>I used to have long blonde hair.
    <br>This was what I looked like before.
    <br>I was never attracted to women, but rather to young men.
    <br>My neighbours and brothers from my church
    <br>told me about the Paraguay Crusade with Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>When they asked me if I was interested in going, I immediately said, "Yes"
    <br>because I really wanted to change from deep within me.
    <br>When Prophet TB Joshua touched me, I lost consciousness
    <br>and when I regained consciousness, I felt like another person - I felt like a man.
    <br>Many things changed in me spiritually and mentally.
    <br>There was a change that made me realise that what I wanted had happened - I am a man again.
    <br>Since the Paraguay Crusade, many changes started happening in my life.
    <br>I was no longer comfortable with my long hair
    <br>and I felt ridiculous seeing so many female clothes and shoes in my closet.
    <br>I don't want those things because I no longer need them.
    <br>I don't have affection for men anymore.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team took me to the hair salon to have a haircut
    <br>and change the colour of my hair.
    <br>I have it here.
    <br>This was my hair.
    <br>That was how I started my change, and the next step will be to have the breast implants removed.
    <br>I also need to change my wardrobe because I do not own a single piece of male clothing.
    <br>The doctors told me that the surgery is approximately 2,000 USD.
    <br>I am asking for financial assistance to undergo the surgery to remove the breast implants
    <br>because I do not have the money to pay for the surgery.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua, please assist me financially because I really need the surgery to change.
    <br>Anibal realised that the spiritual changes in his life after deliverance needed to manifest physically.
    <br>After requesting for help from Prophet TB Joshua,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV Team paid for Anibal to undergo surgery
    <br>to remove the implants in his breasts, costing over 2,000 USD.
    <br>First of all, I would like to thank Prophet TB Joshua for helping me to change
    <br>back to the original position in which God had created me.
    <br>Glory be to God.Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>It did not end there.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team took Anibal to a local mall to purchase male clothing - items here not worn for decades.
    <br>MIND BLOWING TRANSFORMATION!!!
    <br>What followed next was an emotional reconciliation with the members of his family and community,
    <br>all of whom were shocked at the dramatic turnaround in his life
    <br>after his encounter with Jesus Christ at the Paraguay Crusade with Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>MIND BLOWING TRANSFORMATION!!!
    <br>I want to thank Prophet TB Joshua for this miracle and change in my life
    <br>and for all the support that he has given me and is continuing to give me.
    <br>I believe that he will continue to support me.
    <br>MIND BLOWING TRANSFORMATION!!!
    <br>If we fail to realise there are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage,
    <br>we will continue to fight the wrong battle.
    <br>THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC CRUSADE WITH TB JOSHUA
    <br>And right now we are about to listen to the testimony of a young man whose life has completely transformed.
    <br>Hello everyone. My name is Anibal.
    <br>I came from Paraguay to share my testimony with you of what Jesus has done in my life.
    <br>Hello everyone. My name is Anibal. I am from Paraguay and I am here today to share my testimony with you
    <br>and to show the evidence of what Jesus Christ has done in my life.
    <br>I want to ask a question: Who believes in Jesus Christ?
    <br>I want to start sharing my story from when I was 12 years old until today.
    <br>When I was 12 years old, I felt like growing up as a girl and my family accepted it.
    <br>An evil spirit was residing in me.
    <br>At the age of 14 I had my first surgery and it was a gift from my family.
    <br>He said that he grew up thinking and believing that he was a girl
    <br>and even that was accepted in his family - for him to behave like a girl.
    <br>When he was 14 years old he did his first surgery.
    <br>After this first surgery, I felt more like a woman day by day.
    <br>I went into modelling. The way was open for me because I was smart.
    <br>I started taking female hormones when I was 19 years old.
    <br>This evil spirit made everything look easy.
    <br>He said that because of this evil spirit that was inside of him, he was behaving like a girl, like a female.
    <br>He was even taking female hormones to make his body like that of a woman's body.
    <br>He said that after doing the surgery at the age of 14, he felt much more like a woman physically
    <br>and he began behaving more and more like a woman each day.
    <br>When he was 19 years old he started taking female hormones.
    <br>I saw myself better than any other woman.
    <br>As you saw in the pictures, I was working in theatre;
    <br>I got more jobs in theatre than my female colleagues.
    <br>I never had affection for any female; I just treated them as friends.
    <br>He said that he never felt any affection for women; rather he only felt affection for men.
    <br>Even in his past life he was working as an artist in the theatre and was also into modelling.
    <br>Because he felt like a woman, he felt that he could do more than any of the women that he was working with.
    <br>And although he had friendships with women, he never felt any affection towards them.
    <br>He only felt affection towards men.
    <br>I made a lot of money and spent it all on myself - travelling, surgeries and the like.
    <br>Money that I could have used to help others, I spent it on myself and it was all in vain.
    <br>Today, everything that I invested in has come to nothing.
    <br>He said that he spent so much money trying to become a woman - even on his surgeries, on the clothes, everything.
    <br>And today he feels that money was totally wasted,
    <br>because that amount of money could have been used to help the needy or to do something else.
    <br>But he wasted all that money in trying to change to become a woman,
    <br>and it did not work out.
    <br>As a transgender, I got married.
    <br>I had everything I wanted with my partner - travelling, clothes - but I was not happy.
    <br>As a transgender, a person who got married,
    <br>and also he said that during that time he achieved everything he wanted humanly -
    <br>he had money, he had reputation, he had a job, he had everything -
    <br>yet he was not happy; he was not satisfied.
    <br>My neighbours came to comfort me, but I was not in the mood to listen to them.
    <br>They came back another day to invite me to a crusade
    <br>and I told them that I was okay with it.
    <br>Some neighbours came to try and advise him and counsel him and he did not want to listen to them,
    <br>until one day they came and told him that he should go to a crusade in Paraguay and he decided to go along with them.
    <br>Finally, I went to the crusade and from the first moment, I felt at home with everyone.
    <br>Although I had just lost my mother, I gained one big family in the love of Christ.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Now I have a Father who is Jesus Christ, and a second father who is TB Joshua.
    <br>He said he went to the crusade and from the moment he entered the crusade with Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>he felt as if he was within family.
    <br>He had lost his mother, he had lost his family, but God gave him a new family.
    <br>Now his Father is Jesus Christ, and he said that his second father is Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>When I arrived at the crusade, I did not want the prophet to touch me or come near me.
    <br>I changed my seat from the front to the back.
    <br>I was brought back to the front and the prophet touched me.
    <br>When I fell the first time, they picked me up and he touched me once again.
    <br>It was from that moment that my life changed forever.
    <br>At first he said that he did not want to be prayed for by Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>because of that spirit that was inside him - he kept resisting.
    <br>And then finally when Prophet TB Joshua prayed for him, he fell to the ground.
    <br>He said the second time that he received that touch,
    <br>when he stood up until this very moment, his life has changed 100%.
    <br>I went back home after the crusade and the next morning, while taking my usual shower,
    <br>I started to hate my appearance and my hair.
    <br>My hair was so long and I started to see it as a nuisance to dry and care for, so I just tied it up.
    <br>When I tied my hair, it became tangled and I saw it as a sign that I had to change.
    <br>After that, I went to my wardrobe and felt uncomfortable seeing all the clothes I had.
    <br>I went to jog and came back for my shower
    <br>and while in the shower, I realised that my breasts and hair suddenly looked strange to me.
    <br>After that I called Prophet TB Joshua's team to ask for help because I was broke.
    <br>He said that the first thing he noticed after the prayer of Prophet TB Joshua during the crusade
    <br>is that he went to his house, and as he showered like normal every night,
    <br>the first thing he noticed was that he felt so uncomfortable with his long hair.
    <br>He felt so strange and he did not like his hair anymore.
    <br>After that he began to look at his body that had the female breasts and he did not like that at all -
    <br>he felt so uncomfortable.
    <br>And from that moment he started looking at the female clothes.
    <br>He was not comfortable and happy with himself and he decided that he wanted to change,
    <br>but he realised that he did not have the financial means to do an operation to change physically
    <br>although that change had happened on the inside of him,
    <br>so he said that he asked for help from the team of Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>When I received a call that the prophet would pay for my surgery, I was very excited!
    <br>Within 24 hours all the tests for the surgery had been done.
    <br>The prophet made sure that the Emmanuel TV Team accompanied me throughout the process.
    <br>The prophet payed for my surgery and also replaced my entire wardrobe.
    <br>As you have seen, he spent over 3,000 USD on my transformation.
    <br>He said that when he received the call from the team of Prophet TB Joshua,
    <br>that Prophet TB Joshua himself was going to pay for the operation to remove the breast implants,
    <br>and also to buy a whole new wardrobe for him of male clothing, he was so happy.
    <br>He did not know what to do because this amounted to over 3,000 USD.
    <br>He said that not only that, but Prophet TB Joshua left one of his team in Paraguay to care for him.
    <br>Since then I can assure you that I have never felt any affection for or attraction to men.
    <br>My perspective on life has changed. At my age of 30 now, I would like to have a child.
    <br>Testimony From The Dominican Republic Crusade With TB Joshua - Day 1
    <br>He said that from that moment after the prayer with Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>that he does not feel any affection for men anymore; rather he feels attracted to women.
    <br>And he said that now, as he is 30 years old, he would like to have his own child one day.
    <br>I want to advise those who are in a similar situation to learn from me.
    <br>All the money in the world could not make me a woman.
    <br>Despite having so many surgeries, I am now back to the natural way God created me - as a man.
    <br>He said that he would like to advise everyone to learn from his own case.
    <br>That no matter the amount of money you spend on this earth - he said that he spent so much money -
    <br>that money could not make him a woman.
    <br>And today he wants to tell everyone that he is what God created him to be, which is a man.
    <br>My advice is: Don't waste time before you make a change in your life; look for help.
    <br>It was an evil spirit that entered me, but now I am free! It is never too late to change.
    <br>Look for your deliverance; go to a living church and watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Emmanuel TV is a big family open to everyone.
    <br>There is no limit to what Jesus can do through faith.
    <br>If you have faith and believe in God, nothing and nobody can be against you.
    <br>He said that his advice is: Don't wait before you come for your deliverance.
    <br>Although it is never too late to change, remember that only God can deliver you. This is a spiritual problem.
    <br>Watch Emmanuel TV. Get connected. Ask for help. Come to a living church
    <br>and believe that for faith there is no barrier; for faith there is no frontier, because all things are possible for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>So we thank God for your life
    <br>and pray God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance
    <br>by making the Word of God the standard for your life.
