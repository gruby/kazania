  <p>    
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Give thanks to Him for that.
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>Fine?
    <br>Really?
    <br>This means you have a testimony to give.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I thank God for this wonderful grace to be in the presence of the people of God
    <br>to share the message of the living God.
    <br>I want to thank God Almighty for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua, my mentor and my father.
    <br>If not him, where would I be today?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>The celebration continues because we are in His presence, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You heard what the man of God said about this year.
    <br>He said it is a fearful year.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let someone say, "God is alive."
    <br>Say, "I commit myself and all my ways to God."
    <br>I know when I secure myself by committing myself under the grace of God,
    <br>nothing out of God's control can happen to me.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Brethren, we are in perilous times.
    <br>Perilous times are difficult times - times of trials.
    <br>That's the reality.
    <br>Faith does not deny the existence of a problem
    <br>because we serve a God who never dodges crises.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That you are serving God in faith and in truth
    <br>does not mean you will not encounter challenges.
    <br>Being faithful to God Almighty does not eliminate adversities
    <br>but the Scripture says, all things are possible to him who believes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, all is possible to the one who believes."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, just believe."
    <br>Only believe - that is our refuge.
    <br>Say, "Only believe - that is my refuge."
    <br>Have faith in God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever this year brings, always remember that it honours God to believe Him
    <br>even while every sense contradicts Him.
    <br>He honours those who honour Him.
    <br>Of all graces, faith honours God the most and of all graces, God honours faith the most.
    <br>God is faithful to His faithful servants.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, fear not; cheer up!
    <br>Neighbour, the work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This brings us to our message this morning:
    <br>TRUST IN GOD'S AUTHORITY
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Trust in God's authority."
    <br>No matter what comes, no matter what happens, trust in God's authority.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Turn your Bibles to the Book of Matthew 28;
    <br>we start with verse 18:
    <br>"... Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, 'All authority has been given to Me
    <br>in heaven and on earth.
    <br>Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them
    <br>in the name of the Father and of  the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you;
    <br>and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age'."
    <br>Take note of that, He says, "I am with you to the end of the..."
    <br>Emmanuel! God is with us.
    <br>Say, "God is with me."
    <br>If God is with you, who can be against you?
    <br>If God is with a nation, who can be against her?
    <br>This is our assurance.
    <br>No man that influences the thinking of human beings has ever said these words.
    <br>No Old Testament prophet, not Abraham, not Isaac, not Jacob, not Moses
    <br>but Jesus did.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we put on Christ as our righteousness, we have access to the Father.
    <br>A sense of fatherhood will produce a natural basis for prayer
    <br>because we can contact the Father in the name of Jesus, the Son of God.
    <br>Jesus has brushed aside our unworthy past
    <br>and brought us to the presence of God without any sense of unworthiness.
    <br>This means a sense of righteousness brings an awareness of power and authority.
    <br>A sense of righteousness brings an awareness of self-knowing
    <br>and capacity to see the other side where the true light comes.
    <br>You can say I am a child of God, I'm a born-again, I'm no longer afraid.
    <br>I know who I am.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>all the power, authority and righteousness - God has given to our Lord Jesus Christ."
    <br>Jesus has bequeathed that to us today.
    <br>Jesus has given that to the Church today.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>the power and authority - you have it now."
    <br>With His righteousness, His strength is my strength.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>how can we exercise this power?"
    <br>The Bible says clearly:
    <br>Power and authority come when we are not standing in our own name,
    <br>when we are not preaching, talking in our own name.
    <br>This means that power and authority cannot be exercised at our own will
    <br>but under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>God is Spirit. Fear not; you are not alone."
    <br>If God is with you, what will follow?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "If God is with you, what will follow?"
    <br>You and God are the majority.
    <br>No matter the time, no matter the circumstances,
    <br>you and God are the majority.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever you may be facing, whatever you may face,
    <br>God will never allow the temptation to destroy you.
    <br>Whatever you may be facing in your private life, business or whatever,
    <br>God will never allow that to destroy you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "God is in control. God is in control of my life."
    <br>The Holy Spirit knows the tempter.
    <br>He knows the questions on the test and He will provide every accurate answer to the enemy.
    <br>The answers are always in the Word of God.
    <br>Show me your Bibles, let me see your Bibles.
    <br>The answer is in the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "My breakthrough, my healing, my deliverance is in the Word of God."
    <br>What I need to channel my course through this new year is the Word of God.
    <br>Therefore, allow God's Word to channel your way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our key responsibility is to trust the Holy Spirit -
    <br>to keep His Word in our mouth, in our heart and in every conversation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>our key responsibility is to trust the Holy Spirit."
    <br>Keep His Word in your mouth, heart and every conversation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>His Words are our weapons.
    <br>His Word in the midst of our heart gives us an authority in Heaven.
    <br>Jesus speaks to us through the Holy Word - reveals His view concerning a certain matter
    <br>and gives us a promise.
    <br>Faith comes from that promise.
    <br>What is His promise to you?
    <br>I will heal you.
    <br>I will deliver you.
    <br>I will bless you.
    <br>I will protect you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Christ's Word remains.
    <br>His Word will remain and be forceful.
    <br>His Word is there to see you through.
    <br>His Word remains and will be forceful, steadfast and sure.
    <br>God's Word is the final authority.
    <br>No matter what happens to you, trust the Word of God;
    <br>that Word is enough to see you through today.
    <br>When all around you people are scared, trust the Word of God to channel your way.
    <br>There is breakthrough and success in His Word and His Word can never fail.
    <br>Nothing is impossible to the Word of God.
    <br>Let someone say, "Nothing is impossible to the Word of God."
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says if you take God's Word to heart and truly make it part of you,
    <br>it will by its very nature change you
    <br>and when it does, you will find yourself called to act with God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Act with God."
    <br>The Word becomes a part of us by meditation.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the Word of God becomes a part of us by meditation."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, meditation is the key."
    <br>Whatever happens around you, sit back in silence and seek His face.
    <br>Brethren, the Scripture says:
    <br>The extent to which we think the thoughts of Christ,
    <br>to that same extent we have the power of God.
    <br>I repeat:
    <br>The extent to which we think the thoughts of Christ,
    <br>to that same extent we have the power of God.
    <br>This simply means when things happen, don't panic or be afraid; God is in control.
    <br>Faith is not a panic button to press in times of trouble.
    <br>When trials come, be still and don't submit to panic
    <br>because you cannot do the right thing in panic mode.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>when trials come, be still and don't submit to panic
    <br>because you cannot do the right thing in panic mode."
    <br>When you are still and do not submit to panic, then you can do the right thing
    <br>because you need a free heart to contact the Helper from above.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say to yourself and to your neighbour,
    <br>"In my daily challenges, I need to seek enough calm to think clearly and reflect diligently
    <br>because whatever my heart engages on influences my conduct and character."
    <br>If I think right, I will act right.
    <br>If I think negatively, I will act negatively.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>in this moment, in this perilous time, we should learn to sit back in silence
    <br>and listen to what God has to say."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>True believers must have the determination not to listen to the panic of the moment
    <br>but to seek the quiet voice of counsel and listen to what the Holy Spirit has to say in that matter.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>seek the quiet voice of counsel and listen to what the Holy Spirit has to say."
    <br>When you listen to His voice, He will rescue you from every pitfall of the enemy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, therefore, continue to pray in the Spirit continuously.
    <br>The man of God says, "What do I mean by praying in the Spirit?"
    <br>He says, "To pray in the Spirit is to pray in harmony with the Word of God."
    <br>To pray in harmony with the Word of God is to pray in harmony with the will of God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>learn to pray in harmony with the Word of God, with the will of God."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Glory be to God!"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, cheer up!
    <br>Neighbour, be determined!
    <br>Neighbour, you are not alone!"
    <br>Say, "I am not alone."
    <br>Let's look at what happened to Daniel.
    <br>In the Book of Daniel 6:10 - you all know the Scriptures.
    <br>The Bible says that the very moment the decree was signed, Daniel knew the danger of praying to God
    <br>yet he did not allow that to change his habit of praying many times to God every day.
    <br>He did not allow that to reduce His confidence and trust in God Almighty.
    <br>Instead, he prayed the more
    <br>because he had firm confidence in God's ability to deliver him from death.
    <br>When the decree was signed, he did not lament or cry out.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because he was still and did not submit to panic; he was able to do the right thing.
    <br>What is the right thing?
    <br>He ran to the presence of God, opened the windows and prayed the more,
    <br>glorified God and thanked God Almighty.
    <br>He left it all to God to glorify His holy name
    <br>and God gave him a mighty deliverance and put honour to His name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Daniel's right behaviour and good work that honoured his God
    <br>revealed that true faith was already lodged in his heart.
    <br>Daniel's right behaviour and good work that honoured his God
    <br>revealed that true faith was already lodged in his heart.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't lose heart; take care of your heart."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>His heroic example of faith is teaching you and me today, in this moment,
    <br>that God is not far from those who worship Him, who trust Him in spirit and in truth.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It teaches us that God's authority is incontestable,
    <br>that God's power and majesty are enough to support His authority,
    <br>that God still, today, is able to save, to secure His faithful servants.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I don't know what you are facing today but trust in God's authority not man's majority.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, trust in God's authority not in man's majority."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever you may be facing in your business in your life, in your career today,
    <br>there is a way out.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There is a way out."
    <br>The way out for me has come today; that's why I am here.
    <br>Thy way out for my business has come, for my career has come;
    <br>that's why I'm here, in the presence of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Finally brethren,
    <br>faith is a lifestyle of trusting in God.
    <br>Faith is a lifestyle of trusting in God Almighty -
    <br>not turning God around, not telling God what to do.
    <br>Let Him glorify His name in your circumstances.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>True believers, who learn to put their trust in God's authority not man's majority,
    <br>rise above every circumstance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you a true believer?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you a true believer?"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, look at me. I'm a true believer. That's why I'm here."
    <br>Say, "I am a true believer."
    <br>No mater what happens, no matter what comes,
    <br>I will say confidently, with boldness,
    <br>"Lord, Your Word is final authority in my life that settles all troubles and all questions."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Lord, I disagree with any thought, any situation, any circumstance contrary to Your Word.
    <br>Lord, my heart is fixed, grounded, established in the right foundation, on the solid foundation -
    <br>Your Living Word.
    <br>Lord, I stand on Your Word, in the assurance of Your mighty salvation."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Lord, here I am.
    <br>In this year 2019, putting your trust in God, in Christ Jesus
    <br>is the most important decision you make
    <br>because those who humble themselves under Jesus Christ
    <br>have found the right source to secure themselves."
    <br>May God bless His Word, in Jesus' name.
