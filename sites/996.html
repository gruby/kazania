  <p>    
    <br>Can I talk to you?
    <br>Who is this to you?
    <br>This is your wife.
    <br>You were with a woman in the past and she disappointed you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Before you had this woman.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What happened now; it has started now – it is an attack.
    <br>It’s true, sir.
    <br>When you married this lady, “My honey, my honey”.
    <br>Now the affection is not there any more.
    <br>It's true, sir.
    <br>When you people sit together, people will think you are husband and wife – no affection.
    <br>It's true, sir.
    <br>This woman doesn’t even want you to touch her.
    <br>It's true, sir.
    <br>When you sleep, in the night you will wake up and go sit on the chair.
    <br>It's true, sir.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>I want to see you.
    <br>Go and wait for me.
    <br>My name is Mr Chijioke Nwafor
    <br>The lady standing by me is my wife - Mrs Nwafor.
    <br>We came from Anambra State but we are based in Ekiti State, Nigeria.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God gave us prophecy.
    <br>He said it was God that saved me, that he saw me with a woman in the past who disappointed me.
    <br>He said what happened to me with that lady in the past is happening in my marriage now,
    <br>that there was no affection in my marriage which was an attack.
    <br>So, I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>She used to tell me that she wants to quit the marriage; we always fight and quarrel.
    <br>Because you don't want her to leave the marriage?
    <br>I don’t want her to leave the marriage.
    <br>Can you see now?
    <br>She wants to leave the marriage and the husband keeps portraying,
    <br>"What do you want me to do? You want me to cook for you today? I will cook for you.
    <br>You want me to wash your things? I'm ready to wash your clothes."
    <br>He has been washing, cooking, doing everything - yet, she still wanted to leave the marriage.
    <br>"What else do you want me to do? OK, I will carry you to America for holiday - New York.
    <br>After New York we go to London. After London we go to Africa..."
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>OK, now - I want to quit the marriage.
    <br>... because love is from the heart.
    <br>Listen to that: she says she wants to quit the marriage after everything he had done.
    <br>What is the solution?
    <br>Let's listen.
    <br>My name is Mrs Ebere Nwafor.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband.
    <br>We came from the Anambra State but we reside in the Ekiti State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am a 500 level student of Nnamdi Azikwe University in Akwa.
    <br>We have been married for the past one year.
    <br>Although I know my husband’s weakness, at a point, I had to call him and sit him down.
    <br>I told him the areas he was having weakness
    <br>and said we needed to build ourselves up together as one family.
    <br>The problem is all about his appearance; I want to start from there.
    <br>His appearance does not attract me, although I saw that before I married him.
    <br>What attracted me before I married him was his humility and simplicity.
    <br>I thought that if I entered the marriage, I would be able to mould him to my taste.
    <br>At a point, when we were together, I had to tell my husband that his appearance
    <br>was not as it supposed to be.
    <br>I told him he was only 35 years old but he dressed like someone who was 70.
    <br>I had to be sincere with him, told him to adjust and promised to help him.
    <br>No one is perfect.
    <br>I said I would mould him to my taste and he too would mould me to his own taste.
    <br>However, after we had planned everything, he would take a decision on his own.
    <br>At times, when he wanted to visit me in school, I would have to call him on the phone
    <br>and tell him what he had to wear because my friends were around.
    <br>I told him that he had to look good.
    <br>All these are the things which I experienced in marriage which I don’t like or want.
    <br>When you were about to get married, was he dressing like this?
    <br>He was not actually dressing like this but after the marriage, everything became worse.
    <br>His dressing does not attract me.
    <br>But before the marriage his look was very good?
    <br>He looked more attractive before I married him.
    <br>- OK.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Listen to that to learn a lesson.
    <br>Those who want to get married - you should dress well, rest...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After the marriage, no more gym.
    <br>The question now is...
    <br>Many of you are here today.
    <br>The posh car you were using when you wanted to get married - where is it after the marriage?
    <br>Does it mean you hired it?
    <br>This is what we are talking about.
    <br>Listen to her, she is making a point, as well as the gentleman.
    <br>We are here to learn.
    <br>Man of God, even in the aspect of his body, I have begged my husband to exercise himself.
    <br>You asked him to do exercise?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- OK.
    <br>I want him to...
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Chijioke Nwafor
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>It has really affected my affection for him because after everything, he would agree to do it
    <br>but at the end of the day, he wouldn’t do it.
    <br>Later on, he would come back to me and start begging me to forgive him but I wouldn’t be happy within me.
    <br>I want him to go and do what will bring peace in the house
    <br>because whenever I look at him, I am not proud of him.
    <br>I want my husband to look good; it is my job to treat him in the way I should but he is not responding.
    <br>That is my problem.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>But unless the prophecy had come at this time, you would have left the marriage.
    <br>Man of God, I must be sincere; I don’t want to leave the marriage.
    <br>OK, but you threatened that you wanted to leave?
    <br>Yes, but it’s not from my mind.
    <br>I don’t want to leave my marriage.
    <br>OK, thank you for all this.
    <br>I don't need to ask my brother, whatever...
    <br>Thank God you have mentioned his age.
    <br>The answer you gave me at first - we disagree with it - by saying that you just threatened your husband
    <br>about leaving the marriage.
    <br>We cannot live above our word.
    <br>That is - you cannot live above your word.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Satan uses our words to strike.
    <br>When you say, "I want to die...", you will soon die.
    <br>If I'm talking to you let me see your hand.
    <br>What you say out and is in compliance with satan to make it work, "I want to die..." - that is the word of satan -
    <br>satan will come and catch you.
    <br>"I want to leave my marriage..." - you will see people around and your husband saying it.
    <br>There will be people around to get you out of the marriage.
    <br>What we are saying now is: love is a thing of the heart.
    <br>We know that there is also a need to look good but the major love is a thing of what?
    <br>(Heart.)
    <br>... is a thing of heart.
    <br>Love is a thing of what?
    <br>(Heart.)
    <br>It is a thing of heart.
    <br>Even if your husband dresses now properly and put on the most expensive things -
    <br>that love, we are talking about, might not come back any more.
    <br>If I'm talking to you let me see your hand.
    <br>Even the man raises up his hand.
    <br>Clap for Jesus.
    <br>Let's assume, my friend - maybe his stomach is big.
    <br>It is one of the reasons even if she doesn't want to say that.
    <br>She wants him to have a flat one that will look good.
    <br>She wants him to wear most expensive clothes.
    <br>That love may not be there.
    <br>Those things cannot bring love.
    <br>Appearance cannot bring the love we are talking about.
    <br>Appearance cannot give birth to the love we call marriage.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "There are loves but the love we call marriage - appearance does not produce it".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There are so many loves but the love we call marriage - appearance does not give it".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If appearance gives marriage - that marriage cannot stand the test of time.
    <br>In a short time crisis or hardship will destroy the marriage.
    <br>By appearance...
    <br>The love we talk about is love of God.
    <br>If appearance is the basis of our marriage or relationship -
    <br>such relationship cannot stand the test of time.
    <br>Let us look at where the problem is coming from.
    <br>Does this marriage come from God?
    <br>What is the problem?
    <br>If I now say that my brother should go to gym, see doctor, go for a massage, reduce the stomach,
    <br>he is too short - he should be higher, and is too fat - he should be slimmer,
    <br>his head is too big - he should reduce it, there is too much fat in his hands - they should operate it -
    <br>that cannot give that love that will stand the test of time.
    <br>Let's look for love.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let's look for love somewhere".
    <br>Let's look for love somewhere.
    <br>Not appearance.
    <br>So, I think this is where we are going now.
    <br>Deliverance will solve the problem.
    <br>The problem we used to have is not the issue of my stature or whatever...
    <br>No no no, don't defend yourself.
    <br>I'm not defending you.
    <br>I am not trying to defend you.
    <br>Don't build on my defence.
    <br>You can have a separate defence.
    <br>Don't talk about the appearance.
    <br>I'm only telling you the Word of God.
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The original love, relationship comes from God.
    <br>If that relationship is the one that flows through your marriage, it has to do with things of the heart.
    <br>Things of the heart are quite different.
    <br>Listen, if you because of the things on the outside; appearance, money, position, being handsome,
    <br>get married with someone - bet with me; that marriage cannot stand the test of time.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What has happened to you is what has happened to the sister here.
    <br>I only mentioned your situation.
    <br>Yours is a disappointment.
    <br>The person she intended to marry before disappointed her.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Chijioke Nwafor
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Then she said, "Well, I just need to get married" - that is how she found you.
    <br>You have a problem and she has a problem - you need deliverance and she needs deliverance.
    <br>Let's assume you were able to find the person you are looking for to marry him from your heart -
    <br>this marriage would not exist today.
    <br>Let's assume she would be able to be with a person she gave her heart so much to
    <br>we would not talk of this marriage.
    <br>These two persons have similar problems.
    <br>Deliverance and deliverance.
    <br>50/50
    <br>I will see you people.
    <br>Thank you.
