  <p>    
    <br>Please, Man of God, help my son; he has a permanent erection since December 25th.
    <br>Man of God, help my son!
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me! I'm having a permanent erection.
    <br>It has been like this since last year. Man of God, help me!
    <br>Man of God, help me!
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>I slept with a prostitute, Man of God!
    <br>You went to a prostitute?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How much did you pay?
    <br>500 naira, Man of God.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>He's free; take him to the toilet.
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for him in the power of the Holy Ghost, he instructs him to go to the toilet
    <br>and urinate the poisonous substance that held his manhood.
    <br>Glory be to God! He's free in Jesus' name.
    <br>I told him to go and urinate. That is the poison that holds the penis.
    <br>Urinating Poisonous Substances
    <br>That is the poison.
    <br>There's no more pain. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! My son is healed! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>The pain there is gone - that is the poison that was stopped (from operating).
    <br>With that, he would not be able to urinate. Now that he has urinated, it's gone.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>A little while after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua, Mr Akinrinwa Sunday returned to The SCOAN
    <br>to testify of how Jesus Christ had completely healed him from the problem of a permanent erection.
    <br>The picture of tension and discomfort on the left side of the screen is an obvious difference
    <br>to the young man smiling on the right hand side.
    <br>It is clear to see that something has changed in his life after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The young man seen bent downward on the left,
    <br>poses to show the painful permanent erection visible even with his underwear on.
    <br>While on the right, the healed young man reveals his healthy body without any strain or discomfort.
    <br>Thanks to the miraculous healing he received in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The sickness and tension which had invaded his life has been replaced with good health and relaxation.
    <br>By the grace of God, Mr Sunday even taps his private part
    <br>to show that he feels no more pain or discomfort and that God has restored him completely
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>We can see the young man in our midst right now, full of joy. We want to listen to their testimony.
    <br>Brother, you're welcome. Please introduce yourself to us and the gentleman beside you.
    <br>My name is Akinrinwa Sunday and the person beside me is my father.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a permanent erection for five months.
    <br>What happened that day was that my friends and I went out and I met with a prostitute.
    <br>After meeting with the prostitute, I went back home and entered the kitchen to eat.
    <br>After eating, I went upstairs to the toilet.
    <br>On coming out of the toilet, a strong breeze blew on me and I collapsed immediately.
    <br>Unfortunately, I found myself the next day in a hospital.
    <br>When I woke up, I had pain all over my body and I had a permanent erection.
    <br>When this problem started, I had severe pain to such an extent that I couldn't get out of bed.
    <br>They gave me different medications, injections, but the erection still persisted.
    <br>The doctors in the hospital said I had to undergo an operation which my father rejected.
    <br>After my father had rejected the operation, they had to discharge me.
    <br>After being discharged, I was taken to different churches for prayers which still brought no change.
    <br>My father said that he watches Emmanuel TV all the time and this kind of problem
    <br>occurred before and the man of God solved it.
    <br>Hence, he said we should come down to The SCOAN.
    <br>Okay, brother, just before you describe what happened when you came here,
    <br>could you just tell us - for those five months that you're having this permanent erection,
    <br>just give an idea of the kind of pain you were having at that period.
    <br>The pain was so terrible! When I woke up, I couldn't get off the bed.
    <br>To sit down or lay down was a problem; I had pain all over my body.
    <br>I couldn't withstand the pain; I couldn't go out nor put on anything.
    <br>So, for those five months, you were basically in your house unable to move about or do anything
    <br>because of the severity of those pains.
    <br>I couldn't go out or do anything at all; I was just laying on the bed for five months.
    <br>When I was brought to The SCOAN, the man of God immediately stretched forth his hand towards me,
    <br>my manhood began to shake and I felt a cool breeze on me.
    <br>The pain left my body immediately and the man of God told me to go and urinate.
    <br>He said the poison will be removed through urination.
    <br>Immediately, the pain left after I urinated!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We want you to explain again, brother. You mean as the the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>began to pray for you, physically, your private part began to vibrate as the spirit of God started touching you?
    <br>Yes, my manhood began to vibrate and shake as if there were some objects inside it.
    <br>I just give glory to God!
    <br>Then afterwards, we saw that you urinated out this poisonous substance.
    <br>Tell us, ever since that encounter two weeks ago here in The SCOAN, what has happened?
    <br>After urinating, immediately the pain left me; I don't feel it anymore.
    <br>The permanent erection went down and my manhood is normal now.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We listened to our brother. He said that after he urinated out that poisonous substance, the pain left
    <br>and slowly but surely that permanent erection began to reduce, until the point where it was no longer a problem to him.
    <br>It was normal. Since then his erection has come down and he's now living a normal life.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Brother, you mean to say that the pain has gone? You've been walking, moving around,
    <br>eating freely, sleeping well since that deliverance?
    <br>After I received a touch from the man of God that day, I slept like a baby!
    <br>I can walk around, jump and do all sorts of things I couldn't do before.
    <br>I give glory to God.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Just to the glory of God: Can you just show us the things you can now do that you couldn't do before
    <br>and just quickly move in our midst to show us?
    <br>Before I couldn't walk but now I'm walking freely; I couldn't jump but now I can jump!
    <br>I can exercise now; I am free and I give glory to God.
    <br>Before I couldn't even touch it but now I can touch it and this is it.
    <br>Mr Akinrinwa Sunday & Father
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Hallelujah! Glory be to God! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We can see something that we'd understand, especially the men in our midst would understand.
    <br>It would be impossible for our brother to have touched the area in that manner with the permanent erection
    <br>but we can see him tapping the area without any pain.
    <br>Walking freely, even jumping in the midst of the people of God to testify that indeed, he is completely healed.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, right now we want to hear a quick word from your dad.
    <br>What he has to say concerning the wonderful deliverance in the life of his son.
    <br>Sir, you're welcome. Please introduce yourself to us.Tell us what you're doing for a living
    <br>and tell us more about the wonderful testimony we've heard from your son.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Akinrinwa Oriola. I come from Ondo state, Nigeria.
    <br>I am into medicine. I am the Deputy State President of Ondo state.
    <br>The boy standing beside me is my son.
    <br>What actually happened was that on the 25th of December 2016,
    <br>when we came back from church, this boy went out.
    <br>That evening, his mother was constantly calling me.
    <br>I answered, "What's the problem? You have two matured sons at home.
    <br>If it is about the generator or fuel, they should go and get it for you".
    <br>But she kept on calling me and when I picked it up this time, I heard people shouting,
    <br>"In Jesus' name", so I took a vehicle and went back home.
    <br>On reaching home, I met my young boy that is in UniBen struggling; I got so confused!
    <br>We decided to take him to a specialist hospital where doctors battled with his problem.
    <br>We didn't know then what was actually happening.
    <br>On the second day we discovered that the boy had a permanent erection.
    <br>After a lot of medications from here and there, we sat down with some of my close friends;
    <br>discussing his case and they suggested that it's better for the boy to undergo surgery.
    <br>I said to myself that this was over 48 hours, and anything done after such a time would be 50/50.
    <br>I have been watching Emmanuel TV and last year a man with a similar problem was delivered.
    <br>I said to myself that my son's problem is not exceptional; we have to be there.
    <br>I believed that this will be my last bus stop.
    <br>Two weeks ago, I brought the boy down to The SCOAN and the man of God prayed for him,
    <br>today, it's a thing of the past!
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Tell us, since those two weeks that your son received his healing here, what are the changes you've seen
    <br>and what can you testify about him as a father?
    <br>There were a lot of changes for him; I had to divide the semester for him.
    <br>He is a university student of science and technology but due to that problem,
    <br>we had to postpone the semester whereby it's still pending; it's about his education.
    <br>About other activities, he was more or less an incomplete human being because
    <br>the ability to move and do something was zero, due to the severe pains he was experiencing.
    <br>The more the problem persisted, the more he deteriorated day by day.
    <br>He would wrestle with the problem until he slumbered and we would rush him to the hospital.
    <br>Today, it's a new dawn for him.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen! Glory be to God Almighty. What is your word of advice to our viewers
    <br>especially as you introduced yourself as someone in the medical field?
    <br>We know you tried your best medically to treat such a case, even to the extent of preparing for an operation.
    <br>But to the glory of God you came here and Jesus Christ intervened.
    <br>So what is your word of advice to viewers all over the world?
    <br>Thank you, sir. This is a big lesson for the young ones.
    <br>When your parents take you to school, you should focus and concentrate.
    <br>Work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything depends on God. Thank you.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let's just hear a final word from our brother. What is your own word of advice?
    <br>You have heard it from your father - just earlier, a word of warning for young ones out there.
    <br>As someone that has passed through this amount of pain for five months after meeting a prostitute,
    <br>what is your own word of advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>My word of advice to the youths out there is that they should stay away from fornication and adultery,
    <br>they should move closer to God in any situation they find themselves in,
    <br>and not further away from Him.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
