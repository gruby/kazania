  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is led by the Holy Ghost to pray for visitors to The SCOAN from all over the globe in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Whatever barrier, affliction or challenge they were facing melted like wax before the Lord of hosts
    <br>at the mention of the name Jesus Christ in prayer.
    <br>As the ministration continued, surprisingly, this woman sprang from her seat,
    <br>moments before the man of God got to her, and started running away across the auditorium.
    <br>Let's find out why.
    <br>We'll kill everyone here.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Ancestors.
    <br>What have you done to her ?
    <br>Ancestors.
    <br>I will kill that husband; I will kill her husband.
    <br>What have you done to her marriage?
    <br>Which marriage? There is no marriage.
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>Which career?
    <br>I have destroyed this lady; I have destroyed her.
    <br>She will kill you. This lady - she will kill you. Just leave here; leave here right now.
    <br>Breaking whatever chain the devil had used to bind this woman to himself,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua set her free by the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>As she was declared free, she was helped to her feet
    <br>and began to rejoice in the freedom that comes from deliverance.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you. My name is Yvonne Rapati from Johannesburg, South Africa.
    <br>The man standing next to me is my lovely husband, Gideon Rapati.
    <br>He is also from South Africa. Thank you.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was setback and the need for financial breakthrough.
    <br>I didn't know that I had spirits in me.
    <br>But then I was born into a family that worships idols.
    <br>From both families - from my father's side and from my mother's side.
    <br>So, last week I was delivered from all those spirits.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying for the people in the church,
    <br>he came to the altar and prayed for me.
    <br>Oh my God. I didn't know that one day, I would be the one manifesting.
    <br>I used to tell my husband, "When I go to The SCOAN, I will never do such things".
    <br>I was surprised when I was seeing myself manifesting, fighting.
    <br>I thank God that the man of God delivered me from all the spirits.
    <br>The spirit of anger cost me a lot because every time my husband was trying to talk to me,
    <br>was trying to have a conversation with me, I was ready to fight all the time.
    <br>I was ready to defend all the time.
    <br>And I didn't know what I was defending myself for.
    <br>I remember one day, when I went to the hairdresser, my husband came late to fetch me.
    <br>Some other ladies were there.
    <br>They were telling me some issues about my husband, what he was doing there.
    <br>They said that my husband was dating someone in the saloon.
    <br>I just kept quiet.
    <br>When he came to fetch me, we went back to the house.
    <br>When we were driving home, I asked him about this issue. He refused to answer me.
    <br>My God, that spirit of anger came whilst he was driving.
    <br>I don't know what happened, but I jumped.
    <br>I grabbed the steering wheel, I turned the steering wheel while the car was moving.
    <br>He was driving 120 mph, and the car over turned.
    <br>Then, I went for the gun because my husband is a policeman in South Africa.
    <br>What I was trying to reach was a gun.
    <br>The spirit in me wanted me to kill him.
    <br>So I went for the gun.
    <br>When I tried to grab the gun, the gun fell down. So I opened the door.
    <br>My husband just opened the door and ran.
    <br>I grabbed that gun. I left the car there while the ignition was still on.
    <br>So, I just left the car there, in the middle of the road. I went back home
    <br>I was just trekking. I was walking.
    <br>My husband went straight to the police station.
    <br>He went there to report me that I wanted to shoot him.
    <br>Then, the policemen came - there were 4 of them.
    <br>By then I was in the house.
    <br>When they came, I quickly grabbed the gun and pointed the gun at them.
    <br>I said, "If any one of you comes near me, I will show you today. I will shoot you to death".
    <br>So three of them ran; they ran back.
    <br>My husband also ran back.
    <br>One of the policeman came to me. He said, "You know what, sister, please calm down!
    <br>I just want to speak to you. Calm down!"
    <br>So I managed, I don't know how I managed to calm down.
    <br>Then he said to me, "Give me the gun".
    <br>I said, "You know what? Talk whatever you want to talk, I'm not giving you this gun.
    <br>I want to shoot that husband of mine today. I want to kill him today".
    <br>The policeman said to me, "Please put the gun down. Let us speak.
    <br>We are here to speak to you, we are not here to arrest you".
    <br>I managed to give the policeman that gun.
    <br>Then my husband came in.
    <br>Then my husband said to them, "I don't want to talk to her nor to anyone.
    <br>What I'm here for is to take my clothes. I'm moving out of this house".
    <br>I was happy to hear that.
    <br>Then my husband went straight to the bedroom.
    <br>He took all his clothes. Then all of them went away.
    <br>I was just happy to own the house because I was the man of that house.
    <br>I was the one who gave instructions all the time. I was always screaming and fighting.
    <br>I never showed my husband and my children love.
    <br>Especially my ten-year-old daughter. She said that I was always beating her without skipping a day.
    <br>I've got three children.
    <br>The first one is the mother of the other two
    <br>because all the time, when they wanted something, they wouldn't come to me.
    <br>They would go straight to their father, "Father, please give us food. Give us this".
    <br>When they came to me, I would beat them - all of them.
    <br>I was always fighting in the house. I was always causing problems.
    <br>I was looking for problems all the time. I never had peace.
    <br>I never knew that this day, today, would come.
    <br>I never knew that one day I would sit with my husband and we would have a conversation.
    <br>Or sit with my husband and smile at him or talk to him.
    <br>I thank the prophet, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for this day.
    <br>Madam, you said that this spirit made you the man of the house.
    <br>Can you describe the things that you were instructing your husband to do,
    <br>that ordinarily a wife was supposed to do.
    <br>What were some of those things you were pushing him to do?
    <br>As husband and wife...
    <br>When you are staying together, you have to meet as husband and wife.
    <br>But in my house, there were instructions. I would only meet with him when I wanted.
    <br>At my workplace, I work 7 days in, 7 days out.
    <br>When I was working that week, the full seven days he was not allowed to touch me.
    <br>He was not allowed to come near me.
    <br>Every time he would be begging me, "Please come to sleep".
    <br>I would just say, "Okay. Go to sleep. I'm coming right now".
    <br>I would just leave my husband to go to sleep,
    <br>and then around 2:00 am, I would go to bed slowly so that he wouldn't touch me.
    <br>The minute he would wake up and say, "Why are you doing this?", fighting again. I was ready to attack.
    <br>I was always fighting him.
    <br>This spirit has affected my life a lot.
    <br>I didn't even cook in the house. He was the one who was doing the house chores.
    <br>He was the one who was cooking. He was the one who was bathing the children.
    <br>He was the one who was doing everything. I was always tired.
    <br>When he had cooked and I came home from work,
    <br>he would say, "I've already cooked. Just dish up".
    <br>I would say, "Okay. I'm coming right now". I would go straight to the bathroom, take my shower.
    <br>After that - gone!
    <br>I didn't dish up for him. I didn't dish up for my kids.
    <br>So these spirits have affected my life a lot.
    <br>Sister, can you tell us, last week as Prophet T.B. Joshua was moving around...
    <br>You had told your husband that when you come to The SCOAN, you are not going to manifest. Nothing would happen.
    <br>Describe to us what happened last week, as the prophet began to move around and pray for people.
    <br>Okay. When the prophet was touching everyone, I was just look around,
    <br>saying to myself, "These people, I wonder what they are doing - manifesting and doing all that".
    <br>I was just wondering, "What's going on?"
    <br>The minute the prophet came to the altar - I was sitting there at the back of the altar -
    <br>when he came near me, he never even touched me.
    <br>When he came closer, something just came into me, "Run away!". I was just shaking.
    <br>I ran away. I was surprised at seeing everybody around me.
    <br>Everybody was surrounding me. I was just surprised, "What's going on?"
    <br>That was how the evil spirit within our sister was exposed.
    <br>It tried to cause her to run away but the power of God took control as we can see.
    <br>That's how that spirit was confessing what it had caused in her life.
    <br>Tell us, sister, to the glory of God, ever since that touch, what are the changes that you've seen in your life?
    <br>Before that, when Prophet T.B. Joshua was touching everyone,
    <br>when he lifted up his hand - wham!
    <br>I saw something. The hand was very huge!
    <br>When he did 'wham', I said to myself, "I'm not here for this, I'm running away for my life.
    <br>He's going to kill me". That hand was very huge.
    <br>When I looked at him in his eyes, I saw flames. I saw fire in his eyes, so that's why I ran away.
    <br>Ever since that touch...
    <br>I never knew that one day, I would smile at my husband.
    <br>He had never in his life saw me smiling, talking to him nicely.
    <br>It wasn't easy for me to say 'sorry', but since we came to the SCOAN,
    <br>everything he says or every time I've wronged him, I would say, "I'm sorry".
    <br>I thank God for my life. I thank God for this.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is the confirmation of our sister's deliverance and we all heard what she said earlier.
    <br>She said that even before coming to The SCOAN, she told her husband that if we get there, nothing will happen to me.
    <br>I'm not going to manifest like others. Even as Prophet T.B. Joshua was moving around, she was just observing,
    <br>thinking to herself that nothing would happen, she would never fall.
    <br>But we saw at that touch, everything changed, and that evil spirit was exposed and deliverance came.
    <br>So at this point, we want to listen to your husband - a few words.
    <br>We believe he's in a position to shed more light on the experiences in the past.
    <br>Sir, you're welcome. Please introduce yourself to us.
    <br>Children of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Indeed, God is with us.
    <br>My name is Mr Gideon Rapati.
    <br>And the beauty standing beside me is my lovely wife, Mrs Yvonne Rapati.
    <br>I am a police officer in South Africa, in my country
    <br>and also a subject matter expert on issues of domestic violence.
    <br>Mr Gideon Rapati
    <br>Police Officer, South Africa
    <br>I have been taken away from doing operational duties at the police station in our state,
    <br>and I was taken straight to the training division of the South African police.
    <br>I facilitate exactly this type of intervention - domestic violence learning program -
    <br>to both my colleagues and all the people within my jurisdiction,
    <br>within the cluster that we are serving.
    <br>So, my life feels like a very long life.
    <br>The 12 years that I have spent with my wife feel like 50 years of my life.
    <br>But with the grace of God I endured.
    <br>Mr Gideon Rapati & Wife
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Children of God, I have experienced the life of long-suffering.
    <br>My wife has already said most of the things that I'm going to say.
    <br>When I met my wife, she was very down-to-earth.
    <br>You can see how beautiful she is; any man would want to settle with her.
    <br>We met and within a week's time of knowing each other...
    <br>I was staying in police barracks at a male dormitory,
    <br>where I was not even allowed to bring a woman in.
    <br>But I started sneaking her in.
    <br>Within a month, my wife had already moved in with me in that barracks.
    <br>I had to totally disregard all the visits from the officials
    <br>who frequently came to see if there was anything that we were doing that we were not supposed to do.
    <br>I fell in love with my wife, who was a very good woman then.
    <br>But from there, we started having a little argument there, and fights there.
    <br>We had already moved in together by then, when she said to me,
    <br>"Mr Rapati, I can't stay with you. Where I come from, they would never allow this.
    <br>You must go and introduce yourself. You must go and pay the bride price".
    <br>So everything between my wife and I happened quickly.
    <br>I'm saying the events were happening in a quick succession.
    <br>Personally, I have never really got to know her and her purpose in my life.
    <br>What happened between me and my wife...
    <br>We had our first child; our daughter is now 11 years old.
    <br>Immediately after we had a child together, my wife started calling all the shots.
    <br>I became a puppet. My wife became my puppet master.
    <br>So, she took over. To an extent that I sometimes saw myself as a prisoner but I endured!
    <br>I saw myself like I had self-imprisoned myself
    <br>because something would tell me, "Go! This woman is not the right woman for you".
    <br>Okay, my daughter was still very young then.
    <br>My wife had to go home, from where I was born, a place called Tahu, Northwest.
    <br>She had to go and wean the child there until the child was old enough.
    <br>While she was in town, she befriended with some forces that were against me.
    <br>She even got close to my biological mother.
    <br>Every nonsense that she was told about me precipitated the anger and hatred against me.
    <br>When she came back from home, she never told me the journey from my own hometown.
    <br>She never told me anything.
    <br>But she was living life, suggesting that something bad must have been told to her.
    <br>Like my wife said,
    <br>I would be driving a motor vehicle on a public road,
    <br>my wife would start an argument, a small thing,
    <br>a little thing to her was to become a worst case scenario.
    <br>It would be blown out of proportion, a little thing; even if I tried to calm her down.
    <br>Now, she would be using her physicality.
    <br>I would be driving a car. She would be fighting for the steering wheel while the car was moving.
    <br>She would be struggling to disarm me, to take the firearm from my harness. This is the service pistol!
    <br>I have two firearms. I have a service pistol. I have a private firearm.
    <br>So, I'm always scared - whether I'm at work or not around at home.
    <br>She would be struggling to get possession of my firearm.
    <br>She would say, "Today, I'm going to kill you, you are dead.
    <br>After killing you, I'm going to kill myself".
    <br>She would be opening the car door while the car was in motion,
    <br>trying to jump out of the moving vehicle to commit suicide.
    <br>I said, "Oh my God, now if she jumps out of the moving vehicle,
    <br>it means the family, my in-laws will be pinning her death on me.
    <br>They won't see it as a suicide".
    <br>But I thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua because I prayed when I left my country.
    <br>I said, "God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, I know you will vindicate me in all this".
    <br>Mr Gideon Rapati & Wife
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Indeed, children of God, as I'm standing here right now,
    <br>I feel I have got my freedom. I'm a free man now.
    <br>But my wife, who was manifesting - I know that demons were the ones who put me through long suffering.
    <br>The beauty standing here was not responsible; it was a demon.
    <br>Because this coward called demon, he does not come in one form.
    <br>He has so many forms; because he's a coward, he can't show himself.
    <br>He can use any form to come and mesmerize somebody's life.
    <br>It is true. My wife was always in a mood of fighting.
    <br>Five minutes!
    <br>I could never sit down with my wife, discuss anything pertaining to the household or the children.
    <br>Five minutes was enough, then she would just snap out of the blue.
    <br>She would be pointing fingers. She would become aggressive.
    <br>Even if I was trying to reason with her, my wife would be telling me,
    <br>"I'm not going to sit down and listen to this shit".
    <br>Telling me this straight to my face.
    <br>Remember this was the woman who would even want to pull my manhood.
    <br>I would be driving the car. She would then grab me in the front.
    <br>She would be beating me, using the palm of the hand, hit me hard try to take the firearm.
    <br>I would try to tend to the vehicle so that the vehicle wouldn't just go awry, with no control.
    <br>This was a woman who always accused me of cheating on her.
    <br>It is very painful when somebody accuses you of cheating, and yet, you know you're not cheating.
    <br>My wife would tell me straight, "You can pack your bags and go back to your ex", calling her by name.
    <br>She would even go to the extent of describing my ex.
    <br>Even before she met her, she would be describing how nice and caring she is.
    <br>There is no word my wife hasn't said to me.
    <br>Ugly words that will never go back.
    <br>You know, it is good now. I'm in the arena of liberty!
    <br>During my stay here, I have learned a lot about the art of forgiving.
    <br>To speak forgiveness, you are doing it for God, all glory goes to God.
    <br>Now, there is a confession that I want to make in this church.
    <br>The confession will shock my sisters and my brother at home in South Africa.
    <br>I didn't grow up with them. My mother gave me away when I was three months old.
    <br>She gave me to my aunt to raise me, so I grew up knowing my aunt as my mother.
    <br>I was perplexed when I turned 16 or 17 and people told me, "No, your mother is actually that one".
    <br>My mother did not give me away for any other reason than that she was struggling in life.
    <br>It was not deliberate.
    <br>So, when I came back home to join my real family,
    <br>some of my relatives just wanted to make me feel unwelcomed.
    <br>My heart was where I grew up.
    <br>So, when my wife was weaning the child at home,
    <br>I didn't know if my mom wanted to become frank or friendly to my wife (or not).
    <br>My mom told my wife that I had a sexually transmitted disease.
    <br>They call it 'drop' at home.
    <br>My wife never told me anything (about that conversation).
    <br>But whenever we finished having bedroom fun, she would jump up and go to clean herself.
    <br>I didn't know why. She would lie and say it's her culture. It's a culture thing from where she comes from.
    <br>Not knowing that she was cleaning herself up, so I couldn't infect her.
    <br>I met her six years later.
    <br>South Africa has the best hospitals.
    <br>I was cured of everything; I was clean.
    <br>One day, she told me it's my mom and my other relatives, that I am not going to mention, who told her.
    <br>I went to the hardware store and bought an axe!
    <br>I took it to those who do welding works to sharpen it. It was sharpened.
    <br>What I intended to do with the axe was to go home to attack my mother,
    <br>take a rope and hang myself, and my life would be finished.
    <br>Because I couldn't keep any women because of their interference.
    <br>But I have since forgiven my mother. After this I said, "I cannot do this to my mother because of a woman.
    <br>I cannot go to the extreme of doing that to my own mother. I have to forgive my mother.
    <br>I have to be friends with my mother".
    <br>I started experiencing a lot of love from my own mother. That was what unsettled my wife.
    <br>That was what made my wife accusing me of one thing or another.
    <br>Those things that I was not doing.
    <br>I found myself in an environment where I was reduced to a mere wife at home.
    <br>My wife works a twelve hour shift. I work only an eight hour shift.
    <br>So I'm the one who gets home early. I would be the one doing all the chores.
    <br>I would bathe the younger one, and I would help the other two to take their own baths.
    <br>I played the part of a mom, to an extent that my children saw me as a mother.
    <br>When I went to fetch my wife from work, my children would pass my wife, even if she was right in front of me.
    <br>My children would pass her and come to embrace me.
    <br>My children have the culture of hugging me.
    <br>All three of them would advance to me, pass their mother and come to embrace me.
    <br>Their mother would be saying, "Ah, they love you more than me". It's like there is no issue then.
    <br>Since I met my wife, one thing needs to be mentioned,
    <br>I experienced a lot of motor vehicle accidents.
    <br>Two with her. We cheated death.
    <br>Hitting a cattle - the two of us seated in the front - but the cattle flew over and I thank God for that.
    <br>I told myself that selling my car to pay for the trip to come to The SCOAN is worth while.
    <br>I told myself that the day I go, my problems will be things of the past.
    <br>A week prior to our trip to The SCOAN.
    <br>I never slept in the same room with my wife.
    <br>She was sleeping in the main bedroom. I was sleeping in my son's bedroom.
    <br>Before we came, on the same day that we had to depart from South Africa, my wife packed her bags.
    <br>There was no big argument.
    <br>She said she's leaving to go and cool herself off at her sister's place in another province.
    <br>Now, what I'm saying to the people of God, in general,
    <br>if a demon is involved, you won't see it, it does not come face to face with you.
    <br>My life experienced a downslope.
    <br>Financially, before I met her, I was able to pay my accounts. I was able to run my life.
    <br>When she came into my life, everything went down slope.
    <br>I am now in the deepest financial quagmire with a lot of financial institutions in South Africa.
    <br>And she also.
    <br>Because we live our lives on borrowed money. We live on credit.
    <br>So, brother, we want to find out from you now about
    <br>when you came and the man of God prayed for your wife.
    <br>Just tell us, when he prayed for your wife, what happened?
    <br>And ever since that day, what are the changes that you've seen in her and your life?
    <br>When the man of God prayed for my wife - in me, there was a mixed reaction of feelings.
    <br>I was overwhelmed. Something said to me, I must advance to the altar and claim that she's my wife.
    <br>But because of the order and organization in this place, I had to stay on my seat.
    <br>I was very happy because the fullness of light was now approaching the darkness,
    <br>that is why you saw my wife running away, because of her darkness.
    <br>Ever since then, you have been together for one week now.
    <br>What are the changes that you've seen in your life and marriage?
    <br>I have seen this beauty next to me falling in love with me all over again.
    <br>Mr Gideon Rapati & Wife
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Now since my wife's deliverance, she's smiling back at me.
    <br>We are having civil, decent conversations.
    <br>We are even planning the life in Christ together.
    <br>That when we leave here, when we go back to our country, we are going to reflect Jesus Christ in us.
    <br>Mr Gideon Rapati & Wife

    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ for this reconciliation!
    <br>You mean to say that now the affection is restored, you're now able to love your wife
    <br>and she's able to love you, something that has been missing from this marriage for 12 years?
    <br>All those things have come to bow down to the name Jesus.
    <br>Let me tell you something, children of God
    <br>This is my experience.
    <br>I would be enduring that long-suffering, not knowing that I only had to run to one man called Jesus Christ.
    <br>At work, my colleagues and my friends, I didn't know that when I approached them to seek advice,
    <br>immediately after I had left, they would make a meal out of it.
    <br>I would become breakfast, lunch and supper for them.
    <br>I would become a laughingstock, a joke and everything you can think of.
    <br>I didn't know that all my problems, all I had to do was to take them to Jesus Christ
    <br>because He said, all your burdens are My burdens.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give glory to God once again,
    <br>and finally, sir, what is your advice to our viewers around the world?
    <br>Alright.
    <br>Viewers, I stand in front of you to declare and to decree to you that
    <br>there is only one Man who can bring solutions to your life.
    <br>Like I have said, don't seek advice. Don't even narrate your own life to anybody.
    <br>Everything! Hardships, setbacks and everything!
    <br>Whether you are fighting with your wife. Whether your marital life is not a bed full of roses.
    <br>Run to God because God will never laugh at your problem.
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Just finally from our sister, your final word of advice to our viewers around the world.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The advice for people all over the world is that
    <br>when you are facing some challenges with your husband,
    <br>don't go to traditional healers, they don't have a solution.
    <br>I know it from my own experience
    <br>because I was going from one traditional healer to another.
    <br>You would pay. I didn't mind to pay 3000 or 5000.
    <br>What they would do to your body - hey!
    <br>They would cut your body all over; you would think that cutting your body was the solution.
    <br>I didn't know that they were putting a lot of spirits in my body to see myself as a man.
    <br>So what I am saying now is that
    <br>you know when you go from one traditional healer to another,
    <br>I was experiencing a lot of things, I was seeing things
    <br>without my husband telling me or anyone telling me.
    <br>I would tell him, "You are doing this, you are doing that".
    <br>I would find out that those things were true. And no one had to tell me about those things.
    <br>I was just dreaming it. It's because of devil, it's because of satan.
    <br>Satan was giving me all those dreams. So that I had to keep on fighting, keep on fighting.
    <br>Men all over the world, be supportive to your wife. Thank you!
