    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>This is just a word of exhortation.
    <br>So let's take our Bible to the Book of Psalm.
    <br>The Book of Psalm 66:18.
    <br>"If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened."
    <br>Let's take our Bible also to the Book of Matthew 5.
    <br>It's related to that Book of Psalm 66:18.
    <br>Let's read verse 8.
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see Jesus."
    <br>It's all about heart.
    <br>Psalm 66:18 says: "If I cherish iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me."
    <br>In this Matthew 5:8 it says:
    <br>"Blessed are the pure in heart..."
    <br>Take note: If I cherish iniquity in my heart,
    <br>the Lord will not hear me.
    <br>Heart, heart, heart...
    <br>What does this mean to us?
    <br>It means the greatest thing the Lord looks into is our heart.
    <br>The greatest thing, the most cherished thing the Lord looks into is our heart.
    <br>We are made in our hearts to be like Jesus.
    <br>Whatever colour, race, appearance - it does not matter.
    <br>Whether you are black, yellow, red - whatever colour - the judgment will be based on our heart,
    <br>that is the content of our character.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We are made in our hearts to be like Him.
    <br>If you cherish iniquity in your heart, the Lord will not hear you.
    <br>This is why only faith pleases God and the faith is of man's heart.
    <br>When we say 'heart', we mean 'the spirit of man' - biblically.
    <br>Heart.
    <br>Whatever appearance, colour, race - it does not matter.
    <br>Heart.
    <br>With a pure heart, a man knows that Jesus is Lord.
    <br>With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus is righteousness.
    <br>With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves.
    <br>With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus heals.
    <br>If you cherish iniquity, that is sin, if your honour iniquity in your heart,
    <br>the Lord will not listen to you.
    <br>God listens, Jesus listens as you pray and He replies in relation to the state of your heart.
    <br>You say: "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!.."
    <br>He listens, replies in relation to the state of your heart.
    <br>If you hold grudges in your heart and you are saying "Jesus", you are wasting your time.
    <br>If you hold offence and you are saying "Jesus", you are wasting your time.
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>If you hold offence in your heart, don't be surprised if the Bible will make no meaning to you.
    <br>If you hold offence such as bitterness, grudges, anger, hatred and so forth and you open the Bible
    <br>and you hold offence against someone, against anyone and you are reading Bible, you are wasting your time.
    <br>You are reading literature.
    <br>This is The Book of books.
    <br>When you are reading it, you are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Heart.
    <br>If we know we are made in our heart to be like Jesus, why are we fighting over colour?
    <br>Why short, why high? Why big stomach, why small stomach?
    <br>I want to be like Jesus in my heart.
    <br>If you hold offence in your heart, don't be surprised that your prayer will not be accepted.
    <br>My heart! Yes.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Finally, I will take you to the Book of Romans.
    <br>Romans 9:1.
    <br>"I speak the truth in Christ - I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit."
    <br>Today, the conscience is ignored,
    <br>which is the very instrument the Holy Spirit uses
    <br>to ride us, to push us and to guide us.
    <br>We ignore the conscience.
    <br>Today, we talk about the Holy Spirit, whereas the conscience - your heart,
    <br>which the Holy Spirit uses as a guide to the soul is ignored.
    <br>In order to pray effectively, there must not be anything between us and God.
    <br>The conscience we ignore is the very root, the very instrument the Holy Spirit uses to guide us.
    <br>So you say: "Holy, holy, holy!" whereas the heart is full of iniquity, holding grudges, holding hatred.
    <br>"Holy!.." - first talk to your heart.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit comes, if the heart is not free, it can't attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>We must allow our spirit to be free from grudges, hatred, bitterness before we can say: "Holy!"
    <br>If not, the Holy Spirit will come and move round without attending to you.
    <br>Our heart is the contact point, the communication point for the Holy Spirit
    <br>If the contact point is not free...
    <br>Your heart is the communication point; take care of your heart.
    <br>Free your heart from offence such as grudges, hatred and bitterness.
    <br>Free your heart!
    <br>You must free your heart.
    <br>Stop ignoring your heart.
    <br>It is the contact point of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Stop ignoring your heart; it's the contact point of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Contact point of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It is essential for every Christian to be free of offence.
    <br>What you are facing today is a result of offence.
    <br>Offence has opened the door to the various situations in your life.
    <br>Yes, that is offence.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Viewers, thank you.
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I was trying to counsel you yesterday concerning the issue of healing and deliverance.
    <br>It's not only healing or deliverance, help from God. If God sends you to help your neighbour,
    <br>the help that comes from the heart - we don't give that help first before you receive reward.
    <br>Let me give you a good example; issue of healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings.
    <br>No one can give money from the heart, before healing is given.
    <br>No one can give money from the heart before healing.
    <br>You can give money but that money is not from the heart.
    <br>No one can give money from the heart before healing and God's blessings.
    <br>And anything given that is not from the heart is a sin.
    <br>If you give me this and it is not  from your heart, it will not bless me.
    <br>I would use it but it will not bless my life.
    <br>But if you now give me from your heart, it will bless me and bless my future.
    <br>Money should not be exchanged for God's blessing.
    <br>If I deliver you and you are free, whatever you give me after that will come from your heart.
    <br>And it will bless my life, now and forever.
    <br>God has a way of talking to people's hearts.
    <br>Healing, deliverance and all of God's blessings are hindered by the way and manner
    <br>we go about the issue of money.
    <br>That is why you see the fire of revival is going down.
    <br>The fire of revival is going down.
    <br>When we give freely as we are given by God, God will raise His people to bless you in abundance.
    <br>When it is time for revival, it is time for sacrifice.
    <br>It's always good to sacrifice first before receiving.
    <br>Sacrifice means labour before reward. By the time reward comes, it will come in a way 
    <br>that will bless your career, your future forever.
    <br>God bless you. This is my message and I will continue to preach this anywhere.
    <br>Hallelujah!
