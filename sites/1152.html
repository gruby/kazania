  <p>    
    <br>Glory!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I will not look at your appearance, the way you dance
    <br>or the testimony you have given to judge you.
    <br>We need to examine all these.
    <br>Do you want me to judge you by your dancing, appearance, which is very admirable.
    <br>Let's look beyond that.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>That is why we are here today.
    <br>We cannot just say, "Oh my God, what a wonderful man" by mere looking at their appearance.
    <br>That is why we are here today.
    <br>You cannot just say, "Hey", because you smile.
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you for your time.
    <br>We salute your faith.
    <br>Putting everything behind and saying, "Yes, you believe - something is about to happen,
    <br>something that will change your steps, your direction, your focus".
    <br>Wow! It is going to happen.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our message today:
    <br>COMMITMENT ENHANCES FAITH
    <br>You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a total commitment.
    <br>Everywhere; what has happened in this nation, has happened in another nation.
    <br>Economic oppression, religious oppression, political oppression - everywhere.
    <br>We are still on it.
    <br>Today we will take our reading from John 15; that will be the proof text.
    <br>After reading John 15, we have some other Books that will help you;
    <br>the Book of Luke 14:26-27 - this is also very important to this message we are about to deliver today.
    <br>And the Book of Matthew 16:24.
    <br>And the Book of John 3:18 - it is also very vital, important for you.
    <br>I'm reading the Book of John as a proof text today.
    <br>If I may take the title of this text, "The World Hates The Disciples".
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>'The World Hates The Disciples'
    <br>And you are one of the disciples of Jesus, the follower of Jesus.
    <br>It means you are one of the followers.
    <br>That is just the summary of what we are about to talk about today.
    <br>So, now, I'm taking reading from verse 18.
    <br>“If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.”
    <br>Like what is happening to many of us today, "This is so much trouble".
    <br>Your Father too had similar challenges - our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>“If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own."
    <br>If you are one of the people, they will love you because you are one of them.
    <br>“As it is, you do not belong to the world."
    <br>Are you sure you are not one of them?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>“As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.”
    <br>We are in the world but we are not part of it.
    <br>If you are a follower, though you are in the world but you are not part.
    <br>That is what the Bible says here.
    <br>That is why the world hates you.
    <br>That is why they will hate you – because you are not part of it.
    <br>Everything that stands for the world...
    <br>There is a barrier between us and everything here in the world, if you are a disciple.
    <br>There is a barrier between us and everything here in the world.
    <br>We are now in verse 20.
    <br>“Remember what I told you…”
    <br>Come on - this is our Lord Jesus Christ:
    <br>“Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master’.”
    <br>Who is our master? Jesus.
    <br>Take your reading from 18 to the end.
    <br>John 3, verse 18 - very very important for you,
    <br>and Matthew 16 - that will really help you; from verse 24, you take your reading to verse 27.
    <br>Basically, with what we have read, we need to give up our life here on earth
    <br>and gain eternal life in Heaven.
    <br>There are two key words Jesus is explaining in that text.
    <br>The moment we become identified or accept Jesus as our Lord and Saviour genuinely,
    <br>take note of the word 'genuinely',
    <br>then the world will hate us.
    <br>But if you have not received it genuinely; there is a counterfeit, fake -  everybody claims to be born again...
    <br>The evidence that you received Him genuinely – the world will hate you.
    <br>That you received Jesus genuinely, truly...
    <br>You know, when they hate you - you know what it means.
    <br>The world will hate you.
    <br>The world, which is currently under satanic control, will hate you.
    <br>It will hate you in the exact, same manner it hates Jesus.
    <br>Secondly, some of us would say, why should we suffer or die, after all
    <br>Jesus won the victory on the Cross and suffered for us.
    <br>Yes, He won the victory and suffered for me and you.
    <br>But the question we need to ask ourselves: What did Jesus say in John 15:20?
    <br>Jesus said, ‘The servant is not greater than his master’.
    <br>If they had persecuted Him, they will also persecute you.
    <br>Anyone who claims he is not to suffer because Jesus did it for him,
    <br>is actually contradicting what Jesus said – opposite to what Jesus said.
    <br>Like I have said, basically, we must give up our life here on earth and gain eternal life in Heaven.
    <br>In other words:
    <br>When you receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, you are accepting citizenship in Heaven
    <br>and death here on earth.
    <br>Total commitment is what Jesus demands throughout the Gospel.
    <br>This doctrine that says, “No suffering, no health challenges, no hardship”,
    <br>is evidence that you are not really saved.
    <br>By saying, "No hardship, no health challenges..."
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet, be a candidate of Heaven, a friend of Jesus.
    <br>Allowing your situation to rule you – when you are sick, you begin to see Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>Our walking with the Lord is both good and hard times.
    <br>Yes - when the goings are good, and when the goings go the other way.
    <br>There is a lesson for good,
    <br>but the best lesson is when things are going the other way.
    <br>We learn best when things are going the other way than when things are going our way.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>We learn best when things are going the other way than when things are going our way.
    <br>Why are you here today?
    <br>You are here because things don't seem to go your way.
    <br>If things were going your way, you would likely not know T.B. Joshua today,
    <br>you would likely not be here today.
    <br>"T.B. Joshua, I need an appointment to see you. Please, give me an appointment."
    <br>It means there is no association - just an appointment.
    <br>"T.B. Joshua, hello. I would like to have an appointment to see Mr T.B. Joshua - bishop" -
    <br>this is the name they call me outside there.
    <br>"I would like to have an appointment to see Bishop T.B. Joshua"
    <br>We cannot separate warfare from salvation.
    <br>That is the problem we are facing today.
    <br>We cannot what?
    <br>True salvation will put us into direct conflict with satan.
    <br>Because there is no true salvation...
    <br>Any moment from now, when we start, they fight both physical and spiritual.
    <br>They cannot stand me spiritually, but their leg goes here - sometimes I will be like this.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What are you saying?
    <br>Because I don't tell you what I'm facing - this flesh...
    <br>By the time I start now, I will do like this.
    <br>By the time they are manifesting, you will see them.
    <br>What do you think is the reason I don't put on a tie?
    <br>If they grabbed my tie, you would likely have...
    <br>I will call you to come and rescue the situation.
    <br>Not that they intentionally do that, but they have to fight back.
    <br>It is not intentional.
    <br>By the time they realize themselves, they say, "Oh, I'm very sorry, sir".
    <br>The day you make a total commitment to Jesus, you have declared war against satan.
    <br>I said total - not that kind we declare.
    <br>You are still wining and dining with these people.
    <br>The day you make a total commitment to Jesus, you have declared war against satan.
    <br>By identifying yourself with Jesus of Nazareth, you have made yourself a bitter enemy.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>Oh how I love Jesus
    <br>Because He went for me
    <br>Once Jesus purchases you, you become aliens here on earth – strangers.
    <br>You know a stranger?
    <br>Those who are staying in a country with no stay-permit, no working permit, nothing...
    <br>Even their professor in that country - they can do any job to live.
    <br>No right to leave the country.
    <br>No matter the grade, no matter your position in your country - you are ready to do any job just to cover up.
    <br>Once Jesus purchases you, you become aliens here on earth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Once Jesus purchases you, you become aliens here on earth.
    <br>There is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.
    <br>What is the barrier?
    <br>You cannot go where Jesus will not be welcome.
    <br>There are many places the world goes you cannot go.
    <br>You must go where Jesus would be welcome.
    <br>In the world today, pretentious calm. In every circle.
    <br>A staff would enter the office to greet the chairman of the company, "Good morning, sir" -
    <br>but this is not such in heart.
    <br>After closing the door, they would do like this.
    <br>When they are doing this to the chairman of the company, "Good morning, sir",
    <br>the chairman would say, "Good morning".
    <br>He doesn't know they are deceiving him.
    <br>Many of you are working in a place where your superior, direct boss,
    <br>is someone who you know is below you - academically, in every area of life.
    <br>But what will you do?
    <br>You have to eat, and you keep greeting,
    <br>acting pretentiously as if you love him, but inside you, you are not happy.
    <br>But you need money, and you are a Christian - what kind of Christian is that?
    <br>There is a barrier between us and everything here on earth.
    <br>Once Jesus purchases us, we become aliens.
    <br>This world is not my home
    <br>I’m just passing through
    <br>My treasures are laid up
    <br>Somewhere beyond the blue
    <br>The angels beckon me 
    <br>From Heaven’s open door
    <br>And I can’t feel at home
    <br>In this world anymore
    <br>This world is not my home
    <br>I’m just passing through
    <br>My treasures are laid up
    <br>Somewhere beyond the blue
    <br>The angels beckon me 
    <br>From Heaven’s open door
    <br>And I can’t feel at home
    <br>In this world anymore
    <br>The reason why your confession and what you believe you have said in the past, have not been reflected:
    <br>you say, "Jesus. I accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour",
    <br>but one thing we must know about acceptance -
    <br>before you can be accepted, commitment asks Jesus to accept you.
    <br>You say, "Lord Jesus, here I am. I'm a sinner. Wash me with your precious blood. Save my soul" -
    <br>you drop cigarettes, you stop going to night clubs, you stop to fight, you stop envy, jealousy.
    <br>It could be at that moment; not such in heart, but at that moment you drop everything.
    <br>Until your heart accepts what you are saying - you are such in heart then.
    <br>Commitment asks Jesus to accept you.
    <br>There are many things you have done and you claim you have done and are still doing
    <br>but you are not such in heart.
    <br>That is why if you drop cigarettes, "Lord Jesus, accept me. I will follow Jesus." - you stop cigarettes
    <br>but in your dream, you keep smoking cigarettes.
    <br>When you dream, they will give you cigarettes.
    <br>By the time you wake up, you will feel the odour in your mouth - you will know you smoked cigarettes.
    <br>"That is not for me" - but this keeps happening to you in the dream.
    <br>You stop drinking but you find yourself drinking in your dream.
    <br>You are a type that womanises; you have stopped it,
    <br>because you have accepted Jesus as your Lord and Saviour
    <br>but in your dream - 20 women, 20 men, because you are not such in heart.
    <br>That is why these things will continue to reflect.
    <br>That is the word "commitment" we are talking about.
    <br>Commitment asks Jesus to accept you.
    <br>Commitment now stands as a bridge, a link, a go-between,
    <br>as an intermediary between us and Jesus.
    <br>Commitment means, mean it with all your heart.
    <br>The moment you make a commitment, you are going to be tested and tried on it,
    <br>to be sure that you really mean what you are saying.
    <br>Yes, faithfulness, "I'm faithful" - test will come to show if you are real, or you are faking yourself.
    <br>The moment you make a commitment, you are going to be tested and tried on it.
    <br>When you stand on your commitment throughout testing,
    <br>Jesus will give you more and more faith as you go along.
    <br>You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a commitment.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a commitment.
    <br>Faith is a pure gift from God.
    <br>You cannot grow in faith if you don’t make a commitment.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>Where are we going now?
    <br>At this point you should be able to know if you are a Christian, or you are about to be.
    <br>As a Christian, a believer, a pastor, a bishop, a prophet,
    <br>in every step, in every move, intimation must come -
    <br>a suggestion must come to us from the Spirit that the action be performed.
    <br>I'm facing you; you see me facing you - I must hear intimation,
    <br>"Move. Leave the place. Turn back."
    <br>There must be a corresponding power.
    <br>A suggestion must come to us from the Spirit.
    <br>That is why sometimes, when I behave here, you say, "What is wrong with this man?"
    <br>There is nothing wrong with me.
    <br>I am a servant.
    <br>I cannot dictate the kind of direction, the kind of position or what to say.
    <br>I cannot decide what suffering to bear.
    <br>I am a servant, an alien – a stranger here on earth.
    <br>You have to listen to your Master – Someone who is controlling you.
    <br>But today, you see the way you behave, the way you talk,
    <br>"Please, if you don't leave that place, I will show you".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You draw a time-table for the week - from now till next Friday;
    <br>what you want to do tomorrow, after tomorrow; you iron your different attire now -
    <br>I will wear this on Monday, I will wear this on Tuesday, Friday.
    <br>How do you know that you will live to see those days,
    <br>when you are an alien, a stranger, a servant?
    <br>How do you know you will live to wear all these dresses?
    <br>That is one of the big insults we often give to God.
    <br>Embarrassment - it is one of the biggest embarrassments to decide what you will do tomorrow,
    <br>after tomorrow.
    <br>What is the position of God?
    <br>We own now; God owns our future.
    <br>You take over today, He takes over our future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our lives have been like that because of knowledge of senses,
    <br>which is not creative.
    <br>The day you wake up and say, "Oh God; next - I don't know - over to you God" -
    <br>then you are a follower of Jesus.
    <br>The fear of God will be there.
    <br>Just wake up and say, "Ah!"
    <br>They call you.
    <br>- "Hello. Will you come and see me tomorrow?"
    <br>- "I don't know. I'm a servant of God."
    <br>- "Hello. The meeting is next Tuesday. What time are you leaving home?"
    <br>- "I'm sorry, I'm an alien, a stranger. I need to hear from above to know whether I will see tomorrow."
    <br>Then, you are a child of God, you begin to live great to represent God.
    <br>There are some lives we are supposed to prepare, to begin to live, to reset your future.
    <br>The whole thing is upside down.
    <br>You can start it now; leave your next for God - when I say next, I mean second.
    <br>Now, you can do whatever you want to do - it is over to you, because you give account to God.
    <br>You can do whatever you want to do; you can beat your brother - remember you will give account,
    <br>but next - next means future...
    <br>God owns our future; now is ours.
    <br>Now, the Lord can say to mamma here, "Please, come along with me".
    <br>You may say, "No", because He gives us discretion.
    <br>That is why He asked that man at the pool of Bethesda, "What can I do for you?"
    <br>"What can I do for you?"
    <br>He is supposed to say, "Please, rise and walk".
    <br>He said, "What can I do for you?", because He knows there is discretion.
    <br>The man could say, "Leave me. I don't need anything from you".
    <br>In the same way, as you are on the seat, the Lord can ask you, "Leave there",
    <br>you say, "No, I will not leave".
    <br>He is not going to do anything to you, He knows you will give account for your disobedience.
    <br>You will give account for your disobedience in the future.
    <br>Account is future; you will give account in the future, but now is yours.
    <br>You can start your life by leaving that future, next to God.
    <br>All those plans that you have already - it is an embarrassment.
    <br>Start that practice today.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I want to see you tomorrow".
    <br>And your neighbour should say, "Look, I'm a stranger, a servant - I need to consult my Boss".
    <br>And who is your Boss?
    <br>Tell your neighbour now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>- "I want to see you tomorrow."
    <br>- "I'm an alien, a servant."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
