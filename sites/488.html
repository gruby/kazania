    <br>We want to pray for our nation.
    <br>Hold up your flag.
    <br>We want to begin by first asking for the mercy and forgiveness of God.
    <br>After that, we will ask God, every weapon of bondage on your nation,
    <br>on the economy of your nation,
    <br>politics of your nation,
    <br>just name all areas of your nation.
    <br>We ask God to release your nation from that bondage.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and ask for mercy.
    <br>Raise your flag above you.
    <br>You want to ask for mercy.
    <br>Let the mercy of God and favour of God speak for your nation.
