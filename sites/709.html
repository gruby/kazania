    <br>The footage your are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and may not be suitable for all viewers but it is for the glory of God.
    <br>58 year-old Mr Omotosho Kareem, from Oyo State, Nigeria,
    <br>has come to The SCOAN with the deadly problem of throat cancer.
    <br>This is the medical report from Lagos University Teaching Hospital,
    <br>showing the diagnosis of his ailment.
    <br>Imagine how this problem has affected his daily life,
    <br>not being able to eat or speak, and the terrible odour that would be coming out of his mouth.
    <br>He has come to The SCOAN with the belief that Jesus Christ can supernaturally heal him
    <br>and bring life in abundance.
    <br>The camera zooms into Omotoshu Kareem's mouth,
    <br>showing a severe spreading of the throat cancer,
    <br>and swelling to the extent that it has closed the passage of his mouth.
    <br>The pain is unbearable.
    <br>Only a divine touch from Jesus Christ can reverse this problem.
    <br>Mr Omotosho Kareem awaits at the prayer line in hope for Jesus Christ to divinely come to his aid
    <br>and rescue him from the claws of sickness.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>and the power of healing falls upon him
    <br>and breaks the yoke of throat cancer in his life.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Praise the Living Jesus!
    <br>My name is Mr Kareem Omotosho.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN to thank God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>If not for the God of T.B. Joshua, I would not have been able to talk like this.
    <br>I would have joined them in the graveyard.
    <br>Back in December 2015, it started as if a small bone got stuck in my throat.
    <br>I started running from one place to another.
    <br>I went to many hospitals, including Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
    <br>When I got there, they diagnosed it and told me that it was cancer of the throat and mouth.
    <br>I said, "Wow, what will I do?"
    <br>One day, I was at the doctor, and he told me that this growth was fast growing
    <br>and that they had no option than to operate on my throat and insert a pipe.
    <br>They had to do it because I couldn't use my mouth to do anything.
    <br>I went home and decided that I have to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>At that time, what were the things you could no longer do with your mouth? Were you able to talk?
    <br>How difficult was it at that time?
    <br>I could not eat anything or swallow.
    <br>I could only take watery pap ( liquid food).
    <br>Were you able to talk?
    <br>I couldn't talk. I even smelt bad.
    <br>When I entered a bus, people would complain that something was smelling.
    <br>They would say, "Who brought something rotten?"
    <br>When I entered a bus, I would sit by the window,
    <br>so I could put my mouth outside because of the smell.
    <br>Many people rejected me because they knew, and even I knew that I was going to die.
    <br>There was no way out; I vomited blood every day.
    <br>I then decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I thank the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When I was placed on the prayer line, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me.
    <br>Instantly, the saliva that had been uncontrollable stopped.
    <br>Shall we put out hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Before you came to The SCOAN to receive prayer from the man of God,
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua, at the prayer line, you were constantly dropping saliva uncontrollably?
    <br>I always carried a towel with me because it was uncontrollable. I tried to control it, but couldn't.
    <br>It came out like water every minute.
    <br>The first thing that happened to me - the saliva stopped.
    <br>My body calmed down.
    <br>I thought that pieces of the meat (tumour) would come out but instead it melted away.
    <br>I didn't see it any longer. That's how the cancer disappeared from my life.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We can see you talking now.
    <br>So you mean you could not even express yourself?
    <br>I couldn't.
    <br>If I wanted to communicate to anyone around, I had to write it on a piece of paper.
    <br>I couldn't talk.
    <br>And all the pain you used to have?
    <br>It was not a small pain.
    <br>What you watched - you would understand what I am saying.
    <br>The pain was so much I couldn't control it.
    <br>I thank God today that everything (cancer) is over in my life.
    <br>See the left side of the screen.
    <br>See how terrible it was. It was spreading from inside the mouth down to the throat.
    <br>He could no longer do things for himself.
    <br>Eating was a problem, he could not talk.
    <br>Pain and agony day and night.
    <br>He said that when he was placed at the prayer line, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>prayed for him, as you can see on the left side of the screen. That's the same man.
    <br>After the prayer by the man of God, he was completely set free.
    <br>Right now, can you open your mouth and let us see?
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Mr Kareem Omotosho - Healed Of Throat And Mouth Cancer
    <br>Once again, put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Look at the left side of your screen - that was his condition when he first came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Right now on the right side of the screen, you can see his testimony.
    <br>All the cancerous growth is gone.
    <br>Now his mouth is normal and his throat is free of cancer.
    <br>Now you can eat very well?
    <br>I can eat, I can do anything.
    <br>Once again, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>People all over the world and the people that are here - in any situation you find yourself,
    <br>please run to God because it is only in God that you can find hope.
    <br>I had lost hope.
    <br>My family had said that they wanted to take me to the village.
    <br>They knew it would be cheaper to put me in a vehicle to take me to my village
    <br>than dying here and then take me to my village.
    <br>So they wanted to take me there.
    <br>If not that I ran to God, what would I have done?
    <br>In any situation, problem, just run to God and you will be saved.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>To God be the glory! Watch your screen!
    <br>Viewers out there, you can see the comparison between the shot on the left side of the screen
    <br>and on the right side of the Screen.
    <br>This man testified that no one around him believed that he would survive.
    <br>He himself had the thought and the belief in his heart that he was going to die
    <br>because he was no longer functioning like someone living in the land of the living.
    <br>Glory be to God, he came to the right place, at the right time and met the right person -
    <br>the anointed Prophet of God who waved his hand towards him and the miracle happened.
    <br>Now, he is alive today to share that testimony.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Mr Kareem Omotosho - Healed Of Throat And Mouth Cancer
    <br>My advice to the whole world is that when there is a problem, don't look at people.
    <br>Just run to God because Jesus Christ is the only hope.
    <br>So, please run to God.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the only hope.
    <br>The Bible says that Jesus Christ is the answer to all fundamental issues of life -
    <br>be it sickness, setback, poverty, failure, barrenness.
    <br>Whatever it is, run to Jesus and you will receive a solution.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>We also want to encourage you that the healing you have received is for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>The only way you can maintain this healing is to make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to make God's Word the standard of your life,
    <br>in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you. Once again, put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>I want to take up the issue of the gentleman who testified here.
    <br>With the case of cancer. I want us to look again at that case.
    <br>If cancer on any part of the body remains uncured,
    <br>how can you manage the one on the tongue that would not have the grace to enjoy the air.
    <br>You understand that when something somewhere is bleeding, it's always difficult to cure
    <br>because air is healing; you can take it up.
    <br>He did not have grace for the air
    <br>but he is cured by mere waving hand.
    <br>Your situation will be cured!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Your situation is cured!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>If you have that faith, take one - your situation will be cured!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Your situation is cured!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Which one is yours?
    <br>Your situation will be cured!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Your situation is cured!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>You can't claim the two.
    <br>You can't belong to the two.
    <br>You belong to one.
    <br>You have to stand up now. Let me know the one you are waiting for.
    <br>If you stand up, when the situation is not yours, you sit down.
    <br>When the situation is yours, you stand up.
    <br>Your situation will be cured!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Your situation is cured!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated. Let's watch!
    <br>Mr Omotosho Kareem awaits at the prayer line
    <br>in hope for Jesus Christ to divinely come to his aid
    <br>and rescue him from the claws of sickness.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>and the power of healing falls upon him
    <br>and breaks the yoke of throat cancer in his life.
    <br>You can see it clear.
    <br>Can you see it clear?
    <br>This is the kind of thing you are supposed to put on your phone
    <br>and that will enhance your faith.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Any time you are disturbed, you would remember the Healer.
    <br>There is a time to be disturbed, and a time to be happy.
    <br>A time to be what? - (disturbed)
    <br>And a time to be what? - (happy)
    <br>Yes, any time you are disturbed, you play it to yourself
    <br>so that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>So that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.
    <br>Tell your neighbor again:
    <br>So that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>So that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.
    <br>Again !
    <br>So that you would be able to cope with hard and good moments.
    <br>It's only like that, you see me...
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Hard
    <br>Good
    <br>Hard
    <br>Good
    <br>Good and Hard
    <br>Don't say, until you have pain in your leg, before you realise that you are going through good and hard times.
    <br>Don't say, until there is no money in the pocket,
    <br>before you recognise that you are going through hard and good times.
    <br>Don't say, until you have no food on the table,
    <br>before you recognise that life is all about hard and good moments.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>Life is all about hard and good moments.
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>Life is all about hard and good moments.
    <br>Again!
    <br>Life is all about hard and good moments.
    <br>How do we know this?
    <br>We know this through the thoughts in our hearts.
    <br>There is a conflict going on.
    <br>There is a conflict going on in your heart.
    <br>As you are sitting down, there is a conflict going on in your heart.
    <br>"No", "yes".
    <br>"Ok, let me go!"
    <br>"When it is 12 o'clock, I will leave!"
    <br>The thought of your heart.
    <br>You know your heart is a prayer room.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>A Christian's heart is a prayer room.
    <br>A believer's heart is a prayer room.
    <br>It is a prayer room; that is the altar.
    <br>If your prayer is not from that place, whatever you are saying, you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>The prayer must come from the altar, prayer room.
    <br>If your prayer is not from your heart, you are just talking to the air.
    <br>This is why you doubt yourself because what you are saying is not from your heart.
    <br>You are bound to doubt yourself.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, heal me!"
    <br>The doubt comes when you are not healed because that prayer is not from your heart.
    <br>If your prayer comes from the prayer room - the heart - you cannot doubt yourself.
    <br>You would believe!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Am I talking to you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A believer's heart is the prayer room.
    <br>So, you keep doubting yourself.
    <br>Anytime you take a decision, doubt comes -
    <br>whether to do it or not to do it;
    <br>whether to pay the money or not to pay the money.
    <br>You get confused.
    <br>It's about the decision; it's about doubt.
    <br>When it's about decision, doubt comes
    <br>because what you are saying is not from your heart.
    <br>Your heart is the prayer room, the altar.
    <br>When the prayer is not from the altar, whatever you are saying, you are saying it to the air.
    <br>That's what we call, saying words, praying prayer.
    <br>So, now..
    <br>Stop measuring your Christian life by your situation.
    <br>In this case, your situation should not mislead you.
    <br>That you are poor does not mean you cannot be a Christian.
    <br>We always attach that, whatever happens to you - sin.
    <br>No!
    <br>Sin also brings reproach - we agree!
    <br>But, sometimes, a situation like this can be used to draw you close (to God).
    <br>You should agree with me that it's your situation that brought you here today.
    <br>If you didn't have that situation, you would have unlikely come here.
    <br>Our situation strengthens our desire and determination for Christ.
    <br>Ok, now.
    <br>You have seen that gentleman, after he has been to many places.
    <br>He has spent all his fortune.
    <br>He could not eat, he could not talk.
    <br>They wanted to operate on him in order to pass the food through the stomach.
    <br>So then, he came to Jesus.
    <br>If there is anything that can draw your attention to Christ most, this is it.
    <br>No amount of message...
    <br>We have many theologians here.
    <br>We have many people that have gone through the Bible many times in a year.
    <br>This is a human being just like you.
    <br>Assume you are in this situation.
    <br>You cannot talk; you cannot eat.
    <br>This had become a curse, it was no longer a sickness.
    <br>There is a difference between sickness and curse.
    <br>If a situation becomes a curse, who can stop the curse?
    <br>Only Jesus.
    <br>Sickness and disease can be treated by human beings, medical doctors,
    <br>you, whatever, tablets, drugs.
    <br>When you take it, if it's sickness, it will be treated.
    <br>This is the meaning of 'Doctor treats; God heals'.
    <br>Sickness demands for treatment.
    <br>Curse demands for healing.
    <br>Who can heal? Only God.
    <br>Doctors can treat - you can treat as a medical doctor.
    <br>This one, the more he is treated, the more the damage.
    <br>Let's see the healing - before and after.
    <br>Mr Kareem Omotosho - Healed Of Throat And Mouth Cancer
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>So over to you - dentists, doctors; you can meet a man like him.
    <br>Begin to take care of the stitch and wash his tongue.
    <br>Sometimes when our teeth are too bad, it can cause anything.
    <br>Can we ask you - how did you manage?
    <br>After the healing, the first thing I noticed was that the uncontrollable saliva stopped.
    <br>When you were facing this problem, were you able to eat or talk?
    <br>I could not eat or do anything.
    <br>Even whenever I drank a little bit of water, it felt like fire.
    <br>I could not talk.
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>What did the doctor tell you before you ran to the church?
    <br>They said there was nothing they could do about it.
    <br>They called me and told me that the cancerous growth was growing fast.
    <br>They said they needed to operate on my throat and insert a pipe.
    <br>They noticed that I couldn't breathe well any longer.
    <br>They wanted to operate on my throat and insert a pipe for me to be breathing through.
    <br>After the prayer here, the first day, the second day,
    <br>the first week, the second week, what happened? Can you tell us the procedure, the process?
    <br>After the prayer, the excess saliva stopped and I started seeing changes.
    <br>Everything started drying up.
    <br>Food I could not eat before, I started asking them to give me.
    <br>People around me were surprised that I was eating.
    <br>How the whole thing disappeared, I didn't realise it; it just dried up like that.
    <br>I could not talk before. When I wanted to communicate, I had to write.
    <br>Now, I can talk.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Mr Kareem Omotosho - Healed Of Throat And Mouth Cancer
    <br>You see?
    <br>Thank you.
