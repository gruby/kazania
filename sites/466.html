    <br>How LUCIFER Taught Me MASTURBATION...
    <br>Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua ministering prayer at The SCOAN prayer line
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The kingdom of darkness is being exposed by the light and fire of God
    <br>and the evil spirits bow to the supreme authority of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let us watch how a young lady receives the touch
    <br>and the demon within her manifests and confesses its evil mission.
    <br>You destroyed my kingdom!
    <br>I want to destroy my youth.
    <br>Darkness!
    <br>I have no business with you people.
    <br>You destroy; you provoked me!
    <br>You provoked my kingdom.
    <br>I am to destroy the youth.
    <br>I want the youth; I want to destroy their lives.
    <br>I want to destroy their future.
    <br>- How do you operate?
    <br>- In many ways.
    <br>Number one?
    <br>Facebook - my facebook.
    <br>How do you use facebook to destroy the youth?
    <br>You expose our kingdom.
    <br>My agencies are there.
    <br>Lucifer is by our side.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>King's family - that's their family.
    <br>She receives her deliverance as Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for her,
    <br>and the demons submit to the power of God.
    <br>Grateful, she thanks Jesus Christ for His mercy.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Christy, I'm from Namibia.
    <br>I was delivered from the spirit of lucifer that entered me through Facebook.
    <br>Actually, when I grew up, from a young age, I didn't have a desire for men.
    <br>So, I developed a spirit of masturbation since I was seven years old.
    <br>That spirit really destroyed me a lot.
    <br>What I would do to masturbate was cross my legs; after that, I would masturbate.
    <br>In an hour, I could masturbate three times.
    <br>Every time I crossed my legs, I felt a sensation as if somebody was sleeping with me;
    <br>I would feel satisfied as if I had really slept with somebody.
    <br>That made me not to have a desire for men.
    <br>So, you would feel as if a spiritual being was actually sleeping with you each time you masturbated
    <br>and because of that, you had no interest in men whatsoever.
    <br>Yes, I felt like somebody was really sleeping with me.
    <br>As you grew older, tell us more about how this pushed you in terms of the type of life you began to live.
    <br>Then, I began to become a model
    <br>whereby, I went on Facebook and had two accounts.
    <br>One was for the modelling profile while the other one was a fake account that I had.
    <br>One was a local one and the other was the fake account.
    <br>On the fake account, I didn't have any local people or African friends;
    <br>it was focused on the international world.
    <br>I began to encounter an Indian guy who claimed to be an agent
    <br>who helped African girls to get into modelling.
    <br>When I went into casting, he made me go onto Skype and strip for him;
    <br>I went naked for him and did all the moves that models did.
    <br>After that, it was like I gained more power in my eyes to seduce
    <br>and flirt with men; the concentration was mainly on men.
    <br>This man, who claimed to be an Indian man, you never met him physically,
    <br>but on Facebook, through web camera he asked you to take off all of your clothes.
    <br>As you were doing this as the man was instructing you, what happened to you?
    <br>I felt like I was passing a test and getting promoted to the next level;
    <br>I felt like I was qualifying more in moves of how to seduce and flirt.
    <br>How did it push you to live your life in terms of the way you related with people,
    <br>the way you related with men?
    <br>What type of life did this lead you to live?
    <br>Actually, the interest in men was not there;
    <br>the mission that I wanted more was just to destroy them.
    <br>If I saw three men approaching me, two would be interested in me.
    <br>Those ones - I would not mind them because I had already accomplished what I wanted.
    <br>I would concentrate on the one that didn't have interest in me;
    <br>I would feel more provoked about why he didn't fall for me.
    <br>I would work on him to the point that I could get his contact details from the others
    <br>and then, I will get him to the point where he would ask me out.
    <br>When he would ask me out, I would just walk away.
    <br>So, I was not interested in a relationship, I just wanted to destroy.
    <br>So, you derived joy in seeing people sad, or cry, especially men?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>It was like I was on a mission to see them cry, to be the one who was on top,
    <br>to control them like that.
    <br>We can understand; what our sister is saying is that this evil spirit that was within her
    <br>wanted to see people around her cry, sad, in pain, in anguish.
    <br>Specifically with male relationships;
    <br>even though she had no interest in actually meeting the men,
    <br>she just wanted to break their hearts, after beginning a relationship with her,
    <br>just so that she could see them in pain, as a result of that evil spirit that was within her.
    <br>As you were going about this -
    <br>tell us more about the type of things that would be going through your mind, your heart
    <br>on a daily basis because of this evil spirit.
    <br>Because of this evil spirit, I thought of more evil,
    <br>of ways how to hate people more and how to see them cry more.
    <br>I could be seated but my mind would just be set on evil.
    <br>I felt that it was a daily work that I had to do;
    <br>I didn't know any good, like doing the right thing.
    <br>In the spiritual world, I would see myself flying over oceans and seas.
    <br>I would see myself in a group of people having meetings
    <br>but I didn't really know what we talked about.
    <br>I would encounter a strange man.
    <br>His body was like a human being's but his head was a mixture of a monster
    <br>and different creatures, who would be proposing to me for marriage and he would have two rings.
    <br>On another side, I would find myself saying yes to the person
    <br>and then after, I would say no.
    <br>So, spiritually our sister was interacting with these demons
    <br>and physically this was how it pushed her to live that type of life.
    <br>You mentioned after encountering this Indian man, you felt as if there were some powers,
    <br>that you had in your eyes to be able to seduce or to manipulate.
    <br>Can you just explain more about how this affected you, how you used these powers
    <br>in your relationships with people?
    <br>It was like my eyes were the point of contact.
    <br>When I wanted somebody to do something for me,
    <br>my eyes would speak first, then my voice.
    <br>I would read the mind of a person and what I would tell them -
    <br>what they would answer - I would already know.
    <br>We just ask you these questions for us to learn some valuable lessons.
    <br>Our sister, at this point was under the influence of this evil spirit, that she was delivered from last week
    <br>and to her it was a normal life, a life she was living,
    <br>as a result of the evil spirit that was within her right from a very young age.
    <br>Sister, you mentioned that you were into modelling at that time.
    <br>Can you tell us more about the type of dangers that were posed, as a model,
    <br>for example how people were using Facebook to put models like yourself
    <br>into serious trouble through Facebook.
    <br>Just explain more about that.
    <br>You would find international people who claimed to be agents.
    <br>They would look for African girls who were more desperate to get famous.
    <br>They would send you a proposal; what they would say was you were coming to model
    <br>or do a photo shoot in their country.
    <br>They would say that they would sponsor everything and then, after you got there,
    <br>you would find yourself doing nudity because you didn't have a choice;
    <br>they were paying for everything.
    <br>That I encountered in my fellow colleagues.
    <br>These are some of the pictures from when I used to model.
    <br>Mostly, I could use that in any way that I wanted
    <br>because most men are very weak; when they see the way you're dressed,
    <br>just on the appearance, they are already falling for you.
    <br>So, these are the types of pictures you would put on Facebook to seduce men
    <br>and to get them to have contact with you, before deciding to break their hearts?
    <br>Yes, exactly.
    <br>Sister, tell us; when you came to The SCOAN last week and during the prayer line -
    <br>tell us your experience, what happened to you.
    <br>Firstly, I was really looking forward for the man of God to touch me
    <br>and then after he got closer to me, I felt like I was facing an enemy.
    <br>After the deliverance, I felt like something that was part of me
    <br>for a long time had left me and I felt relieved, the way I was thinking -
    <br>I was no longer thinking the same.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You said, as Prophet T.B. Joshua approached, you felt like you were seeing an enemy.
    <br>Can you just describe more about that feeling?
    <br>What you remember happening at that moment, as we were seeing on the screen?
    <br>Now, I can tell that between Mr T.B. Joshua and Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>there is a difference because when I met Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>at the prayer line, I felt like I was meeting an enemy,
    <br>somebody who was there to destroy me.
    <br>I felt like fighting him.
    <br>Then, after that was when I felt relieved; everything was over.
    <br>I even have a best friend now who is controlling my mind.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Tell us sister; ever since your deliverance last week,
    <br>by God's grace you have been here in the presence of God -
    <br>tell us the changes in your life, mind, heart, dreams - just tell us the changes.
    <br>After my deliverance, the evil thoughts were trying to come back
    <br>but the moment they are coming back it was like they were cut off
    <br>before they could even get to what they were trying to do.
    <br>Even when I was close to a person and the person started talking to me,
    <br>I would see that what they were trying to say to me what was not right,
    <br>I would start counting my faith.
    <br>It is like it was inviting me; it was part of me.
    <br>You are referring to the Faith Bracelet you received last week?
    <br>Yes. Sometimes, it would feel like I no longer held a Faith Bracelet;
    <br>it was like I had a heart that I was teaching in my hand.
    <br>It was like my heart was out and it was the one I was having in my hand.
    <br>So, I would meditate and it would teach me.
    <br>OK. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>And in terms of your dreams, how have you been sleeping since your deliverance - tell us the changes.
    <br>I am overcoming spirits; it is like Scriptures are fighting for me.
    <br>There was a time I encountered ancestral spirits, they were coming,
    <br>dead people were coming to me but after that,
    <br>I would just see Scriptures were just coming to me.
    <br>Between the dead people and the living, there is no relationship.
    <br>They just disappeared like that.
    <br>Wow. Indeed, that shows that you are indeed delivered and you are an overcomer in Christ.
    <br>You said before your heart was always thinking of evil, of how to destroy.
    <br>How is your mind right now, after the deliverance?
    <br>Right now, I feel happy - all I want is to see people happy and smiling
    <br>because I know when there is God, there is joy.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time
    <br>for this wonderful deliverance of our sister.
    <br>What would be your advice to viewers around the world, especially young people?
    <br>We saw in the deliverance that the demon that was within you specifically said
    <br>that it wants to destroy the youth of today
    <br>and that it was using mediums such a Facebook and the internet to achieve that purpose.
    <br>Now, you are delivered - what is your advice to youth around the world?
    <br>Youth is the center of attraction.
    <br>When you go to the internet -
    <br>on Facebook, mainly, there is something waiting to swallow you.
    <br>So, you should be careful of the kind of requests you accept.
    <br>Sometimes, you see the profile of a person and you don't know what is behind him.
    <br>To young men, you should not be deceived by the look.
    <br>Miss Christy Hangula
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>To women, it's not that I am saying that they should take care of their children
    <br>but they should pray more for them.
    <br>You only know your child because you gave birth to them
    <br>but you really don't know them.
    <br>I think that is a very important word of advice from our sister.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So, our sister is simply advising us all to be very careful, especially when going on the internet,
    <br>using such social media as Facebook
    <br>because you don't know the person you are meeting,
    <br>whether they are actually a human being, or indeed someone influenced by evil spirits,
    <br>that would use that mechanism to bring destruction into your life.
    <br>We pray that God would give you the grace to maintain this wonderful deliverance.
    <br>And we know that the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Miss Christy Hangula
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>After sharing her testimony and experience Miss Christy Hangula is now going back to her country
    <br>to start her new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>I have stayed here for so many weeks now.
    <br>I attended a lot of classes.
    <br>Everything was a spiritual benefit.
    <br>I really appreciate everything that has been going on.
    <br>Now, I can think straight and I can think about what I want to do in my life.
    <br>I can design but I had just been designing for fun.
    <br>I never knew that I could do it.
    <br>Now, I can think straight and I am looking forward to what I can do with my life.
    <br>It is like a new page for my life has been opened.
    <br>I really thank Jesus.
    <br>I don't deserve all this.
    <br>It is just the grace of God.
    <br>I never knew that a sinner like me deserved an opportunity like this.
    <br>I don't know how to explain this grace.
    <br>Nigeria and the man of God has been great.
    <br>I learnt how to have humility in this place - no matter who you are,
    <br>no matter what class you are, humility attracts God more.
    <br>I have learnt how to please God, not men.
    <br>I have learnt a lot of things and when I go back to my country
    <br>I really want by God's grace the fruits of my deliverance to grow.
    <br>Not only one person contributed to my deliverance but a lot of people helped me out.
    <br>And the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua heard about this and he said
    <br>that along with the Emmanuel TV partners, he wants to give you this gift of $ 1,000
    <br>to enable you to go to the school you want to go to and establish yourself.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners bless Miss Christy Hangula
    <br>with the sum of $ 1,000 to start her new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>I really thank God for this.
    <br>I never even thought I deserved this.
    <br>It is like He redesigned my life.
    <br>Jesus Christ Himself used Prophet T.B. Joshua to set out my life
    <br>in a different way - spiritually and now, financially.
    <br>I know that Jesus Christ is the Founder of my destiny.
    <br>I just want to say thank You, Jesus, The SCOAN, The Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>and everyone around here.
    <br>I'm really grateful.
    <br>I never encountered any problem.
    <br>I love you all.
    <br>Amen. And we pray that God Almighty will give you the grace
    <br>to maintain this wonderful deliverance you have received
    <br>and to continue to keep the Word of God in your mind, your mouth, in every conversation,
    <br>so that the Word of God will guide you in all your endeavors
    <br>and you will come back with an even greater testimony, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Praise Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>I am going home but Nigeria has become my spiritual home.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
