    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature and although it may be not suitable for all viewers,
    <br>it is for the glory of God.
    <br>Mr Jacob Apachi has come to The SCOAN with the problem of a terrible leg ulcer due to diabetes.
    <br>You can see how so many flies have ravaged the decomposing leg
    <br>because it has been medically confirmed for amputation.
    <br>Due to this terrible stigma, Jacob will definitely not be able to live among men, but only in isolation,
    <br>because of the stench that continuously emits from the leg.
    <br>Imagine the shame and embarrassment he would be going through.
    <br>But Jesus Christ is the Friend that sticks closer than a brother.
    <br>Also imagine the excruciating pain he would be experiencing, as a result of this problem,
    <br>because an attempt to lift the leg, or even walk would be an unbearable burden.
    <br>I am Jacob Apachi.
    <br>I am from Cross River State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am 39 years old.
    <br>The problem that brought me here is leg ulcer due to diabetes.
    <br>How has this problem affected your life?
    <br>It has affected my life in the sense that I cannot go out or move anywhere.
    <br>I can no longer take care of my family.
    <br>They have to assist me anytime I want to go to the toilet.
    <br>I have been to many hospitals and witch doctors
    <br>but cannot find a solution to this problem.
    <br>I said, since I have been watching Emmanuel TV, let me come here;
    <br>that will be my final bus stop.
    <br>Now that you are here today, what do you believe God Almighty will do for you?
    <br>I believe that God will heal me.
    <br>Amen. We pray that God Almighty will heal you of leg ulcer due to diabetes, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>If you believe today, your past is over, in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, be healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>After receiving prayer in Jesus' name, Jacob stands up and begins to walk.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>A short time later, Jacob came to show what the name of Jesus Christ has done in his life.
    <br>This is a radical transformation - the great Physician Jesus Christ has done it again.
    <br>Taking a look on the left side of the screen,
    <br>we can see how he came with the terrible, fly infested leg ulcer due to diabetes.
    <br>And looking on the right side of the screen, we can see the perfectly healed leg, without pain or discomfort.
    <br>The ulcer has dried up and now covered with fresh skin.
    <br>There is never a sickness Jesus Christ cannot heal, never a burden He cannot bear, never a problem He cannot solve
    <br>and never a friend like Jesus Christ.
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty. We can see your leg today. Can you tap it very well and show us how you are feeling?
    <br>I can tap it very well.
    <br>I don't feel pain any more.
    <br>Rub it again. How are you feeling, sir?
    <br>I don't feel pain any more. I am healed now!
    <br>Before now, could you tap it and rub it the way you are doing it now?
    <br>I could not put my hand close to it before.
    <br>I could not touch it before.
    <br>As you are touching your leg now, do you feel any pain or discomfort?
    <br>I don't feel any pain any more. I can now go back to my business.
    <br>Could you wear your sandals or shoes before when you came with this problem?
    <br>I came to Lagos wearing only boxers.
    <br>I could not wear trousers or sandals.
    <br>We can see a pair of sandals next to you.
    <br>Can you put them on, for the glory of God, and show us how are you after the healing?
    <br>I can now wear my shoes.
    <br>Mr Jacob Apachi takes his shoes and begins to put them on.
    <br>This was what ordinarily he could not do before now.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Watch DECAYED FLESH Suddenly Transform!!!
    <br>Before, I could not put on my sandals or slippers
    <br>but now, I am healed, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>This is a tremendous miracle, and indeed, it is marvellous in our eyes.
    <br>The man is here right now with his family,
    <br>and they are so full of emotions, because the Lord has solved their problem.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Jacob Apachi
    <br>Healed Of Leg Ulcer Due To Diabetes
    <br>My name is Jacob Apachi.
    <br>I am from Cross River State, but I reside in Benue State.
    <br>The woman beside me is my lovely wife and these are my lovely children.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a leg ulcer due to diabetes.
    <br>I started experiencing this when I was urinating constantly for three days.
    <br>The next thing, I felt like scratching my leg.
    <br>After scratching it, it developed into a blister and from there, the leg started swelling.
    <br>I went to hospital and the doctors said that it was diabetes
    <br>and it was a very dangerous issue that could not be cured easily.
    <br>The doctor showed me the dark area of my leg and said the only thing
    <br>they could do for me was to amputate the leg at my knee and that if I refused,
    <br>it would develop to the stage of affecting my kidneys and as a result, I would die.
    <br>I said, "No".
    <br>We started looking for a solution and moved from one witch doctor to another.
    <br>At one stage, a witch doctor took my money, cooked some dirty things and gave me.
    <br>I almost ate a frog.
    <br>The next thing he told me was that only God could solve my case.
    <br>Then, I saw my bone and that one of my veins had been cut.
    <br>I cried and started thinking of where I would run to.
    <br>My wife said that there was still hope and that we should try The SCOAN.
    <br>I said, "Okay, let us go."
    <br>Almost three to four hotels rejected me here in Lagos.
    <br>The driver had to hide me outside in order to book a hotel before they could take me in.
    <br>Before people saw me, they would smell the odour and the whole place would be polluted.
    <br>There was nothing I could do.
    <br>If they started talking about it, my wife would cry.
    <br>I would ask her why she was crying and she would say she heard what people were saying.
    <br>We came to The SCOAN as God would have it. Prophet T.B. Joshua and one of the wise men prayed for me.
    <br>Before they could say, 'In the name of Jesus Christ, be healed',
    <br>I felt a touch on my body like an electric shock.
    <br>I rose up.
    <br>Before I came to Lagos, I was carried everywhere and was not able to walk.
    <br>I had a pair of crutches but could not use them.
    <br>But with God's mercy upon me, I rose up immediately.
    <br>I, who was carried from the hotel to The SCOAN and was not able to walk,
    <br>before the taxi dropped me outside the hotel, greeted the owner of the hotel and she did not recognize me.
    <br>Seeing my wife dancing behind me, she asked, "Is this not the lady who came here and was crying?".
    <br>My wife said, "Yes, the Lord has solved the problem."
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>You can see the reason why the whole family has decided to come to share their testimony.
    <br>This is the man whose leg would have been amputated and would have been handicapped, a one-legged person,
    <br>but to the glory of God, God set him free.
    <br>This leg had been medically destined for amputation, but to the glory of God, he is walking right now.
    <br>For how many years have you been suffering from this problem?
    <br>For three years.
    <br>- For three years you were having this problem?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Tell us, how did this problem affect you socially - with family and friends.
    <br>From the clip we could see the flies swarming around it
    <br>and we know the kind of stench that would be coming from such a leg.
    <br>It affected me in the sense that all my friends ran away
    <br>and some would tell me that the only solution was to pack my things to the village
    <br>because they did not have money to transport a corpse from Benue State to Cross River State.
    <br>They counted me as a dead person.
    <br>When I looked at myself, I saw I had become useless because I could not do anything.
    <br>If you had smelt it, you would still be able to smell it even a kilometre away.
    <br>Nobody could eat with me.
    <br>If you had anything here and saw my leg, you would reject that thing.
    <br>Some would tell me that because of my leg, they had stopped eating meat.
    <br>I am very happy that when I came here, God used the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, to put an end to all these problems.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Tell us what happened after the man of God prayed for you and you found out that you could begin to walk.
    <br>After the man of God prayed for me, I stood up and felt very light.
    <br>I did not feel any pain any more and started walking.
    <br>That is how all of the water and blood stopped coming out immediately.
    <br>The motorcycle man who came to pick me up shouted and asked if I was really the one
    <br>and that he never believed what people were saying about this place.
    <br>He said it was only me that he had seen as an example and had believed
    <br>and that before, he thought they were acting drama.
    <br>I said, 'Thank God, you have seen it for yourself.'
    <br>He said that it was through me he knew what was happening was real.
    <br>Can we see the leg that would have been cut off?
    <br>To the glory of God, viewers all over the world, you can see the leg and you can see the man tapping it.
    <br>- Are you experiencing any pain?
    <br>- I am not feeling any pain.
    <br>Jacob Apachi
    <br>Healed Of Leg Ulcer Due To Diabetes
    <br>- You mean, you don't feel any pain?
    <br>- I don't feel any pain.
    <br>Amen. Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Jacob Apachi
    <br>Healed Of Leg Ulcer Due To Diabetes
    <br>We can see that your wife and children are now so happy for what the Lord has done.
    <br>My name is Magdalene Apachi.
    <br>We have come from Cross River State, but we are residing in Benue State.
    <br>When this problem started, I was surprised because in my life, I had never seen such a thing like this.
    <br>I advised him that we should try the hospital.
    <br>When we went, the doctor said they had to amputate the leg.
    <br>When we came back home, I said we should try a witch doctor.
    <br>We tried witch doctors but they could not do it.
    <br>Then I told him we would find a solution at The SCOAN.
    <br>When we got here, we were placed on the prayer line where the man of God prayed for my husband.
    <br>I was surprised to see that immediately when he said, 'Be healed, in the mighty name of Jesus',
    <br>my husband stood up
    <br>and I said this is someone we had been carrying here and there and now he could walk by himself.
    <br>The blood and water that kept gushing out, because of the vein that had been cut, all stopped immediately.
    <br>Within two days, I could not smell the odour any more.
    <br>Previously, at home, friends could not visit us and sometimes,
    <br>I would be ashamed and tell them that my husband was not around.
    <br>I was surprised to see that the leg became dry.
    <br>I said, "I know God has been doing it for others; He would do it for me."
    <br>So, that was how the healing started.
    <br>They even advised me to bring my husband to the village,
    <br>that if he died, what would I do?
    <br>I told them that my husband would not die, in Jesus' name because I believed in the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I was watching Emmanuel TV and I knew God has been doing it for others and He would do the same for me.
    <br>I put my faith in God, we brought my husband here and it happened.
    <br>So, I thank God for everything that happened in my life and that of my husband.
    <br>There is God in The SCOAN.
    <br>That God who gives Prophet T.B. Joshua the heart to care for people, I thank Him so much.
    <br>Anybody who is here should have faith and look at my husband's case.
    <br>They should believe that God is going to heal them, one by one.
    <br>Thank you very much. Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>My name is Lucy. These are my mum, dad, brothers and sisters.
    <br>The problem that brought us to The SCOAN was a leg ulcer due to diabetes.
    <br>I was not happy because when people saw my father, they would run away from him.
    <br>So, I was not happy.
    <br>You can hear from the little girl.
    <br>She is explaining that when the father had this problem of leg ulcer due to diabetes,
    <br>people would run away from him and even family and friends deserted him.
    <br>I was not able to go to school because my father could not pay our school fees.
    <br>You have heard - this is the way she can express herself.
    <br>She said that because of this problem she and her siblings were no longer going to school
    <br>because the father could no longer fend for the family.
    <br>But right now, God has healed him through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>What can you say? How do you feel right now?
    <br>I feel so happy.
    <br>And what is your advice to people who are watching you?
    <br>My advice is that they should have faith in God.
    <br>Jacob Apachi
    <br>Healed Of Leg Ulcer Due To Diabetes
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Sir, can you tell your advice to people who are watching you, who are looking at you right now
    <br>and they are also having the same problem you once found yourself in three years ago?
    <br>Give your advice to them.
    <br>My advice to viewers all over the world is that they should not lose hope.
    <br>If God can do it for a person like me, there is nobody God cannot do it for.
    <br>I am saying this because I know what I passed through.
    <br>I thank God that He is still caring for us.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remember that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, says that he is not the healer.
    <br>He knows the Healer and the Healer is Jesus Christ.
    <br>So if you have any problem, you have to look to the Cross where the price was paid for the healing that you seek.
    <br>We want you to take a walk around in the midst of the people and show them what the Lord has done in your life.
    <br>Remember, this man you are seeing right now on the screen with the leg that is healed
    <br>was suffering from the problem of leg ulcer due to diabetes,
    <br>and this is the leg that was medically confirmed to be amputated.
    <br>But to the glory of God, he came here and he was set free.
    <br>Jacob Apachi
    <br>Healed Of Leg Ulcer Due To Diabetes
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Yes, we know that your joy knows no bounds for what the Lord has done in your life,
    <br>because as the Bible says, 'You shall not die but you shall live to declare the glory of God'.
    <br>And this is the glory of God, and we pray that this glory will not suffer corruption, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Therefore sir, we want to advise you that you have decided to make life's biggest decision,
    <br>which is to accept Christ through His Word.
    <br>But right now, we advise you to make life's second biggest decision, which is to follow His leading daily.
    <br>Make His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Remember, you have been healed, made whole and established through the Word,
    <br>therefore, walk in the light of that Word,
    <br>and God will continue to point you to that future you desire, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
