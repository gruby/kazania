    <br>PRAYER FOR VIEWERS
    <br>Viewers, anywhere you are right now, pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Use your faith to put a demand on the anointing.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier!
    <br>Whatever challenge you may be facing, touch your screen and receive, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Let us pray for the viewers.
    <br>This is the period of resurrection.
    <br>We know we are guilty of many things.
    <br>We believe Jesus died on the Cross for us.
    <br>This is a special grace.
    <br>He died on the Cross for us.
    <br>Every soul that cries, that demands for justice - He died on the Cross.
    <br>Victory! Victory! Hallelujah!
    <br>You that are crying - cry no more!
    <br>Whatever situation you are facing - here is justice!
    <br>Are you sick? Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be set free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Jesus! You died on the Cross for us and gave us victory!
    <br>Receive deliverance!
    <br>Receive your healing!
    <br>Whatever affliction in your bones, blood, tendons, wherever in your body -
    <br>receive your healing, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive your deliverance, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every reproach - be free!
    <br>Every injustice - be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Jesus knows your challenges.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
