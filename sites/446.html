    <br>Be Released to Flourish! TB Joshua Prayer
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever situation you are in, right now, it is time.
    <br>Where there is demand, there is supply.
    <br>There is enough anointing to give, to heal, and to deliver you.
    <br>Wherever you are, all over the world, you are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, that cancer, be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That affliction, be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever cage you are in: infirmity, generational curses, demons of all kinds.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, be delivered! In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your are free.
    <br>You are restored.
    <br>I am not saying, "Be restored," I am saying, "you are restored."
    <br>Right now, confess your restoration.
    <br>You are free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank you Lord.
    <br>Hey! Come out!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you can see the anointing of God.
    <br>People are putting their demand on the anointing.
    <br>Where there is a demand, there is a supply.
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be rescued, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are rescued, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Viewers, I can see you being rescued.
    <br>I can see you being delivered.
    <br>I can see you being rescued.
    <br>I can see you being released.
    <br>Your business is released
    <br>Your career is released.
    <br>Your health is released.
    <br>You are released to good health.
    <br>Your business is released to breakthrough.
    <br>Your finances are released to breakthrough.
    <br>Your career is released to flourish.
    <br>Be flourished!
