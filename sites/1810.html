    <br>In the name of Jesus, we present the nations, the world at large to You, Lord.
    <br>Forgive them their iniquities. Forgive them their wrongs.
    <br>Forgive them their sins, Lord Jesus. There is cure in the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>There is mighty cure; there is mighty healing.
    <br>Heal our land!
    <br>Heal the world!
    <br>Heal them of fear of COVID-19!
    <br>You are the great help, the very help in times of trouble.
    <br>Here is the time.
    <br>Help and rescue the world at large, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Lord Jesus, by the authority of the Scripture, help the world at large,
    <br>help the nations at large!
    <br>Cure them of fear, Lord Jesus!
    <br>Cure the world over fear of this, fear of that!
    <br>COVID-19, this is your end!
    <br>Lord Jesus, You have done it before; do it again, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>All the way to Calvary
    <br>He went for us
    <br>He went to save our souls
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen.

    <br>ANOINTED PRAYER WITH TB JOSHUA AT PRAYER MOUNTAIN
    <br>We have a Friend
    <br>Who never fails
    <br>Who never fails
    <br>Forevermore
    <br>Amen
    <br>Jesus never fails

    <br>Father, we want to commit our ministers of the Gospel.
    <br>We are struggling to be like You.
    <br>There is a mix-up.
    <br>We are struggling to be like You.
    <br>That is the reason we have division in the House of God.
    <br>That is why there is division everywhere in Your House.
    <br>That is why there is division all over the world.
    <br>Father, strengthen us, refill us, remould us,
    <br>rearrange us, and fill us with fresh anointing.
    <br>Without anointing, no one can do Your work.
    <br>Without anointing, our challenges will overwhelm us.
    <br>Without anointing, our challenges will overpower us.
    <br>We ask for fresh anointing. Fill every minister of the Gospel.
    <br>Fill them, Lord!
    <br>Remould them, Lord!
    <br>Refill them, Lord!
    <br>Remould them, Lord!
    <br>Rearrange them, Lord!
    <br>Fill them for the journey!
    <br>Rearrange them for the journey, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>For those who are on the sickbed, Father, I declare them free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive your deliverance, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Receive your healing, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever sickness in your body, fluids, organs, whatever name they call it, COVID-19,
    <br>whatever affliction - receive your deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive your cure, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive your healing, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Never a sickness, never a disease Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot heal. Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Receive your freedom, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your business, finances, marriage - it is well!
    <br>It is well
    <br>In the name of Jesus
    <br>It is well
    <br>In your business today
    <br>In your finances, career, marriage, family - be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself -
    <br>chain of affliction, chain of hardship, chain of poverty -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see chains broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see chains of affliction broken!
    <br>I can see chains of hardship broken!
    <br>I can see chains of COVID-19 broken, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see chains of career failure, I can see chains of financial failure,
    <br>I can see chains of curses - generational curses -
    <br>I can see chains broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Amen.

    <br>Let me ask for a fresh anointing.
    <br>Father, a fresh anointing to all the ministers of the Gospel, all over the world!
    <br>Lord, remould us, refill us with Your mighty fresh anointing - anointing that breaks the yoke!

    <br>Remould us Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Refill us Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!

    <br>Amen!
    <br>ANOINTED PRAYER WITH TB JOSHUA AT PRAYER MOUNTAIN
    <br>The Scripture says, "Come unto Me all ye that labour; I will give them rest."
    <br>Lord, here are Your children; here are Your people. They ask for rest.
    <br>Give them rest, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Refill them, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remould them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let the weak say, "I am strong!"
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let the sick say, "I am healed!"
    <br>Those who are sick - whatever sickness, whatever affliction -
    <br>be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I command you to be delivered, to be set free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ! In the Blood of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever the sickness in your blood, fluids, tendons, tissues,
    <br>wherever it is in your organs, system, faculties - be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That sickness in your kidneys, liver, bones, blood -
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you, sickness - leave, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ we pray!
    <br>It is well.
    <br>It is well in the name of Jesus.
    <br>It is well in our soul today.
    <br>In your soul, spirit, body, flesh - I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I declare you free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Those on the sickbed, wherever you are -
    <br>I pray the medical doctors, medical professionals, caregivers, our nurses -
    <br>let them sense the presence of God!
    <br>Sense the presence of God!
    <br>Sense the presence of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Use them, Lord - the medical doctors.
    <br>Use them, Lord - the caregivers.
    <br>Use them, Lord - our nursing sisters and nursing brothers.
    <br>Use them, Lord, to restore the health of sick ones, to restore their health, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Being a nurse does not mean you cannot be sick.
    <br>That you are caring for the sick ones - you caregivers, professional doctors, nurses -
    <br>does not mean you cannot be sick. You can be sick.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed in your blood!
    <br>Be healed in your soul!
    <br>Be healed in your spirit!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever sickness, disease you are facing right now, I cover you with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>I cover you with the Blood of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Surgeons' hands - I place my hand on them.
    <br>Lord Jesus, guide the surgeons' hands.
    <br>The treatment given to the sick ones - Lord Jesus, guide them!
    <br>Whatever treatment given to the sick ones - Lord, guide them!
    <br>Guide them to breakthrough! Guide them to restoration!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>ANOINTED PRAYER WITH TB JOSHUA AT PRAYER MOUNTAIN
    <br>Glory be to God! I have been on this mountain for the past four days
    <br>and I am going to leave today.
    <br>This is where I stay; this is where I sleep
    <br>to know the mind of God and to know what is going on
    <br>concerning the situation right now in the world.
    <br>I will be leaving today.
