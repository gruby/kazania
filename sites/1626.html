    <br>TB Joshua OPENS SCHOOL In Ecuador üá™üá®| Follow Up Visit!!!
    <br>In the depths of the Mache Chindul Ecological Reserve in the rural state of Esmeraldas, Ecuador,
    <br>accessible only by canoe along the Rio Sucio, or by foot or by horse along the forest track,
    <br>lies the village of San Salvador, home to a rural indigenous people, the Chachi tribe,
    <br>who as well as speaking Spanish have their own language.

    <br>Aftermath Of 2016 Earthquake In Ecuador
    <br>When the devastating earthquake of 2016 severely damaged their school,
    <br>which was the main high school for the local communities, it seemed that all hope was lost.
    <br>After all, news filtered in from outside that over 200 schools had been damaged.
    <br>How was their school, so valuable to the community and yet so remote, to be noticed?
    <br>Aftermath Of 2016 Earthquake In Ecuador
    <br>But God Almighty, who hears the prayers of the weak and downtrodden, had a plan.
    <br>Speaking in Spanish at a school thanksgiving event, one of the teachers takes up the story.
    <br>This group, Emmanuel TV, came to Ecuador, to the capital, Quito,
    <br>then they moved on to the Province of Esmeraldas.
    <br>and later they arrived in Muisne, with a view to helping the earthquake victims.
    <br>Two days earlier, with Mr. Santiago, we had made a strong representation
    <br>to the Governor of Esmeraldas Province, Paola Cabezas.
    <br>As part of our complaint, we announced to the national authorities that no one had done anything
    <br>for the Chachi people of San Salvador.
    <br>Two days later, this group (Emmanuel TV) came to help our earthquake victims.
    <br>It was following this intervention with the Governor, that they came specifically to help the Chachis.
    <br>It was winter and they came to San Salvador in a canoe with the local sheriff.
    <br>This visit was to bring some cheer to us.
    <br>When they came, they were able to send back photos of the classrooms in terrible condition.
    <br>At the time of the reconstruction, there were not four nor seven classrooms
    <br>but friends, there were 20 new classrooms.
    <br>Look at the level of help we have received here in San Salvador!
    <br>For this, let us give a strong applause for the Emmanuel TV Team's presence in San Salvador.
    <br>The new school provided freely by T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>had not only replaced the damaged infrastructure of the previous school;
    <br>every member of the community felt the effect of its force for good.
    <br>The miles of narrow grassy track accessible only by foot were widened,
    <br>and construction of bridges over the gullies and streams
    <br>meant that vehicles could now pass when the weather was dry enough.
    <br>The Newly Built Classrooms Of The School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>A new life was opening up and as the students saw the brand new classrooms with glossy tiled floors,
    <br>they gazed in awe as if to say ‚ÄúIs all this for us?‚Äù
    <br>Children Of The Juan Lorenzo A√±apa School In San Salvador De Los Chachis, Ecuador
    <br>May 18th, 2017 was a red letter day for the Chachi community.
    <br>All the school gathered to welcome Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>who had made the long journey of nearly 10,000 km over the Atlantic ocean.
    <br>As he neared the village, the rain pours down and the cars stick in the mud on the newly widened track,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua set out to walk and to experience for himself
    <br>the challenges many children faced in getting to the school.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua's Journey On Foot To The Newly Built School In Ecudaor
    <br>During the joyful day of celebration, T.B. Joshua was given the traditional Chachi shirt
    <br>and proclaimed his love for the community and promised continued support for the school.
    <br>Someone somewhere is in need of what you possess.
    <br>Jesus is saying to us, ‚ÄúI have no farm where I expect you to work for me
    <br>or an office where I expect you to help me in checking files.
    <br>My farm and office are your fellow brothers.
    <br>Whatever help you render to the least of them, whatever problem you help someone else to solve,
    <br>that you render unto Me.‚Äù
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Greets The Students In Their Classrooms
    <br>As time passed, it became clear that the school would benefit greatly from a modern computer laboratory,
    <br>so that the students could be well prepared, whether they aspired to further education
    <br>or in managing their agricultural work in the local community.
    <br>Children Of The Juan Lorenzo A√±apa School In San Salvador De Los Chachis, Ecuador
    <br>T.B. Joshua, when informed of this need, immediately sent a team
    <br>to investigate sourcing the best type of computer suite for the school.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team co-ordinated with the local government authorities
    <br>from the Department of Education.
    <br>Good morning. My name is Marcela Alexandra Monta√±o Salas,
    <br>District Director of Education for the Muisne Canton.
    <br>We thank you for all the help that Emmanuel TV has brought to us,
    <br>for the help to the younger and older students of the school in San Salvador del los Chachis
    <br>and for the Computer Laboratory that you are going to build at the school
    <br>with the latest computers and IT equipment.
    <br>This will be really beneficial for the students.
    <br>A thousand thanks from here in Esmeraldas Province, Ecuador!
    <br>The team then selected the best local companies to build the 25-desk Computer Lab
    <br>and instal everything in the warm and humid conditions of the tropical rain forest.
    <br>Using one of the new classrooms, finally, the installation work begins.
    <br>First a new ceiling is built to improve the working environment,
    <br>and professional-standard lighting is installed.
    <br>Transporting The Handmade Furniture For The Computer Laboratory Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>The special computer desks and chairs are made locally
    <br>and then transported along the much improved track to the school.
    <br>Here, some of the teachers and parents are waiting to help unload.
    <br>Unloading The Handmade Furniture For The Computer Laboratory Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>The furniture begins to be arranged in the already transformed room.
    <br>Positioning The Handmade Furniture For The Computer Laboratory Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>The excitement and expectation starts to build.
    <br>Soon, the precious cargo of the computer terminals is transported carefully by 4x4 vehicles to San Salvador,
    <br>where the community eagerly receives them and helps carry them into the designated rooms.
    <br>Unloading The IT Equipment For The Computer Laboratory Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Some children watch on, as the engineers start the process of installation.
    <br>Installing The IT Equipment For The Computer Laboratory Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>As the teachers help clear away the boxes,
    <br>the printer is tested by printing a special message of thanks to Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Testing The Screen And Projector In The New Computer Laboratory Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>The projection screen and projector are tested next,
    <br>before some students arrive to get a peak preview of the new laboratory,
    <br>and to practice the careful positioning of the dust covers.
    <br>Now that everything has been tested, it is time to begin the first computer training session for the teachers.
    <br>What a contrast from the early visits in 2016,
    <br>where the remaining walls of the school were so flimsy that a child could push them down.
    <br>Today, thanks to TB Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>there is a purpose built school with ample classrooms admitting children from pre-kindergarten
    <br>right up to the 18 and 19 year old who attend, eagerly appreciating their last chances of free learning.
    <br>Here in the new Computer Lab, the teachers are amazed; can this really be happening in San Salvador?
    <br>One of them speaks on behalf of them all.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, good morning!
    <br>This is the Intercultural Bilingual Educational Unit "Juan Lorenzo A√±apa".
    <br>The teaching staff, the students and the entire community
    <br>are totally satisfied, content, happy, joyful and excited
    <br>with the unconditional cooperation which your Foundation (Emmanuel TV), under your direction,
    <br>is operating in our community - a village so far from your country.
    <br>Our sincere thanks and congratulations to you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The school had been asking for some international teaching support,
    <br>and T.B. Joshua responded by sending three professional teachers from the UK.
    <br>Here they arrive in Esmeraldas City, ready to teach the first lesson in the new computer laboratory,
    <br>and to present some special lessons in English, Music and Geography.
    <br>International Professional Teachers Sent By Emmanuel TV Arrive In Esmeraldas, Ecuador
    <br>On the first day of the visit, the community gathers for a thanksgiving and special celebration
    <br>of all the contributions made by Emmanuel TV to the school and community.
    <br>The local Governor officially notes the opening of the Computer Suite
    <br>and welcomes the Emmanuel TV Team including the International teachers,
    <br>noting as the rain gently falls that although T.B. Joshua is not physically present, he is with them in spirit.
    <br>On this morning, I feel very happy and proud to again share in the presence
    <br>of the members of the Emmanuel TV Team and, as Comrade Martin mentioned,
    <br>the personal presence in spirit of our friend, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>His strength and energy influence us even from over there where he is.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team then formally presents the computer laboratory on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV Partners, and offers a word of encouragement.
    <br>Today, we have the honour to present formally to you the fully equipped Computer Centre.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Formally Presents The New Computer Laboratory
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has taught us from the Bible that although we may not be equally gifted,
    <br>every person has a strength to contribute.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Formally Presents The New Computer Laboratory
    <br>Whatever area we are strong in, we are expected to use it generously to strengthen our fellow brother.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Formally Presents The New Computer Laboratory
    <br>We have also learned from T.B. Joshua how important education is.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Formally Presents The New Computer Laboratory
    <br>Education is not success, but it is to help us succeed.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Formally Presents The New Computer Laboratory
    <br>T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners from around the world have had the privilege
    <br>to contribute to the education of this community, San Salvador de los Chachis.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Formally Presents The New Computer Laboratory
    <br>The proceedings continue with some local music, followed by the singing of the Ecuador National Anthem.

    <br>The visiting teachers then explain about some of the resources they will be using.
    <br>We would like to teach the children some of these words: yellow, brown, red, blue.
    <br>This is followed by a happy demonstration of the Parachute,
    <br>with active games to teach colours in English, enjoyed greatly by the participants.

    <br>No celebration is complete without some good food.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team provides chicken and rice for everyone and five large luscious celebration cakes.
    <br>The community and helpers cook and serve the delicious meal
    <br>supplemented by local plantain and freshly squeezed juice.

    <br>All the community who are able to leave other duties are also included in the celebration meal.

    <br>With the celebration finished and the playground now cleared,
    <br>the children now start to gather for the special lessons
    <br>to be given by the Emmanuel TV Team's  international professional teachers.
    <br>A highlight is that the computer lessons will be given in the brand new computer lab donated by Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The first class excitedly files into the computer lab, where they will be taught by Olivia Higgins
    <br>who as well as gaining her teaching qualification at the world renowned University of Cambridge,
    <br>also has a degree in Spanish.
    <br>Computer Lessons With An International Professional Teacher Sent By Emmanuel TV
    <br>As well as the computer classes for the school students,
    <br>there are also by special arrangement extra lessons for some older members of the community.
    <br>These are extremely popular, with lines for the classes eagerly forming outside.

    <br>Olivia takes time out with some of the smaller children,
    <br>and then reflects on her experience of being part of the Emmanuel TV Team for this special visit.
    <br>Hello, my name is Olivia Higgins. I am from London and I am a teacher.
    <br>I went to the University of Bath to study Languages and my speciality is Spanish,
    <br>and then I went to the University of Cambridge to do my teacher training.
    <br>I was invited on this project by Emmanuel TV and I have had an amazing time.
    <br>It has been such an experience to come to such a remote place and to have the opportunity
    <br>to teach such beautiful people.
    <br>I have been responsible for the computing and for teaching all the computer skills this week.
    <br>That has been wonderful because there have been adults, youth and children.
    <br>I've really enjoyed seeing how grateful they are for those skills they haven't had before.
    <br>Geography is taught by Peter Churchill, a former high school geography teacher,
    <br>with support from Itzia, who helps translate into Spanish.
    <br>Geography Lessons With An International Professional Teacher Sent By Emmanuel TV
    <br>The lessons are brought alive by the addition of inflatable globes,
    <br>enough for the pupils to divide into different study groups.
    <br>Here, one group proudly identifies their home country of Ecuador,
    <br>while another scours the continent of Africa
    <br>before finally locating Ecuador on the Pacific coast of South America.

    <br>And here the groups identify which animals come from which countries.
    <br>Geography Lessons With An International Professional Teacher Sent By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Specially prepared worksheets in Spanish also help the children learn the directions of the compass
    <br>and the details of the weather cycle.
    <br>Geography Lessons With An International Professional Teacher Sent By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Let us now listen to the experience of Mr Churchiill, and then Itzia
    <br>Hello, my name is Peter Churchill.
    <br>Emmanuel! It is wonderful to be here in Ecuador to teach these wonderful children.
    <br>I used to be a Geography teacher, so it was interesting to introduce them to what,
    <br>I think, for many of them was a new subject.
    <br>It was really good to have these blow-up globes and they found that very interesting
    <br>and they really enjoyed working in groups.
    <br>But the thing that really struck me was how respectful and well behaved the children were.
    <br>That was a real joy, as a teacher, to teach such lovely children.
    <br>Emmanuel! My name is Itzia Montejano and I am from Mexico City.
    <br>I really enjoyed this trip, being a helper and teacher. 
    <br>The children are really special.
    <br>They enjoyed learning some English and Geography, which were new things for them.
    <br>I am very grateful to God to be here and to be part of this.
    <br>A class now arrives for a special English lesson, taken by Wendy Churchill,
    <br>where the children learn some English conversation skills.
    <br>English Lessons With An International Professional Teacher Sent By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Next, a well-known children's song teaches the English names for some parts of the body.
    <br>English Lessons With An International Professional Teacher Sent By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Worksheets are also very useful to reinforce what the children have learned.
    <br>English Lessons With An International Professional Teacher Sent By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Another lesson focuses on the English names for colours,
    <br>again combining the use of specially prepared worksheets with well-known children's songs.
    <br>English Lessons With An International Professional Teacher Sent By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Mrs Churchill teaches the children a specially written song in Spanish and English.

    <br>The local teacher also helps translate the chorus into Cha'palaa.
    <br>Students Sing The Chorus Of The Special Song In The Local Language Of Cha'palaa
    <br>Mrs Churchill now shares her experience of the week.
    <br>Good morning, my name is Wendy Churchill, I am a teacher in London, England.
    <br>I have enjoyed very much this wonderful opportunity to come to Ecuador.
    <br>For me, the most exciting thing has been interacting with the children and the teachers,
    <br>making myself understood with actions and different things I used - visual images and songs.
    <br>It has been such a wonderful opportunity for both of us to be able to give people those simple things
    <br>that we have to give that are part of our ordinary lives.
    <br>We don't even know that they are a treasure until we come here and are able to pass them on
    <br>to people who think it is absolutely amazing!
    <br>We thank God and we thank you, T.B. Joshua, and all the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>for all your support and love.
    <br>Next is a training session for the local teachers.
    <br>School teaching methods differ all over the world and there are many different styles.
    <br>The local teachers are taken through a special booklet on interactive learning
    <br>and given a demonstration of how to use some of the educational resources, purchased in the UK.
    <br>Training For Local Teachers With The International Professional Teachers Sent By Emmanuel TV
    <br>It is also an opportunity to thank them and give a gift
    <br>including a special Emmanuel TV bag well supplied with personal items.
    <br>Local Teachers Receive Gifts Given On Behalf of T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>Emmanuel TV Gift Bags Specially Prepared For The Students And Teachers
    <br>The Emmanuel TV bags have also been prepared for each of the schoolchildren,
    <br>together with snack bags with wholesome bread, a drink and a sweet treat.
    <br>The hygiene bags are made of strong reinforced cotton with a tough plastic lining and are filled with shampoo,
    <br>soap, wash cloth, toothpaste, comb and an ecologically friendly toothbrush made from bamboo,
    <br>a special order from Germany.
    <br>The long line of children waiting patiently says it all
    <br>and the happy smiles of all who receive the Emmanuel TV gifts is heart warming and joyous.
    <br>Truly, it is more blessed to give than to receive.
    <br>Students Receive Gift And Snack Bags As A Gift From Emmanuel TV
    <br>As the children prepare to take their gifts home,
    <br>let us listen to some words of thanks from the community and from school students.
    <br>My name is Lola A√±apa Tapuyo.
    <br>I live here in San Salvador.
    <br>I am a mother, I have many grandchildren and you (the Emmanuel TV Team) are also my family.
    <br>You do not forget Ecuador and our communities.
    <br>We met T.B. Joshua in person once; he has a very big and open heart and we received many gifts.
    <br>We give thanks for you and for God our Eternal Father as well. Thank you for everything!
    <br>My name is Jenny Karina.
    <br>Good morning. Thank you for teaching us.
    <br>My name is Jonny Proa√±o.
    <br>Thank you T.B. Joshua for the teaching.

    <br>I am very happy. Thank you for everything.
    <br>Hello and good morning. My name is Karelis Chasin.
    <br>I am a third year Baccalaureate Student and I am 18 years old.
    <br>Thank you to Emmanuel TV and to Prophet T.B. Joshua for providing for us this Computer Centre
    <br>so that we can learn much more than we have learned before
    <br>about all the theories and everything to do with computers.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>My name is Modesto de la Cruz Pianchiche.
    <br>We thank T.B. Joshua and the Foundation (Emmanuel TV) that has come to help
    <br>the Chachi Community of San Salvador.
    <br>Thank you from all of us for all the work you have been doing for us!
    <br>As a memorable finale for the Emmanuel TV sponsored visit of the international teachers
    <br>to San Salvador de los Chachis, an educational outing for the older students was planned.
    <br>Close to the world heritage city of Quito high in the Andes mountains
    <br>and exactly on the line of the Equator, is 'Mitad del Mundo' - the Centre of the World.
    <br>Here a world famous museum and visitors' attraction has been built, and visitors from all over the world
    <br>regularly take photos with one foot in the northern hemisphere and the other in the southern hemisphere.
    <br>It was to be a long coach ride of around 7 hours, not to mention the time taken to reach the main road
    <br>from the students various homes inside the rainforest.
    <br>Most of the students had never been so far from the forest before.
    <br>As the 31 students relax in the comfortable coach with their teachers,
    <br>they pass many small villages and see many youth their age, just waiting around.
    <br>For the Chachi students, this is a unique day, a special day,
    <br>an all-expenses-paid chance to visit a world-class attraction in their own country of Ecuador.
    <br>The bus, leaving the flatter tropical plains begins the winding journey up the mountain roads
    <br>towards the famous capital, with the fleeting clouds sometimes covering the hills.

    <br>Students Stop Enroute For Lunch Provided By Emmanuel TV
    <br>A stop to eat - throughout the entire visit of the teachers,
    <br>food had been provided by the Emmanuel TV Team,
    <br>and now was a planned stop for a nourishing full meal of steaming hot soup,
    <br>followed by chicken or beef and rice, supplemented by a delicious home-pressed fruit juice.
    <br>The students' excitement erupts as they declare in chorus that they are on the way to Mitad del Mudo!
    <br>We are on our way to Mitad del Mundo!
    <br>Students Stop Enroute For Lunch Provided By Emmanuel TV
    <br>After the meal, the travellers rejoin the coach for the last stage of the journey,
    <br>with a perilous rockfall on one side of the road and a yawning crevasse on the other side.
    <br>Confidently, the professional coach driver navigates the obstacle.
    <br>School Trip By Coach To Mitad Del Mundo, Quito, Provided By Emmanuel TV
    <br>The weather clears as the outskirts of Quito come into view
    <br>and finally the coach approaches Mitad del Mundo and arrives at its destination.
    <br>The mountain weather in Quito is quite different from the tropical rainforest
    <br>and the students are given permission for semi-relaxed uniform.
    <br>Glossy brushed hair for the girls and sharp barbering styles sported by the older boys are much in evidence.
    <br>The visiting group enters the Mitad del Mundo site through a VIP private gate.
    <br>Students Enter The Site Of Mitad Del Mundo, Quito, On The School Trip Provided By Emmanuel TV
    <br>First stop has to be the famous ‚ÄúEquator line‚Äù
    <br>and the long line of students poses for the first of many pictures,
    <br>with one foot in the north of the world and one foot in the south.
    <br>It may be only 7 hours drive away but it is a different world.
    <br>After listening to an official welcome, the students enter a lift to ascend to the viewpoint.

    <br>Here they gaze interestedly at the panorama of hills, desert and architecture that spreads out below.
    <br>What is important is to capture this delightful outing using a phone camera.

    <br>Next stop is the museum, describing the history, geography and rich cultural heritage of Ecuador.

    <br>The students particularly appreciate also the special interactive scientific section of the museum,
    <br>designed around the theme of the earth's Equator.

    <br>Next is a visit to the Planetarium.
    <br>Inside this exhibit, the students are taught about the wonders of the night sky,
    <br>before entering a special darkened simulation area where they study the stars
    <br>with the help of high-tech virtual reality headsets.

    <br>Back to earth, how quickly the time has raced by!
    <br>Before leaving, a special gift of local sugar-free chocolate
    <br>is presented to all the students by the Emmanuel TV Team.
    <br>The Students Receive Chocolate Souvenirs From Mitad Del Mundo
    <br>Finally, there are photos beneath a signpost showing distances to other world cities
    <br>and sitting on the steps of the large Mitad del Mundo sign.
    <br>The students then make their way back to the coach,
    <br>as the shadows start to lengthen and a day to remember draws to a close.
    <br>What an outing!
    <br>We are very happy here at Mitad del Mundo (Centre of the World),
    <br>the students of the Juan Lorenzo A√±apa School from Esmeraldas, Muisne, Ecuador!
    <br>Thank you to T.B. Joshua!
    <br>I feel happy for travelling here to Mitad del Mundo.
    <br>Thank you T.B. Joshua!
    <br>My name is Jimena Wendy Tapuyo.
    <br>I am very happy here in Quito, in Mitad del Mundo.
    <br>Many thanks, T.B. Joshua!
    <br>My name is Venus.
    <br>I am happy on this trip here in Quito, in Mitad del Mundo. Many thanks.
    <br>As for now we leave the Chachi community of San Salvador,
    <br>the school has 285 children registered, with more coming.
    <br>The classrooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.
    <br>The new computer lab with its preloaded wealth of educational information offers all the community
    <br>from the small ones to the information-hungry adults the chance to discover and learn.
    <br>The road that was once a single-file grassy track over streams is now in regular use by sturdy vehicles
