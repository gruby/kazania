  <p>    
    <br>My name is Geoffrey Okwengu.
    <br>I came all the way from Kenya.
    <br>The first time I came,
    <br>the problem that brought me here was HIV 1 and 2.
    <br>For how many years were you having this problem of HIV?
    <br>I had suffered for two years.
    <br>I discovered I was HIV positive when I was about to get married.
    <br>That is how the plans for marriage disappeared.
    <br>I was always getting sick.
    <br>That was why I decided to come to The SCOAN to be prayed for so that I would be healed.
    <br>Before you came, when you discovered that you were positive to HIV,
    <br>how did you feel?
    <br>I felt very sad and bad because I knew the enemy had me.
    <br>I was destined for the grave at a very early age.
    <br>I tested positive at Nairobi Hospital.
    <br>So I came here and the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>I was given the Morning Water and I went home.
    <br>I kept administering it.
    <br>After a while, I had a dream.
    <br>I had an encounter with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, in a dream
    <br>where he appeared to me.
    <br>It was in a theatre; he was operating on me.
    <br>After he had finished, he told me, "You are healed".
    <br>In the dream I said, "Thank You, Jesus. I'm healed".
    <br>Then I woke up from the dream.
    <br>Immediately after that, I found out that I was now getting better.
    <br>I was feeling okay; I was feeling good.
    <br>Then I went for a test.
    <br>I then discovered that I was HIV negative.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>This is somebody who was given a certificate of death,
    <br>meaning someone who was tested HIV 1 and 2.
    <br>The man of God prayed for him in the midst of the crowd.
    <br>Can you tell us the name of the hospital that tested you right now negative.
    <br>It was Nairobi Hospital.
    <br>The same hospital?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That once tested you positive?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you went back and now you are negative?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Wow. Can you tell us - what happened after the man of God prayed for you?
    <br>I am totally free.
    <br>I was able to get married.
    <br>My marriage got delayed. Even my younger siblings - I'm the first born - got married before me.
    <br>I now got married; I had a very big wedding in 2013.
    <br>Now I have two boys.
    <br>Mr Geoffrey Okwengu
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Brother, what were the symptoms you were having,
    <br>apart from the medical report we are seeing right now?
    <br>What were the symptoms you were having then that you are no longer having right now?
    <br>I was having very high fever.
    <br>I was sweating when I was sleeping.
    <br>I was losing weight
    <br>I became very thin; thinner than I am right now.
    <br>All of those symptoms disappeared.
    <br>I am no longer having them; I am okay.
    <br>The advice I will give to those having a similar problem is
    <br>that there is no disease Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>In this place, the Lord is able to heal every kind of disease.
    <br>Make your way here and the Lord is going to touch you and heal you.
    <br>Amen. We believe with you and know that Jesus Christ healed
    <br>and He still heals all manner of sickness and disease.
    <br>If Jesus Christ in His infinite mercy can use His able servant Prophet T.B. Joshua to heal you
    <br>from this problem of HIV/Aids, we believe He can do it for anyone
    <br>who is also listening to you to the glory of God.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>This one on top are the results that showed that I was HIV positive.
    <br>They date back to 2010.
    <br>The first one here is the one that confirmed it.
    <br>This other one is a lab report, and this one was for confirmation that I was HIV positive.
    <br>This ones down here are very recent reports -
    <br>a lab report showing that I am HIV negative and a confirmation report showing the same.

    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>The picture down here:
    <br>this one is my wife,
    <br>this is me,
    <br>and our wonderful two children.
    <br>I named my first born Joshua
    <br>because of what the Lord did for me when I came here.
    <br>His name is Joshua.
    <br>The second born is Elijah.
    <br>He is 2 1/2 years old, and the other one - his birthday is on June 20th.
    <br>My children are all clean; they are all HIV negative and okay.
    <br>Hallelujah! Once again, let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>We thank God for your life. We rejoice with you.
    <br>We want to remind you that the reason why you were healed
    <br>is for you to serve Christ Jesus for the rest of your life.
    <br>Make His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>continue to be loyal to Him and train your children in the way of the Lord
    <br>so that when they grow up, they will not depart from it, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus!
