    247 - The SECRETS Of CONTENTMENT TB Joshua
  </h3>
  <p>
    Hallelujah!
    <br>Jesus has seen you through already.
    <br>That is the meaning of your coming here today.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>That a man is rich does not mean he is better than you in the presence of God.
    <br>One of the richest in the nation or in the world
    <br>does not mean that in the presence of God, he has a better position than you.
    <br>Because of those things, he becomes your mentor.
    <br>When it comes to spiritual issues,
    <br>we don't look at wealth, possessions or fame.
    <br>We don't use these to choose the person to be your mentor.
    <br>The only thing the Bible tells us about this:
    <br>such a person must be a communicator between visible and invisible.
    <br>When you see a communicator,
    <br>one of the qualities you see in them is contentment.
    <br>They believe they are what God says they are
    <br>and they have what God says they have.
    <br>CONTENTMENT
    <br>They don't look at others, they don't compare to others, they are always content.
    <br>Look at the word 'contentment'.
    <br>To be content is to be satisfied, no matter how little or small...
    <br>How many of us are content here?
    <br>That is the challenge the world at large has today.
    <br>That is the challenge you are having.
    <br>More...
    <br>And the Lord knows that no matter what He gives you, you will continue to ask for more and more...
    <br>Because you are not content - that has affected your peace.
    <br>The peace of heart is not there.
    <br>You cannot have peace; it is not possible when you are not content.
    <br>You continue to run and run until you discover whom you are, "Oh no. God's time is the best".
    <br>Only those who are content know God's time for their lives.
    <br>Look at what you are involved in.
    <br>Your income cannot even pay your house rent.
    <br>Your house rent is more than your income.
    <br>How do you pay your house rent?
    <br>The little you have now - if you can be content, it will grow.
    <br>The moment you are content, you are leaving the battle for God.
    <br>Whether the prayer is answered or not...
    <br>You ask for bread and there is no bread - the Lord will still remain your Provider, your God.
    <br>You will not run from one church to spiritualist or witch doctor
    <br>because you believe your prayer is not answered because you are not content.
    <br>It is a gift of God.
    <br>It is a thing of the heart; contentment comes from the heart.
    <br>The first place we are to prosper is in our spiritual life.
    <br>The challenges we are having now:
    <br>Your financial and emotional life are so much bigger than your spiritual life.
    <br>When your spiritual life is 3, every other area in your life is 20, 30, 40.
    <br>CONTENTMENT
    <br>When you are content, no more fear, murmuring or complaining.
    <br>The opinion of people about you does not matter but the opinion of God.
    <br>No one knows you better than yourself.
    <br>Let them say whatever they want to say about you.
    <br>The SECRETS Of CONTENTMENT | TB Joshua
    <br>When you are not content, you listen to what people say about you.
    <br>What people say about you dictates the direction.
    <br>Your situation dictates the direction of your prayer.
    <br>Then, when are you going to say, "Thank You, Jesus"?
    <br>In this world, you cannot be zero-free.
    <br>When you are content, you'll wait for God's time.
    <br>When you are content, God's time will be your roadmap.
    <br>When you want to move, you say, "God's time".
    <br>When it is not God's time, when everybody is moving, you will just wait.
    <br>And when you move at God's time, everything looks beautiful.
    <br>The SECRETS Of CONTENTMENT | TB Joshua
    <br>Where God guides, He protects.
    <br>Let us wait for God's time.
    <br>Look at our lives, even our marriages...
    <br>When you talk of marriage, there are two things we must take note of:
    <br>the right time and the right person.
    <br>It is the right time that brings about the right person,
    <br>not right person brings about the right time.
    <br>If those two are mistaken, there will be trouble in marriage.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The right time and the right person."
    <br>The right time brings about the right person.
