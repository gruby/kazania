  <p>    
    <br>It is the will of God for all of us to be set free from satanic bondage for the salvation of our souls.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua moves in the midst of the people ministering prayer,
    <br>the evil spirits tormenting them manifest violently
    <br>as they are cast out in the name above all names - Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let's watch as satan looses his grip on this man's life.
    <br>I made him kill himself.
    <br>I made him smoke.
    <br>I stole his money.
    <br>I stole his family.
    <br>He is addicted to drugs.
    <br>He is addicted to alcohol.
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>I'm going to make him kill himself.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am death.
    <br>How did you enter him?
    <br>I came in the air.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel, people of God!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Thoriso Maduna.
    <br>I am from Johannesburg, South Africa.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN in search of peace and deliverance,
    <br>to find and meet Jesus Christ and to see the face of God.
    <br>I started doing drugs when I was young.
    <br>Just before you tell us how the story began,
    <br>tell us what the things were that you were actually addicted to,
    <br>that brought you to The SCOAN.
    <br>Alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, women, pornography and a bad reputation.
    <br>I was addicted to hatred - just anything negative that any young man would experience in their life.
    <br>I was addicted to all negativity in a young man's life which only brings death.
    <br>Okay, tell us how it all started.
    <br>It started when I was 13 years old and it started through music.
    <br>The influence of the music that we were listening to at that time led us to...
    <br>When I say us, I mean I and my friends, but to make it more personal:
    <br>It led me to start drinking, smoking marijuana and cigarettes at a very young age.
    <br>It led us to become popular in our community as 'the bad boys'.
    <br>In order to maintain this popularity, one had to increase the rate of smoking and drinking -
    <br>to such a point where I would smoke 20-30 cigarettes a day, I would drink a bottle of rum daily.
    <br>It led us to using hard drugs - we moved on towards using cocaine and cardiamin.
    <br>I was addicted to the fast life of going to clubs from Thursday to Monday.
    <br>There was a club that I used to go to every day of the week without fail.
    <br>The amount of money it cost to maintain this life was honestly not manageable.
    <br>I lost my job, I lost my contracts, I lost everything in my life.
    <br>The only thing that I could say I had was my life.
    <br>I then started with criminal activities in order to maintain this lifestyle -
    <br>in order to maintain the alcohol, women and addiction to drugs.
    <br>Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We can understand exactly what our brother is talking about.
    <br>Right from the age of 13, you had these serious addictions.
    <br>Now we want you to be a little more specific, especially on this issue of drug addiction.
    <br>It is a problem that so many people around the world are facing especially young people.
    <br>Tell us - how did you start getting into this addiction to drugs
    <br>and what happened to your life once you began taking these drugs?
    <br>How serious was this addiction?
    <br>The impact is very painful
    <br>and I am sure that people with the same addiction worldwide will relate to it.
    <br>The impact that it had on my life is that I lost everything.
    <br>I lost my family, I lost myself, I lost God, I lost everything.
    <br>To such a point where these drugs take you over
    <br>and they make you believe that you don't have a problem.
    <br>They make you believe that you are the victim
    <br>when in actual fact, that is not the truth.
    <br>What they do is that they physically damage your brain
    <br>such that an individual cannot make any kind of advantageous decision for himself.
    <br>The impact now is that an individual - like what happened to me - starts to hate himself and the world.
    <br>You come to believe that the world hates you and everybody is against you.
    <br>You find yourself in a victim position.
    <br>The only result that comes from that is death
    <br>because if you don't kill yourself out of depression,
    <br>which comes as an effect of the drugs,
    <br>you intentionally put yourself in a situation
    <br>where you get killed either in a car accident because of intoxication,
    <br>in a fight where guns are being pulled out,
    <br>or through some other means or way.
    <br>What happened to me is that I found myself very close to death.
    <br>The Spirit of the living God throughout my trials at that time
    <br>has always been present, even when I was sinning.
    <br>There was a month I escaped three bad car accidents.
    <br>I was hijacked twice and
    <br>none of the bullets which were shot at me actually hit my body by the grace of God.
    <br>By the time I realised that I was very close to losing my life, I had given up.
    <br>The impact of the drugs on my mind was that I felt I needed protection
    <br>and I made arrangements to get a gun.
    <br>I got myself a gun but I couldn't find any bullets for the gun, by the grace of God.
    <br>I believed that I needed to protect myself, while in the actual fact the spirit was lying to me -
    <br>that gun was for me to kill myself.
    <br>So you are saying, brother, that under the influence of these drugs
    <br>you actually bought a gun and your intention was to take that gun and kill yourself?
    <br>That was the indirect intention.
    <br>The lie which came to me as a result of all these addictions was protection for myself.
    <br>But looking back today, I can confirm without a doubt
    <br>that the purchase of that gun was for suicide.
    <br>We can understand once again the severity of the addiction our brother is talking about.
    <br>Can you explain to us - was it something you were taking on a daily basis?
    <br>To maintain sanity, it had to be on a daily basis.
    <br>A bottle of rum, some drugs and two packets of cigarettes,
    <br>just so that one can stay sane and being normal on a daily basis.
    <br>You said, you began taking cocaine, which is a very hard drug.
    <br>What did that then graduate to after the cocaine? What drug did you then go to?
    <br>Because of the high cost of cocaine, I had to meddle down.
    <br>I then started with cardiamin, which is a cheaper version of cocaine.
    <br>That is one of the most vicious of the drugs which are out there and it is an international epidemic.
    <br>What it does is that it reconfigures your entire thought process mechanism,
    <br>in such a way that it blinds you completely.
    <br>Your brain cannot function under this drug whatsoever.
    <br>It changes your thoughts, it changes how you even look physically -
    <br>only to those who know you.
    <br>This drug can make you believe that the sky is red, even when the sky is blue.
    <br>It takes away the life source that is in you
    <br>such that it causes someone to have that deep hatred - not only for the world but also for himself.
    <br>It is only by the grace of God that one can get out of it.
    <br>I have got so many cases and examples of churches that I went to.
    <br>Before getting to that area, brother, tell us - for how many years were you addicted to these drugs?
    <br>From the time I was 13. I would say for approximately 18 years.
    <br>We can just Imagine what our brother is talking about. For 18 years he had this severe drug addiction.
    <br>You said that it came to a point where to finance this addiction, you had to go into crime.
    <br>Can you just explain what that spirit pushed you into doing to try and get money
    <br>to be able to maintain this addiction.
    <br>Under the control of these drugs, you lose your sense of heart,
    <br>and you would be willing to do anything.
    <br>It led me to partake in a few criminal activities which would augment my financial position
    <br>so that I could continue purchasing alcohol and drugs
    <br>and maintain that lifestyle which honestly leads to death.
    <br>All the good things I tried to do all failed.
    <br>Whether it was employment, business opportunities that could change the face of the country,
    <br>or community activities - they all failed.
    <br>But anything I touched that was bad, I succeeded, I flourished.
    <br>I was very well known and popular for being a 'bad boy'.
    <br>Maintaining that 'bad boy' image and status, you end up in a position where you sell your soul.
    <br>Where people get injured and people have to get hurt,
    <br>just for you to keep up with the spirit of that addiction.
    <br>You mentioned at the beginning that apart from drugs and alcohol,
    <br>this also gave you the spirit of lust, addiction to women and pornography.
    <br>Can you explain more about this as well.
    <br>Intoxication and the love for women go hand in hand.
    <br>It is like coffee and sugar - coffee, sugar and milk.
    <br>Whenever one gets addicted to intoxication of any form,
    <br>it brings on a spirit of lust -
    <br>both to the actual women, to pornography and things like that.
    <br>So I found myself having to go to strip clubs, just to keep up.
    <br>One does not have control of oneself, under any form whatsoever.
    <br>It is as though I was under mind control.
    <br>I didn't want to go to strip clubs but I couldn't help it.
    <br>I had no power, I had no ability to shake it off.
    <br>I had no ability to stand and say, "No, I am not going to do such".
    <br>I was under pure mind control and it was like living in a prison
    <br>where you could still see the light but you couldn't go towards the light.
    <br>You are in bondage, you are in chains and yet you can still see the freedom,
    <br>which is so much more painful than when you are in bondage and can't see what freedom is.
    <br>We can really understand from our brother what this pushed him to do.
    <br>Now brother, can you explain - had you ever before attempted to try and stop
    <br>taking these drugs and alcohol and what happened?
    <br>For many years, over a period of about five years, I have been on a quest
    <br>to get out of this life, to no avail whatsoever.
    <br>I have been to churches all over the country back at home in South Africa -
    <br>all to no avail.
    <br>This spirit was so powerful that when I prayed,
    <br>I would hear at the back of my mind something laughing at me.
    <br>Whenever pastors came and laid their hands on me, I would hear the spirit rebuking them.
    <br>It was so difficult to find deliverance especially back at home in South Africa
    <br>because it is given that deliverance comes at a price,
    <br>deliverance comes at a cost.
    <br>To give a practical example:
    <br>I would go to some churches and when it was offering time and I didn't have money at that point,
    <br>I couldn't really shout "Amen" as loud as I would like to shout "Amen".
    <br>But when I did have a lot of money, I would give a sizeable offering
    <br>and I would then feel confident enough to shout "Amen".
    <br>It made me to believe that deliverance comes at a cost.
    <br>Without actally awarding the pastor with a sizable offering or tithe, deliverance would not be possible.
    <br>Every single time I prayed and asked God for deliverance,
    <br>it wasn't a pure prayer because the prayer was based on money.
    <br>What I found here at The SCOAN was the freedom that comes with deliverance,
    <br>the peace that comes with deliverance and the ability to stand and have a clear and open mind,
    <br>to know myself and know that Christ is real, Jesus is real, He lives, He exists.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Brother, we still want you to come back to that point of your experience when you came here
    <br>but just before then, we want you to be a little bit more specific.
    <br>When you mentioned that some of the criminal activities you went into to try and fuel this drug addiction
    <br>by getting money. Just give an example of some of them that this spirit pushed you into
    <br>as an opportunity for other people to learn.
    <br>I engaged in quite a lot of fraudulent activities.
    <br>I am a relatively well connected individual back home.
    <br>We could foster some fraudulent activities,
    <br>which really gave us a lot of money like bank card schemes,
    <br>governmental contract schemes and so forth.
    <br>Car hijacking as well to which, funny enough, I also became a victim of.
    <br>It would provide quite a lot of money to an extent of about 30,000-40,000 rand a day.
    <br>But you wasted all that money on drugs?
    <br>Entertainment, intoxication, addiction, women and maintaining a bad reputation.
    <br>You talked about how you have been to so many places seeking for deliverance.
    <br>How did you actually come to hear about The SCOAN?
    <br>A relative of mine had come here a few years ago
    <br>in order to find deliverance for my brother who had cancer.
    <br>Unfortunately, my brother was in such a bad state that he couldn't come to The SCOAN.
    <br>A family representative had to come and she also got delivered upon coming here.
    <br>When she went back home, my brother was healed from cancer.
    <br>He was lying in bed...
    <br>Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>He was lying in bed and the doctors had told us there was no more hope.
    <br>The hospice had also told us that there was no more hope.
    <br>All they did was that they gave him tablets for him to die in peace.
    <br>By God's grace, in a week he was up and he was even driving my car.
    <br>That was after a family member came to the SCOAN and
    <br>returned and ministered the Morning Water to your brother?
    <br>Yes! That is correct.
    <br>If I remember correctly, she didn't even have to minister to him, her presence healed him,
    <br>when she came directly from The SCOAN.
    <br>Unfortunately at that time, I wasn't seeing myself as one to go to church.
    <br>You know bad boys don't go to church.
    <br>We don't do those kind of things. Cool guys remain in the bars,
    <br>cool guys remain with women. We don't go to church.
    <br>At that time, I was just grateful for my brother's life.
    <br>I was not bothered about how it came about. I did not care at all.
    <br>A few months ago, my dad reminded me of the miracle that happened to my brother.
    <br>He said to me, "Thoriso Maduna, I think you should go and visit The SCOAN".
    <br>God bless him for his wisdom because he knew how to talk.
    <br>Because if he had said to me that I have to go to The SCOAN, I wouldn't have come.
    <br>What he did is that he gave me a suggestion that maybe it could help me.
    <br>I thought to myself that all I was looking for was a solution,
    <br>I was looking for a way out because I had found out that there was a terrible spirit
    <br>behind everything I was doing and I was a mess.
    <br>When I came here to The SCOAN, I came with no expectation.
    <br>I came with no anticipation.
    <br>The only thing which I was looking for was answers and deliverance.
    <br>How it came about, I didn't mind.
    <br>From whom it came, how or what it really was, was not much of my concern.
    <br>All I was looking for was deliverance.
    <br>To my amazement, that deliverance came for free!
    <br>Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>At the back of my mind, somehow I was thinking to myself
    <br>that since now I am about to get delivered, I need to start putting money aside
    <br>because I had thought that deliverance doesn't come for free.
    <br>There is no high-rated man of God that I have met ... there must be money involved.
    <br>Just to show that the Holy Spirit is present here.
    <br>It came for free and it came in such a way which I did not expect.
    <br>I thank the Holy Spirit for allowing me to be able to receive deliverance.
    <br>For all the people who came from far and wide,
    <br>I know how it is like to look for a solution
    <br>such that you move all the way from your own country to come here
    <br>and believe me, it has been the best decision of my life.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We want you to explain to us exactly what happened in the service last week.
    <br>You were just sitting down,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua began moving in the midst of the people, and he came towards you.
    <br>Just describe to us what happened at that moment.
    <br>It was the most interesting experience.
    <br>I didn't know exactly what to expect. I can see myself over there.
    <br>I didn't know what to expect.
    <br>What happened was that,
    <br>as the man of God was laying hands on the people - I was seated in the back row -
    <br>as the man of God was approaching,
    <br>my spiritual eye opened and I saw myself getting ready for a fight.
    <br>Yet, I could see the man of God coming closer.
    <br>The closer the man of God came, the more I got ready for the fight.
    <br>Immediately he came and put his hand on me, I felt as though I was hit by a big hammer.
    <br>I felt no pain at all but that hammer hit me light out!
    <br>I don't know what happened, I have no idea or recollection of what is on the TV screen.
    <br>I don't know what happened.
    <br>I mean if I were to look, I wouldn't confirm that was me, I would deny it.
    <br>By the time I got up, I felt as though I just woke up from a deep slumber.
    <br>I felt alive, I felt as though I had been sleeping for a long time,
    <br>I woke up from a deep sleep.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I wasn't conscious of anything that was happening around me.
    <br>I literally woke up from a deep sleep,
    <br>I saw the camera here, the light was on my face,
    <br>the evangelists were preaching and there was a lot of noise.
    <br>I was looking around and thinking to myself, "What is going on?
    <br>Where am I? How did I get here?"
    <br>And for the first time I could think clearly.
    <br>For the first time after a long time, I could hear myself reason and say,
    <br>"I am in The SCOAN and this is my deliverance, and this is me speaking".
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Just tell us, brother, ever since that deliverance last week,
    <br>it has been one week now - what has happened to your life?
    <br>Thoriso Maduna - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I am not even going to talk about any cravings because there is no craving which exists.
    <br>Right now, it is an element which does not exist in my life.
    <br>It is as though it never existed in the past.
    <br>The cravings are no more, I don't know even know how it is like to crave anymore -
    <br>for drugs, alcohol, pornographic images, women, whatsoever.
    <br>I am free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean to say, brother, up to the point of your coming to The SCOAN
    <br>last week, you were still taking the drugs, alcohol, cigarettes?
    <br>It was only after your deliverance that you have stopped?
    <br>Yes! That is correct.
    <br>Even before I came, I somehow knew that it was the end.
    <br>I thought to myself, "Let me go out because it is going to be my last time".
    <br>But I found myself not having such a deep desire.
    <br>In fact, because I knew I was coming to The SCOAN,
    <br>I found myself wanting to read the Word more, so that I could understand a bit more where I am going.
    <br>Now, as you are standing here, it has been one week now.
    <br>You said before that this addiction literally controlled your life,
    <br>controlled your thinking, your reasoning faculties,
    <br>imprisoned you and blinded you from reality.
    <br>How are you reasoning, calculating and thinking right now?
    <br>I consider myself a super human.
    <br>My reasoning capacity has returned, I can think clearly, I can see clearly.
    <br>It's beautiful! It's beautiful for me to be myself again.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We know you are in a position to really give advice to people around the world,
    <br>especially those under the bondage of this kind of addiction.
    <br>We know around the world, it is such a serious problem -
    <br>people addicted to taking drugs, alcohol, smoking.
    <br>As someone that has passed through this addiction,
    <br>right now you are free from it and you are a living testimony.
    <br>What is your advice to people around the world,
    <br>especially young people who are still into this kind of addiction?
    <br>My advice is: I can understand and I know that you all want to be free.
    <br>The only way to get free is to know Jesus Christ.
    <br>There are no other means, there is no other way.
    <br>Pray hard and believe and find your genuine willingness to get deliverance
    <br>because the spirits of addiction and depression can only be taken away through deliverance.
    <br>There is no other way, there is no other mechanism that can assist.
    <br>My advice to everybody out there that is suffering from any kind of depression or addiction,
    <br>is to pray hard and have a genuine willingness to be delivered
    <br>and God will find you.
    <br>{Amen. Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Finally, we know that there are many people who look at the lifestyle of people that are addicted,
    <br>maybe they envy them or are jealous of them,
    <br>they look at them and think they are living a high life, a good life.
    <br>As someone that was into such lifestyle and was part and parcel of that addiction
    <br>what would you like to tell such people?
    <br>I would like to tell those people:
    <br>Firstly, those who are into such a lifestyle - 'the bad boys' of the world -
    <br>I feel your pain, I know your pain, it is painful.
    <br>Get out of it, it is not worth it!
    <br>There is only death - that lifestyle will lead to your death.
    <br>There are only two ways where your life is positioned: It is either in Christ or in the grave.
    <br>All of us want to live - move towards Christ!
    <br>Move towards the Holy Spirit
    <br>and get out of that lifestyle as soon as you can.
    <br>Believe that you can do it, have a genuine willingness to find God and to be delivered
    <br>and God will find you.
    <br>To those who envy the guys who are popular and everything, pray for them!
    <br>That's all I can say - they need your prayers!
    <br>Instead of envying them, pray for them because it is a very painful place to be in.
    <br>Amen. Let's all put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We know the evidence of Jesus is lives changed
    <br>and we thank God for the transformation in our brother's life.
    <br>We believe his testimony will inspire many people around the world
    <br>to also seek deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>and we believe we have learned many valuable lessons from his testimony.
    <br>We know that as you make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>the best is yet to come in Jesus' name!
