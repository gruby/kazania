  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>I'm joining you in the same atmosphere.
    <br>God's Word has the ability to quicken us spiritually.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God's Word has ability".
    <br>[God's Word has ability]
    <br>Ability to quicken us spiritually.
    <br>God's Word is Spirit.
    <br>Because it is Spirit, that is why it has that enablement.
    <br>It is not just a matter of...
    <br>No, it is beyond that.
    <br>When you speak it, it goes.
    <br>It cannot stay in your lips.
    <br>It goes and does things.
    <br>You say, "Let there be light!" - you see the light, because it has ability to quicken us spiritually.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the book of John 6.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the verse 63 there.
    <br>It says, "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing."
    <br>The Spirit gives life and the flesh counts for what?
    <br>For nothing!
    <br>The words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit.
    <br>This means the Word of God has the ability to quicken us spiritually.
    <br>The Word of God is a Spirit that has the ability to develop a spiritual force within our hearts called faith.
    <br>"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing."
    <br>This means the Spirit gives being, the flesh counts for nothing.
    <br>"The words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit and life." John 6:63.
    <br>This means the Word of God is not just words.
    <br>There is Bible language and the language of today.
    <br>The Word of God, a Spirit has the ability to develop a spiritual force within our hearts called faith.
    <br>What we call faith is something that develops within our hearts.
    <br>Take note of that; it is not just "faith in faith, faith in this or that".
    <br>We talk of faith in the Word of God, faith in the finished work of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>What we call faith in Jesus, faith in the finished works of our Lord, Jesus Christ
    <br>is something that develops within our hearts.
    <br>What we call faith...
    <br>Because there are faiths in faith, faith in this or that, faith in yourself...
    <br>We use the word "faith" like a literal word - no - there is more to that.
    <br>You say, "I will do the job by faith" - no, that is not the faith we are talking about here.
    <br>"By faith it will go, it will work..." - no, that is not the kind of faith we are talking about.
    <br>What we call, "Bible faith" is something that develops within our hearts -
    <br>a spiritual force that develops within our hearts.
    <br>How does this develop?
    <br>If you pay attention to God's Word, I mean, if you pay attention to God,
    <br>you will find that faith comes spontaneously, naturally.
    <br>If you pay attention - not this kind of attention Attention!...
    <br>The attention I'm talking about is attention with all your heart.
    <br>If you pay attention to God's Word…
    <br>How do pay attention?
    <br>By looking at God, looking on God, and meditating on the Word.
    <br>How do we meditate on the Word?
    <br>If I say, "The more you think..." I'm talking of mediation - it is more than thinking.
    <br>When I say, "The more you think..." it is no longer on your situation - on God.
    <br>The more you think about what you read, what you see around, what you hear,
    <br>the more you become familiar with His voice.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>When I say, "The more you think..." I mean meditation.
    <br>The more you think - I am talking of meditation.
    <br>Before you can get to meditation you must get through "think, think, think..."
    <br>That is meditation - "think, think, think..."
    <br>Not think - situation, more think - it is no longer your situation - on God.
    <br>Faith comes spontaneously, that is, naturally.
    <br>This is why you cannot have faith when you read your Bible the way you read literature.
    <br>When you read your Bible the way you read chemistry or physics, you cannot have faith
    <br>because faith comes spontaneously.
    <br>This is why you cannot have faith when you commit what you read to memory.
    <br>You memorise your Bible.
    <br>It is good to memorise, it is valuable but it must be an integral part of you.
    <br>It is good to memorise.
    <br>When you memorise the Bible, it is like storing water in your mouth.
    <br>When you want to drink and you store the water in your mouth without swallowing it, it's a waste.
    <br>If water remains in your mouth without swallowing it, it is a waste.
    <br>In the same vein, when you memorise the Bible without allowing this to be part of you,
    <br>to be an integral part of you, it is a waste.
    <br>You read your Bible, you begin to memorise the verses.
    <br>We memorise our Bible to preach, teach it, not to live it.
    <br>To live the Bible is to allow this to be an integral part of us.
    <br>Faith originates from God.
    <br>It originates from who?
    <br>[God.]
    <br>God.
    <br>It does not originate from ourselves.
    <br>This is why when you look around, at yourself, everywhere; you cannot find faith.
    <br>You look around, at yourself; you cannot find faith.
    <br>Once you realise that God is reliable, faith comes.
    <br>Ah! God is great!
    <br>It brings faith.
    <br>A "slot of faith".
    <br>Oh, how did this happen?
    <br>Oh, God is great!
    <br>It means God is reliable - He gives you a slot of faith.
    <br>You begin to develop that faith and it begins to grow more.
    <br>Another time; "Oh, I am healed. Glory be to God! It can only be God."
    <br>Another plot of faith.
    <br>Your faith is growing gradually.
    <br>It comes spontaneously.
    <br>This is why the theologians, many authors writing about the Bible - they have no faith.
    <br>Authors of many books about the Bible don't have faith.
    <br>They are well educated, they are authors but they have no faith.
    <br>That you have a Bible does not mean you have faith.
    <br>That you are a Christian, as you claim, does not mean you have faith.
    <br>That you are a bishop, prophet, does not mean you have faith.
    <br>That you know Jesus does not mean you have faith until Jesus knows you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "That you know Jesus does not mean you have faith in Jesus until Jesus knows you."
    <br>Yes, that you know Jesus, you preach Jesus and people can see you are a good preacher;
    <br>it does not mean you have faith.
    <br>... until Jesus knows you.
    <br>Jesus can only know us by His faith, not by our faith; by His obedience, not by our obedience;
    <br>by His humility, not by our humility.
    <br>You see people that are very humble and simple, but it is not of God.
    <br>You can see people that are very faithful to you, but not of God.
    <br>People can be very obedient, to you - yeah, he is an obedient child - but not of God.
    <br>The Bible said it, "These I have given you, not as the world gives them".
    <br>Everything Jesus has given, the world can also give the same but with conditions.
    <br>If you don't look at it very well you may not know the difference.
    <br>This is why today we don't know the difference between this and that.
    <br>When it comes to things of the Spirit, we are ignorant.
    <br>"These I have given you, not as the world gives them" it means all Jesus is giving out,
    <br>the world can give also, but with a difference.
    <br>What is the difference?
    <br>The difference is the end.
    <br>Beginnings may look similar, the middles may look similar, but the end is always different.
    <br>The end proves the difference.
    <br>The beginning looks| similar, you may ignorantly not know the difference.
    <br>The middle - at the same time you may ignorantly not know the difference, because we are desperate.
    <br>Because of our desperation we don't know the difference.
    <br>Desperate to be this, that, to get there - we don't mind how it comes, how it looks,
    <br>since he gave you the same thing.
    <br>If the end of what you are doing is not going to be good - it has no meaning.
    <br>It is better not to do it at all.
    <br>We have seen the end of many.
    <br>Beginning - flourish, middle seems to flourish, but the end - crying, lamenting, sorrow.
    <br>Our end should not end when we pass on to glory.
    <br>Our work should not end when we end the journey.
    <br>If not, no one will remember you.
    <br>You are living, but the children yet unborn to remember that someone lived before...
    <br>But when there is no record once the journey ends - of what value...?
    <br>If all the effort of the apostles ended at their time, people like me would not be here today.
    <br>They paid the supreme price to bring the Gospel.
    <br>Because the Gospel did not end at their time, at the end of they journey -
    <br>this is why people like me are still here today to preach the Gospel.
    <br>What are you doing that makes you sure and believe that it will not end when your journey ends?
    <br>What are you doing?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What are you doing now that will not end when your journey ends?"
    <br>What are you doing?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, " What are you doing that children yet unborn will live to see?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour again.
    <br>[What are you doing that children yet unborn will live to see?]
    <br>That is the question for you to answer.
    <br>What are you doing that children yet unborn will live to see when you end your journey?
    <br>Just like in case of apostles - we are children yet unborn at their time.
    <br>Today we are seen, we are enjoying the price they paid.
    <br>The word "faith" led us to this.
    <br>Faith comes spontaneously.
    <br>It is not the work of reading, righteousness, sweating or whatever you have done
    <br>that brings faith – it comes spontaneously, naturally.
    <br>This is why you cannot receive that faith when you read your Bible the way you read literature.
    <br>This is why it is difficult for someone to acquire faith after finishing theology school.
    <br>It is very difficult.
    <br>You acquire that knowledge, but that faith is always difficult to acquire.
    <br>When you read your Bible the way you read literature you cannot acquire the faith we are talking about.
    <br>Because, like I have said, what we call faith is something that has an ability
    <br>to develop a spiritual force within our hearts.
    <br>It is beyond ordinary reading.
    <br>It must be reading with devotion.
    <br>It must be reading with what?
    <br>[Devotion.]
    <br>With devotion.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It is beyond ordinary reading – it must be reading with devotion."
    <br>Quality time is what we call.
    <br>When I say read something with devotion it means read it in your quality time.
    <br>In a good time, not in a waste time.
    <br>You know we read our Bible at the waste time, when we don't have anything to do, in the time we don't value,
    <br>when we are tired.
    <br>But the Bible must be read in the quality time, your best time, cherished time, not in the time you are tired,
    <br>when you don't have anything else to do, you are about to sleep - no!
    <br>So that - your spirit can be at its best.
    <br>When your spirit is not at its best and you are reading your Bible, you are wasting your time.
    <br>Your spirit must be at its best
    <br>because when your spirit is not at its best, you cannot meditate; you can only think.
    <br>We think when our spirit is not at its best.
    <br>We meditate when our spirit is at its best.
    <br>Do you understand the word, "spirit being at its best"?
    <br>When there is no burden.
    <br>You know, when there is so much burden on us you are worried - so much burden.
    <br>Weight on your spirit.
    <br>If your spirit is not at its best, it cannot attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>If your spirit is not at its best, it cannot attract what?
    <br>[Spirit of God.]
    <br>It cannot attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>Your spirit must be at its best to attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>That is, when your spirit is free.
    <br>That is what I mean.
    <br>For our spirit to be at its best means to be free - free spirit.
    <br>When you don't think of anything you are relaxed.
    <br>You just look at yourself and smile.
    <br>Not looking at yourself and crying.
    <br>You know, oftentimes you look at yourself and cry.
    <br>You may not necessarily cry but you feel so disgusting - you hate yourself.
    <br>Free spirit, let someone say, "Free spirit".
    <br>[Free spirit.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Free spirit.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Free spirit.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Free spirit.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Free spirit.]
    <br>Can you tell me how often you have a free spirit?
    <br>Have you actually had a free spirit ever before?
    <br>Because it id difficult; you have so much to think about.
    <br>You can only have a free spirit when you start your thinking by this:
    <br>"If today is my last day on earth, what else?"
    <br>Start your thinking from there.
    <br>Start your thinking from where?
    <br>To have a free spirit you must start your thinking this way:
    <br>"If today is my last day on this earth, what  would they remember me for?"
    <br>Once you start your thinking like that, you find yourself thinking the more...
    <br>now meditation comes.
    <br>Thinking about it alone will make you forget your situation.
    <br>When you come to that understanding, "if today is your last day on earth, what else?",
    <br>you will soon understand what free spirit means.
    <br>You need free spirit to have faith.
    <br>When your spirit is at its best, you are smelling the faith of God.
    <br>When your spirit is at its best, it means free spirit; then, you can attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>He joins Himself to our spirit to declare us children of God.
    <br>He joins Himself to our spirit to heal and deliver us.
    <br>"Ha! I'm sick. In Jesus' name - be healed", and you are healed.
    <br>It means that the Spirit of God joined Himself to your spirit to heal you.
    <br>For the Spirit to join Himself to your spirit, your spirit must be free
    <br>and when it's free, then it attracts the Spirit of God.
    <br>But when it is not free and is in bondage, trouble - then it attracts the evil spirits.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Will you allow free spirit?"
    <br>[Will you allow free spirit?]
    <br>It is your duty to do that.
    <br>Jesus will not come to do that for you.
    <br>It is your role to do that before the Spirit of God comes.
    <br>Jesus will not come to give you a free spirit.
    <br>It is your duty to allow this.
    <br>You just have to put everything behind you.
    <br>Let your past pass and move forward.
    <br>Know that there is no one without limitations.
    <br>If you say you have a problem - there is no one without limitation.
    <br>You may have problem, you may have sickness - other people have other problems.
    <br>There is no one on this earth, including even T.B. Joshua - no one without limitation.
    <br>When you know there is no one without limitation, you allow a free spirit.
    <br>There is no one without limitation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[There is no one without limitation.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[There is no one without limitation.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[There is no one without limitation.]
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This limitation makes our journey more valuable, more interesting.
    <br>Limitation makes our Christian life more interesting, more valuable.
    <br>"I am a Christian without limitation" - you are not a Christian.
    <br>Limitation will continue to draw you closer to God.
    <br>Fast the more, pray the more, seek His face the more.
    <br>Limitation makes us pay attention to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My limitation makes me pay attention to God."
    <br>The more I pray, the more I seek His face.
    <br>Without limitation there is no need for attention.
    <br>What brought you here today?
    <br>I'm very sure your coming here is not out of comfort, out of pleasure, out of abundant blessing.
    <br>Without limitation your faith is no real faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Without limitation, my faith is no real faith."
    <br>Faith works on limitations.
    <br>Limitation makes our faith more valuable.
    <br>What is your limitation?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>[What is your limitation?]
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>[What is your limitation?]
    <br>You can be kind enough to tell your neighbour your limitation.
    <br>Can you be kind enough?
    <br>Can you be kind enough to tell your neighbour your limitation?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Can you be kind enough to tell me your limitation?"
    <br>[Can you be kind enough to tell me your limitation?]
    <br>Let me tell you; if any of your neighbours tells you his own limitations - that is not limitation.
    <br>Limitation is something you would never discuss with anyone.
    <br>When you tell your neighbour, "This is my limitation" - this is not a limitation, it is your situation.
    <br>If anybody is telling you his limitation; he is not telling you his limitation but his situation.
    <br>Limitation is something that...
    <br>When you are praying to God to remove that limitations, you would be looking around.
    <br>When somebody knocks the door... "Hosanna".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you be kind enough and tell me your limitation?
    <br>You will tell me your situation.
    <br>Limitation is what actually limits you from eating with Jesus on the table,
    <br>from kissing Jesus, you can kiss Him, from understanding His voice.
    <br>You don't understand His voice.
    <br>When you dream you don't know whether it is a real dream or a nightmare.
    <br>We don't understand His voice.
    <br>We are not familiar with His voice.
    <br>If you are familiar with God's voice, you know when satan is talking and when God is talking.
    <br>Voices are always in your heart.
    <br>You know, I say, faith has ability to develop a spiritual force within our hearts.
    <br>Like you are listening to me now - the word will continue to develop a force within your heart.
    <br>You will find yourself being transformed.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>It has ability to develop a spiritual force within our heart, called faith.
    <br>There is more.
    <br>When the Bible says, "Faith comes by hearing the Word of God",
    <br>it does not end be saying, "Faith comes by hearing".
    <br>To hear the Word of Faith, one must pay attention.
    <br>To pay attention is to look at God, look on God and meditate on the Word.
    <br>How can we look at God?
    <br>When you are listening to the ministers of God, all attention, with all your hearts, you have to pray along.
    <br>Like you are looking at me - you have to pray along to understand.
    <br>It is not just looking at me to understand, you have to begin to pray along, "God, give me a hearing heart.
    <br>Lord Jesus, give me a hearing heart".
    <br>While you listen to the word, "Give me a hearing heart".
    <br>When the minister of God is preaching or you are at home listening to the Christian channel you say,
    <br>"Lord, give me a hearing heart".
    <br>Because what you hear must go to your heart.
    <br>Because the word of Faith you hear is a spiritual force within your heart.
    <br>A hearing heart.
    <br>When you pray along like that, when you listen to the word, you have a breakthrough.
    <br>It comes spontaneously, it just comes.
    <br>Because this very body cannot hear the word of Faith.
    <br>There is so much to think about.
    <br>Burden - our spirit, our heart is in prison.
    <br>You need a free spirit to hear the Word of Faith.
    <br>"Give me a hearing heart."
    <br>That should be your prayer now.
    <br>You begin to "fire on" - "Give me a hearing heart".
    <br>Don't wait till it is said, "Let's pray" - no.
    <br>Your life should depend on that, "Give me a hearing heart".
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Hallelujah!
