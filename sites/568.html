  <p>    
    <br>WARNING!
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers,
    <br>it is for the glory of God.
    <br>This young boy sits uneasily in his chair
    <br>breathing in little gasps at the pain he is going through.
    <br>The top of his thigh is swollen and looks painful,
    <br>but that is only a symptom of the hideous knee cancer
    <br>which had eaten right to the bone of this little boy's right leg.
    <br>The skin hangs off around the cancerous sore,
    <br>dripping with infected body fluids and blood.
    <br>The flesh of his right leg is greatly reduced
    <br>and the cancer is getting bigger,
    <br>claiming more and more of the boy's leg.
    <br>Looking down to the floor,
    <br>let us see just how far the cancer has spread
    <br>from the base of his thigh down to the knee joint.
    <br>What an awful time this young boy is going through
    <br>at such an early stage in his life.
    <br>For whatever your age is
    <br>pain is a language understood by all.
    <br>Let us hear from him.
    <br>My name is Godwin Christopher. I am nine years old.
    <br>What is the problem that has brought you here to The SCOAN?
    <br>I have a knee ulcer.
    <br>What are your experiences with this problem of a knee ulcer?
    <br>It hurts. I cannot go to school.
    <br>What do you believe God Almighty will do for you?
    <br>God Almighty will heal me.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Here, nine year old Godwin Christopher is seen receiving prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua at The SCOAN prayer line.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>As the man of God prays, in the name of Jesus, a wave of his hand declared Godwin free
    <br>and he walked that day in the light of his testimony.
    <br>A month later, Godwin Christopher returned to The SCOAN with an awesome testimony:
    <br>His knee ulcer was completely healed.
    <br>Glory be to God! You can tell that there has been a complete change in this young boy's life.
    <br>He sits comfortably without the former tension and pain which was in his expression last time he visited the church.
    <br>Now, wearing a pair of shorts, he shows off his completely healed knee.
    <br>The little scar tissue is all that is left of the once rampant cancerous sore that previously covered the boy's leg.
    <br>Compared with the condition on the left, his skin looks so healthy and strong.
    <br>WATCH How This ROTTING LEG is RESTORED!!!
    <br>He hits his knee again and again demonstrating his restoration.
    <br>- Are you having any pain?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- You said there's no pain?
    <br>- No pain.
    <br>WATCH How This ROTTING LEG is RESTORED!!!
    <br>Doing what he could not do before the prayer, Godwin puts on his shoe without pain.
    <br>Now I can wear my shoes; I have no more pain.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Christopher. I am from Cross River State, Nigeria.
    <br>Who is this boy and what is his name?
    <br>He is my son. His name is Godwin Christopher.
    <br>Can you tell us the problem that brought your son the very first day to The SCOAN?
    <br>The problem was a leg ulcer.
    <br>It all started like a boil.
    <br>I thought it was just a common thing.
    <br>I didn't know that it was something that could take my life and my child's life.
    <br>I was running here and there.
    <br>Later, he was sent away from school when his leg started smelling.
    <br>I took him to hospital. Our clinic was not able to help him.
    <br>They referred us to a general hospital.
    <br>I took a loan from a cooperative bank - over N300,000.
    <br>I spent that money running here and there.
    <br>I sold most of my property.
    <br>Most of my friends ran away from me.
    <br>Nobody could come and eat with me or come to my house
    <br>because everywhere smelt bad.
    <br>The doctors said they would amputate his leg.
    <br>I thought those who are moving with two legs cannot eat or make it.
    <br>What about someone moving with one leg? Where would he start from?
    <br>If I put two pillows under his leg, they would be soaked with water.
    <br>I didn't know where that water was coming from and it smelt so bad.
    <br>I didn't know that even a dead body could smell like that.
    <br>I had been searching for the past three years for a solution.
    <br>Tell us what happened after the healing of your son.
    <br>After the man of God prayed for him, his leg still leaked water.
    <br>A little while later, the water stopped.
    <br>After the water stopped, the leg started to close and heal.
    <br>This is the leg. There is nothing wrong with the leg.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Many people have come to me asking where I went to heal my son's leg.
    <br>Even his headmaster came to my house.
    <br>Even his doctor has become my good friend until today.
    <br>My name is Godwin Christopher.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a knee ulcer.
    <br>When I had the problem, I could not walk, play football or do anything.
    <br>My father brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>and when the man of God prayed for me, my leg was healed.
    <br>Now, I can play football; I can do anything.
    <br>Amen. Now you can play football.
    <br>Can you walk in the midst of the children of God and show us the mighty things God has done in your life?
    <br>Godwin walks up and down without hesitation, as if there was never any problem.
    <br>To God be the glory.

    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
