  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Don't forget our last message:
    <br>What you do to your neighbour...
    <br>Use your mouth to finish it.
    <br>What you do to your neighbour, you do to God.
    <br>So, what you are doing to us is not fair.
    <br>You don't give us any breathing space.
    <br>I was passing around 2-3 am in the morning and I was seeing people hanging around.
    <br>Can you imagine; the workers in the house of God haven't slept since yesterday.
    <br>They can't leave you on the main road in the night and sleep.
    <br>Since yesterday, you people were on the main road around 2-3 am.
    <br>That you do to your neighbour, that you do to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>You remember the last meeting - it was air-condition throughout, we put it on from the beginning to the end.
    <br>And you know the cost of air-condition.
    <br>Let us reflect on our social life - the cost of running our air-condition generator,
    <br>and the workers in the church today.
    <br>We cannot begin bothering distressed people -
    <br>I mean, the sick ones, the poor ones - asking for financial support
    <br>though it is scriptural.
    <br>But the question remains: Whom are we asking for support?
    <br>The distressed, the sick, the poor.
    <br>When you are delivered, your "Thank you" is a blessing from God.
    <br>When you are healed, your "Thank you" is a blessing from God.
    <br>But when you are distressed, your "Thank you" is distress
    <br>because you are your "Thank you".
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[You are your "thank you"]
    <br>Because you cannot live above your word.
    <br>I am my "Thank you".
    <br>You are your "Thank you".
    <br>That is why most gifts today are a curse, not a blessing.
    <br>You see people who greet you, "Good Morning, daddy".
    <br>Most of "Good Morning, daddy. Good Morning, sir" are a curse, not a blessing.
    <br>Most offerings collected in the churches all over the world are a curse, not a blessing.
    <br>I am my "Thank you".
    <br>You are your "Thank you" because you cannot live above your word.
    <br>You are your "Thank you".
    <br>I am my "Thank you".
    <br>This is why most gifts you receive today are a curse, not a blessing.
    <br>This is why most blessings you receive are a curse, not a blessing.
    <br>This is why you have to be very careful.
    <br>After the service, we will see whom to collect offering from.
    <br>How will you know the distressed, the sick, the poor?
    <br>After their deliverance you will know them.
    <br>You will know whom to collect blessing from.
    <br>If we don't ask your offering; not that we don't know, not that it is not scriptural - it is scriptural.
    <br>Whom are we asking for financial support?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>So, I want to leave you here.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Question again:
    <br>You are your what?
    <br>[You are your "Thank you".]
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[You are your "Thank you".]
    <br>I am my "Thank you" because you cannot live above your word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[I am my "Thank you" because you cannot live above your word.]
    <br>You are your "Thank you".
    <br>I am my "Thank you" because I cannot live above my word.
    <br>When you are distressed, your "Thank you" is distress.
    <br>When you are sick, your "Thank you" is sick.
    <br>For me to stand here and begin to say, "Your offering, thanksgiving, this, that..."
    <br>From whom?
    <br>The sick ones? The poor ones? The rich ones?
    <br>Your heart will tell you whom you are.
    <br>It is a thing of the heart.
    <br>We have received a lot of emails people keep sending to us;
    <br>no offering, no thanksgiving, every Living Water Service...
    <br>We ask offering from whom?
    <br>Distressed?
    <br>Sick?
    <br>Worried people?
    <br>When they are delivered, their "Thank you" is a blessing from God.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>And immediately they ask you, "Who are you? What is the problem?"
    <br>You say you have cancer and you move to the mountain.
    <br>By the time you get to the mountain, you get relieved, you say, "I'm healed".
    <br>Not immediately, you cannot have anything immediately.
    <br>You are just happy.
    <br>By the time you get home, you begin to say, "Oh my God, I need to support the ministry".
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>The next thing is: "I need to support this ministry.
    <br>I have spent a fortune over this trouble. I need to support this ministry."
    <br>For now, you don't have, but getting home, "I need to support the ministry".
    <br>The word, "I need to support the ministry" will also bless you to bless ministry.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Take note again:
    <br>If we don't ask your offering or thanksgiving or whatever...
    <br>You are expecting us to ask - it is a normal thing.
    <br>It is scriptural to ask but whom are we asking?
    <br>Distressed, poor ones?
    <br>You see many people that look beautiful, handsome.
    <br>If you go deep to their lives, you will know they borrowed money to be here today.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Are we to ask them to share with us out of the money they borrowed?
    <br>For offering - the money they borrowed to be here; they should give part of it to the ministry?
    <br>Appearance is deceptive.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Appearance is deceptive.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Appearance is deceptive.]
    <br>Appearance is deceptive. You see people with beautiful gowns.
    <br>Their appearance is - oh my God.
    <br>By the time you go deep, you will know that much of what that they put on is borrowed.
    <br>Or you now move to the car park, you look at posh cars people brought,
    <br>"Oh, this is a posh car - they must be very rich."
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>A decorated slave.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "A decorated slave."
    <br>I know people beyond appearance.
    <br>Say, "I know people beyond appearance."
    <br>Tell your neighbour again. 
    <br>[I know people beyond appearance.]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[I know people beyond appearance.]
    <br>That is me.
    <br>Sometimes when you greet me when I'm moving around, you say, "Good Morning, sir",
    <br>I would look at your heart - your heart does not say, "Good Morning".
    <br>Some would say, "Emmanuel, sir", I would look at your heart;
    <br>your heart did not say, "Emmanuel, sir".
    <br>This is what I'm saying.
    <br>Most greetings today are not a blessing but a curse.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Most greetings today are not a blessing but a curse.]
    <br>Most gifts; they send a gift to you, you think it is a gift - you see it as beautiful...
    <br>Most gifts are a curse, not a blessing.
    <br>That is why our life is like this today.
    <br>People you think are helping you - they are not helping you.
    <br>What is given to you is not from their heart.
    <br>That is why you are like this.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>That is why you are what you are.
    <br>Look at the utterances and all other.
    <br>I remember the political parties in our country.
    <br>After the elections, you see people that were throwing insults to themselves,
    <br>they become friends after the elections.
    <br>That is to show that most respects are not a blessing but a curse.
    <br>In your office you tell your colleague, "I want to go and greet MD, that foolish man".
    <br>This is what you say in the office,
    <br>"That MD, I'm going to greet him - foolish man, cockroach."
    <br>Your colleague will say, "Go and come back".
    <br>You knock the door.
    <br>"Good Morning, sir".
    <br>MD will say, "Stand up. Good girl."
    <br>He doesn't know that it is evil.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Whatever you are going to say at this moment, let it come from your heart.
    <br>You cannot live above your word.
    <br>You must mean whatever you say here because you cannot live above your word.
    <br>What you are going to say now, you must mean it.
    <br>Have mercy on me.
    <br>Son of David, have mercy on me.
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me.
    <br>Let Your favour lead me.
    <br>Mean it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Mean it".
    <br>You cannot live above your word.
    <br>Mean it.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Mean it]
    <br>Because you cannot live above your word.
    <br>Say, "Mean it".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Mean it]
    <br>Because you cannot live above your word.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>I'm leaving you with your heart.
    <br>Let your heart say this.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Praying
    <br>On The SCOAN Altar
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>I'm one of you, so when you are going to the Living Water, I will follow you.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Listen to this:
    <br>Let your heart lead you.
    <br>Mean it.
    <br>Don't go because it is your turn.
    <br>I'm not going because it is my turn.
    <br>I'm going because the Lord says I should go.
    <br>Listen to the voice of God right in your heart.
    <br>Are you ready to go there?
    <br>Have you reconciled your account?
    <br>Have you forgiven, put the pain of the past behind you?
    <br>OK, you must mean it, because not every going there is going there.
    <br>Many will go there and fetch tap water while many will go there and fetch the anointed one.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>But let us know the challenges you are facing now for the testimony of others.
    <br>The Bible says the transgressions shall be converted through their testimony.
    <br>Welcome to the Living Water Service.
    <br>As you are coming forward, remember whatever challenges that brought you,
    <br>any afflictions, sickness, pain on your body,
    <br>be free to share that as you step into the mountain of prayer,
    <br>because of the belief and the faith you have in your heart that as you step
    <br>into the mountain of prayer, you will not come back with that problem.
    <br>Right now, as you are going, share with us what the problem is that has brought you today.
