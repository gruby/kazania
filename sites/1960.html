    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Wave your hand and give thanks to God.
    <br>Give thanks to Him; the Lord is good all the time.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>If God has not promised anything, how can we say He is faithful?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Are you ready now?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Right now, I will join you to remove whatever hindrance or barrier between you and God.
    <br>That is the first thing we need to do.
    <br>'Whatever barrier' - you know there could be a barrier between you and God.
    <br>The barrier could be sin, weaknesses - whatever the barrier is, I will join you in prayer.
    <br>You open your lips now.
    <br>We want to move that mountain; we are going to move that mountain right now.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>I will join you to move the mountain, move the barrier.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to join you to move the barrier right now.
    <br>There is a deliverance vessel in the house; there is a healing vessel in the house.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever medium you are using to view us,
    <br>all you need to do is to use your faith to put a demand on the anointing.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>That is good news for you right now that the vessel is in the house.
    <br>Right now, let us move the barrier between you and God.
    <br>Whatever is the barrier - sin, weaknesses - I will join you right now to move the barrier.
    <br>Begin to move the barrier.
    <br>We're going to move the mountain right now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You barrier, be moved, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When Jesus says yes, who can say no?
    <br>I say to you barrier - move, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever that barrier, whatever it is - be moved, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever the barrier, whatever it is,
    <br>weaknesses, sin or whatever - be moved, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say to the barrier - move, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, be free to receive blessing!
    <br>Be free to receive deliverance!
    <br>Be free to receive healing!
    <br>Your healing is on the way to you!
    <br>Your deliverance is on the way to you!
    <br>Get ready to receive your blessing!
    <br>Get ready to receive your freedom, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It is time now to receive your blessing because right now, the barrier has been removed
    <br>The barrier has been moved; your deliverance is on the way to you.
    <br>Right now, can you feel what I am feeling?
    <br>Confess it with your mouth and begin to act it.
    <br>Not only should you confess that freedom and deliverance are on the way,

    <br>I can see deliverance coming.
    <br>Confess this: "I can see deliverance coming; I can see the blessing coming -
    <br>it is on the way to me, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Right now, get ready to receive your deliverance.
    <br>Be ready to receive your deliverance.
    <br>Deliverance means a free spirit.
    <br>Many believe that deliverance is just deliverance from this or that...
    <br>No, a free spirit; you need to be free, you need a free spirit to act with God.
    <br>You need a free spirit to engage in His projects; God has His own project He wants to give you.
    <br>You need to engage in God's projects.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Delierance means what?
    <br>A free spirit.
    <br>When you have a free spirit, you will be able to pray and know -
    <br>you will know God's will and promise, even before you pray.
    <br>We pray today without knowing God's will, without knowing God's promise.
    <br>What you are asking for - "God, give me a biscuit" - do you know whether it is the will of God to give it to you?
    <br>If it is not His will, no matter how much you pray, you are wasting your time.
    <br>A free spirit - when you have a free spirit, it does not mean you will not have problems
    <br>but those problems will not matter to you; you will leave them for God.
    <br>You will not even think about your problems.
    <br>People will see that you have problems but that you do not even think about them; you think about God.
    <br>Because you know God's will first.
    <br>So, that is what we mean by 'deliverance'.
    <br>God can only dwell in a free spirit.
    <br>A free spirit is where faith lives; a free spirit is where joy lives; a free spirit is where God lives.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart, man's spirit - this means we need a free spirit.
    <br>When you begin to see yourself doing the same things...
    <br>You say you are a liar; you don't want to lie but you keep lying.
    <br>You keep praying, but you keep lying.
    <br>It means it is a satanic covenant.
    <br>Or a spirit of anger - when you finish being angry you feel embarrassed.
    <br>But that does not stop you from finding yourself angry again the next time
    <br>and this becomes an issue to you, an issue that is bothering you so much.
    <br>'I have the spirit of anger; I want to leave this spirit but it keeps repeating.'
    <br>Know that it is a satanic covenant.
    <br>Every satanic covenant in your life - out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Every satanic covenant of attitude - out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Every satanic covenant of character - out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to nail them - every satanic covenant.
    <br>Every satanic covenant - satanic covenant of attitude, of character -
    <br>open your lips, right now: "Leave!"

    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>If you mean it when you call the name, Jesus - you can flush them out once and for all.
    <br>Like if you take poison and immediately vomit it out, you find yourself flushing it out.
    <br>If you mean that name, Jesus - not just calling the name but you mean it - that name can flush it all out.
    <br>It has an authority; hallelujah.
    <br>Every satanic covenant - covenant of attitude, character -
    <br>right now, open your lips and begin to command them out of your life.

    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen!
    <br>Every satanic covenant - covenant of character, covenant of attitude -
    <br>the name, Jesus - mean it!
    <br>It is not the noise you are making that matters; what matters is the name, Jesus.
    <br>Mean it - you can just flush them out!
    <br>Covenant of character, covenant of attitude - in the name of Jesus, I flush them out!
    <br>All character, attitude - in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Mean it, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Begin to think about your life.
    <br>If your life belongs to Jesus genuinely today, what a sweet and awesome life.
    <br>Think about your life.
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself - viewers, do you know 'next'?
    <br>That is Jesus; when you have Jesus today, you will begin to know 'next' -
    <br>what next to do, what will happen next.
    <br>All this will not happen to you unprepared.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Every spirit that disturbs you...
    <br>You want to be happy but you don't know why you are not.
    <br>Many times, you will not hear any bad news, there is no attack, nobody offends you, but you become unhappy.
    <br>You cannot explain why you are not happy; there are many times like that.
    <br>Every spirit that disturbs your peace, that disturbs your breakthrough, that attacks your health -
    <br>nightmares - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every spirit that is disturbing you, I put them into a cage, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The spirit that kills your career, that is trying to destroy your career,
    <br>that is trying to steal your property, your health - be caged, in the name of Jesus!
