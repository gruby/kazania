    <br>US ELECTION 2020 PROPHECY!!!   Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Prophesy On The American Election - 2020
    <br>TB Joshua
    <br>What is happening in the American Election is as a result of the power in the tongue. The word we speak determines the life we enjoy (Proverbs 6:2).
    <br>The tongue can either work for us or against us - death and life lie in the tongue (Proverbs 18:21).
    <br>We Christians would have loved it to go the way we wanted. But the Bible says it is never proper to base our faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>We should not worry. The joy is that the new Supreme Court judge, Amy Coney Barrett, will be an instrument of check.
    <br>Finally, let us learn how to believe that God hears us when we pray - it is a much greater blessing.
    <br>There is likely going to be pockets of resistance here and there after the election but nothing will change.
    <br>Let me reserve what I am seeing until the inauguration of the new president.
