  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we have received the Word of God.
    <br>What a wonderful grace.
    <br>What a God we serve.
    <br>I can see God's healing, God's deliverance touching you.
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching you.
    <br>One thing we must know -
    <br>God will not move us to pray for something that is not sanctioned by the Scripture.
    <br>Your heart must act upon the Word.
    <br>Your heart must act upon the Word because God will not move me
    <br>to pray for something that is not sanctioned by the Scripture.
    <br>Receive a hearing heart!
    <br>A hearing heart is an obedient heart.
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command that deliverance on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command all unclean spirits operating in your life to leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Spirit of failure,
    <br>spirit of setback,
    <br>spirit of nightmare,
    <br>spirit of affliction - leave my people!
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used,
    <br>whatever medium satan might have used to connect you to himself -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can hear chains falling -
    <br>chain of affliction,
    <br>chain of setback,
    <br>chain of failure,
    <br>chain of disease.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, receive a new direction!
    <br>Receive a new focus!
    <br>Receive a new direction!
    <br>Receive a new focus, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can hear breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>In your business - breakthrough!
    <br>In your career - breakthrough!
    <br>In your marriage - breakthrough!
    <br>In your health - breakthrough!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
