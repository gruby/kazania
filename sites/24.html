  <p>    
    <br>My name is Neil reporting for Emmanuel TV and God is still saying something.
    <br>On Sunday, the 4th of January 2009, Prophet T.B. Joshua revealed a prophetic message
    <br>concerning a great star who would go on a journey of no return. Let's listen to what he said:
    <br>Fast and pray, use Psalm 91 and take note of verses 7, 8, 9.
    <br>Please, can somebody read there.
    <br>Psalm 91, from verse 7 to 9:
    <br>"A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh thee.
    <br>Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked
    <br>because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation."
    <br>Thank you. Pray!
    <br>I'm seeing a great star whom the world are shouting: "Hey, hey, hey!"
    <br>In his own area, he is famous, he is known everywhere.
    <br>Great, too great!
    <br>Because I see something will begin to happen to that star
    <br>and that may likely end him to pack his load and go to the journey of no return.
    <br>But I don't know when that journey.
    <br>Just over a month later on Sunday, the 22nd of February 2009,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a further call to pray for this star who he said was between life and death.
    <br>This is what he said:
    <br>Last time, there was a message given concerning somebody who is between life and death.
    <br>Not in your community here.
    <br>I said we should pray.
    <br>I want you to raise up your voice.
    <br>If it is the will of God, there's nothing we can do about it.
    <br>But raise up your voice; at your private, pray for this person.
    <br>When it happens, you will know something happened.
    <br>He is too young to leave your midst.
    <br>On Thursday, the 25th of June 2009, international music icon and the most famous pop star of modern times,
    <br>Michael Jackson, the King of Pop, died following a cardiac arrest in Los Angeles, California.
    <br>Let's see the report.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>Word spreads in Los Angeles and word spreads around the United States, around the world
    <br>right now that Michael Jackson has died.
    <br>According to the Los Angeles Times, he suffered from cardiac arrest, was rushed the UCLA Medical Center.
    <br>Paramedics brought him there, tried to revive him.
    <br>Inside the hospital we were told he went into a coma.
    <br>Now, the LA Times reporting that he's dead.
    <br>Hello, I am Natalie Allen at the check of the headlines.
    <br>CNN's special Legend Of A Thriller starts right now.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>You know the last few minutes we've been following some reports coming up, we're checking into this now.
    <br>It could be some breaking news.
    <br>These reports are that Michael Jackson, the former King of Pop has been taken to a Los Angeles hospital.
    <br>Right here is Michael's house.
    <br>Michael Jackson suffered cardiac arrest this afternoon.
    <br>He was rushed to UCLA Medical Center, paramedics responded to a 911 call at his home.
    <br>Michael Jackson, 50 years old, the King of Pop has died - a very very sad moment.
    <br>Folks are starting to gather here outside of his home. There's a small crowd just down the street.
    <br>I think it's just not really real right now, you know we just came over here
    <br>hoping that he was still in a coma and you know, it's just kind of...
    <br>We are huge fans, we listen to him, we drive by here everyday.
    <br>Everyday, we're like: "Oh, maybe we should stop by and see if we can see him."
    <br>I've seen him once and it's just like you never really think that something like this will happen.
    <br>Normally outside of his home there are about a half dozen vans of his die-hard fans -
    <br>people who actually live out here in their vans because they want to be close to this pop superstar.
    <br>All of those people have moved over to the hospital because they want to be closer to where he is,
    <br>they want to get the latest information from there.
    <br>This is the outside the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.
    <br>People are just coming there.
    <br>They've heard over the past hour, hour and a half that Michael Jackson was rushed to UCLA Medical Center
    <br>and is suffering from cardiac arrest.
    <br>And they're just coming to pay their respects, to pay their tribute.
    <br>The fact that so many of his fans were able to mobilize so quickly
    <br>when this news spread shows that his relevance remains strong after so many years.
    <br>It's very devastating to hear this since he was an icon and he invented the moonwalk,
    <br>he created the moonwalk and I just passed on his dancing and his music to my children,
    <br>my daughter Chloe - his dance, his songs.
    <br>It's just devastating.
    <br>Those crowds getting bigger and bigger as word spreads in Los Angeles, the word spreads
    <br>around the United States, around the world right now that Michael Jackson has died.
    <br>I am just stunned, the atmosphere here is so very bad
    <br>and we are just stunned in the front of the hospital and Michael Jackson's music is being played,
    <br>"Thriller" is being played.
    <br>It is one of the most unbelievable surreal scenes I have ever experienced.
    <br>I can only tell you that this is not something which has been unexpected anytime there was a report
    <br>because of the medications which Michael was under.
    <br>This family has been trying for months and months and months to take care of Michael Jackson -
    <br>the people who have surrounded him, have been enabling him.
    <br>If you think that the case of Anna Nicole Smith was an abuse,
    <br>it is nothing in comparison to what we have seen taking place in Michael Jackson's life.
    <br>And as you can see behind me, there is a huge crowd of international, national and local media
    <br>already camped out outside the hospital and the crowd has been gathering.
    <br>A lot of members of the public are making their way down here.
    <br>What Brian Oxman, the family attorney for the Jacksons, just described is really staggering,
    <br>the news that in his opinion that Michael Jackson may have had issues with prescription drugs.
    <br>People are mourning the King of Pop.
    <br>Why were you dancing in this huge group here?
    <br>In honour of Michael Jackson. I mean he was a legend, an icon.
    <br>And I grew up watching Michael Jackson.
    <br>Michael Jackson was around since before I was even born and I grew up on him
    <br>mimicking his moves and stuff.
    <br>Then since then there's all his videos and everything.
    <br>And as I'm driving down here, I'm on a cross on the parkway, traffic is crazy.
    <br>And I'm just like, "Ah, man, I got to get somewhere!"
    <br>I can't describe what I feel inside.
    <br>He was a legend. He meant so much to everybody, as you see, black, white, green, orange, yellow.
    <br>It's a crushing blown to America or to the world actually.
    <br>Michael Jackson's death comes as huge breaking news internationally.
    <br>These are some of the images we're seeing in different countries from Italy to France to South Korea.
    <br>TV organizations are giving this major event special extended cover.
    <br>Today at work we were talking about what kind of a person he was
    <br>and everyone said that there was only one like him: his appearance, the way he acted.
    <br>Because of that and his songs I think he will be remembered for a long time - forever.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>Let's recall Prophet T.B. Joshua's words:
    <br>I am seeing a great star whom the world are shouting: "Hey, hey, hey!"
    <br>In his own area, he is famous; he is known everywhere.
    <br>Great, too great.
    <br>Michael Jackson, known around the world as the King of Pop, is one of the world's most famous men.
    <br>His highly publicized personal life coupled with his successful career
    <br>made him a part of popular culture for four decades.
    <br>By 1990 Vanity Fair had already cited Michael Jackson
    <br>as the most popular artist in the history of show business.
    <br>Jackson was awarded the White House's Special Artist of the Decade Award by President George HW Bush;
    <br>The World Music Awards - Best Selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium;
    <br>The American Music Awards - Artist of the Century Award;
    <br>The Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award;
    <br>The Living Legend Award at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards;
    <br>the Diamond Award for selling over 100 million albums;
    <br>and was also inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, The Songwriters Hall of Fame
    <br>and twice inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
    <br>His other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records,
    <br>including one for Most Successful Entertainer of All Time
    <br>and one for his support of 39 charities, more than any other entertainer or personality.
    <br>He was also awarded 13 Grammy Awards, 13 Number One Singles in his solo career
    <br>and sold over 750 million records worldwide making him the world's best-selling male solo pop artist.
    <br>Such was the impact of the star's death that many internet sites crashed in the hours
    <br>following the announcements, including the famous social networking site Twitter which was bombarded
    <br>by fans and people who wanted to ascertain the details of his death and post their own tributes.
    <br>The site Wikipedia was also temporarily overloaded and Google News users complained
    <br>that the service was inaccessible for a time.
    <br>At its peak, Google Trends rated the Jackson story as volcanic.
    <br>And AOL said in a statement on June the 25th: "Today was a seminal moment in internet history.
    <br>We've never seen anything like it in terms of scope or depth."
    <br>Michael Jackson's fame and music knew no boundaries.
    <br>He has greatly influenced entertainers from all musical genres and his impact was global.
    <br>Over his lifetime he took super stardom to new heights,
    <br>selling an estimated three-quarters of a billion records worldwide.
    <br>Michael Jackson also transformed the music video into an art form
    <br>through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameo appearances,
    <br>while simultaneously breaking down racial barriers.
    <br>As his friend, actress Elizabeth Taylor once stated, he was the true king of pop, rock and soul.
    <br>Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua had said, in his own area he was the most famous and known throughout the globe
    <br>transcending culture, race, religion and class with his music.
    <br>Truly, he was great, too great.
    <br>In his own area he is famous, known everywhere. Great, too great!
    <br>Because I see something will begin to happen to that star
    <br>that may likely end him to pack his load and go to the journey of no return.
    <br>But I don't know when that journey is.
    <br>Jackson was found in cardiac arrest when paramedics responding to a 911 call
    <br>took him Thursday from his home to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center
    <br>where the music idol was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific Standard Time.
    <br>Throughout recent years Michael Jackson was reportedly plagued by different ailments,
    <br>attending different medical centers for various treatments.
    <br>The possibility that Jackson was also taking medication that could have contributed to his death at age 50
    <br>weighed heavily on people close to the star.
    <br>Dr Deepak Chopra, a physician and lifelong friend of the star, blamed Jackson's death on prescription drug abuse,
    <br>stating that Jackson had told him that he was in a lot of pain.
    <br>Chopra stated: "When you have enough drugs in your system,
    <br>your heart goes into an arrhythmia and your respiration stops. I think the drugs killed him."
    <br>However, the specific cause of Michael Jackson's death has yet to be determined.
    <br>Clearly, as the prophet had said, something had begun to happen to Michael Jackson
    <br>that had eventually led to his unexpected death - a journey of no return.
    <br>When it happens, you'll know something happened.
    <br>He is too young to leave your midst.
    <br>Michael Jackson was only 50 years old when he passed away and was just two weeks away
    <br>from beginning his sell out London tour "This is it".
    <br>The sheer magnitude of the world's response to Jackson's death has been astounding.
    <br>Tributes continue to pour in all over the internet and in cities around the world, as fans young and old alike
    <br>sang and danced to Jackson's greatest hits to remember his incredible career,
    <br>showing that in fact the world was not ready to lose him; he was indeed too young to leave their midst.
    <br>As well as revealing this prophetic message live on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua also gave a personal message of warning to a close friend of the Jackson family,
    <br>Tee-Mac Omatshola Iseli, President of PMAN, the Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria.
    <br>On the 12th of June 2009, just a few weeks ago,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua called Tee-Mac and gave him a personal message to deliver to the Jackson family.
    <br>The Sunday following Jackson's death, the 28th of June 2009, Prophet T.B. Joshua explained the reason
    <br>why he had given this personal message and Tee-Mac himself testified concerning it.
    <br>If you could remember, I said there is a man at the centre of his own world. It's a young man.
    <br>I have the name and everything. I don't want to mention the name.
    <br>I now decided to send for one of my brothers who is very close to the family that has invited the brother here.
    <br>I said, "Please, come. I want to see you, let's see."
    <br>I told him in my office, I said: "Can you go and send for this man for deliverance? I'm seeing so so so..."
    <br>So my brother is here. Please, can you come and share?
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>My name is Tee-Mac, I am a musician, composer and I'm a close friend to the Jackson family.
    <br>Today, the man of God spoke about focus.
    <br>If I had focused on the 12th of June on what he told me, maybe Michael Jackson would still be alive.
    <br>It was his birthday; I came here to celebrate and the man of God asked me up to his office and said to me:
    <br>"Please, tell your friend Marlon to send Michael here to Nigeria.
    <br>Michael needs healing. He needs deliverance."
    <br>I said to the man of God, "But Michael Jackson just went for a check-up
    <br>because he is going to have about 50 concerts."
    <br>When I got a phone call from the Chairman of the Black American Mayors,
    <br>he said they just brought Michael Jackson to the hospital, he is unconscious.
    <br>I quickly put CNN on and immediately it came to my head:
    <br>"But the man of God told me something is going to happen."
    <br>If I had focused more, we would have insisted, "Michael come here you need healing",
    <br>he would still be alive.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>If I know you and I know whom I can quickly send to you, I don't need to mention the name.
    <br>But if I know there's no way I can reach, let me mention it
    <br>so that anybody who knows him can contact him.
    <br>Because it's a sin to me if I don't do it.
    <br>So the first thing, I will just have to say it so that when I'm saying it,
    <br>the person as well may be watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>and people who know him also may be watching.
    <br>So I have to say it.
    <br>Later that same Sunday, the 28th of June 2009, we caught up with PMAN President,
    <br>Tee-Mac Omatshola Iseli, to hear more  from him.
    <br>Let us watch the interview.
    <br>God Is Still Saying Something
    <br>Thank you for joining us.
    <br>Today we have the wonderful privilege to speak to Tee-Mac.
    <br>Tee-Mac is a philharmonic composer and professional flautist and also the President of PMAN here in Nigeria.
    <br>We want to speak to him today concerning the recent events that have taken place
    <br>which have shocked the world - the death of Michael Jackson
    <br>and also concerning the prophetic message that he heard concerning these events.
    <br>Sir, you're very welcome.
    <br>Thank you very much for inviting me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Thank you for your time, sir.
    <br>First of all, we want to offer you our condolences concerning the death of Michael Jackson.
    <br>We know he was a friend and also it's a great loss to the music industry and to the world as a whole.
    <br>We want to ask you first of all, sir. Can you explain to us your relationship to the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>How do you know the prophet?
    <br>We have known each other for actually many years.
    <br>Number one, the prophet loves music.
    <br>When you listen to his choir and his band, this is one of the best bands in Africa here on stage.
    <br>He loves my flute. I admire him, what he does; I have always had a big admiration for people who give.
    <br>I find it extraordinary - the powers he has, the way he can heal people, the way he influences people's life.
    <br>Somehow, I do understand on what level that energy comes from.
    <br>Of course, the man of God being a Christian states that the energy comes from Jesus.
    <br>I have a big admiration for the giving power, how the man of God gives to the poor,
    <br>how he lives a simple life and that's very impressive to me.
    <br>Concerning your relationship with the prophet - how long have you known him?
    <br>Maybe it's 15 years or 18 years - I don't remember.
    <br>It's hard for me to say because I think we had an admiration for each other since the beginning.
    <br>He's sincere in what he is doing and I think he knows that I'm sincere in what I'm doing musically.
    <br>There's attraction to each other.
    <br>Concerning the prophecy, can you tell us what exactly did the man of God tell you about Michael Jackson
    <br>and how the whole thing came about, how he called you?
    <br>It is amazing. I never discussed with the man of God Michael Jackson. Never.
    <br>June the 12th, I came to his birthday party, I came to play 'Happy Birthday' on the flute for the man of God
    <br>and then I was called up to his office and man of God said to me:
    <br>"Tee-Mac, you must tell your friend Marlon that Michael must come to Nigeria.
    <br>He must come for deliverance and healing, he's very sick."
    <br>I said to the man of God: "But Michael just had a medical test.
    <br>He's doing 50 concerts. Before the insurance company would underwrite, he had to go for medical.
    <br>As far as I know, he's in good health."
    <br>The man of God said: "No, he's not in good health, he has to come. There's a serious problem with Michael."
    <br>So what was your reaction, when you heard?
    <br>My reaction was - I didn't doubt him at all but I was a bit surprised. I said, "Okay, I will try".
    <br>Because it's not easy to get Michael now to Nigeria while he's rehearsing for his fifty concerts.
    <br>But since he's coming in August anyhow to do the foundation stone laying for the motherland project
    <br>and in October the Jacksons should have had a reunion concert in Nigeria.
    <br>They decided it's gonna be in Nigeria.
    <br>We already looked at venues, I went with Marlon to look at the stadium in Abuja.
    <br>Everything was planned for the big concert.
    <br>So I said, okay, I will talk to Marlon. I couldn't get Marlon that night.
    <br>The following day, I said to Marlon, "You know, I mentioned to you that we are going to The Synagogue
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua said that Michael should come urgently for healing."
    <br>Then Marlon said: "You know, Tee-Mac, it's not possible at the moment, he has a very tight schedule.
    <br>The first concert is July 3, they moved it forward from July 8.
    <br>But what we can do is between the 50 concerts, there will be a break.
    <br>Maybe we can bring him down to Nigeria because you are so convinced that it will help him.
    <br>Anything which can help my brother, I agree."
    <br>I then travelled to Port Harcourt. I came back on Thursday. I was very tired and I lied on my bed.
    <br>At about 8:15 I got a phone call from the United States
    <br>saying that Michael Jackson has just been brought to the hospital unconscious.
    <br>Immediately came the flashback here - but that's what the man of God was saying, that he has a problem.
    <br>I was just praying that it's not serious; I put on CNN and then it unfolded
    <br>and the confirmation came that Michael Jackson passed away.
    <br>Well, what can we say? The man of God has seen it
    <br>and I am sure that the man of God could not have told me in advance
    <br>that he will actually pass away, that a famous, one of the top musicians, will die and pass away.
    <br>When he spoke to me, he spoke to me like with an emergency:
    <br>"Let him come for treatment, let him come for deliverance. He needs it urgently."
    <br>And I may have not have focused enough in taking it so seriously
    <br>to make Marlon understand that this is a matter of life and death.
    <br>Because I didn't think it was a matter of life and death. But now I know better.
    <br>I'm seeing a great star whom the world are shouting, "Hey,hey, hey!"
    <br>In his own area he is famous, he is known everywhere, great. Too great!
    <br>Because I see something will begin to happen to that star
    <br>and that may likely end in him to pack his load and go to the journey of no return.
    <br>But I don't know when that journey is.
    <br>Can I ask you what goes through your mind now after losing a close friend like Michael Jackson,
    <br>at the same time having heard the warning?
    <br>You've seen how God is using the prophet in the area of prophecy. How do you feel?
    <br>I feel disturbed and I must say the day when I heard that Michael passed away, I was very disturbed.
    <br>I tried to call the man of God, I called a couple of times in the evening.
    <br>He called me back and said: "Tee-Mac, I told you."
    <br>I said: "Yes, I will have to come and see you. I must make a testimony,
    <br>I must tell the whole world that you had seen it."
    <br>I mean I had no doubt that the man of God is a true prophet.
    <br>But that he can see things so precisely is still an amazing thing to me.
    <br>That he gave me that warning in advance and I was not able to convince Marlon enough
    <br>because we all believed he was in good health.
    <br>I mean he did a medical, he was preparing for 50 shows.
    <br>How can I convince somebody - everybody said he is in good health - that he's in serious danger.
    <br>His schedule was also so that: "Oh dear, we will come but not at the moment."
    <br>So I guess it was the will of God.
    <br>What can you say just generally about this prophetic gift which God has given Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>It is not only this event, there are so many world events that have taken place
    <br>which he has foreseen and publicly said, given warnings to the world to take note.
    <br>And what can you say about this gift?
    <br>It's amazing because there was another event which was earth-shaking.
    <br>I was a very close friend to Abiola.
    <br>Abiola was a ju-ju musician who as a musician saved money to become an accountant
    <br>and in 1970 I had a small nightclub on Broad Street and Abiola was an accountant two houses further in ITT.
    <br>He used to come and eat lunch in my nightclub every lunchtime.
    <br>And we were very close. He helped the Musicians Union, which I co-founded 26 years ago.
    <br>And when the man of God told Abiola that he will win the election but he will never be the president of Nigeria,
    <br>at that time not headline news but we all knew about the prophecy that the man of God told Abiola:
    <br>"You will win the election but you will not become the president of Nigeria."
    <br>You know, on the birthday of the man of God the election was cancelled, which was June the 12th.
    <br>The man of God, within 10 minutes of the meeting, told Abiola that he would win the election
    <br>but he was never going to be the president of Nigeria.
    <br>Immediately, the chief called me aside and told me that the prophet was not an ordinary man.
    <br>Many of those events I see the man of God predicting show that he is a very special human being
    <br>in direct contact with God and the powers of God.

    <br>Provide the solution, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I'm looking at the signature.
    <br>It's the kind of signature for somebody to sign and say: "Hey, I am resigning."
    <br>What is the meaning of that?
    <br>So let us pray.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>I will not say more than that.
    <br>On Monday, the 18th of August 2008,
    <br>President Pervez Musharraf announced his resignation as the president of the nation Pakistan.
    <br>Let's watch the report.
    <br>We begin with an important moment for the people of Pakistan.
    <br>The President Pervez Musharraf has announced his resignation.
    <br>It's a move that gives his many critics just what they've been looking for
    <br>and it saves the US-backed former general from almost certain impeachment.
    <br>Our Reza Sayah is in Islamabad and he has been following developments from the Pakistani capital.
    <br>The political career of President Pervez Musharraf who announced his resignation this afternoon in Islamabad
    <br>about 1:00 pm local time, about three hours ago.
    <br>But a dramatic set of developments today and a lot of suspense because nobody was quite sure
    <br>what the president's decision was going to be.
    <br>Let's set the stage: This morning his spokesman announced that he would address the nation
    <br>with a televised speech at 1:00 pm.
    <br>And then came the rumours and conflicting reports.
    <br>Some said that he was going to resign and some of his allies said no, he plans to face the impeachment charges.
    <br>And when his speech began, he kept the nation in suspense
    <br>because it wasn't until 45 minutes into his 1-hour speech that he actually revealed his plans to resign.
    <br>And let's go ahead and take you through what was a very dramatic and sometimes emotional speech.
    <br>He opened up by saying it's a tough day of decisions today.
    <br>Then he outlined some of his accomplishments.
    <br>Then he questioned why the coalition partners would want to impeach him.
    <br>There, you got the sense that perhaps he wasn't going to resign and then again 45 minutes into his speech
    <br>there was a distinct shift in tone.
    <br>He said that he loves his country and he will always love his country
    <br>and he's conferred with some of his political allies.
    <br>And he said for the sake of Pakistan and for the sake of ending the confrontation he's decided to resign.
    <br>Here's how he announced the decision.
    <br>Now I have decided I will resign from the post of President
    <br>and I would be sending my resignation to the Speaker of the Parliament.
    <br>A farewell ceremony at the President's house.
    <br>Musharraf presented with the honour guard and salutes from military colleagues,
    <br>not the way he wanted to go out, say analysts.
    <br>The resignation of Pakistan President Musharraf confirms the words of prophecy from Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>which said: "I'm looking at the signature, a kind of signature for somebody to sign
    <br>and say: "Hey, I'm resigning."
    <br>Take note of the way Prophet T.B. Joshua demonstrated the signing of a signature as he said this.
    <br>This is exactly the way one would sign their signature.
    <br>The resignation of President Musharraf who seized power nine years ago
    <br>came after weeks of pressure and tension for him to relinquish power
    <br>at a time when Pakistan is facing critical challenges,
    <br>such as a sinking economy and an emboldened militant movement.
    <br>Speaking about his decision to resign, Musharraf said:
    <br>"The Coalition has decided that I am part of the problem and not the solution."
    <br>His words precisely reflect the Prophet's words: "Where there is pressure and tension, You are the solution,
    <br>provide the solution, Lord."
    <br>Where there is pressure and tension, You are the solution.
    <br>Provide the solution, Lord.
    <br>On the 18th of May 2008, God Almighty opened our eyes to another future event
    <br>through a prophetic message given by the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>during the live Sunday service at The Synagogue, Church of All Nations.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua said that he saw a vision in which the name of a company flashed.
    <br>He saw a tragedy that would happen that would affect a company of that name.
    <br>He saw the second part of the name, but as he said he did not see the name clearly.
    <br>Let us watch and see how he pronounced it.
    <br>I was in a vision, I saw something which I want to share with you.
    <br>We pray and ask God.
    <br>So this is two, three times.
    <br>The name flashed in that vision.
    <br>VERSAL - that is the last name.
    <br>But the first name, the beginning of the name was not clear to me.
    <br>VERSAL.
    <br>Well, I don't know the company and I don't know...
    <br>But - VERSAL...
    <br>So we pray for a company whatever company it is.
    <br>It's a tragedy that will happen that will affect the company of that kind of name
    <br>but in a northern part of a country.
    <br>It's a big country, if not one of the biggest countries.
    <br>So we lift our voice with faith in our heart and pray that Lord Jesus, cover them with Your precious blood.
    <br>Lord Jesus,
    <br>protect them, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>The following week during the live Sunday service on the 25th of May 2008,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua reminded the congregation of the prophecy.
    <br>Let's listen.
    <br>Remember the message given last Sunday concerning a place called VERSAL.
    <br>I mentioned this and I repeat it again.
    <br>So, please take note of that, put it in prayer and pray for the nation.
    <br>Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua had prophesied, a blaze broke out at Universal Studios, Hollywood,
    <br>California in North America on Sunday, the 1st of June 2008.
    <br>Note that the second part of the name Universal - it is precisely as Prophet T.B. Joshua revealed it.
    <br>The incident occurred just before dawn at 4:45 am American Pacific Standard Time
    <br>on a sound stage on the company's 400 acre property.
    <br>Let's watch the report.
    <br>Breaking News
    <br>Fire at the Universal Studios lot near Los Angeles destroyed movie sets and a video vault
    <br>containing more than 13,000 videos and film reels.
    <br>The Universal says nothing irreplaceable was lost.
    <br>No Hollywood happy ending, but it could have been a lot worse.
    <br>These impressive pyrotechnics, and no movie shoot, it was real life.
    <br>A fast-moving fire tore through Universal Studios and theme park near Los Angeles on Sunday.
    <br>CNN's Thelma Gutierrez has this report.
    <br>It was a very stubborn fire that took more than 14 hours to put out
    <br>but not before ten fire-fighters sustained minor injuries
    <br>and a good portion of a Hollywood landmark was reduced to ashes.
    <br>Shortly before dawn, a spectacular fire lights up the sky above Universal Studios, Hollywood.
    <br>It was nasty, very nasty.
    <br>John Hartman awakens to several explosions and grabs his camera.
    <br>It was the sound of automobile tyres exploding on trucks.
    <br>Whatever it was, it was loud.
    <br>A dark plume of smoke shoots hundreds of feet into the air as flames raced through the back lot of Universal,
    <br>consuming famous city facades on New York Street and the Courthouse Square
    <br>we remember from "Back to the Future".
    <br>This is what happened to the King Kong attraction, part of the tram ride at Universal, completely destroyed.
    <br>We had essentially two city blocks on fire at the same time.
    <br>400 fire-fighters attacked the flames from the ground from rooftops and ladders
    <br>trying to keep the fire from spreading through the park.
    <br>They were flowing in excess of 18,000 gallons of water per minute.
    <br>Fire-fighters and studio employees carried boxes of recordings to safety before the video vault burned out -
    <br>a huge relief for Universal President Ron Meyers
    <br>because the main vault of the motion picture negatives was not affected.
    <br>Fortunately nothing irreplaceable was lost, we have duplicates
    <br>and obviously, there's a lot of work to replicate what's been lost, but it can be done.
    <br>How it started is still a mystery
    <br>but the before it was over arson investigators began to sift through the damage.
    <br>As for the thousands of tourists who came to visit, the gates remain closed
    <br>as clouds of smoke billow into the air.
    <br>Universal Studios and CityWalk will be open for business later today.
    <br>Thelma Gutierrez, CNN, Universal City, California.
    <br>What we have just seen is a confirmation of the prophet's words
    <br>that he saw a company bearing 'versal' as the second part of the name in one of the world's biggest countries.
    <br>It is reported that more than 516 Los Angeles area fire-fighters battled the fire in a back lot
    <br>of Universal Studios which is adjacent to the Universal Studios theme park.
    <br>There were reports of an explosion shortly after the fire broke out.
    <br>The whole world watched as the famous Motion Picture Company was being consumed by flames.
    <br>Universal Studios Hollywood is a unit of Universal Parks and Resorts,
    <br>a division of Universal Studios, a part of NBC Universal.
    <br>NBC Universal is one of the world's leading media and entertainment companies in the development,
    <br>production, marketing of entertainment news and information to a global audience.
    <br>During the live Sunday service as the incident was happening,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua called the congregation and viewers to join together and pray in one accord,
    <br>as the tragedy that had been revealed was taking place.
    <br>Let's watch.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Two weeks ago, I gave you one name of a company.
    <br>And I was saying, VERSAL.
    <br>I said, the name, I could not see it clear.
    <br>We want to pray for this country - there is fire in one of the biggest companies in the United States.
    <br>But with the prayer you want to offer now, I know the prayer will touch the company.
    <br>Prayer! Lift up your voice.
    <br>Father, we stretch our right hand.
    <br>Anywhere the company is right now as the fire is burning, Lord Jesus...
    <br>We remember Meshach, Shadrach, Abednego.
    <br>The same God is alive today.
    <br>They were walking in the fire, You turned the fire to water.
    <br>Father, begin to turn the fire to water.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Million people working. Where do you want them to go? Where would they work to feed their families?
    <br>Our prayer warriors will continue, since the fire is still on.
    <br>We know what our God can do.
    <br>It will not go beyond what they are seeing now.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>God is God of the Universe and as it says in the Book of Jeremiah 23:24 we are always under His eyes - always.
    <br>We thank God for the prophecy and for God's protecting hand in the situation.
    <br>As the prophet said, the prayer offered by the congregation and viewers will touch the company.
    <br>With the prayer you want to offer and I know the prayer will touch the company.
    <br>Prayer! Lift up your voice!
    <br>Of those involved, 14 fire-fighters and three deputies sustained minor injuries and no lives were lost.
    <br>On Sunday, the 5th of October 2008 during the first service at The Synagogue, Church of All Nations,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua delivered a prophetic message concerning a leader of an Asian country.
    <br>Let's listen to what he said.
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray!
    <br>So let us come together and pray on Tuesday to save this life.
    <br>Hero - let's come together and pray and fast on Tuesday.
    <br>So, that Tuesday, for victory over death.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>It's somebody, when it happens, you know, everybody knows.
    <br>But let us come together on Tuesday. Take your time, please.
    <br>So, save this soul.
    <br>Come together and pray.
    <br>On Tuesday, fast as the Spirit directs and let us pray together all over the world.
    <br>This is an Asian country.
    <br>He is a new person; he is very new.
    <br>Why all this again?
    <br>The prophet further explained his vision during the second service on that same day.
    <br>Let's listen to what he said.
    <br>Remember the prayer I asked you to offer for a particular nation, an Asian country, on Tuesday.
    <br>It has become a common event, and this time around it is a person they want to target.
    <br>The plan of evil, they have set it.
    <br>I'm looking at it in a vision.
    <br>Just to get the very person concerned.
    <br>You'll just learn that they have killed somebody.
    <br>But why the same?
    <br>I don't want to say more than that.
    <br>But me, I will fast and pray.
    <br>The very next Tuesday, the 7th of October 2008 a riot broke out at the Parliament House in Thailand,
    <br>one of the Asian countries,
    <br>as protesters seeking to topple Thailand's government and their newly elected prime minister
    <br>Somchai Wong-sawat clashed with police.
    <br>Let's watch the report.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>Military troops are on the streets of Bangkok
    <br>as Thailand's political troubles descended into violent clashes on Tuesday.
    <br>It happened at the very gates of the country's parliament
    <br>as protesters battled with police and two people were killed.
    <br>CNN's Dan Rivers is in Bangkok.
    <br>Once again, the streets of Bangkok reverberate to the sound of a riot.
    <br>The police struggling to move anti-government protesters who'd built barricades surrounding parliament.
    <br>A fog of tear-gas and protesters run for cover.
    <br>This is supposed to be the day the Prime Minister tells the people about his policies
    <br>but amid all this few were listening.
    <br>All day the violence continued.
    <br>We arrived at police headquarters as another clash was breaking out.
    <br>The administrative heart of the city had been filled with chaos.
    <br>And it was the police who seemed on the back foot here,
    <br>apparently under orders not to inflame the situation further.
    <br>More than 100 people were injured, several seriously, hundreds more suffering the effects of tear-gas.
    <br>At one point the protesters retaliated by spreading stinking sewage in front of the police base.
    <br>In the end helicopters were sent to evacuate the Prime Minister, his car unable to leave Parliament.
    <br>Well, the police are doing their best to push back the crowds from their headquarters here.
    <br>They're firing tear-gas and it sounds like stun grenades or something.
    <br>We know already several policemen have been injured,
    <br>the police themselves say they've been shot by the protesters.
    <br>Dan Rivers, CNN. Thank you.
    <br>The protests are the latest front in what is a four-month campaign by the People's Alliance for Democracy.
    <br>Thailand's political turmoil began in late May when the PAD trying to unseat the Thai government accusing it
    <br>of ties to the former leader Thaksin Shinawatra.
    <br>Then, on August 26th protesters stormed Bangkok's main government compound.
    <br>They've been encamped there ever since,
    <br>originally planning to stay until the former Prime Minister was ousted from office.
    <br>That happened in September but the protests still go on.
    <br>PAD says that the former Prime Minister's successor is unacceptable
    <br>because he is the brother-in-law of Thaksin Shinawatra.
    <br>Incredibly, the prophet specifically mentioned Tuesday
    <br>as the day to pray to save this life, the very day the incident took place.
    <br>The Tuesday riot is reported to be the worst street violence in Thailand in the last 16 years.
    <br>Hundreds were injured and two were killed during the attempt to prevent Somchai Wong-sawat
    <br>from entering the parliament building.
    <br>But miraculously, the Prime Minister's life was saved.
    <br>It's somebody, when it happens, you know, everybody knows.
    <br>The prophet expressed that what was going to happen would be well known
    <br>and true to this statement, reports were carried across the globe by international media.
    <br>This is an Asian country.
    <br>This is a new person. He is a new person, very new.
    <br>Why all this again?
    <br>In confirmation of the prophet's words that this is an Asian country and this is a new person, very new,
    <br>Somchai Wong-sawat was elected Prime Minister of Thailand, an Asian country
    <br>on the 17th of September 2008 - just 18 days before the prophecy was given
    <br>during the live Sunday service at The Synagogue, Church of All Nations.
    <br>It has become a common event
    <br>and this time around, it is a person they want to target.
    <br>The plan of evil, they have set it. I'm looking at it in a vision.
    <br>Just to get the very person concerned.
    <br>The protests in Thailand have been occurring since the 25th of May 2008
    <br>confirming what the prophet had said that this had become a common event.
    <br>The man of God said that this time around it is a person that they want to target
    <br>and that the plan of evil has been set.
    <br>Since August the 26th 2008, even before Somchai Wong-sawat's appointment to office as Prime Minister,
    <br>the PAD, the People's Alliance for Democracy and its supporters had laid siege to the government house
    <br>saying they would not leave until the People's Power party allies were ousted from office.
    <br>This attempt was aimed specifically at the current Prime Minister Somchai Wong-sawat,
    <br>a member of the People's Power party.
    <br>On Sunday, the 18th of January 2009 during the live service at The Synagogue, Church of All Nations
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic revelation concerning a nation
    <br>where NY was a part of that country and a call to pray on the day of Friday.
    <br>Let's listen to what he said.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>Fast on Friday.
    <br>I see a nation, N.Y.
    <br>Open your lips and pray for a nation, N.Y.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>A country that N.Y. is part of that country.
    <br>What I saw in a vision is what I'm telling you, the way I see it is the way I'm presenting it.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the second live service that same Sunday the man of God gave a call to pray and fast
    <br>on the 13th of the month of February.
    <br>February 13,
    <br>we should pray for the whole world.
    <br>The Lord showed me the country, but February 13 I'm seeing like that...
    <br>If the Lord will change it.
    <br>If it's not changeable, I will speak out.
    <br>Remember the man of God's words, February 13, we should pray for the whole world.
    <br>On Friday, the 13th of February 2009 a succession of events occurring in different parts of the globe
    <br>hit the headlines of international media.
    <br>In the early hours of Friday morning a Continental Airlines plane
    <br>crashed into a home near Buffalo, New York at 3:20 am GMT, Friday, February the 13th 2009
    <br>killing all 49 passengers on board and one person on the ground.
    <br>Let's watch the report.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>We're just gonna go to some breaking news that's come to us,
    <br>we believe that a plane has crashed into a house in Clarence, Buffalo, New York.
    <br>It's a large commercial airliner with 50 to 60 seats.
    <br>And it's crashed into a house on Long Street, west of Goodrich.
    <br>We are told everyone who was in the house got out safely, but that house is engulfed in flames.
    <br>Fire crews have obviously arrived at the scene.
    <br>There is no word on the fate of the pilot of the plane or anyone else who may have been on board.
    <br>But as we just reported, that plane did have 50 to 60 seats.
    <br>Just repeating that the plane has crashed into a house in Clarence, Buffalo, New York.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>All levels from the local right on to federal operations are represented here doing their jobs.
    <br>That's all the questions we're going to take right now.
    <br>We will have more for you in a couple of hours, let's say, at 4 o'clock.
    <br>We've just been listening to a news conference there of emergency authorities.
    <br>We can confirm that Continental Flight 3407 from Newark to Buffalo
    <br>crashed into a home in Clarence Center, a suburb of Buffalo, New York.
    <br>The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed that 48 people were on that plane.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>49 deaths are confirmed from last night's commuter plane crash in the US state of New York.
    <br>Continental Airlines Express flight 3407
    <br>was only around 10 kilometres away from its planned airport
    <br>landing in the city of Buffalo when it crashed into a house in the town of Clarence.
    <br>All 48 people aboard the aircraft were killed as was one person on the ground.
    <br>Two others on the ground were treated for injuries.
    <br>The Continental flight had taken off from Newark in New Jersey.
    <br>It's unclear whether a mix of sleet and snow in the Buffalo area played any role in that crash.
    <br>The commuter plane was a 74 seat Bombardier Dash, a turboprop operated by Colgan Air of Virginia.
    <br>CNN has listened to a tape recording of communications
    <br>between the flight crew and air traffic control.
    <br>There seems to be no sound of distress in those communications,
    <br>but a minute after the late communication heard from the pilot
    <br>the controller is heard trying to contact the plane and was getting no response.
    <br>After pause he tries to contact the plane again, when the controller asked the pilot
    <br>of a nearby Delta Airlines plane to see if he can spot the Continental flight.
    <br>Colgan 34-7, approach.
    <br>Colgan 3407, Buffalo.
    <br>Colgan 34-7, now approach.
    <br>Delta 1988, look off your right side about five miles for a Dash 8, should be 43 hundred, you see anything there?
    <br>Uh negative Delta 1998, we're just in the bottoms and nothing off TKs.
    <br>Colgan 3407, Buffalo.
    <br>Colgan 3407, Buffalo Tower, how do you hear?
    <br>This is ground communication, we need to talk to somebody at least five miles northeast,
    <br>okay, possibly Clarence, that area right in there, Akron area, either state police or sheriff's department,
    <br>we need to find if anything is on the ground.
    <br>This aircraft was five miles out and all of a sudden we have no response on that aircraft.
    <br>All I can tell you is the aircraft's over the marker, and we are not talking to them now.
    <br>Let me get back to you, sir, but apparently we have an emergency, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
    <br>Ok, for all aircraft this frequency, we did have a Dash eight over the marker that didn't make the airport.
    <br>It appears to be about 5 miles away from the airport - there, Delta 1998 I'm going to bring you in sir, on the approach.
    <br>If you could just give me a (unintelligible) when you get to 23 hundred,
    <br>and if you have any problem with the localizer or anything, let me know.
    <br>However, we're showing it all in the green here.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Cactus, did you find Colgan?
    <br>Unfortunately they said he went down about, right over the marker (unintelligible).
    <br>Tower, Cactus 1452's coming up on the clock and we saw the ground, you guys know what's going on?
    <br>Cactus 1452, Buffalo Tower (unintelligible) two three to clear landing, yes sir, we are aware.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Just a short time ago emergency responders along with an array of officials
    <br>held a news conference on the crash.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>The news headline clearly bore the letters N.Y., just as Prophet T.B. Joshua had said.
    <br>Open your lips and pray for a nation, N.Y., a country that N.Y. is part of that country.
    <br>Continental Connection Flight 3407
    <br>operated by Colgan Air was on route from Newark, New Jersey when it went down,
    <br>said Bill Pit with New York State Emergency Management in Albany.
    <br>The crash occurred about seven miles from Buffalo Niagara International Airport
    <br>in the state of New York, USA.
    <br>The date and day of the crash is in complete accordance with both the prophetic revelations
    <br>given by the man of God in the first live service where he gave the call to pray on Friday.
    <br>Fast on Friday.
    <br>I see a nation N.Y.
    <br>And the second live service where he specifically mentioned the 13th of February.
    <br>February 13 we should pray for the whole world.
    <br>Later that same Friday, the 13th of February 2009, a further plane crash occurred, this time in London, UK
    <br>when British Airways Flight 8456 from Amsterdam crash landed at London City Airport.
    <br>Let's watch the report.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>According to eyewitnesses, the front wheels by the aircraft's nose collapsed
    <br>when the plane made a hard landing.
    <br>The aircraft skidded to a halt on the runway and it's 67 passengers and 5 crew were evacuated
    <br>using the plane's emergency chutes.
    <br>In response to the incident, the airport has been closed and flights were diverted to other airports.
    <br>We thank God that no one lost their life.
    <br>On Sunday, the 8th of February 2009 during the live Sunday service Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>gave a prophetic revelation about what he had been shown
    <br>regarding an event that was to occur in an Asian nation.
    <br>Let's listen to what he said.
    <br>The Asian country - very close to the border.
    <br>I'm given the name of the country, but let me put it, Asian country.
    <br>I'm seeing train which carries a lot of people - go astray.
    <br>That is, run out of the rail.
    <br>So, please open your lips, ask for their protection. Prayer.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>Ask God's favour to speak for them, mercy to speak for them.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>In exact confirmation of the prophet's words,
    <br>on Friday, the 13th of February, only 5 days after the prophetic message was given,
    <br>a train derailed in Eastern India killing at least 14 passengers and injuring more than 100.
    <br>Let us watch the report.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>At least 15 people are known to have been killed when a passenger train crashed in India.
    <br>The express was traveling between Kolkata and Chennai when it came off the rails.
    <br>Emma North reports.
    <br>This was a Coromandel express train known as the daily super fast service;
    <br>now rescuers cut through crushed metal trying to find anyone trapped.
    <br>At least 16 carriages were derailed in the darkness and travellers were unable to help their fellow passengers.
    <br>The train started vibrating. When I woke up, we could not make out what happened.
    <br>People helped us get out.
    <br>One man's fingers were chopped off and his head was badly smashed.
    <br>We saw a body of a man who died as he was buried under the seat.
    <br>We couldn't save him.
    <br>Most of them were really helpful. We are really thankful and grateful to the local people.
    <br>So it is a second life for me.
    <br>The train had left Kolkata, Eastern India's biggest city, heading for Chennai with around 1,500 people on board.
    <br>It came off the tracks at speed, near a remote station in the eastern state of Orissa;
    <br>dozens were injured, the death toll expected to rise.
    <br>About 50 to 60 people have been injured.
    <br>One coach got on top of another and according to unconfirmed reports,
    <br>about 15 bodies have been taken out.
    <br>Rescue operations are going on.
    <br>India's rail system is one of the world's largest with an estimated eighteen and a half million users every day
    <br>and more than 300 accidents each year.
    <br>An inquiry into this particular crash has been ordered.
    <br>Emma North, BBC News.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>At least a dozen people are dead and scores injured after a passenger train derailed in Eastern India.
    <br>Officials fear more victims are trapped in the wreckage.
    <br>The train was traveling from West Bengal to Tamil Nadu when it jumped the tracks.
    <br>The train going from Howrah in West Bengal state to Chennai in Tamil Nadu in the South of the country
    <br>jumped the tracks midway, according to a spokesman for India's East Coast Railway.
    <br>It was reported that as many as 14 carriages of the super fast express train Coromandel Express
    <br>came off the track.
    <br>This tragic incident saw 14 people killed and more than 100 injured.
    <br>The location and details of the disaster directly confirmed the prophecy of the man of God.
    <br>The Asian country, very close to the border.
    <br>I'm given the name of the country, but let me put it, Asian country.
    <br>Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua had said, the derailment happened in the Asian nation of India,
    <br>as the Coromandel Express was travelling along the east coast of India from Howrah to Chennai,
    <br>very close to the country's border.
    <br>I'm seeing a train which carries a lot of people - go astray.
    <br>That is, run out of the rail.
    <br>In further confirmation, the train was heavily loaded with passengers, 1500 in total,
    <br>when 14 coaches came off the rails, just as the prophet had specified.
    <br>On Sunday, the 26th of April 2009, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message
    <br>concerning the death of somebody that affects the whole world.
    <br>Let's watch the prophecy.
    <br>On Saturday, somebody is being rushed to the hospital.
    <br>But from that hospital, he could not come back home.
    <br>What we are saying here, it's all over the world we are talking to.
    <br>And people that affect the world - shake the whole world.
    <br>People that matter.
    <br>When it happens, you say: "Ahh!"
    <br>In direct confirmation of Prophet T.B. Joshua's message on Saturday, the 23rd of May 2009,
    <br>former South Korean President, Roh Moo-hyun was rushed to the hospital and declared dead.
    <br>Let us watch the breaking news.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>I'm Laritsa Vassileva, the CNNCenter, with more on breaking news out of South Korea.
    <br>Police there saying that former President Roh Moo-hyun has died.
    <br>Yonhap news agency says he apparently died from a fall while hiking.
    <br>It's unclear though, if it was an accident, or if he tried to commit suicide.
    <br>Roh served as South Korean President from 2003 to 2008;
    <br>he had been under investigation in a bribery scandal.
    <br>There were allegations that Roh took millions of dollars from a businessman while in office.
    <br>Media reports say Roh suffered head injuries and died after being taken to a hospital.
    <br>He was 62 years old.
    <br>The news of the late President's apparent suicide sent the nation into shock.
    <br>Current President Lee Myung-bak released a statement saying it was sad and tragic.
    <br>Let us recall the words of Prophet T.B. Joshua concerning this tragic death.
    <br>On Saturday somebody is being rushed to the hospital
    <br>but from from that hospital he could not come back home.
    <br>What we are saying here, it's all over the world we are talking to.
    <br>And people that affect the world - shake the whole world.
    <br>People that matter.
    <br>When it happens, you say: "Ahh!"
    <br>Notice that Prophet T.B. Joshua mentioned the exact day the event would happen, Saturday.
    <br>And in the early hours of Saturday morning, the 23rd of May 2009,
    <br>former South Korean President, Roh Moo-hyun was rushed to a hospital
    <br>after jumping from a hill behind his house.
    <br>Moon Jae-in who served as Roh's presidential chief of staff stated:
    <br>"Roh appeared to have jumped off a mountain around 6:40 am."
    <br>Late President Roh Moo-hyun took the country by storm riding high on the nation's desire for a clean politician
    <br>that could bring about change.
    <br>But the dramatic support and the ensuing disappointment may have led to his ultimate downfall.
    <br>His former chief of staff told reporters that Roh is believed to have jumped off a cliff
    <br>behind his home in Southern Korea early Saturday morning, leaving behind a suicide note.
    <br>Unconscious with a head injury, he was rushed to hospital in Gimhae, just as the prophet had said.
    <br>On Saturday somebody is rushed to the hospital.
    <br>But from that hospital, he could not come back home.
    <br>South Korea is reacting with disbelief to the death of Roh Moo-hyun, the former President
    <br>who was under a cloud of suspicion.
    <br>No supporters are mourning the once popular leader.
    <br>The government says he leaped to his death from a cliff near his home
    <br>and prosecutors say they're suspending the multimillion-dollar corruption case against him.
    <br>Doctors described Roh's injuries at the nearby hospital where he died.
    <br>When he came into the hospital, the electrocardiogram monitoring showed no sign of pulse beat.
    <br>A laceration measuring 11 centimetres was found on the front part of his head.
    <br>Doctors in this hospital attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation
    <br>but suspended it at 8:30 am as he failed to recover.
    <br>From the hospital in Gimhae, the former President was sent to Busan University Hospital in Yang San
    <br>where doctors report that they were unable to resuscitate him, that is bring him back to life.
    <br>And the family mourned his death, for from the hospital he could not come back home,
    <br>exactly as Prophet T.B. Joshua had prophesied.
    <br>Former South Korean President, Roh Moo-hyun was pronounced dead around 9:30 am.
    <br>Head trauma was identified as the main cause of his death.
    <br>What we are saying here, it's all over the world we are talking to.
    <br>And people that affect the world - shake the whole world.
    <br>People that matter.
    <br>When it happens you say: "Ahh!"
    <br>Roh, who served as President from 2003 to 2008, was no stranger to a good fight.
    <br>He was a flamboyant human rights lawyer who caught the nation's attention
    <br>by representing labour unions when the country was under a military dictatorship.
    <br>In the 2002 presidential race he was able to mobilize an army
    <br>of young and internet-savvy supporters to win a surprise victory.
    <br>Roh Moo-hyun was the 16th president of South Korea serving in office
    <br>between February 25th 2003 and February 25th 2008.
    <br>He's the immediate past President of South Korea.
    <br>As a former world leader, he held a position that affected the entire international community.
    <br>The tragic nature of his death has shocked the nation of South Korea and the entire world.
    <br>On Saturday somebody is being rushed to the hospital
    <br>but from that hospital he could not come back home.
    <br>What we are saying here, it's all over the world we are talking to.
    <br>And people that affect the world - shake the whole world.
    <br>People that matter.
    <br>When it happens you say: "Ahh!"
    <br>When it happens you say: "Ahh!"
    <br>This is an exclamation of shock.
    <br>Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua had prophesied,
    <br>news of the former South Korean President's death was met with shock all around the world.
    <br>South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said this is a truly unbelievable, lamentable and deeply sad event.
    <br>A shocked President Lee Myung-bak went ahead with a summit with the European Union
    <br>but cancelled engagements for the rest of the day.
    <br>He described the death as a national tragedy, police spokesman said.
    <br>When you look at history, there were true prophets and there were false prophets.
    <br>But the true prophets always pointed out something and it became reality.
    <br>So that's where you can see, if somebody is actually a prophet or not.
    <br>People think: "Oh, this will happen today or tomorrow."
    <br>Some people betting, gambling, thinking they could see in the future and win a lot of money.
    <br>They are not true prophets.
    <br>When the man of God says something, we should all listen.
    <br>And I will now be more convinced to constantly listen to what the man of God says.
    <br>That's wonderful.
    <br>What advice can you give to all our viewers who are watching you
    <br>concerning the prophetic message which almost every week the man of God delivers publicly in the service?

    <br>My name is Tee-Mac Omotshola Iseli.
    <br>I'm from the Itsekiri tribe from the Niger Delta.
    <br>I'm a concert flautist. I sing. I have a band called Gold Convention.
    <br>And I'm a Nigerian.
    <br>Keep on watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Thank you so much for being with us today. Thank you for giving us your time.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>That was the interview with Tee-Mac Omatshola Iseli offering further insight
    <br>into the prophetic message spoken by Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and confirming that truly, the great star he prophesied about in the live service was indeed Michael Jackson.
    <br>Michael Jackson leaves behind his three young children - Prince Michael Joseph Jackson Jr,
    <br>Paris Michael Katherine Jackson and Prince Michael Joseph Jackson II,
    <br>his parents and eight brothers and sisters.
    <br>Michael Jackson Death PROPHECY - TB JOSHUA (2009)
    <br>Prayer is a salve for every sore and remedy for every malady.
    <br>And when we are afflicted and in distress, we should give ourselves to prayer.
    <br>We at Emanuel TV and The Synagogue, Church of All Nations pray for Michael Jackson's family,
    <br>friends and fans worldwide
    <br>that God would give them the grace, strength and fortitude to bear this devastating loss.
    <br>Let us remember always the blessing of the world is a fading thing
    <br>and so is the life itself on which it is bestowed.
    <br>As the blessing is fading away, so is the life that carries it.
    <br>But be encouraged, although the blessing given by the world enriches the body temporarily,
    <br>the blessing of God enriches the soul for eternity.
    <br>Let your heart and mind rise and seek Jesus Christ and the things that are above
    <br>so that you can be comforted under the present sorrow.
