    <br>Congratulations, Emmanuel TV family!
    <br>Congratulations, viewers all over the world!
    <br>Emmanuel TV has received an award from one of the most popular globally engaging,
    <br>reputable and objective websites which cuts across nationalities, race and class.
    <br>Think about it. What website could that be?
    <br>YouTube!
    <br>Yes, Emmanuel TV has received this award from YouTube.
    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>His name is called Emmanuel
    <br>For surpassing the milestone of 100,000 subscribers on our YouTube channel Emmanuel TV.
    <br>And this is the accompanying letter.
    <br>Let's read it.
    <br>From YouTube:
    <br>You've just done something very few YouTube creators accomplish:
    <br>You had an astonishing 100,000 people subscribe to your channel.
    <br>We know numbers on YouTube can get really big,
    <br>but we hope you don't lose sight of the reality behind that six-digit milestone.
    <br>Each and every person who has subscribed to your channel was touched by what you did.
    <br>They were inspired or challenged or entertained.
    <br>You made it to this milestone with hard work, perseverance,
    <br>and - chances are - a healthy sense of humor.
    <br>What you've accomplished can't be taken away from you.
    <br>And we'd like to recognize you and all your hard work with this silver play button,
    <br>a small token of our esteem and respect.
    <br>We know you don't do this for rewards.
    <br>You do it because you have a drive to create and share,
    <br>and because  you've found an audience who cares.
    <br>Believe us when we say that we can't wait to see what you do next.
    <br>A million subscribers may seem a long way off right now, but you're closer than you think
    <br>And we're rooting for you.
    <br>Congratulations. Sincerely, the CEO of YouTube.
