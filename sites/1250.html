    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23).
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23).
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23).
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23).
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23).
    <br>Greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23).
    <br>Yes, indeed, God is with us.
    <br>Whilst we are still standing, let's quickly pray together.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, we ask You right now that You would open the door of our hearts.
    <br>Help us not just to be mere hearers of Your Word but to be doers of Your Word
    <br>and let Your Word penetrate deep into our hearts, in Jesus' name.
    <br>And the people of God said...
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Amen. Right now, you may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Brother Chris from the UK
    <br>and I have the wonderful, incredible privilege today
    <br>of sharing with you the life-changing message of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I want to acknowledge God for what He has done in my life through Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the grace that God has given me to be here in your midst this morning.
    <br>Now today, I want to talk about something that I believe affects everyone,
    <br>but most especially this generation we are living in today
    <br>because you would agree with me that we are living in a very impatient generation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "We are living in an impatient generation".
    <br>Do you know what I mean by impatience?
    <br>You see people rushing up and down, hurrying up and down,
    <br>everything we want it now, this instant.
    <br>This is the generation we are living in today.
    <br>I just want to tell you a very quick story.
    <br>This is a true story - I guarantee you.
    <br>A couple of months ago, I was with one of my colleagues in our room.
    <br>He was in a rush; he was in a haste.
    <br>He wanted to go to the studio for an assignment.
    <br>And he quickly went to the toilet first.
    <br>When he came out of the toilet, the bathroom, his face looked a little bit distressed
    <br>and he said, "Chris, I think I need prayer".
    <br>"Prayer, what? You just went to the toilet! What has happened?"
    <br>He said, "Do you know what just happened?
    <br>I was in such a rush to leave the toilet that I flushed the toilet before I even used it".
    <br>I hope you understand what I mean.
    <br>He was in such a rush to leave the toilet
    <br>that before he sat down to use it, he flushed first
    <br>so he would not have to flush after he had finished using it.
    <br>Now, why am I saying this little story?
    <br>Because our generation today is an impatient generation.
    <br>We are in a generation of fast food, microwaves, instant connectivity through the internet.
    <br>We want things now, we want things quick, we want things sudden.
    <br>We want to take a shortcut, the quickest route.
    <br>That is the generation we are living in today.
    <br>And the truth, brethren, is that impatience is costly.
    <br>If you examine yourself, I think you would agree with me that
    <br>many of your greatest mistakes in life have happened as a result of impatience.
    <br>When we are impatient, we tend to disregard the fact that there is a time for everything.
    <br>That is how God has decreed and declared it;
    <br>God has set the right time for everything in this world.
    <br>Just look at the day, the sun comes out; when it is night, the moon appears -
    <br>they don't swap or exchange positions.
    <br>Have you ever heard the sun say to the moon,
    <br>"Please, do you mind covering my shift for a couple of hours? I have got a bit of a backpain".
    <br>Have you ever heard the moon calling out to the sun and saying,
    <br>"Do you mind, next week I'm going out with my wife for dinner.
    <br>Do you mind covering for that night for the sun to just come out?"
    <br>No! They don't swap, they don't exchange positions - they are fixed.
    <br>God has set an appointed time and season for everything that has to do with us.
    <br>There is a time to grow,
    <br>a time to face challenges, persecution and troubles.
    <br>There is a time to overcome and there is a time to show the proceeds of victory.
    <br>There is a time for everything.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There is a time for everything".
    <br>Tell your other neighbour, "There is a time for everything".
    <br>In our impatient generation today, so often we don't wait for God's appointed time
    <br>because our hearts are so busy, occupied with worldly considerations -
    <br>we are comparing ourselves with others.
    <br>"Everyone at my age range is getting married. I need to get married."
    <br>"Everyone is planning for this particular business at this time.
    <br>I need to join them as well."
    <br>Because of that, we are quick to make decisions out of impatience
    <br>and your greatest mistakes will happen because of impatience.
    <br>Just check your life; check yourself.
    <br>Whenever you are in a hurry, you easily make a mistake
    <br>and oftentimes, that mistake can be costly - costly mistakes that may pull you back or down.
    <br>So I want to tell you today:
    <br>First and foremost, God's response is not for those in a hurry.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God's response is not for those in a hurry".
    <br>This means, people of God, that we should be patient and let God answer us on His schedule, not ours
    <br>because at God's time, everything is beautiful.
    <br>Now this brings us to the title of today's message: 'No Reason To Rush'
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour" - just give your neighbour a bit of a warning finger!
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, take it easy! There is no reason to rush!"
    <br>Now you can give your neighbour a pad and say,
    <br>"Neighbour, calm down. There is no reason to rush!"
    <br>Now talk to yourself, say your name, "My name, be still. There is no reason to rush!
    <br>Calm down; take it easy".
    <br>Because we are in such a rush today.
    <br>So we are going to deal with that impatience.
    <br>Turn with me in your Bible to the Book of Hebrews 6:11-12
    <br>which is our proof text for today's message.
    <br>Hebrews 6:11-12.
    <br>"We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end..."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "To the very end".
    <br>If what you enjoy does not last to the end,  it is not of God.
    <br>To the end.
    <br>Blessed is he who endures to the end.
    <br>You may be great but without preparation and time that greatness will not last to the end.
    <br>You can have some levels of success but without preparation and time
    <br>you will face challenges that will topple that success.
    <br>You may be blessed but without preparation and time
    <br>that blessing will be fading away until it's gone at the time you need it most.
    <br>To the end - now let's continue.
    <br>It says, "We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end,
    <br>so that what you hope for may be fully realised.
    <br>We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience
    <br>inherit what has been promised".
    <br>What is the Scripture talking about here?
    <br>Faith coupled with patience inherits the promises of God.
    <br>As Christians, our tools are patience, perseverance and endurance.
    <br>These are our tools, our instruments.
    <br>Now just imagine, you are in your house, and you have a fault with your shower.
    <br>Maybe the shower has stopped working or maybe the toilet has stopped working
    <br>because people keep flushing before instead of afterwards
    <br>and you have to call a plumber.
    <br>You call a plumber to your house to come and fix this problem.
    <br>And the plumber comes in, and you show him the problem,
    <br>"Please, Mr Plumber, help me out here. The water is gone.
    <br>I can't shower; I can't use the toilet".
    <br>The plumber says, "I can fix the problem but do you have any tools?"
    <br>"What? You're the plumber. You are supposed to bring the tools!
    <br>What do you mean you come to my house to fix this problem and you don't have tools?
    <br>How can you solve this problem without your tools?
    <br>Without your spanner, your this, that -
    <br>all of the tools necessary to open up the shower and correct the problem?
    <br>You don't have your tools and you come to fix the problem?"
    <br>I think you would question the genuineness of that plumber.
    <br>You may likely say, "The plumber is a quack".
    <br>You may likely call the company and complain,
    <br>"You sent a plumber to my house without any tools!"
    <br>As a Christian, how can your genuineness be confirmed if we don't see your tools -
    <br>your patience, perseverance and endurance?
    <br>Hebrews 12:1-2 says that we should run the race with perseverance.
    <br>Perseverance is an essential instrument for our faith.
    <br>Patience, perseverance, forbearance, endurance are the tools of genuine Christians.
    <br>But brethren, so many times today, when we face a test of faith,
    <br>we begin to look for alternatives, shortcuts because we lack those tools.
    <br>We are too impatient to wait for God's time.
    <br>The Bible says that faith strengthens the believer to persevere
    <br>even when the promise of God seems to delay in its fulfilment.
    <br>Many times, we are struggling, striving against a certain challenge, obstacle, problem
    <br>and we don't seem to be able to overcome.
    <br>It is so easy for us to get frustrated but we don't know that God is testing our faith.
    <br>Let me try - quick example.
    <br>We like examples in these messages.
    <br>Can I get three chairs, please.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Just a quick example to demonstrate the importance of patience, perseverance and endurance.
    <br>Alright. Are you with me, people of God?
    <br>I want to hear you. Are you with me, people of God?
    <br>So this is my journey to the throne as a Christian.
    <br>My journey to where God has destined me to meet my destiny.
    <br>I want to show you my destiny in this particular example.
    <br>This is my destiny.
    <br>See the wonderful fruits that God has waiting for me.
    <br>But in the journey to my destiny, I have some obstacles, challenges, troubles, temptations.
    <br>Now, in the course of my journey as a Christian, I meet this obstacle
    <br>and I try with my natural strength, I try everything to move the obstacle,
    <br>I try with my intelligence, wisdom, connections - no way!
    <br>The obstacle refuses to budge.
    <br>It is a tiring exercise.
    <br>I want to tell you the identifying qualities of Christians.
    <br>Christians have no alternatives.
    <br>Shortcuts are not part of our vocabulary.
    <br>Alternatives have no definition in our dictionary.
    <br>We only have one way - Jesus.
    <br>Jesus is not a way; Jesus is not one of the ways.
    <br>Jesus is The Way, The Truth, The Life.
    <br>There is only one way to our destiny - Jesus!
    <br>There is no other way.
    <br>So if I meet this obstacle and I'm trying to move it -
    <br>I have fasted, I have prayed, I tried everything
    <br>and the obstacle refuses to budge - what do I do as a Christian?
    <br>I wait patiently for the Lord.
    <br>To a man of faith, delay is not denial.
    <br>Don't misinterpret God's silence as rejection.
    <br>Even when He seems to be quiet, God is still saying something.
    <br>Perhaps in this obstacle, God is telling you, He is speaking to you,
    <br>saying, "My son, be patient. I'm preparing you for the challenges ahead".
    <br>"My daughter, be patient. There is no reason to rush.
    <br>I'm strengthening your desire for Me."
    <br>Because there is a time and a season for everything.
    <br>But our generation today - impatience, in a hurry, haste, rush -
    <br>we meet this obstacle, we are trying to move it - no way.
    <br>We begin to look around, "Maybe, there is another way".
    <br>The moment you have that thought, "There is another way, a shortcut, an alternative",
    <br>don't worry; satan is there to provide you one.
    <br>"Pst, Chris, come over here."
    <br>"What? Where?"
    <br>"This way, this way! Come! This way!"
    <br>"What is going on?"
    <br>"Chris, go upstairs. There is a quick way. God doesn't want you to know that way
    <br>but it will take you straight to the destiny, straight to the throne,
    <br>a shortcut, not all these obstacles. Let's go.
    <br>Come on, let me show you the shortcut.
    <br>I will show you the shortcut right now."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Satan says, "Look it is just this way. Just round the corner.
    <br>You will get there very fast".
    <br>Because we are so young, we believe we can do it on our own, without reverence to God.
    <br>We trust our wisdom, intelligence, connections, science, organisations, works.
    <br>We say, "Ok, let's go".
    <br>Now, the first thing that happens when you take an alternative - let me tell you.
    <br>When you leave God's ways, you are on your own.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>No guard, no guide.
    <br>No protection, no direction.
    <br>Satan can easily strike.
    <br>Satan can easily hit you.
    <br>He can hit you with temptation, destruction, distraction.
    <br>But before you know, you think you are on your way to your destiny -
    <br>you just take time, maybe there is a friend there, sit down and have a chat,
    <br>start a business conversation, business deal going on -
    <br>you are delaying; instead of you to be moving to your destiny, you are moving away;
    <br>instead of you to be closer to God, you are drawing away.
    <br>Satan may suddenly send a beautiful lady your way - temptation comes,
    <br>temptation strikes.
    <br>All of the time, the direction you took that you thought would take you on a shortcut
    <br>is ending up taking you away from your destiny, away from the ways of God.
    <br>We are deceived.
    <br>In this process, many of us touch what we are not supposed to touch,
    <br>we begin to taste what we are not supposed to taste,
    <br>we begin to see what we are not supposed to see.
    <br>When you get to a point here and say, "How do I go on?,
    <br>they say, "Look this man over here will help you.
    <br>He has connections, money, this, that, everything.
    <br>But he needs you to do this.
    <br>You must do this first".
    <br>Compromise your faith, compromise your Christianity.
    <br>"You must do this, you must do that. Join this association, join this society."
    <br>In the process of trying to beat God's appointed time,
    <br>many of us find ourselves entangled with conditions we are unable to meet,
    <br>thus jeopardising our career and the promise of God in our lives.
    <br>But some of us can even steal, kill, destroy,
    <br>thinking that we are going to get to our destiny,
    <br>not knowing that we are being led on a wild goose chase.
    <br>You say, "I must be getting there yet; I must be nearly there!
    <br>What is happening? I must almost be there!"
    <br>You say, "Oh, look! There is a way through the back here!
    <br>Let me try it around the back! Maybe, this will take me to my destiny!
    <br>Maybe, this will take me to the throne! Oh my God!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you know what has happened?
    <br>I finally reached a dead end!
    <br>No way here, no way there!
    <br>Only way back.
    <br>I have gone all this way, wasted so much time
    <br>wasted so many opportunities, thinking I'm taking a shortcut
    <br>thinking it would take me to my destiny
    <br>and each suggestion of satan has only taken me away.
    <br>And look, I can see it! I can see the destiny there!
    <br>I can see it but I can't get there.
    <br>Oh, it's very painful.
    <br>It's very painful, people of God.
    <br>It's very painful.
    <br>Let me tell you something.
    <br>Only Jesus, the Owner of your destiny can take you to your destiny.
    <br>Political connections cannot.
    <br>Worldly associations cannot.
    <br>Powerful affiliations cannot.
    <br>Only Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And now, here I am.
    <br>I have to now go back; I have got to retrace my steps.
    <br>I wasted so much time.
    <br>I have got my hands dirty.
    <br>I have got my heart corrupted, thinking I'm going to my destiny,
    <br>thinking I'm getting to the throne; not knowing, I'm only destroying myself.
    <br>Oh God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So here we are, retracing our steps.
    <br>Many old people today are doing what they were supposed to have done when they were younger
    <br>but tried to move the hands of the clock forward;
    <br>they tried to beat God's time and found themselves back to where they began,
    <br>back to where they started, back to square one.
    <br>Here I am again.
    <br>Here I am again with the same obstacle.
    <br>Now, let me tell you something, people of God.
    <br>If I had waited patiently for the Lord,
    <br>if I had not listened to that deceptive, destructive voice,
    <br>let me tell you what would have happened.
    <br>Sorry, sir. Just come here.
    <br>For this example, my brother here will represent me and you,
    <br>and I'm going to represent God when you are in such kind of situation.
    <br>So my brother, just stand here.
    <br>My brother has tried everything to remove the obstacle -
    <br>tried power, might, human effort - no way!
    <br>And he is waiting on God, waiting for God's time.
    <br>God, the moment he sees this His son has enough experience and maturity,
    <br>he has been prepared well enough,
    <br>he has those tools of patience, perseverance and endurance,
    <br>his desire for Christ has been strengthened -
    <br>do you know what God will do? - "Come, sir, follow me!"
    <br>"Come!"
    <br>"Take your destiny!"
    <br>"Take it!"
    <br>You take it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, what happened there?
    <br>At God's appointed time, you will move without any personal effort required,
    <br>without any stress, tension, pressure.
    <br>You just move because God has already prepared the way.
    <br>Now, what am I trying to say here, brethren?
    <br>No matter your situation as a Christian, God is always one step ahead of you.
    <br>He's there. He's with you in the trial; He's with you in the trouble.
    <br>He may not seem to respond immediately because He's testing your patience.
    <br>He wants to make sure that by the time you reach your destiny,
    <br>you will not crack, explode and lose everything because you don't have enough preparation.
    <br>Look at the three Hebrew men that were thrown into the fiery furnace.
    <br>Nebuchadnezzar and his servants looked in, and they saw four men.
    <br>And the fourth looked like the Son of God.
    <br>Because before they were thrown into the furnace, Jesus was already one step ahead of them.
    <br>I don't know what furnace you have been thrown in today.
    <br>I don't know what you are facing.
    <br>Perhaps you are in the furnace of false accusation, the furnace of persecution,
    <br>the furnace of disappointment or sickness.
    <br>One thing I know, people of God, as Christians, God is one step ahead of you.
    <br>Don't give up; don't give in.
    <br>Allow Him to stay burning within you so you can endure whatever condition you face
    <br>and your challenges will make you stronger.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the best example of this incredible principle.
    <br>You know the life of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Jesus lived on the earth 33 years.
    <br>The first 30 years were preparation.
    <br>Even though He knew He had come to change, save, deliver the world,
    <br>He waited patiently for the fullness of time.
    <br>Just imagine how many people went into his carpenter shop
    <br>who were sick, oppressed, demon-possessed
    <br>and He had the power to set them free, deliver them but it was not yet time.
    <br>Even when He started His ministry, His mother, His brothers were urging Him,
    <br>"Go ahead, go on, show yourself to the world!"
    <br>Jesus said, "My time has not yet come. For you, anytime can be right".
    <br>In three years, Jesus Christ turned the entire world upside down.
    <br>But look today, even this impatience has infiltrated Kingdom business.
    <br>You see people today, they don't want to march with God; they just want to march for Him.
    <br>Marching with God is a time of discipleship.
    <br>Marching for God is a time of acting on His behalf.
    <br>People today, they go into ministry, they just want to go straight to start praying, ministering to people.
    <br>So many people have seen it - pastors, ministers of God from around the world come to this church.
    <br>They will say to the man of God, "T.B. Joshua, please pray for me for power.
    <br>Pray for me for anointing" but I have not heard anyone say, "Pray for me for character".
    <br>Character takes time and preparation but character is the food of anointing.
    <br>Look, let me give you an example of this.
    <br>I was watching a Christian programme the other day and it came up an advert.
    <br>They said, "Come to this prophetic school and learn how to prophesy in three days".
    <br>Three days? My God.
    <br>Look, I'm not trying to tell you that there is nothing impossible with God.
    <br>God is God; there is nothing He cannot do.
    <br>But spiritual gifts are not subject to human timing.
    <br>When Jesus spoke to His disciples in Acts 1, He said,
    <br>"Wait in Jerusalem until the promise of the Father".
    <br>They now began to query Him about the time He would come.
    <br>He told them in Acts 1:7, "It is not for you to know the times or dates
    <br>the Father has set by His own authority".
    <br>We just wait for God; we don't push Him or instruct Him in the way He should go.
    <br>We submit to His will and at God's time everything is beautiful.
    <br>Look, I realise - and once again I'm calling this message as a time of self-examination -
    <br>I realise that the majority of people, especially the young people today,
    <br>the reason that they are so much in a hurry, so impatient
    <br>is because they are comparing themselves with others.
    <br>So I want to give you a powerful secret that I believe will help you today.
    <br>There is no competition in destiny.
    <br>What is yours is yours.
    <br>You hear some people today say, "This guy took my star.
    <br>He took my destiny, he took this".
    <br>There is only one person who can stop you from reaching your destiny - you.
    <br>Why then are we busy envying; why then are we so jealous -
    <br>envying ourselves, jealous of ourselves?
    <br>Envying is a waste of time.
    <br>Look, let me try and practicalise this.
    <br>Sorry, sir, if the two of you can just stand up.
    <br>Now, my brothers you see here are colleagues and they are both doing business.
    <br>Today, you will see that maybe one of them, the business starts moving;
    <br>the business starts running.
    <br>The other one, the business is a bit slow, a little bit stagnant.
    <br>He will begin to look and say, "What is this guy doing that his business is running?"
    <br>After all, I started the business before him; I'm more equipped.
    <br>I have more experience. What is going on?
    <br>Maybe he has gone somewhere; maybe there is a charm.
    <br>Maybe it is this, maybe it is that".
    <br>You begin to look for faults; you begin to diagnose this, that.
    <br>Envy, jealousy, comparing yourself with others.
    <br>But let me tell you something, people of God.
    <br>My brother's time to walk may be my brother's time to run.
    <br>And this my brother's time to run may be his time to walk.
    <br>Why then are we jealous of ourselves?
    <br>Why do we compare ourselves?
    <br>Our journey is different.
    <br>What matters is that you follow the ways of the Lord.
    <br>Not that we are fighting ourselves, envy - "This guy is young and he has gone up like that."
    <br>You don't know his journey; his journey is different to yours.
    <br>His destiny is different to yours.
    <br>You may have your seats, sirs.
    <br>As I round up, let me challenge you.
    <br>What you are praying for today, are you prepared for it?
    <br>Many of us are praying, "God, bless my business, bless this, I want this, that".
    <br>Are you ready for it?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua said that many of us want to become managing directors of companies
    <br>but we cannot even manage our own homes.
    <br>Many of us want to be the owners of our own companies
    <br>but we cannot keep our own car clean.
    <br>Many young people are here today; it is not just God that brought them here.
    <br>They are looking for a young lady, young man -
    <br>"God, send me my destined partner, my husband, my wife" because of your age.
    <br>You see others getting married; your parents say, "You must marry";
    <br>the society says, "You must marry"; you want to get married at all costs.
    <br>But even your own bedroom, you can't keep it clean.
    <br>Let me give a word of advice to young people around the world.
    <br>And this is a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Because satan is attacking the institution of the Christian home today.
    <br>Marriages around the world seem to be scattering; divorce is rampant.
    <br>There are two things that build a successful marriage:
    <br>the right time and the right person.
    <br>Please take note: It is not the right person that brings the right time.
    <br>It is the right time that brings the right person.
    <br>Wait for God's time and your marriage will stand the test of time.
    <br>Don't marry because by society, everyone is getting married.
    <br>"My age - I'm supposed to get married."
    <br>No, wait for God's time so that by the time you are equipped, you are prepared,
    <br>you are at the place of your destiny.
    <br>At that time, by the time you get married, you can manage your home,
    <br>not just populate the world with children that will end up becoming a nuisance to society
    <br>but bring children that will build, invest and change the world.
    <br>In conclusion:
    <br>God does not want any one of us to come to the end of our days, saying,
    <br>"I could have been, I should have been, I would have been".
    <br>It would be very painful if you realise this by the time your hair has greyed,
    <br>your strength has waned and your dreams have been scattered.
    <br>Wait patiently for the Lord.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>I'm not saying you should be idle.
    <br>I'm not saying you should just sit down and let God's time come. No!
    <br>Work as if everything depends on you; pray as if everything depends on God.
    <br>Combine hard work with quiet confidence in God for the future.
    <br>Make use of every opportunity that comes your way and see every minute as important.
    <br>One thing you must know:
    <br>Only by trusting in Christ can your life have value.
    <br>Only by trusting in Christ can your life have meaning.
    <br>You will be able to say with the Psalmist, "What else do I want in Heaven but God?
    <br>Since I have God, what else do I want on earth?
    <br>My mind, my body may grow weak but God is my strength; He is all I need".
    <br>Brethren, there is no reason to rush
    <br>for I want to assure you, we shall reach the end of this road
    <br>in God's time, in God's way, for God's glory.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus' name.
