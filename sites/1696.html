  <p>    
    <br>Come on, wave your hands and say, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Wave your hands and say, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Because there is no bondage; every chain in your life is broken today.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Say, "Every chain in my life is broken today, in the name of Jesus Christ!"
    <br>If you believe that, wave your hands and say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Wave your hands for His mercy; wave your hands and thank Him for His favour, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "Happy New Year!"
    <br>We are still in the atmosphere of the season.
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "Happy New Year!"
    <br>Greet the person behind you, say, "Happy New Year!"
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we greet you: Happy New Year, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Look at your neighbour, and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>no matter what my yesterday was like, no matter what 2019 was like for me, the best is yet to come!"
    <br>If you believe that, put your hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, this is a new year, a new dream,
    <br>a new opportunity to maintain a steady focus in an unsteady world."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, change your attitude, your character and your general approach to life."
    <br>When this is done, a new dream will come.
    <br>Come on, wave your hands and say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Wave your hands and bless the name of the Lord!
    <br>Come on, wave your hands and thank Him for His compassion.
    <br>Thank Him because we are unworthy to be in His presence
    <br>but He brought us here by His grace.
    <br>Come on, wave your hands and thank Him.
    <br>Thank Him for what He will do today in your life, in Jesus' name!
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God and say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Are you still keeping to your resolutions?
    <br>It is easy to say we will do so but much more important to live like it.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says this is a year of humility.
    <br>I want each and every one of us to see ourselves clearly in this prophecy -
    <br>only then will we be able to change.
    <br>This is a good time to pause in our often busy lives
    <br>and take some time to reflect on the past and the lessons it has taught us
    <br>and to consider our future directions.
    <br>I want you to take some time to ask yourself some questions
    <br>and I want you to honestly reflect on the answers.
    <br>What are the questions?
    <br>Are you serving God to the best of your ability?
    <br>What habits do you have in your life that are having a negative impact on your quality life?
    <br>What do you need to learn more or do more to be a better person -
    <br>perhaps at your job, in your marriage, in your relationship with God
    <br>or how you helped your fellow brothers?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Examine yourself."
    <br>Examine yourself and you will discover the area which you need to grow more,
    <br>in order to make more positive results in this year, 2020.
    <br>Examine yourself.
    <br>In the Book of Joshua 24:23, the Bible tells us that when Joshua was telling the children of Israel
    <br>to forsake their foreign gods, their idols and follow God,
    <br>he meant forsaking their old selves.
    <br>Joshua knew that promising to be a better person could be mere lip service,
    <br>lacking fundamental roots in God.
    <br>We may say we are not serving physical idols - that may be true.
    <br>However, what of your impatience, intolerance, bad habits, anger, doubts
    <br>that oftentimes occupy our minds and influence the way we act?
    <br>These are the things that stand in the way of worshipping God.
    <br>If you are still worshipping your old self, there may likely not be anything new in the year.
    <br>The truth is:
    <br>We make the year new by the way we live it.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>this is a new opportunity, a new dream to be changed,
    <br>a new opportunity to maintain a steady focus on Christ Jesus."
    <br>And this will humbly bring me to this message:
    <br>A NEW OPPORTUNITY
    <br>Let someone say, "A new opportunity."
    <br>If you believe, say, "A new opportunity for me to be renewed,
    <br>for me to be revived, for me to be redeemed,
    <br>for me to be blessed, for me to be saved."
    <br>Whatever decision you have made, whatever decision you are making right now,
    <br>be sure it is rooted in God's Word,
    <br>otherwise it will be idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>When we say something lightly, "I am a Christian. I'm a minister of God.
    <br>I'm born into a Christian home. I have been baptized in water several times;
    <br>all these are mere claims borne out of conviction but not out of conversion.
    <br>We may have all manner of titles, viewers all over the world;
    <br>these are in words, but not in deeds.
    <br>Remember, knowing God is not only to see His works or experience His supernatural blessings
    <br>but it is all about learning His ways.
    <br>The Bible says God's ways, though hard to the ungodly,
    <br>are profitable and desirable because they lead men to safety - unto eternal life.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>be humble and experience a new opportunity, a new goal, a new dream.
    <br>Now, let's turn our Bible to the Book of Ephesians and let us take this first proof text -
    <br>the Book of Ephesians chapter 4.
    <br>Let us start our reading from verse 17.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord,
    <br>that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the futility of their mind,
    <br>having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God,
    <br>because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart;
    <br>who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lewdness,
    <br>to work all uncleanness with greediness.
    <br>But you have not so learned Christ,
    <br>if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus:
    <br>that you put off, concerning your former conduct,
    <br>the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,
    <br>and be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
    <br>and that you put on the new man which was created according to God,
    <br>in true righteousness and holiness."
    <br>The Bible says we must put on the new man.
    <br>Now, ask yourself,
    <br>"Have you put on the new man?"
    <br>This is a question of the heart: "Have I put on the new man?"
    <br>We are in the presence of God to receive His blessings.
    <br>We are so much concerned about the blessings of God
    <br>but we lack the character of God to maintain the blessings of God.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that the character of God is like oil in a lamp.
    <br>Just as you need the oil in a lamp to keep the fire burning,
    <br>so also you need the character of God to maintain the blessings of God.
    <br>This is an opportunity for us to assess our lives and consider the areas we may have missed the mark.
    <br>Remember, those who are converted make the year new by the way they live it.
    <br>Are you converted, going by the way you live, by the way you act,
    <br>by the way you respond to situations?
    <br>Apostle Paul explains the reality of being converted
    <br>when you read the Book of Galatians 2:20.
    <br>He says, "I have been crucified with Christ, therefore I no longer live but Christ lives in me.
    <br>The life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God."
    <br>This means those who are converted live by faith
    <br>while those who are merely convinced live by sight.
    <br>The Bible says they are controlled by senses; they are never consistent in all their doings.
    <br>They can be good today; tomorrow they will be bad.
    <br>Those who are merely convinced can be Christians
    <br>but they are Christians controlled by satanic devices.
    <br>Unless we are converted,
    <br>what we see, what we hear, what we feel, what our circumstances look like
    <br>can affect our relationship with God.
    <br>If we are truly members of the household of faith,
    <br>then our conduct, our behaviour as Christians, as believers, must match our faith.
    <br>It is not just to confess that I'm a Christian,
    <br>but our conduct, our behaviour must match our faith.
    <br>Remember, faith is of man's heart.
    <br>It is important for us to know that our heart plays a major role in our success in life or failure.
    <br>That is why Prophet T.B. Joshua says we must make sure we take hold of our heart.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>Do not let your heart cause you to sin or rebel against God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have embarked on a journey that has twelve different stops.
    <br>I know we all know that.
    <br>Each stop has its own challenges, distractions, attractions, temptations, persecutions;
    <br>name them.
    <br>Each stop has its own unique challenges that demand special tactics and strategies to overcome.
    <br>Brethren, we all need to fasten our prayer belts lest we fall into temptation
    <br>of repeating our own stories.
    <br>Don't say you are too strong.
    <br>"I'm a Christian. I attend The Synagogue Church Of All Nations. I belong to that, this church,
    <br>so satan cannot touch me." - Who told you that?
    <br>The Bible says in the Book of Matthew 26:41, "Watch and pray."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Watch and pray
    <br>lest we fall into temptation because the Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak."
    <br>Don't let satan catch you unprepared.
    <br>As a Christian, your heart must be your watchman.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your heart must be your watchman."
    <br>Satan does not want any good for us.
    <br>When your heart becomes your watchman, you will do what Jesus expects from you.
    <br>When your heart becomes your watchman, you will see what Jesus is looking at.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let your heart become your watchman."
    <br>Everything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>If you are to solve the problems of today using the old approach,
    <br>you are not going to make anything new in the year
    <br>because our enemy, the thief of the soul, is advancing in the way he is moving
    <br>just as our situations are becoming uncommon.
    <br>Uncommon blessings attract uncommon challenges.
    <br>The good thing is, if your commitment this year comes from faith,
    <br>you may stumble but you will not fall, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>You may stumble, you may see tests but those tests will not overpower you,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Continue to trust Christ Jesus in all circumstances.
    <br>It is the only way to get ready for the things we are not ready for.
    <br>His love does not keep us away from trials but He promises to see us through.
    <br>Trusting in Christ Jesus is not a mere intellectual acknowledgement but adherence to His Word,
    <br>commitment to Him, total dependence upon Jesus for everything, come what may.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>this is a new dream, a new goal for me, a new opportunity to be redeemed,
    <br>a new opportunity to be humbled, a new opportunity to be restored."
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>What is the way out to experience this new dream?
    <br>Finally,
    <br>the Bible says in the Book of 2 Chronicles 7:14,
    <br>"If My people who are called by My name can humble themselves,
    <br>turn from their wicked ways, their bad habits,
    <br>I will forgive their sins, I will hear them from Heaven and I will heal their situations,
    <br>I will heal their land."
    <br>This means, when we come to Jesus Christ in humility and sincerity of heart,
    <br>He will receive us with compassion; He is a merciful Father.
    <br>This is high time to begin to seek for righteousness and humility.
    <br>The Book of Proverbs 15:33 says,
    <br>"The fear of the Lord teaches a man wisdom, for humility comes before honour."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, "Be humble!"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, I will be humble because humility comes before honour."
    <br>True humility is total dependence upon God for everything.
    <br>If you want to fit into God's divine arrangement today,
    <br>you must change your approach to life and the way you relate to people.
    <br>Remember, no one can succeed alone;
    <br>we need good people, informed people and inspired people
    <br>to make it in our respective callings.
    <br>But always remember that success has to do with challenges.
    <br>Success has to do with encounters, tests and trials.
    <br>Success does not start with pride; it begins with humility.
    <br>Success does not start with impatience; it begins with patience.
    <br>It does not start with disobedience; it begins with obedience.
    <br>It does not start with doubt; it begins with faith.
    <br>It does not start with greed; it begins with generosity.
    <br>Success does not start with fear; it begins with boldness.
    <br>James 4:10 says when we humble ourselves, God will lift us up.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When we humble ourselves, God will lift us up."
    <br>If you have realised how far you have been from God, let us come back to Him.
    <br>This is an opportunity to quit our wrongs, our setbacks.
    <br>Don't forget your determination to pray the more, to read your Bible the more,
    <br>to love for God's sake the more and to help the more.
    <br>Your determination to be a better person - this will set you on a good road to good life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This will set you on a good road to good life."
    <br>There may be reasons to be troubled
    <br>but always remember there is an infinitely greater reason not to be.
    <br>As we walk on this road,
    <br>do not be agitated, do not be stressed out as a Christian or thrown into confusion.
    <br>Let your situation always produce a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>This should be your determination for this year, 2020.
    <br>Let us bow down our heads for prayer.
    <br>Say, "Holy Spirit, I have come to You this morning in humility and sincerity of heart.
    <br>Give me Your desire to love You the more, to honour You the more.
    <br>Give me the desire to be less of me and be more of You, in Jesus' name."
    <br>Come on, put your hands together and thank Jesus.
    <br>Thank Him.
