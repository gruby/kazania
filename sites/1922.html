    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Viewers, each day, as we recall God's track record in our lives,
    <br>this is undeniable evidence that God is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>In these trying times, God has become our solace, lifeline, very present help in trouble.
    <br>Because He is Spirit, He is not far from those who seek Him,
    <br>so distance can never be a barrier to the move of God.
    <br>Now, to build your faith, we have a life changing testimony,
    <br>one out of many, of those who received their healing from the deadly COVID-19 virus,
    <br>during one of our 'DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER' interactive prayer sessions.
    <br>Before we listen to this family calling us all the way from South Africa,
    <br>let us watch how they received their miracle.
    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>- Good Morning, Prophetess Yinka.
    <br>- Good Morning, sir. How are you?
    <br>You are welcome.
    <br>My name is Marcel and the lady next to me is my wife. We are in South Africa.
    <br>The problem we are having is that my wife tested positive for COVID-19.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>What I do is customer service.
    <br>When we found out that one of my colleagues tested positive,
    <br>two days later, I started having itching in my throat and a dry cough.
    <br>Then, I went and got tested.
    <br>The following day, in the evening, I got my results, which came back positive.
    <br>Since then, I have been having flu, headaches, back pain and nasal pain.
    <br>For the last two days, I have been having chest pain and coughing.
    <br>The coughing has been very heavy; it's scary when I cough.
    <br>Yesterday morning when I woke up, I had a bad headache.
    <br>Do you all believe with all your heart that Jesus Christ will heal you from all these diseases, viruses?
    <br>With all our hearts, we believe this.
    <br>OK. We want you to know that distance is not a barrier for the move of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The fact that you are not here with us; we believe that as we are seeing you,
    <br>your heart is here with us in Nigeria.
    <br>The power of God will break every barrier of COVID-19 in your life, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>We also want you to know that our God is more effective, more powerful in distance.
    <br>That you are far away in South Africa does not reduce the authority and power of God.
    <br>I am here to let you know that Jesus Christ will heal you from that deadly virus.
    <br>I am a messenger; I am a breaker - to break this good news of healing and deliverance to you,
    <br>that it is the will of God to heal your family right now, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Right now, I command healing to every affected part of your body!
    <br>Wherever that virus is located in your body - I command it out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>You COVID-19, I call you by your name.
    <br>You sickness - out!
    <br>Vomit it out!
    <br>Vomit that sickness out!
    <br>I command that sickness in your lungs - out!
    <br>Vomit it out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Right now, I can sense your organs.
    <br>I can feel your lungs right now.

    <br>You sickness, disease - out!

    <br>Out - in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every root of the virus - out!
    <br>Out - in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.

    <br>I can breathe freely now.
    <br>Even my nose has opened up now.
    <br>I can breathe with my nose; I don't feel congested anymore.
    <br>I feel very light and my airways have opened up.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, as you see our sister here receiving her healing from that deadly virus,

    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Please, share with us your wonderful testimony.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>My name is Marcel.
    <br>This is my family.
    <br>We are from South Africa, Pretoria.
    <br>People of God, Good Morning.
    <br>My name is Zukiswa.
    <br>My name is Khwezi.
    <br>Good morning. My name is Thabang.
    <br>We are here to glorify God after being prayed for and being healed of COVID-19.
    <br>We would like to give glory to God and to actually thank the Lord for what He has done for us -
    <br>for the healing and deliverance we received for the infection we had - COVID-19.
    <br>I had throat irritation and chest pain.
    <br>I was coughing and had body pain.
    <br>My system was very weak; I could barely do anything at that time.
    <br>I was asleep most of the time.
    <br>I had loss of taste.
    <br>After developing symptoms, I went for testing and my result came back positive.
    <br>It was a very frightening moment; it was very difficult.
    <br>So we sent a prayer request for the Emmanuel TV Interactive Prayer.
    <br>We thank God because God located us and we received prayer through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>During the time we were being prayed for, I started feeling the urge to cough.
    <br>As the prophetess was praying for me, I was coughing and coughing and felt heat in my body.
    <br>I was coughing and some substances were coming out.
    <br>So, at that particular time, I knew I was receiving my healing; I knew I was being delivered from that virus.
    <br>The more I was coughing, the more the substances came out of my body;
    <br>I knew that the virus was coming out.
    <br>I thank God and glorify the name of Jesus.
    <br>These are my positive results, that confirmed that I had contracted COVID-19.
    <br>After I received my healing, I went back for testing so this is my negative result,
    <br>confirming that I no longer have the virus.
    <br>I am free, I was healed.
    <br>These are the results; positive and negative.
    <br>I no longer have the virus in my system.
    <br>I give glory to God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>After she tested positive, we decided to stay at home.
    <br>A few days later, I started developing symptoms.
    <br>I started coughing, experiencing heat, losing my sense of smell and taste, and also had headaches.
    <br>After contacting Emmanuel TV through The Distance Is Not A Barrier Programme -
    <br>which we thank the Lord for giving the inspiration to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>because it touches millions of people around the world -
    <br>they prayed for us, and during the prayer, I started coughing and vomiting poisonous substances.
    <br>I knew that Jesus, the Master Healer, was touching and healing me.
    <br>We give glory to God that we are healed after the prayer.
    <br>The children were also prayed for and they got their healing.
    <br>She also got a new job which she just started after her healing; she is now back at work.
    <br>I am also back to work as well an IT consultant.
    <br>We thank God! We are healed!
    <br>That virus is no longer is us and we give glory to God.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>My name is Thabang.
    <br>The problem that I had was that I was coughing a lot, sneezing and had nightmares.
    <br>When the prophetess prayed for me, the coughing, sneezing and nightmares were gone, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My name is Khwezi.
    <br>The problem I had was coughing and a sore throat.
    <br>The prophetess delivered me from the sickness and then I was healed.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Amen! We give glory to God.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Viewers, from a scientific angle, this is the positive medical report,
    <br>and scientifically, this is a negative medial report.
    <br>So both spiritually and scientifically, this is a clear evidence.
    <br>What else again?
    <br>There are no natural words to describe it, except to say, "Thank You, Jesus Christ."
    <br>The Book of Psalms 118:23 says, "This is the Lord's doing; it is wonderful in our eyes."
    <br>Viewers, God's works of wonders are of grace and they command our faith.
    <br>Now faith is reliance on someone stronger, smarter, wiser than we are,
    <br>and this is none other but our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
    <br>for He is the Way, the Truth, the Life, the Reality,
    <br>and there is no reality outside of Him.
    <br>Never forget that we treat but God heals.
    <br>So be sure to include God in your affairs as from today
    <br>and your victory is as sure as the rising of the sun.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>GOOD CHRISTIANS ARE GOOD CITIZENS
    <br>THIS VIDEO DOES NOT DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM SEEKING MEDICAL TREATMENT
    <br>THE TABLET, THE MEDICINE THE DOCTOR
    <br>HAS GIVEN YOU
    <br>IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD
    <br>WITH MEDICINE
    <br>YOU CANNOT BELIEVE IN GOD
    <br>WITHOUT MEDICINE
