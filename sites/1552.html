  <p>    
    <br>I am giving this confession whole-heartedly
    <br>that the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, Prophet T.B. Joshua and the whole family of The Synagogue
    <br>will forgive me for my sins.
    <br>I have really blasphemed against this church, The Synagogue.
    <br>I have really blasphemed against the man of God, Pastor T.B. Joshua.
    <br>By this time, I don't think you people would have been sitting down here
    <br>worshipping God because of the plans I had.
    <br>I once wrote a letter to the former Minister For Works and Transport,
    <br>informing him of all the atrocities I supposed were being perpetrated here.
    <br>I told him that three pregnant women were buried here.
    <br>I told him that everything here is devilishly done.
    <br>I gave him every instance in the letter.
    <br>I wanted them to come here and destroy this church.
    <br>I wrote to The Punch newspaper.
    <br>I wanted to make sure that this church is destroyed!
    <br>I didn't give up.
    <br>I went to The Guardian newspaper and told them that everything about this church
    <br>must be brought down because I hate Pastor T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I don't like him at all.
    <br>So, I started making plans to achieve this.
    <br>All this while, I have been planning in one way or the other to get this Pastor T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I even went as far as telling them that he lives beside the river
    <br>and that he got his power from the river.
    <br>I tried to meet people and convince them.
    <br>The way I talk because I am a good orator, I will make you believe
    <br>that truly, I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua getting his power from the river.
    <br>I told them everything about Prophet T.B. Joshua - that he got his power from the river
    <br>and he drove his wife away.
    <br>I told them that he used his private part to make money after which
    <br>he drove his wife away so that she would not understand where he got his power from.
    <br>Anytime I see a member of The SCOAN, it seems as if I am seeing fire.
    <br>I just want to crucify that person and clear him out of my way because I don't like them.
    <br>I did all these out of hatred and I don't want that church.
    <br>In the churches I attend, we were told that Pastor Joshua is a devil incarnate
    <br>and from this, we all had the notion that he is a devil incarnate.
    <br>I have a friend who lives around here.
    <br>Anytime I am passing by and I see Prophet T.B. Joshua conducting a healing service,
    <br>I would just say, "This man has started his magic again!"
    <br>I would run back saying to myself, "I don't want him to infest me with all these devilish acts".
    <br>I made people believe me and hate him -
    <br>that he is a devil incarnate and anything that is done here is of the devil.
    <br>I made sure that anywhere I went to, I criticized and persecuted him.
    <br>If I were to be Adisa (then Nigerian minister of work and housing) at that particular time,
    <br>The SCOAN would have been turned into a garage.
    <br>I was working in a bank.
    <br>I never knew these blasphemous acts had affected my job.
    <br>I lost everything I had in life because of my blasphemous acts.
    <br>One day, I was drinking in a beer parlour - I wanted to drink away my sorrow.
    <br>I was drinking my beer when a member of The SCOAN came in to buy a soft drink.
    <br>As I was drinking my beer, I did not know what prompted me to move close to him.
    <br>I told him what was happening to me and he said, "Do you know that God can restore your job?"
    <br>- I said, "Where is that?"
    <br>- He said, "In The SCOAN."
    <br>I said, "My friend, go and sit down.
    <br>Do you think I can be persuaded to partake in all these things you are doing?"
    <br>I refused.
    <br>He told me, "Look Victor, go to The SCOAN."
    <br>I said he should forget about that.
    <br>In fact, I stopped going to that beer parlour.
    <br>As I was passing by on Tuesday, something just pushed me.
    <br>I walked in through the gate there.
    <br>I saw a woman and I told her that I wanted to see the pastor.
    <br>She said that I should come on Wednesday and I would see him.
    <br>On that Wednesday, before 6am, I was the first person here.
    <br>When I came in, I wanted to see exactly what was happening here
    <br>because what we heard is that they don't preach about Jesus.
    <br>They told me that Prophet T.B. Joshua doesn't use the Bible.
    <br>How can he be preaching without a Bible?
    <br>All these things are demonic.
    <br>Even sometimes when we sing, we say, "Joshua bow, Synagogue bow", "everything shall bow."
    <br>Anytime we are in a beer parlour and we see some members of The SCOAN passing by,
    <br>we would start singing:
    <br>Jesus is a mighty God
    <br>He is a mighty God
    <br>Synagogue and Joshua
    <br>bow before Him
    <br>We will just equate them with those people.
    <br>When I came into the church, they took me to the newcomers' section.
    <br>I saw the inscriptions of Jesus.
    <br>I saw everything so immaculate.
    <br>Then I said, "Can this be the same place where I had the notion that they serve satan and demons?"
    <br>I walked along the pavement; I saw everything.
    <br>I was interested in reading all these things.
    <br>They are all Biblical words; no devilish words.
    <br>I kept quiet.
    <br>When I sat down, I saw the altar.
    <br>I said, "This is the altar they said three pregnant woman were buried."
    <br>I looked around if I would see anything.
    <br>I said maybe they covered it with a carpet so that people will not take notice of it."
    <br>When I got here, we prayed as people normally pray.
    <br>When they said, "In Jesus' name",
    <br>I said, "But I was expecting to hear, 'In Joshua's name'
    <br>or in any other name but it was 'In the name of Jesus' ".
    <br>As I sat down, they started showing videos.
    <br>When they were showing these videos, I was sitting with three men.
    <br>For 10 seconds, I was bleeding with tears in my heart.
    <br>I said, "Does it mean that all these things I've heard about this man
    <br>are false and a bitter impression about this person that never did me any wrong?"
    <br>I started shedding tears as I sat on my chair.
    <br>As I was shedding tears, the man sitting by my side saw me.
    <br>I quickly cleaned my face.
    <br>I did not want him to understand what I was doing.
    <br>I was guilty of everything.
    <br>Though I was hungry, I refused to stand up because I did not want to miss out on anything.
    <br>I wanted to see A to Z of what is happening in The SCOAN.
    <br>Then I said, "If God was not with this man, and working in this place,
    <br>can theses miracles be taking place?"
    <br>"No. God is with this man."
    <br>I said, "The first thing I have to do is to go back and confess."
    <br>My brothers and sisters in the Lord in The SCOAN and Pastor T.B. Joshua,
    <br>I kindly solicit that you forgive me of my sins and make me live a new life.
    <br>If I begin to recount all that I have said about this man, Prophet T.B. Joshua, it will fill a trailer.
    <br>I even told people in my village that Prophet T.B. Joshua drove his wife away because of magical powers.
    <br>I told them that they are not supposed to be within our area
    <br>that Prophet T.B. Joshua's wife should be ostracized because of the kind of life they have been living.
    <br>So I beg for forgiveness.
