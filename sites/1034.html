  <p>    
    <br>You are wonderful 
    <br>You are worthy oh Lord
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>- Good morning, Church! 
    <br>- Good morning.
    <br>Emmanuel to viewers all over the world.
    <br>Thank you for your time.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to believe that you are led here by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Can someone just come out and tell us how you were led here today by the Holy Spirit?
    <br>OK.
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>You were led by what?
    <br>Husband.
    <br>Go and sit down.
    <br>Who was led by the wife?
    <br>You were led by your wife?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you look at your life today; it is just the way our foundation started.
    <br>The beginning always has key leg.
    <br>Even to pray...
    <br>The way you started your prayer affects the whole prayer.
    <br>The way you come to church seems to affect your presence in the church.
    <br>It is just like that.
    <br>Even the way we start our business; we just look at our colleagues, someone who is making it,
    <br>whose business is going well.
    <br>Because of that you now choose to do the same business, which is very bad.
    <br>"Ah, that man is making it" - you will now walk towards the man, "Please, I want to invest in the same business."
    <br>The business you know about not seems to be good.
    <br>You approach the man, "Please, tell me how you started your business."
    <br>Even your education...
    <br>What you study in the university is a result of education of somebody, who is a minister of finance,
    <br>someone who is secretary general;
    <br>you want to go on internet to know what kind of subject... because of that you choose a course.
    <br>You want to be like that.
    <br>The beginning is always just the foundation affecting us.
    <br>Even our marriages today – the cause of collapsing, divorcing is as a result of how we met.
    <br>So, the beginning is just like that; it affects the whole structure.
    <br>Just like that.
    <br>Look at the children we give birth to.
    <br>Many of our children today; we can't tell, control, instruct, teach them, tell them what to do.
    <br>They become masters in the house.
    <br>Because of the beginning; the way we brought them up - the upbringing - we spoiled them.
    <br>We are not allowing them to taste some of the hard, difficult times we had in the past.
    <br>"These are my children, they must enjoy life. I suffered so much in life..."
    <br>By the time children grow up with that, they will think that life is all about bed of what?
    <br>Roses.
    <br>Life is not like that.
    <br>You have to allow them to taste some of the difficult parts of life.
    <br>Our beginning is the cause of what we are going through today.
    <br>We talk of worshipping God; many of us begin to understand what it means to worship God.
    <br>God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in what?
    <br>In Spirit and in truth.
    <br>But today; we never knew in the past...
    <br>We just go by the way our forefathers worshipped God – conventional.
    <br>It is there; the song to sing Him, how to do this...
    <br>Everything is in the syllabus; we are not allowing the Holy Spirit to inspire us.
    <br>Which area will the Holy Spirit inspire us
    <br>when everything we want to do is on the table, on the paper?
    <br>How will the Holy Spirit inspire us?
    <br>This virtually is our life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our life is full of copy – that is why we also, are copies.
    <br>Hardly will you see original or raw.
    <br>You cannot see raw again.
    <br>Material is what we are seeing.
    <br>Human beings have turned to material.
    <br>That is why we cannot invest, discover or bring a new thing to the world.
    <br>How will you?
    <br>You must be raw, original, the way God created you,
    <br>grow up and be inspired by your Creator.
    <br>From time to time you must be inspired by God
    <br>to change the world and be at the centre of your own world.
    <br>Are we inspired?
    <br>Everything about us today; your dress, hair, look...
    <br>We are sitting down, you are looking around to see the kind of attire - beautiful one.
    <br>When you leave here, you go to market and buy the same thing.
    <br>We leave here and go to be a copier.
    <br>You move around and see some posh cars, "This is a posh car. I think I need this vehicle.
    <br>Let me take the picture."
    <br>Copy, copy; we have become imitation of man, not imitation of God.
    <br>In religion, in Christianity, in our worship – imitation of man, not imitation of God.
    <br>In our walk - imitation of man, not imitation of God.
    <br>You learn how to smile.
    <br>The way you smile... - why can't you smile?
    <br>You see some of them; you can see the way he walks is not original, not real.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is just what is happening now.
    <br>This has virtually affected our children.
    <br>The new generation today seems to be copies.
    <br>That has affected our relationship with God.
    <br>We now take our faith as a hobby, a game.
    <br>When I move to people to attend to them and hear them talking, you know where they are coming from.
    <br>The Bible is our standard.
    <br>It is just one Bible and the Holy Spirit is just one.
    <br>All over the world, there is one Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Holy Spirit operating here is the same Holy Spirit over there and all over the world.
    <br>As if the Holy Spirit is different - there is so much trouble.
    <br>That actually convinces me that the world is coming to an end.
    <br>With what we are seeing - so much.
    <br>Where do we start from, when people are copies?
    <br>Everything about you...
    <br>You have to study books to know how to pray - a lot of things...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Until we turn to imitate God Almighty, our Creator, we will not stop lamenting.
    <br>That crisis, lamenting, and others...
    <br>No matter how much blessings you have, how strong you are.
    <br>Faith is of man’s heart.
    <br>Every Word of God is Spirit and life and will work in you when you attend and act upon it.
    <br>Take note of that, "Spirit and life".
    <br>Since it is Spirit and life, there is no imitation of man there.
    <br>If somebody comes out to give testimony and says, "Praise the Lord!", you say, "Hallelujah!",
    <br>"When I received my morning water, I sprayed it this way... and I received a big contract";
    <br>you quickly write it down, "I sprayed it this way..."
    <br>Now, you walk towards the morning water to receive your own.
    <br>When you get home, you look at the paper, "I sprayed it this way...",
    <br>"OK - my contract is coming."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Salvation is of man’s heart.
    <br>Relationship with God is of man’s heart.
    <br>OK, now, we are here today.
    <br>You have read your Bible and right from nursery we know what the Bible says.
    <br>“Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.”
    <br>That is the standard; there is no other.
    <br>“Forgive us as we forgive those..." who what?
    <br>"... sin against us."
    <br>It means, let go of all unforgiveness, resentment, anger, bad feelings toward anyone but have you?
    <br>And you are here today to pray.
    <br>You are expecting God.
    <br>“Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.”
    <br>That is the standard; take note.
    <br>It means, let go of all unforgiveness, resentment, anger, bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>But have you?
    <br>No.
    <br>What kind of hypocrisy!
    <br>Where are we going then?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Even if you receive and you have not put behind bad feelings toward anyone,
    <br>you will still lose that blessing.
    <br>You can receive; you cannot go with that blessing.
    <br>At the time you need that blessing you will lose it.
    <br>It is the standard.
    <br>At the time you need this blessing, you will lose it.
    <br>"Give us this day our daily bread."
    <br>What is our daily bread?
    <br>"Forgive us as we..."
    <br>Already, you have committed yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are here for prayer that comes from faith.
    <br>What is prayer that comes from faith?
    <br>Prayer that comes from faith heals the sick.
    <br>Prayer that comes from faith sets the captives free.
    <br>Prayer that comes from faith blesses the poor.
    <br>And if they have sinned, they will be forgiven.
    <br>That is prayer that comes from faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Prayer that comes from faith heals the sick.
    <br>Prayer that comes from faith sets the captives free.
    <br>Prayer that comes from faith blesses the poor.
    <br>And if they have sinned, they shall be forgiven."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is what we are here for.
    <br>We are not just care for prayer for needs; but prayer that comes from faith.
    <br>Before we start; you see - everything is calm.
    <br>You will see people...
    <br>You will now say, "This lady was with me; we talked. What is wrong with her?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is prayer that comes from faith.
    <br>That is, prayer that comes from the heart.
    <br>- Prayer that comes from where?
    <br>- Heart.
    <br>Prayer can only come from the heart when your spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>You want your prayer to come from your heart
    <br>but it is only when your spirit acts upon the Word
    <br>that you have the prayer that comes from the heart.
    <br>Prayer that comes from the heart is prayer that comes from faith because faith is of man's heart.
    <br>This heart consists of offence; you are full of offence.
    <br>Faith does not share the same apartment with anyone.
    <br>God cannot share the same apartment, the same heart.
    <br>But your heart is full of offence, unforgiveness, resentment and anger.
    <br>Your heart is full of bad feelings toward anyone.
    <br>Faith cannot share the same apartment with offence.
    <br>Faith cannot share the same apartment with unforgiveness.
    <br>Faith cannot share the same apartment with anger.
    <br>Faith cannot share the same place with bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>So, what do you want to do now?
    <br>It’s either you choose faith or you choose offence.
    <br>It’s either you choose faith or you choose resentment or unforgiveness.
    <br>This is where we are now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Prayer that comes from the heart – that is, prayer that comes from faith,
    <br>heals the sick, blesses the poor, sets the captives free.
    <br>If they have sinned, they will be forgiven – that is the prayer that comes from the heart.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If they have sinned, and you are praying for them,
    <br>and the prayer comes from faith,
    <br>they will be forgiven instantly.
    <br>That is why you will be healed.
    <br>You cannot be healed without forgiveness because healing is for salvation of your soul.
    <br>If they have sinned, they will be forgiven instantly -
    <br>that is prayer that comes from the heart.
    <br>But your heart is full of offence, unforgiveness, anger, resentment, hurt and pain.
    <br>You may be right but we should not hold offence against anyone
    <br>because if you hold offence against anyone, it will imprison your heart.
    <br>Once your heart is imprisoned, you go nowhere – no relationship with God.
    <br>Can we just stand up and pour our hearts; if there is any pain of the past,
    <br>if there is any bad feeling towards anyone.
    <br>Right now, you can at this moment stand up and tell, "Lord Jesus".
    <br>Reconcile yourself.
    <br>Let go of all unforgiveness.
    <br>Let go of bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>Let go of all resentment.
    <br>In Your presence I am content
    <br>In Your presence there is light 
    <br>Expressions of Your love
    <br>Revelations of Your power and might
    <br>In Your presence I can bring a love song offering
    <br>I’m in the presence of my King
    <br>In His presence, there is nothing like unforgiveness, resentment, anger
    <br>or bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>Freedom, breakthrough, clearance – in His presence.
    <br>Hallowed be Your name
    <br>Lord and Majesty 
    <br>Divine authority
    <br>Hallowed be Your name
    <br>Lord and Majesty 
    <br>Divine authority
    <br>Hallowed be Your name
    <br>Yes.
    <br>As a child of God, you are to walk majestically.
    <br>Offence causes fear – fear of breakthrough, fear of sickness, fear of isolation.
    <br>When you have an appointment, you will be afraid whether they will hold that appointment.
    <br>If you have a clearance and you are asked to come for clearance,
    <br>you will be afraid whether you will receive the clearance.
    <br>When you want to sleep, you will be afraid of nightmares.
    <br>When you want to pray, you will be afraid whether your prayers will be answered.
    <br>Fear has been holding people in bondage.
    <br>The way fear rules people -
    <br>if that kind of fear ruled me, I would run away from Nigeria, because of what you people had done to me,
    <br>because of what you had said to me, what you had done to me - there is nothing you had not done to me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Majesty
    <br>Worship His majesty
    <br>Unto Jesus
    <br>Be all glory honour and praise
    <br>Majesty Kingdom authority
    <br>Flows from His throne unto His own
    <br>His anthem reigns
    <br>So exalt lift up on high
    <br>The name of Jesus
    <br>Magnify come glorify 
    <br>Christ Jesus the king
    <br>Majesty
    <br>Worship His majesty
    <br>Jesus who died now glorified
    <br>King of all kings
    <br>With fear we will continue to swallow our vomit.
    <br>Fear will make you swallow your vomit; you take your vomit back.
    <br>Look at many of us here today, "Over my dead body will I come to Synagogue",
    <br>but we are in the Synagogue.
    <br>No!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is fear.
    <br>What you say you would not do, you find yourself doing.
    <br>When you say you would not go, you find yourself going there, because of offence.
    <br>That offence in our heart causes fear.
    <br>When you hold offence, bad feelings towards anyone, whether the person is right or wrong,
    <br>whether you are right or wrong and somebody abuses or cheats you -
    <br>whatever anyone might have done to you and you hold bad feelings towards him -
    <br>you will continue to live a life of fear.
    <br>You know, you maybe right, and you know something is done to you,
    <br>and you know you are right, and you are holding bad feeling toward anyone...
    <br>When I say ‘anyone’ – the accused and accuser.
    <br>Holding bad feelings toward anyone – you will continue to live life with fear.
    <br>Fear robs us of our blessings.
    <br>You will not be able to give your best.
    <br>That is why we cannot give our best.
    <br>You are always afraid.
    <br>God is not of fear but of love.
    <br>Where are we going and what is the cause of this fear?
    <br>Bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “What is the cause of fear? Bad feelings towards anyone.”
    <br>You say, "Ah, he cheated me. I will not forgive him. He is very bad. I helped him; he dooped me.
    <br>I loaned him money. Hear what this man is saying about me; he calls me thief, he embarrasses me."
    <br>Bad feelings towards anyone...
    <br>You continue to live a life of fear.
    <br>A life of fear is a life of destruction.
    <br>If you cannot believe a man you can see, is it a man you cannot see you will believe?
    <br>If you cannot believe what you can see, definitely, you cannot believe God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You don't believe yourself; when you dream, you have to see many people for interpretation.
    <br>Because you don't believe yourself; there is a promotion in that dream for you,
    <br>"Let me go and ask people".
    <br>Because you don't believe anything good can come from you.
    <br>You say, "My pastor, please, I dreamt about the promotion..." - because you don't believe yourself.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>How do we get out of this mess?
    <br>We get out of this mess by stopping holding what?
    <br>Offences.
    <br>Whether your offence is too big; I don't want to use word 'offence' again.
    <br>Simple: bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>If you say that, you know it covers all.
    <br>For you to get there, where God promised you, bad feelings towards anyone – stop it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You keep singing this song...
    <br>Leave it for God
    <br>Don’t worry yourself
    <br>Leave it for God
    <br>Don’t cry no more
    <br>What is the meaning of that?
    <br>Bad feelings towards anyone; that is the meaning.
    <br>Somebody slaps you, you say, "Why do you slap me?"
    <br>And now, you hold offence; that is bad feeling towards...
    <br>Leave it for God.
    <br>I'm a good example of "leave it for God"; my name is "Leave it for God".
    <br>Prophet "Leave it for God".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is me for you.
    <br>I know what I'm doing.
    <br>You think I cannot fight?
    <br>My name is "Leave it for God".
    <br>I will just look at you and...
    <br>Sometimes, when it is too painful, I will say...
    <br>I will not allow this to affect my future.
    <br>The future is very clear – clear and bright.
    <br>Why should I allow anything to stain that future?
    <br>The only way they can stain it is to attack and insult you.
    <br>Your answer to that insult will stain the future.
    <br>Don't trade anything with what?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don’t ever trade anything with the future.
    <br>Suffer now and enjoy tomorrow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, please...
    <br>"Be patient for the future" - tell your neighbour.
    <br>That is the answer.
    <br>Be patient for what?
    <br>Future.
    <br>We are not patient for the future.
    <br>You are in a hurry.
    <br>"I will answer. No, I have to fight. I have to defend myself." - No!
    <br>A time is coming – your future will answer them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you know the reason I said, “Be patient for your future”?
    <br>Because your future will answer them.
    <br>Unanswered questions – the future will answer.
    <br>There are many things, "How would you defend yourself? How would you answer?" - No!
    <br>If you can be patient, that future will answer your critics.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Be patient – your future will answer your critics.”
    <br>That is when God will set a table before you and every essential of life will be on the table.
    <br>The table will answer your critics but you are not patient for your future.
    <br>Future we are speaking of is not here or there; future is next.
    <br>An hour to come, a second to come.
    <br>Your life can change any moment from now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we say future, people think, "10 years; I cannot wait. I'm still a student, undergraduate,
    <br>I'm unemployed, I don't have job, I'm homeless. What kind of future again?
    <br>How will I arrange my future? I don't know where I'm going. What future this man is talking about?"
    <br>Future belongs to God and future is what we call mystery.
    <br>How it happens – you don’t know.
    <br>It's just this...
    <br>Can you count how many seconds?
    <br>Your future; next is this, next -this...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The glory – many have lost it.
    <br>We have to be frank.
    <br>We got it before and we lost it.
    <br>But God is merciful; don’t give up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you have lost it, that is not the end.
    <br>Please, I want to leave you here.
    <br>In summary:
    <br>please, be patient for your future.
    <br>Your future will answer your critics.
    <br>Your future will answer your enemies.
    <br>Your future will answer your adversaries.
    <br>Because He lives
    <br>I can face tomorrow
    <br>Because He lives
    <br>All fear is gone
    <br>Because I know
    <br>He holds my future
    <br>My life is worth living
    <br>Just because He lives
    <br>Be patient for your future.
    <br>The evidence of coming of your future will make your enemy to surrender.
    <br>They will surrender.
    <br>The evidence is so powerful.
    <br>A stone which a builder rejected will become the real cornerstone.
    <br>That is the future.
    <br>They reject you and call you names because they don’t know what is about to come.
    <br>There is a mystery somewhere waiting.
    <br>Reject you; this is how God does it.
    <br>He always allows enemies and critics to embarrass because of what is coming.
    <br>Be patient for your future.
    <br>This is the time you should expect embarrassment.
    <br>This will prepare you for the future.
    <br>Embarrassment will prepare you for the future.
    <br>Name-calling will prepare you for the future.
    <br>Whatever you are going through is to prepare you for the future; be strong.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>So, what you are going through is to prepare you for the future.
    <br>Pleasure cannot prepare you; pleasure will destroy you more.
    <br>This is not the time to talk of pleasure.
    <br>You want to be strong -
    <br>you need much of hard times, less of good times to prepare you for the war.
    <br>Unless you have arrived. 
    <br>Have you arrived?
    <br>No.
    <br>What are you talking about?
    <br>You have not yet arrived.
    <br>You are still struggling and striving.
    <br>This is the right time to go through what you are going through -
    <br>sickness, hardship, name-calling, rejection, isolation.
    <br>This is the right time.
    <br>They will prepare you for the future; you will become stronger.
    <br>Your struggles will make you stronger.
    <br>- Hallelujah.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Give thanks to God, give thanks to Him.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Take note – be patient for your future.
    <br>Your future will answer your enemies.
    <br>Your future will answer your critics.
    <br>The evidence will be overwhelming!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you believe you are too old for the future I'm talking about; God is prepared to add more to your age.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Begin right now to let go of all unforgiveness, bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>Anyone means accused and accuser.
    <br>Bad feelings - "I have bad feelings towards this man. The man is wicked. The man has dooped me.
    <br>No, I don't want to hear his voice. That is his number - delete it."
    <br>It will imprison your spirit and you need a free spirit to relate with God,
    <br>to relate with the Holy Spirit because your spirit will join itself.
    <br>When your spirit is imprisoned, how will you relate with God?
    <br>From this moment, make yourself available.
    <br>In your heart first, settle yourself.
    <br>Even your critics will not know that you have forgiven, but your heart - you have nothing.
    <br>One day, when they come across you, they will know that you are for them.
    <br>You are not against.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is how you will begin to prepare for your future.
    <br>It is like someone, who is about to wed, and the celebration is next week,
    <br>but he is fighting people now.
    <br>They may likely kill him before that time.
    <br>They will likely kill him.
    <br>When you are celebrating; you know your celebration is next week,
    <br>anything like fight comes your way - you will know that it is a work of an enemy.
    <br>I will be wedding next week, "Look! This is a work of an enemy."
    <br>You stay cool and calm, because you know that something is about to come.
    <br>What is about to come is why the enemy is doing all this.
    <br>They want to destroy what is about to come.
    <br>That is exactly your future - your life.
    <br>What you are doing now; if you don't let go of all your unforgiveness,
    <br>one will likely be destroyed before the future comes.
    <br>One may not die, but one will be on the sick bed.
    <br>One may not die, but one will have a disease and sickness that will make the future not enjoyable.
    <br>One will not die but one would be in the prison yard.
    <br>A lot of things happened like that.
    <br>By the time the future comes, they say, "Oh, you are destroyed already."
    <br>We go to the future, not that the future comes to us.
    <br>Not that you sit down and say, "Future come!" - no, you will go to future.
    <br>With forgiveness, humility, love, faithfulness, you will go to the future.
    <br>Let someone say, “My future is coming!”
    <br>When you say your future is coming – your arrival, your settlement, your clearance.
    <br>Then, many will depend on you.
    <br>Many will depend on you, so many will depend on you.
    <br>My future is coming.
    <br>Let go of all offence.
    <br>My future is coming.
    <br>If you don’t let go of all offence, it will affect that future.
    <br>Your future will continue to be postponed.
    <br>Don't be surprised; by the time one gets there, they will open the file and show you,
    <br>"You are a king but you spent all your life on the street.
    <br>You are a president of a country but you spent all your life at the garage.
    <br>You are destined to be very rich but you spent all your life begging on the streets" - you will just see it in the file.
    <br>They will be telling you what you are destined to do.
    <br>You are destined to be rich, to be president of a country, to be this, to be that,
    <br>but they will open the file, "Look at yourself; you are begging, you are a beggar."
    <br>You will say, "Ah!" - you will be very surprised, that what you were destined to do
    <br>is different from what you went to do.
    <br>Because of offence, fight, disagreement, bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>There is no way God can communicate with you.
    <br>He can only communicate with you through your heart, your spirit
    <br>but your spirit is full of offence, unforgiveness, anger, resentment, bad feelings toward anyone.
    <br>This is why many people today, when they realize that there is no way to go because of bad feeling,
    <br>they join cults, secret societies; they can do anything.
    <br>So, please.
    <br>Begin to believe in God’s authority now because you believe so much in majority.
    <br>Get yourself right with God; you can now move with the majority.
