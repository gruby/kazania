    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ukeme Essien.
    <br>I was trained by Exxonmobil on oil and gas production operations.
    <br>Since I completed the training in December 2007,
    <br>I had not have a job for six years.
    <br>I have been everywhere, went to so many companies
    <br>I did so many interviews and medical check-ups
    <br>but there was always an excuse why I wasn't given the job.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN in April this year.
    <br>When I came, I got the Anointing Water and anointed myself.
    <br>That was on Sunday, 7th of April.
    <br>I had this overseas connection that refused to be picking my calls.
    <br>It is a recruitment organisation.
    <br>Immediately after anointing myself on that Sunday,
    <br>on Monday morning, at 7:24 am on the 8th of April,
    <br>I received a call from overseas,
    <br>telling me that they wanted to see me in the United Arab Emirates
    <br>for a face to face interview.
    <br>They paid my ticket, they did everything for me for free
    <br>and they lodged me in a 5-star hotel, in Abu Dhabi.
    <br>Only 35 people were invited for the interview from all over the world.
    <br>Only two people were from Africa among those 35 -
    <br>myself and another guy from Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>When they called me for the interview, I excused myself to the toilet.
    <br>When I got to the toilet, I used the Anointing Water and.
    <br>Mr. Ukeme Essien
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>I sprayed the Anointing Water all over myself until I almost emptied the bottle.
    <br>I said that as soon as they saw my face, they should see favour.
    <br>I didn't want them to ask me any question I didn't know.
    <br>If they asked me any question I didn't know, they should answer it.
    <br>One of the interviewers looked at me because I was the least among the 35.
    <br>He looked at me again and again and I could read his mind.
    <br>It was like: "What is this small baby doing here, where adults are gathered?"
    <br>So, they called me in.
    <br>As soon as I opened the door and came in, the people there started laughing.
    <br>It was as if they had known me before.
    <br>I was scared, thinking that they were drunk or something.
    <br>Any little thing I said, they would laugh and become very happy.
    <br>They interviewed me for one hour.
    <br>For every answer I gave, they told me to go deeper and explain more.
    <br>The only question I didn't know the answer for -
    <br>I spent 10 seconds trying to think about it - they answered it for me.
    <br>So I knew that the Anointing Water was at work.
    <br>They took me for a medical check-up.
    <br>When I got there, there was an announcement
    <br>that if you were more than 45 years old, you should come for another check-up.
    <br>When I saw people sitting with me I joined them to stand up.
    <br>When I got there, the American doctor that was doing the check-up told me,
    <br>"Go and sit down, you are a child. I am talking about adults."
    <br>Everybody started laughing at me.
    <br>At the end, they gave me this appointment letter.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I am entitled to a brand new car every two years.
    <br>The payment is well over 14 million naira.
    <br>That is my payment, what they will pay me.
    <br>And they also gave me a very big house, with a rent of 4.7 million naira.
    <br>I decided not to hide such a testimony.
    <br>I said I should come and share it, to the glory of God.
    <br>They made me the field services foreman,
    <br>which is the head of all the technicians.
    <br>So, I thank God.
    <br>Praise God.
    <br>Which company?
    <br>The name of the company is Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations.
    <br>It's an oil company, this is their clinic where they did my medical check-ups.
    <br>This is the five star hotel where they lodge me.
    <br>What were you doing before,
    <br>from the level you were before to this new level?
    <br>Tell us.
    <br>Before now, I was just moving around, teaching in secondary schools.
    <br>On the streets?
    <br>Yes, and they were paying me 8000 Naira per month.
    <br>No, look! Don't say this in public.
    <br>Part time teaching - in the evening he would go to school and teach the children.
    <br>From morning to evening he would be moving in the streets roaming about.
    <br>8000 to millions.
    <br>Mr Ukeme Essien
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>This is what I heard from God when I was given this Anointing Water.
    <br>The transformation will be so great.
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>Look, brother, to go on and on, your first salary -
    <br>you should only take the money you need for transport and food.
    <br>Take it and look round for the less privileged and raise their standard.
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>After that, you can begin to remove money that will not affect you, your living.
    <br>Remove it and put it down and continue to take care of the less privileged.
    <br>If you do that, in six month you will be transferred
    <br> from this place to another place.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Be a good citizen as you are going.
    <br>Please, be a good citizen.
    <br>The name of your country, please - it is very dear.
    <br>Thank you, man of God, I am very grateful.
    <br>What is your advice to the whole world and the people that are still there, where you are coming from?
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>First and foremost, I am grateful to the man of God.
    <br>I want to advise everyone that the Anointing Water is one stop shop.
    <br>Once you get the Anointing Water, whatsoever is the problem - it's over.
    <br>You can imagine; I was the only person that was selected from Africa.
    <br>It was just like that; I knew nobody there. 
    <br>The Anointing Water made me great.
    <br>I give God all the praise!
    <br>Amen! Thank you, thank you!
