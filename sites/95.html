  <p>    
    <br>Evangelist C.S. Upthegrove, legendary revivalist, prolific author, prominent minister of God and one of God's generals
    <br>has ministered the Word and power of the Almighty God all over the globe for sixty-eight years.
    <br>He was born into a humble family in Florida, USA - the second youngest of twenty-one siblings.
    <br>Upthegrove began preaching the Word at the young age of fifteen.
    <br>Since that time, for nearly seven decades he has travelled the world
    <br>with the message of hope and salvation that Jesus Christ is the Lord to untold millions around the globe.
    <br>Evangelist C.S. Upthegrove personally knew and ministered with some of the most renowned of God's generals in the last century,
    <br>including R.W. Schambach, Jack Coe, Oral Roberts, Katherine Kuhlman, William Branham and A.A. Allen.
    <br>After many years of faithful discipleship under A.A. Allen, in 1965,
    <br>C.S. Upthegrove was divinely appointed as his successor and the new pastor of A.A. Allen's church -
    <br>Miracle Valley International Revival Centre, in Arizona, USA.
    <br>This enabled A.A. Allen to focus on his vision of reaching a wider international audience through crusades.
    <br>Here is the footage of that historic event.
    <br>This time, it is my happy privilege to bring to you the man that God has raised up with the supernatural ministry of deliverance,
    <br>Reverend A.A. Allen.
    <br>I believe that God has an angel today that is going to trouble the waters
    <br>for your healing and for the healing of the nations.
    <br>Jesus Himself will trouble the waters for the healing of the nations.
    <br>Prayer has been going up to Heaven
    <br>as to who would be the pastor of this great International Miracle Revival Center.
    <br>God answered prayer yesterday and the Holy Ghost spoke in His own way and told us what to do about this.
    <br>I am about to introduce the new pastor of Miracle Valley International Revival Centre,
    <br>who is also going to be very instrumental in seeing that you and your loved ones receive your healing.
    <br>Because hundreds of people here and thousands around the world are going to be praying day and night
    <br>that God would send the angel to trouble the waters for your healing.
    <br>So, the pastor of Miracle Valley Bible Training Center,
    <br>Miracle Valley International Revival Center and Bethesda Healing Faith Clinic
    <br>is none other than Rev C.S. Upthegrove from West Palm Beach, Florida and he is preaching.
    <br>Come on, let's give him a hand!
    <br>Here is the man who God has sent, Brother Upthegrove.
    <br>Thank you, Brother Allen.
    <br>Welcome to Miracle Valley International Revival Center,
    <br>the best church in the world. Can you say, "Amen!".
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You know, there is a big question facing our world today and the church world.
    <br>I am going to preach an hour's message in five minutes! Amen.
    <br>The big question is where has revival gone? Where is the joy?
    <br>Where is the peace? Where is the happiness that belongs to the church?
    <br>I believe that in the last few days, God has revealed to Brother Allen
    <br>the answer to revival for the church today.
    <br>Every revival that has ever been known to man from the time that God first placed man in the garden until this day
    <br>has come not through denominational walls or by man made ideas, opinions, creeds, doctrines and genealogies
    <br>but it has come by the direction of the Spirit of the Almighty God.
    <br>God is doing something today, I believe, in the heart of A.A. Allen that is going to stir this nation and this world.
    <br>During this great convention and camp meeting, God spoke to Brother Allen and said, "I am going to do a new thing."
    <br>All through the ages, new things have been done by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
    <br>and the new thing that God is going to do in this world today is to bring back joy,
    <br>beauty and what belongs to the church.
    <br>The world is getting sick and tired of 'preacherettes' preaching 'sermonettes' to 'Christianettes'.
    <br>All over the world today, we have got thousands and thousands of church members
    <br>but church membership is not the answer.
    <br>What this world needs today is not churchgoers but going churches.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>There was a time when God chose to heal through Simon Peter merely by the shadow.
    <br>God has chosen to heal and work in various ways.
    <br>God has healed through a handkerchief; God can heal through a prayer cloth.
    <br>God can heal through a shadow, the anointing of oil or the laying on of hands.
    <br>But God said, "I am going to start a new thing."
    <br>Brothers, in this revival, convention and camp meeting, God began a new thing.
    <br>People brought their prayer cards to the front, saying,
    <br>"I don't need them anymore. God has healed me! I am healed!"
    <br>If you believe God is doing a new thing, everybody stand to your feet with me.
    <br>Let's raise our hands and praise God!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Lord Jesus, as we raise our hands and praise Thee,
    <br>on this telecast going across this nation,
    <br>I pray Lord that You would move with Your Spirit, power and love,
    <br>in Jesus' name!
    <br>I pray that You would stir up the minds of the people to see that what we need is joy and happiness
    <br>to bring back the miracles that belong to the church.
    <br>We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen!
    <br>The ministry of Evangelist C.S. Upthegrove has been characterized by the miracles, signs and wonders,
    <br>promised to follow a true believer of Christ, in Mark 16:17-20.
    <br>Countless people have been touched, healed, delivered, blessed and come to the knowledge of God's saving grace,
    <br>through the anointing of God upon his life.
    <br>Now, eighty-four, he is still active in the ministry and is dedicated to reaching as many souls for Christ as he can.
    <br>God's general, Evangelist C.S. Upthegrove.
    <br>I am C.S. Upthegrove and I have a message for you, right here in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Keep watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>You will be blessed!
