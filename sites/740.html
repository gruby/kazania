    <br>I want everyone to go on your knees for your country, continent and nation
    <br>and cry to God for redemption.
    <br>Now, it's everywhere.
    <br>Everywhere.
    <br>Dry bones shall rise again!
    <br>Whatever spots, whatever challenges - there is no single nation without challenges
    <br>and the challenges are causing uproar.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and say to the Lord,
    <br>"Here we are on our knees with humility, with all our heart.
    <br>I pray for my nation. I pray for countries. I pray for continents - troubled ones.
    <br>Father, come at this time and intervene."
    <br>Prayer For The Nations With Prophet T.B. Joshua

    <br>We're praying against 
    <br>War in the whole world
    <br>We're praying against
    <br>War in Africa
    <br>We're praying against 
    <br>The wrath of God on all our land
    <br>We need God's intervention
    <br>In the whole world
    <br>God's intervention
    <br>God's intervention
    <br>In the whole world

    <br>We need God's intervention
    <br>In the whole world
    <br>You've got the whole world
    <br>In Your hands
    <br>Don't forget the nations that rescue nations - they too are facing their own challenges.
    <br>Open your lips for prayer.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Don't forget the nation, Nigeria. There's peace - that is why we're here today.
    <br>Pray for the leaders and the nation. Thank you. Hallelujah!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Hallelujah. Thank you very much. Rise up!
