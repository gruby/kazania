  <p>    
    <br>The New Morning Water released the presence, the power and the glory of Jesus Christ
    <br>into the lives of all who received even just a drop of it.
    <br>Demonic beings, hidden sicknesses and the plan of the devil against the lives of so many people
    <br>were broken and cast out in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>A glorious liberty began to replace years of oppression and bondage.
    <br>Holy relaxation replaced the years of tension and pressure God's people had endured through the ministration.
    <br>Watch the mighty deliverance of this woman through the New Morning Water.
    <br>Holy Ghost fire all over her body !
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ !
    <br>Now, speak out! Who are you ?
    <br>Who are you ? Speak out !
    <br>She came to me because she wanted to give birth.
    <br>That's why I entered her - she had to give birth. I entered her through her culture.
    <br>She begged me. She said, "I want to give birth. Please, have mercy on me".
    <br>Who are you ?
    <br>She has to slaughter a goat.
    <br>I am the spirit from the mother.
    <br>You evil spirit !
    <br>You can't destroy me.
    <br>Listen!
    <br>I have destroyed her family; the family is useless.
    <br>Now listen to me, you evil spirits!
    <br>All of them are useless.
    <br>What are the bad habits?
    <br>She has nothing now; she is a drunkard.
    <br>She is my wife; she is my woman - I made her useless.
    <br>What are the bad habits you have given her?
    <br>She is my woman.
    <br>She drinks and she smokes.
    <br>Anytime she drinks what happens to her ?
    <br>Even if you go to her hotel now, there is more - she bought more.
    <br>She is my woman; you can't take her from me.
    <br>She begged me.
    <br>Listen, in Jesus' name! Any time she smokes and drinks, what happens to her ?
    <br>What happens when she starts drinking and smoking ?
    <br>She goes crazy; she drives - she wouldn't know where she is going.
    <br>She always drives.
    <br>You spirit of drunkenness, what else have you caused this woman to do ?
    <br>What else ? Speak out !
    <br>What else have you caused her to do in her life ?
    <br>Speak out! Fire all over your body, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ !
    <br>Spirit of drunkenness, what else have you caused her ?
    <br>What else ? Speak out!
    <br>She smokes - she can smoke 20 boxes a day.
    <br>Then who are you in the body ?
    <br>I'm her man; she stays alone because I take care of her. I give her money.
    <br>I do everything for her; she is my woman.
    <br>Who are you in this body ?
    <br>She is my woman.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am the spirit from her mother. It is because she begged me.
    <br>Okay, for how long have you stayed inside her ?
    <br>She begged me !
    <br>10 years now !
    <br>She is a sangoma. Did she tell you she is a sangoma ?
    <br>She has a shrine house at her mother's place. Did she tell you that ?
    <br>She is a sangoma.
    <br>She has a shrine?
    <br>She went to inyangas for help; non of them - they failed to help her.
    <br>What have you done to her ?
    <br>Did she tell you that she did abortions ?
    <br>She is a sangoma; she used to consult people.
    <br>She has a shrine house; she has everything by her mother's house.
    <br>Okay ! You spirit, it is time for you to leave this body !
    <br>This lady will live !
    <br>I will kill the family.
    <br>You will not kill the family.
    <br>If I'm going out now, I will go to her through one of my friends.
    <br>Now you are leaving!
    <br>And you will never return to that family in the mighty name of Jesus Christ !
    <br>It is time for you to leave this body in the mighty name of Jesus Christ
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus !
    <br>You are free.
    <br>You are set free through the medium of the New Morning Water in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now rise up. You're free. Rise up and give thanks to God.
    <br>Jesus Christ has set you free !
    <br>Thank You, Jesus ! Thank You, Lord !
    <br>I've waited so many years for this. Thank You. I had to quit my job to come here.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus !
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I'm healed and free !
    <br>My name is Refilwe. I'm 34 years old. I'm from South Africa.
    <br>The reason that brought me to The SCOAN: It was sangoma spirit - the witch doctor,
    <br>which I trained for in 2012.
    <br>Ok. So just tell us how you got involved in the issue of becoming a sangome.
    <br>What led to you being initiated into this ?
    <br>I had a business before. I was running my own saloon business.
    <br>Things didn't go well, it got messed up.
    <br>So I had to go to a witch doctor for consultation - to tell me what my problem was,
    <br>why my business was now failing and why my life was not in order.
    <br>After going to the witch doctor for consultation, she told me that I must train to become a sangoma.
    <br>That I had a gift in healing people so I must become a sangoma.
    <br>I then asked what the procedure was for becoming a sangoma, what had to be done.
    <br>He said to me, "Ok, you must give a sacrifice before coming for the training.
    <br>You must slaughter a goat
    <br>and then you will tell your ancestors that you'll train to become a sangoma.
    <br>Then I went to tell my parents that I went to see a witch doctor
    <br>because of in my family they didn't worship ancestors.
    <br>They used to go to church.
    <br>I told them, "The traditional healer told me this is a matter of life and death.
    <br>I must do it in order to have money.
    <br>And you guys (parents) are going to have money and benefit from this.
    <br>So I'm going to heal you. It will benefit the family".
    <br>So, they accepted it. I slaughtered a chicken.
    <br>Then I begged my ancestors, "This is my offering, I need to go for the training now".
    <br>Then I went for my training. I paid money - a lot of money, not a small amount of money.
    <br>It cost more than fifty thousand to do the training
    <br>because from time to time, you must offer sacrifices, you must slaughter.
    <br>All the time you have to offer sacrifices.
    <br>During my training, they taught me how to read bones, and how to use charms.
    <br>They taught me about different charms like this is for marriage. This is for business. This is for work.
    <br>If a person has a problem, struggling to get a job, you must use this charm, so that this person can get a job.
    <br>When you graduate, you go to the water.
    <br>We went with a goat there. When they slaughter the goat, you must open your mouth.
    <br>You drink the goat's blood and then someone will pour it on your body.
    <br>And then you talk to the spirit of the water and go inside the water.
    <br>There is an underworld secret which not everybody knows about. You go inside the water.
    <br>It's a dry land and you sit there.
    <br>That's how you receive your things, your bones, your ancestors' clothes, and your beads.
    <br>After the water graduation...
    <br>Then I went home. When you go home, then you graduate. That's how you become a sangoma.
    <br>You are ready to heal people. You are ready to consult people.
    <br>People come to you with different types of illnesses, problems in their lives.
    <br>So how did you begin to practice as a sangoma after this initiation ?
    <br>After your graduation, you'd start to practise.
    <br>You burn the essence which will attract people to come to you for consultation.
    <br>Then you stow your bones, you read the bones while the people are coming to your shrine.
    <br>Okay, sister, we want you to explain very clearly to us.
    <br>What you are saying right now - the confession you are giving - is your own personal experience.
    <br>You personally went through this initiation process, and began practicing as a sangoma
    <br>after you drank the blood of this goat, went into the water to be initiated, to collect the bones and other items
    <br>that you'd use to practice and that's how you started work as a sangoma. Is that right?
    <br>Yes, that's right. That's correct.
    <br>I started training - initiating like consulting people.
    <br>Give us an example of how you would go about it when people would approach you?
    <br>Okay, people would come to my  forefathers' house for consultation.
    <br>I would then take them to the shrine house.
    <br>Then they would tell me, "My name is so-and-so".
    <br>They wouldn't tell me their problem because I had to figure out what their problem was.
    <br>I had to throw down the bones and tell them what the problem was,
    <br>what brought them there. Then I would tell them, "This is the problem. You are facing this and this".
    <br>In order for me to tell them, I had to first talk to my ancestors,
    <br>"My ancestors, I have this person so and so. He has come here to consult. Please assist me".
    <br>I would hear voices in my ears.
    <br>Then they would start to tell me, "Okay, tell the bones that this is the problem of that person.
    <br>This is the charm that must be given to that person in order for that person to be okay".
    <br>You were practicing this for several years.
    <br>You were part and parcel of this - tell us, the people that would come to you with problems,
    <br>by the time you actually gave them a charm, what would end up happening to those people?
    <br>The charm would not work. People would follow me and tell me that they still had the same problem.
    <br>I would tell them, "Ok, come back. Let me take you to the stream, so that you can bathe".
    <br>I would consult my ancestors, "The person has phoned me again, the problem is still there.
    <br>The problem is not resolved. So what must I do now ?"
    <br>They would say, "Take the person to the water so that she can bathe with a chicken.
    <br>She must sacrifice a chicken and then things will be fine".
    <br>But the problem would still be there for that person. Eventually that person would not come back to me.
    <br>Okay, so the people that came to you with problems, after everything, collecting money,
    <br>consulting for them, the problem would still continue and even if not, would become worse.
    <br>Yes, the problem would still be there for those people who came to me.
    <br>You that was practicing as a sangoma, what was happening in your own life at this period?
    <br>In my own life I never had peace, my life was falling apart.
    <br>I myself needed help.
    <br>I would go to other traditional healers, to seek traditional doctors to help myself.
    <br>I was busy consulting people, but I myself needed help.
    <br>As you worked as a sangoma, what finally happened in the midst of this?
    <br>Okay.
    <br>I had a dream that they told me that I must go and do training inside the water.
    <br>I must go to the ocean. That's how they would lead me inside the water.
    <br>I must stay there for two years. Then I would come out as a powerful person.
    <br>I told myself, "No, I can't go there. What if I don't come back. I have kids to look after. I have family. I can't".
    <br>That's how I decided, "NO! This is not worth it".
    <br>I have struggled. I went from one witch doctor to another witch doctor to another - nothing!
    <br>Then all that slaughtering of goats, offering sacrifices every time, I had to beg and talk to a goat,
    <br>"Goat, please give me money. Goat, please help me. Goat, please I need this".
    <br>Every time, month to month, chicken, goat, chicken, goat...
    <br>I was tired of that life.
    <br>So, people of God, I hope we are listening to our sister's experience.
    <br>Especially for those who in the past have visited witch doctors, consulted sangomas.
    <br>This person speaking to us now has practical experience as someone that practiced in this,
    <br>and at the end of the day realized that everything came to nothing.
    <br>Now, sister you are mentioning some of the processes of initiation.
    <br>Could you just explain to us with the pictures here, what we are seeing here to verify what you're mentioning.
    <br>Okay. Here as you are looking.
    <br>This is where I drank the goat blood.
    <br>They poured the goat blood on me.
    <br>So, that you can accept your ancesters. That you are now officially a witch doctor.
    <br>Here, I went to the altar to beg the spirit of water, the mermaid.
    <br>Sometimes, these spirits come in different types - crocodile, mermaid or snake.
    <br>This is where I went to the water to beg the spirit to help me open my things in the ocean.
    <br>This is my shrine house where I practiced as a witch doctor.
    <br>This is me here when I did my sangoma dance, wearing this outfit and undergoing my training.
    <br>We also want to understand: When you were practicing as a sangoma,
    <br>were you also in a relationship with someone or did you get married at this period ?
    <br>Yes, I was married. The spirit made me choose between my marriage and them.
    <br>So. I had to leave the father of my kids because I was scared.
    <br>They said I will die and my family will be in trouble if I don't do this.
    <br>So you left your husband to worship these ancestors and to continue your practice as a sangoma?
    <br>Yes, I did.
    <br>Were you not permitted to have any relationship?
    <br>And what was happening to you in your dreams at this period concerning relationships ?
    <br>When you are a sangoma, especially when the spirit of a man enters you,
    <br>you won't have any feelings for men - only feelings for women.
    <br>I never told any of my friends that I was attracted to women.
    <br>I would watch women. I would be more attracted to women than men.
    <br>Because this spirit did not allow you to have a man in your life, that gave you affection to your fellow females.
    <br>Yes, even when I had a man in my life. I wouldn't have feelings for him.
    <br>I would never have feelings for that man.
    <br>You said it reached a point where you were told that you would have to go underwater
    <br>for two years to go through training, to increase your powers as a sangoma.
    <br>When you heard this, what step did you take after that ?
    <br>I told them, "No, I can't. I'd rather lose everything. I'd rather lose my life.
    <br>I can't do it. I'd rather take my life. I can't do it. I'll go to church. I can't do it.
    <br>I'm tired of you". I spent more than fifty thousand, hundred thousand,
    <br>going from one traditional healer to another. The problem would still be the same.
    <br>There was no solution for me.
    <br>So after you stopped doing the work of a sangoma, what began to happen to your life?
    <br>How did the spirits of sangoma now begin to destroy your life?
    <br>After that, I became a heavy smoker. I was a drunkard.
    <br>I'd drink from Monday morning until the next day. I'd drink at work, during working hours.
    <br>I'd sneak out from work to go drinking and smoking.
    <br>My life was going down the drain. There was no (hope).
    <br>I didn't have a life. So, I thought my life was over for me.
    <br>I'd take 12 or 6 a day - a whole box.
    <br>I would smoke - if I didn't smoke, I would shake.
    <br>I'd shake hard, "Let me go out to smoke!"
    <br>Even when I arrived here in Nigeria, people were looking at me at the airport,
    <br>"You are such a beautiful lady but you are smoking".
    <br>I was like, "They have to mind their own business. They don't know me.
    <br>I smoke. I'm a smoker".
    <br>Ok, so you were a chain smoker, a chronic smoker,
    <br>and you also took between 6 to 12 bottles of alcohol every day.
    <br>Yes
    <br>Ok, now. Today, we can see you here in The SCOAN.
    <br>Could you just tell us in the midst of this, how did you discover the ministry and what led you to be here today?
    <br>I went with my boyfriend to his friend's place. I was so drunk that night.
    <br>As we entered that friend's house, on top of the TV, I saw the New Morning Water.
    <br>So you saw a bottle of the Morning Water on top of the television of this friend.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>At this point, did you know anything about the Ministry of Tthe SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua or the Morning Water?
    <br>No, I didn't know anything about them.
    <br>When I saw the water, I took the bottle - this friend went to take a shower.
    <br>And then I asked myself, "What is this?" I looked at the bottle and kept on asking myself that question.
    <br>Then I sprayed myself and put that bottle back on top of the TV.
    <br>Then I kept quiet, I remained seated.
    <br>You said that at this period, you were completely drunk.
    <br>I was completely drunk that night when I saw the New Morning Water.
    <br>So, after spraying myself, my boyfriend came back and said,
    <br>"Refilwe, you must go home now. It's late". Then I went home.
    <br>When I got home and then woke up in the morning, I was like, "Huh? What's going on with my body?"
    <br>It was like I was dreaming, like something just went out of me. I was a new person.
    <br>I couldn't understand what was going on. I phoned my boyfriend, "Elvis, please I need that water.
    <br>I saw that water by your friend's place. Please, where can I get that water? Please!"
    <br>He said to me, "Refilwe, you can't get that water. You must go to Nigeria, SCOAN, Emmanuel".
    <br>I asked, "Who is Emmanuel? What is SCOAN? What is that?"
    <br>He said, "Please, when you have time, you must come and we'll talk. I'll explain everything to you".
    <br>So you knew immediately that it was that Morning Water you used
    <br>that caused the change in your body when you woke up the following day?
    <br>Yes, because the water delivered me.
    <br>God didn't judge me when I was drunk. That water delivered me when I was so drunk.
    <br>So it was the following morning when you woke up, that they introduced you to the MInistry.
    <br>You learned that you can only get this Morning Water here in Nigeria.
    <br>So, how did you manage to be here today?
    <br>Every day at work, I researched about the Church, passport and visa, and how to get it.
    <br>And then I finally made it here,
    <br>Okay. Before you made it, what was the last challenge you faced,
    <br>especially in your workplace before God enabled you to be here last week?
    <br>Okay, the first challenge - there were two roads.
    <br>Money or deliverance of my life.
    <br>I had to choose between those two roads. Then I prayed to God,
    <br>God, I've suffered for many years. This job, this money is nothing to me.
    <br>I'd rather quit this job and go for my healing and my deliverance.
    <br>I rather take Your road. Money will come after. At this stage, I don't care about money.
    <br>My deliverance is more important than money".
    <br>So, at your workplace, you were given an ultimatum that either you leave the job or you travel
    <br>because you wanted to travel without permission from your job.
    <br>So you had to take a critical decision at that moment.
    <br>Yes, it was a critical decision because I have bills to pay.
    <br>I'm a single parent.
    <br>I have kids. I have family (to take care of).
    <br>My rent is so expensive. I prayed, "God, You will see me through. I lack no faith.
    <br>I trust in You that You will come through for me. I'm quitting this job because I put my trust in You".
    <br>Amen, that's how you came straight to The SCOAN.
    <br>Now, tell us, sister - can you describe what happened to you last week,
    <br>as the evangelists were moving around ministering the New Morning Water.
    <br>What happened at that period?
    <br>When they were ministering the New Morning Water on me, I was feeling like my intestines were burning.
    <br>It was like I was burning inside.
    <br>I asked God, "What is going on? I'm burning!"
    <br>It was like something just went out of me.
    <br>Now I can see the light of God.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ !
    <br>It's been one week after your wonderful deliverance.
    <br>Can you just testify to the changes you've seen in your life?
    <br>I thank God, I'm saved.
    <br>My life is more important than money. I thank God because He saved me.
    <br>I turned in my cigarette packets to one of the workers here,
    <br>That was on Monday after the touch from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Okay, so you mean to say that these were the cigarettes you came with to Nigeria,
    <br>because as a chain smoker, you were smoking a packet every day.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But after your deliverance, what happened?
    <br>After the deliverance on Monday, I handed them to one of the workers here.
    <br>So you mean, since last week till today, you have not touched...
    <br>No alcohol. No smoking. I'm clean.
    <br>And you no longer have that urge?
    <br>You said before, that your body would be shaking and desiring to smoke, to drink.
    <br>That urge is completely gone now?
    <br>Yes, I'd crave. I'd shake if I didn't smoke.
    <br>I used to shake when I didn't smoke and drink, but now I don't have that urge anymore.
    <br>My body is healed. I'm free, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ !
    <br>So what are you going to do with these cigarettes now?
    <br>Throw them away!
    <br>It is history! It will never repeat itself!
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time !
    <br>Now, sister, we believe you're in a position to really advise our viewers all over the world.
    <br>A lot of people are still having the belief that perhaps if they visited a witch doctor or spiritualist,
    <br>they would be helped in one way or another.
    <br>But you're here giving your own life experience, testifying to the world that you were once a sangoma.
    <br>And every attempt you made to get help yourself failed during that period.
    <br>Even the people you thought you were helping actually were only being destroyed.
    <br>So what is your word of advice to our viewers?
    <br>Especially those who are still patronizing such places?
    <br>Ok, my word of advice is to the youth, because spirits are now tormenting the youth.
    <br>Especially in my country, and other countries as well. I say to them,
    <br>Please, there's no such thing as ancestors. It's only demons that are playing with your mind.
    <br>Go to the house of the Lord, to God. At the end, God will come through for you.
    <br>As God has come through for me, He will come through for you.
    <br>Leave these things, because the end is bad. The sangoma thing brings poverty, death in the family,
    <br>misery, and pain. Please! I advise especially the youth,
    <br>Don't be fooled by these traditional healers, witch doctors.
    <br>Stick to the Word of God because Jesus is alive !
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony continues
    <br>My name is Refilwe. I'm 34 years old. I'm from South Africa.
    <br>The reason that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was suffering from the spirit of sangoma.
    <br>God finally came through for me. I managed to come to The SCOAN to get my deliverance and healing.
    <br>After all these years I had suffered from these spirits, I thank Lord Jesus because He came through for me.
    <br>Today I'm here, and I'm grateful to God, for what He has done for me.
    <br>After my deliverance, I can feel a lot of changes in my body.
    <br>As I have mentioned in my testimony , the worst of all was that I had to quit my job
    <br>because the deliverance in my life was more important than money.
    <br>God has already given me another position. I got another job, and I can't wait to go home,
    <br>to start a new life and start a new job.
    <br>You mean after you gave your testimony, you actually received employment in another position?
    <br>After you lost your job to come here, you now have another job ?
    <br>Yes, I now have another job. God has given me a better job.
    <br>It's with a company that I've been praying for all these months to work for.
    <br>So now I've gotten that opportunity from God.
    <br>I'm going to return to my country to start my new life, my new job.
    <br>In a couple of months, I'm going to open my new business.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ !
    <br>And all of that - your past life, the spirit of smoking, drinking, everything is gone.
    <br>I don't have that craving anymore. Everything just disappeared. I'm a new person now.
    <br>I'm ready to kick in - in life.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. We thank God for your life, sister.
    <br>And we're here today with a message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>The man of God said he wants to really support you, as you are going back to start your new life now.
    <br>We know you really went through a test of faith before coming here to The SCOAN.
    <br>You persevered, you overcame and today your life is a living testimony
    <br>So Prophet T.B. Joshua said he wants to support you with this gift of 1,000 US dollars.
    <br>It is from Emmanuel TV partners and the prophet for you to really get going in your new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>I am so happy. God has done it again. I thank you, Man of God, for the second gift.
    <br>The first gift was that you brought me inside the church, gave me free food and free accommodation.
    <br>I thank you for that. May the Lord bless you in the name of Jesus !
    <br>I thank you. And now this money! You saw that this lady (me) needed this money.
    <br>I thank you, Man of God. I thank you. May the Lord continue to bless you !
    <br>I thank you so much. I thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah. Thank You, Jesus Christ, once again.
    <br>We can see our sister overcome with joy at this wonderful blessing she's received.
    <br>This is 1,000 US dollars and the Word of God - The Mirror.
    <br>What can you say, sister?
    <br>I am so excited!
    <br>I didn't expect this !
    <br>I thank God. I thank You, Lord. I trusted in you.
    <br>That's why I had strong faith before I came here.
    <br>I said, "God, I know You'll never fail me. I know You'll never let me down".
    <br>I trusted in You from the minute I entered that plane. I thank You, Lord Jesus. Thank You so much !
    <br>Hallelujah ! Wow, indeed a million thanks are not enough.
    <br>Finally, sister, what is your word of advice to our viewers ?
    <br>My word of advice today is especially to the youngsters.
    <br>The witch doctor training things, the sangoma training things, they target mostly the youngsters.
    <br>There is no such thing as sangoma, ancestors - they are just demons.
    <br>They are just demons that will eat your money. They will finish your money.
    <br>Once they're done with you, they are through with you, then you'll become nothing.
    <br>I've learned that. I've been there. I have accepted Jesus now.
    <br>So, I want the youngsters to please follow the Word of God.
    <br>The Word of God takes you to the end.
    <br>The world of ancestors is just a meantime life.
    <br>Once they are through with you, you'll never be the same again. Thank You. Lord Jesus Christ !
    <br>We thank God for that word of advice. It is really born of life experience from our sister today.
    <br>She is victorious in Christ and her past is over and we give all the glory to God.
    <br>We believe she'll be coming back very soon with even more wonderful testimonies to share,
    <br>and we want to encourage you to continue to go forth, make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and we believe the best is yet to come in Jesus' name !
    <br>Amen. I thank You, Lord Jesus !
    <br>Thank You for healing me. Thank You for everything You have done for me !
