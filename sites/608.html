    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The Lord gave me a message about relationship - we need to talk about this
    <br>because there are so many broken homes; talking of your partners, business partners, friends -
    <br>broken relationships.
    <br>Therefore, let's talk about that and see where the Lord will lead us to today.
    <br>I will take you to the Book of 1 Corinthians 13.
    <br>"If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels but do not have love,
    <br>I am only a resounding gong...
    <br>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
    <br>and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
    <br>If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,
    <br>but do not have love, I gain nothing."
    <br>Love is the greatest of all.
    <br>If you go to verse 4 there, it says:
    <br>"Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy..."
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>It means those who are envious lack love.
    <br>Who has love among us then?
    <br>I read again verse 4.
    <br>"Love is patient..."
    <br>Are you really patient?
    <br>We are patient; that is why we are where we are today.
    <br>If we were not patient, from church 1, we would have abandoned the church.
    <br>The first church was destroyed by rain.
    <br>The second church was destroyed by storm.
    <br>The third church was destroyed but with patience we believed we would be somewhere.
    <br>The Bible is saying, "Love is patient, love is kind."
    <br>We understand 'kind' - anybody can pretend to be kind,
    <br>but to be patient - it is very difficult to be patient.
    <br>We are in a generation without love and without patience.
    <br>Everything you are using is as a result of impatience.
    <br>You want to eat - you have a gas cooker.
    <br>As a result of impatience, there is traffic everywhere.
    <br>"It does not envy..." - that is, love does not envy.
    <br>What could make one envy?
    <br>When you are not content.
    <br>As we are sitting, some people are looking around to see some hair styles, attire.
    <br>As we are talking now, some are at the car park, "Oh, this car is beautiful. I must get it."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>"... it does not boast..."
    <br>That is love.
    <br>When I say relationship -
    <br>relationship exists where there is love.
    <br>We are not talking of the kind of relationship today - with a little trouble, you quit.
    <br>You can't stand the consequences.
    <br>Unless when the goings are good, you are there, "I'm your friend".
    <br>Not that kind of relationship.
    <br>Relationship exists where there is love.
    <br>Love cannot exist without relationship.
    <br>Here we are today, from east, south, west; different countries are gathered together here.
    <br>Even though some of us pretend to be here today...
    <br>Maybe you are looking for your business partner - that is why you are here.
    <br>Some are looking for... "How are you? Fine."
    <br>"They say in that church they deliver people. I will be here sitting down.
    <br>I'm going to marry the first lady they deliver."
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>Different reasons...
    <br>You know the reason why you are here.
    <br>All over the world we gather together.
    <br>This is why the Lord says, Christianity is a relationship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Christianity is a relationship.]
    <br>Christianity is a relationship.
    <br>You come from here, you come from there.
    <br>Sometimes you sit with your gardener who normally cannot even look at your face,
    <br>but now is side by side with you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Christianity is a relationship."
    <br>When you look around, you will see the managing director, the head of the company,
    <br>being an usher, cleaning the church together with a gardener - all together.
    <br>Where can this happen?
    <br>Christianity is a relationship.
    <br>This is why we don't have any special seat for anybody here.
    <br>Everybody has the same kind of seat.
    <br>When you come first, you sit in the front.
    <br>First come, first out.
    <br>Christianity is a relationship; it is not a religion
    <br>where we prepare a seat; when you are not there, your children can take over the seat.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not a religion.
    <br>Love cannot exist without relationship and relationship exists where there is love.
    <br>Can you see where you sit?
    <br>Look at the person sitting beside, behind you, or in your front.
    <br>You will find that it may be someone, who out there cannot look at you.
    <br>Maybe it is someone who cleans your shoes,
    <br>but because Christianity is a relationship - yes!
    <br>As Christians, we should realise that all about relationship originates from God.
    <br>Relationship begins with God and overflows to people.
    <br>RELATIONSHIP BEGINS WITH GOD
    <br>As a Christian, our relationship with friends, relations, others
    <br>must remain an integral part of God's original relationship.
    <br>If your relationship is not from there, then we can't talk of might and power.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your relationship with others -
    <br>others can be friends, relations, family, church members, your pastor -
    <br>must remain an integral part of God's original relationship.
    <br>Even in the face of adversity, long suffering, affliction, just name them,
    <br>because relationship originally comes from God, you have no power to quit unless God releases you.
    <br>"This man duped me, insulted me, embarrassed me" -
    <br>because of that you quit.
    <br>Without God releasing you, you quit because of trouble.
    <br>That is not God's relationship.
    <br>The Bible says we must stay put and get used to the situation in order to obtain spiritual maturity.
    <br>Whatever happens between you and your friends,
    <br>stay put and get used to the situation in order to obtain spiritual growth and maturity.
    <br>Spiritual growth is a function of obedience to God
    <br>just as physical growth is a function of time and intellectual growth is a function of learning.
    <br>We must stay put and get used to the situation.
    <br>You cannot quit from a relationship unless God releases you.
    <br>Once trouble comes, you disconnect yourself - you quit.
    <br>No matter the trouble, no matter what happens, you quit.
    <br>But the same friend may be your messiah tomorrow
    <br>or messiah of your children.
    <br>That you are wrong today does not mean you cannot be a messiah tomorrow.
    <br>That you are not perfect today does not mean you cannot be perfect tomorrow.
    <br>You keep running from this or that.
    <br>Many of us, when you enter many offices,
    <br>you will find that the head of the company is someone who has injured you in the past.
    <br>And you need help.
    <br>By the time you see the person, "I'm sorry".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The way we leave a relationship is the same way we will enter into the new relationship.
    <br>Jesus said in John 20:23, if you forgive the sin of anyone, they are forgiven
    <br>and if you retain the sin of one, they are retained.
    <br>If you leave a relationship embittered and resentful, with hatred, fight,
    <br>you will enter the next relationship with the same attitude.
    <br>The unforgiveness you hold for your former relationship will hinder your future.
    <br>It is impossible to establish a healthy relationship with a person who had left a relationship embittered,
    <br>because of hatred.
    <br>It is impossible to establish a healthy relationship with such people;
    <br>even though he or she may claim to have forgiven, it was not forgotten.
    <br>You may claim to have forgiven him, your boss or former friends;
    <br>it was not forgotten.
    <br>Love forgets wrong so that there is hope for the future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As a Christian, take note of this word of exhortation.
    <br>If you are in the place where God wants you to be, the devil will do everything to dislodge you -
    <br>I mean, to displace you out of the relationship with the people there.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives the devil's attack.
    <br>Either it is a marriage from God, or business, or church - just name it.
    <br>If you are in the place where God wants you to be, the devil will do everything to dislodge you.
    <br>It is a sign.
    <br>When the devil knows that you are in a place where God wants you -
    <br>this is your destiny in your hands -
    <br>he will fight you with all he has to dislodge you,
    <br>to displace you out of the relationship with the people there.
    <br>By thinking, "I am out of touch", you are giving the devil a chance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"I'm out of touch."
    <br>When later you are touched, you begin to misjudge yourself,
    <br>"I'm a Christian now. Why should all this happen to me?"
    <br>Anything can happen.
    <br>The devil wants to uproot men and women from the place where God plants them.
    <br>Where God plants you is where the devil wants to uproot you from.
    <br>When you finally get to where God wants you to be,
    <br>the devil will do anything...
    <br>But for you to stand the devil, you must not think that you are out of touch.
    <br>When it comes, you know it is a sign.
    <br>When attack comes in your marriage, remember this message,
    <br>"Yes, this must be the marriage God wants me to be in".
    <br>That attack is to displace you out of relationship,
    <br>to dislodge you out of the relationship; it happens to many today.
    <br>There are "marry and remarry".
    <br>Seventy percent of homes today keep divorcing and divorcing...
    <br>I pray you see that the attack you are going through
    <br>is an object that separates impurities.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The attack I'm going through,
    <br>the situation I am in is an object that separates impurities."
    <br>Are you a believer?
    <br>If yes, whatever situation you are going through right now, is an object that separates impurities,
    <br>is a refiner of character, is a builder of character.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What situation are you going through?
    <br>Are you sick?
    <br>That you are a Christian does not mean you cannot be sick.
    <br>A Christian may be sick in body and yet, a friend of God.
    <br>Are you poor?
    <br>That you are a Christian does not mean you cannot face hardship.
    <br>A Christian may be poor and yet, a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>I ask God to strengthen you so that you can praise God and not complain.
    <br>I ask God to strengthen you so that you can press on when it seems all is over.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your situation as a Christian is an object that separates impurities,
    <br>is a refiner of character,
    <br>is a builder of character.
    <br>Your belief is because you are a Christian now, you are out of touch.
    <br>If your relationship with your neighbour, friend still remains an integral part of God's original relationship...
    <br>Relationship begins with God and overflows to you.
    <br>RELATIONSHIP BEGINS WITH GOD
    <br>Any relationship that begins with God, comes from God, does not quit unless God releases you.
    <br>"You are released to leave that relationship, marriage.
    <br>Leave the marriage." - you hear from God, not because of the situation in the marriage.
    <br>We don't leave marriage because of the situation in the marriage.
    <br>We leave marriage because God says, "Leave!"
    <br>We don't leave business because of trouble.
    <br>We have to leave the business because God wants us to leave.
    <br>But look at your life today;
    <br>everything you have left behind...
    <br>You had many businesses you had done in the past.
    <br>You left many business partners because trouble came - you left the place.
    <br>No, we don't leave a relationship in the face of adversity; we don't leave unless God releases us.
    <br>This is why today you can't get any good relationship anymore;
    <br>you left this one because of hatred and the new relationship you are going to have -
    <br>that hatred will continue to follow you.
    <br>Healing must take place.
    <br>That is why when you see a woman that left home because of fight, disagreement, misunderstanding,
    <br>the one she will marry tomorrow, that trouble will continue to follow.
    <br>The same thing she left behind will follow her.
    <br>The way we leave a relationship is the way we enter into a new relationship.
    <br>Nearly ninety nine percent here find themselves guilty of this offence.
    <br>You left your former business because of trouble.
    <br>You are not the author of relationship.
    <br>It is the relationship that overflows from God that comes to you.
    <br>It is that relationship that continues.
    <br>If you want God to be involved in your relationship, you must carry Him along;
    <br>you must follow the ethics.
    <br>The relationship from Him - it must be connected.
    <br>You can see what is happening today.
    <br>You are looking for the best - you can see what you have found today.
    <br>Love forgets wrongs so that there is hope for the future.
    <br>The only way Christian character grows is by facing and dealing with problems and difficulties.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"The only way I can grow is by facing and dealing with problems and difficulties."
    <br>That is the only way you can grow.
    <br>But you are running from the very thing that will bring strength, that will promote you.
    <br>Without difficulties and problems you cannot be promoted.
    <br>Those are tests.
    <br>If you are looking for a little problem, you will get a little promotion.
    <br>Big problem - big promotion.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The trials and difficult circumstances we face are for our obedience to God.
    <br>All the time, you want to hear, "Breakthrough!"
    <br>When you are sick, it is time to say, "Jesus be cursed".
    <br>You don't want to be sick.
    <br>If you are not sick, how will you appreciate your good health?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If I am not sick, how will I appreciate my good health?"
    <br>If you have never been sick, you will live a very bad life; there is nothing you cannot eat...
    <br>If you have never been poor before, you cannot manage the wealth.
    <br>When it comes after you were poor, you will know how to manage the wealth.
    <br>It is the experience we learn from that hard time that will actually give us management sense,
    <br>when finally the wealth comes.
    <br>I know you are in a situation because there is no Christian...
    <br>You would get to Heaven to see such a Christian.
    <br>The Bible says, in this world, there will be trouble.
    <br>Cheer up; I have overcome.
    <br>He says to you, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>It means, there is war coming.
    <br>As a Christian, whatever situation you are in, see it as an object that separates impurities.
    <br>To separate impurities means, when you face problems as a Christian,
    <br>you pray the more, you fast the more, call God the more, know and appreciate God the more.
    <br>Situation separates impurities - to refine your character.
    <br>By the time a smoker gets to the doctor, the doctor will say, "You have cancer".
    <br>He says, "Doctor, what is the cause?"
    <br>"You are a smoker. I'm seeing you - in five days, you will die."
    <br>"Doctor, what do I need to do?"
    <br>"Stop smoking."
    <br>"It is over."
    <br>I have decided...
    <br>What separates impurities?
    <br>Cancer.
    <br>Whatever you are going through - it is hard to call this situation a friend.
    <br>In the actual sense, it is a friend because it is an object to draw you closer to God.
    <br>We are separating impurities so that God's character in us can continue to grow.
    <br>Rise up and let us pray.
    <br>Ask God to give you courage to hope and not give up.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Lord, Jesus, give me courage enough to hope and not give up.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Ask God to strengthen you to praise Him and not complain.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Ask God to strengthen you to praise Him and not complain.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>As a Christian, whatever situation you are in -
    <br>that situation separates impurities.
    <br>Can't you hear Paul?
    <br>He said three times he met the Lord.
    <br>The Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you".
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>He was having a thorn in his flesh.
    <br>He run to God the first time and God said, "No, My grace is sufficient for you".
    <br>It means God was using that as a refiner, builder of character.
    <br>Oh my God, I like that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He said, "When I'm weak, then I'm strong.
    <br>When I have pain, then I have peace" - I like that.
    <br>"When I'm not happy, than I'm happy."
    <br>It means there are two sides: here is sad and here is happy.
    <br>This we call "check", "foil".
    <br>To check you.
    <br>You appreciate God more.
    <br>You need something to make you appreciate what you have.
    <br>Just like when you see people without limbs,
    <br>you ask yourself, "Look at this man on the bed. How does he eat? How does he sleep? Cancer all over".
    <br>But you see yourself, "I'm OK. I laugh, talk, move, eat freely.
    <br>Look at someone - he cannot walk, eat, sleep".
    <br>You say, "God, thank You."
    <br>Just as you see every day those who are looking for what you have already.
    <br>As you are looking for something somebody has,
    <br>so also, somebody is somewhere looking for what you have.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>See life in that way.
    <br>You are saying, "I have not eaten today".
    <br>Now, you see someone who has cancer of mouth,
    <br>and he has money, he has everything.
    <br>To eat, they have to pass food through somewhere here.
    <br>Are you not going to say, "Thank You, Jesus"?
    <br>Although I have no food, but I have a passage to eat it.
    <br>Here is a man; he has money, everything, but there is no passage to pass...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The prayer you need now:
    <br>Ask God to strengthen you to praise Him and not complain.
    <br>I want to praise God and not complain.
    <br>Open your lips - prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is the prayer we need at this time:
    <br>God, strengthen me to keep pressing on when it seems all is over.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>God, strengthen me to keep pressing on when it seems all is over.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Ask God, give me grace, grace enough to stop misjudging myself no matter the situation
    <br>because my situation does not determine my Christian life.
    <br>I may be sick, yet, I am a Christian.
    <br>I may be poor, yet, I am a Christian.
    <br>I may be in a situation, yet, I am a Christian.
    <br>My situation does not determine my Christian life.
    <br>Prayer!
