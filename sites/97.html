    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>During the Sunday service, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave encouraging words of wisdom from the Word of God,
    <br>that uplifted and edified all.
    <br>As directed by the Holy Spirit, the man of God moves in the midst of the people prophesying into their lives.
    <br>As a communicator between the visible and the invisible, Prophet T.B. Joshua gives accurate words of prophecy
    <br>and exposes the root causes of their problems and points them to their future success
    <br>through the wisdom and power of God.
    <br>As the man of God prophesies, a woman cries out for his attention.
    <br>Please. No, come.
    <br>Don't send her away please.
    <br>Wait.
    <br>Go and sit down; I will see you.
    <br>Hearing From God - Woman Walks Out of Wheelchair | T.B. Joshua
    <br>Please, can you carry her there?
    <br>It is purely ignorance.
    <br>You have to correct them.
    <br>She believes that when she cries, I will abandon the other people here;
    <br>that people who are not crying do not have problems.
    <br>People who cry have problems, right?
    <br>Okay, let's cry!
    <br>Hearing From God - Woman Walks Out of Wheelchair | T.B. Joshua
    <br>Now, you sit calmly.
    <br>Okay, don't worry. Come.
    <br>It's alright. Stand right.
    <br>Man of God, help my mum! She can't walk!
    <br>Hearing From God - Woman Walks Out of Wheelchair | T.B. Joshua
    <br>What could cause her to continue to cry out in such a persistent manner?
    <br>Can you carry her? Let her go and sit in front of the altar. She is my guest.
    <br>After instructing her to wait, the man of God continues to give words of prophecy to the people,
    <br>and within no time the woman cries out for a third time.
    <br>She cannot walk.
    <br>We are all the way from Tanzania, Man of God!
    <br>- Where is your mother?
    <br>- She is in the carpark.
    <br>Go and bring your mother.
    <br>Hearing From God - Woman Walks Out of Wheelchair | T.B. Joshua
    <br>The woman wastes no time and runs out of the auditorium to the overflow congregation
    <br>to bring her mother to the man of God,
    <br>after explaining that she was from Tanzania and her mother is unable to walk.
    <br>She hastily makes her way to where her mother is waiting, believing that God Almighty would touch and restore her
    <br>through His anointed servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Upon reaching one of the overflow canopies outside the church auditorium,
    <br>the woman locates her mother, who is seated in a wheelchair
    <br>and it is obvious that she is unable to walk or move around without the wheelchair.
    <br>They slowly make their way back to the man of God in the auditorium.
    <br>What is going to happen next?
    <br>Will this woman be able to walk again?
    <br>Hearing From God - Woman Walks Out of Wheelchair | T.B. Joshua
    <br>You don't see what I am looking at.
    <br>You know I don't do anything unless I hear.
    <br>That is why the whole thing works for good.
    <br>If I don't hear from God, I don't attempt it.
    <br>But this is emotional.
    <br>She cried out, not that God asked her to cry out.
    <br>What will I do now?
    <br>In the eyes of many, if I don't attend to this woman, that may affect your faith.
    <br>You may begin to ask, "Is there anything God cannot do?"
    <br>And I don't want anything to affect your faith.
    <br>But I have not heard from God.
    <br>Can we wait to hear from God?
    <br>If I don't attend to this woman, it will affect a lot of people's faith.
    <br>Now, I don't want anything to affect your faith, but the matter is that I have not heard from God.
    <br>Shall we wait and hear from God?
    <br>If I don't hear from God, there is nothing I can do.
    <br>The man of God explained that he is not the healer, and as a servant of the Healer, Jesus Christ,
    <br>he cannot do anything without clear instruction and guidance from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When I listen to the suggestion of the Spirit, I get it accurately.
    <br>But if I want to do it on my own, by idea, it will fail.
    <br>Like the woman in the wheelchair, I have not heard anything from God.
    <br>If I continue to say, "In the name of Jesus", I will just tell you, "Tomorrow you will walk. God home and come back."
    <br>I am not God; I am a servant.
    <br>The challenge we are all facing in the church,
    <br>the one we do not hear from God is more than the one we hear from God.
    <br>We say ten things not from God but one from God.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Because of the thousands of people who are looking at us, I appeal to God.
    <br>If your case is possible -
    <br>look at the thousands of people who are outside; look at the people here.
    <br>Look at everybody. It will affect the faith of many today.
    <br>Many will believe Jesus is Lord.
    <br>Just because of that.
    <br>Not because of me; not because of you.
    <br>Just because of establishment.
    <br>Just because of that, we want Jesus Christ to pray for this woman.
    <br>Father.
    <br>- You believe.
    <br>- Yes, I believe.
    <br>I pray your faith will heal you today.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>- You say you believe.
    <br>- I believe.
    <br>What is the evidence and proof that you will be healed?
    <br>I think I will be healed because I have used a lot of money and a lot of time to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>She believes she will be healed because she has spent so much money and she has suffered.
    <br>And we don't get healed because we have suffered.
    <br>We don't get healed because we have spent so much money.
    <br>We get healed because, "By His stripes."
    <br>Let me help your faith.
    <br>Father, thank You.
    <br>The man of God stretches his hand and prays for her to rise and walk in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>proving that the age of miracles has not passed,
    <br>that the Master Healer Jesus Christ is alive and that He still uses the faculties of His servants
    <br>to express His power and bring glory to His name by making the impossible possible.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Hearing From God - Woman Walks Out of Wheelchair | T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank You, God! I am healed!
    <br>Thank You, Lord! Thank You, Jesus! My mum is healed!
    <br>The man of God instructs her to rise and walk in Jesus' name and instantly she rises to her feet and walks,
    <br>waving her hands thankfully to God for this awesome miracle.
    <br>Let's listen to her testimony.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Navone.
    <br>I come from Tanzania.
    <br>I am 57 years old.
    <br>The problem which brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>was lumbar spondylosis which had affected me for almost three years.
    <br>I was not able to walk.
    <br>I used a wheelchair and lumbar corset
    <br>which helped me when I wanted to move from here to there.
    <br>When I was on my way to The SCOAN after I reached Addis Ababa,
    <br>I used my wheelchair and they helped me.
    <br>There was a person who was assigned to help me.
    <br>Then I came to Lagos. I also found a person who was assigned to help me.
    <br>I used my wheelchair and I reached a hotel in Lagos.
    <br>I found a hotel where I have been staying for the past two weeks with my wheelchair.
    <br>I went to several hospitals in my country,
    <br>starting from the district hospital, the regional hospital and the referral hospital.
    <br>At last, they told me I must have an operation on the 1st of July.
    <br>After getting that information, I was worried about having another operation
    <br>because I had already had two operations.
    <br>Therefore, I decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I had the thought that this would be my last bus stop.
    <br>And it has happened!
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>I received prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Then I found that my legs were light and that they could walk.
    <br>I feel that they are so light and I can move!
    <br>As of today, I am now moving! Thank the Lord!
    <br>On my way to Tanzania, I know people are waiting for me.
    <br>Many people are waiting for me and they will be happy to see me walking!
    <br>I am happy! Praise the Lord!
    <br>I know my mum can now walk by herself!
    <br>Tell us for how long has momma been using this wheelchair.
    <br>It had been for about three years.
    <br>For six months, she had not been able to go anywhere.
    <br>We had to support her with the wheelchair.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Unto the Lord be the glory
    <br>Great things He has done
    <br>Great things He has done
    <br>Greater things He will do
    <br>Unto the Lord be the glory
    <br>Great things He has done
    <br>Great things He has done
    <br>Greater things He will do
    <br>Unto the Lord be the glory
    <br>Great things He has done
