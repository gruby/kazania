    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Maiki Ohashi.
    <br>I am from Japan.
    <br>I want to thank God for delivering me from my addiction.
    <br>I was a chain-smoker; I used to smoke a lot of cigarettes.
    <br>I could not think well.
    <br>Every time I was doing something, I would make mistakes.
    <br>It affected me very badly.
    <br>At what age did you start smoking?
    <br>I started smoking when I was 14 years old.
    <br>I just tasted it and from that day, I always wanted to smoke every day.
    <br>I used to smoke three packs a day.
    <br>And each pack contained how many sticks?
    <br>Twenty sticks.
    <br>So you would be smoking sixty sticks of cigarettes every day?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>For how many years?
    <br>It all started in 2010 - when I started chain-smoking.
    <br>I would always cough so hard.
    <br>My mind was always thinking.
    <br>I always made mistakes in my job and at home.
    <br>In 2014, I touched the screen and prayed along with T.B. Joshua in our house.
    <br>When I touched the screen, immediately, my arms became stiff.
    <br>I didn't know why but I couldn't move my arms for about 30 minutes.
    <br>Afterwards, my arms became normal and I fell asleep.
    <br>When I woke up, I tried smoking but the taste was not good anymore.
    <br>I didn't like smoking anymore.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I threw all my cigarettes in the trash can.
    <br>So, since that day, you threw away all the cigarettes you had in your house,
    <br>and since that day, you stopped smoking completely?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>After that, do you still have the urge to smoke?
    <br>No. Even if I am in an environment where people are smoking,
    <br>I don't have the urge to smoke anymore.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>At my place of work, they were confused at what had happened to me.
    <br>I could work and think well.
    <br>It boosted my confidence at work and they have trust in me now.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My advice to people: We cannot stop an addiction on our own.
    <br>We have to go straight to Jesus Christ
    <br>and ask for the Holy Spirit to deliver us from all addictions in our lives.
    <br>Only Jesus can heal us.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Yes, indeed, wonderful advice: Only Jesus can.
    <br>Brother, we thank God Almighty for your life
    <br>and we pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this wonderful deliverance
    <br>that God has done in your life,
    <br>by making God's Word the standard for your life, in Jesus' name.
