  <p>    
    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>All spirits that wander, surround, torment you, your life -
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say to that spirit, "Leave my people!"
    <br>In whatever way demon is connected to you - be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever chain - chain of affliction, be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to loose that chain.
    <br>Disconnect yourself.
    <br>Break!
    <br>You know yourself and you know all avenues satan is using to disturb you.
    <br>You satan, loose your grip!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Tell satan, "Leave my people!"
    <br>I say, leave that woman!
    <br>Leave that man!
    <br>Leave my children!
    <br>Demon is behind every unpleasant situation - I disconnect it from your life.
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Wherever that disease in your blood is, I command that fibroid out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Command that disease - command them out!
    <br>There is fibroid.
    <br>Open your lips, command them out.
    <br>There is power in the name of Jesus.
    <br>There is power in the blood of Jesus.
    <br>Command that disease out!
    <br>THERE IS POWER IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS!!!
    <br>There is fibroid flushed out from the body of that woman.
    <br>My name is Blessing Omoroghewa.
    <br>I am from Italy, Rome.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was multiple fibroids.
    <br>I have been watching Emmanuel TV and seeing the miracles.
    <br>I said, I must come here on my own.
    <br>They booked me for an operation two years ago.
    <br>The same thing happened last year but I refused.
    <br>I said, I must come here.
    <br>Today, when the man of God was praying, I was feeling discomfort in my stomach.
    <br>We give glory to God.
    <br>That is the fibroid flushed out of the body of that woman.
    <br>There is no pain anymore. I am OK.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! At last!
    <br>I am free! No more operation.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Blessing Omoroghewa
    <br>Mass Prayer Testimony
    <br>After Blessing gives her testimony, due to the severity of blood caused by the fibroids,
    <br>she makes her way to the restroom to clean up herself
    <br>and upon getting there feels that all is not over.
    <br>She requests for a bowl.
    <br>Compared to Jesus Christ, healing is not a big deal.
    <br>Truly, there is power in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Now, Blessing is fibroid-free.
    <br>To God be all the glory.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Blessing Omoroghewa.
    <br>In 2015, I started having strange pain in my lower abdomen, anytime I was in my cycle.
    <br>I went to the doctor.
    <br>They tested me and said I should go for an x-ray.
    <br>I went for an x-ray.
    <br>They told me I had multiple fibroids and I had to have an operation - that was in 2015.
    <br>I refused - I would not do an operation.
    <br>Whenever I was in my cycle, I felt a lot of pain and a lot of blood was coming out of me every month.
    <br>Most of the time I could not wear tight clothes.
    <br>I would be very uncomfortable.
    <br>I refused the operation because I have been watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I used to see a lot of miracles that the Lord is doing for people here.
    <br>I said my case can never be an exception - I must be here.
    <br>I came all the way from Italy, Rome to this place.
    <br>On Sunday, as the man of God was praying, I was feeling cuts on my stomach.
    <br>It was really painful.
    <br>Eventually, I saw that blood was just gushing out where I was sitting down.
    <br>I had to rush to the toilet.
    <br>I was so amazed.
    <br>I give glory to Almighty God.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ - the Miracle Worker.
    <br>Can you tell us, at that moment during the mass prayer,
    <br>when the man of God declared that fibroids should come out,
    <br>what happened to you, what did you experience in your body?
    <br>Fibroid came out with a full force and I rushed to the toilet -
    <br>a lot was still coming out with a full force.
    <br>But now, I am really free.
    <br>I give glory to God.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>Can you touch your stomach and tell us if you are still feeling any pain?
    <br>No. I am really OK.
    <br>I thank God. I am OK. I am fine.
    <br>I can wear tight clothes - I don't feel any pain anymore.
    <br>Glory to God.
    <br>This is the first x-ray from 2015, when they diagnosed multiple fibroids in me.
    <br>This is the second one, done in 2017.
    <br>They told me that I had to do an operation, that it was very big.
    <br>Otherwise, I would not have children.
    <br>We thank God for your life.
    <br>Can you tell us what advice do you have for people watching you all over the world?
    <br>My advice to the whole world is to have faith in God and put their trust in God.
    <br>My hope was only in God, I was not having anything other in my mind.
    <br>I said, "I must be here. I will never give up. I must give my testimony on Emmanuel TV."
    <br>And today, I am here, testifying to the glory of God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I am grateful.
