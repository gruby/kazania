    <br>Man of God, help my daughter!
    <br>Man of God, help my daughter! She has deformed legs.
    <br>I also have myopia.
    <br>Ministration Of Healing & Deliverance - Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>My name is Yuleisy; I come from Dominican Republic.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>This is my daughter and my husband.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>Since my daughter was small, she had a problem with her legs.
    <br>I took her for many therapies but the doctors always ended up recommending supportive boots
    <br>because she would constantly fall down.
    <br>Now, I can see the miracle God did in her life.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>The malformation of her legs happened in the womb, as my womb was small and she was big.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>Because she constantly fell down, her legs were always cut and bruised.
    <br>Before, her feet would twist inwards while walking but now, she is fine.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>What did the doctors say about the problem she was having?
    <br>The doctors said that she would always have to wear special boots unless there was an improvement.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>These are the straps that were used to turn her feet outwards; I always made her wear them.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>She would always turn her feet inwards like this and when she walked, she would always fall.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>Do you mean that after the prayer, she has not worn these boots for walking or running?
    <br>She no longer wears the special boots.
    <br>I know and believe in the miracle God did through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>She does not fall any more; she is now very well; she can run, play and enjoy the environment.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>I am very grateful to God and to the servant of God that He used.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>Can you please tell us your name?
    <br>Jameli.
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>Four years.
    <br>I used to fall.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>Now, how do you feel after the Crusade?
    <br>I'm fine!
    <br>Do you fall down?
    <br>No.
    <br>Healed Of Leg Problem
    <br>No Longer Using Special Boots
    <br>How are you feeling?
    <br>Fine!
    <br>You should believe because God still performs miracles through His servants.
    <br>LITTLE GIRL WITH DEFORMED LEGS STARTS RUNNING!!! 🏃‍♀️
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>I am going to throw them away!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
