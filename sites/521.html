    <br>Prayer Line At The Mexico Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>You are into witchcraft and you destroyed so many men.
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Witchcraft from the ancestors".
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I came from the ancestors".
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I have done many things to her. We are many witches".
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Seduction through the eyes".
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Many. A spirit of hatred".
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>The evil spirit says, "She is bad".
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The demon now defeated flees, as Prophet T.B. Joshua resists it by faith, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME

    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Right now, the sister who received her deliverance during the first day of the Mexican Crusade
    <br>is here to share her wonderful testimony, alongside her husband.
    <br>My name is Madeline Gutierrez.
    <br>I come from Mexico city.
    <br>I had the spirit of witchcraft from my ancestors. I used to practice witchcraft.
    <br>I used to perform fetish rituals. I was into occultism.
    <br>I had so much hatred towards men.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>I had the power of seduction in my eyes. I would make men fall into temptation.
    <br>I would harm and destroy men.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>In my family, they would cut off their legs and then cross them, giving them the power to fly.
    <br>They would call them witches of fire.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>My grandfather used to talk with satan.
    <br>On the street, my grandfather would perform rituals, walking backwards
    <br>and satan would appear to him and speak to him.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>My grandfather told me that with the power in his eyes, he would kill many animals.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>When I was growing up, I started to experience that power in my eyes to manipulate people.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>I also had aunts who did the same thing - they would cut off their feet and start flying.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>One of my aunts made a covenant with a black goat.

    <br>At the age of 15, I was already interested in occultism.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Through a jar, I would talk to the spirits of people I wanted to harm.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>I would scream at them every three hours - one at 12, 3, 6, 9 and at midnight.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>When I was growing up, I would travel astrally out of my body and join evil forces to curse people.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>I would call them and put my hands on their heads and in their hearts to do evil to them.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>You said that you had power in your eyes to seduce men. How did you seduce them?
    <br>I would seduce and sleep with men.
    <br>Then, I would take their fluids, mix it with mine and rub it on their temples and scalps.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>What would happen to those men?
    <br>I would hurt and destroy them emotionally and enjoy seeing the suffering in their hearts.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>I would destroy them emotionally and after that, they would resort to taking drugs and alcohol
    <br>and they would keep looking for me.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>You mentioned that you did astral travel and that you would destroy people spiritually.
    <br>Can you tell us, the people that you met physically, what would happen to them?
    <br>They were people I knew physically and if they didn't like me or mistreated me,
    <br>I would start to think about them and wake up at 3 am to watch them sleeping at that moment.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>What would happen to them physically?
    <br>I caused poverty. I destroyed marriages. Whatever I desired in my heart would happen to them.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>The testimony that you are sharing is to give thanks to God for your deliverance and to educate people.
    <br>We would like to know what happened to you when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.
    <br>I felt a fire. The prophet completely exposed the evil spirit that was in me.
    <br>I was searching for deliverance. I didn't want to stay captive anymore.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>I feel very happy. Now, I can look into all of your eyes.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>God is Almighty - the One who has delivered me from everything.
    <br>God loves everyone. Don't lose faith.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Don't allow yourself to get out of faith. Ask God for more anointing and more wisdom.
    <br>Stay focused on the Word of God because there are so many evil women who come to churches without you knowing.
    <br>Truly, God Almighty has set me free.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Indeed, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>We know, just as satan used the sister here to destroy so many people, countless people,
    <br>her confession and testimony right now will be used to save millions of people around the world.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Edgar Natan.
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>The testimony is that our lives have completely turned around.
    <br>When we would meet as husband and wife, I began to realise that she was demon possessed.
    <br>My pastor advised me that I should cover myself with the blood of Jesus.
    <br>Even when I would cover myself, she would tell me not to cover myself and would ask if I was afraid of her.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>The changes that I noticed was based on the word that the prophet shared on Friday about love.
    <br>And then, on Saturday when I arrived home, I saw a radical transformation in my wife and in our conception of love.
    <br>Mexico Pastor's Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Wow. Thank You, Jesus. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Once again, we give all the glory to God and we pray that God would give the grace to our wonderful couple here
    <br>to continue to stay close to Jesus.
    <br>And we know that better is not good enough, the best is yet to come in their lives, in Jesus' name.
