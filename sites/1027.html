  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, I know you are ready and the Spirit of God is much around to set us free.
    <br>He has descended already.
    <br>How He will remain - think about that.
    <br>Begin to talk to yourself. How He will remain - that is our challenge.
    <br>He does not remain in us when He is grieved.
    <br>I told you about offence.
    <br>When we hold a grudge against our brother, we have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Whatever offence in the past, whatever pain in the past, it is time now to let go.
    <br>You have to do that now - before you receive.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, whatever you are doing,
    <br>it is time now to let go of offence, pain of the past, unforgiveness.
    <br>Right now, let go!
    <br>I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>From that pain of the past, you are disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Unforgiveness - you are disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to disconnect yourself.
    <br>You need a free spirit right now!
    <br>Begin to disconnect yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>We say to that affliction, there is no hiding place; leave my people!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>You affliction, leave my people!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Wherever you are - are you in a coma?
    <br>The Owner of your soul is commanding you to rise up!
    <br>You affliction, leave my people!
    <br>Leave their blood, kidneys, liver, bones!
    <br>I command you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself -
    <br>your weakness -
    <br>your weakness could be your anger, pain of the past, unforgiveness;
    <br>whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself, right now, begin to disconnect yourself.
    <br>Disconnect yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Satan, leave my people!
    <br>I command you, in the name of Jesus, leave my people!
    <br>You have no role; you have no right.
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>I tell you, you have no role; you have no right!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Leave their health, finances, business, marriage, family!
    <br>Open your lips, command satan!
