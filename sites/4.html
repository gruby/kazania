  <p>    
    <br>My name is Hunadi Busakwe. I'm 27 years old. I am from South Africa.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is
    <br>that I'm addicted to eating sandstones, chalk and paper.
    <br>This problem started with my mother who would eat sandstones.
    <br>I would cry for her to give me a little bit.
    <br>She would give me a little to eat to keep me quiet.
    <br>When my mother went to work, when I came back from school,
    <br>I woud go to where she hid it and take a little to eat.
    <br>That was an every day occurence. From there on, I became addicted to it.
    <br>Then suddenly, my mother stopped eating the sandstones so I was frustrated
    <br>because there was a voice telling me that I needed to eat them.
    <br>So, there was a pavement in my yard made of stones.
    <br>I would find a hard stone to break up the stones and eat them to satisfy my craving.
    <br>After that, I would graduate from that.
    <br>When at school, teachers would be using chalk to write.
    <br>If they left a small piece there, a voice woud tell me to take the chalk and eat it.
    <br>I started from there - taking chalk from teachers' offices and eating it.
    <br>When I'm at home, there is a small mountain where I've seen people going
    <br>to dig up stones to eat.
    <br>So, I would also join them to dig up stones and eat.
    <br>Every day, I would go to that mountain to dig up stones.
    <br>After that, when I didn't have access - I was in boarding in a high school -
    <br>so, there was no access for me to go and get the sandstones -
    <br>I would then eat chalk.
    <br>After that, I graduated from chalk to eating magazines.
    <br>I would start by taking the magazine and smelling it.
    <br>With the smell of the ink, the way it smelt would please me.
    <br>I would start by tearing it and then I would eat it.
    <br>ADDICTED To Eating STONES, CHALK AND PAPER!!!
    <br>This is the chalk that I used to eat, that I used to get from the office.
    <br>ADDICTED To Eating STONES, CHALK AND PAPER!!!
    <br>I eat paper, magazines and sandstones but most of all,
    <br>what I eat is sandstones that I buy from the market.
    <br>This is how I would eat it.
    <br>I would just take a bite and then eat it like this.
    <br>ADDICTED To Eating STONES, CHALK AND PAPER!!!
    <br>See her chewing it.
    <br>What of the paper?
    <br>That is how she eats it. My God!
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>ADDICTED To Eating STONES, CHALK AND PAPER!!!
    <br>Anybody who sees how fat she is, you'll think that it is vitamin B, vitamin C.
    <br>They don't know, it is paper.
    <br>How many years have you now been eating this thing?
    <br>For 19 years now.
    <br>As food?
    <br>As food; I prefer it to normal food.
    <br>I do eat food but after eating food, there would be a voice telling me,
    <br>"After eating this, you should go and eat the paper, chalk or sandstone".
    <br>I would eat it and drink water; then I would be full.
    <br>But if I don't eat those things, I would not be full.
    <br>She is eating it as normal food.
    <br>Look at her.
    <br>I've been to many places for deliverance from the spirit.
    <br>That medical doctor - I saw one Anointing Water with you, you brought it from your country.
    <br>The same Anointing Water - I will not touch - you just go to this woman and spray it and call the name Jesus.
    <br>I want to tell you today that this case is more serious
    <br>than whatever case you are talking about.
    <br>The degree of this demon is more than whatever you are complaining about.
    <br>If this problem is solved by mere spraying of the Anointing Water from the medical doctor,
    <br>the same Anointing Water he has - he should just go and face that woman and call the name Jesus.
    <br>I am giving everyone of us instruction that whatever you loose from today,
    <br>whatever you bind as from today, shall be bound, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, this is his own Anointing Water from South Africa.
    <br>He should shout the name, Jesus.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Clap for Jesus!
    <br>She has been to many places.
    <br>There is nowhere she has medically... She has fasted - no way.
    <br>For the past 19 years.
    <br>Remember the Anointing Water that man had - from South Africa he brought it.
    <br>The same Anointing Water will now wake the woman up.
    <br>Spray it on her and say in the name of Jesus, she should stand up.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, stand up!
    <br>And say, she's free.
    <br>You are free indeed!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>This woman is from where?
    <br>I'm from South Africa, Limpopo Province.
    <br>What happened to you? You were on the floor.
    <br>Have you ever seen yourself on the floor before?
    <br>Not before, not ever.
    <br>She said, not before, not ever she found herself on the floor.
    <br>When they sprayed the Anointing Water, what happened
    <br>that you found yourself on the floor?
    <br>I don't know what came over me. I just became loose.
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>Now, bring the instrument of satan.
    <br>Bring it out and let's see - everything you used to eat.

    <br>I don't feel like eating them anymore; they don't taste good.
    <br>It's actually sour.
    <br>But before, how did it taste?
    <br>Very nice, it would melt in my mouth; it would be like chocolate.

    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Let's hear from you.
    <br>My name is Husade Busakwe. I come from South Africa. I'm 27 years of age.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>was the problem of being addicted to eating sandstones, chalk and paper.
    <br>This problem started when my mother would eat it
    <br>and she would give me a little bit to eat.
    <br>Suddenly, she stopped eating them but I remained addicted.
    <br>I had to satisfy that addiction, so I started eating stones
    <br>that I would get from the mountains.
    <br>If I was at school, I would eat chalk because there were no sandstones nearby.
    <br>If I was somewhere where there weren't sandstones or chalk, I would eat magazine paper.
    <br>My mother-in-law introduced me to Emmanuel TV,
    <br>where I saw people being delivered from these kinds of addictions -
    <br>eating rice, ice and sandstones.
    <br>That's when I decided to come to Lagos to The SCOAN.
    <br>I believed by coming here, I wouldn't go back to my country with this problem.
    <br>I had this problem for nineteen years
    <br>and within those nineteen years, it was so difficult for me to leave it.
    <br>I even developed anaemia because of this problem of eating sandstones, chalk and paper.
    <br>They would disturb my blood flow and my red blood cells.
    <br>This affected me in a way that I would be dizzy at all times
    <br>and I would be having chronic headaches.
    <br>That was when the doctors confirmed that I had anaemia
    <br>and that was because of this problem.
    <br>They gave me the option of a blood transfusion or going to see a dietician,
    <br>so I chose to go to a dietician.
    <br>The dietician gave me a list of foods that I should eat,
    <br>that would enhance my blood.
    <br>I followed the diet but at the same time, I ate the sandstones, chalk or paper.
    <br>I would finish a magazine in a day.
    <br>There would be so many papers in the house.
    <br>This affected me as my two year old child is eating sandstones.
    <br>When I came home from work, suddenly, she would just disappear.
    <br>When I looked for her, I would find her in my bag, eating the sandstones.
    <br>Last Sunday, I came to The SCOAN and the man of God directed the doctor
    <br>to spray me with the Anointing Water.
    <br>Suddenly, I felt loosed.
    <br>I then found myself on the floor.
    <br>Waking up from there, I was surprised because the last I saw myself,
    <br>I was standing here being sprayed with the Anointing Water.
    <br>I thank God that today I'm delivered and I am free from this spirit forever!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, a demon is behind it,
    <br>demon is the cause of it.
    <br>Since that Sunday, when you see paper, chalk, stone - how do you reflect towards it?
    <br>Since Sunday, I don't have the urge or craving to eat sandstones, chalk or paper.
    <br>I don't even have the symptoms of anaemia -
    <br>the dizziness, the headaches, I don't have them any longer.
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>This is Anointing Water with you.
    <br>You just get home; you've seen, it was a doctor that came from South Africa.
    <br>The problem we have is ignorance. Ignorance is a disease.
    <br>You have the weapon.
    <br>God loves you so much.
    <br>Now, you go home and deliver your children, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Thank you for giving us the medium to solve our problems.
