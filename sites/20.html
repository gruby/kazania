  <p>    
    <br>I would like to introduce this servant of God, T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Jesus is in him.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Greetings to you all with the love of our Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>I want us to give thanks to Jesus for the promise which says in Matthew 16:18:
    <br>"I will build My Church and gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
    <br>Give thanks to Jesus for that!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let us pray for the church.
    <br>Lift up your voice and begin to ask Jesus for the mind of Christ, a forgiving spirit,
    <br>total submission to His will...
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>...understanding, love and unity among brothers,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. Amen.
    <br>You may be seated. Hallelujah.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>I would like to talk about how much we need God.
    <br>Ask any Christian, he will tell you that he needs God.
    <br>Certainly, we all need God but we don't know how much we really need Him.
    <br>For you to be here today, you need God.
    <br>I need God to look at you;
    <br>you need God to look at me.
    <br>I need God to jump, and I need God to dance.
    <br>I need God to laugh, and I need God to cough.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "I need God."
    <br>But how much I need Him, I don't know.
    <br>I want to take you to the Book of Philippians 4:13:
    <br>"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>He never said 'some', but 'all'!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>According to Paul, in Him we live, we move and have our being.
    <br>If you know how much you need God, you would be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>If I know that I need God to walk, to look, to sleep, to put on makeup,
    <br>I would not have certain occasions for prayer.
    <br>If you know that you need God to eat, to walk, to look, to put on makeup,
    <br>you would not have certain occasions for prayer.
    <br>I want to take you to the Book of John 5:14:
    <br>"Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, 'See, you are made well. Sin no more.' "
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>See, you are well again!
    <br>In other words, see, you are blessed again!
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>This means, the man in question would still need Jesus after the healing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "I will still need Jesus after my blessing."
    <br>I will still need Him after my healing.
    <br>I will still need Him after my protection.
    <br>Because of our limitation in the things of the spirit,
    <br>we believe that we only need Jesus when we are in need of healing.
    <br>We believe we only need Him when we are in need of blessing.
    <br>We believe we only need Him when we are in need of prosperity.
    <br>Far be it, tell your neighbour.
    <br>I need Jesus more when I am well than when I am sick.
    <br>I need You more
    <br>More than yesterday
    <br>I need You more
    <br>More than words could say
    <br>I need You more
    <br>Than ever before
    <br>I need You Lord
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>If we say we know how much we need Jesus,
    <br>how many of us here have ever come to the house of God
    <br>and given a testimony about our unanswered prayer?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Coming to the church and saying: "Pastor, I have a testimony."
    <br>"Ok, give your testimony."
    <br>"Praise the Lord! I was given a sack letter. Thank you, Jesus, for giving me a sack letter!"
    <br>As a Christian, the situation you are facing now is a mere challenge to your God.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>And He will not allow you to be devoured.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>Don't despair; you are only being preserved for your proper position and possession in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>It may be to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>It may be to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>It may be to reform you for a better position in God.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>It may be to preserve you for redemption.
    <br>It may be to strenghten your desire for God.
    <br>Let me take you to 1 Corinthians 1:27:
    <br>"But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise
    <br>and God chose the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty."
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>God sometimes uses foolish things to reveal His purpose in our lives.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>Who knows what would have happened if your prayer for better conditions had been answered?
    <br>Who knows what would have happened to you?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>The thorn in the flesh of Paul - three times he came to God: "Lord, I have pain. Please!"
    <br>Each time the Lord said: "My grace is sufficient for you."
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Daniel 6. When you just look at verse 10 there:
    <br>"Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home.
    <br>And in his upper room with his windows open..."
    <br>Doing what? He went home to pray: "Thank You, Lord!"
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>When the decree was signed, the Bible says, he gave a prayer of thanks.
    <br>Take note of that; he did not say: "Lord, protect me; they want to kill me, they want to finish me!"
    <br>He only gave a prayer of thanks: "Lord, thank You!"
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>Daniel was happy whereas there was nothing to be happy about.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "You can be happy whereas there is nothing to be happy about."
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "I can be happy whereas there is nothing to be happy about."
    <br>I love to say
    <br>How much I love You
    <br>I come to say
    <br>How much I adore You
    <br>Lord I'm not here to complain
    <br>About my many problems
    <br>By Your Spirit and Your grace
    <br>I'm confident You'll solve them
    <br>I'm here to say I love You
    <br>I'm here to say I adore You
    <br>I'm here to say I love You
    <br>I love to love You Lord
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>A happy response comes from a happy heart.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>Daniel was happy whereas there was nothing to be happy about.
    <br>You too can be happy whereas there is nothing to be happy about, as a Christian.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>When everything around you suggests that there is no hope,
    <br>when everything around you suggests that there is no future...
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>...you can be happy as a Christian.
    <br>You don't have to worry
    <br>And don't you be afraid
    <br>Joy comes in the morning
    <br>Trobles they don't last always
    <br>Remember there's a friend named Jesus
    <br>He will wipe your tears away
    <br>And if your heart is broken
    <br>Just lift your hands and say
    <br>Oh I know that I can make it
    <br>I know that I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your hands
    <br>With Jesus I can take it
    <br>With Him I know I can stand
    <br>No matter what may come my way
    <br>My life is in Your Hands
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>When everything around you suggests that all hope is lost,
    <br>you can still find occasion to rejoice in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>When you look here - economic oppression, physical oppression, political oppression,
    <br>social oppression, religious oppression, demonic oppression;
    <br>when everything seems to suggest that all hope is lost -
    <br>as a Christian, you can find occasion in Christ Jesus to rejoice.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Back to Daniel.
    <br>When the decree was published, he only gave prayer of thanks.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>He did not come to God and ask for protection, blessing, healing - like many of us.
    <br>It is time to rebuke: "I rebuke in Jesus' name! I bind in Jesus' name!"
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We should not restrict God to certain answers.
    <br>When we pray, we should give thanks not just for what He has done
    <br>but also for what He is able to do.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>He is able
    <br>More than able
    <br>To accomplish
    <br>What concerns me today
    <br>He is able
    <br>More than able
    <br>And He can handle anything
    <br>That comes my way
    <br>He is able
    <br>More than able
    <br>To do much more
    <br>Than I could ever dream
    <br>He is able
    <br>More than able
    <br>To make me what He wants me to be
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>When we pray, we should not limit Jesus to a certain answer.
    <br>Assume Daniel asked for protection: "Lord, protect me!", he would receive protection -
    <br>what of his faith that later became national faith?
    <br>His God became the national God.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>When we pray, we should not limit God to certain answers.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>We should give thanks to Jesus not just for what He has done alone
    <br>but also for what He is able to do.
    <br>For we may not know how much we need Him.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>For He is able to do more than what you can ever dream.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>It takes faith.
    <br>Let me take to the Book of Hebrew 11:6:
    <br>"But without faith it is impossible to please Him."
    <br>What does this mean? It takes faith to realise that we need God to do everything.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Daniel knew early enough in his life how much he needed God to do everything.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>His consistency and faithfulness are a challenge to all Christians,
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>especially those busy elites of www.com generation.
    <br>The secret of Daniel's strength was his constancy in prayer.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>When the goings were good, "Jesus is the Lord!"
    <br>When the goings were tough, "Jesus is the Lord!"
    <br>Daniel knew that his enemies lost no time in plotting against him.
    <br>Daniel, too, lost no time in commiting himself, his way to God through prayer.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "My enemy loses no time in plotting against me.
    <br>I too will lose no time in commiting my way to God through prayer."
    <br>That is what I meant by constancy in prayer.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>If you know that you need God to do everything, to button my clothes, to comb my hair,
    <br>I would not have certain occasions for prayer, I would be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>Some of us are here today to know Jesus, while we have many that also are friends.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>I want to tell you that trusting in Christ Jesus, believing in Christ Jesus
    <br>is not a mere intellectual acknowledgement...
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>...but adherence to, commitment to, trust in, faith in, total dependance upon Him for everything.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>In John 7:12, it is clear that the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>brought about controversy and argument.
    <br>Some would say: "He is a good man", while others: "He deceives the people"
    <br>because they did not understand Him.
    <br>Naturally, what people do not understand, they call names.
    <br>What people understand, they destroy.
    <br>This is one of the ways of identifying a child of God - there will be division among people.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Division concerning His character, nature, I mean disposition, His origin.
    <br>Some will say He is a godly man, while others will say He deceives people.
    <br>This was the situation that brought Nicodemus to see Jesus.
    <br>Being a man of principle...
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>he decided to come.
    <br>Instead of sitting somewhere and hearing this and that, he decided to come
    <br>and I say thank you for your coming here today once again.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>I am not the Healer;
    <br>I am just a human being like you.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>If there is any difference between me and you, it is just the grace of God.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>It is not the work of righteousness which I have done, it is a free gift of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>I am just here as a servant.
    <br>Remember, our lives are in God's hand.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>I want to tell you something.
    <br>You always see miracles happen in your presence today.
    <br>Do you know what we mean by miracle?
    <br>If your prayer brings an answer, that answer is a miracle!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>If there were no miracles, there would be no reason for faith.
    <br>God cannot answer your prayer without a miracle.
    <br>I want to tell you: The Miracle Worker is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>His name is Jesus Christ!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>One thing you must know: Knowing God is not only to see His miracles,
    <br>but also to learn His ways.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Knowing God is not only to see His miracles,
    <br>but also to learn His ways."
    <br>Thank you; I want you to join me in prayer.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>As the deer panteth for the water
    <br>So my soul longeth after Thee
    <br>You alone are my heart's desire
    <br>And I long to worship You
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Thousands came to Graha Bethany Church for a service with God's anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>They came ready to trust in, believe in and depend totally on God
    <br>for their healing, salvation and deliverance.
    <br>When you acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Healer, the Deliverer and the Saviour,
    <br>He will do it again and again and again.
    <br>We have no reason to doubt His sufficiency.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the Deliverer and His power to deliver is unlimited.
    <br>The age of miracles has not yet passed; the evidence of God's miracle is our rising and walking.
    <br>You always see miracles happen in your presence today.
    <br>Do you know what we mean by miracle?
    <br>If your prayer brings an answer, that answer is a miracle!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Seeing what God says will produce and increase your faith for miracles
    <br>with the proof that the Scriptures were true then, and they still are.
    <br>There was one proof then and there is one proof now - miracles in His name!
    <br>If there were no miracles, there would be no reason for faith.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>What is importent to Jesus Christ is the ability to register one's willingness to receive of Him.
    <br>It is not just all up to God and certainly, it is not just all up to you.
    <br>But as Prophet T.B. Joshua says, God requires our faith to reveal His mighty power
    <br>to heal, to save and to deliver.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>God cannot answer your prayer without a miracle.
    <br>I want to tell you, the Miracle Worker is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>His name is Jesus Christ!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church
    <br>Surabaya, Indonesia
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is attending to the sick who came in wheelchairs.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>And as the power of God is present, that healing happens.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>The wheelchair he once depended on has now been rendered useless by the mighty power of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>We are here at the Indonesian crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua at the Bethany Church in Surabaya.
    <br>Can you please tell us your name, your age and the country you are from?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>His name is Sotemen Jacob and he is 67 years old and he comes from Surabaya.
    <br>What was the problem that brought you here today?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Because of the stroke.
    <br>You mean you had a stroke that caused you to be in wheelchair?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Yes, that's right.
    <br>We saw you've been prayed for by T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Can you explain what did you experience at that time?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>I feel happy because I'm healed and I feel healthy.
    <br>I feel so happy because I am healed and feel healthy.
    <br>And now that you have been healed - what is your promise to God?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>I give thanks to the Lord because He is so good to me.
    <br>I would like to give thanks to the Lord because He healed me already. I just give thanks to the Lord.
    <br>Amen, we pray that God will give you the grace to stay close to Him and far from sin, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Healing Continues
    <br>What's your name?
    <br>Tina.
    <br>Do you believe God and will you live for Jesus?
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Tina is clearly not with herself as she falls under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>For when the Holy Spirit acts, changes are beginning.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua helps her faith lifting her to her feet and she begins to walk,
    <br>as what was once weak in her life has now been made strong.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Here comes Tina.
    <br>God's promise has been fulfilled and here she is walking with ease
    <br>as if there had never been anything wrong.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Before Healing - After Healing
    <br>My name is Tina. I am 36 years old from Surabaya, Indonesia.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>I could not work because I was weak. I had stomach ache.
    <br>Every time I ate, I wanted to vomit.
    <br>I have been visiting doctors but there was no solution.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, I felt strenghtened.
    <br>There is no more pain in my stomach.
    <br>I don't need to eat my porridge anymore.
    <br>Before, I had to eat it every 2 hours.
    <br>My name is Agus Permana. I am 37 years old,.
    <br>Because of this disease, she could not walk.
    <br>I believe it is because of the power of the Lord Jesus
    <br>through Prophet T.B. Joshua that she is healed.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>I want to serve the Lord.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Healing Continues
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>An old lady who came with a body brace is right now experiencing a moment of regeneration and renewal.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>As the woman walks forward to testify, it is clear that what she is now after the prayer of the man of God
    <br>is the product of the conviction that healing obtained in Christ Jesus is healing indeed.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>We are here at the Indonesian crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua at Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya, Indonesia.
    <br>Madam, please tell us your name, your age and were are you from.
    <br>My name is Mrs. Ribkah.
    <br>I am 69 years old, from Surabaya, Indonesia.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>And what is the problem that brought you to the Indonesian crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>My problems were poor breathing, headaches, back problem and waist pain.
    <br>So I needed to wear the body brace and use the walking stick.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>And for how long have you been suffering from your back problem?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>My poor breathing started when I was young,
    <br>while my spinal problem just started last December.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>And how does this back problem affect your life?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>I could not move freely. The doctor suggested that I do not crouch. It was very painful if I moved my body.
    <br>The doctor explained that I needed to wear a body brace and that he could not offer any cure.
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>So the doctors have not been able to cure you of the problem you were having.
    <br>Therefore, you were forced to wear a waist brace, as well as to use a cane, is that correct?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Tell us what happened when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you tonight?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!

    <br>here at the Indonesian crusade?
    <br>Graha Bethany Church, Surabaya | TB Joshua INDONESIA CRUSADE!
    <br>Hallelujah, you can see, not only is she  walking, but she is bending, she is touching her toes,
    <br>all for the glory of God!

    <br>I was the one who used it. If my children took me out,

    <br>Glory be to God, she is delivered.

    <br>Give thanks to God, give thanks to Him.
    <br>After the battle, the prophet worships and gives thanks to God.
    <br>For every time He sees us through a battle,
    <br>it is in our best interest to say: "Thank You, Jesus Christ!"

    <br>Nevertheless, when you have Jesus in your heart, He remains in your heart.

    <br>He died on the cross for me and rose again for me.
    <br>As from now on, I am Yours; enter my soul, come into my life, enter my soul,
    <br>and make my heart ready to serve Him.

    <br>We have just finished the service here with Prophet T.B. Joshua at the Bethany Church in Surabaya.
    <br>Can you just introduce yourself, tell us your name, your age and where are you from?
    <br>I am Lily. I am 59 years old. I am a member of Bethany, Surabaya.
    <br>It's really amazing to see so many miracles happen in one day.
    <br>I have never seen so many miracles happen in one day.
    <br>This is proof that our Lord is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.
    <br>Nothing is impossible for God and for us who believe.
    <br>Nothing is too difficult for Him.
    <br>People who don't believe in miracles, I think they don't believe in God.
    <br>Our Lord Jesus Christ, when He was on earth, He also performed so many miracles.
    <br>Thank you, madam, for sharing your experience with us.
    <br>God bless you. Thank you very much.
    <br>My name is Julius. I am an usher in Bethany Church.
    <br>It was so great to be here because God has used
    <br>the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua to perform so many miracles.
    <br>It's a time for people to repent and live in holiness.
    <br>God will fulfill all our needs.
