  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua sent his evangelists to minister the Morning Water
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>to the congregation in Jesus' name.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The name of Jesus is power and fire which makes satan and his agents flee.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>As the Morning Water is ministered, every evil spirit in the lives of the people is exposed
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and they are set free in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let's see what happens as the evangelist encounters this lady.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, speak! Fire! Who are you in this body?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I told you before. I don't want to talk.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Say it again, in the name of Jesus Christ! Who are you in this body?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I have been here but I didn't talk.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When I came here, I didn't talk.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have no choice than to speak.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I told you before. I'm her spiritual husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Apart from spiritual husband, who else is in this body? Speak, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Speak out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Spirit of anger.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, as spirit of anger, what have you done to her?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I destroyed her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How did you destroy her?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She is a good woman. You know that? She is a good woman.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I want to destroy her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She likes helping people.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Look here!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>As spirit of anger, what have you done to her? Answer my question!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I made her to have children with different men.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, she is pregnant.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How many men have you made her to have children for?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Three. Now, she is pregnant.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell us - as spirit of anger, what did you do to the first, second and third marriage?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I destroyed everything because she is my wife.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I married her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I destroyed everything of hers because she is a good woman; she likes helping people.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Ah, you have a problem. Please, take this money."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Why does she help people?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Why?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I want people to suffer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, how did you destroy the second marriage?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She had married once; I destroyed it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>They followed her but I was there protecting her - nobody will marry her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>They came to marry her but she said, "No".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The three children she had - for how many men?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Speak, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Three men.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She is pregnant; this is her third baby with a stupid man.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That man has his own problem.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>As spirit of anger, what have you caused her marriage?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Speak, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I told you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That what?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I destroyed the marriage because she is my wife.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How many times do I have to tell you that she is my wife?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When I came here, I never talked.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But you - you forced me to talk today.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I have been here three times. I never talked; I always hid myself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Why do you make me to talk today? You!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Today is your day and Jesus wants you to speak.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have no choice; you have to speak.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, speak! What else have you done to her?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I told you that she is a very good woman.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She has a nice future.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She likes God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I made her to go to spiritualists.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, she knows God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She says, "God of T.B. Joshua, please help me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I have been coming there but I still have problems
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>but I will never give up with the God of T.B. Joshua. I will still go to Nigeria".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She has been coming here. She came here three times.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This woman is from where?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She is from which country? Speak out!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She is from Kenya. She got married in Japan.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ok?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ok. What have you done to her career?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It is a mistake to make me talk.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Come here! What have you done to her career?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Answer me, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Which career - tell me? Which one? Do you see anything like career here?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I messed with her life since she was young, a small baby; I grew in her.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I have been there, doing these rubbish things.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She never even went to school.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She can speak English but she never went to school - she is trying!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She tried her best every day but I was still there.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But today, you make me to talk!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was here a long time ago but I never talked.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What have you done to the father of the pregnancy?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That man is a married man.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I sent that man to make her pregnant.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is my job.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What is your gain, you demon?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She wanted to abort the baby.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The man said, "I will not send you for that abortion".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Because she is a Christian, she said, "I will have this baby; maybe it is a baby boy".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I entered her since she was born from her mother's womb.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I took her from that day.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She became my wife.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And who are you?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I'm her spiritual husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have made the greatest mistake in allowing her to come here.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, you evil spirit that kills, steals and destroys -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>today is an end of you and you have to leave her body right now, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, out of this body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I command Holy Ghost fire to consume and burn every negative spirit in your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Fire all over your body!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>From your head to the sole of your feet, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have no choice. You have to leave right now. Your time has expired.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, out of this body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I'm not going.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have no choice. You have to leave in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I will never leave her!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have to leave!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have to leave! You have no choice.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, pack all your things, you spirit of anger and all of you!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, out of this body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have no choice. You are making a mistake.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have no choice. You have to leave, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have to leave. Come here!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Come here!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have to leave, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, you have to go!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have to go! Continue to remove everything!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Everything that belongs to you - remove it right now, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Remember, you cannot deceive anyone! You have to come out!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That evil spirit, that demon that has been deposited in your body,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am a big snake.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I live here.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now, all of you will leave right now!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>All of you will leave!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You python, out of this body! Fire all over your body!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Fire all over your body!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>As a snake - can you move as a snake?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Move as a snake; let us see you!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Move as a snake, you demon!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When you move like this, what happens?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You know what happens.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She will not be happy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now all of you demons, in the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>out!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Your back on the floor, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ, for her deliverance!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ, for sending us this Morning Water
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>through your servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You are free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Rise up, sister.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You are delivered through the medium of Morning Water
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and you are delivered forever, in Jesus' name.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I will never give up on You!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I have been suffering for long. Thank You!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Sister, your past is over.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Jesus Christ has just delivered you through the medium of the Morning Water
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>sent to you by Prophet T.B. Joshua and don't cry anymore.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Today, the Lord Jesus Christ has restored your joy
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and you will continue to walk in the light of your testimony, in Jesus' name.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Amen.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My name is Bahati. I am originally from Kenya.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I live in Japan.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am so happy to be here to testify about my deliverance.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My testimony goes like this.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was born into a poverty-stricken family and did not know my father.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I grew up with my mum and she could not afford to send me to school.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When I was eight or nine years old, she passed away.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My sister took me when I was aged nine to help her in the house.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She introduced me to church; so, I started going to Sunday school.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>By the grace of God, that church announced that there were people who would support
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>poor children who could not go to school.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>By that time, I was nine years and I had never entered any school.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, I agreed, wrote my name and was lucky to get the opportunity to go to school.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In school, because of my age, they could not take me to standard 1 or 2 but straight to class 4.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The people from class 4 knew how to read and write and speak English.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It was hard for me; I didn't know what to do in that class.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So what about you? Were you able to read, write and speak English?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>No! I could not even say the alphabet.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It was so hard because those people could write very well.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was so stressed and depressed.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Then, after one year, I went to the next class which was even harder.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Then, I went to another class - it was harder and harder.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, when I went to class 7, it became like 'hell'. I could not cope any longer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The depression was too much because you can even get a good job with reaching class 7.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I got tired.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I said to myself, "What kind of life is this!"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I met two women who introduced me to drinking.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was drinking while going to school and the teacher noticed that I was drinking.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I stopped going to school because I could not catch anything.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I told my sister that I cannot continue going to school.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I started drinking.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Every day, I would drink and would come back home drunk.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My sister would beat me every day and get annoyed with me because I would be drunk.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I could not afford beer; so, I bought the cheap one that could kill people in Kenya.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>At what age did you start taking alcohol?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I was maybe 15 years old.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Each time you took alcohol, what would happen to you?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I would fight and because it was very strong, I would drink quickly before the police came
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and would blackout at anytime.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>They would carry me and tell my sister,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>"Your sister is in the garbage; she cannot walk".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, people would carry me and bring me home and wash me without me knowing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It continued like that. My sister got tired of me and I got tired of being beaten every day.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My sister told me, "You can move out and go and look for your own life. I'm tired!"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, I went to those people who I used to drink with.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I met one man and told him, "Please, I don't have anywhere to go. Can I stay with you?"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So you mean that by this time, your elder sister had driven you out of the house
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>because she was tired of you?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I started staying with the man as girlfriend and boyfriend.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I didn't know he was a gangster. I mean, an armed robber.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I knew it late but I didn't know where to go.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I stayed with him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I said, "Anything can happen; I don't care because I don't know where to go".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>One day, when we were living together, things became harder and harder
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and he could not even afford to pay the rent.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, the landlord told us, "Now, you can move out of my house
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>because you cannot pay the rent anymore".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, we moved out and asked to stay with one of his friends who was also an armed robber
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and he had two girlfriends.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After moving to his friend's house, they would go for three days and not come back.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We didn't have anything to eat for three days.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>One day, he came back with the girlfriend.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Myself and another girlfriend were in the house for three days - no food!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, they came and carried something but we didn't konw that it was money.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Afterwards, I told the one who I was always with in the house when they went out
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>that she should go and peep to see what her husband was doing with another woman.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, she went and peeped through the door and told me, "Come here! They are counting money".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I responded, "Really?" She said, "Yes". I said that I would watch.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I watched and concluded that it was true - a lot of money.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We kept quiet and pretended that we didn't see any money.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Afterwards, they left, locked the door and left the money.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, you mean that was part of the money they went and robbed?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Or stealing - I don't know. Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>They brought the money home?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ok.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I suggested to her, "Look, sister! We should break inside that house".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>But we didn't know how to do it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I told one man that I had lost my key and then he broke the lock of the door.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Then, we took the money and ran away.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Bahati
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So you mean that you and the other man's girlfriend carried all the money?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes, all the money.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We ran away to another town where nobody knew us.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We stayed there, went shopping, bought clothes, had our hair done,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>bought shoes and became new people.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If you saw us, you would not recognise that we were the ones.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I went back to my sister and the lady went back to her village.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When I went back to my sister, she could not recognise me and asked, "Are you the one?"
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I replied, "Yes, I'm your sister".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She told me, "Welcome back".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I told her how I managed to get the money.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I also gave her some money to buy me a small plot of land.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She told me to go to the city, that I should not stay there
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>because those people may look for me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The police was also looking for those armed robbers.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Those armed robbers were looking for us.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ok. You mean that police men were looking for them because of the robbery
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and they were also looking for you because of their money you took away?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, tell us - how did you get into this life of prostitution after this?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After that, I went to Nairobi; my sister introduced me to a big international club.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In that club were foreigners and tourists from many countries.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I met a Japanese man from that club.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That time, I could not even speak English.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He asked me what he could help me with.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I asked the Japanese man to take me to where they have English classes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He agreed to it and I started class.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After two months, the evil spirit came and chased the man away -
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I took a knife and chased the Japanese man away.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That was how my English class ended.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I went back to prostitution - the same club.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I met another Japanese man who told me to stay at home,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>that he would pay for everything I wanted and that he needed me to have a baby for him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I didn't know he was married.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It was after I became pregnant that I discovered he was a married man.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After getting the baby, somebody called him that he was not supposed to work in Nairobi anymore,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>that he had to go back to Japan.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He left me like that - no more contact.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I went back to prostitution and met another Japanese man.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So how many Japanese men were this now?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Three Japanese men.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The third one now?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ok. Then what happened?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That Japanese man was a divorcee but was ready to marry me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He told me that he accepted me with my first baby.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We stayed in Kenya for two years and then we went to Japan.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After five or six years, I started beating him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In his own country?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Bahati
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So what happened when you started beating him?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After a while, I thought to myself that one day, I would kill this man
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and then I will be taken to jail, that led me to divorce him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, I went through the process of divorce.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After coming back, I told him to sign but he refused.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Then, I took a knife and told him, "If you don't sign, I'm going to kill you".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, he signed the divorce paper
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and I looked for two men from Japan and slept with these men to sign for me too.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That was how I divorced my husband and the government took me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Where the government took me to, there was a limited time...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So by this time, you had a child with this man?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes, I had another child - with the husband I divorced.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So making how many children now?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Two.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>With two Japanese men?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ok. Go ahead.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When the government took me, at that place, there was a limit;
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>so, I could not go out at night and come back in the morning or over-drink
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>because it was strict.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, you mean that you were now put in a restricted area?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The government was taking care of you people - you had no chance to go out,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>drink and go to the clubhouse?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I stayed there for one year. I was stressed because I could not go out.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>One day, I got my own house and freedom.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That was when I started drinking every day, from morning to morning,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>leaving my children alone.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, you mean that by this time, your two children were living with you
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and you could not take care of them?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, when you were going out to drink and go to the clubhouse to meet men,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>who would you leave your children with?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I used to leave them alone.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>In the house?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When I would come in the morning, I would start crying, asking myself why
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and what had happened in my life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That was how I was suffering.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Bahati - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ok. So how old were these children then?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My eldest child is 13 and the other one is seven years old.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After getting my apartment, I met this Japanese lady.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She was married to an African man.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That woman said, "Ah, you have so much stress. Let me introduce you to idol worship".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I told her, "No, I cannot worship idols; I am a Christian".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She continued disturbing me for almost two years.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>One day - because she was married to a black man - I decided to face the husband
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>to stop this woman from disturbing me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, I met with the husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He became my boyfriend and now, I am pregnant by him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Bahati
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So you mean the African man you met where you are living?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes, my neighbour.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Who is married to a Japanese woman?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes, they are my neighbours.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So when you went to him because you didn't want to worship idols with the wife...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes, so I didn't know...
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So you went to the husband for him to talk to the wife
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>so that she would stop disturbing you?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And you became friends - boyfriend and girlfriend?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Yes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So the pregnancy you have now is for who?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It's for him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So did the wife know about it?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I told the wife that I was pregnant by her husband.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>And what did she say?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She asked me what I was going to do and if I would have an abortion or what.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I said, "No", that I was a Christian and would not have an abortion
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>but that I didn't need anything from her - God would provide for the baby.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She complained that the husband was down and that the money was not coming in like before.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, the two children you had with those two Japanese men - where are they now?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>They are in Japan.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Tell us how you came to know about The SCOAN.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There is a Kenyan woman who lives in Japan.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Then I started watching and saw people with similar problems to mine.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I continued watching.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Last week, I got my complete deliverance, in Jesus' name.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Bahati
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>A while ago, we watched the deliverance and heard all that the demon said.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Can you tell us - what was your experience at that point in time
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>when the Morning Water was ministered to you? What were the things you saw?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That time, the anger was much.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>If I had caught the evangelist at that time,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>maybe, I could have killed her because I was so angry but it was not me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I didn't know what made me so angry and so powerful.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So all this while, you didn't know that all the life you were living,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>it was as a result of these demons - the spiritual husband and the snake?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I didn't know until I started watching Emmanuel TV and witnessed people's testimonies.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Then, I saw similar problems to mine.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I said to myself, "Yes, I think I have the same problem as this woman".
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I trust and love God and said that I would never let Him go.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What was in that Morning Water that was ministered to you
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>that would make you lose your temper - you felt like fighting and destroying?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I don't know. It was the spirit within me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My character changed and I became violent.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Ok. Since after your deliverance, can you tell us of the changes you have noticed in your life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I feel light in my body.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My stomach used to feel heavy as if I were carrying many babies.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I could not sleep on my left side but now, I can - even for two hours.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I also used to eat a lot.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Do you still have the urge to go out to the clubhouse and meet men?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>You have been here for the whole week.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Do you still have the urge to go out and meet men?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>No, I am totally delivered.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Bahati
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life and now that you are delivered,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>what is your word of advice to people that are listening to you all over the world
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and people who are still living the kind of life you lived in the past?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What advice do you have for them?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My advice to the whole world is to never give up on God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Come close to Him.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He will deliver you the way He delivered me and your past shall be over.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Amen.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Don't struggle outside.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Hallelujah! Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Indeed, it is only by deliverance that our past can be over.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>So, remember, the former life you were living was a life out there in the world.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It is now that you are delivered - now you are Christian,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>now you are a born-again, now you are a believer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I want to encourage you to make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and embrace the wonderful Word of God as the most effective instrument for change.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Through this deliverance, your life will be restored and you will come back some day
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>to give a wonderful testimony of breakthrough and blessing in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Amen!
