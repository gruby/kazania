    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Florence Boni from Ghana.
    <br>The lady beside me is my biological sister.
    <br>We are here to testify to the world of the goodness of the Lord. Amen.
    <br>It all started on the 25th of May, 2013.
    <br>My sister woke up healthy; nothing was wrong with her.
    <br>After doing her household chores, she complained of tiredness.
    <br>So, she decided to relax on the couch.
    <br>A few minutes after relaxing, she started screaming for help.
    <br>Before I got there, she had fallen down and started foaming.
    <br>I started shouting for help.
    <br>Our neighbours rushed to our house to see what was happening there.
    <br>Before they got there, she started changing colour and became lifeless.
    <br>Her pulse was not working and she stopped breathing.
    <br>She became stiff and very cold.
    <br>They were screaming, "What is happening?". People started crying.
    <br>Others were standing there; they did not know what to do.
    <br>One man said that we should take her to the hospital.
    <br>My mother was not in the house then. She attended a wedding ceremony.
    <br>One man said we should take her to the hospital. They said, "No, looking at her condition, she is dead".
    <br>She had been dead for an hour. She did not collapse; she died.
    <br>She was not breathing; her pulse was not working.
    <br>She changed colour; she was very dark, cold and very heavy.
    <br>The man said that if we should take her to the hospital
    <br>they would definitely send her to the morgue because she was dead.
    <br>I remembered that she had Prophet T.B. Joshua's prayer which she recorded from Emmanuel TV on her phone.
    <br>When she complained that she was feeling drowsy,
    <br>our light suddenly went off, so we did not have access to the TV,
    <br>but she had recorded the prayer on her phone.
    <br>I immediately switched on the prayer and put it on her ear.
    <br>The prayer was "Sin's power over you has been broken".
    <br>That was what I placed on her ears.
    <br>After a few minutes, she got up and was asking,
    <br>"What is happening? What is going on?".
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

    <br>You mean to say, madam, at this point your sister had died for one hour?
    <br>Yes, she had died for one hour; she was foaming blood.
    <br>She was dark, very cold and very heavy as well.
    <br>Our neighbours were crying that she was dead.
    <br>We are seeing you holding a phone. Can you just show us what is on the phone
    <br>and how you placed that prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua on her? Tell us again what happened.
    <br>After an hour, I remembered that she had recorded
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua's prayer from Emmanuel TV on her phone.
    <br>Immediately after I remembered it, I switched on the phone and placed it on her ear.
    <br>We can see that that is the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua recorded on the phone of our sister.
    <br>Tell us again, sister. The moment you placed this phone on her ear,
    <br>as she was lying there limp and dead, what happened?
    <br>A few minutes after I placed the phone on her ear,
    <br>people of God, she got up and she was screaming,
    <br>"What is happening? What is going on? Why are these people here?".
    <br>They were all amazed.
    <br>Tell us more. What was the reaction of those who saw her in that terrible condition?
    <br>What was their reaction when she just got up?
    <br>They were all amazed.
    <br>Those who were outside quickly rushed inside to see what was happening,
    <br>because the people in our home were shouting.
    <br>Then they asked me what the phone was for.
    <br>"The phone you placed on her ear, what was it for?".
    <br>Then I showed them that it was Prophet T.B. Joshua's prayer
    <br>that she had recorded on her phone from Emmanuel TV.

    <br>At this point we want to hear from our sister directly to find out exactly what happened to her at that moment.
    <br>Sister, you are welcome. Tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>Thank you. My name is Evelyn Boni. I am from Ghana.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of the Lord in my life.
    <br>On the 25th of May this year, I was at home going about my normal chores.
    <br>Later I felt tired, so I went to the hall to relax.
    <br>I slept on the couch and I was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Suddenly, the lights went off.
    <br>That was when I started feeling drowsy.
    <br>From there, that was all that I saw myself.
    <br>Later, I saw my spirit leave my body. I realised that I was going out.
    <br>I went to the entrance of the hall.
    <br>Sister, just to understand this - at this point you had collapsed?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But, what you saw at that moment was your spirit leaving your body and beginning to go out of the house?
    <br>Yes, please.
    <br>When I got to the entrance of the hall, about to get to the porch,
    <br>I turned to look at my body and I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua sitting by my body.

    <br>Then Prophet T.B. Joshua beckoned on me to come back to my body.
    <br>I went back to my body. That was when I woke up,
    <br>and I was asking what was going on.
    <br>I realised that it took place in a few seconds,
    <br>but it was later my sister told me that it was more like an hour.
    <br>But that was all I saw.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for the Miracle-worker, the Resurrection-provider, Jesus Christ!
    <br>What we can understand from what our sister said
    <br>is that the moment her sister placed the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua on her ear,
    <br>which was recorded on her mobile phone,
    <br>at that moment she - in the spirit - saw herself leave her body,
    <br>but Prophet T.B. Joshua was sitting beside her and beckoned her to come back.
    <br>And the moment she came back and entered her body, she woke up.
    <br>To her it was just a few seconds, but actually she had gone for almost an hour.
    <br>We can see once again, this is the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua on the screen.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ for the fact that our sister is alive here in our midst today.
    <br>Sister, we believe you are in a position to really advise people of God.
    <br>Viewers all over the world watching this, everyone has access to Emmanuel TV
    <br>and the prayers that Prophet T.B. Joshua offers which are replayed on Emmanuel TV on a daily basis.
    <br>What do you want to advise people around the world
    <br>about how they should value the prayers that Prophet T.B. Joshua offers on Emmanuel TV?
    <br>My advice to the viewers globally is that,
    <br>everybody should stay glued to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>If you don't have a single prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua on your phone
    <br>or your iPad, quickly copy it because it is very important.
    <br>As I stand here, I even have a prayer as my ringtone.
    <br>I advise everybody all over the world to stay glued to Emmanuel TV,
    <br>and your problems will be over, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. We just want to hear a quick word of advice from our sister as well.
    <br>Sister, what do you want to advise the world with what the Lord has done in this family?
    <br>My advice to the world is: Stay under the umbrella of God,
    <br>and go to a living church and follow a living man of God.
    <br>Then stay glued to Emmanuel TV, because when you stick to Emmanuel TV,
    <br>you will never remain the same, in Jesus' name. Amen.
