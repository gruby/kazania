  <p>    
    <br>On the 19th June, 2016, during a Sunday Live Service at The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophecy
    <br>and a call to pray for the nation, the United Kingdom
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>We were all here when I said, "Pray for the United Kingdom"
    <br>and I said I’m seeing a strange thing happen -
    <br>it will happen to an innocent person.
    <br>It is not yet over.
    <br>They should pray and make sure they secure their lawmakers and their institution.
    <br>Let me put it that way.
    <br>Because this institution, they are the ministers and all other that make up the body
    <br>to support the president at the top.
    <br>Institution – they should give proper security to their institution in the United Kingdom.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
