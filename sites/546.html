  <p>    
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Don't be ruled by your situation.
    <br>A man may be sick in body and yet be a friend of Jesus.
    <br>Be determined.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be determined."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Be determined.]
    <br>Every day, stay true to your purpose.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Every day, stay true to your purpose despite snow, rain".
    <br>Every day, stay true to your purpose despite snow, rain.
    <br>You know what snow means.
    <br>You know what happens during snow - it is a situation that is affecting one.
    <br>Despite snow or rain, every day, stay true to your purpose.
    <br>In the midst of hardship, name calling, condemnation, soldier on!
    <br>Move on if you are called by the Most High.
    <br>Ask David and he will tell you, ask Daniel and he will tell you,
    <br>ask Meshack, Shedrach and Abednego and they will tell you.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Be determined as a Christian.
    <br>In the midst of hardship, condemnation, intimidation, name calling,
    <br>campaign of calumny, just name them, soldier on!
    <br>Move on if you are called by the Most High.
    <br>Ask David and he will tell you, ask Daniel and he will tell you,
    <br>ask Meshack, Shedrach and Abednego and they will tell you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Soldier on!"
    <br>Many believe that once they become a believer, Christian, pastor, bishop, they are free of situations.
    <br>As far as you are living, keep pressing, there will be challenges
    <br>unless you stop pressing on.
    <br>You know "pressing on"?
    <br>You don't want to stay in a position, you want to move up, move on.
    <br>As far as you move on, there will be challenges.
    <br>These challenges are the situations we are talking about.
    <br>It can only test you, cannot destroy you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My challenges can only test me, cannot destroy me."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[My challenges can only test me, cannot destroy me.]
    <br>My challenges can only test me, cannot destroy me.
    <br>My challenges will prepare me for extraordinary service.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>We Christians don't fail tests - we pass it.
    <br>It is a means to promotion.
    <br>No test, no promotion.
    <br>We don't dodge tests.
    <br>No, you can't dodge tests.
    <br>Those who dodge tests are postponing the evil day.
    <br>Those tests you were supposed to have passed and move on.
    <br>You had somebody to help you, you dodged it...
    <br>You were just pushing this thing forward.
    <br>And this is the right time to face the test, pass it and move on.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>What are your challenges?
    <br>They are meant to prepare you for extraordinary services.
    <br>Extraordinary means, when you have challenges, you pray the more, you fast the more.
    <br>Your relationship with God - because you know He is the only One that can help you;
    <br>you move closer and closer.
    <br>It is an opportunity to honour God before men.
    <br>Not: "I have this problem. They prayed for me - no answer."
    <br>You go to a witch doctor, "I'm tired. What is all this?"
    <br>You run to a spiritualist.
    <br>After they have done a lot of operations, that is when they run to God.
    <br>They have opened the stomach many times, they now come to God.
    <br>Or when the doctor says, "Go and prepare your will", that is when they run to God.
    <br>Your challenge is an opportunity to honour God before men.
    <br>You know how to honour God?
    <br>"Yes. My Lord can do it. He can!"
    <br>You smile - it is the time to smile.
    <br>People will now say, "Sorry. What has happened to you?"
    <br>"I have cancer. I have pain."
    <br>You are enjoying human sympathy.
    <br>We are enjoying human sympathy.
    <br>Human sympathy cannot solve our problem.
    <br>- "Sorry."
    <br>- "Yes, sir."
    <br>You leave the place - you go to another section.
    <br>- "Sorry. What happened?"
    <br>- "This leg."
    <br>Another one - "sorry" - that is human sympathy.
    <br>That exposes your mystery.
    <br>Behind every man God created, there are mysteries.
    <br>Mystery means:
    <br>"When I get to the man, I don't know what will happen.
    <br>He may disappear. Machine gun bullets cannot enter him.
    <br>Poison - no poison can enter him."
    <br>That is mystery because you don't want to open up to people.
    <br>But you - people know you, they know what you can or cannot do.
    <br>They know, "He will eat that food, he will finish it.
    <br>He will come. Let's bet - he will come."
    <br>And immediately he appears, "I told you he would come".
    <br>They might have made a bet but he did not come.
    <br>"You can't predict the man" - that is mystery.
    <br>Say, "Mystery".
    <br>Keep your mystery - it is a grace to protect you.
    <br>When they don't understand you, all their plans to set you up will fail.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>If you are born-again, there must be a mystery surrounding you.
    <br>What men know, they destroy; what they don't know, they call names.
    <br>When they know you, they destroy you;
    <br>when they don't know you, they begin to call you names.
    <br>That is mystery.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>What men know, they destroy; what they don't know, they call names.
    <br>"He is a wicked man. He is a foolish man. He is a witch man. He is this, that." -
    <br>because they don't know you.
    <br>And God will never allow them to know
    <br>because God knows that when they know you, they will put an end to your career.
    <br>That is what I mean by 'mystery'.
    <br>People know you,
    <br>that is what led you to what you are facing today.
    <br>They know you.
    <br>They know they can use a mere contract to draw you close.
    <br>They know they can use money to draw you.
    <br>They know how they can get you around them.
    <br>Your people know you very well.
    <br>You have series of cars you are using; on Thursday, you will use jeep, red car, yellow car...
    <br>If that mystery within you is so great, you can leave your vehicle and join the public car.
    <br>They will just see you enter the bus and sit down.
    <br>Man without mystery will always be controlled by possession.
    <br>When you are rich, you live among the rich people.
    <br>You will never look back again at where you are coming from.
    <br>Anyone that forgets where he is coming from is finished.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>Since the beginning of my ministry, my dear sister, where I came from, the beginning;
    <br>I'm still...
    <br>The food I'm eating;
    <br>when I was in secondary school - that food, I still enjoy eating it.
    <br>The mystery around me does not allow me to abandon those things, these people.
    <br>When my people see me eating that food, it gives them hope that they too can become this tomorrow.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>Your life should be full of hope to others.
    <br>Let them know where you are coming from -
    <br>that life, the food, simple life you had.
    <br>That you have a jeep does not mean you cannot abandon it and join a common vehicle to church.
    <br>Carry your children.
    <br>"We have to join 'common men' - this is where we are coming from.
    <br>We are coming from less privileged, we were not 'born with jeep'.
    <br>Don't wait until the jeep has a fault before you abandon it.
    <br>Leave it.
    <br>One week with jeep - another week, go opposite, wait at the garage
    <br>Let your children join others in the common vehicle and come to church.
    <br>When you come back home, you tell your children that this is the life where you came from.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>This is the mystery I'm talking about - it is full of protection.
    <br>Tell the world, your people that it is the grace of God in your life
    <br>that gave you money, position.
    <br>Not by power, not by might...
    <br>Don't forget these people.
    <br>Be determined - tell your neighbour.
    <br>Every day, stay true to your purpose despite snow or rain.
    <br>Don't allow your situation to rule you.
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>There are sicknesses and there is a sickness.
    <br>A sickness 'by test' and and a sickness 'by sin' - as a result of sin.
    <br>When it is to test you, it cannot destroy you -
    <br>in order to strengthen your desire and determination for God - if it is a test.
    <br>If that situation is a test, it is meant to prepare you for the future.
    <br>Like someone who is blessed - money becomes his director,
    <br>instead of the Source of the money.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When money becomes the director, the money is the one controlling you.
    <br>Because you have money, you change your wardrobe - fine, you can change your wardrobe,
    <br>but don't forget where you are coming from.
    <br>You have money, you leave where you were living - to the midst of rich -
    <br>there is nothing bad about that but don't forget these people.
    <br>You have money.
    <br>Before, when you were sick, you went on your knees asking God for prayer,
    <br>for deliverance and you were delivered.
    <br>But now, money has become the director, controller - it is the one controlling you,
    <br>telling you where to go, what to do.
    <br>You are sitting down, "The church is too warm, too much heat."
    <br>But in those days when you had nothing, you were seeking the face of God,
    <br>you could sit inside the oven.
    <br>When the money comes, you will begin to look at the time.
    <br>Some will take it up, so that I would know that I should put an end to what I'm saying.
    <br>They will raise it up like this.
    <br>That is money.
    <br>But in those days your wrist watch had no battery.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>Even though you have a wrist watch, it is always late.
    <br>For two days, you may not set it.
    <br>You just realize, "This wrist watch is setting me back".
    <br>I know something simple.
    <br>The downfall of a man is when a man forgets where he is coming from.
    <br>If you critically take time to notice the cause of your falling -
    <br>before now, you were blessed, you had money, you had everything around you
    <br>but suddenly you don't have anything - it is even like you are begging.
    <br>If you take your time to study the cause of this,
    <br>you will know that you have forgotten where you are coming from - that is the cause.
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>That is one thing - the cause.
    <br>No matter how far you go, remember where you are coming from.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No matter how far you go, always remember where you are coming from".
    <br>How To OVERCOME Challenges | TB Joshua
    <br>Once we allow possessions to take control of our lives, we are finished.
    <br>Possessions mean those things that make you, that give you honour,
    <br>those things that give you fame, pride, popularity.
    <br>Once that possession is becoming the dictator, director, commander, you are finished.
    <br>You may not finish immediately, but soon you will finish.
    <br>And this possession doesn't dry in a day - don't think it will dry in a day.
    <br>The whole thing will start from a dream.
    <br>They will begin to chase you in the dream; nightmare, having an affair in the dream, attack in the dream -
    <br>they have begun to tamper with your wealth.
    <br>And that wealth will begin to...
    <br>Take your time; I want to leave you here.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Viewers - thank you.
