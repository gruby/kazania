    <br>One by one the people fall under the anointing that breaks every yoke of satan in their lives.
    <br>At just one touch from Prophet TB Joshua,
    <br>the healing and deliverance hands of Jesus are at work,
    <br>dispelling every shade of darkness.
    <br>Among those who experienced a divine encounter with the Healer
    <br>was this woman suffering from difficulty in walking
    <br>due to severe knee pain and using knee braces.
    <br>OH MY GOSH!!! Incredible Healing For Aerospace Engineer!
    <br>See the action and reaction
    <br>as every chain that satan might have used to connect her to himself
    <br>is being disconnected, in Jesus' name.
    <br>A spiritual operation is taking place within her body
    <br>as the divine healing power of God flows through the faculties of Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>to set her free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Oh my gosh, my knee pain is gone! I can walk! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Oh my gosh, I can walk now. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Oh my gosh! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We are free! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord! Oh my gosh.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Oh my gosh, I can kneel.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Thank You! Oh my gosh, I can jump.
    <br>Thank You, Lord! Thank You, Jesus! Thank You! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Now, she is completely healed by the blood of Jesus and the fire of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The knee braces are removed and she begins to walk in the light of her testimony.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Cindy Nshuti. I am from Rwanda.
    <br>I am currently living in the United States in Florida.
    <br>I am an Aerospace Engineer by profession.
    <br>And the problem that brought me here to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations
    <br>was the problem of difficulty in walking
    <br>due to tremendous knee pain and feet pain - a problem that I had struggled with for six years.
    <br>The problem first occurred when I was living in the UK
    <br>doing my Bachelor Degree in Aerospace Engineering.
    <br>At that time I was living in rebellion to the Word of God,
    <br>and I had gone out to party with some of the people in my class
    <br>to celebrate someone's birthday, and we went to a nightclub.
    <br>While we were at the nightclub, some people got carried away and they picked me up.
    <br>When they did, they eventually dropped me on the floor and I ended up hitting my knee.
    <br>That caused my knee to swell up.
    <br>I gave it a rest for one day, because I was training for a triathlon at the time
    <br>and I didn't want to miss my training.
    <br>So after a day, I carried on with my training.
    <br>When I was training, my knee came out and I went to the emergency room.
    <br>After that they gave me a knee brace and crutches.
    <br>I was recommended to see a physiotherapist,
    <br>and eventually was able to get off the crutches,
    <br>but I wasn't able to get rid of the pain in my knee.
    <br>Over the years, just because I was relying more on one right knee,
    <br>it then also started to have issues.
    <br>So, combined together,  I had a lot of knee pain,
    <br>and I just had to use knee braces.
    <br>Last year, in 2017, I was working.
    <br>God had given me an amazing opportunity and a great job in Florida.
    <br>I was working in a lab and I was working on a project that was funded by NASA.
    <br>They were actually funding my education, my Masters Degree.
    <br>I was on a full scholarship from them, which was a blessing from God.
    <br>So, I had been doing that for a while.
    <br>Then in 2017, because I am an Aerospace Engineer by profession,
    <br>and a lot of the work that I was doing was on flight computers,
    <br>and so a lot of times I was sitting down and programming.
    <br>I eventually used to work a lot of hours
    <br>beyond the hours that we were required to work, on my own accord.
    <br>So, I spent a lot of time sitting down, and that caused even more issues in my knees.
    <br>Because I was not exercising them, they would swell and then my feet would swell.
    <br>Eventually after two years of doing this, my feet started to ache and I was in severe pain.
    <br>I started seeing a chiropractor on a biweekly basis, at least once a week.
    <br>I was just constantly going there and they were trying to relieve my pain.
    <br>They gave me some things to put in my shoes to try to relieve the pain,
    <br>but the pain was still there.
    <br>I was in a lot of pain and it was just a constant pain.
    <br>This stopped me from being able to do a lot of things.
    <br>Obviously, running was out of the question.
    <br>Climbing stairs was a nightmare. I actually used to pray before I climbed any stairs.
    <br>While going down stairs I would always be praying.
    <br>There were a lot of things that I was just not able to do -
    <br>kneeling, squatting, everything was an issue.
    <br>Standing for a long time was a problem. Sitting for a long time was a problem.
    <br>Even while I was sleeping, if I slept on one side too long my knee would cramp
    <br>and it would be really difficult to walk in the morning.
    <br>Even waking up in the morning and putting my legs down was agony.
    <br>There was nothing that I could do comfortably, because I was in so much pain.
    <br>My mom came to The SCOAN in September 2017 and she brought my sister with her,
    <br>who also had a problem with her left knee,
    <br>and it was also causing her other issues.
    <br>She was privileged to get a touch from the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua,
    <br>and she was set free from her issues.
    <br>My mom then brought my brother this year (2018) to The SCOAN.
    <br>He also had surgery on the same limb.
    <br>So, I knew this was something that we were all facing as a family.
    <br>This gave me motivation to come to The SCOAN
    <br>because I knew that I would receive relief from my pain,
    <br>and Jesus Christ would work miracles in my own life.
    <br>I knew I would have my own testimony and I would not leave here the same,
    <br>because everyone knows that we are in the Arena of Liberty.
    <br>That is how I came to The SCOAN last Sunday.
    <br>I was privileged to be in the Sunday service and the man of God came and he touched me.
    <br>Actually, the first thing that he did was to put his foot on my foot.
    <br>I screamed out saying, "Ow!" because I was in pain.
    <br>He then said, "Stand up" and as you can see in the video, he hit my knees.
    <br>I was shaking uncontrollably.
    <br>In my mind I was thinking, "Why are you shaking?".
    <br>I was trying to control myself to stop shaking, but I could not.
    <br>Even the things that I was holding onto, I started dropping them.
    <br>Then I fell down. He touched me again and said, "You are free!".
    <br>When he said, "You are free!" and I was walking, I responded, "Oh my gosh!".
    <br>I just couldn't wait. I tried to take off the knee braces.
    <br>As you can see, I was not even patient for anybody to help me take them off,
    <br>because I just felt like they were foreign to my body.
    <br>I didn't want them anymore.
    <br>I immediately wanted to kneel down,
    <br>because previously, kneeling down especially on concrete would be complete agony for me.
    <br>So I thought, "This is the best way to test it".
    <br>I immediately put my knees down and I was not in pain.
    <br>I started jumping, because I could not do that before.
    <br>And I started running and said, "Oh my gosh. Glory be to God! Thank You, Jesus!".
    <br>That is how it happened.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>OH MY GOSH!!! Incredible Healing For Aerospace Engineer! rw
    <br>What a remarkable testimony.
    <br>Show us those things that you can do now which you could not do before.
    <br>Right now, you can see that I can squat without difficulty.
    <br>I can even get down on my knees, without any problem.
    <br>So, I can praise God. I can pray.
    <br>Actually, I have been here at the Altar. I have been praying on my knees.
    <br>Another thing I can do is I can run
    <br>and I can jump.
    <br>I can do all these things. So, glory be to God!
    <br>I am really happy and I am so grateful to God
    <br>for the miracle that He has performed in my life.
    <br>Glory be to God! Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ, the Miracle-provider.
    <br>OH MY GOSH!!! Incredible Healing For Aerospace Engineer! rw
    <br>I have two advices for people who are in similar situations.
    <br>The first one is to pray to God
    <br>and ask God to search your heart for any sin that you have committed against Him.
    <br>Because when my issue happened, I was in a nightclub.
    <br>So, I was living in rebellion to the Word of God.
    <br>I was drinking and I was doing all these things - I was living in sin.
    <br>Then the problem propagated.
    <br>God gave me the gift of having good work.
    <br>Instead of spending more time with God and thanking Him,
    <br>I then put my work above Him and I was working 18 hours a day.
    <br>I was working ridiculous hours just because I wanted to.
    <br>So, I had put my job above God.
    <br>I would say that you should ask God to search your heart
    <br>so that He can also reveal to you if you are in the same situation -
    <br>if it is a cause of sin or something else.
    <br>And ask God to forgive you for it.
    <br>Then the second word of advice:
    <br>There is a word in my language called "kwihangana"
    <br>and that language is Kinyarwanda.
    <br>"Kwihangana" means to patiently endure quietly.
    <br>What I can say is, patiently endure and keep praying
    <br>because God's time is the best time.
    <br>Actually, the final thing I would like to say is if you are especially around my age,
    <br>a lot of times people in the Science field don't like to believe in God;
    <br>we try to have all these different kinds of facts and everything like that,
    <br>like disbelief in God.
    <br>So I would say, don't listen to any of that.
    <br>If you have a lack in faith, come here to The SCOAN
    <br>and you will see there is a living God!
    <br>OH MY GOSH!!! Incredible Healing For Aerospace Engineer! rw
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Wonderful advice.
    <br>Indeed, we are serving a living God
    <br>and we want to thank you for coming back to share your testimony,
    <br>to the glory of God.
    <br>Remember, that as God Almighty has performed this wonderful miracle in your life,
    <br>truly it will be a wonderful testimony to His glory.
    <br>Put your hands together once again for Jesus Christ.
