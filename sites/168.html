    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God be for us who can be against us?
    <br>I'm Favour Yaje. I'm from Cameroon.
    <br>I want to share this testimony.
    <br>It is a privilege for me to stand before the people of God and viewers all over the world
    <br>to share what the Lord has done for me through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Indeed, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>This is what the Lord has done for me through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was delivered from the spirit of masturbation and bed-wetting which I had for more than 20 years.
    <br>These two problems I mentioned almost took away my life.
    <br>I want to thank the Lord for the medium of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Can you explain to us how these problems started in your life?
    <br>This all started when...
    <br>I was bed-wetting since when I was growing up.
    <br>At certain age, the thing was like... I cannot explain because it was happening...
    <br>There was a certain period whereby once in every month, I would bed-wet, no matter what happened.
    <br>I would have a particular nightmare and when I would wake up, I would notice that I had bed-wet.
    <br>This problem came; I was not like other people.
    <br>I could not explain it.
    <br>It was something that I didn’t know how to explain.
    <br>There was a particular period of time it would happen;
    <br>there was a particular period of time every month that it used to occur.
    <br>I had tried everything.
    <br>When that period of time would come, I would try not to sleep.
    <br>I would keep myself awake but when I laid down, even at 5am it would happen.
    <br>This really was a disgrace to me.
    <br>There was nothing I could do about it.
    <br>Can you explain to us how this problem affected your relationship with your friends and your family members?
    <br>With my friends and family members, those who were close to me,
    <br>right now, I know that many of them will be surprised;
    <br>nobody knew that this was the problem that I was having.
    <br>Because at times, all I know that
    <br>there was a particular period of time I wouldn’t go out with my friends
    <br>and I wouldn’t sleep elsewhere because I knew that I would bet-wet.
    <br>That had kept me away from my friends; except I really trusted someone, I would tell them
    <br>that this was the problem that I was having.
    <br>They would ask what my problem was called and why I would only bed-wet during a particular period
    <br>but I could not explain.
    <br>You also mentioned that you had the problem of masturbation.
    <br>Can you explain to us how this problem started and how it affected your life?
    <br>The problem of masturbation was a very big problem because I had this problem for three years.
    <br>The problem started in 2008.
    <br>I was lying down and I heard a voice telling me to masturbate.
    <br>I tried to resist but there was no way.
    <br>I tried to keep myself but there was no way.
    <br>Until...
    <br>I then masturbated; I said, “if it is only once, I will do it”.
    <br>I thought that if I did it once, God would forgive me.
    <br>But when I did it once, that was how I became addicted.
    <br>I could not resist; I would hear that voice.
    <br>If I was standing in front of the mirror, it was as if I was seeing a different person.
    <br>The thought would keep coming to me; I could not resist.
    <br>Even if I wanted to pray, I wouldn’t be able to until I did it.
    <br>This is the problem that had really tormented me because each time I would masturbate,
    <br>when it was over I would be regretting, “Why did I do this thing?”
    <br>But there was no way I could stop doing it.
    <br>I fasted and prayed but after the prayer, it would still happen.
    <br>There was nothing I could do about it.
    <br>Can you tell us how you were finally delivered from these problems? How did it take place?
    <br>I was delivered through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>There was a day I got angry at myself; I said, “This cannot continue”.
    <br>I touched the screen (of Emmanuel TV) by faith.
    <br>Then, as I touched the screen while the man of God was praying,
    <br>my body started shivering; I couldn’t control myself.
    <br>But I don’t know what happened later.
    <br>It is later that I noticed that the month had come and gone.
    <br>I was thinking that I was going to bet-wet but that period of time came and passed.
    <br>There is something very important I want to share with you and the viewers.
    <br>When that period of time came, I had that nightmare I used to have -
    <br>I would urinate in the dream and when I woke up, I would find the bed wet.
    <br>But when I woke up, I was so surprised.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I was surprised to find that when I woke up, there was not even a drop and I didn't feel like urinating.
    <br>This is a sign that God had already done it but I still didn't believe.
    <br>It was after one year, when I noticed that I do not bed-wet anymore.
    <br>Let's put our hand together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean that after praying with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua through Emmanuel TV
    <br>by putting your hand on the screen of Emmanuel TV you realised that the problem of bed-wetting
    <br>has completely stopped?
    <br>Yes, I realised the problem stopped.
    <br>It is almost two years that the problem has stopped.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for the miracle worker - Jesus Christ!
    <br>Our sister explained to us earlier this was a problem that you grew up with.
    <br>Since she could remember from her childhood, she had been bed-wetting and for 20 years
    <br>she suffered from this problem.
    <br>But the moment she put her hand on the screen, prayed with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>through Emmanuel TV she was delivered effectually and completely from the problem of bed-wetting.
    <br>This has now been for how many years?
    <br>It had been 20 years.
    <br>For how long have you now been delivered?
    <br>I have been delivered for two years.
    <br>Hallelujah! In fact a million thanks are not enough for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Can you also explain to us how have you been delivered from the problem of masturbation?
    <br>I was delivered from the problem of masturbation through Emmanuel TV
    <br>and praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When I prayed, the problem was over but I didn’t know that it was over.
    <br>When I realised, it was more than one month later.
    <br>When I would stand in front of the mirror, it was as though I was seeing a different person.
    <br>I noticed that since then, when I stand in front of the mirror, that thought no longer comes to me.
    <br>When I would think of what I used to do in the past, it irritated me.
    <br>I had started watching pornographic movies.
    <br>Since I was delivered, I hate it.
    <br>I no longer enjoy seeing women or men naked.
    <br>This is the sign that God has done it for me.
    <br>These miracles, this deliverance took place in the same time period
    <br>because I came in contact with Emmanuel TV last year.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Indeed we can see that Jesus Christ has set you free.
    <br>He has put an end to your past and given birth to the future that you have been longing for such a long time.
    <br>Can you tell us what advice do you have for people out there?
    <br>We know that there are millions people out there watching now and they are also suffering
    <br>of a similar problem.
    <br>What advice do you have for them?
    <br>I advise people that the shame belongs to the devil, not to you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Any problem that you are going through, there are many young girls like me, going through this problem
    <br>of masturbation, that shame – that you don’t want people to know what you are doing -
    <br>the shame belongs to the devil.
    <br>I want to advise people to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>You may not have the Anointing Sticker or the Anointing Water or any of those mediums
    <br>but through watching Emmanuel TV, God is going to transform your life.
    <br>God has done it for me.
    <br>Develop the habit of watching Emmanuel TV and praying along with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The special day came where I received my miracle; you own day is coming.
    <br>Submit your problems to the Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>Indeed we can see that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has put an end to the past life of shame in our sister's
    <br>life, and He's given a bright future.
    <br>Her past is indeed over.
    <br>Sister, now that you have been delivered from this problem we want to encourage you
    <br>to continue to follow Jesus on the way, make God's Word a standard for your life, so you can maintain
    <br>this deliverance, in Jesus' name.
