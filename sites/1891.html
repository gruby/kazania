    <br>I CAN SEE!!! Instant Blindness MIRACLE!!!
    <br>People fall as Prophet TB Joshua prays in the power of the Holy Spirit setting captives free.
    <br>Indeed, all power in heaven and on earth has been invested in that name, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Bondages are broken as people receive an anointed touch.
    <br>Take note of this lady.
    <br>As she is prayed for by Prophet TB Joshua, she lays a complaint.
    <br>Let's listen to her.
    <br>I cannot see.
    <br>You cannot see?
    <br>I cannot see.

    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Look at my face.
    <br>Can you see me?
    <br>You can see. Come on. Go.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Healed Of Inability To See, In Jesus' Name!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I can see!
    <br>- This is red!
    <br>- Yes!
    <br>Healed Of Inability To See, In Jesus' Name!
    <br>This is red - a red colour
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Vinola Edith.
    <br>I am from Ghana.
    <br>What brought me to this place is that I could not see.
    <br>For two years now, I would be looking at objects and they were dark - I could not identify anything.
    <br>Unless you talked, I would not know that you were the one with me or you were the one coming towards me.
    <br>I thought, "What is this problem?"
    <br>This is my sister who started taking me to different hospitals.
    <br>We went to Kalibo Hospital and they booked me for an operation.
    <br>So my sister said, "No, sister".
    <br>"I will never allow you to lie down for these people to use their medical instruments on your eyes".
    <br>"Let's run away!".
    <br>I said, "Where to?".
    <br>She said, "To Synagogue to go and seek the face of God".
    <br>I said, "Ok".
    <br>So this is how she started helping me, guiding me and preparing everything.
    <br>Last Sunday we were here and she was able to help me to enter the Church.
    <br>Everything was dark; I could not identify anything.
    <br>When the man of God was coming, she told me that, "Man of God is around",
    <br>and I said, "I can't see".
    <br>She said, "He is the one coming. He is coming".
    <br>When he reached my side, she touched me like that and said, "He's around".
    <br>And I said, "Man of God, I cannot see".
    <br>He said, "You cannot see?"
    <br>I said, "Yes"
    <br>and he started praying, touching me
    <br>and he asked me to look into his face.
    <br>Actually, when I looked at the face of the man of God his eyeballs were bright and white.
    <br>I thought, "What is this?"
    <br>I started shouting, and then I started seeing.
    <br>I thank God and I thank the man of God!
    <br>I thank the evangelists and ushers! I thank Nigeria!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I am very happy. The problem that brought us to The SCOAN is that my sister could not see.
    <br>I was the one helping her to the hospitals, holding her and taking her into the Church.
    <br>We were meditating, praying, "Man of God, come to our aid. We are sitting here".
    <br>It reached the time that the man of God was around and I told her, "Man of God is around. He is almost near you".
    <br>So, she started calling him, "Man of God, I can't see". And now my sister can see.
    <br>I don't need to guide her anymore. She can see very clearly.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Healed Of Inability To See, In Jesus' Name!
    <br>She can now see.
    <br>Just demonstrate for us how you were guiding your sister into the Church that day because she could not see.
    <br>On Sunday I had to guide her by holding her like this.
    <br>So we came into the Church.
    <br>I said, "Don't fall. There is a step. Raise your head". I led her like this. That is how we came into the Church.
    <br>And now she can go on her own - I will not hold her anymore.
    <br>Healed Of Inability To See, In Jesus' Name!
    <br>Ok, that is how you guided her into the Church because she could not see.
    <br>Just tell us, when the man of God was coming,
    <br>because she could not see, you were the one explaining to her that, "The man of God is coming!".
    <br>Just tell us what was the experience that you witnessed when the Prophet prayed for her?
    <br>When the man of God was coming and I led her, I said, "The man of God is coming! He is coming!".
    <br>Because she could not see me I had to touch her, "He is coming!", before she started shouting, "I can't see".
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Well and truly it's an incredible mystery - the mystery of God's grace of healing.  And we thank God for your life.
    <br>Just tell us what would be your advice for viewers around the world?
    <br>My advice to viewers is that no matter how big your problem is, run to God.
    <br>Like her, I ran with my sister to God. Amen.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Whatever situation that you are facing, nothing is impossible for God.
    <br>Run to Him and He will provide the solution.
    <br>My advice is that whenever you are in a situation like my own,
    <br>you should not sit down for them to use their medical instruments on your eyes.
    <br>Run to God and you will receive your healing.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Move around and just greet the people around you.
    <br>Ok, let me start from here.
    <br>- Emmanuel!
    <br>- God with us.
    <br>Red colour.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>White colour.
    <br>Healed Of Inability To See, In Jesus' Name!
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You can see that she is seeing everyone here today, which is something that she could not do before.
    <br>She was being guided by her sister into the Church.
    <br>She could not see. She could not witness the activities that were taking place in the Church.
    <br>It was only what her sister was telling her that she understood what was taking place in the Church.
    <br>And today she is seeing for the glory of God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus and celebrate this awesome miracle.
    <br>We thank God for your life and for the healing that you have received.
    <br>And the healing that you have received is for the salvation of your soul,
    <br>so that you will continue to follow Jesus.
    <br>And we know the best is yet to come for you, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
