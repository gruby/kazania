  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to reason with yourself right now.
    <br>Reason with yourself - you will see what satan might have used.
    <br>You will see what satan is using to connect you to himself.
    <br>He wants you to be unhappy, he wants you to be sad.
    <br>He wants you to look at Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>Reason with yourself - you will see what satan is using to connect you to himself.
    <br>It can be sickness, infirmity, stagnation, nightmares, loneliness or depression.
    <br>These are the tools of satan.
    <br>Whatever satan might have been using to connect you to himself -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You want to be happy, but when this pain, affliction and whatever challenging situation comes,
    <br>it changes your joy.
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When Jesus says, "Yes", no one can say, "No".
    <br>I can hear chains falling!
    <br>Chains of setback - I can hear chains falling!
    <br>Chains of stagnation - I can hear chains falling!
    <br>Chains of failure - I can hear chains falling!
    <br>Chains!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
