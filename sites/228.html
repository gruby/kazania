  <p>    
    <br>My name is Urhie Anthony.
    <br>I am 37 years old. I live in Delta State.
    <br>I am an accountant by profession.
    <br>I am also a victim of internet relationship.
    <br>I met a guy on the internet two years ago.
    <br>We started chatting.
    <br>I took interest in this guy because, according to him, he was studying
    <br>for his masters in Information System Technology in NIT in the US.
    <br>He resides in Missouri in the US.
    <br>Then, I had already gotten two post graduate certificates from the University of Benin.
    <br>I wanted a foreign blend, so I became interested.
    <br>I saw him as someone that could encourage me and give me contact
    <br>on how to secure a foreign scholarship-based post graduate programme.
    <br>He started by being nice to me, encouraging me and
    <br>giving me guidelines on how best to go about securing a scholarship-based programme abroad.
    <br>Because of his goodness and encouragement, I saw the need for me to see him.
    <br>I asked, "Please, can you send me your picture? Let me see you. Let me know my friend."
    <br>He said, "Are you sure you are ready to meet with me by picture?"
    <br>I said, "Yes, I want to see what you look like."
    <br>He said, "OK, don't worry Mr Tony. I will send it tomorrow."
    <br>He didn't send any picture until after two weeks after my consistent pressure on him.
    <br>One morning, I opened my email box and saw an attachment from his email titled, 'My photo'.
    <br>I was happy that this guy had decided to send the picture.
    <br>When I opened the picture, what I saw was shocking to me.
    <br>I saw this picture of a demon with two horns.
    <br>He said he had met a guy on the internet and they became friends,
    <br>because he wanted a scholarship-based programme and this man was appreciating and encouraging him.
    <br>He demanded to know the man.
    <br>The man asked him, "Do you want to know me?"
    <br>He said, "Yes."
    <br>After two weeks he sent this very picture to his email.
    <br>When he opened his email, this was the very picture he found.
    <br>On seeing the picture, I was so shocked that I asked him,
    <br>"What is happening to you? Why this kind of picture?"
    <br>The only reply he gave was a laughter.
    <br>He just wrote, "Ha! Ha! That is me; you have met me today."
    <br>Since that encounter, my life has never known peace.
    <br>For the past two years, it has been one problem or the other.
    <br>Any further attempt for me to reach him proved abortive.
    <br>From that day, he disconnected all communication with me.
    <br>I could not reach him anymore.
    <br>The following day, snakes started manifesting in my house physically.
    <br>In two days, I killed seven snakes in my apartment.
    <br>The same colour, the same size.
    <br>I killed the first one in my lobby, very close to my wife's room.
    <br>I killed the second snake in my guest room.
    <br>I killed the third snake in my private toilet.
    <br>That was the first night.
    <br>We managed to sleep. My wife and I were so scared.
    <br>The following morning I raised an alarm and I called my friends because I felt there must have been a bigger snake.
    <br>On searching the whole place, I found two live snakes in my room,
    <br>totalling seven deadly snakes in one apartment.
    <br>First, it was internal heat that started all over my body.
    <br>As I am talking to you now, the heat is there for the past two years now.
    <br>If you look closely at my eyes, you can see that they are drooping.
    <br>After seeing the snake that day immediately the heat came upon you?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Right now, the heat has spread from my eyes to my whole body.
    <br>I feel so heavy, as if 20 bags of cement have been tied to my body.
    <br>I cannot do anything. I cannot wash myself. I cannot see. I cannot walk a long distance.
    <br>I am always tired.
    <br>How brilliant was the man?
    <br>Very, very brilliant sir. That was what attracted me to him - to learn from him.
    <br>Mr Anthony said that after a friend he met on the internet afflicted him with the demon,
    <br>he can no longer see, that he is always tired, unable to wash himself and experiences internal heat.
    <br>You will be delivered now.
    <br>I Met A DEMON On The INTERNET!!!
    <br>You will be free now.
    <br>You should be ready to counsel our youth, fathers and mothers.
    <br>That is your job.
    <br>I Met A DEMON On The INTERNET!!!
    <br>From now until December you will do that.
    <br>The ministry will not mind supporting you financially.
    <br>Before you can begin to apply for a job, it should be January.
    <br>Bring him here.
    <br>He should not wear the spectacles.
    <br>I Met A DEMON On The INTERNET!!!
    <br>Father, Your name is wonderful.
    <br>When you say, "Yes", who can say, "No"?
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That is Mr Anthony, a victim of the internet.
    <br>I command whatever the demon might have deposited in you body -
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to receive your perfect health, healing, deliverance,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>He said he had met a very intelligent guy on the internet and they started chatting.
    <br>They were friends for a long time, and when he demanded to know who the person was that he was talking to,
    <br>the guy asked, "Do you really want to know me?". He said, "Yes."
    <br>This picture we are seeing on the screen was sent to him.
    <br>Since seeing this picture, problems started in his life.
    <br>In two days he killed seven snakes in his room - snakes of the same size and colour.
    <br>Come to me.
    <br>Glory be to God in the highest.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Allow him to go into the midst of the congregation.
    <br>This is the man who said he felt like 20 bags of cement were tied around him; he was finding it difficult to walk.
    <br>We can see him walking freely right there - with ease, without any difficulty.
    <br>He said that since that encounter, he was having heat all over his body that affected his eyes.
    <br>He was going blind. He was having pains all over his body.
    <br>But today, the man of God has prayed for him, delivered him, and he is free.
    <br>I Met A DEMON On The INTERNET!!!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I can see clearly now.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>I can see clearly now.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I can see clearly now.
    <br>He is testifying that he can see clearly. The eye problem is gone.
    <br>I can see clearly.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Moving in the midst of the people, sharing with them what God has done for him,
    <br>that he can see clearly now, the eye problem has gone, the heaviness is gone.
    <br>He is walking with ease and he can see clearly.
    <br>You can see a multitude around him.
    <br>If you are using the internet, please, be careful.
    <br>Thank you, man of God. I can walk long distances now.
    <br>OK, it is alright.
    <br>Instant testimony from the man.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>This is the man - he is here.
    <br>Right now, you can see the man, Mr Anthony coming forward.
    <br>This is the man that was a victim of the internet.
    <br>I Met A DEMON On The INTERNET!!!
    <br>Watch your screen. You can see this is Mr Anthony who is now looking healthy and strong.
    <br>Previously, he could not see and his eyes were drooping.
    <br>He was having pain all over his body, but today we can see him (delivered).
    <br>This one is greater than whatever you are complaining about.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>[Hallelujah!]
    <br>People of God, what can I say?
    <br>The Lord is good.
    <br>[All the time]
    <br>As you can see me now, I am a new person.
    <br>The man you saw was a different Anthony.
    <br>It is amazing to know that the same person that you saw barely six months ago - dead -
    <br>is a renewed person who is full of life, like you are seeing me today.
    <br>I give God all the glory.
    <br>My names are Urhie Anthony. I am from Delta State.
    <br>I am an accountant by profession.
    <br>The man standing beside me is barrister Samuel Marere. He is an 'oga' to me.
    <br>He has been there with me through my troubles.
    <br>Those snakes that I killed, which I was talking about on the screen,
    <br>when I killed them, I took them to his house so that he could see them. He saw them physically.
    <br>After that experience, my life was never the same.
    <br>I was dead. I couldn't see. I was heavy. I couldn't eat.
    <br>I was finished. I thought all hope was lost until I was introduced to The SCOAN.
    <br>He was the one that introduced me to it, although he had never been here before.
    <br>When I came here to make my internet confession,
    <br>the man of God prayed for me and immediately after that prayer,
    <br>I felt some peace and lightness and I could see instantly.
    <br>Right from that time until now, I have not put on those glasses.
    <br>I no longer put on those glasses.
    <br>I am well. I eat well. You can see that I am very fat now.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>The people in my area, people around me, when they see me now,
    <br>they can hardly recognise or believe that it is me that they are seeing.
    <br>It is marvellous! It is amazing!
    <br>I give God the glory and thank Him for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>for being there for us when we need him most. He is the father. Baba, we are grateful.
    <br>One of the assignments God wants to give you is to write a book about these experiences.
    <br>My advice to the youth is that they should be careful what they do on the internet.
    <br>I went through it and I know what I suffered.
    <br>I wouldn't want you to pass through the same path I passed.
    <br>Be careful!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My name is Samuel Marere.
    <br>I am a lawyer and a politician.
    <br>Tony is my brother, my friend and my personal assistant.
    <br>He is very intelligent and I cannot do without him.
    <br>When his problem started, it was a problem to my family.
    <br>It was a very serious problem.
    <br>It was terrible. There was no native doctor around that he did not visit.
    <br>Normally I don't come here, but I watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Once you come to my chambers, you must watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I advised him that he must go to The SCOAN, that it was the only place left.
    <br>He called me one day and said that he was dying, that he could not move
    <br>and that his wife could not even carry him.
    <br>My wife cried; we rushed to his house.
    <br>The next day, I said, "Please, go to Lagos."
    <br>That was how he came to The SCOAN and today, it is a different story.
    <br>We thank God!
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
