    <br>T.B. Joshua Spent The Beginning
    <br>Of The New Year At The Prayer Mountain
    <br>Listen to what he has to say.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, see beyond your palace.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Spent The Beginning
    <br>Of The New Year At The Prayer Mountain
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Happy New Year!
    <br>I know you want to know anywhere I am, from time to time, as a man of the people.
    <br>I have been here for the past three days.
    <br>I am here because I know where I need to grow.
    <br>When we know where we need to grow, it is victory itself.
    <br>I want to pray with you.
    <br>Whatever hinders you to greatness -
    <br>it could be your weaknesses, it could be generational curses, I mean, inherited curses.
    <br>Whatever hinders you to greatness, begin to give way, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You inherited curses, I say, give way and leave my people!
    <br>You weaknesses, bad habits in whatever way, give way, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I remove you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You need a clean heart to enjoy your New Year - a right spirit within you to enjoy your New Year.
    <br>I say, whatever hinders you to greatness, give way, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, give way, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I like being one with nature -
    <br>where there are no disturbances, where we don't need to close our eyes to pray.
    <br>That is why I'm here; it is my habit.
    <br>That does not mean you should come to the mountain like this.
    <br>It is my habit; habit is a gift from God.
    <br>I developed this habit right from the beginning of my ministry.
    <br>When you look at my documentary, it has been like that.
    <br>When I need a quiet place, I run to the wilderness, to the mountain.
    <br>It has been my habit, right from the beginning.
    <br>It is a habit.
    <br>That does not mean you as Christians should also do the same.
    <br>You should also develop your habit; habit is a gift from God.
    <br>I am here to know the mind of God
    <br>concerning this fearful year, 2019 - very, very fearful.
    <br>I am here to know the mind of God concerning this fearful year
    <br>and also to pray for you and the world at large.
    <br>That is why I am here - heart to heart.
    <br>My viewers all over the world - heart to heart.
    <br>This is issue of heart.
    <br>Give me your heart; let us pray once again.
    <br>Whatever that does not reflect Jesus in your life, be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>And begin to receive a clean heart.
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus and begin to receive a right spirit within you.
    <br>Whatever that does not reflect Jesus, be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I remove them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Whatever that does not reflect Jesus, be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be cleansed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be cleansed and receive a right spirit right now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be cleansed and receive a clean heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I will be leaving today; I have been here for the past few days.
    <br>This is why Jesus gave me the grace to speak to you so that you would know where I am.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Good Morning, viewers!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Amen.
