    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are the reason I live
    <br>You're the One for me
    <br>Why should I fear when I have You
    <br>Surrounded by Your love
    <br>Your everlasting love
    <br>Why should I care what people say
    <br>They don't know what You mean to me
    <br>Oh, You are the reason
    <br>You are the reason I live
    <br>You're the One for me
    <br>You are the reason I live
    <br>You're the One for me
    <br>Why should I fear when I have You
    <br>Surrounded by Your love
    <br>Your everlasting love
    <br>Why should I care what people say
    <br>They don't know what You mean to me
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you. You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world — I want to give you a salute for your faith.
    <br>Thank you for your time.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, we shall go ahead as the Spirit direct.
    <br>I was with you — what a wonderful testimony
    <br>You have seen the reason to believe Jesus — He is reliable.
    <br>I say Jesus is reliable.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>He is reliable.
    <br>I say He is reliable.
    <br>If you rely on Him, He will not disappoint you.
    <br>He will not fail you; He is not a man.
    <br>He is not a man.
    <br>He is reliable.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>If you know that He is reliable, what you need to do is to confess what is in your heart.
    <br>When you read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation,
    <br>when you confess what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.
    <br>Take your pen and write.
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.
    <br>You know He is reliable. Now, it is time to believe Him.
    <br>You have seen He is reliable.
    <br>You can rely on Him.
    <br>If you know that He is reliable, it is time to confess what is in your heart.
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.
    <br>It means that when you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done -
    <br>fifty-fifty.
    <br>Fifty from your side, fifty from His side.
    <br>It is not totally Him.
    <br>I know it is a strange teaching to you.
    <br>Viewers, listen again.
    <br>It is fifty-fifty.
    <br>This is why you cannot just walk in and receive.
    <br>That’s why you cannot just after you have taken drugs or groaned, receive the blessing.
    <br>Your faith is needed.
    <br>You have a role to play.
    <br>It is fifty-fifty.
    <br>How?
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.
    <br>I can't hear you clearly.
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.
    <br>And what is the balance? Fifty.
    <br>From your own side - fifty.
    <br>His own side is there automatically.
    <br>It is available.
    <br>It is that the anointing is more than the demand.
    <br>So it is fifty-fifty.
    <br>To now confess what is in your heart is the problem.
    <br>Everything you are saying, "Jesus, Jesus" - you are just speaking with your lips.
    <br>You are not sincere.
    <br>You have not been sincere.
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.
    <br>That is fifty percent.
    <br>Now, the remaining fifty percent - Jesus automatically comes in to bring the balance.
    <br>It is not all up to Him; certainly it is not all up to you.
    <br>Your genuine willingness plus His ability to change.
    <br>Your genuine willingness, which is fifty percent,
    <br>His own ability to change, which is fifty percent. Fifty plus fifty.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your genuine willingness.
    <br>Not just willingness but genuine willingness.
    <br>It must involve your future.
    <br>That what I’m saying now, I mean it for tomorrow.
    <br>What I’m saying now, I mean it for the day after tomorrow.
    <br>What I’m saying, I mean it forever.
    <br>I will follow you Jesus.
    <br>Not just today - when there’s money in the pocket and when there’s no money in the pocket.
    <br>That is, confess what is in your heart.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: MATCH YOUR ACTION WITH YOUR WORDS
    <br>When we say; "To confess what is in our heart", it has to do with your present and your future.
    <br>Your present - now, and your future.
    <br>This means heart.
    <br>Heart mean present, future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whether, in the future, there will be money in the pocket,
    <br>whether there will be no money in the pocket,
    <br>there will be food on the table or no food on the table.
    <br>That is heart.
    <br>For God to say, "A man of my own heart".
    <br>He is not only considering the present of David,
    <br>He is not considering the past of David,
    <br>but He is considering his future.
    <br>Let someone say, "A man of my own heart".
    <br>A man of my own heart.
    <br>I can’t hear you.
    <br>A man of my own heart.
    <br>So for you to know what the word heart means.
    <br>Faith is of man’s heart.
    <br>Heart mean spirit, that is your spirit.
    <br>Not literal meaning.
    <br>In your school, it is not regarded like that.
    <br>Biblically, heart is spirit of man.
    <br>You can call it heart or you can call it spirit;
    <br>you can call it faith of man’s heart or you can call it faith of man's spirit.
    <br>Heart has to do with now and next -
    <br>what you will be doing now, what you stand for now,
    <br>is what you are going to start from tomorrow.
    <br>Heart.
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.
    <br>Let someone say that.
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.
    <br>If you stand before me and say,
    <br>"T.B. Joshua, I’m not well and I’m a man of God’s heart",
    <br>that is someone who obeys God, listens to God - I will help you.
    <br>But the way you now tell me a different thing, whereas it is not that,
    <br>"T.B. Joshua, I don’t have money!" - whereas you have money.
    <br>I may likely not be able to meet your need
    <br>because you have not met the fifty percent requirement.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: MATCH YOUR ACTION WITH YOUR WORDS
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>A man of my own heart.
    <br>That is, when you confess what is in your heart, the job is half done.
    <br>It means that if you just confess what is in your heart – "I need bread" -
    <br>and God does not give you that bread,
    <br>yet He is aware you have no bread,
    <br>He will protect you, cover you and be with you.
    <br>Fifty percent is okay.
    <br>In a neutral meaning - in a school, when you score fifty percent, you will get a pass mark.
    <br>It means that if you now confess God and seek what is exactly in your heart,
    <br>and you do not receive that healing,
    <br>He will be with you through that trial time until you will receive.
    <br>Because he is aware you are sick.
    <br>The heart is very important
    <br>because the Bible says, "Christianity lies in the heart".
    <br>Let someone say that.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>I can’t hear you.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>I can’t hear you.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>I can’t hear you.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Yes. Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>If many of us had known this for a long time, you would have worked out things better than this.
    <br>If I confess what is in my heart, the job is half done, I will score fifty percent.
    <br>If you now confess what is in your heart, "Lord, I’m sick. I have a headache!"
    <br>and you do not receive healing,
    <br>He will still be with you throughout the trial of that pain until you receive.
    <br>He is aware.
    <br>When God is aware of your situation, don’t bother.
    <br>The situation cannot kill you any longer.
    <br>The situation cannot destroy you any longer.
    <br>Your struggle will make you stronger.
    <br>It will not impair you but improve you.
    <br>The words — confess what is in your heart — mean: Match your action with your words.
    <br>Let someone say that.
    <br>Match your action with your words.
    <br>Match your action –
    <br>that is, what you are saying is what you are doing.
    <br>What you are saying is what you are doing.
    <br>It means that your words match with your action.
    <br>Match your action with your words means to confess what is in your heart.
    <br>What you are saying is what you are doing.
    <br>To summarise my message today:
    <br>Match your action with your words means to confess what is in your heart -
    <br>the job is half done.
    <br>Then, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.
    <br>What is the balance? Fifty percent.
    <br>Let me talk to the viewers.
    <br>Sometimes, they want me to talk to them.
    <br>They want me to face them.
    <br>All what I’m saying now, somebody would say, "Face us!
    <br>You are talking to your people here. Face us!"
    <br>Now I want to face you to tell you what I am talking about.
    <br>Viewers, thank you very much.
    <br>I don’t know the position you are in
    <br>and whatever situation you are facing - Jesus knows better.
    <br>I want to tell you right now - this is a revelation for you.
    <br>Some of us didn't know about this in the past.
    <br>But revelation is ahead of us.
    <br>We are here, revelation is there.
    <br>We have to look into revelation to receive.
    <br>Speak what is in your heart.
    <br>Like I have said in my message that faith is of man’s heart.
    <br>When we say, faith is of man’s heart, we mean faith is of man’s spirit.
    <br>When you say heart, you mean spirit.
    <br>Speak what is in your heart - the job is half done.
    <br>When you speak what is in your heart, Jesus comes in to bring the balance.
    <br>If you still haven't received that thing, it means Jesus is aware of your situation.
    <br>When Jesus is aware, it is like He has solved your problem.
    <br>There is no difference between Jesus being aware of your situation and solving your problem.
    <br>Solving your problem and being aware of your problem is the same.
    <br>If I have leg pain and I run to Jesus, "Help me! Help me!"
    <br>and Jesus says, "I will help you!",
    <br>He is aware of my leg pain. It is as good as helping me.
    <br>If He is aware of my leg pain and He has not helped me,
    <br>He has not healed me and I still have that leg pain but He is aware -
    <br>it is as good as helping me.
    <br>If He is aware of your situation, your situation becomes His situation:
    <br>Your pain becomes His pain.
    <br>By His stripes, He helps and delivers us.
    <br>Viewers, speak what is in your heart.
    <br>Speak what is in your heart.
    <br>When you speak what is in your heart and say, "Jesus", He comes to the scene immediately -
    <br>instantly, He comes to the scene.
    <br>This is the revelation for us today.
    <br>You just write it down
    <br>This is what we mean by "Match your action with your words".
    <br>Match your action with your words.
    <br>What you say should be what you are doing.
    <br>Thank you. God bless you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
