    <br>BELIEVING FIRST AND SEEING | T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Everything about Him, not only everything written - everything about Him is great.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Everything about Him is great.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Everything about Him is great.]
    <br>Everything about Him is great.
    <br>That is, everything about God is great.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I say, Good Morning.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>BELIEVING FIRST AND SEEING
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Believing first and seeing".
    <br>This is what is happening to you now.
    <br>BELIEVING FIRST AND SEEING
    <br>You just believe, not that actually in the natural, you have seen anything but you believe.
    <br>That is why you are dancing.
    <br>Because you believe, you will see the glory of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Because you believe first, you will see the glory of God."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Because you believe first, you will see the glory of God.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Because you believe first, you will see the glory of God.]
    <br>Because there are many people here that have so much pain, anxiety, tension,
    <br>and the kind of mood they came here with - so terrifying.
    <br>But suddenly, they started...
    <br>They are the ones giving the steps since morning.
    <br>Because you believe first, you will see the glory of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Because I believe first, I will see the glory of God."
    <br>The goodness of God is coming because you believe first.
    <br>Say, "Because I believe first, the glory, the goodness of God is mine."
    <br>Because I believe first, the goodness of God is mine.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The thing that keeps us from despairing is not what we see but what we believe.
    <br>This is why we have so many rich men today, with wealth,
    <br>but yet, they are despairing.
    <br>They are not happy, they are worried.
    <br>With what we can see with them - material wealth, property, money - yet, no joy.
    <br>The thing that keeps us from despairing is not what we see but what we believe.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's take a look at the Book of Luke 22:32.
    <br>"But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail."
    <br>I'm trying to be personal here.
    <br>"But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail.
    <br>And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."
    <br>What is good for Simon is good for me.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[What is good for Simon is good for me.]
    <br>What is for Simon is for me.
    <br>If Jesus is saying to Simon, "I have prayed for you", He is talking to you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>BELIEVING FIRST AND SEEING
    <br>As a Christian, believer, born again, friend of Jesus, favourite of the Kingdom of God,
    <br>that you are a born again, Christian or a favourite of the Kingdom,
    <br>you say the Kingdom is yours, is sure -
    <br>that does not mean that you are 'out of touch'.
    <br>Sickness will test you, hardship will test you but they cannot destroy you.
    <br>Affliction of all kinds may test you - they can only test you.
    <br>That you are a child of God, born again, candidate of Heaven, favourite, apostle -
    <br>that does not mean you are 'out of touch'.
    <br>Tribulation may test you; it cannot destroy you.
    <br>The Book of John 16:33 says, 'In this world, there will be tribulation; cheer up, I have overcome'.
    <br>Also, in the Book of Luke 22:32, it says, 'I have prayed that your faith would not fail'.
    <br>This means, there will be some factors or issues that will challenge your faith.
    <br>"I have prayed that your faith would not fail".
    <br>This means, there will be some factors or issues that will challenge your faith,
    <br>all of which mean, as a Christian, whatever you are going through serves a useful purpose:
    <br>1. To form and strengthen your character.
    <br>The best time to strengthen character is when the goings are tough.
    <br>You can only get a promotion after war.
    <br>2. To prepare you for eternal glory that lies ahead.
    <br>What you are passing through is to prepare you for eternal glory that lies ahead.
    <br>As you maintain a relationship with God through faith...
    <br>There are many people that claim to maintaina  relationship with God,
    <br>but the one I'm talking about - through faith.
    <br>It is this faith that enables us to endure
    <br>and to overcome the tests and hardship that confront our daily lives.
    <br>Let's look at the word "faith" there.
    <br>Let's go to the Book of Hebrews 11.
    <br>I think Hebrews 11 actually tinted the actual meaning, the definition.
    <br>Hebrews 11:1.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Remember - believing first and seeing.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"Now, faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see."
    <br>Faith is the evidence of things not seen.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Faith is the evidence of things not seen.
    <br>Whichever translation you choose, faith deals with things we cannot see.
    <br>I mean, faith is related to two realities - God and His Word -
    <br>whichever definition, translation, meaning  you have.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is all about two phenomena - God and His Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why I say:
    <br>As you maintain a relationship with God through faith -
    <br>there is no way you can maintain a relationship or have a relationship with God without faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases Him.
    <br>Faith is all about two phenomena - God and His Word.
    <br>The challenge we face today is the way we literally use faith in secular speech.
    <br>People speak of faith in the economy, in a medicine or in a political leader.
    <br>Many a times you hear people say they are stepping out in faith to a new venture.
    <br>What does this mean in the literal meaning?
    <br>It means, they don't know what will happen next or what the future holds.
    <br>Faith in the Bible is not used in that way.
    <br>But this is the 'faith' we invent to our spiritual life.
    <br>We invent that usage, that way - this is the life we live.
    <br>In other words, they feel the urge to try something new and take a stab at it.
    <br>But Bible faith is not used that way.
    <br>Bible faith is related solely and exclusively to two realities - God and His Word.
    <br>At the next meeting we want to talk about the use of faith
    <br>we invented to our spiritual entity.
    <br>The use of faith, the way we see faith out there is what we invented here to the church.
    <br>You say, "We are stepping out in faith to a new venture".
    <br>No - that is not faith we are talking about.
    <br>The faith we are talking about is the faith that lifts us above the realm of our own abilities
    <br>and makes God's possibilities available to us.
    <br>Faith lifts us above the realm of our own abilities and makes God's possibilities available to us.
    <br>That is the faith we talk about.
    <br>It is like we don't understand the word 'faith'.
    <br>We look at the word 'faith' in the dictionary - no.
    <br>The meaning given to it in the dictionary is not the same meaning in the Bible.
    <br>When you open your dictionary and you look at the meaning of faith,
    <br>and you apply it the same way in your spiritual life - you are gone.
    <br>Faith is a trust.
    <br>If you are with your senses, you would never stand to say you trust anyone,
    <br>with what you have gone through and seen.
    <br>Only a crazy person can stand today and say, "I trust him. I trust her"
    <br>when you are not the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>How they can trust someone who is not the same yesterday, today and forever?
    <br>How they can trust someone who has a beginning and end?
    <br>That is what disqualifies you from trust.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "What disqualifies you from trust - you have a beginning and you have an end".
    <br>At the same time, you are not the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You are not qualified for a trust.
    <br>Say, "I cannot trust you because you have a beginning and an end."
    <br>I can never trust you because you are not the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want you to take this thing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again,
    <br>"I can never trust you because you have a beginning and an end".
    <br>I can never trust you because you are not the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>OK, who is qualified for a trust?
    <br>Jesus - clap for Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say you trust someone; you get there, you learn he is dead.
    <br>"I trust him. He is there for me. He will do it" -
    <br>but on getting there you learn that he could not wake up - he is dead.
    <br>What will you do?
    <br>Can you still hold on with the trust?
    <br>So, the trust has changed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You trust him, "He will pay me the money, he has the money. I love him. I trust him." -
    <br>on getting there you learn that he is in a coma.
    <br>If someone is in a coma, can you wake him up to give you the money?
    <br>I love you so much but I can never trust you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I love you so much but I can never trust you."
    <br>If I'm going and you are at my back, "How are you, sir?"
    <br>Jesus never asked me to close my eyes when I'm praying.
    <br>If anybody thinks that I close my eyes...
    <br>Indeed, when you look at me, you will see my closed eyes - I'm not closing my eyes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So that I can say, "Jesus", when you are coming.
    <br>That is why I want my altar to be very far from you,
    <br>so that you will not see me when I have my eyes closed or opened.
    <br>You want my altar here - no, I said it should be there,
    <br>so that when I say, "Let's pray"...
    <br>When you are looking at me from afar, you will not know whether I closed my eyes or not.
    <br>But when I'm too close to you, you will know, "This man has not closed his eyes".
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because that name "Jesus" given to me can be prompt - Jesus!
    <br>Take note.
    <br>Faith is a trust.
    <br>We misuse the word faith.
    <br>You hear people say, 'I am stepping out in faith to a new venture'.
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>They don't know what is going to happen or what the future holds.
    <br>In other words, they feel the urge to try something new and take a stab at it.
    <br>The same definition and meaning we are taking to the church, to the Bible.
    <br>I mean, when we read the Bible, we don't know the difference between our faith in the economy,
    <br>our faith in medicine, our faith in political leader -
    <br>we don't know the difference, we mix up the whole thing.
    <br>I want to leave you here but we will continue next week.
    <br>We have to talk more about this faith, in secular speech,
    <br>and the faith that represents a trust.
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>Can you say, "Have faith in Kenneth. Have faith in my wife, husband"?
    <br>Can your husband make all things possible?
    <br>When he is not the same yesterday, today and forever?
    <br>When he has a beginning and an end?
    <br>We carry this idea to business.
    <br>People can dupe you; you can easily be duped
    <br>because of the misuse of the word 'faith', 'trust'.
    <br>You keep having so many enemies, opposition you created for yourself
    <br>because of the misusing of trust and faith.
    <br>Take this home.
    <br>Faith is a trust solely and exclusively used for two phenomena - God and His Word.
    <br>Faith lifts us above the realm of our own abilities and makes God's possibilities available to us.
    <br>Without faith, God's possibilities cannot be available for you.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Give thanks to God for giving you the grace to believe first.
    <br>Not seeing first and believing, but your case is believing and then seeing.
    <br>Give thanks to Him for giving you the grace.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>The Lord is good.
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Just a little while longer I want to pray
    <br>Can't get You off my mind
    <br>So I came to say thank You Lord
    <br>Just for loving me
    <br>Many times I do forget
    <br>Every need that You have met
    <br>Oh thank You Lord
    <br>I know You're showing me
    <br>You were there when I was down and out
    <br>You're holding me
    <br>Your love is so amazing
    <br>Oh it has changed me
    <br>Here I am with all I have
    <br>I raise my hands to worship You
    <br>I want to say thank You oh thank You
    <br>For everything for who You are
    <br>You covered me and touched my heart
    <br>I want to say thank You oh thank You
    <br>You are great yes
    <br>You are Mighty God
    <br>You walked upon the sea
    <br>And You raised the dead
    <br>Reign in majesty Mighty God
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great yes
    <br>You are Mighty God
    <br>You walked upon the sea
    <br>And You raised the dead
    <br>Reign in majesty Mighty God
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great yes
    <br>You are Holy One
    <br>You walked upon the sea
    <br>And You raised the dead
    <br>Reign in majesty Mighty God
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>You are great
    <br>Everything about You is great
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Everything about Him is great!
    <br>Worship Him.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Everything about Him is great!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>We are here today to confirm our faith.
    <br>"Do I really have faith?"
    <br>What is faith?
    <br>The question now...
    <br>If you believe you don't have faith at all,
    <br>any moment from now, your faith you believe you don't have will
    <br>simultaneously, spontaneously,
    <br>that is 'side by side', naturally grow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take note of that;
    <br>for something to be 'side by side' - that is spontaneously, naturally...
    <br>Because faith is...
    <br>Faith is not manufactured; it grows.
    <br>When you begin to see the steadfastness of God
    <br>and you realise that God is reliable...
    <br>You can say, "God is reliable. I can rely on Him" -
    <br>faith picks up and begins to grow naturally.
    <br>You just need to see the finger of God
    <br>not necessarily on you but on someone you can see, "Oh, this is finger of God".
    <br>Our faith for a long time has been on anything man has done.
    <br>Many people's faith is always on the experience of man.
    <br>"This is what this man has done - oh! God is great - yes."
    <br>But for that to apply to you, you must base that action on your own faith in God's Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why, if you continue to listen to testimonies of people,
    <br>without you basing this testimony on your faith in God's Word, it can't work.
    <br>God works on us differently; God reveals Himself differently to us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you base your faith on the experience of man, you will never grow.
    <br>You say, "T.B. Joshua went to the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights. I also want to go."
    <br>You will develop ulcer before you come home.
    <br>It means you will use ulcer to serve God...
    <br>Different routes...
    <br>The moment you know that you are taking a different route -
    <br>different from any other person in the world - you will get it, you will rely on God.
    <br>But because you believe that you can copy other people - similar experience, ways,
    <br>attitudes, ways how they overcame things...
    <br>This is what you are searching for in your Bible and you are looking for a book -
    <br>you will never grow, because you will never overcome.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Different routes to get to your destination".
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[Different routes to get to your destination.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Different routes to get to your destination.]
    <br>Let's look for peace - the little you have will be sufficient.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Look for peace - peace of heart - the little you have will be sufficient."
    <br>Without peace, if you have the whole world, you are in trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again,
    <br>"Look for peace - peace of heart - the little you have will be sufficient".
    <br>Without the peace of heart, if you have the whole world, you will have trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That will be the summary of my message.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning, you want to be great, rich, you are looking for money, business,
    <br>you are ready to do anything to get it...
    <br>Anything to get it cannot give you peace of heart.
    <br>The only thing that will give you peace of heart is to consider your neighbour
    <br>while looking for your own.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The only thing that will give you peace of heart is to consider your neighbour
    <br>while looking for your way out".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you don't consider your neighbour while looking for the way out of your problem,
    <br>you have not considered Jesus, your Creator.
    <br>Remember, your neighbour can be someone who does not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Once again:
    <br>The only way you can have peace of heart is to always consider your neighbour,
    <br>while searching for the way out.
    <br>Your neighbour can be someone who does not share the same faith with you,
    <br>your neighbour can be your enemy, your neighbour can be your friend.
    <br>While looking for the way out of your mess, difficulties, whatever situation you are in...
    <br>When you are looking for a way, "How will I get this business done? I'm poor.
    <br>I want to apply for the business" - consider your neighbour,
    <br>what is happening to your neighbour.
    <br>If your neighbour is entitled to the same business and you want to take it by any means,
    <br>you want to do anything to take that business,
    <br>and you know your neighbour is the best for that business
    <br>but you have a way of taking it - no peace of heart.
    <br>Write it down,
    <br>"While looking for a way out, always consider your neighbour".
    <br>Your neighbour can be your friend, enemy, those who don't share the same faith with you -
    <br>consider them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do you know the reason why you have to consider your neighbour,
    <br>those who do not share the same faith with you?
    <br>Your enemy today may be your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>It may be the one to take you to the promised land, your greatest enemy today.
    <br>Your greatest enemy, that wants you to die, your number one enemy today
    <br>may be your saviour any moment from now
    <br>and will be the one to take you to the promised land.
    <br>I take it back again.
    <br>While looking for a way out, consider your neighbour.
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>Wish your neighbour as you wish yourself.
    <br>Stop that your prayer;
    <br>you want to kill your enemy.
    <br>If you say you want to kill your enemy...
    <br>You know, you were once an enemy to someone else before and you were not killed.
    <br>It is a mistake that you were not killed.
    <br>I say it was a mistake that you were not killed.
    <br>Assuming you were killed, you would not want to kill your enemy today.
    <br>What a mistake of not killing you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You were once an enemy to someone else in the past.
    <br>But today...
    <br>And you want to kill your enemy.
    <br>That person - your enemy was supposed to kill you the way you want to kill your enemy.
    <br>You are wasting your time killing your enemy,
    <br>when the Lord said, "I will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are wasting your time
    <br>because the Lord said, "I will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy".
    <br>If you have killed them, who will be there to see your goodness?
    <br>Who will testify to your goodness?
    <br>Look at you - 99 percent of people here today were my enemies who wanted to kill me.
    <br>You were once fasting, praying, binding and loosing me at the same time.
    <br>In the past, 90 percent of people sitting here today -
    <br>anytime they saw Emmanuel TV, they said, "Please! Switch it off.
    <br>Over my dead body I will come to that church."
    <br>But your real body is here today because you were not killed.
    <br>Many are here today - if I called them out, they would come out.
    <br>Once, they were fasting for 3 days, vigil, prayer -
    <br>they would be the ones to bind me and at the same time they would loose me -
    <br>that was their prayer.
    <br>Don't waste your time; I don't waste my time because I know where I'm going.
    <br>We don't know where we are going.
    <br>If you know where you are going, you will not waste your time over your enemy;
    <br>no enemy can stop you from where you are going.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because you believe they can stop you, that is why you want to stop them - no!
    <br>Do and let me do.
    <br>The life is just...
    <br>There are many things we need to know that will guide us.
    <br>When you want to pray, ask for God's mercy and His favour and thank Him
    <br>and let Him know that here you are -
    <br>if you want someone, He should send you, and leave that prayer.
    <br>Stop wasting your time over your enemy.
    <br>For how long...?
    <br>I want to leave you - please, take this message.
