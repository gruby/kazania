    <br>You feel so cheated but God is with you.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good morning, church.
    <br>My name is Yolanda Alleyne.
    <br>I am from Florida.
    <br>I was born in Trinidad but I am from Florida.
    <br>I am a retired person.
    <br>I worked as an IT manager in information security for about 25-30 years.
    <br>During that time I had developed a habit of smoking and drinking a lot of wine.
    <br>I mean a lot of wine.
    <br>Four litres of wine a week, which is about two bottles that big.
    <br>Cigarettes I never run out of because the normal person would buy cigarettes by a pack;
    <br>I did not do that.
    <br>I chose to buy my cigarettes by the cartons,
    <br>where you would get ten packs of cigarettes,
    <br>and that's the '100-length' - the long ones.
    <br>I have been drinking the wine for over 20 years, cigarettes for 20-25 years approximately.
    <br>I never paid attention to it that much.
    <br>However, during the course of my retirement,
    <br>I had a very serious heart attack.
    <br>I was in an induced coma for 31 days.
    <br>When I came out of that, the doctors said to me I needed to stop smoking.
    <br>And I did try.
    <br>But I always was watching all the hymns and things like that from Africa,
    <br>because I am a freak for the television -
    <br>African movies, African hymns and things like that.
    <br>I became addicted to this stuff but not realising it at the time
    <br>because to me it was normal.
    <br>I would smoke a whole pack of cigarettes a day which is -
    <br>in one pack you will get 20 cigarettes - I would smoke that in a day quite easily.
    <br>As for the wine, I would drink two of those big 4 litre-bottles in one week.
    <br>That is a lot of alcohol for any normal person.
    <br>But I think my body and my system had got so addicted to this stuff -
    <br>I did not realise I was being addicted to it, unless I didn't have any.
    <br>If I didn't have it when I needed it, that was a big problem.
    <br>I would just stop what I was doing, get dressed, go and get the wine and then come back home.
    <br>Drinking wine was a way of life with me at that time.
    <br>Smoking the cigarettes was a way of life,
    <br>even though my doctor tried to stop me from it.
    <br>I was on medication for the smoking, for the wine - neither of which stopped.
    <br>I had been to quite a few doctors to see what they can do about this problem,
    <br>because it was a big problem for me,
    <br>considering the fact that my age too had a lot to do with it.
    <br>Let's just refer to the prophetic message that you received from the man of God.
    <br>He prophesied to you that you felt so cheated, but God was with you.
    <br>What do you have to say concerning that?
    <br>Actually I didn't just come here like that.
    <br>I was watching a couple of African hymns and movies I always looked at,
    <br>and one day I was watching this guy, one of the favourite African singers - Sonnie Badu,
    <br>and suddenly, Emmanuel TV popped up.
    <br>I didn't change my station or anything.
    <br>I was wondering how did it get to this Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Who is this?
    <br>So I switched it back
    <br>and I turned around to do something and then it was back on Emmanuel TV again.
    <br>So, I thought...
    <br>82-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH TB JOSHUA!!! ðŸ‘µðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
    <br>I turned my radio back and I turned around to do something
    <br>and all of a sudden, there was this Emmanuel TV back on my screen again.
    <br>I thought it was jinks, "What was this thing, Emmanuel TV? Who is this?"
    <br>I started watching it out of curiosity
    <br>because at that time he had just delivered somebody who had the same problem I had.
    <br>I said, "This doesn't happen. This guy is a joke."
    <br>So I started watching it.
    <br>I called my neighbour, I said, "Come and watch this guy here on television, what he is doing."
    <br>We started laughing.
    <br>I thought Prophet T.B. Joshua - prophet, there is no such thing, as a Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>So we watched the thing and I got really hooked.
    <br>Suddenly I found myself hooked on watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I ran around my house and I changed all the televisions in the house, which is 5 of them,
    <br>to Emmanuel TV, even the one on the porch is on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>82-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH TB JOSHUA!!! ðŸ‘µðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
    <br>From there on I thought to myself,  "This is truly a man of God",
    <br>after I have been watching him 7 years.
    <br>I said, "I can't get rid of the smoking and the drugs ain't doing it.
    <br>Who can I go to? I will try this."
    <br>And I came here.
    <br>When I came here; oh my God, what a surprise.
    <br>I was received with open arms.
    <br>You would think I was the queen of Sheba walking through here.
    <br>Seriously, I got treated like the queen of Sheba.
    <br>He fed me, my soul, my spiritual being - he fed that with prayers.
    <br>I have never in my life felt so relieved, so relaxed.
    <br>He did not ask me for a penny.
    <br>He did everything that a father would do for a child.
    <br>He really was like a father to me.
    <br>That I will never forget, as long as I live.
    <br>The funny thing about this:
    <br>I went back home after the prophecy of being cheated.
    <br>What happened to you concerning that?
    <br>I told him that I felt I was cheated in a way because
    <br>I kind of envied in a way people with 2, 3, 4 children, people who didn't have children,
    <br>and here I was - I only had 1 child and she was taken away from me.
    <br>That really sent me into slump.
    <br>But I think that encouraged me to drink more and to smoke more.
    <br>Because I had nobody, I had nothing.
    <br>I really think of people with so many, and there I was with nothing.
    <br>So that was my encouragement to drink and smoke.
    <br>It kind of relaxed me, made me forget the thing.
    <br>However, it did not affect my job, but in my heart it really messed up.
    <br>I went back home and my neighbours were gathered in my garage,
    <br>because it is kind of a meeting place.
    <br>Everybody is sitting and talking and we are laughing and things like that.
    <br>They were drinking.
    <br>And someone said to me, "Yole, you are not drinking."
    <br>I said, "Oh my goodness."
    <br>It suddenly dawned at me that I did not want the alcohol.
    <br>She handed me a glass, I said, "Put it down, I don't want it."
    <br>And smoking, which I did more than the alcohol is the thing that really
    <br>I needed to get rid of because of the heart condition that I had.
    <br>And when somebody brought my favourite cigarettes and handed it to me,
    <br>I put it down and said, "I don't need this."
    <br>He said, "But I thought you smoked."
    <br>And it suddenly dawned on me then -
    <br>I remembered, I have not smoked or drunk since I went back home.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together louder for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>Can you tell us for how long now you have stopped smoking and drinking?
    <br>Since March and it is a miracle for me,
    <br>because I couldn't do without my cigarettes or my wine for 10 minutes,
    <br>never mind 10 days.
    <br>But when I went back home, what happened was;
    <br>I had a house on the market for sale.
    <br>It was on the market for 200 days and the house didn't sell.
    <br>It was a fabulous house everybody said,
    <br>but I think it was to do with the price and the area - things like that.
    <br>Anyway, when I went back home, my neighbour didn't have a licence to sell houses,
    <br>so I told her to go and get her licence.
    <br>And I helped her to get the licence financially.
    <br>She got it. One week later she came back.
    <br>I said, "Now go, sell my house."
    <br>She said, "I can't. I don't have the experience."
    <br>I said, "Go and sell my house."
    <br>So she said, "OK".
    <br>She went and she did all what she had to do as a realtor.
    <br>And she called me up 4 days later.
    <br>She said, "I have got a client."
    <br>I said, "Client for what?" - I wasn't thinking about that.
    <br>She said, "The house. I sold your house."
    <br>In 5 days she sold my house.
    <br>Nobody sells that type of a house in 5 days.
    <br>So that's the miracle of a sale.
    <br>Yes, it is indeed a miracle.
    <br>Once again, put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>So we give glory to God; we know God has done well for you;
    <br>He has healed you, He has delivered you for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>We know that the young ones out there want to hear from an elderly person like you,
    <br>they need a word of advice from you.
    <br>What do you want to advise the world listening to your testimony?
    <br>I want to tell grown ups, but also the younger people,
    <br>because I started smoking when I was younger than 8 years old.
    <br>But for the younger people; I would tell them it is easy to get into smoking
    <br>and it is very very addictive.
    <br>I would tell them, "Please, try and stay away from it."
    <br>Parents, if you see your children smoking, try and talk to them, talk them out of smoking
    <br>because that is one of the worst habits,
    <br>because it doesn't stop at smoking.
    <br>It leads to other drugs, that a lot of parents don't realise.
    <br>They get into marijuana and coke and all this stuff.
    <br>I would advise that for them.
    <br>That is my advice.
    <br>We want to encourage you to continue to follow Christ Jesus along the way.
    <br>Continue to follow in the foot steps of God's Word, walk in the light of His will
    <br>and we know that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus.
