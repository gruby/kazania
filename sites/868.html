  <p>    
    <br>Egbuche Boyd Ikemufena, I am from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my very good friend.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>It started in 2013; I fell sick.
    <br>I thought it was malaria - I started treating malaria.
    <br>I was treating malaria and I saw myself going down critically.
    <br>The company I worked for asked me to go home and check what the problem was with my health.
    <br>I said OK and went home.
    <br>I came back and told them it was malaria and that I was treating it.
    <br>They said OK.
    <br>Until the extent that I could not move and they told me to go home and take care of myself.
    <br>I went to the hospital and I was diagnosed with chronic Hepatitis B,
    <br>alongside with inflamed appendicitis.
    <br>I didn't discover it on time; it took me a year to discover it.
    <br>It had gone far beyond every fibre of my being, it had eaten up my liver - I was dying.
    <br>I thought it was something money could do,
    <br>I thought money could buy my life back.
    <br>I started visiting hospitals - I tried so many of them.
    <br>They kept on referring me from one hospital to another;
    <br>to the extent that hospitals started rejecting me.
    <br>When I got to a hospital, they wouldn't admit me anymore.
    <br>They would look at me and say, "Young man, we cannot help you, please, go to another hospital".
    <br>We started touring around from hospital to hospital;
    <br>my dad, my brothers - everybody running around.
    <br>To the extent that I became critically down; if you saw me, you would run away.
    <br>I became like a skeleton.
    <br>I couldn't talk, eat, move - I was just lying down.
    <br>Everybody started running away from me
    <br>because it was during the time of the outbreak of Ebola.
    <br>Even my immediate elder brother said he didn't want to die and he left home and the town.
    <br>He didn't want to get infected; he ran away too.
    <br>I kept on pressing from one hospital to another.
    <br>I went to one hospital with my dad, and the doctor said,
    <br>"Young man, I want to tell you something. Where is your dad?"
    <br>I said, "This is my dad".
    <br>He said, "Father, take your son back home. No doctor can help him.
    <br>Medically, there is no way for him. He is just standing next to his grave. We can't do anything for him.
    <br>We cannot even operate on him due to the chronic Hepatitis B,
    <br>and the appendicitis is already inflamed."
    <br>They said they were afraid that I would not make it if I was operated.
    <br>I gave them my consent that they should do the operation,
    <br>that if anything happened, there would be no problem.
    <br>The doctor said that he didn't think anybody could do it,
    <br>that no doctor wanted to have anybody's blood on his hands.
    <br>He said I should go home and if I knew the God I was serving, I should run to Him and pray.
    <br>Hepatitis B, according to doctors, is an ailment even worse than HIV.
    <br>The doctor said it was better I had HIV than Hepatitis B.
    <br>I didn't have just Hepatitis B but chronic Hepatitis B.
    <br>During the time I was touring around hospitals,
    <br>in some of them doctors would see me and scream and run away,
    <br>some of them were like, "I don't think this guy can make it".
    <br>I was referred to one specialist at Enugu Teaching Hospital, where I met this lady.
    <br>I said, "Excuse me, madam".
    <br>She turned around and saw me; she screamed "Jesus" and ran away.
    <br>I felt so bad, I had to go back home and decided not to go to hospitals again.
    <br>If you saw me then, I don't think you would even want to stand close to me;
    <br>I was like a corpse, skeleton.
    <br>If you saw me even in clothes, my bones would be still visible - it was that bad.
    <br>It went on...
    <br>All hope was lost.
    <br>Families were crying.
    <br>My mum was like, "God, where are You?
    <br>You will not be alive and anything will come and take away one of my children".
    <br>It got to an extent that I myself lost hope and thought I was not going to make it.
    <br>I said to myself that it was my end.
    <br>I would wake up every morning, go behind the house to the backyard,
    <br>I would look at the space there, "Where they would bury me if I died?
    <br>Is it here or there?"
    <br>At times my brothers would be eating, playing, laughing;
    <br>I would be looking at them and saying to myself, "One day I won't see my brothers again".
    <br>I felt so much pain.
    <br>It was the worst experience in life for a man to be alive and know he was dying,
    <br>and there was nothing the doctors could do about it.
    <br>It was very very awful.
    <br>I don't know how to say this.
    <br>But to God be the glory;
    <br>I was rejected, everybody ran away - she was the only friend of all that stayed.
    <br>I told her...
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>The doctors said I should be careful and avoid physical contact with my family.
    <br>I was highly "contagious".
    <br>I started avoiding my family.
    <br>I would lock myself up in my room and instruct that nobody should come in.
    <br>But she refused; she stayed.
    <br>She would force her way in, she would come, she would clean me up.
    <br>I told her, "Are you not afraid? You will contract this thing and you might end up like me.
    <br>Go, don't come again. Forget about me. You have tried your best."
    <br>She said no and that she believed that nothing would happen to me.
    <br>She believed that even if anything would happen to me, it should come through her first.
    <br>It went on, until luckily my pastor introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw what God was using our Prophet, our daddy in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua to do;
    <br>healings, deliverance and all that.
    <br>I felt encouraged to come, but I couldn't walk, I could not embark on the journey.
    <br>I could not sit in the vehicle for that long and I didn't have money to board a flight.
    <br>I wasn't that strong - no way to come, I stayed.
    <br>I said to myself that all hope was lost, "Forget about it".
    <br>It started coming to my mind, "I'm tired of this life".
    <br>The symptoms were as if ants were running inside my body,
    <br>or as if I had Parkinson disease.
    <br>I would be checking -  I couldn't hold anything in my hands or stand; I would fall down.
    <br>All those symptoms were there and it was very very awful.
    <br>I was like, "Let me just forget everything".
    <br>I was tired, I started thinking of taking my own life.
    <br>I said, "I can't live anymore. If I have to commit suicide and go and rest, so be it".
    <br>I started thinking, trying, practising it; the way I could just end my life and go and rest.
    <br>But the more I did it, a voice would tell me, "As long there is life, there is hope; don't give up".
    <br>That voice kept on coming.
    <br>I kept seeing myself going down; I started seeing and hearing things that were not there.
    <br>I would be lying in my room and would be seeing people talking to me,
    <br>but physically those people were not there.
    <br>I would be talking back to them, but when somebody asked, "Who are you talking to?",
    <br>I wouldn't see anybody anymore.
    <br>It went to that extent that I then knew that I was beginning to cross the boundaries of this earth.
    <br>But to God be the glory,
    <br>I woke up one faithful morning, I prayed and said, "God, I have tried the doctors, I have tried the world,
    <br>I have tried with my own strength and power and they have all failed me.
    <br>Now, I want to try You, God. Give me the strength and grace to come to Your presence, and try Your grace".
    <br>I said that prayer, I slept off.
    <br>I woke up around 2 pm in the afternoon, I felt some energy and strength in me.
    <br>I stood up.
    <br>I was like, "Wow, I can move now. I think I should be going to Lagos now."
    <br>My mother was like, "Going to Lagos?"
    <br>I said, "Yes".
    <br>She said, "You can't".
    <br>I said, "No, I am leaving to Lagos, now".
    <br>They were trying to stop me but I said no.
    <br>She then came and said that she was coming with me and help me to get here.
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Immediately she started packing my bags.
    <br>After packing my bags it was almost 3 pm.
    <br>I said we were still going to Lagos.
    <br>That was how we left the house, boarded the bus and came down to Lagos.
    <br>To God be the glory, I was privileged to be among the people in the prayer line.
    <br>Our Prophet in the Lord - the man God has bestowed all of Him upon - laid just one hand...
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>This was me that was medically rejected and condemned.
    <br>I was told that I was going to die - it was painful,
    <br>but it was just a touch from God - he raised his hand and stretched it
    <br>and I saw the hand of God moving with his hand.
    <br>Immediately he touched me, I felt as if a thick cloud left me - I saw myself on the ground.
    <br>I stood up; I felt so light, like a baby, as if I was new, different,
    <br>I was confused, I was just thinking, "What happened?"
    <br>He went around, came back again and looked at me...
    <br>I wanted to say something.
    <br>He touched my stomach again.
    <br>Immediately, it was as if something like a giant moved and left me.
    <br>I fell down again and stood up.
    <br>And he said, "You are healed, in Jesus' name. Go, Jesus has healed you".
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>In me, as a human, I was still having doubt.
    <br>I was like, "Doctors condemned me; they said they could not help me.
    <br>How can just a touch take care of everything?"
    <br>I went back to the hotel where we lodged, I slept off.
    <br>I woke up late in the evening, around after 6 pm.
    <br>I then remembered that there were these retro-viral drugs they gave me,
    <br>that help to control the symptoms like this shaking.
    <br>If I don't take it, you will find me shaking and dancing, you would run away, you would think I wanted to die.
    <br>I remembered that I had not taken those pills and she was like,
    <br>"Take those pills now, before the symptoms start".
    <br>She was always afraid whenever those symptoms came up.
    <br>She rushed and she brought those pills and a glass of water.
    <br>I said to her, "I won't take these pills again".
    <br>As these symptoms didn't come up since coming back from church,
    <br>that meant that I was healed; I won't take these pills again.
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>When I left the prayer line, I was blessed with this Morning Water.
    <br>I went home.
    <br>I administered it with my family.
    <br>Because I knew I became strong, I had this strength in me,
    <br>I could now stand and call my family together, make prayers with them,
    <br>and minister the Anointing Water upon each and every one of them,
    <br>and then minister it upon myself.
    <br>Immediately I ministered it into my mouth, it went down as if it was a "cold block" I swallowed.
    <br>It went down and all my body became cold.
    <br>It was like something was reviving in me, like there was something going on inside me.
    <br>After which I smiled and said, "God is at work".
    <br>A week later I went back to those doctors.
    <br>I said, "Doctor, I want to do this test again".
    <br>He said, "What else?"
    <br>I said, "The Hepatitis B test".
    <br>He was like, "You should be talking about your treatment, you are talking about test.
    <br>Take your pills and go." I said, "I want to do this test again".
    <br>They did the tests and it showed non-reactive, which is negative.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together; that clap is not loud enough for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together louder for the miracle-working God.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We know only Jesus could have justly done that.
    <br>Did you hear what our brother said?
    <br>He said he was a "living dead".
    <br>He was just living but he was already gone because doctors had already condemned him as dead.
    <br>There was nothing they could do about that sickness,
    <br>because in the world, we know it is non-curable.
    <br>But just a touch of God's finger, through His anointed servant eradicated the Hepatitis B.
    <br>Just a week later he went back to the hospital to do another test and it proved negative.
    <br>Who could have justly done that?
    <br>It is none other than who? - Jesus!
    <br>If you know that, put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Then, the doctor saw the result and he was like, "No, there is a mistake somewhere".
    <br>I said, "What mistake? There is no mistake".
    <br>He called the lab technician and asked, "What was the problem? What sort of mistake is this?
    <br>Go and rerun this test again."
    <br>They called me back to the lab room, took the samples and reran the test.
    <br>I waited in the hospital for about 30 minutes.
    <br>The result came out again.
    <br>It showed non-reactive, which is negative.
    <br>The doctor was like, "Is this magic?"
    <br>I said, "You doctors, you treat. Who heals and who cures?"
    <br>He said, "God". I said, "I visited God".
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>He then looked at me and was like, "My friend, don't be deceived by all this magic.
    <br>They are just 'magic'. You just stick to your drugs so that you have more days to live.
    <br>If not, you will just go and die. All these people are just magicians."
    <br>I just looked at him and I was like, "God bless you"; I left his office.
    <br>I went to another doctor that I met, who had run away from me,
    <br>and I said, "I am here for the same test - I want to confirm it".
    <br>They did the test again - it showed negative
    <br>The doctor looked at me and said, "What happened?"
    <br>I said, "Doctor, I went to The SCOAN and I met with God".
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Immediately, the doctor called the nurses and he showed them the result.
    <br>The nurses started jumping and dancing.
    <br>They left all the patients they were attending to.
    <br>They were all dancing in the hospital, shouting, singing praises.
    <br>I was just looking at them.
    <br>They were all hugging me, one after the other, thanking God for my life.
    <br>Everybody was so happy.
    <br>I went back home.
    <br>My mum looked at me.
    <br>In the compound where I live everybody was dancing, singing and we were all happy.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>I stayed...
    <br>I had to go back and do the test again to confirm; it showed negative.
    <br>I smiled within me.
    <br>A year after, I was still living.
    <br>Doctors said I was going to die soon, but  there I am alive.
    <br>This is two years now; I'm alive, healthy, stronger, as you can see.
    <br>Put your hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>Yes, if Jesus says yes, no one can say no.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the Master Healer, and we have seen the proof in the life of our brother,
    <br>who is a living testimony.
    <br>These are the Hepatitis B genotypes.
    <br>As you can see here, all showed positive, they were all detected.
    <br>This is the Hepatitis B DNA.
    <br>You can see here; this is the viral load and the DNA.
    <br>It shows that it is there on the high side.
    <br>This is also another confirmation from the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba.
    <br>It shows positive.
    <br>That was before I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>This was after my encounter with God, through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I went back and I did another test, and here it says, "non-reactive", which is negative.
    <br>Weeks later I still went back for another confirmation and it still showed the same report,
    <br>"non-reactive", which is negative.
    <br>I wasn't satisfied.
    <br>To clear my doubts I had to go and do retro-viral screening,
    <br>which means all viral infections test.
    <br>They all showed negative, including HIV; everything shows negative.
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>The person beside me is my very good friend.
    <br>I am very happy to stand here to testify to the goodness of God in my friend's life.
    <br>Back in 2014 he was in a very very bad condition.
    <br>The sickness was very bad within him; he could not talk, walk or eat.
    <br>I used to call him then letter "I" because he was as slim as the letter "I".
    <br>The doctors said that he wouldn't make it,
    <br>even if he spent all his money, he was not going to make it.
    <br>But today he is alive, to the glory of God.
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>We have heard from the friend, who is a witness to the condition the brother was in,
    <br>before he came to The SCOAN.
    <br>And now, that God Almighty has healed him, she is also a witness,
    <br>and she is telling us of God's goodness in his life.
    <br>Demonstrate to us the things you can do now, which you could not do before.
    <br>Before...
    <br>I know, when they say that some people are "walking corpse";
    <br>mind how you act, don't slap somebody, don't fight.
    <br>You might just slap him and he would die - he is a "walking corpse".
    <br>With my experience I knew what a "walking corpse" really was
    <br>because I could not do anything on my own.
    <br>But now, if you permit me, I can climb up the stairs and jump down from there.
    <br>I can...
    <br>I am strong now.
    <br>I can do anything.
    <br>I go to do my sports exercise, I run 10 km every morning, I do my trainings;
    <br>all those things I couldn't do before.
    <br>Before, I couldn't eat.
    <br>For about 5 months I was on vegetables and fruits; I couldn't eat.
    <br>But now, I eat anything I see comfortably - no problem anymore.
    <br>As you see me now, I will tell you I'm even stronger than everybody here.
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>My advice for the viewers all over the world, especially the youths is that:
    <br>God is the Author and Finisher of our faith.
    <br>Our Prophet always says, "When we sin, we shouldn't run away from God, rather we should run to God".
    <br>Also, the Bible made it known that sickness is from the pit of hell.
    <br>The only thing that attracts sickness is sinful nature.
    <br>My advice to viewers all over the world is to run to God, keep close to Him, do His will,
    <br>obey His commandments, and you will find yourself flying like an eagle.
    <br>My advice to them now is, "Don't listen to what people say. Come and confirm yourself.
    <br>The Lord Jesus, who is the same yesterday, today and forever,
    <br>is here, even right now, as I'm speaking - He is here.
    <br>Mr Egbuche Boyd Ikemefuna & Friend
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Hallelujah. We thank you for that wonderful advice.
    <br>As our brother has said, God Almighty never disconnects Himself
    <br>from those who make mistakes with their lives.
    <br>He loves them and welcomes them.
    <br>We know that forgiveness of sins strikes the root of all pains.
    <br>He is advising all and sundry to find out the truth, and that truth shall set us free.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for what He has done in your life,
    <br>for restoring back your health, and making you a living testimony to the goodness of God
    <br>in the lives of the people.
    <br>As God Almighty has set you free, remember that it is for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Make sure you continue to follow Him along the way,
    <br>and make His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>and we know His Word will continue to set you on the good route to the good life.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
