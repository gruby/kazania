    <br>Here we can see Mrs Olaitan Olomo
    <br>who came to The Synagogue Church of All Nations, Lagos, Nigeria,
    <br>with the problem of jaundice that affected the baby's breathing.
    <br>She knew that the baby had stopped breathing, and the doctor later confirmed this to be true.
    <br>Mrs Olaitan has been arranged for prayer due to the sickness which has affected her pregnancy.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has just begun to pray.
    <br>♪ Let my heart be...♪
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is now praying for Mrs Olaitan.
    <br>♪ Let my spirit feel the warmth of Your embrace.♪

    <br>My name is Olaitan Olomo.
    <br>I came to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations with the problem of jaundice.
    <br>My sickness was very severe.
    <br>I went to different doctors for solution, but all to no avail.
    <br>The doctor said that the jaundice affected the baby's breathing in my womb.
    <br>I told my mother, and she directed me here to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations.
    <br>When I came to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations,
    <br>I was arranged at the emergency section of the prayer line of the church.
    <br>SHOCKING: Baby Born INSTANTLY In Church!
    <br>Immediately Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, the baby was
    <br>revived and started turning to its normal position.
    <br>Instantly, the baby came out with ease. Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I thank Almighty God for using Prophet T.B. Joshua for the safe delivery of my baby.
    <br>I am alive, and my baby is alive.
    <br>My baby can breathe, eat, cry and do everything a normal baby can do!
    <br>3 years after she was delivered of her baby in The Synagogue Church of All Nations, Lagos, Nigeria,
    <br>Mrs Olomo came back to the Church with her child
    <br>to testify about the miraculous birth of the very child.

    <br>About three years ago, she came to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>with the problem of jaundice, unsafe delivery.
    <br>and she was placed at the prayer line where the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>prayed for her and she said, instantly the man of God stretched forth his hand
    <br>towards her she started feeling the kicking of the baby
    <br>and she delivered her baby instantly right there at the prayer line
    <br>and that was almost three years ago.
    <br>She is here today with a little baby named Mary.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>Mary.

    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Prayer Line
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You've heard the wonderful testimony of this woman
    <br>who came to The Synagogue Church of All of Nations prayer line.
    <br>She was here with the problem of safe delivery. She had a problem of jaundice.
    <br>And as a result of that problem of jaundice, the child was unable
    <br>to breathe in her womb. She said that it was her mother
    <br>that recommended her to come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>because before that, the doctor had actually said that she should be operated.
    <br>So she came to The Synagogue Church of All Nations
    <br>and we saw exactly what took place.
    <br>Instantly, as the man of God stretched forth his hand and prayed for her,
    <br>the baby came out instantly, followed very shortly by the placenta.
    <br>The baby that previously was not breathing came out alive
    <br>and this is the very child that we can see standing before us called Mary.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Prayer Line
    <br>Now, if you noticed in the previous interview, our sister was speaking in her local language
    <br>and right now we want to give her the freedom to express herself freely
    <br>and give her the opportunity to express herself in her local language.
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Prayer Line
    <br>My name is Olaitan Olomo.
    <br>Ten years ago, I had the problem of jaundice and was very sick.
    <br>She said that her name is Mrs Olaitan Olomo.
    <br>Ten years ago, she came to The Synagogue Church of All Nations"
    <br>for the very first time with the terrible problem of jaundice in her life.
    <br>Then, I was pregnant and at the same time I was sick with jaundice.
    <br>So, the baby in my womb was not breathing as a result of this.
    <br>She said that when she had this problem of jaundice, she was heavily pregnant
    <br>but the baby in her womb stopped breathing, stopped moving.
    <br>The baby stopped moving; so, I was afraid.
    <br>I knew something was wrong with my baby.
    <br>I suspected that the baby no longer moved, no longer breathed.
    <br>Then, I went to see my doctor who told me that my baby was no longer moving
    <br>nor breathing and that the only alternative was for me to be operated on.
    <br>So, when I went to the doctor, the doctor confirmed that truly the baby had become lifeless in my womb
    <br>and the doctor recommended an operation,
    <br>that is, the baby was to be taken out of my womb through operation
    <br>because the baby was no longer moving, no longer breathing.
    <br>I was an unbeliever then; I didn't even know who Jesus was.
    <br>So she said that as at that time, she did not know who Jesus Christ was.
    <br>She had never been to any church. She had not given her life to God.
    <br>It was my mother who was a member of The SCOAN.
    <br>But my mother was a member of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations at that time.
    <br>I told my mother that the doctor said that the only remedy for me
    <br>was to be operated on. She said that I would never be operated on.
    <br>So, when she mentioned the issue of operation to her mother
    <br>her mother said, "No! By the grace of God, you will not do any operation".
    <br>My mother asked me to come to The SCOAN
    <br>and when I came, I was placed on the prayer line.
    <br>The mother recommended that she came to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>and the moment she came, she was placed at the prayer line.
    <br>While I was sitting down at the prayer line,
    <br>the man of God came and stretched his right hand towards me and prayed for me.
    <br>Whilst I was placed at the prayer line, the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, came.
    <br>As he was praying for the people, he came right in front of me
    <br>and stretched forth his hand towards me and started praying.
    <br>Immediately, the baby in my womb turned, and I fell into labour.
    <br>Instantly, as the man of God was offering the prayer in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>the baby that had been lifeless, the baby that had stopped breathing in my womb,
    <br>that had died in my womb turned immediately.
    <br>As the baby in my womb turned,
    <br>the man of God said the baby was taking the right position
    <br>because the baby was not breathing previously.
    <br>The man of God himself confirmed at that spot
    <br>that the baby had now positioned in a proper way in the womb.
    <br>Instantly after the prayer, I went into labour and delivered my baby
    <br>right here at the prayer line where I am testifying.
    <br>Immediately the anointed man of God stretched forth his hand
    <br>and said, "In the name of Jesus Christ, you will deliver this baby right now",
    <br>she said that she lost control of herself and all she knew was that she delivered
    <br>her baby instantly right here at the prayer line section -
    <br>the very place she is standing testifying right now.
    <br>This is the baby the doctor said could not breathe.
    <br>She's alive, breathing fine, eating well, talking
    <br>and performing excellently in her academics.
    <br>She has never come second in her class; she is always first.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>The woman said that the baby that was dead in her womb, that the doctor said
    <br>would only come out through operation and that she could not deliver the baby
    <br>except through operation, right here at The Synagogue Church of All Nations
    <br>through the prayer of the anointed man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>she delivered this baby right here
    <br>and since then, the baby is living fine and she is doing fine.
    <br>Even in school, she has never come second.
    <br>Ever since she started school, she always comes first in the class.
    <br>I thank the God of T.B. Joshua for keeping me and my baby alive.
    <br>I give You all the glory and honour for Your goodness in our lives.
    <br>Thank You, God! I am very grateful!
    <br>She gives thanks and gives glory to God Almighty
    <br>that God Almighty is the reason why she is alive today.
    <br>He is the reason why her baby is alive.
    <br>She thanks God she did not have to go through the operation
    <br>that could have been a 50/50 chance or she would have lost her baby who was already dead in her womb.
    <br>But today she is alive, the baby is alive and she is here giving all the glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Let's hear what she has to say.
    <br>My name is Mary Olomo.
    <br>I want to thank God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>My mother gave birth to me at the emergency.
    <br>I would like to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for saving me and my family.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!!!
    <br>So, you mean, a while ago you watched the screen,
    <br>and you saw how you jumped out from your mother's womb?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Are you excited about that?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Right here where you are standing now?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>You can identify that that was where you standing right now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Tell us: How old are you now?
    <br>Nine years old.
    <br>Nine years.
    <br>Your mother said that ever since you were born, you've not experienced sickness, pain,
    <br>whatever, and in your class you always come first. Is that true?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And in what class are you now?
    <br>Primary five.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Wow, that is a wonderful testimony of Mary Olomo.
    <br>With what the Lord has done in your life,
    <br>what words of advice do you have for those listening to you?
    <br>My advice for those listening to me is that they should have faith in God.
    <br>They should not lose focus on God. With faith in God, He can do anything.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Our mother said that she advises everyone to believe in our Lord Jesus Christ;
    <br>that there is nothing God Almighty cannot do.
    <br>Never a sickness He cannot heal. Never a disease He cannot cure.
    <br>Never a problem He cannot solve and never a burden He cannot bear.
    <br>That any problem we think we have,
    <br>Jesus Christ is more than them and He is able to solve them.
    <br>She who never believed in Jesus Christ prior to the time she came to
    <br>The Synagogue Church of All Nations, because of the miracle of God in her life
    <br>she has now seen the mightiness of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>She has now seen and can testify that Jesus Christ is alive.
    <br>He never said goodbye, to the glory of God.
    <br>Once again, let us clap for Jesus!!!
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Prayer Line
    <br>We thank God Almighty for everything and now that God Almighty has done this in your life,
    <br>we pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace
    <br>to make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and bring up your little girl in the way of the Lord so that when she grows up,
    <br>she will not depart from it, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus!
