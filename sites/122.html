  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Every covenant with demons in your life, be broken.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you -
    <br>be it sickness or disease, are you on the sickbed?
    <br>I say, "Dry bones, rise again!"
    <br>Demon authority over you, be cancelled!
    <br>Demon authority over you, be broken!
    <br>Viewers, listen to me.
    <br>Whatever authority satan has been using to connect you, to disturb you -
    <br>you want to do this but what you want to do is not what you are doing;
    <br>what you want to think is not what you are thinking;
    <br>what you want to say is not what you are saying.
    <br>After you have said it, you say, "What made me to say this?
    <br>That is demon. He uses his medium to connect one to himself.
    <br>Whatever medium satan is using to connect you to himself -
    <br>be it medium of sickness, disease, hardship, poverty, barrenness -
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, viewers all over the world, begin to break every generational curse.
    <br>Break it, in the Name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now begin to rewrite your history.
    <br>The history of your family, rewrite it.
    <br>The history of limitation, disease, sickness, infirmity, rewrite them.
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Jesus is alive! If the Son of God sets you free, you are free indeed.
    <br>I am free because the Son of God has set me free.
    <br>I am free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Those of you on the sickbed, whatever name they call that sickness,
    <br>I want to say, "Jesus has restored you".
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus cannot heal!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Wherever you are, whatever sickness you have, whatever name they call it -
    <br>be it cancer, HIV or hypertension - whatever name, be restored!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, begin to confess your freedom
    <br>I am healed! I am delivered!
    <br>I am rescued! Defeat and failure are things of the past.
    <br>Sickness and infirmity are things of the past.
    <br>Failure and hardship are things of the past.
    <br>Setback and limitation are things of the past.
    <br>Yoke, limitation and shortcomings are things of the past, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Let the power of the Lord
    <br>From Heaven above
    <br>Let the power of the Lord come down
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, whatever situation you are in -
    <br>the right hand of God is power.
    <br>You cannot escape the power of God.
    <br>As you are watching God's power, right now, wherever you are, be delivered.
    <br>As you are watching God's power, be rescued, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>As you watch God's power, be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>As you watch Gods power, be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God as you send your testimony.
    <br>Engage with God.
