  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Jesus knows your situation.
    <br>He knows your disposition.
    <br>He knows your heart's desire.
    <br>All you need now - heart.
    <br>Wherever you are, what matters - your heart.
    <br>Begin to receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command all spirits operating in your life to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Spirit of failure, nightmare, stagnation, setback - move, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You devil, remove your hands from my people!
    <br>Your hands of failure - move, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your hands of disappointment, your hands of failure, your hands of affliction -
    <br>leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I know you are delivered!
    <br>I know you are healed!
    <br>I know you are delivered!
    <br>I know you are free!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
