  <p>    
    <br>Man of God, please, help me.
    <br>My bone got broken since six months ago, due to an accident.
    <br>I am using crutches to walk.
    <br>Please, help me, man of God.
    <br>How do you know that Jesus would heal you?
    <br>I know that God would help me because He is still keeping me alive until now.
    <br>What would happen if you are not healed?
    <br>I believe that He will heal me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you are not healed, what would happen?
    <br>He would heal me. He is my God. He is supposed to heal me.
    <br>He would heal me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have been waiting for this time. He would heal me.
    <br>But answer this simple question: If you are not healed, what would be the state of your mind?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Man of God, I would be healed. I know I would be healed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the last bus stop that I have.
    <br>I have gone to many places.
    <br>I have been talking to people in Liberia that I would come here and they would see me get healed.
    <br>You say this is the last bus stop?
    <br>This is a last bus stop.
    <br>So if this bus stop is not for you we would create another bust stop.
    <br>It is the last bus stop.
    <br>I can't go to a different place. This is the last bus stop.
    <br>I am supposed to be healed by the grace of God.
    <br>I am asking this question because it is easy to lose your miracle when you have not been grounded in the Word.
    <br>You can only maintain that miracle when you are grounded.
    <br>When you are grounded, submit to the Word after healing.
    <br>If you have been grounded and you receive the miracle,
    <br>automatically, you will be able to maintain it.
    <br>If you have not been grounded in the Word, you can receive the miracle as well
    <br>but you have to automatically submit to the Word so that you will be able to maintain it.
    <br>My father here has not been grounded in the Word.
    <br>So, if God heals him, he has to automatically submit to the  Word of God for maintenance.
    <br>Are you listening to me, sir?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>The fact that you watch Emmanuel TV every day and you sleep with Emmanuel TV,
    <br>do you actually do what Emmanuel TV is saying, what you listen to?
    <br>Are you doing what the Word says?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>What he is talking now is by feeling, emotion.
    <br>He is saying what he has been seeing happening to others.
    <br>It is not that he has received a conviction, message or revelation to come here.
    <br>For him, it's about, "I have seen people get healed, so, I am going there".
    <br>Let's hear from our mother.
    <br>How are you mum?
    <br>We are seeing you sitting here.
    <br>What revelation have you received that actually let to your coming here?
    <br>Man of God, I need help, healing.
    <br>I know you need healing.
    <br>It is revelation that brings healing.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>The product of revelation is healing, deliverance and all that.
    <br>What revelation have you received?
    <br>Have you received any revelation from God concerning your health, your coming here?
    <br>If not, after your healing, you have to submit.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Submit to the authority of the Word of God - that is the only way you can maintain your miracle.
    <br>People complain that their miracle is lost.
    <br>Why won't your miracle be lost when the Word is not  the standard for your life?
    <br>The Word must be the standard for your life.
    <br>If the Word has not been the standard for your life, you can also receive healing
    <br>but immediately you receive from Him, let the Word be the standard for your life to maintain it.
    <br>That is the only way you can maintain it.
    <br>The one who gave you should be the one to maintain you.
    <br>If Jesus gives, Jesus should be the One to maintain.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Fine, man of God.
    <br>We are seeing you here today; you are welcome.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>What message do you have concerning your coming here?
    <br>The message I have is that God is here, from what I have been seeing on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>How do you know that God is here?
    <br>How do you know God is inviting you?
    <br>Have you received God's invitation ?
    <br>My spirit tells me that God invited me here, and He made it possible for me to be here.
    <br>You spirit tells you?
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Where is the invitation?
    <br>Where is the invitation given to you to come?
    <br>It is spiritual.
    <br>It is my conviction.
    <br>Thank you, you are welcome.
    <br>Well, in some occasions too, if you are not invited and you go there, you may be received.
    <br>You would be received. It is not only invited people that enter the hall or are being attended to.
    <br>You may not be having an invitation but you go to the occasion and be received.
    <br>So, if you do not have God's invitation to come here and you come,
    <br>after He has attended to you, you have to submit to God.
    <br>If  not, it is all a waste.
    <br>There is no way you can maintain what you have received from God without God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>There is no way you can maintain what you have received from God without God.
    <br>In the world, you can receive something from A and run to B to maintain it.
    <br>In the case of Jesus, once you receive something from Him,
    <br>He should be the One to maintain it for you.
    <br>If not, you will loose it.
    <br>This is why we run helter-skelter today.
    <br>You were there yesterday but where are you today?
    <br>You think you can rob Him.
    <br>It's all for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Be ready to stay with Him for maintenance.
    <br>You lack maintenance;
    <br>stay with Him for maintenance.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Stay with Him for maintenance.
    <br>Again.
    <br>Stay with Him for maintenance.
    <br>Because the blessing of Jesus attracts attack.
    <br>The healing of Jesus attracts attack.
    <br>The breakthrough from Jesus attracts attack.
    <br>When you receive the healing now, attack would be looking for you.
    <br>The healing is like honey.
    <br>Once you are given that honey, insects seek it and find it.
    <br>You will see insects looking for it without invitation.
    <br>So, He must be the One to maintain that honey for you.
    <br>You cannot maintain it; only Him can maintain it.
    <br>Let God's Word be the standard for your life.
    <br>Thank you.
