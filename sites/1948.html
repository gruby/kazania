    <br>Those viruses in their internal organs -
    <br>be flushed out!
    <br>Those viruses in their organs -
    <br>be flushed out!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>I purge your organs!
    <br>I purge your system!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Never a sickness, never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
