    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>We have seen the power of God working in the Spirit.
    <br>We have seen the Word of God working in the Spirit.
    <br>We have seen the name, Jesus working in the Spirit.
    <br>With His power, nothing is impossible.
    <br>Right now, give thanks to Him.
    <br>If it is not possible for you, you are not ready.
    <br>If you are ready - nothing!
    <br>Say, nothing.
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>Now we know what it means to have a relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Before this relationship can happen, we need deliverance.
    <br>Let us go into deliverance.
    <br>If there is any chain satan might have used,
    <br>if there is any connection or any influence
    <br>satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>influence or connection,
    <br>whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>he is the architect of pain, the cause of pain.
    <br>He is behind the pain;
    <br>he is responsible for pain.
    <br>If there is anything satan used to connect you to himself,
    <br>that situation you are complaining about - satan is behind it.
    <br>That limitation, pain, sickness, disease - satan is behind it.
