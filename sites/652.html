  <p>    
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you were joining them dancing.
    <br>There is nothing anybody can do.
    <br>That is your belief.
    <br>Your belief is solid.
    <br>I say your belief is solid because you are acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are some people here that while many here were dancing, they were doing like this.
    <br>Why?
    <br>They were trying to act on what God had not spoken.
    <br>When you are trying to act on what God has not spoken,
    <br>you force yourself to believe in what God has not spoken
    <br>that is not believing.
    <br>You are dreaming, acting on your own imagination.
    <br>We need to know God's will and act accordingly.
    <br>If I allow you again, you are ready.
    <br>So, I have to congratulate you for your belief.
    <br>The word belief - believing is simply acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>It makes believing very simple.
    <br>What kind of belief are we talking about?
    <br>Many of us spend two to three days in connecting flights - from one country to another.
    <br>It is difficult nowadays, it is not easy.
    <br>When you fly from one country to another, it is stop-over.
    <br>You may spend three days there.
    <br>We have many people like that here.
    <br>You have paid some price.
    <br>God is aware.
    <br>I can’t hear you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I can’t hear you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You are actually here because you believe God has promised you.
    <br>If your Father promised to give you something and you base your belief on that,
    <br>that believing is solid.
    <br>I’m not talking of your father at home: I’m talking of God.
    <br>If your Father promised you something and you now base your belief on that,
    <br>this believing is solid.
    <br>This is why we need to know God’s will and act accordingly.
    <br>We need to know God’s promise and act according to His will.
    <br>If you don’t know God's promise, you want healing and you just say, "God, heal me, heal me",
    <br>you may have some problem because you need to know
    <br>whether it is the will of God to heal you at that moment or not - before you open your mouth.
    <br>We know His will before we pray.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If you see any prayer that is answered - let there be light and there is light -
    <br>the person knows God will bring light before he offers his prayer.
    <br>This actually affects our faith.
    <br>Today you don’t know whether you’re a man of faith or not. You don’t know.
    <br>You consider your relationship with God according to the number of prayers that are answered.
    <br>If your prayer is answered, you say, "Oh! God loves me".
    <br>God loves everyone.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>If your Father promised you something and you base your belief on that promise,
    <br>this believing is solid.
    <br>When your Father has not promised you, you force yourself to believe -
    <br>you are not believing but dreaming because you believe in something that is not factual.
    <br>I want to take it back again. The word believing is a difficult issue.
    <br>Believing is between you and salvation.
    <br>Believing is made easy when you know that it is acting on what God has promised,
    <br>on what God has said.
    <br>That is, you must know His will.
    <br>This is why we say, "Let the will of God be done!"
    <br>Do you really mean what you are talking about?
    <br>If it is the will of God to be done in your life and you want to step out for something,
    <br>you must know God will's about it.
    <br>It is when you know God’s will that you can act accordingly to His will before you pray.
    <br>This is why we need to know God’s will and act accordingly.
    <br>It is a prophetic word to your life.
    <br>Take it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How do you express your belief?
    <br>You have not based your belief on what God has said.
    <br>You base your belief on what you want, what you are looking for, what you want.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Not on what God has said or what God will do.
    <br>That is why your belief seems to be dreaming.
    <br>You know when you’re dreaming of something,
    <br>it may happen in one year's time or be a kind of imagination.
    <br>Such belief is not factual.
    <br>You are dreaming out of your imagination.
    <br>This is what is happening to us today.
    <br>If God has not promised you something and you force yourself, which today...
    <br>If I did not know God’s will, I would have joined you in the kind of prayer you want to offer.
    <br>But I’m going to pray according to God’s will.
    <br>This is why we are going to receive.
    <br>If I shall allow you to offer your prayer, you would continue to force your belief
    <br>on what God has not said.
    <br>If God has not promised and you force yourself to believe,
    <br>such belief is not factual,
    <br>you are dreaming out of your imagination.
    <br>This is what is happening to us today.
    <br>Everything satan tries to bring in order to destroy us is an advantage to us.
    <br>If satan brings headache, it’s an opportunity to pray the more.
    <br>If satan brings anger, opportunity to move closer to God.
    <br>Hallelujah. Rise up! Thank You, Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The way and manner God arranged this ministry:
    <br>He arranged it in such a way that it will be very difficult for you to come here without you having faith.
    <br>Ninety to ninety-nine have seen the finger of God before they leave.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In summary again:
    <br>God’s promise must be known to us before we pray.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>God’s promise must be known to us before we pray.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>God’s promise must be known to us before we pray.
    <br>If not, you will continue to be disappointed.
    <br>You will not even know the difference between a miracle and when a strange thing happens.
    <br>If you don’t know God’s promise and you offer prayer,
    <br>when something strange happens, you call it answer from God.
    <br>God’s promise means God’s will.
    <br>In the Bible, anywhere you see God’s promise means God’s will.
    <br>When we know God's will, we act according to His will.
    <br>This is why we say, "Let the will of God be done!"
    <br>This is the problem we are facing today.
    <br>Simply because we cannot define the word faith.
    <br>They cannot.
    <br>Faith is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is honest, reliable, trustworthy.
    <br>It means we are not looking for great faith but great God.
    <br>Great God!
    <br>Who is that ‘other party’?
    <br>Who is reliable in the world?
    <br>Who is trustworthy?
    <br>It is One that has no beginning and no end that can be trusted.
    <br>Faith is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is honest, reliable, trustworthy.
    <br>Where our trouble lies as a Christian is in the word belief.
    <br>The word believe.
    <br>And the word faith.
    <br>Faith and believe. This is just the problem we have.
    <br>There is power in our mouth.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith.
    <br>"Let there be light!" - to release that power, I need faith to release it.
    <br>Faith is a Heavenly resource.
    <br>If you need Heavenly resources, it is faith you use.
    <br>Like if you need to buy something, you need dollar, naira, rand.
    <br>You take money and purchase it.
    <br>Now, you want to get Heavenly things like healing, deliverance, all of God's blessings, salvation,
    <br>you need faith to purchase them.
    <br>They are all Heavenly resources.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It means that faith can be regarded as a Heavenly currency that purchases Heavenly resources.
    <br>It’s not everything that you can buy with 5 dollars.
    <br>You can't use 5 dollars to buy things costing 10 dollars.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You now understand the word faith.
    <br>Faith is a Heavenly currency.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Faith is a Heavenly currency.
    <br>What you are able to achieve, depends on the amount of Heavenly currency you have.
    <br>The Heavenly resources you are able to receive depend on the Heavenly currencies you have.
    <br>You cannot purchase more than what you have.
    <br>Faith grows as we continue to read, hear and obey - it grows.
    <br>Tell you neighbour: "Allow your faith to grow".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Allow your faith to grow
    <br>so that you can purchase greater Heavenly resources.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
