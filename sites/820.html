  <p>    
    <br>There is a woman outside there, you are pregnant.
    <br>Right now, you are due to deliver a baby.
    <br>This is almost three children that when you deliver them,
    <br>when they are just a baby, they die.
    <br>When they just make... - they die immediately.
    <br>So, you have this one now. The child is due. This is a baby boy.
    <br>She is outside there, under the canopy.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Here we can see the woman the prophecy concerned coming forward
    <br>from under the canopies at the overflow congregation.
    <br>Just as the man of God had prophecied,
    <br>the woman was sitting outside the auditorium under the canopies and was pregnant.
    <br>She makes her way up the stairs, heading inside the main auditorium of the church
    <br>to honour and confirm the word of prophecy,
    <br>that there was a woman pregnant with a baby boy outside the church, her delivery was due.
    <br>And in the past, she had given birth to children who had all died shortly after birth.
    <br>Inside the church, she moves towards the altar to meet Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>- This is your wife?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Well done.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>The reason why I said well done is that Jesus has the solution.
    <br>Well done.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Stretching his right hand, the man of God prays for her in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Immediately, there is a visible reaction in the woman,
    <br>as Prophet T.B. Joshua offers prayer under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>This is prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit right now.
    <br>Watch what's happening!
    <br>Watch and see her expression!
    <br>You can tell something extraordinary is happening to her.
    <br>From the look on her face, you can see she is not comfortable.
    <br>Look at her stomach jumping!
    <br>Watch your screen, see what's happening! Her stomach is moving!
    <br>This is the result of the prayer offered by Prophet T.B. Joshua just moments ago.
    <br>The child is turning.
    <br>It is the position the baby has been coming out with.
    <br>Before that baby was coming out, a lot of wrestle.
    <br>The doctor had been wrestling, the nurse had been wrestling.
    <br>Before the baby came out, it had become tired and died.
    <br>But this time around, it has to reposition.
    <br>It will come out straight.
    <br>It's turning; before now, it was bottom.
    <br>But it's now turning right. It's coming out with the head.
    <br>When it finishes, you can take her to the hospital.
    <br>How do you feel? What is happening in your stomach?
    <br>My baby is rotating.
    <br>The baby is rotating? How?
    <br>Because you are the one carrying the baby. You know what's happening in your stomach.
    <br>The baby is rotating, turning like this.
    <br>- It is turning the body?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Rotating like this?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>IMPOSSIBLE: Baby Turns In Womb As Pastor Prays!!!
    <br>Any moment from now, you will feel something pushing,
    <br>something will come out like a little water burst; after that, the road is open.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>IMPOSSIBLE: Baby Turns In Womb As Pastor Prays!!!
    <br>The thing has come down now - the water I am talking about!
    <br>You can see the baby stopped moving
    <br>because it has finally repositioned.
    <br>She is free. Ok, take her to the toilet.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After receiving prayer and the Anointed Wristband from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the lady is led out of the main auditorium to go to the lavatories
    <br>and release the water that the man of God had prophesied about.
    <br>Waving and smiling, she is followed by her husband.
    <br>As she moves through the church, climbing up a short flight of stairs
    <br>she enters the lavatories, and proceeds to pass out the fluid.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>The woman came back with her bouncing baby boy to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations
    <br>to testify to the glory of God in confirmation of the prophecy
    <br>given to her by Prophet T.B. Joshua that she would deliver a baby boy without an operation.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our names are Mr & Mrs Kingsley.
    <br>The man of God prophesied to me that there was a woman here
    <br>who had delivered three children.
    <br>The first one survived, the second one died, and the third one died.
    <br>He said that the woman was outside, under the canopy,
    <br>and that the woman should come inside.
    <br>There is a woman outside there, you are pregnant.
    <br>Right now, you are due to deliver a baby.
    <br>This is almost three children that when you deliver them,
    <br>when they are just a baby, they die.
    <br>Immediately, I came inside and the man of God prophesied to me
    <br>that I had a baby boy in my womb
    <br>and the problem that caused the death of the children was prolonged labour.
    <br>And he said that I should go; the problem was solved.
    <br>He gave me the Anointed Wristband
    <br>and he said that something would burst from my stomach.
    <br>When he said that, he said I should go and that this baby would not die.
    <br>What is happening in your stomach?
    <br>My baby is rotating.
    <br>- It is turning his body?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Rotating like this?
    <br>- Yes.

    <br>Any moment from now, you will feel something pushing,
    <br>something will come out like a little water burst; after that, the road is open.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Everything the man of God said has come to pass.
    <br>After the prophecy, we left and went back to Imo State.
    <br>When we got to Imo State, I went to my doctor,
    <br>and my doctor said that he would book me for an operation
    <br>because of the problem I had been having.
    <br>I said, "No", that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua has broken the yoke
    <br>and that I was not going to do any operation.
    <br>I used the Anointing Wristband and prayed.
    <br>I told the doctor that I was not going to deliver this baby through an operation.
    <br>Immediately, he left me.
    <br>In the morning, I used the Anointing Wristband and prayed.
    <br>I put it on my stomach and said that
    <br>as far as the man of God prophesied that my baby was not going to die,
    <br>my baby is safe and secured by the hand of the Almighty God.
    <br>Before the doctor came, I delivered my baby so fast, without any operation
    <br>And this is the baby boy.
    <br>You can see that he's a baby boy.
    <br>Everything the man of God prophesied to my life is true.
    <br>The second baby died.
    <br>I didn't come out with the baby.
    <br>The third one died inside the labour room.
    <br>That was the prophecy I received.
    <br>And you can see that Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied this and it has manifested.
    <br>I am alive. My baby is alive.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Praise the living God!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our names are Mr & Mrs Kingsley; we came from Imo state, Nigeria.
    <br>During the second service, the man of God prophesied
    <br>that there was a woman outside, under the canopy,
    <br>that whenever she delivered a baby, the baby would cry and then die.
    <br>When I heard the prophecy, I told my wife that this was our prophecy and
    <br>that the Lord had remembered us.
    <br>Do you remember what I told you that day? How I made a joke...
    <br>You said, "Well done, Oga".
    <br>I said, "Well done, Oga".
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What's the meaning of that?
    <br>For a job well done because the stomach was too big.
    <br>After the prayer, I thank God today
    <br>because the Almighty God has used Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to bring laughter to my family and now, I have a baby boy.
    <br>He's my first son because the first son I had died.
    <br>But I am happy today because I have a son in the house.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
