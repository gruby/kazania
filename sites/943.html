    <br>The innocent 13-year-old girl from South Africa
    <br>has been brought to The SCOAN unable to walk due to a musculo-skeletal condition.
    <br>The medical report from The New Life Medical Centre attests to the fact that
    <br>little Miracle's movements are severely limited and that she is in constant pain.
    <br>As a result of the acute musculo-skeletal condition, she has to be co-managed
    <br>by a specialist of neurological unit in Botswana.
    <br>Due to her to her inability to walk by herself Miracle was brought to the church stretching out in a car.
    <br>Let's find out exactly what happened to this little girl who should be running about at play or in school,
    <br>and has led to this terrible condition of hardly being able to move at all.
    <br>My name is Khubai Miracle. I am 13 years old.
    <br>I come from South Africa.
    <br>I cannot walk due to musculo-skeletal condition.
    <br>It started when I was at school.
    <br>A teacher beat me on my leg; I couldn't walk, from there I collapsed.
    <br>I have been urinating on myself and messing myself for the past one month.
    <br>My mum has been by my side helping me.
    <br>I have not been doing anything.
    <br>I cannot stand, bend or sit down nicely.
    <br>I cannot go to the toilet by myself.
    <br>I always urinate on myself.
    <br>When my mum is not there, I cannot get to the toilet, I will mess myself on the bed.
    <br>But when my mum is here, she will always help me to go to the toilet.
    <br>I feel heart-broken and sad because this has affected my life.
    <br>I cannot go to school.
    <br>It is hard for me to carry my own things.
    <br>I cannot focus on schooling due to this problem that I have.
    <br>I sometimes cry, praying to God to help me walk.
    <br>I have gone to all hospitals both in Botswana and South Africa.
    <br>I have gone to all sorts of churches - no solution.
    <br>I came to know about The SCOAN by watching it on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw people in wheelchairs getting healed.
    <br>I believe that Jesus will heal me and I will be an example to all other kids.
    <br>My name is Augusta Nkechinyere. I am from Mbaise, Imo state.
    <br>I stayed in South Africa.
    <br>She is my daughter, my only child.
    <br>She has a musculo-skeletal problem.
    <br>She is unable to walk since the teacher flogged her at school.
    <br>She fainted and started passing through this problem.
    <br>She has not been walking, she cannot open her legs, fold them or sit.
    <br>She cannot go to the toilet.
    <br>If I am not there she urinates on herself.
    <br>It has even affected my job.
    <br>I have taken her to so many hospitals in South Africa and Botswana and even to some churches.
    <br>There was no solution.
    <br>I always watch Emmanuel TV; I even sleep with it on.
    <br>I saw how the man of God is healing people in wheelchairs and cases worse than hers.
    <br>I believe that this is the place where my daughter will be healed.
    <br>I believe that the God of T.B. Joshua will heal my daughter.
    <br>My daughter will not go back to South Africa like this with the same condition.
    <br>We pray with you that the Lord Jesus will use his able servant,  seniour Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to set your daughter free from this problem of inability to walk
    <br>due to musculoskeletal condition in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>I cannot walk due to getting beaten at school.
    <br>I got paralysed in my back and I can not walk due to musculoskeletal condition.
    <br>Man of God, please help me, I cannot walk!
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>I am 13 years old.
    <br>I am from South Africa. Man of God, please, help me; I cannot walk due to musculoskeletal condition.
    <br>That is my only child; she urinates on herself.
    <br>The teacher flogged her at school; she came back and collapsed.
    <br>She messes herself, she can not do anything.
    <br>I am the one who is bathing her, feeding her, doing everything.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer and Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>I can walk! Thank you, Jesus, I can walk!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>This is the power of prayer in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The evidence of God's miracle in this little girl's life is  her rising and walking.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>And right now we can see our sister is here in our midst  walking to the glory of God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>My name is Khubai Miracle.
    <br>I am 13 years old and I come from South Africa. I am South African citizen residing in Botswana.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is that I could not walk due to musculoskeletal condition.
    <br>This has affected my life in a way that I could not do things by myself.
    <br>I would always urinate on myself.
    <br>No one was there to help me. The only person that was there to help me is my mum.
    <br>And every time I would look at other kids there, they will be walking, playing around and
    <br>this really hurts because I couldn't manage to do what the other kids were doing out there.
    <br>So we saw what happened when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.
    <br>Can you just describe to us - at that moment, what happened in your body, as he prayed for you?
    <br>As he prayed for me, I felt my body - the chain was breaking into pieces.
    <br>I could not feel any chain that was locking my legs again.
    <br>People of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So you mean when you came in, it was like your legs were locked together, as if they were in chains.
    <br>But the moment Prophet T.B. Joshua  prayed for you, you felt as if the chains were broken
    <br>and you began to walk.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Glory be to God! And ever since then, just tell us - it has been one week now.
    <br>What are the changes you have seen in your body, in your life?
    <br>I can now do all the things by myself. I can bath myself.
    <br>I can bend down, I can sit down, I can walk.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We can see the joy of the Lord on our sister's face.
    <br>We can see what she can now do that she couldn't do before due to this musculoskeletal condition.
    <br>We can see her moving freely. This someone that actually came in a vehicle because
    <br>she was unable to walk by herself but today we see to the glory of God that she is freed.
    <br>And sister, what is your word of advice to viewers around the world?
    <br>Before I say my advice, I would like to thank daddy, seniour Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for healing me. May God give him more strength.
    <br>I would like to thank the workers out there. May God give them strength to do more work.
    <br>Miss Kubhai Miracle Healed Of Inability To Walk
    <br>My advice is that you should always have faith in God.
    <br>Believe in God because you should always know that God is always by your side.
    <br>No matter your problems, no matter anything that is wronging you in your life.
    <br>Believe in God. He will change your life.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My name is Augusta Nkechinyere. I am a Nigerian residing in Botswana.
    <br>The beautiful girl that's standing beside me is my beloved daughter, my only child.
    <br>I am so happy for what God used seniour Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in her life.
    <br>I am so happy. I don't know how to express my feelings.
    <br>All my friends both in Botswana, South Africa - they were calling, they were happy, even my parents.
    <br>I'm so happy.
    <br>My advice to the whole world is that you should have faith in God. Believe in God.
    <br>Believe that there is nothing that God can not do. Now my daughter can do everything.
    <br>She can bath herself, she can feed herself, she can walk around, sit, sing, dance. She is so happy.
    <br>She is very very happy. All the things that she has not been able to do before ,
    <br>now she is doing everything.
    <br>Wow, so before you were the one assisting her to do everything, even to go to the toilet.
    <br>Yes, I was the one assisting her with my sister.
    <br>She is the one always helping me to assist her. Anywhere she is now, she is watching.
    <br>Let God fulfill all her heart desires for her, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>So we give glory to God for the wonderful transformation in the life of our little sister here
    <br>and we pray that God will give you all the grace to continue to stay close to Jesus,
    <br>make His Word the standard for your life and we know that this family is coming back with
    <br>even more wonderful testimonies in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>After Miracle was healed by God Almighty from the musculoskeletal disorder that had rendered
    <br>her unable to walk, she and her mother were supported by Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and Emmanuel TV Partners with the sum of $2,000.
    <br>My name is Khubai Miracle
    <br>I am 13 years old. I am a South African citizen residing in Botswana.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is that I could not walk due to musculoskeletal condition.
    <br>My daddy seniour Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me - now I can walk and I'm very happy.
    <br>My name is Augusta Nkechinyere. I'm Nigerian. I'm from Mbaise.

    <br>I am so happy. My heart is full of joy. Full of happiness.
    <br>Amen. Thank you very much. And right now as we all know what The SCOAN stands for.
    <br>The man of God in his usual kind gesture in line with Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world
    <br>has actually been touched by the healing of your daughter and said he wouldn't just
    <br>allow her to go that way without giving her the necessary support for her upkeep.
    <br>That is why the man of God has decided with Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world to give
    <br>you and your daughter the sum of $2000.
    <br>Overflowing with joy and gratitude to God for the transformation in their lives,
    <br>Miracle and her mother gladly receive the gift of $2000 and the Mirror book to nurture them
    <br>materially and spiritually.
    <br>Thank you, Emmanuel TV. Thank you, seniour Prophet T.B. Joshua. Thank you for what you have done for us.
    <br>You have given me a new life. God will reward you, God will bless you,
    <br>protect you, guide you, give you more strength to do this job.
    <br>I came with a problem with my daughter, God used you to deliver her, to heal her.
    <br>I didn't pay anything, I didn't spend anything the way I have been going to all the hospitals, to other churches -
    <br>they charged me. I spent money, now I didn't pay anything.
    <br>And look at what he gave me. He gave me the sum of $2000 to support my daughter.
    <br>He even paid for our accommodation, feeding us since we came.
    <br>Now we are going back, he supported us with the sum of $2000.
    <br>Amen. Thank you very much. And the man of God did not only want to stop at this point in time.
    <br>And he said he wants to give your daughter scholarship from the very stage she is right now
    <br>in her educational level to university level.
    <br>I'm speechless, I don't know how to thank him. I don't know how to thank man of God.
    <br>I don't know how to thank him. May the good Lord bless him for me. He has done a lot for me.
    <br>He saved my life. He saved me by giving my daughter a scholarship and the sum of $2000.
    <br>Which is a big relief for me which I did not even expect.
    <br>I have not even dreamt about it. He has done something that nobody can ever do for me.
    <br>I'm so happy. Thank you, daddy, thank you. May God bless you. Thank you, daddy. I love you.
    <br>I would also like to sing a song.
    <br>Never give up
    <br>No, never
    <br>Never
    <br>No, no never
    <br>Never give up
    <br>In times of troubles, in times of sorrows 
    <br>No, never
    <br>No, never 
    <br>Never give up
    <br>Miss Khubai & Mother With 2000$
