    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>During the Living Water Service at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>people have come with their petitions for God's intervention.
    <br>Indeed the presence of God begins to manifest
    <br>as people are delivered from their bondages.
    <br>The sick receive their healing,
    <br>and the presence of God is revealed through revelation.
    <br>- It's too much!
    <br>- Why are you covering your eyes?
    <br>I'm seeing Someone standing there - He's wearing white.
    <br>White and tall -
    <br>by the cross there.
    <br>That cross there!
    <br>There are two crosses.
    <br>This one this side.
    <br>A tall man - the man standing there wearing white is Jesus.
    <br>He's cleaning this one's mother's house
    <br>and He's cleaning everyone.
    <br>He wants them to believe that "I am the Messiah,
    <br>the Lord, the King of Kings.
    <br>I am the Lord, the King of Kings.
    <br>Some they're here - they don't believe.
    <br>That's why I opened this one's eyes to see who I am.
    <br>Everyone who is here will never lack anymore."
    <br>Now tell us, why are you closing your eyes?
    <br>No, it's too bright!
    <br>It's too bright; I cannot take it
    <br>So you're seeing Him right now?
    <br>I'm seeing Him right now even when I am covering my eyes.
    <br>By the cross?
    <br>That cross is too close.
    <br>Tell us once again, how does He look like?
    <br>He's tall, white.
    <br>"I am sending the message to all of you standing and sitting here, that I am the Messiah!
    <br>Believe the God of T.B. Joshua!
    <br>He is my son."
    <br>As soon as this lady stepped onto the Mountain of Prayer,
    <br>God opened her eyes to see what the ordinary eyes could not see.

    <br>Watch and see what is happening.
    <br>SCOAN Altar Experience
    <br>There was someone there, very tall and white
    <br>There was someone there?
    <br>That cross there.
    <br>The cross on the left there?
    <br>Yes, this one.
    <br>Can you describe to us what you were seeing.
    <br>He was saying, " I am the Messiah! Everyone who is here will not lack.
    <br>They must believe in the God of T.B. Joshua."
    <br>Tell us - as you were seeing this and listening to this message, what was this person doing?
    <br>He was cleaning everybody and busy touching them.
    <br>He was just touching people?
    <br>He was touching them fast.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Lucy Tembo and I'm from Zambia living in South Africa, Capetown.
    <br>At the Living Water Service, I was sitting at the back in the last row.
    <br>I was meditating in my heart, "Take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>I'm a person that sometimes just reads the Bible when I have bad dreams.
    <br>Even coming here, it was my friend who forced me.
    <br>When I wanted to phone the coordinator, I would say, "I will phone later".
    <br>Sometimes I would hear a voice telling me, "You know what? 
    <br>Keep this money, sell the car you are having and then use this money to buy a bigger car".
    <br>Then my friend just called me and said, "Listen. I am at The SCOAN.
    <br>She said, "I am going to help you fill the form".
    <br>She helped me fill the form on the phone and that's when I started the procedure.
    <br>I just came to The SCOAN; I said, "Ah, let me go".
    <br>When I came here, at the Living Water Service,
    <br>as I was coming, something was telling me, "Don't go inside there".
    <br>The other one was like, "No", and one of my legs was not moving,
    <br>I did not want to enter there.
    <br>It was the ushers who pushed me in.
    <br>After they had pushed me in, I felt like something hit my eyes.
    <br>I couldn't look at the left cross there.
    <br>I saw someone tall.
    <br>The person started telling me, "I am the Lord, God, the Messiah!
    <br>Everyone who is here - some do not believe - they must believe, I am the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>They must believe in the God of T.B. Joshua."
    <br>The person was touching everyone fast.
    <br>I have never seen that movement and I couldn't look at the person
    <br>because the light was too bright.
    <br>God Almighty visited me, I have never seen something like that in my life!
    <br>This revelation that God showed you, how does that affect you?
    <br>It has affected me because now I know there is God
    <br>and this world is not our own, there is God in this world.
    <br>He is the one controlling the whole world
    <br>because I had never seen something like that, it was a shock for me!
    <br>I said, "Wow! A person like me who doesn't even read the Bible.
    <br>How come I can see Jesus just like that?"
    <br>SCOAN Altar Experience
    <br>Ever since then, I am calm.
    <br>I just feel like reading the Word of God.
    <br>Even the faith bracelet - something is pushing me, "It is time now, take it!"
    <br>Then I take my faith bracelet and pray with it.
    <br>I know now that I am free and I feel light like a normal person
    <br>and I am now enjoying reading my Bible.
    <br>To God be the glory. Let us put our hands together beautifully for Christ Jesus.
    <br>My advice to the viewers all over the world and the congregation here is that
    <br>as for me, a person who read the Bible only when I had a bad dream
    <br>and then God visited me here, so just believe that you are here and God is also here.
