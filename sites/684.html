    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The brother under the canopy - your wife is at home but you are here with a lady.
    <br>What kind of prayer you want to offer?
    <br>What do you hear us preaching since morning?
    <br>Your wife is at home. She is even trying to cook food for you but you are here with one lady.
    <br>For salvation or for what?
    <br>For marriage.
    <br>If you don't come out, you are here to tempt me.
    <br>If you tempt the man of God, you know the repercussion. You have to come out, please.
    <br>Salvation first.
    <br>You will not be able to help yourself.
    <br>God loves you. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>This man comes forward in response to the prophecy of the man of God.
    <br>Man of God, I am the man who came here with my girlfriend while my wife is at home.
    <br>What has your wife done to you?
    <br>She didn't do anything.
    <br>And she's beautiful - you like her?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is urge.
    <br>I came with the girl. The girl is my girlfriend in Angola.
    <br>Where is the girl?
    <br>She is at the back.
    <br>No, respect others. This is the man I called.
    <br>After the service, I want to see you and her.
    <br>Okay? I want to see her because you are the cause.
    <br>We are going to ask God the way out.
    <br>Thank you, my brother.
    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Kelechukwu John.
    <br>The woman beside me is my wife, Chioma John.
    <br>I'm the one the man of God prophesied about last Sunday that I came with my girlfriend.
    <br>It started in Angola.
    <br>When I newly got there, I met her and she said that she would help me and give me documents.
    <br>That's why we started.
    <br>Whenever she came to my house, we would like to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>She said that she liked the man of God and would one day like to visit Nigeria.
    <br>Two Fridays ago, she called me saying that she was in Cotonou,
    <br>that I should come and pick her up.
    <br>I went to pick her up and brought her to The SCOAN
    <br>and the man of God gave us a prophecy.
    <br>After the prophecy, I realised my mistakes.
    <br>I'm sorry, Man of God, for doing such a thing.
    <br>I am also pleading for my wife to forgive me because she did not know anything about it.
    <br>My wife trusted me and did not think that I would do such a thing.
    <br>Man of God, I am sorry; forgive me for what I did.
    <br>She asked me about my wife and I told her that the man of God had invited my wife.
    <br>She said that she could not stand the challenge and went back.
    <br>So your girlfriend has actually left now after hearing that the man of God was inviting your wife?
    <br>She left.
    <br>Right now as your wife is here, what do you want to say to your wife?
    <br>All I want to say is that she should forgive me for what I did. I'm sorry, baby.
    <br>We thank God. Our brother said that after the word of prophecy, he realised his mistake.
    <br>That it was as if his eyes opened.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for how that word of prophecy not only brought our sister here
    <br>but also brought deliverance to our brother who was having a girlfriend all the way in Angola.
    <br>Let's just hear a word from our sister.
    <br>Madam, you're welcome. Just introduce yourself to us.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chioma Kelechukwu.
    <br>I am from Nigeria.
    <br>On Tuesday, I got a call that the man of God and Emmanuel TV team wanted to see me.
    <br>I came and they explained what was happening.
    <br>I was surprised and did not know what to do.
    <br>I trusted my husband and did not think that he could do such a thing.
    <br>Nevertheless, to God be the glory, I got my deliverance at The SCOAN.
    <br>I thank God and Emmanuel TV for helping me recover my home.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give glory to the Lord God Almighty that this prophecy came forth.
    <br>As you are standing here right now in the presence of God, madam, what do you want to say to your husband?
    <br>I have forgiven him!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>I advise every home to know God first so that God will help you recover your family.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Kelechukwu John 
    <br>(Prophecy Confirmation)
    <br>Hallelujah. Once again, madam, for the benefit of our viewers,
    <br>as you're standing here in the presence of God now, what do you want to say to your husband?
    <br>Who am I? I have already forgiven him.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Glory be to God. We know that if not for God's intervention,
    <br>an issue like this could have easily led to many things - talk of divorce, separation or whatever.
    <br>But we thank God that as God revealed it, He also redeemed this marriage,
    <br>and we thank Jesus Christ for what He has done.
    <br>We want to hear a final word from our brother as well.
    <br>My advice to every couple is that there is no need to look outside -
    <br>stay with your wife, place your hope in her and do everything with her.
    <br>Amen. Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God for your life, sir,
    <br>and we pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this resolution you've made right now.
    <br>As you here in the presence of God, we know your past is over
    <br>and we believe you and your wife will come back with a wonderful testimony, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
