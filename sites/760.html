  <p>    
    <br>It is time to begin to come against every challenge in our lives.
    <br>You demon, you familiar spirit, you spirit that kills, steals and destroys -
    <br>anywhere you are, your name is demon.
    <br>Anywhere you are, your name is familiar spirit.
    <br>You kill, you steal, you destroy -
    <br>I order you right now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You demon!
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Bring them out!
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am his wife.
    <br>I want to kill this boy.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am a spirit of snake.
    <br>I came to see the powers of this man of God; I came to challenge.
    <br>I am the snake - the great python.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The evil spirit that said that it came to challenge the man of God
    <br>now crawls slowly towards Prophet T.B. Joshua on his belly - just like a snake.
    <br>But satan is powerless in the face of God's armour and weapons.
    <br>The evil spirit has no choice than to follow the command of the man of God.
    <br>He wriggles and slithers along the ground,
    <br>seeming surprised by the authority and power endowed in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>For when the power of God is present, satan has to listen.
    <br>The evil spirit tries to display its power
    <br>but instantly falls at the command of the man of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Emmanuel Dickson. I'm from Bayelsa State, Nigeria.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN two weeks ago
    <br>and I was delivered from the spirit of snake and spiritual wife.
    <br>In my early days I stayed with my mum
    <br>because when I grew up as a child, I didn't see my mum and dad as husband and wife.
    <br>At my mother's place, in those days, people worshipped idols.
    <br>Anybody from there knows that the people there worshipped idols - specifically snakes.
    <br>When I was eight, I came in contact with a girl who lived in the same compound as me.
    <br>The girl was older than me.
    <br>My mother went to work and that evening, she went fishing,
    <br>while I stayed with my younger ones.
    <br>The lady came to me and told me that she wanted to sleep with me.
    <br>She said that I should go with her to her house and I followed her
    <br>because she was older than me.
    <br>I didn't have a choice and did whatever she told me.
    <br>I did everything that she asked me.
    <br>After I finished everything, that night, I saw myself in a big ocean where I was alone.
    <br>There was no one. I was just swimming in the ocean until I woke up.
    <br>That was how it all started.
    <br>From there, I started having the spirit of snake
    <br>and a lady would come to me in my dreams.
    <br>Whenever I slept, I saw myself in the ocean, swimming like a snake,
    <br>and doing all sorts of things in the spiritual world.
    <br>Physically, there was a day when a very big python came to me while I was sleeping.
    <br>The python slithered past me.
    <br>I thought that it was something like water that touched me because it was cold.
    <br>When I woke up, I just saw the tail of a snake passing me.
    <br>You saw the snake physically?
    <br>I saw the snake physically but I did not tell anyone. No one knows about it.
    <br>I just lived with it like that .
    <br>From there, I started being possessed by the spirits of lust, anger and stealing.
    <br>At a point, I told my mother that I wanted to go to my father's side
    <br>since she and my father were not together.
    <br>My mother took me to my father's side.
    <br>When I went to my father's place, the spirits followed me.
    <br>All my brothers knew that when I got angry, it would be extreme
    <br>and I would steal and do all sorts of things.
    <br>I moved like a python and in my dreams, I was a python.
    <br>I could travel for very long distances on my stomach.
    <br>I would just creep along the ground.
    <br>In the dream, what kind of destructive activities would you see yourself carrying out
    <br>in that form of a snake - a python?
    <br>In the dream, most of the time I would fight with people a lot.
    <br>Sometimes, when a person offended me and they were more powerful than me in the physical,
    <br>I would just keep quiet, although I would be angry but within me,
    <br>I believed that I would see you in the dream and we would fight there.
    <br>Most of the time, I would fight with people and I would always defeat them.
    <br>So the same person that physically offended you, spiritually you would see yourself
    <br>as a snake and go and attack that person in the dream?
    <br>Most of the time I would see my normal self
    <br>but the power in me pushed me to do as the spirit would lead me.
    <br>So we can understand from what our brother is saying that right from a young age,
    <br>this spirit of snake was within him.
    <br>Now brother, you said that this spirit specifically led you to the spirits of lust, anger and stealing.
    <br>Can you just explain the area of lust - how severe was this?
    <br>The spirit of lust made me lust after any girl I saw that I liked.
    <br>I would sleep with any girl that came my way.
    <br>I would sleep with them just like that.
    <br>For some of them, if I was not able to sleep with them because we fought or didn't agree,
    <br>in the spirit, their picture would appear like a mirror to me,
    <br>they would be naked and I would sleep with them.
    <br>For most, I wouldn't communicate further with them and I would not see them again.
    <br>The ones I went into a relationship with got depression
    <br>and didn't do well academically, they would become confused.
    <br>They would tell me that they loved me and fell in love with me seriously.
    <br>Sometimes, I couldn't understand the kind of love they had for me.
    <br>Those were the kinds of things they would pass through.
    <br>So you mean to say, brother, that these ladies that you slept with because of the power
    <br>that was within you as a snake, at the end of the day, their lives would end up
    <br>facing confusion, destruction, academic challenges, everything?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I grew up, I was intimidated by so many of my age mates.
    <br>Sometimes, people who were bigger than me, who had power,
    <br>some had finances that they could do whatever they wanted.
    <br>When they intimidated me, it hurt me a lot, to the point where I did not know what to do.
    <br>The only way I could fight back was through the spirit, through the power in me.
    <br>The power in me would always push me to the extent where I wanted to fight and destroy.
    <br>Because of the intimidation, I wanted to acquire power physically.
    <br>If you came to me physically, I could fight you physically and destroy everything about you.
    <br>That was the mind that came to me, a very strong mind of what to do.
    <br>In 2012, I got admission into a university in South Africa.
    <br>When I went there, through the spirit, I was led to the internet to read about the Illuminati,
    <br>the anti-Christ and the greatest powers in this world.
    <br>Through it, I learnt about how they control the world,
    <br>how they control human beings physically and spiritually.
    <br>I learnt a lot.
    <br>I was trying to go deeper so that my eyes would open physically and spiritually.
    <br>When I started chasing these demonic things, my life became even worse
    <br>because I couldn't cope with my studies anymore.
    <br>Instead of me to enjoy reading my books, I would enjoy reading all those things
    <br>about Illuminati, anti-Christ and all that stuff.
    <br>Sometimes, I would spend four to five hours reading about them as I enjoyed it.
    <br>But for my books, I could not even sit for thirty minutes to read them.
    <br>It really affected me and gave me confusion and depression. I was always having headaches.
    <br>It controlled every bit of my life.
    <br>Because of the interest I had in those things, I downloaded some of their pictures.
    <br>The reason I downloaded them was so that after reading about them, I would visualise them.
    <br>I downloaded the pictures on my laptop and began to enjoy looking at them.
    <br>When I looked at them, I would be comforted.
    <br>If I was angry, I would go to my room, look at these pictures and I would relax.
    <br>I was going to church because I used to sing in church
    <br>but the moment I started reading about this stuff and keeping these pictures in my house
    <br>and on my laptop, I stopped going to church.
    <br>I didn't even want to hear anything about church; it turned me against church.
    <br>Sometimes, my friends in church would call me, the people I used to go to church with
    <br>and ask me if I was going to church, why was I not going to church.
    <br>I would give them unnecessary excuses which they also found difficult to accept.
    <br>But because of the things in me, I didnt even want to go to church or hear anything about it.
    <br>I tried to go to church but I felt bored.
    <br>I spent two hours there but felt that it was too long for me to spend in a church.
    <br>When you came to The SCOAN two weeks ago, just explain what happened at that period.
    <br>The main reason why I came to the church was to see the man of God.
    <br>I had been seeing him on the internet via YouTube where I usually watched him
    <br>and followed him up.
    <br>When I came back to Nigeria, I decided to come to see him face to face.
    <br>When he started the prayer, I was outside. So, I came in for the prayer.
    <br>From the moment I came in, not up to 10 minutes,
    <br>I saw something like a light that came into my heart
    <br>and when it came into my chest, I could not control myself.
    <br>The spirit in me was telling me, "You can't disgrace me in this place".
    <br>I was trying to control myself, even the spirit was pushing me, but I tried to hold myself.
    <br>Something said, "No, you can't; you must be exposed".
    <br>My heart and my hands started vibrating very strongly.
    <br>I was just calculating when the ushers would leave so I could run away from the church.
    <br>The moment the ushers took a step to leave, I was about to run,
    <br>then I fell on the ground and started moving like a snake.
    <br>That was when I lost control, I didn't know what was happening -
    <br>whether I was going through deliverance or not, I didn't know.
    <br>At that point, the spirit in me was extremely angry; I felt like fighting.
    <br>That was why I was struggling with those men to leave me so I could fight.
    <br>When I approached the prophet after he had called me, there was a very bright, shining light.
    <br>I couldn't look up, I tried but the light was too much;
    <br>it was uncontrollable.
    <br>When he was calling me, I was coming but because of the light, I stopped.
    <br>He kept calling me to come.
    <br>I would stop, he kept calling me to come.
    <br>When he came to me, after I had moved closer to him, a spirit left me.
    <br>The moment the prophet moved close to me, I became weak,
    <br>the power in me was completely destroyed.
    <br>Mr Emmanuel Dickson
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean to say that as the evil spirit that was within you,
    <br>was moving you like a snake towards the prophet, attempting to attack him,
    <br>at that moment when you looked at him, what did you see?
    <br>I saw a kind of light I have never seen in my life.
    <br>I can't lie to you, I have never.
    <br>I didn't think that kind of light existed because it was a light that could not be described.
    <br>It was so much that I couldn't even look at him.
    <br>The man of God is extremely powerful.
    <br>Mr Emmanuel Dickson
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We thank God for our brother's deliverance from that spirit of snake
    <br>and we thank Jesus Christ that here he is today a living testimony.
    <br>Brother, what can you say about your life after your deliverance?
    <br>What are the changes you have immediately seen?
    <br>First of all, when I used to sleep before, the only place I would see myself was in the sea -
    <br>moving like a snake and if I was in the bush, I would move like different kinds of animals.
    <br>After the deliverance, when I got home and slept that night, it was like I was in Heaven
    <br>because I slept like a baby. I didn't dream, there was nothing.
    <br>Before, when the urge came, I could do anything at that point in time,
    <br>but after the deliverance, glory be to God, I can't find it anymore.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Brother, you said before as well that you always had such desire, interest
    <br>in looking at these kinds of demonic images and researching about these things.
    <br>What can you say about that after your deliverance?
    <br>When I went back to my hotel room, I deleted a lot of these pictures.
    <br>Even the porn - I had up to 20 ponographic videos on my laptop
    <br>that I watched from one to another to get pleasure.
    <br>The moment I got to my room, the first thing that came to my mind was to delete all those things.
    <br>I completely deleted all of them.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We believe now you are delivered, you are really in a position to advise people.
    <br>My advice is to my fellow youths:
    <br>I will advise them to be very careful.
    <br>When you go to the internet, have a purpose.
    <br>When I say a purpose, I mean not a bad intention.
    <br>Don't go there to look at these things because these things will not help you.
    <br>They will never take you anywhere, they will never promote you.
    <br>They will never help you in any area of your life.
    <br>The moment you go to the internet
    <br>and start looking at pictures like these, it will destroy you completely.
    <br>It will damage everything about your life.
    <br>It will turn you against your family, against God and anything you have worked for in this life.
    <br>My advice is: Please, don't go to the internet and start looking at these types of pictures,
    <br>or download things that have to do with the illuminati, anti-Christ and all that,
    <br>because they will never help you, they will destroy you.
    <br>If you are going there to research for your studies, just go there to research and leave the internet.
    <br>Don't waste your time on these things, because they are a waste
    <br>and will never help you in anyway in this life.
    <br>Parents should be concerned about their children.
    <br>You must know where you take your children to.
    <br>When your child shows a certain bad attitude or character,
    <br>don't just answer by beating - that will not solve the problem.
    <br>Pray to God and seek the face of God so that the child will not grow up being spoilt.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Mr Emmanuel Dickson
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Brother, we thank God for you life,
    <br>and we pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance
    <br>by making His Word the standard for your life
    <br>and we know the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
