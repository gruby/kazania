    <br>Right now, stretch your hand.
    <br>You demon, I order you to leave my people, right now.
    <br>I order you to leave my people!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>I order, in the name of Jesus, leave my people!
    <br>I order - with all your affliction,
    <br>with all your disease, with all your situation - leave my people!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to command that!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>There is fire in the house.
    <br>For you to be included, you must let your offence go.
    <br>When you hold an offence in your heart, you are not included.
    <br>There is miracle, there is healing, there is deliverance going on.
    <br>There is blessing going on -
    <br>greater blessing, salvation, deliverance, breakthrough are moving around.
    <br>The atmosphere is full of breakthrough.
    <br>The atmosphere is full of blessing.
    <br>The atmosphere is full of healing.
    <br>When you hold an offence, you are not included.
    <br>This is word for you before we move.
    <br>Think about it.
    <br>When you hold an offence in your heart, you are not included.
    <br>Watch your screen!
    <br>Do you see what is happening? That is the atmosphere we are in.
    <br>Atmosphere of healing,
    <br>atmosphere of miracle, breakthrough.
    <br>Now, when you hold an offence in your heart, you are not included.
    <br>Viewers at home, listen!
    <br>Right now, in your home, anywhere you are,
    <br>are you under the influence of my voice?
    <br>Here is miracle, here is deliverance, here is breakthrough.
    <br>Here is blessing, you can just tap it.
    <br>But when you hold an offence in your heart, you are not included.
    <br>Right now, deal with your offence.
    <br>Pain in the past - deep pain.
    <br>Begin to ask God to release you, ask for release.
    <br>Begin to release yourself from deep pain.
    <br>Not just pain - deep one.
    <br>There are some pains that are so deep: "Will I forget? Will I forgive?"
    <br>Deep pain...
    <br>Open your lips, begin to deal with this, viewers at home.
    <br>I am very, very sure that this offence has created a wall between you and God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Have you dealt with offence?
    <br>I connect your heart, I connect your spirit.
    <br>Every pain, every pain in the past, every deep pain -
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release you from every pain,
    <br>every insult,
    <br>every embarrassment,
    <br>every persecution,
    <br>every hatred.
    <br>Pain, pain in the past, deep bitterness - be released!
    <br>Confess: "I am released!"
    <br>Open your lips and begin to release yourself.
    <br>I am released, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>Ask yourself!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>Ask yourself: "Do I understand what is going on?"
    <br>I believe, you don't understand what is going on.

    <br>In Your presence
    <br>That's where I am strong
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>Oh Lord my God
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>That's where I belong
    <br>Seeking Your face
    <br>Touching Your grace
    <br>In the cleft of the rock
    <br>In Your presence oh God
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>That's where I am strong
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>Oh Lord my God
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>That's where I belong
    <br>Seeking Your face
    <br>Touching Your grace
    <br>In the cleft of the rock
    <br>In Your presence oh God
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>That's where I am strong
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>Oh Lord my God
    <br>In Your presence
    <br>That's where I belong
    <br>Seeking Your face
    <br>Touching Your grace
    <br>In the cleft of the rock
    <br>In Your presence oh God
    <br>Thank You, Lord. Give thanks to God, give thanks to Him!
    <br>Hallelujah, give thanks to Him!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Right now, be open to the Spirit of God.
    <br>Yes, He wants to contact you. He's concerned about you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Jesus is concerned about me".
    <br>Jesus is concerned about me!
    <br>He wants you to be like any apostle He has created.
    <br>He is concerned about you. He loves you.
    <br>He loves you so much - more than you love yourself.
    <br>Jesus loves you more than you love yourself.
    <br>He is concerned about you.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Right now, begin to take your career, business from where it is now to where Jesus wants it to be.
    <br>Open your lips right now. By faith, take your business, career, finances
    <br>from where they are now to where Jesus wants them to be.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I command breakthrough to your life!
    <br>Your business - breakthrough!
    <br>Your career - breakthrough!
    <br>I say, breakthrough!
    <br>Your effort - breakthrough!
    <br>Your attempt - breakthrough!
    <br>Your desire - breakthrough!
    <br>I say, breakthrough!
    <br>I want to hear you shout, "Breakthrough!"
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Jesus is not a man that lies.
    <br>If He says 'yes', no one can say 'no'.
    <br>If He says 'no', no one can say 'yes'.
    <br>Jesus says, 'Breakthrough!'
    <br>I just want to see your belief.
    <br>He says, 'Breakthrough!'
    <br>Your belief is your response.
    <br>I say, breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Believing is our connection; just believe - you shall be saved, says the Lord.
    <br>That belief is your response.
    <br>At this moment, out there, you can respond to anything and you don't really mean it.
    <br>You may shout 'hallelujah' outside there but you don't really mean it.
    <br>But at this moment in His presence, He is concerned about your response.
    <br>Whatever you say, so shall it be.
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I can hear from the Spirit of God.
    <br>He said to me, I should say to you, "Just believe".
    <br>He is not saying, "Believe!"; he says, "Just believe!"
    <br>There is a difference between 'just believe' and 'believe'.
    <br>He is begging you now.
    <br>He said, "Just believe" - so shall it be, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>If Jesus is saying, "Just believe", He is concerned about you.
    <br>He knows you, He knows your disposition.
    <br>He knows you are weak. He wants to be your strength.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Just believe".
    <br>Just believe!
    <br>Tell the viewers all over the world!
    <br>Just believe!
    <br>In this case now, no one will leave here without being delivered.
    <br>If Jesus could say, "Just believe!" - He is not saying, "Believe"; He says, "Just believe!"
    <br>He is begging you; He is telling you, "Look. Just believe!"
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>What is your response now? - Just believe!
    <br>Tell your neighbour!
    <br>Just believe!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, just believe!
    <br>Jesus said to you, "Just believe!"
    <br>Hallelujah!
