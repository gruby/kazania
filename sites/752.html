  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It is all about faith.
    <br>When we examine our daily life, we will find out how much faith we have.
    <br>When you examine your life, your daily life, you will be able to find out how much faith you have.
    <br>When somebody says, "I'm a Christian" I just laugh.
    <br>I am a Christian, I am a pastor, I am a bishop, I am this... but examine your daily life,
    <br>you will find out how much faith you have.
    <br>An empty profession of faith will not help us at all.
    <br>An empty one...
    <br>This is a life we live today, professional faith - empty.
    <br>I am a Christian, whereas you are not.
    <br>What can we show?
    <br>I am a Christian - this is an empty professional faith.
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily life.
    <br>This means, by faith...
    <br>Because we have no other life as a Christian – faith.
    <br>You only apply faith when you need healing – that kind of faith is the kind of Christian you are.
    <br>You apply faith when you are in need of something from God.
    <br>God, help me, I have faith.
    <br>Even to sit down, you need faith to sit down.
    <br>To stand up - by faith.
    <br>To say Amen - by faith.
    <br>To greet - by faith.
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily life.
    <br>Until you know how much you need God.
    <br>But you - you don't need God to sit down.
    <br>This is a big mistake.
    <br>You don't know how much you need God, and you claim you are a Christian.
    <br>How many of you actually sit in the name of Jesus, by the help of Jesus,
    <br>or, when you are standing up you say, thank you Jesus?
    <br>No, you don't need God for those things. You believe you can do them.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “until you begin to know how much you need God.”
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Do you know that you need God to dress up?
    <br>Even to make a make-up.
    <br>You need God to comb your hair.
    <br>How many of you know this?
    <br>Do you know that you even need God to greet?
    <br>"How are you sir?" - you need God to say that.
    <br>Look at me - I need God to turn around.
    <br>I just need God to pick something from the ground.
    <br>But how many of you know this?
    <br>And you are saying you are serving God.
    <br>You say that you are serving God.
    <br>Satan lashes at you in the area you believe you don’t need God.
    <br>That is where satan attacks you.
    <br>Satan always attacks you where you believe you don't need God.
    <br>When you want to sit down, satan attacks you because he knows you would not call God to help you to sit.
    <br>When God is not involved your strength is zero.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “satan attacks where we believe we don’t need God”.
    <br>"How are you?" - you believe you don't need God to say that.
    <br>Satan comes in.
    <br>He always monitors your life to study and know the area you do not involve God.
    <br>That is the area to which he will come and attack.
    <br>You want to pray... OK, I'm going to pray, wait for me...
    <br>While you are going you don't need God, until you get to where you want to pray,
    <br>but before that - satan strikes you.
    <br>Until you know how much you need God, then you serve God.
    <br>You don’t know how much you need God.
    <br>You think that you don't need God for small things and you need God for big things.
    <br>You need God when a doctor tells you, "go and write your will,
    <br>we can no longer treat you. Just eat and leave, but this case - nothing we can do."
    <br>Then you run to God.
    <br>But as long as the doctor tells you that they can handle your case - you don't need God.
    <br>You always come to God with a case where all hopes are lost.
    <br>Then you involve God.
    <br>You don't need God.
    <br>Until you know how much you need God, then you begin to live a wonderful life - a life of contentment.
    <br>Then you discover yourself – what God says you can do,
    <br>what God says you are and what God says you can achieve.
    <br>Do you know that you need God to look at me?
    <br>But you are looking at me without involving God.
    <br>My God, you are looking at me without involving God because you don't need God to look at me,
    <br>until you get blind.
    <br>When you get blind you say, "God, open my eyes to see this man".
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>See, you are looking at me. You don't involve God to see me,
    <br>because you believe you don't need God to see me.
    <br>But when you are blind you involve God to open your eyes to see me.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "until you know how much you need God".
    <br>Not mine not mine the choice
    <br>In things both great and small
    <br>Be Thou my Guide my Strength
    <br>My Wisdom my All
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Before your coming here today, your problems are above your strength.
    <br>You realize that you need to go to the Synagogue.
    <br>You were handling things yourself.
    <br>You thought that this thing could have been handled by you with no problem,
    <br>but it is above you, and you quickly have to run here.
    <br>You are welcome.
    <br>Until you know how much you need God.
    <br>I know how much I need God; that is why I pray all the time, 24/7.
    <br>I am always in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>Look at me, I'm calling God to help me to turn.
    <br>See, as I'm talking to you I'm talking to God to help me to turn.
    <br>I turn and I say "Thank you Jesus".
    <br>I need God to move my leg - "Oh God, thank you".
    <br>This is why I pray all the time.
    <br>Because you don’t know how much you need God, that is why you have a time, when and how to pray.
    <br>Big situations happen occasionally but little situations happen all the time.
    <br>Look at me, because I have not called God to be involved - I cannot move.
    <br>OK, now - "God, thank you - I am moving".
    <br>See, at the same time I am talking I pray "thank you for Your strength to talk".
    <br>I am turning again and I pray "thank you Lord, give me the strength to turn".
    <br>If I want to sleep I would do the same.
    <br>All the time - I pray all the time, because I need Him in all I do.
    <br>I know how much I need Him.
    <br>I need Him to be involved in everything I do.
    <br>Then - there is no time to break.
    <br>Your problem is you don't know how much you need God.
    <br>Those areas you believe you don’t need God are the areas the satan uses to enter.
    <br>That is avenue for satan, the route for satan – those areas you believe you don’t need God.
    <br>You create an avenue and opportunity for satan to enter you.
    <br>At the time you think you don't need God - satan has entered already.
    <br>He has used these small things you believed you could do yourself, whereas you don't have any strength.
    <br>Those things you believe you can do yourself, it is not you – you don't have strength to do anything.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "How much you need God".
    <br>You need to know how much you need God.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>You need to know how much you need God.
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>You need to know how much you need God.
    <br>Stand up now. Are you calling God to stand up? That is the problem.
    <br>Where did you get the strength to stand up? From God. But why are you not involving Him?
    <br>It means you are using your own strength to stand up.
    <br>I can see the reason why you have the spinal cord injury.
    <br>Let us stand up.
    <br>Sit down. Are you involving God?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>For the first time.
    <br>When you begin to recognize and to know that you need God even in the small things...
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily life.
    <br>If you want to overcome and become victorious in this word, you must know how much you need God.
    <br>Can you greet your colleague? Give a handshake to your colleague.
    <br>Are you involving God?
    <br>Can you do that yourself?
    <br>You are involving God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Smile. Are you involving God to smile?
    <br>Take this from me: it shall be well with you!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Satan is a very crafty person, trickish and tactical.
    <br>You have to involve God.
    <br>Those areas you fail to involve God are the areas satan is using.
    <br>You don't need to say, "I must pray before I sleep", if you have been praying already.
    <br>Sitting on the bed you have to involve God.
    <br>Laying and stretching your head on the the pillow you involve God.
    <br>When you lie down, you begin to meditate before you fall asleep.
    <br>You are praying before you stand up and go somewhere...
    <br>Then, there is no way for satan.
    <br>Those areas you find difficult to penetrate in your career, business, health or even marriage...
    <br>The One who watches over you never sleeps; why are you sleeping?
    <br>If you don't pray, you are sleeping.
    <br>He is watching over you 24/7.
    <br>You have to call Him 24/7; you have to involve Him 24/7.
    <br>As you are looking at me, are you involving God?
    <br>Something is going on in your heart, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Just, "Thank You, Jesus!" is enough.
    <br>It is just enough.
    <br>"Thank you Jesus" - as you are looking at me.
    <br>It means you are involving Him.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus", but I do not understand what this man is saying.
    <br>Please, give me an understanding.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" - just thank You, Jesus.
    <br>You want to sit down - "Thank You Jesus".
    <br>You stand up - "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You want to dance - "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You can start from there - "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>When He hears your thanks, He will open the relationship for you; He will give you a Word to say.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" - look at me, I am moving.
    <br>You cannot see my lips moving but I am saying something.
    <br>What I am saying is, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>But you will never see me because I am not involving my flesh, my body.
    <br>I never involve them to say that so therefore, it is possible for me to do other things on the outside.
    <br>It is when I involve my body to say "thank You, Jesus", and you are now calling me,
    <br>I would not be able to answer you.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" - if I want to answer you, I need to stop saying "thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Ehe - what are you saying?
    <br>It is because I am involving my flesh.
    <br>We are fighting spirit beings.
    <br>If our weapon of warfare were carnal, I would need to give you a gun and cutlass.
    <br>But our weapon of warfare is not carnal because we are fighting spirit beings.
    <br>Even when I am moving now - I am giving and I am receiving.
    <br>If I am only giving, and I am not receiving I would be dry
    <br>OK, see me.
    <br>I am giving you, but I must receive.
    <br>To receive, my heart must involve with God.
    <br>While I am giving, I receive.
    <br>I give, I am being filled.
    <br>You give but you do not receive.
    <br>Faith is a believer's heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Faith is a believer's heart.
    <br>Again.
    <br>Faith is a believer's heart.
    <br>It is a believer's heart - that is faith.
    <br>If someone asks you, "what is faith?" - you say, "faith is a believer's heart".
    <br>Someone say, "faith is to expect God to do what He is expected to do".
    <br>That is the definition.
    <br>It is simple - faith is a believer's heart.
    <br>And when you live by faith, walk by faith, talk by faith...
    <br>I can be going, you listen to me and I am talking to God.
    <br>If I want to talk to you I say "how are you?", but at the same time I am talking to God,
    <br>because my heart is faith.
    <br>If I want to talk to you, it does not mean I should stop talking to God;
    <br>I can be talking to God and at the same time, talking to you.
    <br>Yes, because it is my heart.
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>That is why you can have any form of face; oval face, round face, be tall, fat, yellow, red, green,
    <br>but in our hearts, we are like Jesus.
    <br>A believer's heart is faith.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>Once again.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus inner my heart
    <br>Christianity lies in our hearts.
    <br>Begin to think about yourself.
    <br>Many of us are worshipping a God we do not know.
    <br>You never heard from Him before;
    <br>He never talked with you or acted with you and you never acted with Him.
    <br>You talk and act with Him by imagination.
    <br>Don't forget, while you are sitting down to say, "Thank You, Jesus" in your heart.
    <br>And begin to "fire-on" as you are looking at me, because as I am looking at you, I am fire.
    <br>What I say is what I receive, but I should also receive as I am giving you.
    <br>So, to receive from Him as I give you, my Spirit-man should also continue to "fire-on".
    <br>Begin to talk, "thank You, Jesus. I need more to give them".
    <br>As I give you my Spirit-man receives from Jesus, so I would not be "empty".
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Are you depending on Jesus to sit? What are you saying? "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>He loves it when you recognise Him, when you know He is your Lord and put Him where He belongs.
    <br>He is not one of those things; He is the only.
    <br>You make your plan. At the end of the day you say, "OK, I want to go to the church,
    <br>and I have to come back by 12 and go to the meeting".
    <br>You are making Him one of those things.
    <br>He is the only.
    <br>When you make a plan for the only one, do not miss that plan.
    <br>He is not a tenant, He is the landlord.
    <br>The challenge we have today is our upbringing.
    <br>Upbringing is still there.
    <br>We have not disconnected from upbringing in terms of our spiritual life.
    <br>Upbringing.
    <br>You are not yet what God says you are; you are like someone.
    <br>You look like somebody; your achievement is like somebody.
    <br>You talk like somebody; your behaviour is like somebody.
    <br>Your achievement can be compared with somebody - this is how he behaves.
    <br>That is why they don't miss you when you are not around,
    <br>because there are many people around who can do what you are doing.
    <br>You should be unique.
    <br>You are sent to make a difference.
    <br>You are pursuing what others have pursued.
    <br>What others have achieved is what you want to achieve.
    <br>You are not unique in any way.
    <br>If there is any uniqueness in your life - let me know.
    <br>Maybe your hair - you have blond hair, or you look tall, you are beautiful, or you are very rich,
    <br>there is no one as rich as you are, or you are an eloquent speaker.
    <br>No, you are not unique in any way. You are just like others. And why?
    <br>This is why the world is stagnant.
    <br>There were no differences in the world for past many years.
    <br>Since I was born I cannot see any difference in the world - the world is still the same.
    <br>Scientists cannot have a breakthrough any more. There is a trouble in the world.
    <br>There is no difference in the economy, no breakthrough in economy, no breakthrough in science,
    <br>no breakthrough in any area.
    <br>When we don’t have breakthrough, we continue to go around the cycle of life.
    <br>What we have used is what we keep using.
    <br>The idea we applied in the past is the same idea we are still applying.
    <br>The same idea.
    <br>In these days we talk of ideas appearing in the last 50 years.
    <br>Where were discoveries in different areas of life, but there is nothing like this any more.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>When you go to the airport you learn that there is no aircraft any more.
    <br>The little aircraft we have all over the world are damaged.
    <br>There is no a new one.
    <br>The exploitation of the one they discovered 5 years ago was stopped,
    <br>because it caused crisis and accidents all around the world.
    <br>The solar energy that you are talking about seems to be not reliable.
    <br>It is not yet confirmed, that the world can rely on that.
    <br>There is a crisis in the world.
    <br>There are no more discoveries.
    <br>We keep using old ideas, recycling...
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>I will give you just a second or two minutes to think about your life.
    <br>Are you from Europe? Are you from Asia? Where are you from? Are you from Africa?
    <br>OK, sit down and think if there is any discovery in the world in your area.
    <br>We are running out of ideas.
    <br>The world is running out of ideas because we fail to carry God along.
    <br>We fail to know how much we need God.
    <br>You need to know how much you need God.
    <br>You need God to take a bath.
    <br>You need God to make up.
    <br>You need God to rub a cream.
    <br>You need God to look at the mirror.
    <br>The moment you know how much you need God, you are with God 24/7.
    <br>A break in God is a relationship with satan.
    <br>Just a break with God is a relationship with satan because there is no vacuum, no neutral world.
    <br>It is either you are dark or you are light.
    <br>When you are out of light, you are in darkness.
    <br>You may not confess satan but your faith is not practical.
    <br>Faith must be practical.
    <br>You must exercise your faith to show you believe because the belief in your heart is released by faith.
    <br>If I say I believe - to show I believe, my faith must be practised.
    <br>If I believe, where is my faith?
    <br>I believe Jesus Christ is my Lord and Saviour.
    <br>You believe Jesus is Saviour and your Lord. Where is your faith?
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>There is not abstract faith.
    <br>It must be practised.
    <br>If you have faith that is not practical, definitely, you have no faith.
    <br>"I believe" - where is your faith?
    <br>The belief in our heart can only be released by faith.
    <br>The question now: Are you a Christian?
    <br>Yes – it means you believe Jesus is your Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Yes – OK, show me your Saviour by faith.
