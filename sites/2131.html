    <br>At one of the live services at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua moves along the row
    <br>ministering prayer and prophecy, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Get ready to witness the power of prophecy expose the root cause of this woman's problem.
    <br>Your underwear went missing.
    <br>Since then your menstruation ceased and it is affecting your system.
    <br>Man of God, for the twelve years I have been married, there's no children.
    <br>Did you listen to what I am saying?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Your menstruation is not regular; it makes you a man.
    <br>You are not a woman.
    <br>Man of God, it is true.
    <br>You are not a woman unless you are delivered.
    <br>Your home is broken and this is not your first marriage.
    <br>Of course.
    <br>Yes, it is not the first marriage.
    <br>Look, I am just telling you. I don't know you people. I'm just telling you.
    <br>- Okay?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>And you, where you were coming from, you were disappointed.
    <br>Your people wanted to push you, but you said no.
    <br>Yes, Man of God; it is true.
    <br>A curse is following you.
    <br>Deliver me, Man of God.
    <br>You, the problem you have is that you looked at the first marriage
    <br>as someone whom you could not take out - that she did not fit you.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You are now looking for a first lady.
    <br>Your first lady is not your first wife.
    <br>Yes, that is it, Man of God.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>To God be the glory, she is free!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our names are Mr and Mrs Romanus Udeaku.
    <br>We are from Enugu State, Nigeria, but we live in Cameroon.
    <br>This is our testimony.
    <br>We had been barren for 16 years.
    <br>We came to The SCOAN in 2011.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave us a prophecy.
    <br>He said that my underwear was missing.
    <br>All that he said was exactly the truth.
    <br>He said that I was a man; that I was no longer a woman and that my menstruation was irregular.
    <br>Everything that he said was true.
    <br>For the past 16 years, I ran helter skelter
    <br>to native doctors, herbalists and many churches,
    <br>all to no avail until somebody directed us here.
    <br>How did you feel as a woman when you saw other people with their children celebrating? How did that make you feel?
    <br>I felt bad.
    <br>As you looked at me, I would laugh outside but inside I was crying.
    <br>Last December was the first time in 16 years that I went home with a baby.
    <br>YOU ARE NOT A WOMAN UNLESS YOU ARE DELIVERED!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>I received the prophecy and we went back to Cameroon.
    <br>After two weeks, I noticed that I was pregnant with this baby.
    <br>This is the picture of when I was pregnant.
    <br>Everybody was congratulating me, asking how it happened.
    <br>I told them that I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I was very happy when I was pregnant.
    <br>Now, I am a woman.
    <br>When other women are talking, I can talk along with them.
    <br>For the past 16 years, whenever I was among women
    <br>who were talking about when they were pregnant,
    <br>I could never join them because I had never experienced it.
    <br>But now, I thank God, I am a woman.
    <br>I can talk.
    <br>Whenever other women are talking, I can talk along with them.
    <br>- Praise the Lord!
    <br>- Hallelujah. Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>The name of my baby is Chizaramekpere Precious.
    <br>Because it was such a long time before we came here
    <br>we met a nursing sister who told us about adoption.
    <br>After we came here, my husband told her to wait for some months
    <br>and if we did not see results, we would go for the adoption.
    <br>- After just two weeks you saw the results?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>YOU ARE NOT A WOMAN UNLESS YOU ARE DELIVERED!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>Our names are Mr and Mrs Romanus Udeaku.
    <br>We are from Enugu State, Nigeria, but we reside in Cameroon.
    <br>My wife has said it all, but I want to add something.
    <br>I am very happy!
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave us was very true
    <br>because this is not my first wife.
    <br>I am now 53 years old and this is my first child.
    <br>It was not easy.
    <br>So, I thank God that after a long time I now have a baby.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>I want to advise the viewers and my fellow women who are watching me now:
    <br>With God all things are possible.
    <br>God is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Amen.
