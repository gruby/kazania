  <p>    
    <br>For a while, some years now, I have been very calm.
    <br>Many things that happened around the world, I saw it.
    <br>But I said, when I say a little thing, you twist it.
    <br>The world cannot be in the dark.
    <br>This is one of the reasons I am here today.
    <br>Let me start from where we are now, Nigeria, our country.
    <br>I was in a vision three weeks ago.
    <br>I have been praying.
    <br>In that vision, the Lord said to me particularly, "Pray for your president" -
    <br>that is the voice of God.
    <br>Our President, Muhammadu Buhari, I have been praying for him.
    <br>The instruction from God - is above.
    <br>"Pray for protection - for God to protect him
    <br>and fill him with wisdom enough to lead this country, the nation Nigeria".
    <br>I have been doing that.
    <br>And the Lord said to me, "He is a human being. There is no perfect man on earth".
    <br>Nigeria - I am talking to you. Take this word - that is the voice of God.
    <br>There is no perfect man on earth.
    <br>If you are looking for a perfect man, you need to go to Heaven.

    <br>And I still keep to myself, offering this prayer for the nation and for the president -
    <br>to fill him and protect him with wisdom enough to lead the nation.
    <br>I travelled three days ago outside Lagos for that prayer as well.

    <br>In my vision I saw the Seraphim.
    <br>The word 'Seraphim' - I know when you leave from here, you will look at the meaning.
    <br>I saw the Seraphim come down with rain.
    <br>You know when it is raining - sometimes in the rain, you see stones coming down
    <br>but this time, Seraphim came down with rain.
    <br>This rain - with freshness and calmness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The rain comes with freshness and calmness.
    <br>When the rain was falling - with freshness and calmness.
    <br>Please let us pray for our government, Muhammadu Buhari;
    <br>pray for them.
    <br>Take your time and pray for them.
    <br>Nigeria, let us pray.
    <br>So now, for you to be lamenting, complaining, I think you will stop this now and pray.
    <br>So, Nigeria, lamenting, complaining and all that, I think that should be stopped
    <br>and resort to prayer.
    <br>And pray for your president; he is a human being.
    <br>No man is perfect on earth.
    <br>Look at the rain.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much.
