    <br>There is a man under the gallery somewhere there.
    <br>You ordered a talisman from a foreign country - a ring, handkerchief.
    <br>They came to you.
    <br>You used them for several things and later it disappeared.
    <br>Well, I don't know - you have seen the repercussions of it.
    <br>So come.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>He is there.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>My name is Former Doctor Buh Ignatius from Cameroon.
    <br>I am the one to confirm the prophesy of the man of God
    <br>that there is a man who commanded the ring two years ago and the ring disappeared.
    <br>So the repercussion is now on his children and his life.
    <br>My children are here.
    <br>This is the talisman.
    <br>This is a completion of the book to confirm what the man of God said.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Good morning, church.
    <br>My name is spiritual doctor Buh Ignatius from Cameroon.
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my wife.
    <br>I am here to confirm the prophesy of the man of God last Sunday.
    <br>He said, "There is a man under the gallery," 
    <br>- he pointed directly to me -
    <br>"who commanded a ring from overseas, and a handkerchief and a book".
    <br>"And now there is repercussions. He should come out, his life is in danger".
    <br>I never wanted to come out.
    <br>I don't know what brought me out,
    <br>until I found myself in front of the altar.
    <br>The prophecy of the man of God was 100% true.
    <br>I have the book here with me.
    <br>All this started some 28 years ago.
    <br>I was not fortunate to be born in a Christian home.
    <br>My grandfather was a high priest in my village,
    <br>while my father was an occultist.
    <br>So, I grew up from that background.
    <br>At the age of 14,
    <br>I was in secondary school and I experienced a strange ailment.
    <br>They were running helter-skelter for my treatment,
    <br>but to no avail.
    <br>So, three months after contracting the sickness, my grandfather ordered my father to bring me to the village.
    <br>I went to the village for treatment.
    <br>So, I was there. I stayed there for some months.
    <br>During the course of the treatment my grandfather died.
    <br>Two weeks after the burial, some certain old people came.
    <br>The youngest of them was at least 75 years old.
    <br>They said that my grandfather had left a will
    <br>and that I am the one to inherit from him.
    <br>At that age of 14 years, I had no other option than to accept.
    <br>I tried to talk to my father and mother to ask whether this was true.
    <br>They said that it was true, and that they had prepared for this.
    <br>So from that moment, I had no option.
    <br>My father came, because my father was based in Boya by that time.
    <br>My village is some 500 km from Boya.
    <br>I was there with my grandfather in the north west region, while my father was working in the south west region.
    <br>They called for him and he came with my mother.
    <br>They brought a goat and seven traditional chickens.
    <br>I was carried behind the house.
    <br>The goat was slaughtered and I drank the blood,
    <br>and I was bathed in the river at midnight with the goat.
    <br>They killed the chickens and they gave me the seven hearts of the chickens to swallow.
    <br>The moment that I swallowed, things were never the same in my life again.
    <br>I was different.
    <br>I became very violent.
    <br>From that moment, a serious spirit of lust came to me.
    <br>As I started practicing, the first three months I had only four wives that I married officially.
    <br>In the first year I had seven wives.
    <br>I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>You started practicing as a witch doctor from the age of ... ?
    <br>From the day of my initiation.
    <br>They said that I had no time to waste because my grandfather had left a lot of incomplete jobs.
    <br>So how old were you then when you started practicing?
    <br>I was 14 years of age.
    <br>The initiation process took 4 years.
    <br>But during those 4 years I was practicing while being initiated, because there was no other person.
    <br>I was the only one by that time.
    <br>At the age of 18, I was already a full time witch doctor.
    <br>People were coming from all over to see me, because I am not only known in Cameroon, but all over the world.
    <br>They were coming to see me.
    <br>But one fateful day, a general came and met me in the village.
    <br>He said that my talent does not warrant me to be in the village
    <br>and that he wanted to take me away from the village.
    <br>I consulted the old people.
    <br>They said that they are already old and that I should go out and look for food for them.
    <br>So, they allowed me to go to capital city in Yaounde.
    <br>The general rented a four bedroom flat and paid for me to stay there.
    <br>I was working for him.
    <br>He was bringing other patients to me.
    <br>That is where I established myself in Yaounde, becoming known in Yaounde.
    <br>From that time, things were going very well because people were coming from all over to see me.
    <br>Goods were there - fowls, cows, everything.
    <br>People would be healed, but tomorrow there would be a problem.
    <br>They would come back and I would give them another alternative: "Try to bring this the next day". Just like that.
    <br>By that time I had a variety of clients,
    <br>but my principal clients were prostitutes, armed robbers and fraudsters who came to seek my help.
    <br>As I said, I was a chief priest.
    <br>I usually gave them charms to destroy the minds of people, to confuse people.
    <br>For example, a fraudster would come to me and say, "I have a client at United Arab Emirates".
    <br>"I spoke to him two years ago. We had a project for two billion."
    <br>I would ask him, "Give me the name. I will work on it".
    <br>The man would accept everything and my percentage would come.
    <br>That is how I practiced.
    <br>They would even take me out of the country to practice.
    <br>So I have been practicing all over the world with fraudsters.
    <br>An armed robber would come wanting a charm to protect him from gun shots - above human destruction.
    <br>I would prepare a charm for him.
    <br>He would go, they would shoot him, but the bullet would not enter his body.
    <br>And at times, we would disappear.
    <br>At times, they would bring a robe from a dead corpse.
    <br>I would work on that robe. They would put the robe in someone's compound.
    <br>They would sleep with their family and operate without any incident.
    <br>That is how I had been practicing.
    <br>Those were my three main customers for more than 28 years.
    <br>A woman would come to me and say, "I want a man."
    <br>I would ask for the name of the man, and at times he would already be a married man.
    <br>I had no option - I was there to do my job.
    <br>So, I would destroy that marriage first, before implanting them as husband and wife.
    <br>That is how I usually practiced.
    <br>It was so common for me to do.
    <br>At that time, I had been practicing for 11 years as a serious witch doctor in my country.
    <br>Unfortunately for me, my father who was supporting me spiritually, fell sick and he died.
    <br>He left a will to say that that I should bury him 17 kilometers from my village.
    <br>I asked him why and he said that he was trying to protect my brothers and I.
    <br>I said, "It is very difficult. You know that you will not be there. I will not fight those people."
    <br>He said that he would be with me.
    <br>So, I started the project, until I buried my father 17 km from the village as he requested. 
    <br>Returning now to my initiators - they never wanted to see me because my father owed them spiritual debts.
    <br>They wanted my father to be buried there so that they could use his corpse for certain things. He knew this.
    <br>He died, so I was a target now.
    <br>They started following me.
    <br>I was banned from being in their presence, so I was stranded.
    <br>In the midst of that confusion,
    <br>one of my friends from West Africa who is based in Ghana, attended the funeral of my father.
    <br>He came to Cameroon and said that we should talk after the funeral. 
    <br>We left from the village to Boya and spoke. He said that he would help me.
    <br>I was desperate because nobody was coming again - by that time everything was going wrong.
    <br>I could not sleep.
    <br>I could not rest.
    <br>I could not meet with my wife as husband and wife.
    <br>While going out I would do things with other women, but there was nothing with my wife.
    <br>The relations with the seven women were meaningless - only physical - having kids left and right.
    <br>Everything was going wrong.
    <br>How did you manage to get these women?
    <br>Those women were clients who would come to me - when they were beautiful they would not leave.
    <br>Like this woman next to me, she is one of the victims.
    <br>They came for a consultation with me, just as this woman came to me with a leg problem - an ulcer.
    <br>By the power of darkness, I treated her.
    <br>I said, "No, you will not go."
    <br>It just started as a joke. That was all.
    <br>She has been with me for fourteen years.
    <br>The ogugu power took them as slaves; the spirit took them as slaves for me.
    <br>She is a victim - the principal victim - because...
    <br>Now tell us, you said that you met a friend who promised to help you. What happened?
    <br>As I met that friend, after the funeral of my father, we came to Boya.
    <br>That is where the prophecy of the man of God came in.
    <br>By that time, he said I should give my underwear to him to travel with.
    <br>I took my underwear and gave it to him.
    <br>He left for Ghana.
    <br>But he had a contact with a particular high priest in China.
    <br>He told me that he will not allow me to meet the high priest personally,
    <br>because the conditions were too heavy and I was depressed; I would not be able bear  it.
    <br>He said that he would work as a middle man for me.
    <br>So he took my underwear and went.
    <br>Two weeks later I received a call to say that I should go to a T- junction where I discovered this book and a ring. 
    <br>At midnight I took this book and a ring and went with it.
    <br>At 2 am a person appeared to me and gave me instructions that I should open the book on page 24.
    <br>I would find a brochure, which I should read to get instructions.
    <br>So I read everything.
    <br>It said that I should look for a plate and a knife, and a live dove.
    <br>I caught the dove, drank the blood and swallowed the heart.
    <br>Immediately a serious spirit of divination came to me - I was above human destruction.
    <br>So as I went there, I found this book and a red coloured ring. 
    <br>At 2 am somebody appeared to me and gave me instructions that I should open the book on page 24
    <br>- I would see a small paper, a brochure, which I should read.
    <br>So, I went through the instructions.
    <br>They said that I should buy a new plate and a knife, and a live dove.
    <br>To find and capture the dove was not easy.
    <br>The next day they directed me again to go where I took this book
    <br>and I found the dove waiting for me. So I took the dove.
    <br>I did not complain outwardly, but within me I was complaining.
    <br>They answered me, because they knew my heart - because I was already engaged with them.
    <br>I went and collected the dove, and slaughtered it.
    <br>I drank the blood of the dove and I swallowed the heart.
    <br>Immediately a serious spirit of divination came to me.
    <br>I discovered that I am above human destruction.
    <br>By that time I was not myself again.
    <br>I was a witch doctor in the past, but now I was a spiritual leader. It was just for treatment and to do atrocities. 
    <br>God doesn't do things like that, now that I am in the Arena of Liberty.
    <br>I am really regretting what I did, but in the past I was completely happy.
    <br>So I started doing things, performing miracles in my country, going abroad  to do miracles.
    <br>Women and prostitutes were coming to see me.
    <br>I bounced back to form because I was already weak when my initiator abandoned me.
    <br>Now as I received these powers, I became very strong and powerful, so that I did not need their help again.
    <br>I was independent, relying only on my friend, giving him details about my performance.
    <br>For example, my principal customers were prostitutes,
    <br>because in them the condition they gave me, was that I will not sacrifice
    <br>because my friend was already sacrificing human blood.
    <br>So for me, I would not sacrifice.
    <br>But virtues of people - I mean the manliness of people -
    <br>would be taken from the prostitutes to the kingdom for more power.
    <br>So, prostitutes would act as a principal source of my spiritual revenue.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Any person who patronised them was a victim for me.
    <br>Immediately when they slept with the prostitutes, they were initiated into the kingdom.
    <br>After I met a woman like that
    <br>two weeks, three weeks, a month, two months later their activities would never be the same again.
    <br>They would start accusing people without knowing where their problems come from;
    <br>without knowing that we were the cause.
    <br>So, if they were a businessman, they would never do business again.
    <br>If they were a civil servant, there would be numerous problems on their job site.
    <br>Those are the things that usually happened to those people.
    <br>I did this.
    <br>At times I usually had around twenty thousand Dollars in my hand, but the next day I would not have a Franc.
    <br>All those women, even to feed them, was a problem.
    <br>There was money entering every day, but I did not know where the money was going.
    <br>At this time, as I am talking now before the children of God, I do not have anywhere to go.
    <br>My children are not going to school.
    <br>I don't have a place to live.
    <br>All projects I started have stopped.
    <br>This proves that I was really in the world.
    <br>If I, the master, could suffer like this they would have triple suffering in their area.
    <br>So, I feel sorry for them but at that time, I had no other option.
    <br>This woman beside me did something - we are in the presence of God.
    <br>I went one day for an operation in one neighbouring village in Yaounde.
    <br>It was a serious operation with a dignitary.
    <br>I returned and found that she had installed a certain television in my house called Emmanuel TV.
    <br>As I entered the house, the whole house was not the same.
    <br>I asked her: "What happened?"
    <br>She said a cable man came into the house and installed a television.
    <br>She had been watching; it was very interesting.
    <br>She was talking to me happily, without knowing that I was already disturbed.
    <br>I held my temper because there were people.
    <br>After they left, I beat her seriously and I warned her never to put that television on again,
    <br>because from that time - that very day - I started having problems with my sleep.
    <br>Those people started warning me that if I do not send this woman out, my life is in danger. So I threw her out.
    <br>As I threw her out, as she was already in a covenant with me, she could not be out.
    <br>She would come in again. I would still send her out, but she would come in
    <br>because there was no way she could resist what we did in the beginning.
    <br>Do you mean that since the day your wife installed Emmanuel TV in your house there has been no peace?
    <br>That means you have been troubled because of your evil practices?
    <br>I have never got peace, until that day that I went to my shrine.
    <br>I found that my ring was not there anymore - the ring had disappeared without my knowledge.
    <br>I looked for the ring. The next day I had the call.
    <br>Mr Buh Ignatius - Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>At this point in time, for the benefit of those who are just joining us, viewers all over the world,
    <br>this confession you are listening to was born out of a prophecy
    <br>given by the anointed man of God last Sunday Service
    <br>to this man about a talisman he received from a foreign country and a ring.
    <br>The ring which he refers to right now as having disappeared
    <br>after the Emmanuel TV was installed in his house.
    <br>Can we refresh our memory again and for those who are just joining us to see what the prophecy spoke about,
    <br>what the man is talking about right now.
    <br>Let's watch the screen again and see this prophecy.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>There is a man under the gallery somewhere there.
    <br>You ordered a talisman from a foreign country - ring, handkerchief.
    <br>They came to you.
    <br>You used it for several things and later it disappeared.
    <br>Well, I don't know - you have seen the repercussions of it.
    <br>So come.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>He is there.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>My name is former Doctor Buh Ignatius from Cameroon.
    <br>I am the one to confirm the prophecy of the man of God,
    <br>that there is a man who commanded the ring two years ago and the ring disappeared.
    <br>So the repercussion is now on his children and his life.
    <br>My children are here.
    <br>This is a talisman. This is a completion of the book to confirm what the man of God said.
    <br>Ok, so tell us eventually how did you find yourself at The SCOAN last week before this prophecy came.
    <br>It was not easy.
    <br>The prophecy came.
    <br>I stood there for over five minutes thinking back how many patients count on me,
    <br>because my coming here was just for deliverance, to have rest
    <br>and to tap from the anointing of the man of God to continue my job.
    <br>That was my aim coming here.
    <br>So you mean your coming here last Sunday was to come and seek for breakthrough, for success
    <br>and to add more powers to the power you already had to practice your occultic and witch doctor practices.
    <br>But you didn't know that the power here was the power from Above.
    <br>That is true.
    <br>Brethren, children of God, my coming here was to have more power.
    <br>Because in the kingdom we know this man - the man at The Synagogue. We know him.
    <br>Because in the whole world, he is the only Prophet that talks love, peace and forgiveness and faith.
    <br>Others talk of money.
    <br>"My Wife Is One Of My Victims!!!" | CHILLING WITCHDOCTOR EXPOSÉ
    <br>And those are things that we forbid in the kingdom -
    <br>we don't want to hear love, unity, faith and reconciliation.
    <br>He is the only Prophet.
    <br>If you hear most of his sermons, he never talks of wealth, prosperity - only faith, forgiveness.
    <br>He is the most hated Prophet in the kingdom.
    <br>So, we know that there is anointing on him.
    <br>I came here to tap a bit to go now and perform more.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>In those days, despite you knowing that the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua, is a prophet of God,
    <br>and his anointing is from Above, you never realized what the Bible says
    <br>that light and darkness have nothing in common?
    <br>I never realized, because I have gone to so many other places that this woman took me to.
    <br>As I entered there, the next day we would be friends with the pastor - we ate and dined together.
    <br>They came even for prophecy and gave me names to prophecy for them.
    <br>So I thought that this....
    <br>But when you came here, you were arrested.
    <br>I found a different story. I was exposed.
    <br>- You say?.. 
    <br>- I found a different story.
    <br>I was exposed because I wanted just my deliverance to be able to rest, to sleep,
    <br>to have peace with my family and return now performing.
    <br>And you were exposed instead.
    <br>Exposed!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Truly, this the first time.
    <br>I have been to places with this woman next to me, as I said,
    <br>carrying me everywhere.
    <br>At times, I was going there to please her.
    <br>When I went there, I was delivered and they said, "It's over".
    <br>The next day I would have sexual intercourse with twenty to thirty women per night.
    <br>The next day after they said, "You are delivered".
    <br>The next day the pastor would call me and say, "I want to see you privately."
    <br>He would give some names to prophecy.
    <br>I would prophecy and write it on a paper.
    <br>When the people came, he would make the prophecy as if he was the one doing so.
    <br>I knew it was the style of life - we were together.
    <br>Ok, so since last Sunday after the man of God gave the prophecy you came out,
    <br>and you confirmed it and you were delivered.
    <br>Can you tell us what are the evidences of this deliverance in your life?
    <br>Since last week, for many years until today I was suffering from this repercussion,
    <br>as the man of God said,
    <br>this is the first week that I have truly slept.
    <br>My children are resting because they didn't  even sleep in the house.
    <br>They were always out sleeping on top of roofs. My wife, nobody could sleep. We didn't have any rest.
    <br>So, it is the first time in my life for a long period that I sleep like a baby and get up.
    <br>The woman that was in contact with me has not called me since Sunday last week.
    <br>She had a proposal for me to come in Cameroon in April for recruitment for youths.
    <br>So she never called me since Sunday until today.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>And that anger that you used to have?
    <br>That anger is gone. I am now like a baby.
    <br>And that spirit of lust, that I cannot be a day without having sexual intercourse - I don't feel it.
    <br>And I am now a father, talking to my children, conversing with my wife, making projects.
    <br>Even without any future, I know there is a God that will take me through.
    <br>Once again let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for the wonderful deliverance you have received.
    <br>The Bible says that when Jesus Christ enters our lives,
    <br>He puts an end to our past and gives birth to our future.
    <br>Now your past is over.
    <br>Old things pass away; all things become new.
    <br>We give glory to God for your life.
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God with us Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! 
    <br>My name is Marie Chantal.
    <br>I come from Cameroon.
    <br>I am here today because of the prophecy the man of God gave to my husband.
    <br>I am francophone. I can't speak English well, but I can manage it.
    <br>I met this man through my friend.
    <br>I had been having leg pain and I had been looking for a witch doctor - some person to treat my leg.
    <br>My friend introduced me to him.
    <br>Previously I was with a rich man who was supposed to marry me,
    <br>but I don't know what happened, as I did not want to see the rich man again.
    <br>I only liked him. I rejected the rich man. I wanted only him.
    <br>He had three wives, and I was number four.
    <br>People of God, I was suffering a lot because the man beside me, a witch doctor, had a very violent spirit.
    <br>He was beating me,
    <br>he would burn me with an iron,
    <br>he would hit me with a stick,
    <br>he would do anything, but you could not say anything to him.
    <br>If he brought a woman in front of you, you could not say anything.
    <br>If he was seeing a woman behind you, you could not say anything.
    <br>If you opened your mouth, he would beat you seriously and you could not do anything to him.
    <br>If he beat me today and I left the house,
    <br>my heart would be beating very fast, so that if I did not go back to him, I would die.
    <br>So you mean, even with the beating that you used to receive from this man,
    <br>you could not stay outside the home for one day without coming back to the house.
    <br>Why is it that you always found yourself coming back to the house?
    <br>Because you are inside the charm and the charm controls you.
    <br>After that I had one boy with him. For thirteen to fourteen years, I only gave birth to one child.  
    <br>I never fell pregnant again.
    <br>Other ladies had children with him and they would bring his children at the age of two or three.
    <br>He would just give the child to me to look after.
    <br>He brought another baby of 9 months and I would have to look after the child. 
    <br>I could not argue.
    <br>I just took the child.
    <br>I could not refuse, because if I did he would beat me until ...
    <br>With all the beating you could not go?
    <br>Yes, I could not run.
    <br>As I went out , the next day I would come back inside my house.
    <br>Ok, your husband said he used to have different people coming to consult him.
    <br>He would do charms for them - like many prostitutes, armed robbers.
    <br>So those prostitutes that used to come visit him, what did he used to do with them?
    <br>The moment I came to the house, we started making medicine for them.
    <br>I was seeing women and men standing in a big line with fowls, goats and ducks.
    <br>They were cutting the animals and putting their blood inside the water.
    <br>They would mix perfume with it and bathe the people in it.
    <br>After that I would give them a charm to go stealing, doing ..., one wanted to travel -
    <br>we were making all the charms for the people,
    <br>Then after that, the moment that we came back to the house he would love me.
    <br>But when the spirit came, he would start beating me without any reason.
    <br>If I did any small thing that he did not approve of, he would beat me.
    <br>He would sleep with prostitutes next to me. 
    <br>He did not have any remorse. 
    <br>He would not do anything to please me or beg me.
    <br>He would only do what his heart told him to do. That is all.
    <br>"My Wife Is One Of My Victims!!!" | CHILLING WITCHDOCTOR EXPOSÉ
    <br>You mean all this while when your husband received these different women,
    <br>he would carry them to your matrimonial bed in your presence, and you could not say anything?
    <br>It is true.
    <br>If you challenged him, he would beat you.
    <br>He would beat me. I could not challenge him. I could not say anything to him. He would beat me.
    <br>He would do what he wanted to do. That is it.
    <br>And after I delivered my child, I could not have sexual relations with him again,
    <br>because if he wanted to come to me, his skin would be weak.
    <br>But in the night I was seeing him physically making love with me.
    <br>In the dream?
    <br>In the dream.
    <br>In the dream.
    <br>He could meet you in the dream as a husband, but physically he could not again.
    <br>He could not , yes.
    <br>He would become weak whenever he came to you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>After that I started seeing a child sucking my breast, having sexual relationship with him in the dream.
    <br>Since your husband's deliverance last Sunday, can you tell us what are the changes you have seen in him.
    <br>After last Sunday, the man of God prophesied to my husband, I said, "Oh!".
    <br>Because I knew that all these things we were passing through, I knew that there is a God.
    <br>I knew that the God who saved me would take me through.
    <br>And last Sunday, I saw the man of God prophesying to him.
    <br>I said, "Hallelujah!".
    <br>I knew my suffering had come to an end.
    <br>Tell us what are the things that have changed in the life of your husband
    <br>since after the prophecy and deliverance last Sunday.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>What are the things you noticed now -  those things he used to do before?
    <br>Tell us, what of now after his deliverance?
    <br>Since that deliverance on Sunday my husband behaves normal.
    <br>He cannot answer a call suspiciously. He is sitting in the house. There is no more shouting.
    <br>He is quiet. He cannot go out. He is no longer looking up and down for women. He is quiet now.
    <br>He is very quiet now in the house since the man of God prophesied to him on Sunday.
    <br>He is very quiet. I feel at peace now. I look at myself and say that I am a human being now.
    <br>Because before he would look at me and ask me, "What are you doing here?",
    <br>and he would beat me every day and do anything he wanted to do.
    <br>"You are not going? What are you doing here? I want different women".
    <br>"I don't want to see you again in this house. What are you doing here?".
    <br>I was not doing anything, because I knew that I could not go. He knew where he put me in.
    <br>I didn't know anything. But now I am a woman.
    <br>You are a woman now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You too are delivered now.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>The first time you installed Emmanuel TV in your house,
    <br>you say that your husband came, he saw it and he beat you.
    <br>Yes. The day that I discovered Emmanuel TV, this man wanted to kill me that day.
    <br>But through Emmanuel TV now, God delivered him.
    <br>Yes. And through Emmanuel TV now he has the deliverance.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let us clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So now your eyes are opened, unlike before when you didn't know where you were,
    <br>you didn't know you were in a cage as a result of the charm your husband had charmed you
    <br>when you met him as a witch doctor.
    <br>Now your husband is delivered; you are delivered.
    <br>How do you see him now?
    <br>I am very happy to see him because I know that his behavior was not normal.
    <br>Now I have fallen in love with him again.
    <br>I see my husband as my husband now.
    <br>"My Wife Is One Of My Victims!!!" | CHILLING WITCHDOCTOR EXPOSÉ
    <br>I know that before he was not my husband because that first time I was married to juju.
    <br>Because he was not behaving like a man, a human being.
    <br>But now he has changed.
    <br>This is my husband now.
    <br>With what you have passed through, your experience, your level  in the occultic world
    <br>and now you are delivered, looking back at where you are coming from -
    <br>what advice do you have for people who are listening to your testimony now
    <br>and for those who are still engaged in that occultic practice out there?
    <br>What word of advice do you have for them?
    <br>My advice will go first to parents.
    <br>I was not fortunate to grow up in a Christian home.
    <br>Any parent, because of his selfish ambitions and selfish projects, should not include their children into it.
    <br>Because my father forced me into this thing without my knowledge.
    <br>That is the first, for parents.
    <br>Secondly, for my colleagues all over the world, they are watching me now. I know.
    <br>Because if the head has fallen, it means that everybody must succumb.
    <br>It is time that we must put our arms down to focus, to know the truth, for the truth to set us free.
    <br>The truth has been hidden for so long but this is the day that I, Buh Ignatius,
    <br>am standing before the whole world talking that I am tired. I have tried the other side.
    <br>For a week now, I have tried this side, I have tested it - it's reliable.
    <br>So they should change.
    <br>God is reliable.
