    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>During a Live Sunday Service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied concerning an event
    <br>that would strike the nation of Italy
    <br>and cause headlines.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>I want every one of us
    <br>to pray for this country, Italy.
    <br>I don't know what happened there.
    <br>This is Italy.
    <br>I don't know, but open your lips
    <br>and pray for God's protection
    <br>in that country.
    <br>Something happened there
    <br>that caused headlines.
