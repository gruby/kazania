  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>I want to believe you have settled your account.
    <br>The principle in The SCOAN is what we believe in the Bible.
    <br>If you have not settled your account let us settle it now, it's not too late.
    <br>How many of you are still holding grudges, holding offence?
    <br>Whether right or wrong, you have no right to hold offence.
    <br>One thing we must know: an offence opens the door to satan.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Offence opens the door to satan.]
    <br>Satan is looking for a way of getting you.
    <br>We Christians believe that, ... "I have stopped smoking, lying, going to night-clubs. Now I live a righteous life."
    <br>But you are still claiming your right, when someone accused you - you hold an offence against that person.
    <br>An offence opens the door to satan.
    <br>You keep saying, "What is the cause of my problem? I have not been smoking, and doing other things.
    <br>I have been living a righteous life. Why this setback? Why this trouble? Why nightmare? Why sickness?"
    <br>An offence opens the door to demons.
    <br>You know what satan brings when he comes to your life;
    <br>he brings affliction, depression, poverty, hardship, crisis, all what you are facing now - the situation you are in.
    <br>An offence opens the door to satan.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[An offence opens the door to satan.]
    <br>Again.
    <br>[An offence opens the door to satan.]
    <br>When you hold offence, whether you are right or wrong;
    <br>when you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit
    <br>because you are not allowed to hold an offence, whether you are wrong or right.
    <br>You know, we Christians are always right - that is our principle.
    <br>We are right while others are wrong.
    <br>You lie against me, and you hold an offence against him; you are grieving the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Then, you allow satan.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are; whatever position you are in – listen to me.
    <br>An offence opens the door to satan and you know what satan brings when he comes -
    <br>disease, situation, depression – just name all those foolish  things
    <br>that is the work of satan; he is synonymous with these.
    <br>When you talk of sickness, satan is synonymous – he gives birth to them.
    <br>An offence opens the door.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence.
    <br>When you hold a grudge against a brother, you have already grieved God Himself.
    <br>You have to be free; when your spirit is free, it can contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>A free spirit contacts the Spirit of God – is sensitive to the Spirit of God.
    <br>It is time now, before we begin to pray, it is time for you and me...
    <br>This is why I'm asking you, "Have you settled your account?"
    <br>This is what the Bible means by forgive me as I have forgiven those who what?
    <br>Forgive me as I have what?
    <br>This is what the Bible is talking about.
    <br>Forgive me as I have forgiven those who sin against me.
    <br>Have you?
    <br>You have to forgive; if you forgive, you hold no offence – you let offence go.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to "fire-on".
    <br>Remember, you need restitution.
    <br>When you leave here just make a call.
    <br>A phone call can settle many of your cases.
    <br>Right now, prayer.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace.
    <br>Give me enablement Lord, to forgive those who have wronged me.
    <br>Lord Jesus, give me enablement.
    <br>Real love forgets wrongs so that there will be hope for the future.
    <br>The reason why you have to forget and love is that a servant today can be a leader tomorrow.
    <br>Someone you call a murderer today, your enemy today, can be your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>Your greatest enemy can be your saviour tomorrow or the saviour of your children.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tomorrow is a mystery.
    <br>Since tomorrow is a mystery, we don't know what will happen next,
    <br>we have to be very careful today so that we will not annoy, offend tomorrow.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Tomorrow is a mystery."
    <br>[Tomorrow is a mystery.]
    <br>Since I don’t know what will happen tomorrow,
    <br>[Since I don’t know what will happen tomorrow,]
    <br>I don’t want to offend tomorrow.
    <br>[I don’t want to offend tomorrow.]
    <br>You can offend tomorrow by today.
    <br>What you are doing today can offend tomorrow; what you are doing today can give favour tomorrow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, you cannot just explain tomorrow because God is tomorrow and the future.
    <br>Since you don’t know tomorrow, today you have to be very careful.
    <br>Be very very careful.
    <br>God does as He wills.
    <br>He can take what is unlikely to the palace and undeserved one would be there.
    <br>He does as He wills.
    <br>Let us be very very careful.
    <br>This is why you shouldn't judge your children by their character now.
    <br>The worst of your children can be the king tomorrow, the saviour of the family tomorrow.
    <br>Don't judge them be their attitude or character; continue to press on to changed them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to speak to every challenge.
    <br>We know satan is behind your challenges.
    <br>Satan is the cause of challenges.
    <br>Satan is responsible for whatever challenges you have because satan is synonymous with challenges.
    <br>I speak to every challenge in your life and I command them to leave, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You demon, I speak to you wherever you are in their lives -
    <br>be it their career,
    <br>be it their destiny,
    <br>be it their finances,
    <br>be it their business – out, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I speak to you demon, I command you to leave them, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Demon, leave me, in the name of Jesus."
    <br>Remember, every knee shall bow.
    <br>"Knees" means, demons must bow.
    <br>Every tongue shall confess Jesus.
    <br>Demons must listen to the voice of God.
    <br>I say to you, you demon – out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>You satan – out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Command them out, in Jesus' name.
