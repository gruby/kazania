    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us open the Book of Matthew 19:19.
    <br>Just a few texts there.
    <br>Hallelujah! Are you there?
    <br>Matthew 19:19
    <br>" 'Honour your father and mother and love your neighbour as yourself.' "
    <br>When you get home, just read the Book of Matthew 19 and take it from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>How can we love God without loving our neighbour?
    <br>It's not possible.
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your neighbour.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your neighbour.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your neighbour.
    <br>Again.
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your neighbour.
    <br>It's not possible.
    <br>Today I am so surprised when I see the religious people, the faith people -
    <br>they claim to love God without loving their neighbour.
    <br>It's not possible to love God without loving our neighbour.
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>Your neighbour can be those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>It's not possible to love God without loving our neighbour
    <br>and many of us don't know the meaning of neighbour.
    <br>They may be those who do not return that love - love them.
    <br>The question I want to ask you: Do you love God?
    <br>How do you demonstrate your love for God?
    <br>If you say you love God, you should know how to demonstrate your love for God.
    <br>How do you demonstrate your love?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You demonstrate it by this Sunday School song.
    <br>My head my shoulders
    <br>My knees my toes
    <br>Sing along with me.
    <br>My head my shoulders
    <br>My knees my toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
    <br>Have your seat.
    <br>If they all belong to Jesus,
    <br>do you know where you normally take these your feet?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The company many of us are working for, the owner of those companies - do you know them?
    <br>Do you know their faith? Do you know where they belong?
    <br>Hypocrisy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The bank that loaned you huge money -
    <br>do you know the owner of the bank, do you know the faith of the owner?
    <br>When you are sick, you don't ask for a Christian doctor to treat you.
    <br>You just ask for the specialist.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You demand for specialist. "I'm sick - specialist!"
    <br>You don't want to know the faith of that man or that woman.
    <br>You just  need to be treated - hypocrisy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When your pastor checks out for medical check-up,
    <br>he never asks who the doctor is that is going to treat him.
    <br>He just wants to get well.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>According to the Book of Matthew 19:19,
    <br>crying, praying, fasting or even paying tithes does not prove our love.
    <br>Praying , fasting, crying does not prove our love.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your love is proven only when you keep His commandments.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>My love is proven only when I keep His commandments.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>My love is proven only when I keep His commandments.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>My love is proven only when I keep His commandments.
    <br>So when you know this, each time you come to church,
    <br>you want to be the elder of the church, whatever you call,
    <br>you want to be shown, you want to be known by your tithes paying, offering or whatever.
    <br>Your love is proven only when you keep His commandments.
    <br>And you know what the commandments say: "Love your neighbour"
    <br>to keep your blessing and to make your blessing permanent today
    <br>His commandment to love is without exception.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And love is the greatest.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask yourself: Do you love God?
    <br>How do you demonstrate your love for God?
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Your neighbour can be those who do not share the same faith, the same ideology,
    <br>the same principle with you - love them all
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is where we are today all over the world because of love without God.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, this is my heart!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, this is my heart!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, this is my heart!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pour our hearts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>He knows your desire.
    <br>He knows you deserve excellence.
    <br>He knows your desire.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Remain silent and talk to Him with all your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Deliverance for those who wait for deliverance!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Open your lips and begin to mention those areas in your life that need deliverance.
    <br>Speak out those areas.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>You can see what is happening at different parts of the church.
    <br>Those areas that need deliverance - mention.
    <br>You have been escaping deliverance in one way or the other -
    <br>it could be your sin, your weakness you have been escaping.
    <br>Right now, those areas in your life that need deliverance - mention.
    <br>Your health, your kidneys, your liver, your tissue, your tendons,
    <br>your heart, your blood, your bones.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>You can see people vomiting out poisonous substances from their system
    <br>Release yourself
    <br>- those areas, nightmares, your business, your marriage.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to mention those areas of challenges - your ministry, your business, your family,
    <br>your spiritual life,
    <br>your health.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>You can see people still vomiting out poisonous substances from their system
    <br>in different parts of the church.
    <br>The anointing of God is descended right now.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
