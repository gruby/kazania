  <p>    
    <br>People sit, awaiting the Living Water Service
    <br>that is about to take place at The SCOAN.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua addresses the crowd
    <br>to prepare their hearts
    <br>before entering The SCOAN Altar,
    <br>knowing that it is not just all up
    <br>to God to receive
    <br>but we also have a role to play.
    <br>Faith works by love.
    <br>You are here today to receive
    <br>and only faith pleases God.
    <br>You can only get there by faith
    <br>if you are to receive the Living Water.
    <br>Listen to the voice of God in your heart
    <br>and come when it is time to come.
    <br>As their hearts agree,
    <br>the people file in a single line,
    <br>onto a queue leading to
    <br>their divine destiny.
    <br>Here they climb the steps
    <br>to the mountain of prayer.
    <br>an area saturated with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The power of God continues
    <br>to separate and uproot
    <br>anything planted by satan in their lives.
    <br>People throng together
    <br>from all walks of life
    <br>to fill their cup with the Living Water.
    <br>Among them is this young girl,
    <br>in a striped top
    <br>who takes the Living Water, sips
    <br>and washes her eyes.
    <br>Moments later, her countenance
    <br>has changed.
    <br>She is shouting and pointing,
    <br>covering her eyes
    <br>from something others around
    <br>don't seem to see.
    <br>A divine revelation is taking place,
    <br>in this young girl's life.
    <br>Let's listen to this supernatural experience,
    <br>Jesus Christ wants us to see.
    <br>What are you seeing?
    <br>There is a man there, He is tall!
    <br>He is wearing a white garment!
    <br>He said, "Repent soon,"
    <br>He is coming.
    <br>"Bring people to My Church;"
    <br>He is coming very soon.
    <br>Bring more souls!"
    <br>My eyes!
    <br>You mean, right now, the light, the brightness is so much.
    <br>He's there. Yes.
    <br>Angels, 24 Elders are there bowing down and singing, "Holy, Holy is the Lamb".
    <br>Yes, He is there.
    <br>Yes, He is tall.
    <br>His face is shining; I can't even see!
    <br>My eyes are blind!
    <br>"Repent!" He is coming soon!
    <br>That is what He is saying!
    <br>My eyes!
    <br>Repent; He is coming soon!
    <br>"Bring more souls for Me in the Church!
    <br>Bring more souls."
    <br>Wow, people of God, let's put our hands
    <br>together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>This is a young girl who is having an
    <br>extraordinary, supernatural encounter.
    <br>As she was coming towards the Living
    <br>Water, she immediately pointed
    <br>and started proclaiming that she is
    <br>seeing a man dressed in white
    <br>and a voice telling the people of God
    <br>to repent and bring more souls.
    <br>SCOAN Altar Experience
    <br>The light is too bright!
    <br>I can't even open my eyes!
    <br>Please remove it!
    <br>It's too bright!
    <br>SCOAN Altar Experience
    <br>He said, "Repent!" He is coming soon!

    <br>"Bring more souls!"
    <br>See! "Repent!
    <br>I'm telling you, repent!"

    <br>SCOAN Altar Experience
    <br>What is happening to you?
    <br>How did you get here?
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>But I saw a man there!
    <br>You said what? You saw...
    <br>I saw a man there!
    <br>- You saw a man?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Tell us how the man looked like.
    <br>The man was wearing a white garment
    <br>and His hair was very long.
    <br>He was wearing a golden crown,
    <br>sitting on a golden chair - like a throne.
    <br>I saw 24 Elders; they were bowing
    <br>and praising His name.
    <br>I saw Angels - Angel Raphael, Uriel, Gabriel -
    <br>they were just bowing before Him.
    <br>Then I saw Jesus.
    <br>He was saying that...
    <br>What was He saying?
    <br>He said, "Repent!" He is coming very soon, that we
    <br>should bring more souls into the Church of God.
    <br>If we don't bring more souls -
    <br>people are already going astray.
    <br>We should bring more souls.
    <br>People are going on the wrong track;
    <br>we should bring them back to the Church.
    <br>He is coming very soon.
    <br>Have you ever seen something
    <br>like this before?
    <br>No.
    <br>You have never seen such?
    <br>I have never seen anything...
    <br>My eyes!
    <br>Are you still seeing anything now?
    <br>No.
    <br>Before I opened my eyes,
    <br>I saw something like smoke.
    <br>Can you stand up and point
    <br>to the direction where you saw
    <br>what you are describing now?
    <br>Point to the direction.
    <br>In the middle - that place.
    <br>He was big.
    <br>He was just standing there.
    <br>On the Altar - that side.
    <br>What was the message
    <br>you were hearing?
    <br>He was saying, "Repent!"
    <br>He is coming very soon.
    <br>When I put the Living Water in my eyes that
    <br>used to itch me, I just saw something bright!
    <br>On His head was a big crown
    <br>and He was sitting on a throne.
    <br>He said we should repent!
    <br>We should bring more people to His Church.
    <br>We couldn't see anything.
    <br>You didn't see anything?
    <br>Nobody.
    <br>I'm telling the truth!
    <br>I saw something there!
    <br>What is your name and
    <br>where do you come from?
    <br>And your age?
    <br>I am 12 years old.
    <br>My name is Gift.
    <br>I'm from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>Where are your parents?
    <br>My mum is there.
    <br>You came with your mum?
    <br>Yes, and my siblings.
    <br>You said, the challenge that
    <br>brought you here was what?
    <br>No, I was just praying. My eyes used to itch me
    <br>sometimes and they were painful.
    <br>So, how are your eyes now
    <br>after you put the Living Water?
    <br>I am okay.
    <br>- No more itching?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Are you still feeling the itching?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- No more itching?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Can you point to us exactly
    <br>where you saw this revelation?
    <br>This side - the Altar side.
    <br>So where the Altar is,
    <br>that is where you saw
    <br>this revelation of Jesus
    <br>with the Angels.
    <br>Yes, this side.
    <br>I saw the 24 Elders bowing
    <br>and praising with us.
    <br>They too were saying
    <br>we should repent.
    <br>That's what I saw.
    <br>Didn't you see anything there?
    <br>Tell us, how did you manage
    <br>to see this
    <br>because we didn't see anything.
    <br>How did you see?
    <br>When I came here, I used little of the
    <br>Living Water to clean my eyes.
    <br>Before I knew it, I started
    <br>seeing light there.
    <br>Then, He started giving me a message that we
    <br>should repent and that He is coming very soon.
    <br>We can see that you are so surprised
    <br>that nobody saw this thing.
    <br>Why are you surprised?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>If I saw it, somebody else should have seen it too
    <br>or all of you should have seen it.
    <br>So what you saw, you were thinking,
    <br>that everyone should have seen it, right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You thought everyone was seeing
    <br>what you were looking at.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But nobody saw it.
    <br>Jesus is coming soon.
    <br>Yes, a moment earlier,
    <br>we saw what happened right here.
    <br>At the very section of the Living Water
    <br>where people are taking the Living Water,
    <br>this little girl was seeing something
    <br>that no one here was able to see
    <br>and giving a vivid description of
    <br>what she was seeing.
    <br>And even right now,
    <br>she is still shedding tears.
    <br>We want to ask her
    <br>why she is shedding tears.
    <br>Sister, what is happening?
    <br>We can see you shedding tears.
    <br>I am shocked about what happened.
    <br>Why is it only me who saw this?
    <br>Am I the only one in the church?
    <br>Everyone is meant to see it.
    <br>I don't know why it is happening to me.
    <br>This is so heavy for me to bear.
    <br>I need to see the man of God about this
    <br>because if we don't save souls now,
    <br>I don't know what will happen.
    <br>I am surprised that nobody saw it.
    <br>Nobody could see it.
    <br>He was there.
    <br>Smoke just puffed out and
    <br>I could not see Him again.
    <br>He was there.
    <br>I don't know why all of you didn't see Him.
    <br>Everyone was praising Him;
    <br>the 24 Elders were bowing before Him.
    <br>It was very clear to me.
    <br>I am very surprised that nobody saw it.
    <br>Is that why you are shedding tears?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I am worried. If people don't go
    <br>to Heaven, God will be angry.
    <br>Please take me to the man of God.
    <br>Let me see him and tell him that
    <br>we need to win more souls to the Church.
