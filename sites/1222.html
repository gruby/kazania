  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your neighbour behind you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your neighbour in front of you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>Whilst we are still standing, please join me and thank God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are no words that can describe what God has used Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>not only to do in my life but to do in this generation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Blessed are our eyes for seeing what we have seen
    <br>and blessed are our ears for hearing what we have heard.
    <br>A prophet is in our midst.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now, you may have your seats, in the presence of God, and say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Chris,
    <br>and by the special grace of God, I have the opportunity today to share with you
    <br>the sweet story of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>It is the greatest privilege on earth to be able to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ
    <br>to all of you and all the viewers on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Last week, we received a very wonderful message from Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>which was titled, ‘The Greatest Achievement On Earth’.
    <br>Now, who can remind me: What is the greatest achievement on earth?
    <br>I hope you have been watching the sermon on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>What is the greatest achievement on earth?
    <br>If someone can remind me of what Prophet T.B. Joshua said last week?
    <br>Remember; it is not in terms of material possessions, wealth, position - no.
    <br>What is the greatest achievement here on earth?
    <br>Can anyone remind me?
    <br>OK.
    <br>Good morning, Church.
    <br>Last week we heard that the greatest achievement on earth is to pray as God wants us to pray.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Amen; let's put our hands together for our sister.
    <br>Yes, that is the greatest achievement on earth.
    <br>We are not just talking about the prayer of the lips.
    <br>We are talking about the prayer of the heart
    <br>because the heart of prayer is prayer from the heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, the heart of prayer is prayer from the heart".
    <br>We are going to talk about the heart today – the ‘man himself’.
    <br>Tell you neighbour, "The man himself".
    <br>That is the real you, the true you – the heart.
    <br>We are going to talk about the need for us to take care of our hearts.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Take care of your heart".
    <br>We know, as 1 Thessalonians 5:23 says that
    <br>man is a divine being possessed of spirit, soul and body.
    <br>In other words, you are a spirit living in the physical body, learning to live in the natural world.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am a spirit".
    <br>The real thing about you is your spirit, is your heart.
    <br>That is the real thing about you.
    <br>That is the communication point for God, the contact point, the landing point,
    <br>the strong room, the powerhouse – the heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Take care of your heart”.
    <br>We also read in John 4:24 that
    <br>God Himself is Spirit and those who worship Him must do so in Spirit and in truth.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>If we do not worship God who is a Spirit, in the Spirit, we miss the end of worship.
    <br>We miss the point.
    <br>If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing – in vain.
    <br>This is what happens when your church service turns into a ceremony.
    <br>You know the time the service begins, you know the time the service ends,
    <br>you know the pre-planned program for the day, who will preach the title of the sermon for the next four weeks,
    <br>because the Holy Spirit is not the one releasing the words.
    <br>If the Holy Spirit does not release the words,
    <br>you may speak the truth but you are just speaking today’s language.
    <br>That truth cannot penetrate the hearts.
    <br>It can strike the ear, but not ring in the conscience.
    <br>Until today’s church realises that the spirit of man, the heart of man
    <br>is the fountain of faith, only then will the Holy Spirit begin to be involved in our affairs.
    <br>God is Spirit; you too are spirit.
    <br>The Word of God is Spirit.
    <br>So for you to have a relationship with Him, it must be in the Spirit, in the heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Take care of your heart”.
    <br>Let's turn to our proof text for today's message, which is the Book of Matthew 23.
    <br>I will read from verse 1; the main text we will be going to is from verses 25-27.
    <br>So, verse 1:
    <br>“Then Jesus said to the crowds and to His disciples:
    <br>‘The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.
    <br>So you must be careful to do everything they tell you.
    <br>But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.’”
    <br>Now, let's move to verse 25.
    <br>Remember, this is our Lord, Jesus Christ speaking to His people.
    <br>Verse 25:
    <br>“’Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!
    <br>You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
    <br>Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will also be clean.'"
    <br>Verse 27:
    <br>“’Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!
    <br>You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside
    <br>but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.’”
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, take care of your heart".
    <br>Jesus was describing a situation where someone cares for their flesh,
    <br>their appearance, their external and neglect their heart -
    <br>the real you, the true you – the ‘man himself’.
    <br>Now, I want to try to use an example, based on the Scripture that may relate to us in a more clear-cut way.
    <br>Just imagine; you have had a long day at work, you have worked hard, tirelessly,
    <br>and you are coming home to eat, and you know that your favourite food has been prepared.
    <br>And when you get back to your home, you see the food prepared...
    <br>You are tired, stressed, you have had a long day, you are hungry and you see a beautiful plate of food,
    <br>beautifully presented, looking wonderful, beautifully prepared.
    <br>Let me just ask someone.
    <br>Sir, what is your favourite food?
    <br>Pap & rice.
    <br>Pap & rice - let's clap for our brother.
    <br>I think that's South African, right?
    <br>Wonderful - pap & rice.
    <br>Just imagine; you have a beautiful dish of pap & rice.
    <br>Now, the moment you eat that food, you discover that the content is rotten.
    <br>How would you feel?
    <br>Disappointed and terrible.
    <br>No matter how beautiful the food looks, no matter how wonderfully it is presented,
    <br>if the content is not the same as the presentation, is disgusting, is rotten,
    <br>then the food is worthless.
    <br>Would you agree with me?
    <br>Such is the case of someone who values only the flesh, the appearance, the material possessions,
    <br>and neglects his heart.
    <br>Take care of your heart.
    <br>Let me try to use an example in relation to those of us here in the church today.
    <br>Remember, you are what is in your heart.
    <br>I am what is in my heart.
    <br>My life reflects what is in my heart.
    <br>So many people come to church today and their reason, their basis of coming to church
    <br>is because they want something from God.
    <br>Perhaps they want a miracle, healing, deliverance, breakthrough in their business,
    <br>prosperity, abundance - just name it.
    <br>They have come because of what they want from God.
    <br>But remember what Prophet T.B. Joshua said:
    <br>The heart is a landing point.
    <br>If there is an obstacle or an obstruction, God cannot land with His cargo of blessings.
    <br>Let's try and picture this.
    <br>By the grace of God, I know many of us have been privileged to travel by aircraft - we have flown.
    <br>Many of us even flew here.
    <br>Just imagine when you are coming in to land on your aircraft;
    <br>you look out - if you see the tarmac, where the plane is going to land,
    <br>you will see that everything is clear.
    <br>No obstruction, no obstacle, no hindrance - because if there is an obstacle at the point of landing,
    <br>the plane cannot successfully land.
    <br>Would you agree with me?
    <br>Can I have one chair please?
    <br>One chair.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I just want you to picture this, so you can understand what's happening when we come to church
    <br>seeking a miracle without taking care of our hearts.
    <br>This is the landing point.
    <br>This is the tarmac.
    <br>This is the area where the plane wants to land, but there is an obstacle,
    <br>there is a hindrance, there is a barrier!
    <br>No matter how fervently you pray, how passionately you worship, how you fast;
    <br>you do all night vigil - so far as the obstacle is still there, the plane cannot land.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many of us start running from one place to another, trying to find solution,
    <br>not knowing that the problem is within us.
    <br>We have not removed the obstacle!
    <br>There is still an obstruction!
    <br>There is still something blocking us!
    <br>And we are busy going to this church, that church, this crusade, that crusade...
    <br>Before you know it, you get anointed water here, anointed oil here,
    <br>anointed pyjama here, anointed underwear here.
    <br>What other anointing do you want?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You run from man of God to man of God, but the problem is within you.
    <br>There is an obstacle!
    <br>And you know what happens?
    <br>This is the painful part.
    <br>By the time you run up and down, look for solution and you don't seem to see that blessing coming,
    <br>you hear the noise of the plane going over you and missing you -
    <br>someone else is receiving a blessing, someone else is receiving a touch
    <br>and you say, "Why not me?"
    <br>You begin to look at God in a bad light.
    <br>Perhaps He doesn't love me, perhaps He loves this person more than me,
    <br>perhaps my sin is too much that He cannot forgive.
    <br>And what happens when you look at God in a bad light and frustration and desperation comes?
    <br>Before you know it, you will find yourself being deceived.
    <br>Let me have another chair.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Just imagine; you, that are looking to remove the obstacle,
    <br>by the time, in that frustration, desperation someone says, "Let's go here".
    <br>You go there and you find yourself in the house of a spiritualist,
    <br>where you are touched by someone who is not supposed to touch you,
    <br>where you taste what a Christian is not supposed to taste.
    <br>Rather than removing the obstacle, you only seem to increase it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It only seems to be getting worse!
    <br>Then what happens?
    <br>You begin to look for imaginary enemies.
    <br>"That my aunt cursed me when I was young. She is the cause.
    <br>That my grandmother - oh God; God will deal with her."
    <br>What happens? What's going on?
    <br>As a result of that - another obstacle!
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>Another one!
    <br>You begin to say, "That my business partner duped me; he is the cause.
    <br>God will punish him. God will deal with him."
    <br>When you sit back in your setback, you wallow in your self-pity - what happens?
    <br>You begin to try and create happiness outside of God, "Let me just take some alcohol".
    <br>As you take the alcohol - what happens?
    <br>Another one!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And you want the plane to land?
    <br>You want God to come with His cargo of blessings; peace, joy, abundance, all the promises in the Scriptures,
    <br>you want them to be released unto your life, but your heart is filled with obstacles.
    <br>This is offence; you have not forgiven that person that offended you last year,
    <br>and you are here in the church today, "God, bless me. God, heal me. God, deliver me. God, set me free."
    <br>Remove offence and the blessing will come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What am I trying to say brethren?
    <br>When you take care of your heart, God will take care of your miracle.
    <br>When you take care of your heart, God will take care of your blessing.
    <br>When you take care of your heart, God will take care of your success.
    <br>Stop looking for imaginary enemies around you and start looking within.
    <br>Tell your neighbour; say, "Neighbour,
    <br>take care of your heart; God will take care of your blessing".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>By the time you take care of your heart and the obstacles are removed,
    <br>there’s free access for the Spirit of God to land and release unto you the abundance of His provision.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you look at what is happening in the society today,
    <br>you will realise that it is common for people to value their material possessions above their heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is contrary to what the Scriptures teach us.
    <br>In the Word of God we realise that the Word of God, a Spirit, creates material things -
    <br>proving that the spirit is greater than material.
    <br>Why then do we place value more on our material possessions, than our hearts?
    <br>When Job 1:21 says,
    <br>“Naked I came from my mother’s womb and naked shall I return.”
    <br>What are you fighting over today, what are you squabbling, struggling, striving over today?
    <br>Your property, position, possession, what people say about you, how people look at you...
    <br>Your concern is so much about today - you are not going to carry it to the grave.
    <br>The Spirit returns to God who gave it and the flesh returns to the dust.
    <br>Ecclesiastes 12:7
    <br>The urge to store up treasures here on earth
    <br>is the cause of killing, stealing, destruction and corruption today
    <br>but how much of those things will you carry with you to eternity?
    <br>Vanity upon vanity - all is...
    <br>Why can't we take care of our hearts?
    <br>You know, it's a practical thing; physically to have a healthy body.
    <br>You don't take what you know is poisonous.
    <br>You are told that this food, ingredients is poisonous,
    <br>if you take it, you are going to fall sick, perhaps even die.
    <br>Why would anyone take something that they know is poisonous, destructive, corruptive?
    <br>To have a healthy body, you don't take what you know is poisonous.
    <br>To have a healthy heart, don’t feed on offence.
    <br>Don’t feed on bitterness, resentment or bad feelings towards anyone.
    <br>I'm not saying they will not come.
    <br>In this world there will be trouble, test, offence - they will come,
    <br>but don't harbour them in your hearts.
    <br>Don't create room for them in your hearts.
    <br>Your heart is too precious to just give to the fruits of the flesh.
    <br>Your heart is too valuable to just give to the things of the world.
    <br>Whenever you are cheated, pause and consider your conscience.
    <br>Someone cheats you, embarrasses you, insults you;
    <br>don't just retaliate, respond, react.
    <br>Pause! Consider your conscience.
    <br>My heart is too valuable to start fighting flesh and blood; I leave the battle for God.
    <br>My heart is too precious to start exchanging words with flesh and blood; I leave the issue for God.
    <br>Because your response determines your future.
    <br>Read the Book of Ephesians 4:30-32.
    <br>The Holy Spirit cannot share with a heart full of offence, unforgiveness and pain of the past.
    <br>He can't come, He can't land to release His blessings, peace, abundance of His promises,
    <br>if your heart is still full of offence.
    <br>Why can’t you let go, leave the issue with God and take care of what matters?
    <br>The secret place is a sacred place.
    <br>Anytime you have an appointment for your possessions,
    <br>remember the Creator of your possessions.
    <br>Anytime you have an appointment for your possessions, position, wealth, money, business,
    <br>remember the Creator, who is not one of those things - He is the only thing, the only reason.
    <br>Some think they have everything when money comes their way; wealth,
    <br>but that they are poor would be revealed on God's accounting day.
    <br>The rich may seem to prosper now; the wicked may seem to prosper now and live without a care -
    <br>they will spend eternity in terror and despair.
    <br>Why would we now use material possessions as a yardstick to measure our relationship with God?
    <br>I remember several years ago, and I'm sure you are aware of this...
    <br>Several years ago there was an article that was written on the internet, it was circulated and spread;
    <br>social media continued to spread this article saying, "These are the richest men of God.
    <br>They have x-amounts of money, x-amounts of this... Richest men of God".
    <br>That article was spread everywhere.
    <br>They even included the name of our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>But I want to tell you one thing, and you know this as well,
    <br>because you've studied the lifestyle of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Whether today he has 5 dollars or 5 billion dollars, you will not see any difference in him.
    <br>You will not see any change,
    <br>because this ministry of the Holy Spirit is not about making money; it’s about saving souls.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How can we begin to use material possessions as a yardstick to measure success?
    <br>Do you know that the true measure of spiritual enrichment is contentment -
    <br>peace that surpasses all understanding, peace in the midst of the storm
    <br>and joy in the midst of the troubles.
    <br>Contentment – I am what God says I am, I have what God says I have
    <br>and I can do what God says I can do.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Contentment - that is the dividend of your relationship with God.
    <br>The Spirit is greater than the material.
    <br>Why can't we take care of our hearts, clean our hearts?
    <br>The management of our hearts and its thoughts is fundamental to our faith and holy living.
    <br>Fundamental.
    <br>It is not just trivial, something you just take by the side - it's fundamental to take care of your hearts.
    <br>Look inward.
    <br>The heart connects us to Jesus, to Him - it's all about the heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Once you can control your heart, you control your life.
    <br>You can get your heart to your side, temptation may come -
    <br>you quickly rebuke and reject those doubts, fears.
    <br>Refuse to take counsel with fear; refuse to entertain doubt.
    <br>Doubts must be refused and resolutely resisted.
    <br>Take captive your thoughts in obedience to Christ.
    <br>They will come.
    <br>Thoughts may come and persist in staying but you refuse to put them into words
    <br>and so they die unborn.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, to take care of your heart, your heart must be tuned to God’s Word.
    <br>Tuned, in harmony with the Word of God.
    <br>If you make God your heart’s delight, you will surely have your heart’s desires.
    <br>In conclusion:
    <br>you must balance your life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Balance your life".
    <br>Anytime you nourish your physical body with natural food,
    <br>remember to nourish your soul with spiritual food.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Anytime you look in the mirror, check your appearance, clothes, dressing - that is fine;
    <br>remember to check the state of your heart.
    <br>The mirror only reveals the shell; the true me lies in the heart.
    <br>Don't let the mirror deceive you.
    <br>Anytime you take a shower, clean yourself in the morning, remove any dirt, anything in your body;
    <br>remember to clean your heart.
    <br>Is your heart free from care, worry, anxiety, offence?
    <br>These are poisonous to your spirit, heart, and block you from receiving God's blessings.
    <br>Anytime you go out in the morning to fend for your family, to work for your daily bread, earn a living -
    <br>it's good; I'm not trying to tell you you can't do that - you must, of course.
    <br>Take care of your spiritual life because that is the engine that carries your success.
    <br>You can have a beautiful car, the latest model, the most fantasticly presented -
    <br>if there is no engine, can the car work?
    <br>Why would you be so consumed by painting the car, getting the latest design, and there is no engine,
    <br>or the engine is broken?
    <br>Take care of your heart, the ‘man himself’ – the real you, the true you.
    <br>You can be emotionally or physically stressed,
    <br>but please, please, do not be spiritually stressed.
    <br>Because if you are, you would lose focus on God.
    <br>Focusing on you may lead to stress but focusing on God leads to rest.
    <br>When you become God-minded, Word-minded, the Word of God dominates your heart -
    <br>your heart will unconsciously go to Him for guidance, wisdom, strength, provision, protection.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, in Jesus’ name.
