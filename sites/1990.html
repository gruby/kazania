  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>God with us.
    <br>If God is with us,
    <br>who can be against us?
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I am going to take this message:
    <br>YOUR CONDITION
    <br>Let someone say, "My condition."
    <br>The question: What is your condition?
    <br>Because of our condition, we cannot reason well.
    <br>We lose focus.
    <br>What is my condition?
    <br>What is your condition?
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of Matthew 4.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>He is everywhere, inside you, within, outside.
    <br>What you are thinking - He knows.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Matthew 4; let's quickly look at our Saviour here.
    <br>"Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
    <br>And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights,
    <br>afterwards He was hungry."
    <br>That was His condition at that time - He was hungry.
    <br>And you know what it means, because satan realised this...
    <br>Knowing that Jesus was hungry, satan tempted Him with bread.
    <br>Satan uses our situation to tempt us.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Are you sick?
    <br>Satan will now begin to talk to you,
    <br>"That sickness you have - remember that man died because of that sickness."
    <br>That situation you are in is a generational curse.
    <br>Satan uses our situation to tempt us.
    <br>He keeps talking to you through that situation.
    <br>"Remember, no one has ever got to a certain position in your family,
    <br>that is why you have not got there" - he keeps talking to you.
    <br>Satan uses our situation to distract us from running the straight race with God.
    <br>You want to be faithful to God, you want to be kind, nice, honest
    <br>but this situation does not allow you.
    <br>You want to be an obedient child, you know the right thing.
    <br>You know you were created for the glory of God.
    <br>You know the right thing is to live for God, but because of your situation
    <br>you keep lying, you have to lie.
    <br>You know where you are working - you must do this, that.
    <br>Satan uses our situation to distract us from running the straight race.
    <br>The straight race is...
    <br>... but because of your situation...
    <br>You keep going this way and that way.
    <br>Today, you are born again, "Hallelujah!" - you answer an altar call,
    <br>but next month, when they make the altar call, you come out,
    <br>you say, "I want to rededicate myself."
    <br>Now, you have done something, you know you are no more a child of God.
    <br>"Jesus, forgive me" - you are born again today.
    <br>Another time, you want to rededicate yourself.
    <br>That is not a straight race.
    <br>In Matthew 4:4:
    <br>"But He answered and said, 'It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone. ' ' "
    <br>Jesus said to him that man shall not live by bread alone.
    <br>I may be hungry but I am not anxious about food.
    <br>No doubt about that - I am very very hungry but I am not anxious.
    <br>The problem we have now is that we are anxious.
    <br>When you are poor and anxiously in need of blessing,
    <br>you will not mind the source of your supplies.
    <br>Whether from God or from satan, you will take it.
    <br>This is God,
    <br>my God forever and ever
    <br>and He will show me my way until death.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is God,
    <br>my God forever and ever
    <br>and He will show me the way until death."
    <br>Stand up and tell your neighbour, "This is God,"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[This is God]
    <br>my God forever and ever
    <br>and He will show me the way until death.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Jesus said to him, "Man shall not live by bread alone."
    <br>By what?
    <br>This is God.
    <br>By the Word of God.
    <br>This is God.
    <br>The steps of a good man are led by God and he is happy in His way.
    <br>When you are poor and anxiously in need of blessing,
    <br>you will not mind the source of your supplies, whether from God or satan - you will take it.
    <br>This is the problem we are facing today.
    <br>That is why you run.
    <br>A man may be poor and yet by a friend of God.
    <br>A man may want bread and yet be a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>A man may be sick in body and yet be a favourite of Heaven.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You should not be misled..."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>You should not be misled by your condition because
    <br>a man may be poor and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>The mind of a man plans his way but the Lord shows him what to do.
    <br>We should not be misled by our condition.
    <br>The rich must not concentrate on his wealth,
    <br>while the poor should not concentrate on his poverty.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The rich should not concentrate on his wealth,
    <br>while the poor should not concentrate on his poverty."
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>... because you are sick.
    <br>The sick should not concentrate on their sickness.
    <br>If you want to serve God with truth and faith,
    <br>the poor should not concentrate on their poverty.
    <br>The rich should not concentrate on their wealth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The rich must not concentrate on their wealth,"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[The rich must not concentrate on their wealth,]
    <br>"while the poor should not concentrate on their poverty.
    <br>The sick should not concentrate on their sickness,
    <br>if they want to serve God in truth and faith."
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Let me quickly take you in conclusion to the Book of Colossians 3:1-3.
    <br>"If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above..."
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Listen to what He is saying.
    <br>If you claim that you were raised with Christ, seek those things that are above.
    <br>You say you are raised with Christ.
    <br>If you are raised with Christ, then seek those things that are above.
    <br>Let your mind rise and seek things that are above
    <br>so that you will be comforted under your present situation.
    <br>If you seek those things that are above, no matter the situation you are in
    <br>that will not break your joy.
    <br>As the Bible says in John 14:27,
    <br>"The peace I give, not as the world gives it."
    <br>The peace that God gives is put for all good.
    <br>That is, that thing God gives is put for all good - everything about it is just good.
    <br>The back of it is good, the front of it is good, left is good, right is good.
    <br>In the face of difficulty that thing will stand by you.
    <br>Not that kind of peace that will leave you in the face of trouble.
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>While the one that the world gives is time bound.
    <br>I want to encourage you in this difficult time.
    <br>Jesus is our hope.
    <br>In this difficult time, Jesus is our hope.
    <br>If Jesus is your hope, let your mind rise and seek things that are above
    <br>so that you would be comforted under the present situation.
    <br>Whether your situation is this or... when you seek...
    <br>When you seek things that are above, you will not base faith
    <br>on your improvement after prayer.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus... I want bread..."
    <br>As a Christian, Jesus knows the best.
    <br>The bread may be not the best for you.
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>It honours Jesus to believe in Him even while every sense contradicts Him.
    <br>I want to move; "Lord Jesus, help me to move this mountain.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, move this mountain for me."
    <br>And each time I open my eyes, the mountain is still there.
    <br>If truly I am a faith man, whether Jesus moves this mountain or not, He is my God.
    <br>Whether He moves this mountain or not, He is my Saviour.
    <br>Whether He moves this mountain or not, He is my Redeemer.
    <br>Whether He moves this mountain or not, He is my...
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>But what has happened to you?
    <br>Each time your mountain does not seem to move,
    <br>you stop running the straight race.
    <br>You begin to look for alternatives.
    <br>You pray less, you fast less,
    <br>instead of praying the more, fasting the more.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer."
    <br>I know you are prepared now to receive.
    <br>These are things you need to know.
    <br>If truly you are a Christian, your situation sometimes may be to preserve you,
    <br>to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>It may be to stop you a while.
    <br>Cancer stopped many from drinking alcohol.
    <br>When you get to a doctor, he says, "You have two weeks left."
    <br>"Doctor, you say what?"
    <br>"This is it - look at it. If you live two weeks more..
    <br>I have never seen anybody that still continued to live above two weeks with this condition."
    <br>"Doctor, tell me what to do now. What can I do?
    <br>My children are there, my house. I suffered..."
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>"I am the breadwinner in the family. Doctor!"
    <br>The doctor says, "No. Take is easy."
    <br>"I suffer. Doctor."
    <br>"You suffer what?"
    <br>"You say I will die in 2 weeks time."
    <br>"I am not the one that says you will die. I say this thing - go and write your will."
    <br>"I should write what?"
    <br>"Write your will."
    <br>- "Doctor, what will I do?"
    <br>- "Yes."
    <br>"Stop smoking, stop drinking."
    <br>"That will solve the problem?"
    <br>"If you stop it, that cancer will gradually... It will not increase again."
    <br>"Smoking, drinking - that is the end?
    <br>Let me call my child, 'Hello. Help me - I don't want to see any cigarettes anywhere.
    <br>Right now, I hate the odour, I dislike it.' "
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>This is what the Words of God have been warning you every day, but death is now the one -
    <br>merely hearing that you will die.
    <br>Brothers and sisters - you are here; I want to say, "Welcome."
    <br>We have different groups here today.
    <br>"Over my dead body, I will never enter that Synagogue."
    <br>Thank you. You are welcome. Your body is here today.
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>"That man - I will never have anything to do with that man."
    <br>Glory be to God - this man seems to be your benefactor.
    <br>You are welcome here - that man.
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>"Switch off that channel. I don't want to see that man. Turn it off."
    <br>You are welcome.
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>You are welcome.
    <br>It is the Lord's doing.
    <br>It is the Lord - there is nothing we can do.
    <br>He who respects the power above him must be respected.
    <br>DON'T LET YOUR CONDITION MISLEAD YOU!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Right now, what you are about to see; healing, deliverance...
    <br>We have not done anything to bring about what you are about to see.
    <br>All we are doing is giving back what we have been given from His generous hand.
    <br>Everything comes from Him.
    <br>Everything we have is actually only being borrowed from God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
