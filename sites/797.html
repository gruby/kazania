    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Biliki.
    <br>I am 25 years old.
    <br>I am from Nigeria but I reside in Cameroon.
    <br>Who is the lady standing beside you?
    <br>This is my mum.
    <br>She is from Nigeria too.
    <br>Tell us your story; how this evil spirit began to operate in your life right from a young age.
    <br>It started when I was little, 10 years old.
    <br>One day I was eating and I sent my junior brother to bring me some water.
    <br>Then I threw a spoon and my mum said that I wanted to kill my younger brother.
    <br>I said, "No".
    <br>She went somewhere and when she came back, she said they told her not to beat me
    <br>as I has something on me.
    <br>She asked me if it was true and I told her no.
    <br>I asked her, "Am I a king? Why are you pleading with me?"
    <br>She said it was because I had something on me, that I had a spirit of ogbanje (marine spirit) in me.
    <br>You mean that at a little age, your mum actually told you that she could not beat you
    <br>because there was an evil spirit of ogbanje in you?
    <br>She said that the evil spirit was disturbing her and had blocked her way
    <br>for her not to have anything good in her life.
    <br>After she told me that, I became angry and ran away from home in 2003.
    <br>I went to a beach; there was a lady...
    <br>How old were you when you ran away from home?
    <br>I was 15 years old.
    <br>I saw a lady at a beach who told me that she wanted to take me somewhere.
    <br>We were about 10 in number.
    <br>She would always sell girls.
    <br>When she saw me, she said that I was still little, that she would not be able to sell me,
    <br>that she would keep me for herself.
    <br>She told me that she wanted to take me out of the country.
    <br>She took me to Cotonou.
    <br>When we arrived there, she told me that we were going to do the work of prostitution.
    <br>When we started, we were about 10.
    <br>She sold the rest of the girls but didn’t sell me.
    <br>She said it was because I was a little girl.
    <br>How old were you when you went for prostitution?
    <br>I was 15 years old.
    <br>You said that the girls that were carried there - the lady in question sold them...
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But she didn't sell me because I was little.
    <br>Later, when I started, I saw a man who asked, "You little girl, come over; what are you doing here?"
    <br>I told him I was from Nigeria, that a lady had brought me there.
    <br>He asked why she had brought me there.
    <br>I told him it was for prostitution, that she said I was going to pay her some money - 200,000 naira.
    <br>The man told me to call the lady.
    <br>I called the lady for him and the man asked her,
    <br>"Why did you bring this little girl to this country to become a prostitute?"
    <br>He then gave her money and took me to a place to stay alone.
    <br>After two weeks, the man left.
    <br>When the man left, I started work, serving in a nightclub.
    <br>Men would come to me after serving them and would give me their numbers.
    <br>I would meet them and they would sleep with me.
    <br>For six years, I didn’t have any communication with my mum; no one knew where I was.
    <br>During the period you ran away from your family, nobody knew where you were?
    <br>No, nobody knew where I was for over six years.
    <br>One day, I went somewhere and the spiritualist gave me something to bathe with
    <br>so that I would be able to go home.
    <br>When I went home, I was so angry with my mum.
    <br>When I was little, I would always go to my grandmother's place.
    <br>She would give me a tablet, something like a charm
    <br>and she would ask me what I took when I went to my grandmother's place.
    <br>I would reply, "I told you I didn’t want to go there; she gave me some drugs".
    <br>As a result of those charms, I knew I was possessed with something that disturbed me
    <br>like the spirit of witchcraft because I couldn’t control myself.
    <br>The evil spirit would always push me to go out and didn't want me to stay with my family.
    <br>When you returned to Nigeria, you knew that this spirit was within you,
    <br>because you always had an urge to go out.
    <br>You didn't want to be with your family or stay with your parents whatsoever.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I didn’t want to see any of them.
    <br>That was 2012 when I went to Niger.
    <br>I went to a herbalist as I wanted the evil spirit to be sent out of me.
    <br>I gave him money.
    <br>He bathed me and performed a ritual.
    <br>In 2012, I came back and shouted at my mum and asked her,
    <br>"When you gave birth to me, who bathed me?"
    <br>She started crying.
    <br>I ran away from home again and went to Cameroon.
    <br>Sorry. Before going ahead - you said that when you went to Niger, you went to a particular spiritualist.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We can see some pictures here.
    <br>Is this what happened to you? Just explain what we are seeing here.
    <br>In this picture, I gave the woman money – 200,000 naira.
    <br>She said she was going to remove the evil spirit from me.
    <br>After giving her the money, she went to buy beads and other items.
    <br>She bathed me, took me to the front of a masquerade and performed the ritual.
    <br>After everything, I noticed that nothing had changed in my life.
    <br>I later came back home and started crying with my mum.
    <br>I didn’t stay more than two or three days before getting angry.
    <br>I didn’t want to see them or be with them.
    <br>So, I went to Cameroon and started work as a…
    <br>What we are understanding from our sister is that right from a very young age, 15 years,
    <br>she has run away from home.
    <br>She has not been with her parents or her family.
    <br>They have not known her whereabouts.
    <br>Even if she returned back home, it would just be for a few days, before that spirit pushed her to leave again
    <br>without any communication with her family.
    <br>She is explaining what we are seeing in the pictures here.
    <br>In the country of Niger she went to a particular spiritualist to do a ritual, which involved purchasing
    <br>a lot of different items, clothing, beads - all for the reason of removing the evil spirit in her life.
    <br>Despite all of these efforts, the problem still continued.
    <br>She returned back to Nigeria.
    <br>Within two days of being with her family, she ran away again.
    <br>Sister, where did you go to at this point?
    <br>I went to Cameroon.
    <br>I started working in Cameroon as a strip dancer.
    <br>Men would normally come to me and give me money, telling me I was a good dancer.
    <br>Miss Biliki & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>After dancing, men would give me their numbers and I would tell them I would see them after work.
    <br>One day there was a lady...
    <br>You mean in Cameroon you began working at a strip club as a strip dancer?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you were also continuing the same lifestyle of prostitution?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I would dance naked.
    <br>The men would throw money on me.
    <br>I got tired of all that I was doing.
    <br>I went to a place where I saw a woman and I explained my situation to her.
    <br>She said she didn't have anything to give me,
    <br>that what she had to give me was for me to go to T.B. Joshua at The SCOAN.
    <br>She said he would be able to deliver me.
    <br>She spoke to me on Wednesday and I decided to leave Cameroon on Thursday to arrive here on Saturday.
    <br>On my way coming, I would always go to a native doctor and pay them money
    <br>after which they would want to sleep with me
    <br>and tell me that the spirit that was on me, they would have to remove it by their power
    <br>but that they would have to sleep with me.
    <br>On my way coming here, I decided to test the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to know if he was really a man of God and was able to locate me.
    <br>On Sunday when I came here, I was sitting down there and as he was prophesying to people,
    <br>I was looking at him thinking, "Are you really a man of God? Why can't you see me?"
    <br>As the prayer was going on, I held onto my leg tight because I didn't want to fall
    <br>but I don’t know how come I found myself on the floor.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>This was what happened last week here at The SCOAN.
    <br>We just want you to explain again, sister.
    <br>You said your reason of coming here was to test the man of God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Why was that?
    <br>Because I had been to many places and they would always charge me money
    <br>and later, sleep with me but nothing good would come out of it.
    <br>So, I came here to test him to know if he was really a man of God.
    <br>But I noticed that he did not even look at me, he just turned his back to me.
    <br>Then, during the mass prayer - what happened to you at that moment when the man of God began to pray?
    <br>When he started praying, I stood there and was very angry
    <br>because he didn’t even look at me or come closer to me.
    <br>He was here and I was sitting down there.
    <br>I was very angry and decided that if I left, I would not come back here again.
    <br>Miss Biliki & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I didn't know what came over me.
    <br>I saw myself at the back there.
    <br>That was how the evil spirit was exposed.
    <br>After the deliverance, when I slept, I had a dream that I saw a snake.
    <br>I always dreamt about the snake.
    <br>The snake always hit my head.
    <br>In my dream, I saw a woman and a man digging something out of the ground.
    <br>I saw a cobra.
    <br>I turned my back and when I did that, it felt as if someone had thrown the snake on me.
    <br>There was a little boy who told me that the snake was on my back and I woke up.
    <br>Sorry to cut in.
    <br>You mean to say that immediately after your deliverance, the same snake that we saw manifest
    <br>during this mass prayer, was revealed to you in your dream as an evidence that you were set free?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you said that coming back to Nigeria, you had not seen your mum for how long?
    <br>Four years.
    <br>You mean to say that after the deliverance you have now seen your mum for the first time?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We can imagine what this evil spirit has caused in the life of our sister.
    <br>She is standing here with her mother right now.
    <br>She has not seen or communicated with her mum for so many years.
    <br>From the age of 15 she has been a runaway from home, only to return to her mum for a few days.
    <br>For the last four years she has not been with her mum because that evil spirit always pushed her
    <br>to leave the house, run away from the family and to have such a hatred towards her parents.
    <br>As you are seeing your mum right now after your deliverance, sister, what do you have to say?
    <br>Actually, I went home on Monday.
    <br>I called someone to go with me so that I would be able to take my mum's number
    <br>but upon getting there, I don't know what came over me.
    <br>I shouted our lastborn's name, "Abigail!"
    <br>That was when my mum came out, looked at me and asked, "Why?"
    <br>Then, I started crying.
    <br>That was when she told me that my father was no longer alive, that he had died two years ago.
    <br>You didn't even know that your father had died?
    <br>No.
    <br>Once again, viewers all over the world, we thank God for our sister's deliverance.
    <br>As she was explaining before, it was as a result of that evil spirit,
    <br>that entered her right from such a young age, to the extent that she hated her family.
    <br>She didn't even know when her own father died.
    <br>We thank God; today she is here with her mum and her eyes have been opened.
    <br>After the deliverance she realised that she has a mum and they are back together.
    <br>Sister, what can you say to the glory of God, after your deliverance?
    <br>How has your life changed?
    <br>My life has changed.
    <br>I didn’t know what came over me. I am not the same.
    <br>I even changed my name to Jessica
    <br>because I didn't want to use my real name while doing something stupid.
    <br>I had to change my name to Jessica.
    <br>Now, my real name is Biliki, no longer Jessica.
    <br>I thank God for my life and that now, I am with my mum.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>You mean to say, sister, before coming to The SCOAN, you were coming from that strip club in Cameroon?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I lied to my boss that I wasn’t feeling fine and wanted to relax for three weeks.
    <br>He said, "OK, there is no problem".
    <br>That is why I am here.
    <br>Now, after your deliverance, how do you want to go about your life?
    <br>Do you still have the mind of returning to that kind of life-style of prostitution, strip dancing?
    <br>No! I really want God to help me because I can't do it on my own.
    <br>That is why I am here.
    <br>I am tired.
    <br>I want my family to change.
    <br>I want everything to change about my life, my mum and my younger ones.
    <br>I really want people to help me because I have nobody except my mum.
    <br>If they could help me, I would be so glad.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Once again, we know that Jesus Christ through this deliverance has opened the door.
    <br>Our sister - you can see the tears in her eyes as a result of now regretting her past life
    <br>and having the opportunity to reconcile with her family after the deliverance.
    <br>We know that the same God who has delivered you, will definitely usher you towards the breakthrough,
    <br>that He has in store for you tomorrow.
    <br>Finally sister, what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world, based on your experiences in life?
    <br>My advice to viewers all over the world, girls like me – there is nothing there.
    <br>I thank God that I came out alive.
    <br>There are many girls – most of my friends whom we were together, most of them have died.
    <br>Some of them are miserable but I am still alive; I am OK.
    <br>I just want to tell people watching me to focus their minds on God.
    <br>It is only God who can change everything – no one else except God.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We just want to hear a quick word from your mum as well.
    <br>What she has to say about your being here today to the glory of God.
    <br>Mamma, you are welcome.
    <br>Just introduce yourself to us.
    <br>My name is Amuda.
    <br>I thank God that through the help of Emmanuel TV, I have been able to locate my daughter, Biliki.
    <br>Biliki had disappeared for 11 years and I had no contact with her.
    <br>When I would go to church, they would tell me that she was still alive.
    <br>On Tuesday, I saw Biliki but she did not want to come to me.
    <br>She called on Abigail who beckoned on me but I asked Abigail to confirm it was Biliki.
    <br>As I was about to get up, Abigail shouted at Biliki, "Aunty Biliki!"
    <br>This caught everyone's attention and they gathered asking Biliki why she had treated her mum that way.
    <br>I thank God for delivering her for me.
    <br>Biliki asked for her father and I told her that he had died.
    <br>Our mother is saying that for 11 years she had not known where her daughter was.
    <br>She had no idea of her whereabouts.
    <br>After receiving her deliverance on Sunday,
    <br>she received news on Tuesday that someone was outside asking for her.
    <br>Upon coming out, she met with her daughter, who had come back to the house after 11 years of separation.
    <br>The mother is giving glory to God and thanking God
    <br> that Jesus Christ has delivered her daughter after so many years.
    <br>We give glory to God.
    <br>We want to encourage our sister that now she is delivered by Christ's Word,
    <br>she must be ruled by His Word in order to make this deliverance permanent.
    <br>We believe the best is yet to come, as you do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>After much counselling at SCOAN, Biliki and her mother are given financial support
    <br>to start a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>My name is Biliki.
    <br>I am 29 years old.
    <br>The woman beside me is my mum.
    <br>I want to thank God for what He has done in my life and for my deliverance.
    <br>I was here two Sundays ago.
    <br>During the mass prayer, God arrested me.
    <br>The evil spirit in me confessed and I received my deliverance.
    <br>Last week Sunday, I was here with my mum to testify of what God has done in my life.
    <br>Previously, I lived a miserable life of prostitution.
    <br>I travelled to two countries – Cotonou (Republic of Benin) and Cameroon.
    <br>I was based in Cameroon, working in a nightclub as a striptease dancer.
    <br>I was meeting men.
    <br>After living this life, I didn’t gain anything from it.
    <br>Nothing good came out of the money I made.
    <br>I had not seen my parents for seven years.
    <br>So, when my father died, I did not even know.
    <br>When I came here, I got my deliverance and the man of God asked me to come with my mum.
    <br>When I came with my mum, I shared my testimony.
    <br>I thank God that I am free now.
    <br>Since then, I have been OK.
    <br>I can read my Bible and pray.
    <br>So, I thank God for my life and for what God has done in my life - for my deliverance and breakthrough.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Indeed, we thank God Almighty for the wonderful deliverance you received.
    <br>Those who were following Emmanuel TV last two weeks will really understand
    <br>how mighty the deliverance was that God Almighty had done in your life
    <br>and bringing you back to your parents, whom you have lost contact with for so many years.
    <br>The life I was living was one of misery.
    <br>I would not wish for anyone to do the kind of things I was doing.
    <br>Most of my friends have died.
    <br>Some of them have sicknesses but I thank God that I came out alive,
    <br>safely and without injury or sickness.
    <br>I want to thank God.
    <br>To my girlfriends who are watching me now, I just want to give you this advice:
    <br>It is better that you come out from it so that God can deliver you the way He delivered me.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>My name is Amuda
    <br>What can you say about the deliverance in the life of your daughter?
    <br>You are back here with your daughter to thank God for the wonderful things He has done in your life.
    <br>What can you say about what God has done in the life of your daughter?
    <br>I thank God as I have seen my daughter who has come back home.
    <br>I thank God that she has changed; she reads the Bible and wants to start a new life now.
    <br>I thank God for T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>You have heard it from mamma.
    <br>Mamma says she is grateful to God Almighty for the deliverance in the life of her daughter.
    <br>Her daughter is a changed person now.
    <br>She can read the Bible, she can pray, she can meditate on the Word of God,
    <br>unlike before, when for so many years she didn't know where her daughter was.
    <br>She was separated from the daughter because of the past life she was living.
    <br>Now she is happy to have her daughter back.
    <br>Dear sister, we also have a message from the anointed man of God to you:
    <br>now, that you are delivered and you have decided to continue a new life that you have received
    <br>in Christ Jesus, the life of holiness, and forget totally your past life -
    <br>the man of God with the support of the Emmanuel TV partners wants to give you this financial support.
    <br>This is the sum of 200,000 Naira and a copy of 'The Mirror' book.

    <br>I know very soon that I will come back here with a big testimony, in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>Thank you very much for accepting this cash gift of 200,000 Naira given by the anointed man of God,
    <br>with the support of the Emmanuel TV partners and also 'The Mirror' book,
