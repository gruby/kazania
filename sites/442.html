    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In Jesus' Name at The SCOAN Prayer Line.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>What?
    <br>Leave her.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Leave her. That is simple.
    <br>Sometimes you make these demons proud.
    <br>Leave her.
    <br>The more they become wild and you then grab them, you encourage them to do more.
    <br>Where are you? Come out!
    <br>One, two!
    <br>Here!
    <br>One, two!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>One, two!
    <br>What?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In Jesus' Name at The SCOAN Prayer Line.
    <br>Is that not somebody who was ...?
    <br>What happened?
    <br>I was on the prayer line.
    <br>Go back to the prayer line.
    <br>You don't know what happened?
    <br>You touched me. Then, fire, everywhere.
    <br>You mean, I touched you?
    <br>I don't know but you touched me.
    <br>After touching you, what happened?
    <br>I saw fire, everywhere.
    <br>Fire everywhere?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So what happened to you and fire?
    <br>I was feeling very very hot.
    <br>Ok, listen to that.
    <br>If you are inside fire, you would not run?
    <br>That is why, everywhere, everywhere...
    <br>"You, T.B.Joshua, you are the one who put me inside the fire!"
    <br>So, where is the fire now?
    <br>No more fire.
    <br>How does the fire look like? Tell us. People want to listen.
    <br>It was like flames.
    <br>Ok, look at me.
    <br>After touching you, how does it come out?
    <br>I don't know; I saw some flames.
    <br>Ok. How did I touch you?
    <br>Just like this.
    <br>There was fire on you. I wanted to come near you but it was...
    <br>Can I touch you?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In Jesus' Name at The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>You need to know much about what is actually delivering you.
    <br>You need to know much about the power you are under.
    <br>You are under power.
    <br>You know the power but you still want to know more.
    <br>If you know much about the power you are under,
    <br>it is much better than just the deliverance and blessing you are receiving.
    <br>If you now receive that blessing, you would know how to keep it.
    <br>Ok, you are free.
    <br>You are free now.
    <br>What happened again? You were talking.
    <br>Ok, sit down and talk.
    <br>There was fire again upon me.
    <br>That's the fire that looses and also binds -
    <br>whatever that needs to be loosed in your body.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
