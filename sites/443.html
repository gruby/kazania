    443 - How To COUNSEL Yourself - TB JOSHUA
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Let's take that Word in the Book of John 16:33:
    <br>"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.
    <br>In this world you will have trouble."
    <br>Whatever name you call it - any foolish thing.
    <br>What are the things He has told us?
    <br>"In me you may have peace.
    <br>In this world you will have trouble."
    <br>It doesn't say "you may", it says "you will" - take note of that.
    <br>What is trouble?
    <br>Just think of anything foolish.
    <br>Let's take it further.
    <br>"But take heart! I have overcome the world."
    <br>While under sickness and hardship, satan wants you to be sad.
    <br>He wants you to curse God.
    <br>He wants you to lament and complain.
    <br>You know when you are...
    <br>At the same time you cannot expect God to be with you, while you are sad.
    <br>This is what satan wants - to separate you from your Creator;
    <br>to overthrow you from your position
    <br>but those who bless God in their trouble prove their sonship.
    <br>Even the Bible says,
    <br>when things seem not alright with you, honour Him,
    <br>and He promised to honour those who honour Him.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>He promised to bless those who bless Him
    <br>when certain things seem not alright.
    <br>Like when you are sick, business is not going well, or bad news -
    <br>at that moment you bless Him -
    <br>He promised to bless you greatly.
    <br>When you wait till that trouble is over to bless Him,
    <br>you don't prove your sonship.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>For your heart to...
    <br>...it is not possible.
    <br>If you wait to bless God when your trouble is over, you don't prove your sonship.
    <br>These are the challenges we are having.
    <br>Some would say, "When I get the contract, I will come and give testimony".
    <br>It means you are waiting till you get the contract, before coming for testimony.
    <br>Testimony means blessing, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>When we commit a certain matter to our Lord, Jesus Christ,
    <br>our attitude towards that matter should change greatly.
    <br>It should prove that really we committed the matter to God.
    <br>You say, "I have pain here, in Jesus' name".
    <br>From that moment your attitude would prove that you really have committed the matter to God.
    <br>"I have pain here. I'm going to doctor for treatment."
    <br>After seeing the doctor, your attitude should also show that you have seen the doctor,
    <br>compared to when you see Jesus.
    <br>Like the text we just read, it says,
    <br>"I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.
    <br>In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."
    <br>Who told you that when you become a Christian, you would not face challenges?
    <br>Where did you read it in the Bible that when you become a Christian you would not fall sick?
    <br>Where did you read it that when you become a Christian
    <br>your business would not go up and down,
    <br>that when you become a Christian something will not punch you, hit you?
    <br>Who told you this?
    <br>This is why Jesus said to you, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>If there would be no challenges, Jesus would not say that.
    <br>If there wouldn't be what?
    <br>He has prophesied this, "Walking with Me - there would be challenges.
    <br>I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>It means there will be something that would test your faith,
    <br>your movement with Him and your journey with Him.
    <br>Something would try to stop you, discourage you.
    <br>He said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>Because you believe so much that once you become a Christian,
    <br>no sickness, no disease, no trouble, no attack, no this, no that - that is your belief.
    <br>Now, there is an attack - "Am I a Christian? Why is this happening to me?"
    <br>You allow your situation to rule you.
    <br>Your situation will tell you whether you are a Christian or not.
    <br>"In me you will have peace.
    <br>But in the world you will have tribulation.
    <br>Cheer up. I have overcome."
    <br>That means your tribulations cannot stop you - that is what the Bible is saying.
    <br>If you are a Christian, your tribulation cannot stop you but rather, improve you.
    <br>Your sickness cannot impair you but improve you - that is what the Bible is saying.
    <br>In what way?
    <br>Sometimes our situation may not improve us financially but spiritually.
    <br>Sometimes you say, "My business is collapsing and I'm a Christian".
    <br>But what you derive from that situation, you are becoming stronger in your spiritual life.
    <br>That business may remain worst but what will come out of if -
    <br>you become stronger in your Christian life.
    <br>Sometimes, being a Christian, when your business is collapsing,
    <br>you are expecting that business to go up but it may not.
    <br>It may be your spiritual life that the Lord wants to strengthen.
    <br>When the Lord knows that your spiritual life is zero,
    <br>and you cannot walk with Him;
    <br>God is Spirit and His worshipers must do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>When you are a zero in your spiritual life, you cannot walk with the Lord.
    <br>And if you are a stakeholder in the Kingdom,
    <br>there is a need to stop you in order to strengthen your desire for Him.
    <br>When the Lord knows you are a candidate of Heaven,
    <br>and suddenly you are going astray, death could stop you,
    <br>so that you will not lose the Kingdom.
    <br>Sometimes death is a blessing and miracle.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you see people dying, you say...
    <br>You don't know they are in the Kingdom of God, because God knows
    <br>that a step would take them to satan
    <br>and they are not destined for hell but the Kingdom of God.
    <br>Death could do the job;
    <br>take them back home where they belong.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The devil wants you to curse God while under situation.
    <br>How do you curse God?
    <br>When you begin to murmur...
    <br>You know - you are cursing God.
    <br>But those who honour Him in trouble prove their sonship,
    <br>"Yes. Nothing can separate me from God!"
    <br>That is your logo, that is my logo;
    <br>if truly you are a Christian, nothing can separate you.
    <br>But if you are not a Christian and you pretend;
    <br>you confess to be a Christian but you are not such in heart -
    <br>anything can stop you.
    <br>If truly you are a Christian and you are such in heart, nothing can stop you.
    <br>Sickness cannot stop you.
    <br>Affliction cannot stop you.
    <br>Our relationship with God is beyond the grave.
    <br>Therefore, this is how you know a Christian - such in heart.
    <br>True Christians don't allow their situation to rule them.
    <br>They know that in our walking with the Lord, there are good and hard times.
    <br>You are walking with Him as a Christian;
    <br>good times will come and sometimes difficult times will come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you can prove your sonship in good times, you should do so in hard times.
    <br>"I'm a Christian" in good times, when the money is in the pocket,
    <br>I should be able to stand to say "I'm a Christian" when the money is not in the pocket.
    <br>"I'm a Christian" when the food is on the table,
    <br>but when the food is not on the table, I should be able to say the same and be happy.
    <br>You have to honour God before men.
    <br>If you can honour God before men when there is food on the table,
    <br>you should also honour Him before men when food is not on the table.
    <br>You honour Him when you have good health and shout, "Hallelujah!"
    <br>You let people know, "I'm a Christian".
    <br>You should also honour Him when there is pain in your flesh
    <br>because you may be sick and not because of sin...
    <br>Nothing can separate me from the love of God.
    <br>You have to judge yourself if you are a Christian,
    <br>when you are facing hardship, difficulties, hard situation, rare situation -
    <br>then you will know if you are a Christian.
    <br>What we are saying is that
    <br>even when everything seems not alright, believe Him.
    <br>He promised to bless you mightily.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you stop being a Christian, that cannot remove Him from the throne.
    <br>He is what He says He is.
    <br>He can do what He says He can do.
    <br>We give tests to God.
    <br>You say, "God, if You bless me, I will come and give tithes, I will build the church" -
    <br>this is a test to God.
    <br>This is why it is difficult for us to establish the relationship we are talking about.
    <br>You keep giving tests to God...
    <br>The number of years you have been a Christian, "Look at what I am, what I have achieved".
    <br>Comparing yourself to others - no!
    <br>Christianity has no alternative.
    <br>Our faith has no alternative.
    <br>It is either you have faith in Him, or not.
    <br>It is not an issue of first and second choice.
    <br>"If I don't belong to this party, I will join another party."
    <br>No. It is either you have faith in Him, or not.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We that have faith enter into the rest.
    <br>If you believe, you enter into the rest.
    <br>"Hallelujah! I am healed."
    <br>- "It is finished?"
    <br>- "Yes. It is finished."
    <br>We don't look back, we just believe.
    <br>If you believe a house is on fire, you would not stay there.
    <br>If you stay there, it means you do not believe the house is on fire.
    <br>They say, "This house is on fire".
    <br>You now enter and sit down and stay there -
    <br>it means you do not believe the house is on fire.
    <br>That is our belief.
    <br>People claim to be Christians - they fashion out alternatives.
    <br>Alternative to faith is religion,
    <br>where we are coming from.
    <br>You know, you are coming from religious background.
    <br>That is an alternative.
    <br>I want you to think over this once again.
    <br>If truly you are a Christian, we know during your hard, difficult times.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If truly you are a Christian, we know when you are sick.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If truly you are a Christian, we know when everything seems not alright.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because the Bible says:
    <br>"In me you have peace, but in this world you will have tribulation.
    <br>Cheer up. I have overcome."
    <br>You allow your situation to ground you; many have been grounded.
    <br>A lot of situations you are facing because the way you look at it:
    <br>as if you are not a Christian - that is why you have situation.
    <br>As if God hates you - that is why you have this situation.
    <br>As if you have no faith - that is why you have the situation.
    <br>And the moment you look at it, "I'm not a Christian, that's why I have this situation" -
    <br>indeed, you are not a Christian at that moment.
    <br>That your confession will rubbish your Christian life.
    <br>"I have no faith, that is why I have these challenges" -
    <br>indeed, you have no faith.
    <br>So, your situation has grounded you, rubbished you and turned you into a common man,
    <br>whereas, as a Christian, you are not a common man,
    <br>you are a supernatural man.
    <br>And a supernatural man is greater than the richest man in the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A common man is someone who does not know where he is going, where he is coming from.
    <br>How many of you know you will get back home?
    <br>You just guess, "I will get back home".
    <br>That is a common man.
    <br>Supernatural man knows he will get back home,
    <br>knows where he is coming from,
    <br>knows what will happen next.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see what your situation has turned into?
    <br>It has turned into that.
    <br>That is why when you have a situation, you start crying,
    <br>you think that is the end of you.
    <br>Or, when the medical doctor gives you a report, "Look, get your will done".
    <br>You start running "helter-skelter" everywhere.
    <br>Or, when a kidnapper sends a note to you, "Get ready. We are coming to kill you".
    <br>You start running everywhere...
    <br>We don't know what will happen next.
    <br>What kind of life is this?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is what your situation has turned into.
    <br>You just believe that once you have a situation, you are not a Christian, you are not a child of God,
    <br>you are not with God, God is not with you, as a result of your sin, that is why you have this trouble,
    <br>this and that - you begin to rubbish yourself -
    <br>at that moment you belong to satan.
    <br>That is the confession satan wants you to give.
    <br>You begin to count the time you have been a Christian,
    <br>"I have been a Christian for the past ten years. I go to church regularly.
    <br>I read my Bible. I listen to the man of God..."
    <br>This is what satan wants you to confess.
    <br>And you don't know that your situation is not like others'.
    <br>Others - their situation - as a result of their sin,
    <br>but your situation is to prepare you to strengthen your desire.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My situation - to strengthen my desire and determination for God".
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again,
    <br>"My situation is not like others'.
    <br>Others' are as a result of their sin.
    <br>My situation - to strengthen my desire and determination for God".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If your colleague out there falls sick, has cancer,
    <br>and suddenly you too go to the doctor and you are also diagnosed with cancer -
    <br>your cancer is different from your friend's cancer.
    <br>Your friend's cancer may be as a result of sin,
    <br>which would end in death, destruction.
    <br>But your cancer - to pray the more, fast the more, see the need for God the more.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And if indeed you die, Heaven is your reward.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That cancer - probably God is using it to change your direction,
    <br>so that you will not lose the Kingdom of God.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Oftentimes, God uses foolish things to communicate.
    <br>Let me give you a good example.
    <br>You may be going to work;
    <br>if God does not want you to go to that work because of a danger waiting for you at that work,
    <br>you may suddenly see a python on the road.
    <br>While you were going, you saw a python and the python would start chasing you.
    <br>By the time you have run far, it will leave you.
    <br>Then you say, "No, I can't go to that work again".
    <br>They would say, "You have to come, there is no python on the road" -
    <br>"No, I'm seeing it with my eyes. I'm seeing it in my brain."
    <br>When you get home, your heart would be beating like this, until that day is over.
    <br>The following morning you say, "I can go to work now".
    <br>You may not pass that place; you may pass another place.
    <br>At the moment when the python is chasing you, you would not think of any other road.
    <br>Snake is a foolish thing.
    <br>Or, suddenly you wake up in the morning...
    <br>Because God wants to stop you from going somewhere,
    <br>you suddenly develop a serious headache and they will rush you to the hospital.
    <br>You will not even know when you get to the hospital.
    <br>The doctor would be on you for six hours -
    <br>you open your eyes and say, "What happened?"
    <br>They say, "You are sick. The work is over".
    <br>That is that work God doesn't want you to go to.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Oftentimes, God uses foolish things to express, communicate and talk to you.
    <br>God has been talking to many of you - you don't know about this.
    <br>You want God to use bread and water to talk to you.
    <br>You want God to use pounds, dollars and naira to speak to you.
    <br>Any voice that is not as good as dollars, pounds - you are not interested in that voice.
    <br>OK, speak to yourself.
    <br>Great men you know today - they were once staff, workers in the companies.
    <br>Ninety-nine percent were sacked.
    <br>It is either they sacked them, or they lied against them
    <br>and they took them to a tribunal or court.
    <br>But today, some of them are the richest in the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The ministry you are in today - you don't know where the ministry is coming from.
    <br>This is sixth ministry.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fire, storm, water destroying the ministry
    <br>and this is ministry number six.
    <br>Not branch.
    <br>I mean the first ministry was destroyed by this,
    <br>the second ministry was destroyed by this,
    <br>third ministry was destroyed, fifth ministry was destroyed - this is sixth.
    <br>It is not they were branches.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I were you, I would have become a businessman today or contractor.
    <br>What happened to your former business?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because of a little disappointment, you abandoned the job.
    <br>You are doing another one, where you would have no disappointment.
    <br>In which business would you have no disappointments?
    <br>Tell me the business where you would not have failure.
    <br>Tell me the business that would not have challenges.
    <br>Tell me; that man you will marry
    <br>that the whole thing would work smoothly just like that.
    <br>Assume, you asked God for opinion before your first marriage -
    <br>I can't imagine what would have happened to you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>In every situation, God has something to say.
    <br>When you see "bad", ask God what does this "bad" mean,
    <br>because God can use this "bad" to communicate.
    <br>But you never ask God what He has to say.
    <br>You just look at that situation from "face value".
    <br>Assume you took your time to look at everything that has come your way
    <br>right from the beginning of your life -
    <br>today, I'm just thinking where you would have been.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>"Assume you had taken your time to look at everything that has come your way
    <br>from the beginning of your life -
    <br>I'm thinking where you would have been."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I wasn't talking to you now;
    <br>you want to abandon the business because of the trouble you are facing.
    <br>Before you abandon it, ask God.
    <br>Don't let your situation rule you, dictate the direction.
    <br>Situation should not dictate the direction.
    <br>If I wasn't saying this, you were about to abandon your marriage,
    <br>because of the situation that is happening in the marriage.
    <br>Before you abandon that marriage, ask God.
    <br>Don't let whatever situation;
    <br>either dishonesty, unfaithfulness, whatever you call it -
    <br>don't let it rule you or dictate the direction.
    <br>Ask God what He has to say about this situation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I look at my life from the beginning -
    <br>I don't see anything that I have abandoned,
    <br>unless you abandon me, I don't abandon people.
    <br>If I leave you because of your weakness, I will lose your strength.
    <br>If I do away with you because you are a liar - I say, "This man is a liar"...
    <br>Come.
    <br>I'm a friend to this man but I discover he is a liar.
    <br>If I now say, "This man is a liar; he has lied against me. No, I don't want to see him again." -
    <br>I have rejected his strength, and his strength can bless my life.
    <br>If you are looking at someone's weakness, look also at his strength.
    <br>Every man has weakness and strength.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If this man is very greedy;
    <br>he cannot do away with anything, "Give me" - he wants my money all the time,
    <br>I realize that he is too greedy and say, "I don't want to see him."
    <br>If I reject this man because of his greediness, what of his strength?
    <br>I reject the strength too.
    <br>His strength may be a blessing to me tomorrow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is life.
    <br>You have abandoned someone who would have blessed you.
    <br>Are you talking of husband and wife, business partner?
    <br>You are looking for a perfect man, woman, business partner...
    <br>You will get to Heaven...
    <br>Sit down.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You will get to Heaven".
    <br>You are looking for a perfect man?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>Perfect woman?
    <br>Business man?
    <br>Woman?
    <br>You will get to Heaven.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are because I am; I am because you are.
    <br>Where you are weak, I am strong; where I am weak, you are strong.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want you to counsel yourself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Counsel yourself".
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>It means, speak to yourself.
    <br>You speak to people, you counsel people;
    <br>you don't know that you also need to counsel yourself.
    <br>That is the problem we have.
    <br>You are good in counselling people;
    <br>when you see people crying, you say, "Don't worry.
    <br>As a Christian you have to do this or that".
    <br>You do counsel people but you are not used to counsel yourself.
    <br>You should have time to counsel yourself.
    <br>Speak to yourself.
    <br>You can deliver yourself.
    <br>Self-deliverance!
    <br>You can heal yourself.
    <br>Self-healing!
    <br>You can bless yourself.
    <br>Self-blessing!
    <br>By now, you would have got over all this nonsense,
    <br>assuming you did counsel yourself.
    <br>Sit down at home, close and lock your door and begin to counsel yourself.
    <br>Talk to yourself, "Look at what the man of God said today in the church.
    <br>All this trouble that I used to think about; I'm lonely, I have no money, this, that...
    <br>All this, as a Christian, does not mean it is as a result of my sin
    <br>but it is meant to strengthen my desire and determination for God.
    <br>It means I should pray the more, see the need for God the more.
    <br>I'm still a Christian.
    <br>All this trouble - God still loves me with all this trouble.
    <br>Glory be to God; I should bless God".
    <br>When you do that, you laugh.
    <br>Did you use to laugh alone?
    <br>How many of us used to laugh when we are alone?
    <br>But you cry alone.
    <br>It is a common thing.
    <br>You just sit down and cry.
    <br>When your children enter the room, they say, "What happened, mummy?"
    <br>"No, no problem."
    <br>You should learn to laugh, to smile alone.
    <br>While you are alone, you just smile,
    <br>"Thank You, Lord".
    <br>You can never do that when you are not counseling yourself -
    <br>it is an outcome of counseling that brings out crying and laughing.
    <br>I laugh.
    <br>When I needed to cry, I cried.
    <br>You have to do that - that will get you out of this mess.
    <br>It will give a great relief.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The outcome of counseling may lead to laughing or crying.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The outcome of counseling may lead to laughing or crying.]
    <br>These are Christian lives.
    <br>When you know you have God, you have majority with you.
    <br>You with God are majority.
    <br>When you develop this habit,
    <br>before you know it, you hear the presence of God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why I gave you these faith bracelets.
    <br>This is why.
    <br>Bring your camera, please, brother.
    <br>I want to show you two brothers; just sit like that.
    <br>The brother here - can you see?
    <br>Record this brother; this is for fashion.
    <br>This is also for fashion.
    <br>Brother, what are you saying?
    <br>While I am ministering to the people, you keep firing on.
    <br>I was looking at you.
    <br>While I was looking at you, my heart was connecting with you.
    <br>What are you saying - please, tell me.
    <br>There is no way we could know what you are saying,
    <br>when you are talking to God and God is talking to you.
    <br>You are not talking to men.
    <br>What are you saying?
    <br>I'm saying, "Take more of me, give me more of You, Holy Spirit.
    <br>Let Your anointing fall on me" - that's what I'm saying.
    <br>When did you start this?
    <br>I started it when you started preaching.
    <br>Why can't you let this be a habit all the time,
    <br>even when you are talking to your colleague?
    <br>Are you ashamed?
    <br>No.
    <br>Let this be a habit.
    <br>When it turns to be your habit, seven days seven nights.
    <br>Continue it even while eating - then you cannot take it in your hand to do it.
    <br>In the office, everywhere.
    <br>Do you know what will start happening to you?
    <br>When you drop it for a second, your heart will continue to say the same thing.
    <br>People that have hypertension know what I'm talking about -
    <br>you will feel the blood moving in your body.
    <br>Your blood will be going up.
    <br>Those who have heart attack...
    <br>In the same vein, you will hear that voice in your heart, "Take more of me..." without this.
    <br>You just hear that voice in your heart,
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>Our heart is a place where you can register what you want.
    <br>You can change, delete it tomorrow and register another thing.
    <br>You have not been praying from your heart -
    <br>that is why you don't know what prayer is all about.
    <br>All the prayer you are offering is just from the mouth, it is not from your heart.
    <br>If the prayer was from your heart, you would pray all the time.
    <br>Prayer from the heart - all the time.
    <br>Prayer from the mouth - occasionally, when there is a need, trouble, situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Prayer from the heart - all the time;
    <br>from the mouth - when the need arises".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A break in prayer is a break in God.
    <br>There is no time we don't need God - we need God 24/7.
    <br>Any moment from now, you will see me praying for almost 2000 people.
    <br>If I do pray the way you pray, for every person I pray for I would say,
    <br>"Be healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Be delivered, in Jesus' name!" - for 2000 people; I would die there.
    <br>My flesh would not be able to carry it.
    <br>How can I shout to 2000 people, "Be delivered, in Jesus' name! In Jesus' name I pray!
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name!" ?
    <br>And I keep saying it to 2000 people...
    <br>My blood would complain.
    <br>That is why they say the flesh cannot do the job but the Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But if that "Be healed, in Jesus' name. Be delivered, in Jesus' name" is in my heart already,
    <br>I would just be stretching hand.
    <br>It is the hand that is "radiating" that - see me.
    <br>And I can use my mouth to do other things.
    <br>While praying for this man, I can be...
    <br>I would do another thing while doing this.
    <br>The medium you are using to relate with God
    <br>is different from the medium you are using to talk to people.
    <br>But if I now say, "Be healed, in Jesus' name!",
    <br>will I say to this man, "Come. Be healed, in Jesus' name"?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How would I share my mouth?
    <br>I cannot share my mouth.
    <br>As you see me, while I'm praying for people, I still talk to the ushers, to people.
    <br>Because it is not the same medium.
    <br>Different medium I use to talk to God and different medium I can use to talk to you.
    <br>Talking to God will not stop me from doing things of the flesh like eating, talking to people...
    <br>Things on the outside.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Prayer from the heart is prayer that relies on God's strength, assistance.
    <br>Our heart is the communication point.
    <br>So, please - your faith bracelet;
    <br>don't bother about the beauty of it.
    <br>It is an instrument to register the voice in your heart.
    <br>You may choose not to wear it; it is an instrument to count your faith.
    <br>After finishing to count your faith, you may decide to put it in your pocket.
    <br>All the time you count your faith, but sometimes you may want to do something.
    <br>Put it in your pocket, bring it out - you may choose not to wear it.
    <br>We do it so you may wear it; if you cannot wear it, it's OK.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I would be very happy if somebody could come out to summarize the lesson you learned
    <br>from all we talked about.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Our daddy in the Lord taught us that being a Christian you can be sick and still be a friend of God.
    <br>The fact that you meet various situations in your life,
    <br>does not equate you to unbelievers.
    <br>They may face similar situations as a result of sin;
    <br>yours is not as a result of sin.
    <br>Therefore, Christ is saying that, "In Me you will have peace,
    <br>but in the world, in which we live, we will have tribulation".
    <br>We should rest assured that He has overcome the world.
    <br>So, in times of all these difficult times, we should understand that they are bound to come.
    <br>Being a Christian doesn't mean you will not fall sick, you will not meet challenges;
    <br>no, Christian life is not like that.
    <br>It is full of climbing and descending.
    <br>Therefore, when you meet these challenges, believe in God.
    <br>Even if it leads you to death, God has allowed it to come and rest with Him.
    <br>Therefore we should be assured that no matter the challenges, God is with us.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>Thank you very much - clap for him.
    <br>Wow!
    <br>And I know our women there want to come out.
    <br>OK, come on; thank you.
    <br>Thank you, pastor.
    <br>From what I learned today...
    <br>When the man of God was teaching, it was like he was talking directly to me.
    <br>In me - I faced a lot of tribulations.
    <br>It was like everything was just talking to me.
    <br>I said, "God, wow!"
    <br>I have known where all my problems were coming from.
    <br>As I go home, I'm going to practise to learn how to counsel myself.
    <br>And I know that with the help of the Holy Spirit, He is going to perfect it.
    <br>I believe God has touched all us in different ways.
    <br>Thank you, daddy.
    <br>And I'm very happy that you used yourself as a good example.
    <br>How do you want to counsel yourself?
    <br>Tell us - we want to learn too.
    <br>You say when you get home, you want to counsel yourself.
    <br>Go ahead - tell us how you want to start this counselling.
    <br>When I reach home after the service, I'm going to sit down and lock the door.
    <br>I can remember last year when I lost my husband - I went through a lot of things.
    <br>At the time, I was like, "God, what is happening? I don't really know".
    <br>As I go home, I'm going to counsel myself, tell God, "Give me that heart to forget some things,
    <br>so I can look forward because at times it seems as if all hope is gone".
    <br>As I'm going now, I'm going to counsel myself.
    <br>And I know that with the help of God, there must be a way out.
    <br>Come on, take a fruit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't bother, you may carry a big one - I will help you to carry it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>You see - as big as it is, so big is your joy.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Where is uncle? Please, take your fruit.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You may be seated.
