    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On the 24th of September 2017, during a live Sunday service,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied concerning disastrous storms ganging up in the sea,
    <br>adding that a part of Africa would also be affected.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>There is disaster - bad nature, storms from the sea.
    <br>I said they are ganging up in the sea.
    <br>I said this will move from one country to another.
    <br>I said it.
    <br>It is not yet over because even in Africa,
    <br>a part of Africa - I am seeing this will move there.
