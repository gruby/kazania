  <p>    
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Power of deliverance!
    <br>Release your children!
    <br>Do it again, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever spirit in their blood, fluid, tendons, bones, kidney, liver,
    <br>whatever spirit attacking their body - Holy Ghost!
    <br>Camera, move around!
    <br>There's a woman in a pool of blood.
    <br>Please camera, move, capture the woman!
    <br>Following the prophecy, the SCOAN team move around the church
    <br>to locate the lady whom the Spirit of God described as sitting in a pool of blood.
    <br>Surely the lady is found!
    <br>Watch your screen, see what is happening in perfect description of what the man of God said earlier on
    <br>that there's a woman in a pool of blood and this is the blood of affliction.
    <br>Watch your screen right now, she is at the lady's.
    <br>Can you see, if such blood forced itself to come out, you would have fainted.
    <br>The nurse should be there to rescue her.
    <br>That is the fibroid that she has been carrying that needed to be operated - burst out!

    <br>They should quickly help her to recover. The nurse should be there to rescue her.
    <br>More are still coming because it's triple fibroid.
    <br>And it will come out all throughout today, tomorrow.
    <br>They need to rescue her, help her, please nurse.
    <br>Fibroids Burst During The Mass Prayer
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good Morning, Emmanuel! (God is with us - Mathew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Lehlohonolo Matany from South Africa, Florida.
    <br>I am a bank fraud analyst by profession.
    <br>Five years ago, I went to the gynecologist because I was experiencing pains in my lower abdomen
    <br>and they diagnosed me with fibroids.
    <br>This thing affected my career, it affected my marriage.
    <br>I used to take leaves, sometimes I would stay out of work for a long time.
    <br>In 2015, I was hospitalized and they did blood transfusion because I lost a lot of blood.
    <br>I used to experience pains, I couldn't do my chores at home, every time I was sad at home - I was not happy.
    <br>I went to different gynaecologists for different opinions.
    <br>And also, I went to different churches in different countries - but I didn't get any help.
    <br>Then my husband had a dream of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He saw someone telling him that I must come here, that is where I would get my deliverance.
    <br>That person told him that when I get here, I will receive my complete healing.
    <br>We kept on delaying because of finances because these fibroids, my health affected my finances.
    <br>I was in so much debt, every month when I drew up my budget, I always included medication and doctors.
    <br>It was so hard, people of God.
    <br>But by the grace of God, we applied to come to The SCOAN, we were approved to come in.
    <br>Last Sunday I was here in church when the man of God Prophet T.B Joshua prayed.
    <br>He did the mass prayer and he started praying and shouting: "In your blood!" as you heard in the video.
    <br>He started shouting: "In your blood!", I felt something coming out, then I rushed to the bathroom.
    <br>I didn't tell anyone, I just rushed to the bathroom.
    <br>While I was standing there in the queue to go in, the Prophet said:
    <br>"There is a woman, ushers, please help this woman. She is in a pool of blood."
    <br>And then I saw cameras coming in and evangelists coming in.
    <br>Then the fibroids fell, they just fell on the floor.

    <br>Prayer/Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So I was wondering what was falling.
    <br>When I looked down, I saw some things on the floor with the blood.
    <br>It was indeed the pool of blood because I was bleeding so much,
    <br>and I don't know what pushed them to come out, to fall on the floor
    <br>but I believe it was the Holy Spirit, the works of God.
    <br>Mrs. Lehlohonolo Matany 
    <br>Prayer/Prophecy Testimony
    <br>To confirm the word of the man of God that says that this fibroid is going to come out for a few days more -
    <br>can you tell us, how many days that you experienced this fibroid falling off from that Sunday?
    <br>It was on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday I experienced these fibroids coming out.
    <br>Mrs. Lehlohonolo Matany
    <br>Prayer/Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Does it mean, before the man of God started praying, you were under your menstruation -
    <br>were you ever seeing blood even before the prayer started?
    <br>Before I came to the church I was not experiencing any blood.
    <br>The blood started, when the man of God started saying: "In your blood, that sickness in your blood!" -
    <br>the blood started coming out, that's when I experienced the blood.
    <br>Mrs. Lehlohonolo Matany 
    <br>Prayer/Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Right now I can press my stomach, it is soft - it was hard.
    <br>I could feel fibroids, I could feel them here but now I can press my stomach,
    <br>I am not feeling dizzy anymore, I used to feel dizzy and very weak.
    <br>But now I have strength, my stomach is soft, I can press my stomach.
    <br>Mrs. Lehlohonolo Matany 
    <br>Prayer/Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My word of advice to people all over the world is: Stay in the Word of God, don't depart from the Word of God.
    <br>The Word of God says you are healed by His stripes, do not change your confession because of pain.
    <br>When you are feeling pain do not change your confession, keep on saying "I am healed"
    <br>and God will rescue you, He will never leave you, nor forsake you.
    <br>Do not run away from God, run to God in every situation.
    <br>Mrs. Lehlohonolo Matany 
    <br>Prayer/Prophecy Testimony
