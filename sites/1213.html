  <p>    
    <br>Thank you
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Viewers, we salute your faith, your time.
    <br>Thank you for your patience.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Today we shall talk about building God's character.
    <br>There is so much fear.
    <br>It is not even situations that kill now; 
    <br>it is fear of the situation.
    <br>Everywhere; even the politics today - fear.
    <br>Some decided not to be a politician because of fear.
    <br>People just don't know what to do.
    <br>The business too - fear.
    <br>Everything - fear, fear...
    <br>Fear of loss, fear of failure, 
    <br>fear of sickness and disease,
    <br>fear of accusation, fear of today’s politics, even fear of yourself – you are afraid of yourself.
    <br>Some people before going to sleep, they call their children saying, "Come, This is where I put the money,
    <br>This is where the bank account is,
    <br> I have some money with these people,"
    <br>but he is afraid he may not wake up.
    <br>Because of what we are seeing all over the world; 
    <br>even among friends - a lot, a lot...
    <br>Let's talk about building God's character.
    <br>This will take us to some texts in the Bible.
    <br>We take first text from the Book of 
    <br>John 16, from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>Actually, the proof text there is verse 33.
    <br>When we leave the Book of John 16, 
    <br>we will have the grace to look at the Book of Isaiah 43.
    <br>Take your reading from verse 1 to the end;
    <br>that will give you a picture of what we are talking about.
    <br>Also, the Book of Psalms will help.
    <br>Take your reading from verse 4 to 7.
    <br>Also, the Book of Philippians, chapter 4; take your reading from verse 6 to 7.
    <br>That will do.
    <br>In all - the Book of Joshua, chapter 1, verse 8.
    <br>I want to read that Book of John.
    <br>When you get home, you have those other Books to read.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>John 16:
    <br>“All this I have told you so that you will not fall away.
    <br>They will put you out of the synagogue;
    <br>in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God."
    <br>That is the right to kill you...
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>“They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.
    <br>I have told you this, so that when their time comes
    <br>you will remember that I warned you about them.
    <br>I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you.”
    <br>Because He was with us, He did not...
    <br>Let's go to the verse 33.
    <br>“I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace.
    <br>In this world you will have tribulation. 
    <br>But take heart! I have overcome the world.”
    <br>That will just give us the basis of what we are to talk about.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Don't forget that Book of Isaiah;
    <br>Isaiah 43 from beginning to the end - that will really help you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Jesus wants to be involved in our lives as mothers.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>That is why He is giving all these warnings and all we are reading about.
    <br>He wants to be involved in our lives as mothers.
    <br>You know mothers?
    <br>Compared to fathers.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>He knows there will be times fear will overwhelm us.
    <br>This is why He said, “I pray your faith will not fail”.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>He knows there will be times fear will overwhelm us.
    <br>That is why He said to His disciples, "I pray your faith..." -
    <br>it means something is coming.
    <br>You will begin to say, "Will I be a Christian? Will I pray?"
    <br>This is what we are seeing now all over.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you seeing them now?
    <br>His prophecy is coming to reality.
    <br>You are free...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fear of loss,
    <br>fear of failure,
    <br>fear of false accusation,
    <br>fear of sickness, disease and infirmity,
    <br>fear of today’s business and politics -
    <br>fear, fear, fear...
    <br>Because of that, your focus has changed.
    <br>Fear changes focus.
    <br>Businessman becomes pastor today, and turns to...
    <br>Fear changes focus.
    <br>Fear is a more deceptive enemy than satan himself.
    <br>More what?
    <br>... than satan himself.
    <br>Situation doesn’t kill but fear kills.
    <br>Sickness doesn’t kill but fear kills.
    <br>Before that sickness - a medical report, "Prepare your will" - already you have died...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Fear is a more deceptive enemy than satan.
    <br>Many people - they hold on to themselves.
    <br>Fear stops us from admitting our guilt.
    <br>"No. If I said this, what would happen to me?"
    <br>Fear stops us from admitting our guilt.
    <br>Look at our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is the One that sustained Him in the Garden of Gethsemane
    <br>when He prayed concerning the cup of suffering.
    <br>Holy Spirit sustained Him.
    <br>"Oh, let this cup pass over."
    <br>The Holy Spirit said to Him, "Don't forget the reason why you are sent.
    <br>You are not sent to do Your will, but the will of Father in Heaven.
    <br>Oh, let the will of God be done."
    <br>It was the Holy Spirit that sustained Him.
    <br>Fear, fear, fear - you are even afraid of yourself.
    <br>Fear of your children, fear of yourself, fear of your husband, fear of your wife...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You see suicides today.
    <br>People commit suicide because of fear.
    <br>The rate of suicides is crazy!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why we have to build God's character.
    <br>The funny thing is that
    <br>not even our natural gifts, talent, education can help us to overcome fear
    <br>but they can only develop and refine us as a natural man to the highest possible point.
    <br>That is what education and talent can do; 
    <br>to the highest possible point,
    <br>but cannot sustain you, cannot help you to overcome fear; of sickness, of this of that.
    <br>You see many people commit suicide today.
    <br>Let someone say, "fear".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Some are here today not because of Jesus,
    <br> but because of their boss, mentor, girlfriend, boyfriend;
    <br>that is the reason why they are here.
    <br>Not that they have faith.
    <br>Fear.
    <br>Our concern now is to build God’s character.
    <br>If you want to become God’s person, a Christian, 
    <br>born again, you must follow His process.
    <br>God’s Word reflects His character.
    <br>To build God’s character, to become 
    <br>God’s person, to become a Christian,
    <br>to become born again, you must follow His process.
    <br>Let someone say, "His process".
    <br>You understand that?
    <br>Like women have taken over jeans, 
    <br>we have taken the soup in the kitchen.
    <br>They are the ones putting on jeans now.
    <br>Before you know it, the jeans are in the market; trousers -
    <br>you see them putting on, they have taken over from us.
    <br>In fact, we are ready to wear skirts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>They should prepare; fashion 
    <br>designers should get us skirts.
    <br>If they have taken over this; the trousers and jeans - everywhere jeans, trousers... women.
    <br>We are protesting, so let us also start wearing skirts.
    <br>So they will know that we are protesting.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know, a processing is like making a soup; 
    <br>they put things together.
    <br>If one thing is missing, you miss it all.
    <br>That is why when you taste s pepper soup,
    <br> you say, "What is this?"
    <br>It is because something is missing.
    <br>You forgot to add something and you start drinking a pepper soup, but it is sweet.
    <br>It is processing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is God's processing?
    <br>Apart from the Bible texts given to you, 
    <br>when you look at the Book of John 3:5 -
    <br>if you are not born of the Spirit, you are not born again.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a Christian.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a believer.
    <br>Because God is Spirit and His worshipers 
    <br>must worship Him in Spirit and truth.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>You must follow Him in Spirit.
    <br>You must talk to Him in Spirit.
    <br>You must relate with Him in Spirit.
    <br>If you are not born of Spirit, that is John 3:5, you are not.
    <br>And the Book of Romans 8:9-10 says,
    <br>“If you don’t have the Spirit of God, 
    <br>you don’t belong to Him.”
    <br>How do we belong to Him?
    <br>God’s Word reflects His character.
    <br>Since God’s Word reflects His character, 
    <br>where God speaks, power speaks.
    <br>When God walks, power walks.
    <br>When God waves, power waves.
    <br>When God greets, power greets.
    <br>When God talks, power talks.
    <br>God's power is working through His Word and His Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "God's power is 
    <br>working through His Word and His Spirit".
    <br>This is how He walks.
    <br>God - power; God talks - power talks.
    <br>When you say God, you say power.
    <br>Say, "God - power"
    <br>That is God for you.
    <br>It is like a tap.
    <br>You want water somewhere, you just have to turn the tap, and the water will come through the tap.
    <br>Through what?
    <br>Tap.
    <br>He works through His Word and His Spirit to talk to you.
    <br>He works through His Word and His Spirit to heal you.
    <br>He works through His Word and His Spirit to bless you.
    <br>He works through His Word and His Spirit to save you.
    <br>We must meditate on what we read in the 
    <br>Bible and turn it over and over again in our hearts.
    <br>The more we mediate, the more
    <br> our hearts act upon the Word.
    <br>You know; to turn it over and over again in our hearts.
    <br>Not just mediation - it is like pounding yam.
    <br>You pound it - you want to make it a part of you.
    <br>In the process, turn it over and over again in your heart,
    <br>in order to do what the Word says.
    <br>Not just to hear and preach it, or teach it, but to live by it.
    <br>Turn it over.
    <br>That is where meditation comes in.
    <br>The Bible says, the Word becomes 
    <br>part of us by meditation.
    <br>Let someone say that.
    <br>The Word becomes part of us by meditation.
    <br>It becomes part of us by meditation.
    <br>Turn it over and over again in our hearts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is going on in your heart?
    <br>Without this meditation, our conduct and character
    <br>cannot be influenced by the Word of God.
    <br>The more we meditate, the more our 
    <br>hearts act upon the Word -
    <br>the more the Word influences
    <br> our conduct and character.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Like you are listening to me, hearing me,
    <br>keep your heart in order.
    <br>If you don’t get hold of your heart,
    <br> your heart will be doing what it likes.
    <br>You must have control of your heart.
    <br>While you are looking at me, continue that meditation.
    <br>For me, I meditate on the Word day 
    <br>and night and whatever I do prospers.
    <br>Viewers, thank you for your time.
    <br>Meditate on the Word of God day and night.
    <br>No matter how unsteady your life appears
    <br> to be, meditate on the Word day and night
    <br>and whatever you do will prosper.
    <br>Unsteady; your business, your life, 
    <br>your career, your marriage -
    <br>you see, when something is like this you cannot enjoy it.
    <br>If I continue walking like this, I cannot enjoy myself.
    <br>This is how many, if not all business look like today...
    <br>Your marriage...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers, no matter how unsteady
    <br> your life, career, business appear to be,
    <br>meditate on the Word of God day and night and whatever you do will prosper.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>No matter how unsteady your life appears to be, meditate on the Word day and night -
    <br>whatever you do prospers.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Instead of wasting your time; 
    <br>time of prayer, "In the name of Jesus..."
    <br>For me, I meditate on the Word day and night.
    <br>When I say day and night, I mean, 
    <br>I turn it over and over again in my heart.
    <br>Whatever I do, whatever I say - you will see it any moment from now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I prayed the way you are praying,
    <br> I would not be able to do all this.
    <br>The way you pray: you have a book that teaches you how to pray, you list the name of your enemy.
    <br>Sometimes you say, "Lord"...
    <br>This direction is "Lord", this direction is "Jesus Christ",
    <br>this direction is "Jehovah", this direction is "Bread".
    <br>After that you do like this...
    <br>If I prayed the way you pray,
    <br> you would not be here today.
    <br>What you have done to me in the past...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You banned me, you rebuked me  - well done.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Spirit of God will be released to the 
    <br>degree our heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>That is why it is very important that 
    <br>your heart must act upon the Word of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>The Spirit of God will be released to the degree, to the measure
    <br>your heart acts upon the Word of God.
    <br>I mean, the Spirit of God will be 
    <br>released to the degree, to the measure
    <br>we stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where is honour without your heart?
    <br>That is the honour we are giving to God today.
    <br>You come to church, but your heart is not here.
    <br>You worship, many people are dancing
    <br> because they see their colleagues dancing.
    <br>You know - it is a hobby to dance.
    <br>People are dancing, but not with their hearts.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Where is honour without your heart?
    <br>Where is reverence without your heart?
    <br>Today, you see people doing... - without their hearts.
    <br>That is why there is killing, destruction everywhere.
    <br>Your son, daughter, children, wife, husband will wake up, "Good morning, sir" - without their hearts.
    <br>That is why after hearing, "Good morning, sir" - at your back anything can happen.
    <br>The Spirit of God will be released to the
    <br> degree our heart acts upon the Word of God
    <br>but your heart does not honour God.
    <br>And Christianity lies...
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Without your heart, where is honour?
    <br>Without your heart, where is respect?
    <br>Without your heart, where is reverence?
    <br>This is what is happening all over the world today.
    <br>You talk of marriage - marriage without heart.
    <br>That is why there is divorce, little things, "No, I saw a letter. No, this is a phone call..." - excuses everywhere.
    <br>Divorces because of little.
    <br>Marry and re-marry - everywhere.
    <br>You see: home, home; divorce, divorce.
    <br>It has become a game.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Marriage without heart.
    <br>Love without heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Marriage without heart is a marriage 
    <br>that anything can dissolve.
    <br>Situation can separate, fight can separate,
    <br> whatever can separate,
    <br>but a marriage with heart,
    <br>"I love you with all my heart" - the love is from heart;
    <br>only God can separate such marriage.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What can separate me from the love of Christ?
    <br>Can hatred?
    <br>Can fight?
    <br>Can killing?
    <br>Can death?
    <br>What can separate you?
    <br>That is a heart for you.
    <br>Only God can separate marriage of heart.
    <br>In this marriage of heart; "I love you with all my heart. I don't love you because of money, education,
    <br>because you are handsome, beautiful. I don't love you because of whatever, just with heart" -
    <br>only Jesus...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to sing you a song that will make you afraid now.
    <br>You will start to say, "What is this?"
    <br>On the last day
    <br>You see, they refuse to sing along with me.
    <br>On the last day
    <br>Only true believers shall be raptured
    <br>Do you know 
    <br>There is another fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know 
    <br>There is another fellowship in Heaven
    <br>The Spirit of God which you need to be a Christian, you need to be born again,
    <br>you need to be God’s person -
    <br>that Spirit will be released to the degree your heart acts.
    <br>You can call it ‘immerse’ or ‘immersion’.
    <br>... will be released to the degree your heart acts upon the Word of God.
    <br>You say, "I need the Spirit of God."
    <br>You need it, but it can only be released to the degree, to the measure,
    <br>your heart acts; not you.
    <br>Heart means your spirit.
    <br>... upon the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your consistency in prayer and faithfulness is the only way out.
    <br>Your what?
    <br>Consistency in prayer and faithfulness is the only way out.
    <br>Trust and obey
    <br>For there’s no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>But to trust and obey
    <br>Trust and obey
    <br>For there’s no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>But to trust and obey
    <br>Please, constantly pray in your heart without ceasing.
    <br>Without what?
    <br>Ceasing.
    <br>Do you know what it means?
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart.
    <br>Are you praying in your heart?
    <br>What is the meaning of that?
    <br>To pray in the Spirit means to pray in harmony with the Scripture.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>To pray in the Spirit means to pray in harmony with the Scripture.
    <br>Praising the Lord always
    <br>every morning every noon every night
    <br>always
    <br>Praising the Lord with everything in me
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart always
    <br>Lift your voice and say,
    <br>Praising the Lord always
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart
    <br>Open up your mouth and say,
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart always
    <br>Praising the Lord always
    <br>As long as I live
    <br>In Him I live and move and have my being
    <br>Praising the Lord always
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart always
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>My Lord is good
    <br>He is good to me
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>My Lord is good
    <br>He is good to me
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>My Lord is good
    <br>He is good to me
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>My Lord is good
    <br>He is good to me
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your enemy loses no time to plot against you;
    <br>you should lose no time to commit yourself to the Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have a section of time to pray, whereas enemy is always busy, at work.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your enemy is always at work.
    <br>That is how they keep getting you.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You, oh Lord. Thank You, Lord."
    <br>If it is "Thank You, Lord", what you started to say in your heart, it is OK.
    <br>"Thank You, Lord... My gracious love. Thank You, Lord..." - that will continue in you heart.
    <br>Later it will switch to praising and worship.
    <br>Praising the Lord always
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart always
    <br>Can you see that?
    <br>Look at your song - this is the song you are singing, but you are not following it.
    <br>Praising the Lord always
    <br>Can you listen to that?
    <br>‘Always’, that means your heart should continue to praise God.
    <br>Prayer; attitude of prayer.
    <br>Because a break in prayer will mean a break in faith; 
    <br>a break in faith is a break with God.
    <br>Praising the Lord always
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart always
    <br>Are you obeying what you are singing?
    <br>No!
    <br>You are not praising God always.
    <br>You allow your heart to be roaming about.
    <br>You have to pray – that is the only way you can be filled with the Spirit.
    <br>Not this kind of prayer you offer; be on your knee - that is OK,
    <br>it is this meditation that will lead you to going on your knee.
    <br>I mean; you begin to hear from God Himself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your enemy loses no time to plot against you and
    <br>you should lose no time committing yourself.
    <br>This is where we find ourselves today.
    <br>We find ourselves in a very messed situation, when it comes to things of the spirit.
    <br>Bad situation.
    <br>When you are in the business of prayer, constantly praying in your heart without ceasing,
    <br>you will only release, “Be healed”.
    <br>This is what people will hear, and they will be healed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is it!
    <br>Sing this song again.
    <br>Praising the Lord always
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart always
    <br>That is all.
    <br>This is what I'm expecting in your heart now.
    <br>In your heart – constantly praise Him.
    <br>Are you singing that song?
    <br>While you continue singing this song in your heart, the Spirit of God Himself will switch to prayer,
    <br>what to say; He will Himself switch.
    <br>You are not in control of your blood.
    <br>Are you in control of your blood?
    <br>So, you are not to be supposed to be in control of prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are not in control of you blood.
    <br>Your blood can cease; you are not in control.
    <br>It is just running...
    <br>You feel it is running.
    <br>In the same day, you are not supposed to be in control of prayer;
    <br>the prayer is supposed to switch from praises to prayer,
    <br>and when you want to release, you just say, "Be healed, in the name of Jesus. Be delivered in the name...";
    <br>people hear this from you.
    <br>Look at me; do you see any paper, laptop with me?
    <br>I'm talking from the heart.
    <br>Message from the heart, not laptop, not paper, not anything.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm not teaching; if I was teaching, I would have carried my laptop, my book.
    <br>I'm telling you something from the heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I was telling you about someone experienced,
    <br> I would carried my paper.
    <br>No matter how unsteady your career, 
    <br>business appear to be -
    <br>go into the business of praising God in your heart.
    <br>The Bible says, we don’t know how to pray; the Spirit helps us in our weaknesses.
    <br>In your case it is not Spirit that is helping you.
    <br>You have prayer points, and you have the hour to pray,
    <br>and if you don't have any situation you don't pray.
    <br>What dictates direction of our prayer?
    <br>Our situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Our situation dictates the direction of our prayer.
    <br>If we are sick, we say, "God, help me, heal me",
    <br>but if our everything is alright, we say, "Praise the Lord".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Instead of Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Father to dictate the direction of our prayer, what to pray for...
    <br>He helps us in our weaknesses, we don't know how to pray,
    <br>but now, our situation dictates the direction of our prayer.
    <br>Look at Jesus; Jesus was there with a dead man, His friend.
    <br>Instead of Him to say, "Lord, heal, raise!", He said, "Lord, I thank You",
    <br>and the Jews and all other were looking at Him, "You should raise the dead and You are saying 'Thank You';
    <br>Thank you for killing this man, or for this man to die? What are You saying?"
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>Our situation dictates the direction of our prayer.
    <br>When we are sick, we say, "Lord, heal me",
    <br>and if we are not healed, we will never say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Until you are healed.
    <br>And when you are healed, you say, "Hallelujah!"
    <br>Thank you very much.
