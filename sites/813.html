  <p>    
    <br>My name is Nneamaka Edeh.
    <br>We come from Enugu State (Nigeria).
    <br>These are my siblings.
    <br>My parents died in 2005 and since then,
    <br>my sisters and I have been suffering for the past five years.
    <br>We have heard from the sister who said she is from Enugu State.
    <br>She said five years ago, their parents died and they have been orphans,
    <br>and she and the sister standing beside her have been the ones taking care of the siblings.
    <br>For the past five years since the death of their parents, they have been suffering.
    <br>Please, children of God, help us.
    <br>Who is caring for the house?
    <br>Just my sister and I.
    <br>My sister and I are sales girls in Enugu.
    <br>Are you not going to school?
    <br>I finished my secondary school
    <br>but my sister dropped out of secondary school while in SS1 after my parent's death.
    <br>This one is suffering from a shortage of blood
    <br>but there is no money to take her to hospital.

    <br>So what would you do to help them?
    <br>They are five in number. They should give each of them N100,000.
    <br>Put it in an account.
    <br>Please, people of God, come together and help.

    <br>Ukamaka Edeh - Enugu, Nigeria
    <br>My name is Ukamaka Edeh. I am from Enugu State.
    <br>These are my other sisters.
    <br>For the past five years since our parents died,
    <br>we have been struggling to feed our younger ones.
    <br>I dropped out of secondary school in SS1.
    <br>We came down from Enugu State where I am a sales girl.
    <br>But now, I am happy for what the man of God has done for us,
    <br>for giving us hope.

    <br>We are their family, they can come home here; this is their home.
    <br>We want to know how they are doing.
    <br>The one that is sick will be prayed for.
    <br>Those who want to go to school, people of God, please support.
    <br>Thank you.

    <br>They should immediately join the scholarship scheme.
    <br>We will give scholarships to these children
    <br>and let them go back to school. Thank you.

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Nneamaka Edeh. I am 22 years old.
    <br>These are my siblings.
    <br>We are orphans from Enugu State, Nigeria.
    <br>We are members of the Catholic church.
    <br>The problem that brought us to The SCOAN
    <br>was that our parents have been late since 2005.
    <br>There is no money, nobody cares.
    <br>For those five years, I have been working as a sales girl.
    <br>This is my younger sister who dropped out of school.
    <br>For five years we have been suffering
    <br>because there is nobody to help us.
    <br>Things are rough, even to eat and to pay our house rent...
    <br>The worst is that my younger sister sitting there is sick with shortage of blood
    <br>but there is no money to take her to the hospital.
    <br>Yesterday, we came to The SCOAN by night bus.
    <br>Even when my parents were alive, I never saw this amount of money.
    <br>The man of God gave us N500,000, five bags of rice
    <br>and scholarships to any level we want to go to.
    <br>I am so happy; I don't know what to say.
    <br>I am short of words.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>Since morning, I have been saying to myself, "Is this me and can God do this for me?"
    <br>I am so happy. I thank God and give Him the glory.
    <br>Before - I can't lie, this is in the presence of God -
    <br>at times, I slept with men because of money.
    <br>But I promised God that if He helps me and my family, all that rubbish will stop.
    <br>I will never go back to my past life. I really thank God for my life.
    <br>This is a great miracle which I never expected in my life.
    <br>My name is Ukamaka Edeh. Nneamaka is my elder sister.
    <br>I am the second born.
    <br>We are from Enugu State, Nigeria. For the past five years that our parents died,
    <br>we have been struggling to take care of our younger ones.
    <br>I am a sales girl like my sister.
    <br>Pastor T.B. Joshua gave us N500,000 and five bags of rice.
    <br>He also gave me and my younger ones scholarships
    <br>so that we can go back to school.
    <br>I am very grateful. May God bless T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My name is Edeh Chinyere.
    <br>I am very grateful because before, there was nothing to eat,
    <br>let alone go to school.
    <br>God has really answered our prayers because when we came here,
    <br>we received a cash gift of N500,000 and five bags of rice.
    <br>I am very grateful. May God bless T.B. Joshua.
    <br>My name is Miracle.
    <br>How do you feel today seeing the man of God blessing you with such huge amount of money -
    <br>N500,000 - five bags of rice, a copy of the Holy Bible, and this wonderful book?
    <br>I feel very happy.
    <br>My name is Chinedu.
    <br>I am sick.
    <br>I am short of blood.
    <br>My sisters don't have money to take care of me.
    <br>Now that you have come to a place where
    <br>Jesus Christ had paid the price for your healing,
    <br>and through the grace in the life of His anointed servant,
    <br>you are set free from your illness
    <br>and you have also been blessed by the anointed man of God
    <br>with N500,000, a copy of the Holy Bible, the Mirror book, and five bags of rice.
    <br>How do you feel?
    <br>I feel very happy.
    <br>Glory be to God that you can have a cause to smile
    <br>in spite of the pains that you are going through.
    <br>And indeed, Jesus Christ is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>I am so happy.
    <br>My advice to people out there - because I know there are many people like us.
    <br>All I can say to them is that they should have faith and be patient with God.
    <br>God's time is the best. When God blesses you and lifts you up,
    <br>that is the best for everyone.
    <br>I really thank God.
    <br>The hope you have been given today, is an everlasting one
    <br>because you have just found a father that is greater than all fathers
    <br>and a friend that is closer than a brother.
    <br>That is Jesus Christ in the life of His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And with what God Almighty has done in your lives,
    <br>we want to encourage you to stay in faith in Christ Jesus
    <br>and remember that it is for the salvation of your soul
    <br>that God Almighty has blessed you immensely.
    <br>And we want to pray that God will give you the inner grace
    <br>to live by the Word of God and this blessing you have received
    <br>will multiply in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
