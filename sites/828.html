    <br>GOD HAS ORDERED ALL
    <br>It is time you should be a producer not a consumer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, 'Be a producer, not a consumer'.
    <br>This is the problem we are facing in our continent Africa.
    <br>What is it?
    <br>Instead of using our mineral resources to exchange technology,
    <br>we use it to exchange dollars and pounds.
    <br>Instead of using the mineral resources the Lord has given us,
    <br>and take it, "Hey, you need something from me?
    <br>We Africa, we carry our property, our mineral resources.
    <br>Instead of giving them and using it to receive the technology they have,
    <br>we give them and receive dollars and pounds.
    <br>We keep...
    <br>If we used these mineral resources to get technology,
    <br>nobody would embezzle money.
    <br>If there was a law that these mineral resources should not be exchanged for dollars and pounds,
    <br>but rather for technology - when I want to give something to America,
    <br>I will look at what they are good at in technology.
    <br>Give me your technology, let me give you my oil. The corruption would come to an end.
    <br>In Nigeria, for example, we have oil. Then, if in Nigeria there was a law that if any country needed this oil,
    <br>we would need to check what the other country's technology or mineral resources are.
    <br>Our own is oil - if there was a law that they give their mineral resources
    <br>while we equally give our own mineral resources, no money would be exchanged.
    <br>The country today would become a pilgrimage.
    <br>But today, what is happening to the dollars and pounds we receive?
    <br>So, Africa and other countries that are complaining that they are poor, you are not poor.
    <br>It is only that you exchange your mineral resources with dollars and pounds.
    <br>We say there is no employment, there is no job for the youths. Why?
    <br>Because dollars and pounds are not a company.
    <br>But if we use our mineral resources to exchange to receive technology from overseas,
    <br>jobs would be everywhere. The youths would have a job.
    <br>When we need money, we can sell and buy yam, cocoyam, and all other stuffs to get money.
    <br>But oil, gold, and all other mineral resources God has given you,
    <br>should not be exchanged with money.
    <br>It should not be oil for money, but oil for technology.
    <br>Say, 'Not oil for money, oil for technology'.
    <br>Tell the whole world: 'Not oil for money,  oil for technology'.
    <br>GOD HAS ORDERED ALL
