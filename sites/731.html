  <p>    
    <br>There is a lady I met at the emergency here.
    <br>Where is she?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Come.
    <br>Do you know the reason I brought you out?
    <br>I'm seeing you on a cemetery and you were given something like blood to drink as an initiation.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>It was in the night.
    <br>You went to the cemetery...
    <br>A brother carried you there, who acted as your boyfriend.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Since then, your life has not been the same.
    <br>It has never.
    <br>There's nothing since that time – smoking, drinking, cocaine, drugs, whatever - evil things are in your hands.
    <br>Yes man of God, it is true.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The spirit of killing, stealing, destruction – out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>She was carried to a cemetery and given blood.
    <br>She drank the blood as an initiation into a society.
    <br>Since then every evil thing you can talk of...
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Do you see?
    <br>I'm feeling what is inside her stomach.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>If I remove my hand now she will get over.
    <br>What's your name?
    <br>Tricia.
    <br>Now, she has been delivered, she has no fear but the fear of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where were you carried to?
    <br>I was carried to a cemetery.
    <br>OK and there you drank what?
    <br>I was given blood in a bowl.
    <br>Shout the name, "Jesus".
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>Down she goes.
    <br>There is mighty power in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>She is free!
    <br>Glory be to God in the highest.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>My name is Tricia. 
    <br>I am from Botswana.
    <br>Tell us what was the message of prophecy you received from the man of God today.
    <br>This is my first visit to The SCOAN.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua came into the crowd and pulled me out.
    <br>He said he saw a graveyard and a bowl and that this young lady was taking blood from the bowl
    <br>as an initiation into satanism and that she was initiated by her boyfriend.
    <br>The man of God said that since then, nothing in my life has ever been the same.
    <br>He said I stared drinking, smoking, taking drugs, sleeping around with men
    <br>and that is true because I remember three and a half years ago, I had my boyfriend
    <br>and he initiated me into satanism.
    <br>One night, he took me out, we went drinking and taking drugs and he said we would be taking drugs
    <br>with some of his other friends and relatives.
    <br>We took a drive to a cemetery.
    <br>When we got there, they started singing weird songs and praying in so many ways.
    <br>There were a lot of people there.
    <br>As it was happening that night, I remember I was marked with some black stuff and covered
    <br>in a black cloth.
    <br>They surrounded me and started praying again.
    <br>As they were praying, a bowl of blood was being passed round and everybody who was there
    <br>was drinking blood.
    <br>As they were passing the bowl of the blood round among themselves,
    <br>you were also given this bowl, like the man of God said - is that right?
    <br>Yes, that is right.
    <br>Did you drink it?
    <br>I drank it.
    <br>I'm seeing you on a cemetery and you were given something like blood to drink as an initiation.
    <br>Yes, it it true.
    <br>It was in the night.
    <br>You went to a cemetery...
    <br>A brother carried you there, who acted as your boyfriend.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Since then, your life has not been the same.
    <br>It has never.
    <br>There's nothing since that time – smoking, drinking, cocaine, drugs, whatever - evil things are in your hands.
    <br>Yes man of God, it is true.
    <br>Ever since then, I started drinking, smoking, taking drugs; I wasn't staying at home.
    <br>I was always on the move and never had the time to spend with my family.
    <br>At that time I was always angry.
    <br>Every time I was with my family, I just felt like grabbing them and strangling them or jumping
    <br>onto them and doing something bad to them.
    <br>What was responsible for that?
    <br>The evil spirit – the initiation that took place.
    <br>Tell us, did you make any effort to get a deliverance from this before coming to The SCOAN?
    <br>If yes  - what effort did you make?
    <br>I remember two years back, I went for a crusade in Botswana and that time I told them
    <br>I really wanted to be delivered.
    <br>But I was too influenced to go back there.
    <br>From there, I started going back to my old life and my dad told me that he was going to pay for me
    <br>to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I didn't feel good about it, I actually ran away from home at that time.
    <br>I stayed almost a month and a half without seeing my family because I was told to do so.
    <br>One day he called me and said I should just come home.
    <br>So, I left where I was staying, went home and we actually talked about it
    <br>and came to a point of agreement that I was going to The SCOAN and here I am standing, delivered
    <br>and I have accepted Jesus in my heart.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Tell us, when you left your home - where you went to and what was happening at that time with you.
    <br>At that time I was staying with my boyfriend, who was my boyfriend at that time and
    <br>sometimes I stayed with my friends and we weren't even staying in a house, we would just go to the house
    <br>to change and go clubbing, drinking, taking drugs, smoking, doing every negative thing we could think of.
    <br>Tell us, what kind of feelings, experiences or dreams were you having after that initiation.
    <br>Sometimes I dreamt of dead people; sometimes I dreamt of people wearing black trying to kill me.
    <br>Sometimes – even if I was alone in the house, I'd just fear - I'd feel as if there was something wrong
    <br>inside the house.
    <br>I wasn't secure about myself.
    <br>Before the prophecy, I felt like running away when I was sitting there.
    <br>But as the man of God was praying for me I felt as if there was something heavy getting our of my body.
    <br>It just came out and I felt lighter and better from then.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The spirit of killing, stealing, destruction – out!
    <br>But as the man of God was praying for me I felt as if there was something heavy getting our of my body.
    <br>It just came out and I felt lighter and better from then.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Now, with what you have experienced; you are telling us that you are totally delivered?
    <br>Yes, I am. I am totally delivered.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Now, for the benefit of those who are listening to this wonderful testimony;
    <br>can you give a word of advice, especially to youth out there, and to people generally?
    <br>What do you want them to learn from your experience?
    <br>And those who are still entangled in the wilderness of evil - what advice do you have for them?
    <br>I would say they should come out from where they are and accept Jesus as their Saviour;
    <br>they should just accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour.
    <br>I pray that God uses me as a person to show them that whatever they are doing,
    <br>they can always come out of the situation they're in now.
    <br>I remember confronting a witchdoctor; I went there alone and I thought it would be better
    <br>but nothing worked out.
    <br>I went for a crusade and they tried their best but it's just that the force from the dark side, the evil side was too
    <br>much on me. That's why it happened that I went back there.
    <br>We could see you screaming when the man of God laid hand on you.
    <br>Can you tell us what you felt at that time?
    <br>At that time I was having those visions of what was happening at the grave.
    <br>At the same time it was like the thing, that whatever was coming out of me was just too much for me.
    <br>So, I started screaming.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Now you are totally delivered.
    <br>We want to encourage you to make the Word of God a standard for your life.
    <br>The Bible says - those who are delivered by Christ's Word must be ruled by His Word.
    <br>As you do so, the deliverance you have received today will be permanent in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Here is Mr Jacob.
    <br>I am from Botswana.
    <br>The reason I'm here today - on the 18th of April 2010,
    <br>a miracle happened right here at The SCOAN.
    <br>I wanted to be here with my daughter that day but because of circumstances beyond my control,
    <br>I couldn't make it.
    <br>She had to come on her own here and she got her deliverance.
    <br>For three to four years, I went through serious parental pain because of this little girl.
    <br>I think at the age of thirteen, somehow somewhere in this crazy world, she came across some evil people,
    <br>she came across some agents of lucifer.
    <br>They recruited her into their kingdom; they initiated her and she was lost.
    <br>And you know, if you lose a daughter through the work of the devil the whole house becomes possessed
    <br>because of the evil spirits;
    <br>you don’t find peace with your family; you don’t find peace with your wife; I'd always fight and say to my wife,
    <br>'I think you know where my daughter is. You really can't tell me that you are here sleeping and the daughter
    <br>is not in the house'.
    <br>But at the end of the day, something told me that there was a man of God.
    <br>In 2005, he visited my country, Botswana.
    <br>I went to that crusade and saw people being delivered.
    <br>5th January I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>For three years she was out of school.
    <br>She wanted to go back to school.
    <br>We talked with the mother and gave her the school fees.
    <br>The first school we went they said she was too old, that she couldn't do form four.
    <br>At seventeen.
    <br>The second school, the same story.
    <br>I said to my wife, "For God's sake, I'm not facing the devil again. Give me that school fees.
    <br>I want to pay for this girl's trip to Nigeria, to The SCOAN."
    <br>And by God's grace my wife didn't give me any problem; she gave me the money and I looked for my own airfare.
    <br>I paid but when she came, I stayed behind.
    <br>When her group went back, I phoned some people here and said I didn't want my daughter to come back home.
    <br>I was afraid it was too early.
    <br>I was afraid because she came here without me, without her mother.
    <br>I wanted her to stay behind for two weeks until I'd be there and I am here.
    <br>I am here with her and I'm seeing a different person, a completely different young girl.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Can you tell us, sir, when your daughter came to The SCOAN - were you back at home watching her
    <br>during that Sunday Service?
    <br>I was home watching her.
    <br>You know, since January...
    <br>It's difficult for me to attend any church.
    <br>Most of the time, my church is my sitting room.
    <br>I watch Emmanuel TV at home almost every Sunday alone in that house.
    <br>But that Sunday everybody was there.
    <br>We saw the first service.
    <br>I had the Bible in my hands praying, "Let the hand of God point to my daughter.
    <br>Let the man of God prophesy to my daughter".
    <br>Indeed – he saw her at the prayer line.
    <br>I said, "I think I saw light".
    <br>Then at the second service, the TV's went off in my village because it was raining.
    <br>We couldn’t see it but my cell phone started ringing.
    <br>I switched off my phone but believe me, I wept like a little baby.
    <br>I didn’t see that picture but everybody started calling, asking that, "Did you see your daughter?"
    <br>And I cried more because my old mother was there sitting beside me.
    <br>The relationship between my family and me was all gone because of this little girl.
    <br>But that Sunday, they started coming as if they were always in my house and I said, "Thank God!"
    <br>I said if this family could know that the living God is there; if they could realise that God is alive,
    <br>I didn’t have to say, "Forgive me" or "I forgive you".
    <br>That day, they came in one by one and started praising our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's clap for Jesus!
    <br>Believe me, even yesterday, I understand that they were all at my place.
    <br>This is a really wonderful moment.
    <br>This lady has changed and I'm so happy.
    <br>She is a changed lady.
    <br>I've been a believer and I've been a Christian but like T.B. Joshua also says,
    <br>I was just a traditional Christian, I was just a traditional believer;
    <br>but now I am a true Christian and a true believer.
    <br>We thank God for your life and the restoration, God Almighty has brought to you and your home.
    <br>Thank you very much for sharing it with us.
    <br>Can we clap for Jesus?
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Now we want to speak to this young lady sitting next to you.
    <br>Please take the microphone.
    <br>Can you tell us your name and who is this man sitting next to you here?
    <br>My name is Tricia.
    <br>I am from Botswana.
    <br>This is my dad sitting next to me.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN for Sunday service and the man of God prophesied that there's a lady here
    <br>and he came to me and pulled me out of the crowd, and he asked me if I knew why he took me out of the crowd.
    <br>I'm seeing you on a cemetery and you were given something like blood to drink as an initiation.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>It was in the night.
    <br>You went to a cemetery...
    <br>A brother carried you there, who acted as your boyfriend.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Since then, your life has not been the same.
    <br>It has never.
    <br>There's nothing since that time – smoking, drinking, cocaine, drugs, whatever - evil things are in your hands.
    <br>Yes, man of God, it is true.
    <br>And he prayed for me and I got delivered and ever since that day
    <br>I have never had the same dreams I used to have.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>After the prophecy the man of God prayed for you.
    <br>What did you experience when the man of God prayed for you?
    <br>I wasn’t really feeling myself at that time but ever since then, I think I have really changed because
    <br>ever since I got here, I've never craved for alcohol or drugs and if I remember very well,
    <br>I bought a pack of cigarettes at the Johannesburg airport and I only took one cigarette from there.
    <br>I came here with the pack but I couldn’t take any more because ever since I walked through
    <br>that gate, I have never ever craved for cigarettes again.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Can you be bold and tell us how old are you having experienced all this in life?
    <br>I am 17 years old.
    <br>What is your advice to those who are watching and listening to you, after you have been delivered
    <br>and you are living a new life?
    <br>My advice to all those people that live the life I used to live,
    <br>I will tell them to come to Jesus, repent and accept Jesus as their Saviour.
    <br>They shouldn't be scared of what is going to happen to them because once you are here,
    <br>God is going to fight the battle for you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Can you give us a very special message?
    <br>What do you want to say to your father and your family, that is watching you at home?
    <br>I'd like to say I'm sorry for destroying my family, it wasn't really what I wanted to do.
    <br>I would like to say I'm sorry.
    <br>And now that I have changed, I promise never to do the bad things I used to do.
    <br>Can we see you giving your father a warm embrace after all these years of problems and difficulties?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Daddy, I'm sorry and my family at home.
    <br>I'm really sorry for what I did; I love all of you.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remember, as the Prophet taught us on Sunday - "Love does not discuss sin.
    <br>Love does not draw attention to sin".
    <br>As the Bible says - "Love covers a multitude of sins by forgiving".
    <br>Let us clap for our Lord Jesus Christ!
