  <p>    
    <br>God's undisputable and incontestable power is being demonstrated
    <br>as the Morning Water is ministered by the evangelists sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua in Jesus' name.
    <br>As satanic forces tremble at the mention of the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>the demons confess their evil activities.
    <br>Watch and see what happened when light met darkness in the life of this woman.
    <br>Fire all over your body! Fire! Fire in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Speak out! Who are you?
    <br>Ministration Of The Morning Water in Jesus' Name
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>We are the marine goddess.
    <br>How many of you are inside this body?
    <br>We are two billion.
    <br>Ministration Of The Morning Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>Who else?
    <br>Python.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>So, you are a python. Fire!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>What have you done to her, you demon?
    <br>I slept with the family and they used her to do a sacrifice.
    <br>We initiated her but that is the same girl who called on the Most High God.
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>He wants to equip her with power and strength but we don't agree.
    <br>We came to fight her with two billion serpents.
    <br>How do you destroy them - her family?
    <br>I kill them like chicken!
    <br>You kill them like chicken?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How? Explain. How do you operate?
    <br>I kill them. They have sinned against me, so I kill them.
    <br>How many of them have you killed?
    <br>Uncountable. She doesn't know her mother. I killed her father too.
    <br>You killed the mother and the father?
    <br>I killed all of the family; she doesn't know them.
    <br>She was running away from my kingdom.
    <br>Who are you that is killing them?
    <br>I am Korle.
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>She's very brilliant but we don't want her to succeed because of Divine strength and power.
    <br>Why don't you want her succeed?
    <br>Because she is our sacrificial lamb.
    <br>Sacrificial lamb?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They have used her to atone for the sin committed by her great-great-grandparents.
    <br>They dedicated her to you?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>What else have you done to her?
    <br>We caused her to sleep with people, so that we can gain more people in our marine kingdom.
    <br>You cause her to sleep with people?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How? Explain, you demon! How do you operate? How do you use her?
    <br>Be very careful with me! Do you understand?
    <br>Speak out! How do you use her?
    <br>We entered her and we entered the man too.
    <br>You entered her and the man too?
    <br>It's so that we can get the souls in our kingdom.
    <br>What else have you done to her?
    <br>We killed her but your master created another body within her.
    <br>You killed her?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We cut her heart but your master sewed it.
    <br>We even bombed and shot her but she didn't die.
    <br>That's why we entered her with two billion snakes
    <br>so that we can tie her down before the two queens.
    <br>How long have you been in this body, you demon?
    <br>Since childhood.
    <br>She flies like a vulture, like an eagle.
    <br>You fly like an eagle?
    <br>Yes, because she's a warrior.
    <br>When you fly, what happens? What do you do?
    <br>We fight in the dark clouds; we are the agents of the dark clouds.
    <br>Look, when rain wanted to fall, it did not because the cloud was very dark.
    <br>We used someone to block the cloud but she stood and prayed and the barrier was broken.
    <br>Now, the rain is falling. The time has come but we have come to fight.
    <br>OK. Right now it is time for you to go in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ! All over your body! In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus!
    <br>Your ring, your crown. Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! Your ring, crown, all over your body - fire in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire! All over your body in the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ!
    <br>There's no hiding place for you demon! Fire!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! All over your body! Fire! Your ring, your crown, your head!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! Wherever that power is located! Fire!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! Fire! There's no hiding place for you demon!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body! Your head! Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>There's no hiding place for you! Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body! Wherever that power is located! In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! All over your body! Your head, your toes! Take your rings, your crown!
    <br>Fire! You python! You demon! Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your ring, your crown! Take them off! In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! Out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' name! You are declared free in Jesus' name!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Indeed God is with us.
    <br>My name is Mary Penuku Nenyo. I come from Ghana - the Volta region.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was held in bondage - serious bondage.
    <br>Because of Christ, I was transferred from the kingdom of darkness to His marvellous light.
    <br>Mary 
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>My testimony goes like this.
    <br>My parents had their origin from Bakpa, Awaduwe.
    <br>They travelled to Ivory Coast and stayed there for fishing.
    <br>During that time, I was born to them.
    <br>Then, a message came to them one day that my family needed me
    <br>and that they should release me to them
    <br>to atone for the sin committed by my great-great-grandfather.
    <br>They told my family that there were serious deaths in the family because
    <br>my great-great-grandfather had sinned against the God, Korle,
    <br>which resulted in a curse in my family.
    <br>So, they said the gods had appointed me and that I was the only one they could send to him
    <br>to atone for the sin committed by my great-great-grandfather.
    <br>So, explain to us what it was you were told that your great-great-grandfather actually committed.
    <br>They said that my great-great-grandfather had slept with a 'Trokosi', an outcast.
    <br>My great-great-grandfather slept with an outcast, which resulted in a curse in the family.
    <br>In a week, up to ten or five people could die in my family.
    <br>They had gone to ask the oracle, Korle, and it said it was the one killing the people in my family.
    <br>So, it said it needed a maiden virgin girl - a baby girl for a sacrifice.
    <br>Because of fear, anxiety and trauma in the family, they took me from my mother
    <br>to go and atone for the sin.
    <br>It happened that my mother couldn't carry the burden, so, it was my father who brought me
    <br>to my home town in Ghana.
    <br>Then, they bought hoes, cutlasses, clothes and beads like for someone who was getting married -
    <br>a bride.
    <br>They took me to Mamfi Ougame (Korle's shrine) for the atonement.
    <br>In an initiation rite, they took me to the riverside and initiated me on a journey of no return.
    <br>A journey of no return.
    <br>Then, public humiliation was organised - they needed to humiliate me in public.
    <br>So, I was humiliated - my clothes were stripped.
    <br>They tore them and my hair was shaved.
    <br>I was then introduced to an old priest as my husband together with other maidens.
    <br>So, you mean to say, sister, that as a very young girl ... just give us an idea of your age at this period
    <br>when you were taken and given as a sacrifice to this shrine.
    <br>I didn't actually recollect my age but I was very young.
    <br>We had seniors. It was like a system.
    <br>So, they told me that I was one year old when they took me to the shrine.
    <br>This was how I was humiliated. I endured public humiliation.
    <br>They humiliate you.
    <br>The work we do in the Trokosi system:
    <br>We had seniors and I was a junior - very young. They gave me a name 'Mamavi'.
    <br>That means, 'Small Trokosi girl, small outcast'.
    <br>As my job, I had to kneel down and pray to the oracle,
    <br>"Let somebody sin so we can get more people in our kingdom".
    <br>There were seniors and they had to come so that another person would come after me,
    <br>so that I too would become a senior.
    <br>In my case, I prayed in my language, 'Evineva lo', which means, 'Let somebody come'
    <br>because I was tired.
    <br>But, in my case, nobody was coming.
    <br>Another thing we also did - the priest would just point at you -
    <br>he could call us chicken, goat or cow because we were cows to him;
    <br>then, he would call us and sleep with us just like that.
    <br>You are talking as if there are many young ladies like yourself in that shrine.
    <br>Can you tell us how many people were in this slavery, in this shrine?
    <br>We were about 500 in that shrine where they kept me - Korle shrine.
    <br>There were other shrines but ours was the headquarters.
    <br>And all of these girls - you mean to say that a very elderly man, a priest, a chief priest
    <br>was actually sleeping with all these young ladies as a ritual.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>He would point at you, 'Goat, chicken, cow - line up!' And he would sleep with you.
    <br>On top of it, when he slept with you and you got pregnant and gave birth,
    <br>you had to take care of the child alone.
    <br>They wouldn't help you but the child belonged to them.
    <br>Another task given to us was to bring hoes and cutlasses to the shrine to farm
    <br>for the priests.
    <br>As a junior - they gathered all the 5,000, their hoes, cutlasses, and the farmland was very far -
    <br>I had to carry them for my seniors.
    <br>When we crossed the river, sometimes I would fall inside.
    <br>Nobody else was coming. They said I had brought another spirit to the shrine.
    <br>You were talking about the work you were doing in the shrine
    <br>as someone that had been dedicated to these gods right from the age of one years old.
    <br>You were also mentioning about preparing charms for people. Can you explain more about this?
    <br>In the system, people would come.
    <br>Since I had not attained my puberty rights,
    <br>I was the one - being a junior - to prepare charms for people.
    <br>Armed robbers would come. I would prepare charms for them so that when they got shot,
    <br>they would not die, and even if they got cut, it would not penetrate.
    <br>My assignment was to prepare charms.
    <br>The more charms I prepared, the more evil spirits entered me.
    <br>Mary
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>When the priest finally died, I was accused of bringing a different spirit; that I was an evil child.
    <br>I didn't say anything.
    <br>Mary
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>When the priest died, I was very young
    <br>but since he was my husband, I had to perform widowhood rites.
    <br>The widowhood rites continued. They had to shave my head.
    <br>I was confined to a room and had to stay there for six days without water and food.
    <br>On the third day, I could not continue with the hunger and thirst, and I collapsed.
    <br>But with God on my side, I revived. I continued the rituals.
    <br>After six months, they cleansed us from the widowhood rites.
    <br>Then, life continued like that and every day, we were performing our duties.
    <br>I was very stubborn. I would move around.
    <br>They warned us not to go out and that if they caught anyone going out,
    <br>the person would be severely punished.
    <br>But for me, that wouldn't enter my head because I needed food to eat.
    <br>I needed food at all costs.
    <br>I would sneak out to go to churches and other places to hide.
    <br>Sometimes other children would be following me, 'Hey, Mamavi!'
    <br>because they had never seen such before - we were naked.
    <br>I didn't mind them because I needed food.
    <br>One time, I went out as usual to ask for food from people.
    <br>Some tourists came to one of the villages to snap photos.
    <br>They saw me, and it was strange to them. So they told me to stop.
    <br>In the shrine, they had warned us not to talk about it,
    <br>saying that our families would be destroyed and we would die if we ever did.
    <br>I would tell them that I didn't want that but behind their back I would say, 'Let it happen'
    <br>because I didn't like this kind of lifestyle.
    <br>The tourists met me and snapped this photograph of me.
    <br>They asked me why I was in that condition, and I explained everything to them.
    <br>Six months later, they came back again and negotiated with the shrine owners
    <br>saying that their system was very barbaric and inhumane.
    <br>They told them that they had captured young girls and kept them just to use them,
    <br>which was not good.
    <br>They came to an agreement to liberate us. They paid a huge amount -
    <br>six million Cedis (Ghanaian currency) and a cow.
    <br>The foreigners were able to pay the money and the cow.
    <br>At first, they didn't agree to collect the amount because they asked whether the cow was for them to sleep with.
    <br>Later, they agreed and finally, they liberated us.
    <br>So, just to understand what you are saying, sister.
    <br>One time when you had actually escaped from the shrine, looking for food,
    <br>you met some foreigners who were tourists
    <br>who actually took a picture of you, and you explained the circumstances that you were in.
    <br>Several months later, the same foreigners actually came with another organisation
    <br>and actually bargained with the head of that shrine
    <br>and agreed to an exchange of money and also some other items
    <br>to release yourself and the other girls that were in captivity in that shrine.
    <br>Now, how old were you at this point?
    <br>I was eight years old.
    <br>So, you have been in that shrine your whole life.
    <br>As long as you can remember, you were living and brought up in that shrine?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you mean to say that the picture we are seeing here,
    <br>was the picture that was taken by these foreign tourists who met you in that condition?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK
    <br>After our liberation, the liberation brought about another problem.
    <br>I didn't know where to go to because I couldn't remember my village or where I came from.
    <br>So, there was an elderly woman, an inmate, who took interest in me and took care of me.
    <br>She was the one who told me the story about myself, which I told earlier.
    <br>She said she knew where I came from - an island called Awaduwe.
    <br>She showed me where I was from, and I traced my family house.
    <br>When I went there, they told me I couldn't enter.
    <br>They said if I entered the house, I may bring the curse back to them.
    <br>So, I was banished again from my family.
    <br>I had nowhere to go to. So, I had to return back to the shrine, to stay there alone.
    <br>So, at the age of eight, you actually found where your family was living
    <br>but they banished and rejected you again.
    <br>Yes, they rejected me, saying that if they welcomed me back to the family,
    <br>I might bring the curse back to them.
    <br>They had actually used me as a sacrifice. So, if they welcomed me,
    <br>I might bring the curse back to them.
    <br>So, I was driven out of the town.
    <br>So, I went back. I had nowhere else to go to.
    <br>I went back to stay in the shrine alone.
    <br>Life continued there.
    <br>I had to fend for myself.
    <br>I would go and pluck mangoes.
    <br>When people burned their charcoals, I would go and pick some and sell
    <br>in order to take care of myself.
    <br>I stayed alone for about three years.
    <br>One day when I was selling, an NGO, 'International Needs Organisation', saw me.
    <br>They told me, "Mamavi, we have liberated you. Why are you still here?"
    <br>Then I told her the other side of my story.
    <br>After our liberation, they gave training to the older ones.
    <br>While others were given money to settle down with.
    <br>Some were trained to do handicraft.
    <br>As for me, being at that tender age and my family didn't even want me -
    <br>if you gave them that kind of money, they may collect it but they wouldn't take care of me.
    <br>I said they should keep the money and use it to take care of me
    <br>and help me to go to school to the level I wanted.
    <br>When I was in the shrine, I loved school because I saw how school children dressed up nicely
    <br>and going to school.
    <br>I liked it.
    <br>So, when they went to school like that, I would go and hide under the teacher's table
    <br>so that I could learn because if the other children saw me, they would be hooting at me,
    <br>calling me 'Mamavi' because of the way I dressed.
    <br>So, I would hide under the teacher's table, and the teacher liked me.
    <br>I would go under to see what they were writing.
    <br>I would also draw a line and write, 'A B C 1 2 3'.
    <br>That time, I knew how to spell, 'Standing, sitting, eating, pulling, pushing' and all that.
    <br>So, you mean to say, sister, that you were brought up not wearing any clothes.
    <br>You were brought up living naked, moving around naked. That is how you were actually brought up?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The foreigners took me and said that since I had chosen education, they would educate me.
    <br>They handed me over to some people who paid my school fees,
    <br>bought books and other things for me.
    <br>God saw me through, and I was able to complete Senior Secondary School
    <br>with the help of I.N. (NGO).
    <br>After my education, problems and challenges started
    <br>between the woman I was staying with and I.N. (NGO).
    <br>The woman kicked me out. So, I had to go.
    <br>After I was kicked out of the village, I was introduced to an old relative in Aflao (Ghana).
    <br>Since I had been kicked out, I had to go there and stay with her.
    <br>That was like going from the frying pan to fire.
    <br>That was when the suffering started.
    <br>But before you go ahead, sister, just to understand what you are saying.
    <br>Even though you had physically left this shrine and people were trying to help you
    <br>go through education, because those evil spirits were still inside of you,
    <br>it was still pushing you to live a life of slavery. To the point of wherever you went,
    <br>you were experiencing that extreme suffering. Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I experienced rejection.
    <br>In my life, I stayed with 11 people and experienced a series of rejections.
    <br>They would sack me, "Go away", and I wouldn't know what to do.
    <br>I stayed with 11 people and experience maltreatment and abuse.
    <br>So, I went back.
    <br>The spirits still came to me.
    <br>When I went to Aflao, I had a dream that cars were destroyed
    <br>and rapture had taken place.
    <br>Cars and buildings were being destroyed. People were flying but I could not fly.
    <br>Then, I saw the Saviour, the Most High God, Jesus Christ.
    <br>So, what we understand from what our sister is saying,
    <br>she has really passed through many terrible, horrific life experiences
    <br>before her final coming to The SCOAN.
    <br>And you were explaining, sister, that those spirits continued to attack you.
    <br>Could you explain to us, just briefly, how those attacks would happen
    <br>and how that would affect you and cause you to behave?
    <br>I talked about abuses - sexual abuse.
    <br>Any man I met always wanted to sleep with me.
    <br>Even if I told them my story, they would want to sleep with me.
    <br>The demons would enter the men and make them sleep with me.
    <br>When they would finish sleeping with me, they would tell me, "Go, I don't need you any longer"
    <br>and I would go.
    <br>I met a man who said the international NGO was not taking care of me properly.
    <br>He said he loved me and I too said I loved him. He said he wanted to help and marry me.
    <br>After sleeping with me, he said, "Everybody has needs",
    <br>that if I thought my needs would be provided by him, I was joking. He drove me out.
    <br>When I went to Aflao, I had a dream where I saw Jesus Christ:
    <br>Cars and building were being destroyed; I saw people flying - they were going to Heaven.
    <br>But I could not fly.
    <br>Then, I asked Jesus why I couldn't fly; that was it because of my sin,
    <br>that I had sinned against Him and could not control myself?
    <br>Then, He told me that He would put something on me that would stop me from sinning.
    <br>Sister, we want to now talk about the area whereby you actually found yourself here at The SCOAN.
    <br>We know that journey starting a long time ago. Even when you had that revelation.
    <br>Even in the midst of this terrible attack.
    <br>But, because of time, we want to understand how you finally came to be in The SCOAN.
    <br>So, just explain that to us.
    <br>During my trials, when I was wounded and broken on 'my way to Damascus',
    <br>I met a 'Good Samaritan', a woman. I told her my story.
    <br>After that dream, snakes were entering my body. I could see them.
    <br>They entered my veins, stomach. They were three pythons.
    <br>They entered inside me. They were here. Another one passed here.
    <br>Another one passed here. Very big. Another one passed here.
    <br>Then, the small ones used to tie me.
    <br>So, I told the woman about it.
    <br>She said that the only person who could deliver me
    <br>from all those demons was Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That Good Samaritan, that woman helped me but it wasn't easy. It was very tough.
    <br>Sorry, sister. You mean to say that this Good Samaritan actually assisted you to come here to The SCOAN.
    <br>Is that right?
    <br>She met you, and you explained your terrible situation.
    <br>She now advised you that God would use Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver you,
    <br>and she assisted you to come here.
    <br>Now, by the grace of God, we know that last week you were here in The SCOAN.
    <br>Finally, God brought you here. Two weeks ago, you were here in The SCOAN.
    <br>Tell us your experience when you came to the Church and the Morning Water was ministered to you.
    <br>When we got here and the Morning Water was ministered, a giant man rose within me.
    <br>He was talking inside of me.
    <br>Suddenly, it felt as if someone punched me in my face, and I fell down.
    <br>When I got up, I thought the evangelist had punched me. So, I wanted to fight him.
    <br>I wanted to ask him why he had punched me.
    <br>But looking at the video before coming out today, I saw that nobody punched me -
    <br>it was a divine punch.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, during that whole period of the deliverance, all you could recall
    <br>was as if a giant man was within you, fighting, speaking
    <br>and suddenly you experienced something hitting you.
    <br>And you fell to the ground. That was the power of God defeating those demonic forces
    <br>that had held you captive since your childhood. Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Glory be to God! Ever since that incredible deliverance here, at The SCOAN,
    <br>just tell us the changes that you have witnessed in your life.
    <br>Before, I couldn't sleep at night.
    <br>I would have to move around because I couldn't stay in one place.
    <br>If I would sit down before, I would feel as if I was sitting on a snake
    <br>and if I wanted to sleep, I would feel as if I was lying on a snake. So, I almost ran mad.
    <br>I had already ran mad. But after that punch, all the snakes melted away.
    <br>Mary 
    <br>(Deliverance Testimony)
    <br>I was able to sleep like a baby.
    <br>Before, I never knew I was a normal human being.
    <br>I never saw myself as a normal human being.
    <br>But now, divinity has mixed with my humanity.
    <br>I am now a normal human being, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, our sister really knows what she is talking about.
    <br>She has been under this bondage for her entire life.
    <br>And just since the deliverance, she has been walking and living in freedom.
    <br>Sister, how old are you right now?
    <br>I don't know my age, and I don't know my mother. I don't know her name,
    <br>I don't know my age. So, I can't tell you how old I am.
    <br>So, as you are talking now, you have no idea of the whereabouts of your parents,
    <br>or your extended family members? Because right from your childhood, as a baby,
    <br>you were separated from them.
    <br>No.
    <br>So, we can really understand what our sister has actually passed through
    <br>as a result of this evil spirit that entered her right from her childhood,
    <br>after she was used as a sacrifice to atone for the sins of her family.
    <br>We give glory to God that that curse was finally broken here at The SCOAN.
    <br>Sister, before moving ahead, we would like to ask you:
    <br>In the light of this experience, what do you want to advise our viewers all over the world?
    <br>Firstly, I would advise all viewers all over the world that the evil kingdom exists.
    <br>They want you to join them and the only way is - if you sin, you go to them.
    <br>They are also praying tirelessly for you to sin so that you will join them.
    <br>My advice is to stay away from sin.
    <br>Secondly, I have seen powers upon powers but there is a power beyond powers.
    <br>That is the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Mary
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Divinity that has residence in a human being.
    <br>The God of Prophet T.B. Joshua used Prophet T.B. Joshua to liberate me
    <br>from the kingdom of darkness to His glory.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Once again, we give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>He is the one that has liberated our sister, and it is a wonderful, very valuable lesson
    <br>that we can learn from her experience.
    <br>Physically, she was liberated from the shrine where she was living as a young girl.
    <br>She was taken out of that shrine physically
    <br>but spiritually, she was still under the torments of that evil spirits.
    <br>It was only here at The SCOAN where she finally received complete and total liberation
    <br>from her past through deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Sister, we actually have a message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Upon hearing your story and what you have passed through,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua actually used some people, made contact with some people in Ghana,
    <br>to try and locate your family home and where it is you are coming from.
    <br>You said earlier that you don't know your mother. Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you don't know your other family members?
    <br>No.
    <br>By the grace of God, through the arrangements and intervention of God's servant Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>in the Church today, we have a lady...
    <br>Mary
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>She's going to come forward right now.
    <br>She will be in the best position to explain who she is to our sister here.
    <br>Mary
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So, right now, we actually - before anything else - quickly want to hear a word from one of the ladies here.
    <br>She is one of the people that God actually used Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to bring the other family members that are here.
    <br>Sister, you are welcome.
    <br>Can you introduce yourself to us and also explain who you are to the sister that has just spoken
    <br>and who the other people are that are standing here?
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am Mrs Rebekah Emirenus, popularly known as Mama Becky.
    <br>I am from Ghana.
    <br>I am an evangelist in the Medina market. That was where I saw Mary.
    <br>She came to me one day and told me all the stories she has told us.
    <br>I told her that it was only Prophet T.B. Joshua who could deliver her
    <br>and that she should keep praying for me so that if I got money, I would sponsor her to Lagos.
    <br>That was exactly what I did two weeks ago.
    <br>I was very happy when I saw Mary being delivered.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, this is the sister that actually met our sister in Ghana
    <br>and sponsored her journey here to The SCOAN two weeks ago,
    <br>after listening to what she had passed through,
    <br>stating that she needed to seek the face of God here at The SCOAN for deliverance.
    <br>So, after her deliverance, sister, what happened? What happened next?
    <br>After the deliverance, on Tuesday, Mary called me and said that the Prophet had sent somebody
    <br>to tell me to locate her mother in the Volta region. That was my first time of boarding a boat.
    <br>I took the boat and went to look for her mother, Mama Happy.
    <br>Fortunately, when I went, she was there.
    <br>There were some people who wanted to say no
    <br>but finally, the uncle in that house said she could come with us.
    <br>That was how I brought mama to Accra.
    <br>She stayed with me on Wednesday and Thursday and then on Friday, we set off to this place.
    <br>You mean to say that the lady standing here is the mother of Mary?
    <br>That is Mama Happy, Mary's mother.
    <br>Mama, that is Mary.
    <br>Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>And the brother beside her; w|ho is he?
    <br>The brother is Kofi. Mary's brother.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Madam, you didn't know this family before then.
    <br>It was only through the deliverance of our sister that you were sent on this assignment
    <br>to locate her mother that she had not seen. Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Wednesday was the first time I saw Mama Happy.
    <br>That is Mary's mother and Kofi.
    <br>At this point, we want to hear just a quick word from our mother here
    <br>and we believe she will be speaking a local dialect, so our sister will help to translate.
    <br>Madam, you are very welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you introduce yourself to us?
    <br>Mrs Happy (Mary's Mother)
    <br>A Ghanaian living in Cote D'Ivoire
    <br>We want to ask our mother; what can she say about what she has just heard now
    <br>and does she have to say to our sister that is here?
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Mary is my daughter. I have been looking for her for many years.
    <br>Mary is her daughter. She had been looking for her. She never knew that she would ever see Mary again.
    <br>Mama, you mean to say that our sister here - you have not seen her for how many years?
    <br>Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Since she was three years old.
    <br>When Mary was three years old, she saw her last. Since then, she has not seen Mary.
    <br>So, she is seeing her for the first time here at The SCOAN after her deliverance.
    <br>Mama, we know that most of what you need to say will not be said in public,
    <br>but what do you want to say to Mary right now as she is standing here?
    <br>What do you have to say to her upon listening to her confession and seeing what she has passed through?
    <br>What do you actually want to tell her?
    <br>Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I am very happy to see Mary again.
    <br>My daughter should forgive me.
    <br>God should forgive her as she didn't do that intentionally.
    <br>She didn't know anything - It was the tradition.
    <br>God should forgive her.
    <br>So, we have heard it from our mother here. She is actually asking God for forgiveness.
    <br>She said it was the tradition of her time that actually caused her to take that decision
    <br>to actually give her little daughter to the shrine and today for the very first time, she is seeing her daughter
    <br>here in The SCOAN, after her deliverance two weeks ago.
    <br>Once, again, brethren, this is a very emotional moment.
    <br>It is difficult for the family here to comprehend exactly what has happened.
    <br>And we understand that not everything can be said and done publicly
    <br>but we are bringing this to your attention for you to know what Jesus Christ has done.
    <br>So, we can see our mother right now, begging her daughter for forgiveness after what has happened.
    <br>Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, whether victims or perpetrators,
    <br>we all stand in helpless need of the Saviour's forgiveness.
    <br>I have forgiven her.
    <br>Mary & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Hallelujah! Glory be to God Almighty!
    <br>That is the power of forgiveness.
    <br>As our sister rightly said that whether victim or perpetrator, we all stand
    <br>in helpless need of God's divine forgiveness.
    <br>Our mother here - upon hearing her confession - has realised her wrong.
    <br>She said she is asking God for forgiveness because it was traditional at that time
    <br>for her to take such an action
    <br>and she has seen the terrible repercussions in her daughter's life ever since.
    <br>We know that this is a reconciliation only God can bring about.
    <br>It is not possible ordinarily, if not for the intervention of God,
    <br>who used his servant Prophet T.B. Joshua to actually locate Mary's mother
    <br>far away in Ghana and bring her here today to reconcile with her daughter
    <br>she is seeing for the very first time in so many years.
    <br>One more time, people of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Finally, we are also seeing a young man here. We want to hear a quick word from him.
    <br>Brother, you are welcome.
    <br>I thank God for today is a big day for me.
    <br>God has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to unite the family.
    <br>I thank God for what He has done. God is our Saviour.
    <br>I give glory to the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I thank God for everything. I thank God that He is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.
    <br>I thank God because He used Prophet T.B. Joshua to bring us here today.
    <br>I give all the glory to God.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We thank God for our sister's deliverance and what you have just seen now - the reconciliation.
    <br>We pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance
    <br>by making the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>And we know that upon hearing your confession, people of God are ready to come together
    <br>to support you to start a new life in Christ; now that you have finally liberated from the shekels of satan
    <br>and indeed, as Christians, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>After her glorious testimony, reunion and reconciliation with her family,
    <br>Mary sat down to have a meal with her mother and brother
    <br>for the first time in so many years.
    <br>Let's join them at this happy occasion.
    <br>Mary & Family Eating Together 
    <br>Enjoying Each Other's Company
    <br>We thank God Almighty for this great day in my life.
    <br>We also thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV and the whole congregation
    <br>for this great deliverance in my life.
    <br>It is actually a new day and a new beginning in Christ Jesus.
    <br>I also thank Mama Becky, my Good Samaritan, for such a role that she played in my life.
    <br>There is a wise saying that says that on the road to your divine destiny,
    <br>you need to meet the right people.
    <br>I think she is the right person.
    <br>This is the first time in my life I am meeting with my family, gathered and enjoying,
    <br>eating together at a table, and I am so overjoyed.
    <br>I have forgiven her and forgiven everyone in my family, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Mary & Family Eating Together And Enjoying Each Other's Company
    <br>She is lost of words; she is singing to glorify God for bringing us together.
    <br>She is overjoyed. So, she is singing to glorify God for a great day.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>I want to tell the viewers that there are many people like Mary, who are crying -
    <br>they don't have people to talk to.
    <br>If they come to you - show them the way.
    <br>The way is Jesus Christ and nothing else. Leave everything in the hands of God.
    <br>We really congratulate this family and thank God for what He has done
    <br>in the life of this family.
    <br>We believe this is just the beginning of great things to happen in this family.
    <br>And the man of God, senior  Prophet T.B. Joshua has sent us to the family -
    <br>the mother of Mary and also the brother
    <br>and our dear madam, who God used to bring Mary to The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God has said that Mary is going to spend some more days in the presence of God,
    <br>after which, she will be joining the family again.
    <br>In the meantime, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has asked us to give the family
    <br>the sum of 100,000 Naira for their transport back to Ghana.
    <br>Mrs Happy, Mary's Mother Receiving A Cash Gift Of 100,000 Naira from Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>I thank you all.
    <br>God says, when you don't forgive your neighbour, He cannot forgive you.
    <br>I want my daughter to forgive me so that we will be at peace and live together.
    <br>I pray God will forgive me all my sins.
    <br>She is actually thanking the man of God for such a wonderful gift
    <br>that she has received from him.
    <br>Mary & Family 
    <br>Reconciled In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>The following Sunday, after sharing her life experience and being reunited with her biological mother,
    <br>Mary returned to The SCOAN to give thanks to God
    <br>for how her life had changed since her deliverance.
    <br>I was delivered from demonic slavery where I was sent to a shrine to serve an idol.
    <br>I continued living in slavery all my life from the age of one until I was delivered in The SCOAN.
    <br>I was delivered; I was liberated spiritually, materially and physically, as you can see now.
    <br>Mary
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I am here to thank the Lord Almighty for His kindness and favour,
    <br>upon my life, upon all the people and upon my family.
    <br>Last week Sunday, I was introduced to my family.
    <br>I was reunited with my family and my mother and that was the day I knew how old I was.
    <br>Now, I am thirty years old.
    <br>Mary
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>It was really surprising to learn how old I was.
    <br>It is by the grace of God Almighty.
    <br>I want to take this opportunity, viewers all over the world and people sitting in this congregation,
    <br>to thank God Almighty and thank Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for his love for humanity, the love that is radiating within his veins,
    <br>that I am enjoying today.
    <br>When I was delivered, he actually took care of me, clothed me and washed me
    <br>spiritually, physically, materially and financially.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I want to thank him.
    <br>I want to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I want to thank you for your love that you have.
    <br>As God Almighty has radiated His power within you,
    <br>you have selflessly devoted yourself to God and were used to deliver me from demonic slavery.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>I am not a Trokosi.
    <br>I am not Osu.
    <br>I am not an outcast.
    <br>I am a bonafide citizen of God, co-king with Christ, co-heir with Christ.
    <br>I am born of God through Christ Jesus by faith.
    <br>1 John 5:4-5 says that whoever is born of God overcomes the world.
    <br>This is the victory that overcomes the world - our faith.
    <br>Who is it that overcomes the world but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
    <br>I am an overcomer.
    <br>God Almighty gave birth to me through Christ Jesus by faith.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We are here this morning with a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua for our sister Mary.
    <br>We have listened to her experiences last week.
    <br>We know how she has been suffering her entire life.
    <br>Even before coming to The SCOAN, she was under this very extreme demonic influence -
    <br>unable to have a job, unable to live like a normal person in society.
    <br>But we can all testify today that she is free and we can see the glory of God shining in her life.
    <br>So, Prophet T.B. Joshua said that he wants to support you
    <br>to start a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide,
    <br>we are here today to present to you the gift of 1,500 USD.
    <br>Mary
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Mary Receives 1,500 USD From T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>The equivalent of over 600,000 Naira, which is for our sister to start a new life in Christ Jesus
    <br>now that she has been delivered from the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>People all over the world and everyone here,
    <br>help me to thank the man of God and to thank God Almighty for such an amount to start life with.
    <br>He is indeed a man of love, a man of kindness,
    <br>a man that can offer such a huge gift to me.
    <br>I had gone to many churches for this deliverance but couldn't get it
    <br>but here, I was delivered and on top of it all, I was given such an amount to start life with.
    <br>Indeed, God is with us.
    <br>Mary Receives 1,500 USD From T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua. I am happy with your gift.
    <br>I will start a new life in Christ Jesus with the money you have given me.
    <br>I know that this amount with Christ and with your prayer and your fatherly love
    <br>and people all over the world who send their love and support,
    <br>I think life is a race in a tunnel.
    <br>I pray that at the end of the tunnel, when the Saviour comes,
    <br>we all will be caught up to the final ride with Christ.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Once again, for those who may not have witnessed the experience of our sister,
    <br>or listened to the experience of our sister last week,
    <br>she said it was last week, here at The SCOAN, that she actually met and reconciled with her family -
    <br>particularly her mother - for the very first time.
    <br>We can see clips on the screen here that were taken after the service,
    <br>showing how mother and daughter sat down together and began relating and talking to each other.
    <br>Even feeding each other for the very first time in their lives.
    <br>Sister, just tell us what you can say about the reconciliation that happened here.
    <br>It was a great day for me because I was eating with my mother for the first time,
    <br>eating a sumptous meal for the first time without people giving me food,
    <br>sitting down with drinks and people around who love me.
    <br>It was just a wonderful day, a wonderful meal and a wonderful reconciliation in the Lord.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Sister, we thank God for your life. We would like to ask you finally: What would be your word of advice
    <br>based on all that Jesus Christ has done for you and all that you passed through in life?
    <br>What do you really want to advise people of God and those present here?
    <br>I would advise people all over the world to stay away from sin
    <br>because the darker world is praying tirelessly that you should sin so that they can get your soul.
    <br>The advice is to stay away from sin and close to Christ; He is the only Way, the Truth and the Light.
    <br>The greatest sacrifice has been made 2,000 years ago;
    <br>that is the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary, not human beings.
    <br>The greatest sacrifice has been made; so, make Christ your life partner, your will and your goal.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Once again, sister, we thank God for your life. We pray that God will give you the grace
    <br>to make His Word the standard for your life and we know that with the support of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide - this wonderful gift you received right now -
    <br>better is not good enough, the best is yet to come!
    <br>We know you will be coming back with more wonderful testimonies to the glory of God Almighty!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Wonderful testimonies.
