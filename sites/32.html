  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, get ready to pray with Prophet T.B. Joshua and loose yourself
    <br>from every bondage of sickness, limitation and backwardness.
    <br>Any moment from now, your health will be restored and your career released
    <br>as you pray in faith with Prophet T.B.Joshua, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, what is that bondage?
    <br>Whatever bondage, 
    <br>begin to free yourself.
    <br>Free yourself from that bondage, in the name of Jesus Christ! 
    <br>Begin to free yourself from that bondage!
    <br>Every constant experience you are having of that bondage, be loosed in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to confess your freedom!
    <br>I'm released!
    <br>My business is released!
    <br>My health is restored! My finances are released! My marital life is restored!
    <br>My career is released!
    <br>My future is released!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past!
    <br>I'm justified! I'm no longer condemned! 
    <br>Open your lips and begin to confess this!
    <br>Confess them.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ! 
    <br>Change your words and your thoughts, as a victor.
    <br>I'm justified! I'm no longer condemned! 
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past!
    <br>My health is restored!
    <br>Change your words and your thoughts.
    <br>My health has been restored!
    <br>My marital life has been restored!
    <br>My career has been released!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray!
    <br>I pray you will be sensitive to His voice and maintain your blessings.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Hallelujah!
