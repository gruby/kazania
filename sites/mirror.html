Author comment.</br>
God chooses the grace rather than works <a name="CB_ep_2_8_9"></a>(<a href="#ep_2_8_9">Ep 2v8-9</a>). This means if the weak come to Him HE would help their weakness just as HE would help the strong. God knows we are weak. That is why HE chooses grace. 
If God had chosen works rather than grace man would have the autonomy to choose whom to help with his works and how to do his works. The battle would be for the strongest – leaving no room for people like me (TB Joshua)
The race would be for the strongest leaving no room for people like me (TB Joshua).

DEDICATION</br></br>
This book is dedicated to all children of God who are fighting without but filled with fear within. Elisha said to his servant: “ ‘Do not fear, for those who are with us more than those who are with them’.” <a name="CD_2KINGS 6:16"></a><a href="#2KINGS 6:16">2 KINGS 6:16 NKJV</a> </br></br>
Nevertheless, I say to you that those that are fighting for you, protecting you and taking care of you are more than the forces of the adversary.</br></br>
As you read this book, I pray for you as Elisha prayed for his servant: “Lord Jesus, open their understanding, so they will doubt no more, worry and fear no more. Open their hearts to faith, in Your holy name we pray. Amen.”</br></br>

INTRODUCTION </br>
God’s generals in this book mirror God and we see in them the image and likeness of God. They are men and women of faith who share in the authority and power of our God over all forms of satanic oppression:</BR></BR>
“I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.” <kolor>LUKE 10:19</kolor></BR></BR>
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, is disappointed that men lack the necessary faith to release the power that has been given them. 
</p>
<a name="ABRAHAM"></a>
<a href="#MENU_EN">UP</a>
<h1>Abraham</h1></br>
GENESIS 22:1-18</BR>
<p>
<kolor>Our duty is to obey God’s instructions. His duty is to keep His promise.</kolor></br></br>
“Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, ‘Abraham!’ ‘Here I am’ he replied. Then God said, ‘Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.’ …Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, ‘Abraham! Abraham!’ ‘Here I am,’ he replied. ‘Do not lay a hand on the boy,’ he said. ‘Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son’.” <kolor>GENESIS 22:1-2, 10-12</kolor></BR></br>
Father Abraham did not allow his love for Isaac, his only son, to affect his relationship with God, knowing that the purpose of his own life was beyond his love for Isaac. The pain of sacrificing his only son did not affect his relationship with God. He knew that the purpose of life was beyond the pain and joy of life. When you glorify the Creator rather than the created, you live each day to overcome. I mean, you will live about above human destruction.</BR></br>
Imagine what would have happened to Abraham if he had waited for more convenient time to carry out God’s instruction. We know it was not convenient to Abraham to sacrifice his only son – Isaac, just as it is not convenient to anyone to give out the only possession he has.</br></br>
“Then God said, ‘Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.’” <kolor>GENESIS 22:2</kolor></BR></br>
The bible says, “whom you love” (not “whom you hate”). You know you have many children. There are some of your children of whom you would say, “I don’t want to hear about that boy. He’s a troublemaker. He’s stubborn.”</br></br>
Suppose Abraham had waited for a more convenient day to carry out God’s instruction, what would have happened to him? As we know, it was not convenient for him to take his only beloved son for sacrifice, as it is not convenient for anyone to take his only beloved son for sacrifice. If Abraham’s belief did not see beyond Isaac, he would not have had the courage to obey God’s instruction. You need to remember that <kolor>our duty is to obey God’s instructions. His duty is to keep His promise</kolor>. The way of obedience is the way of blessing.</br></br>
The expression, “Here I am”, means, “I am all Yours”. “Your will is my command.” “Lord I am committed to You, whatever You ask me, I will do” (see <kolor>GENESIS 22:1</kolor>).</br></br>
If you were sent to unpleasant places, would you go? Abraham was ready to carry out not only pleasant instructions but also painful ones. Are you, however, ready to go to unpleasant places today? I mean a place of sacrifice. People want to go to places of reward rather than of sacrifice. Today, people show less interest for things of the Spirit, which cannot be quantified in terms of position, money and physical reward. Placed in the same condition as Abraham, you would likely say, “Here I am, send me, but how much will You give me?” You would want to know how much money, position or any other physical reward you would gain after carrying out the instructions.</br></br>
Listen to Abraham: “Here I am; I am all Yours. Your will is my command; I am committed to You, Lord. Whatever You ask me to do, I will do.”</br></br>
He was not saying he would be ready only to follow pleasant instructions; whether pleasant or painful, he was ready. When I say I have faith in God, I mean I have confidence in Him; I believe in Him; I obey all His commands, I mean I am committed to Him, I know Him.</br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
Ask God to fill your heart with the Spirit of obedience, in Jesus’ name.</br></br>
Say, “Lord, I am ready to your do will and to obey Your Words. Jesus, I want to be a doer of Your Words, in Your holy name.”</br></br>
Lord Jesus, I am giving up to Your will.</br>
I have given up to Your will.</br>
I am ready to go wherever You want me to go; </br>
to say whatever You want me to say; </br>
to be whatever You want me to be. </br>
I am ready Lord; I am ready now! </br>
The time is short – the world is coming to an end. </br>
I don’t want to waste my time. </br>
I am ready to evangelise Your message, </br>
all over the world, by myself, if necessary. </br>
I’m ready; I’m ready now – let’s go God! </br></br>

STUDY QUESTIONS</br></br>
<kolor>ONE//</kolor> In any true relationship, each party should be ready to make some sacrifice in order to keep the relationship going. What sacrifice are you making in order to maintain your relationship with Jesus?</br></br>
<kolor>TWO//</kolor> What made Abraham say, “… I and my boy will go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you…” if he knew that he had to sacrifice Isaac? (see <kolor>GENESIS 22:5</kolor>)</br></br>
<kolor>THREE//</kolor> The cost of disobedience is far greater than the cost of obedience. What would have happened if Abraham had not obeyed God’s instruction?</br></br>

<p>
GENESIS 37,39-42</br></br>
<kolor>When you are conscious of your dream, whatever the situation and whatever happens on the outside will not matter to you.</kolor></br></br>
“Now Joseph had a dream, and he told it to his brothers; and they hated him even more. So he said to them, ‘Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.’ And his brothers said to him, ‘Shall you indeed reign over us? Or shall you indeed have dominion over us? So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.” <kolor>GENESIS 37:5-8 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
Sometimes you see people are happy, whereas there is nothing to be happy about on the outside. This is because they have a dream, which is known to them alone. This was the case with Joseph.</br></br> 
“So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colours that was on him. Then they took him and cast him into a pit. And the pit was empty; there was no water in it.” <kolor>GENESIS 37:23-24 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
Even when he was right in the pit, he was not overwhelmed by sadness, fear or doubts. His condition in the dry pit could not derail him because his focus was on his dream, not on the pit condition.</br></br>
“So Joseph found favour in his sight, and served him. Then he made him overseer of his house, and all that he had he put under his authority. So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house and in the field.” <kolor>GENESIS 39:4-5 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
Even when he was in Pothiphar’s house where he was well cared for, his focus remained on his dream. While he was enjoying all the favours, he still believed that his dream was greater than his present enjoyment.</br></br>
“Then Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison.” <kolor>GENESIS 39:20 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
Then he went to jail. While in prison, his focus was on his dream, not on his prison condition. Many today are overwhelmed by the situation around them because they do not focus on their dreams. When you are conscious of your dream, whatever the situation and whatever happens on the outside will not matter to you.</br></br>
Remember, we do not look at what is seen but what is unseen, for what is seen is temporary while what is unseen is permanent. As children of God, we walk by faith, not by sight. We therefore are not overwhelmed by what is seen. Joseph was in the prison but he did not allow the prison conditions to overwhelm him. Instead, he looked through the window, saw beautiful skies and gave thanks to God, and said, “Thank you, Jesus!” He never looked down. <kolor>Getting you to look at life, its storms and adversities from the human point of view is a trap from satan.</kolor> I mean looking at your situation from the human point of view (i.e., on the outside), will give you discouragements, fear, doubt and anxiety.</br></br>
Joseph had a dream when he was very small. He saw stars bow before him (see <kolor>GENESIS 37:9</kolor>). That was the dream he followed; that was his focus. He held onto that ever since. Whatever the situation, the Bible says, Joseph always said to himself, “This is not where I belong.” The future I desire is a beautiful picture. My words must be the photograph of that future I desire. My action, behaviour, way of life and everything about me must be the photograph of the future I desire.</br></br>
Each time Joseph found himself in a place, which was contrary to his vision, he would say to himself, “I know where I belong – not here!” When he was in the dry pit, he said to himself, “I know where I belong – not here!” That imparted into him the strength to endure the condition in the dry pit. When he found himself in prison, he said to himself, “I know where I belong – not here!” That imparted into him the strength to endure the condition of the prison. When he found himself in the situation of condemnation, where Potiphar’s wife was trying to tempt him, the Bible says, he had three reasons why he did not yield to the temptation of Potiphar’s wife:</br></br>
<kolor>ONE//</kolor> he considered who he was</br>
<kolor>TWO//</kolor> he was a covenant child, and,</br>
<kolor>THREE//</kolor> he was a child with the promise of God.</br></br>
If you are a man of vision, you will be able to know where you belong. Indeed, you should be able to know where you belong! When Joseph found himself in the dry pit, he said to himself, “This is not God’s promise. Where I am going, there is something greater. I know where I belong – not here!” The Bible says, he continued to endure. <kolor>Remember, our trouble becomes easier to handle when we know that it will not last long.</kolor> He knew that he would be in a dry pit for a short time. Whatever the trouble was, it would be for a short time. When he was in the prison he knew the condition there was for a short time.</br></br>
If you know where you belong, why do you complain? Why do you fight? Why do you have time for every unnecessary question? Why? Why do you bother about what people say about you? Why do you turn into a beggar when you know where you belong?</br></br>
Joseph knew where he belonged. If it were not so, he would have thought he would die in the dry pit. He would have fallen into self-pity. “Why God? Why me? Why me!” As he knew where he belonged, he looked around and said, “I know where I belong – not here! I will not die. I shall live to see the glory of God!” He was going to the throne.</br></br> 
If he had had no dream, he would have died in the dry pit. When he was in the dry pit, he said to himself, “This is not where I belong.” You can be content, no matter what happens to you on the outside. Whatever happens on the outside does not determine whether or not you have a contented life.</br></br>
When God puts something in your mind, the circumstances, what people say or what happens around you, cannot change your mind. Remember, it was what God put in Joseph’s mind that was his focus when he was in the dry pit, in the prison yard and in Potiphar’s house.</br></br>
God sometimes uses hard times to draw us to Himself, so that we can take our proper position and possession in Him. For instance, at the time Joseph had the dream of his future, he was too young to appreciate the glory that was ahead of him – how he would become the prime minister. I mean if he had become the prime minister earlier than he did in Egypt, he would have been too inexperienced to handle the position. So, the hard times we went through in the dry pit, it Potiphar’s house and in the prison, were God’s own way of preserving him for the glory ahead. If Joseph had not been in the prison, he would not had the contact that finally linked him to the throne in Egypt. It was in these dark periods of his life that he gained the necessary experience and maturity to handle the responsibilities imposed on him by the exalted position he occupied in the royal court in Egypt. From this, we can understand that God sometimes uses hard times – that is, unpleasant situations – to preserve us so that we can take our future in our hands.</br></br>
“Joseph said to them, ‘Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God? But as for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, in order to bring it about as it is this day, to save many people alive’.” <kolor>GENESIS 50:19-20 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
Sometimes God allows poverty so that you can take your proper position and possession. Suffering, sickness and loneliness can preserve one. <kolor>God visits His people with hard times so that they may learn His way.</kolor> His way, though hard to the ungodly man, is desirable and profitable because it leads us to safety and eternal life.</br></br>
Remember, if we go through hard times, we will be able to recognize and appreciate freedom. Your toiling, struggling and working hard may be to make you see and appreciate freedom when it finally comes.</br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
When Joseph was in the dry pit, he kept saying, “This is not where I belong.” He was able to endure that dry pit. You have lost focus, that is why poverty can make you cry. God will bring that revelation back. When you have a revelation, you will be content. As a result of this dream, he was able to withstand the situation in the dry pit and in the prison.</br></br>
All you need are His mercy and favour. Do you want a good life? You must believe. The future you desire does not permit you to doubt or fear.</br></br>
Ask God to give you the words of the future you desire, in Jesus’ name. </br></br>
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, receive the future you desire!</br></br>

<h1>David</h1>
<p>
SAMUEL 17:32-52</br></br>
<kolor>It was God’s Word, which came out of David’s lips, that produced an overcoming spirit in him.</kolor></br></br>
“David said to the Philistine, ‘You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I’ll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole word will know that there is a God in Israel. All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD’s and He will give all of you into our hands’.” 
<kolor>I SAMUEL 17:45-47</kolor></br></br>
David spoke the Word of Faith and the giant fell. Faith acts on God’s Word. It believes now; it receives now; it acts now. When we take God at His Word, that Word will stand good in the trial. God’s Word is Spirit; it is light where there is darkness, an understanding where there is ignorance and an awareness of righteousness where there is sin. It shows us who we were, who we are and who we shall be. It shows us the mercy and justice of the Lord and, above all, the joys of salvation and the agony of hell. A Christian must speak the Word of Faith at all times (see <kolor>COLOSSIANS 4:6</kolor>).</br></br> 
It was God’s Word, which came out of David’s lips, that produced an overcoming spirit in him. He spoke the Word of Faith and the giant fell. Victory is in our faith.</br></br>
Confess what you believe and believe what you confess. Righteousness is for all that believe in their hearts that Jesus is the Saviour. Victory is for all that believe in their hearts that Jesus is the Redeemer. Imagine what would have happened if David had not spoken the Word of Faith in his encounter with Goliath. Imagine the destruction he would have invited to himself and the people of Israel;</br></br>
<kolor>ONE//</kolor> God would not have heard him</br>
<kolor>TWO//</kolor> he would have been destroyed in the hands of Goliath, and, </br>
<kolor>THREE//</kolor> the people of Israel would have been routed. </br></br>
If he had not spoked the Word of Faith, his word would have been not only idle but also very destructive. His people looked on to see what would become of small David after his encounter with Goliath. Among them were his relations, friends, enemies as well as those who believed in him and those who did not; they were all watching to see the outcome of his faith. Now at the battlefield, if what David spoke with his mouth was not what he believed in his heart, one could only imagine what would have become of him when he was face to face with a giant. His word would have been idle, meaningless and, at that point destructive. When you are face to face with Jesus, HE is not interested in your attire, position, size or your political and economic power. I mean HE is not interested in your power on the outside but in your faith because faith is what makes you one with Him. Jesus said, “If you have faith in Me, these works that I do, you will do also – even more” (see <kolor>JOHN 14:12</kolor>). </br></br>
This means with faith, His power, ability and strength become yours – that is what makes you one with Him.</br></br>
<kolor>Faith:</kolor> with faith, you are justified; you are no longer condemned. <kolor>With faith, the mountain of guilt which has separated you from God will be removed, thus making you one with Him – thus making you a child of God.</kolor> </br></br>
If David were not a man of faith, he would have considered the size of the giant and he would been intimidated be the size and armour of his adversary. Remember, the giant was better armed than David was in the physical. Apart from his size, Goliath had a spear, javelin, machete and a shield as against the small David, barely armed, with a sample sling. Remember, his own people doubted him; that was why they went to the king. </br></br>
If David were to look at the intimidating size of Goliath, he would have given in to the giant’s threats. In the physical, Goliath was better armed and experienced in matters of warfare.</br></br> 
On the outside, Goliath created a feeling of intimidation and fear in people – this was the weapon he carried; but David, as a man of faith, triumphed over him because his weapon was on the inside. David’s ability was on the inside – it was the power of God. This is what is meant by: “In our hearts we believe; with our mouths we confess.”</br></br>
Power on the outside (this is, intimidation and threats) was the weapon of Goliath but David’s weapon was on the inside. There was power in his mouth; the belief in his heart was released by faith out of his mouth:</br></br>
“David said to the Philistine, ‘You came against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied’.” <kolor>I SAMUEL 17:45</kolor></br></br>
David spoke the Words of Faith and the giant fell. This means David spoke with his mouth what he believed in his heart. <kolor>It takes faith to achieve victory. After the victory is won, anyone can shout, “Hallelujah!” “Amen!” “Hosanna!”</kolor></br></br>
“David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine’s sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and run. Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistinians to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron…” <kolor>I SAMUEL 17:51-52</kolor></br></br>
It did not take his people any faith, to shout, “Thank You,” when the giant fell. So also, anyone can shout after a miracle has happened but it takes faith to shout before the miracle happens. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
In the natural, David could not withstand the giant because the giant was mighty in nature and mighty in body. David was very small. This shows that we are not fighting a natural situation. A believer who operates in the natural has not power.</br></br> 
By the power that gave victory to David, the Lord should give you victory, in Jesus’ name!</br></br>
Continue to speak the Word of Faith to your giant, “Move it the mighty name of Jesus Christ!”</br></br>
STUDY QUESTIONS</br></br>
<kolor>ONE//</kolor> Imagine that you were in the position of David where those in authority, your colleagues and even your brothers, did not believe in you. Would you allow their opinions to change your opinion of yourself?</br></br>
<kolor>TWO//</kolor> Giants cannot kill you but the fear of giants can (see <kolor>JUDGES 7:12-22</kolor>). What is your giant? Is it sickness, anxiety, poverty or setback? Remember, if David had considered the size of the giant, he would have been scared to submission. How are you looking at your present situation? </br></br>
<kolor>THREE//</kolor> David spoke the Words of Faith and the giant fell. When you are faced with a giant – sickness, trial, crisis, temptation, etc., what kind of words do you use?</br></br>
<kolor>FOUR//</kolor> David acknowledged God for all HE had done for him in the past. Do you still acknowledge God? Do you acknowledge His goodness when you were yet small, when you were in your mother’s womb (see <kolor>I SAMUEL 17:37</kolor>) ?</br></br>

<h1>The Shunammite woman</h1>
<p>
<kolor>It does not take long to realise that Jesus believes what you say is important.</kolor></br></br>
“Please run now to meet her, and say to her, ‘Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child’? And she answered, ‘It is well’. “ <kolor>2 KINGS 4:26 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
A dead child was being kept in the room but she answered, “Everything is alright – it is well.” And when you read the passage further, you will see that it was alright indeed – it was well indeed. </br></br>
What you say before meeting a man of God sometimes becomes true after meeting him.</br></br>
God needs to grant you the grace to speak His Word with boldness. You need to speak the Words of God with boldness. The Psalmist says, “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil…” <kolor>PSALM 23:4</kolor></br></br>
“It is well with me. It is well and so shall it be.” When you look at the book of <kolor>2 KINGS 4:20</kolor>, the only child that this woman had, died. The woman kept the child in the room and went to meet Prophet Elisha. On her way, she met the servant and the servant said, “What is happening to you, madam? How is your son? How is your husband? How are you?” Instead of saying, “My only child died”, she simply said to the servant, “It is well,” and it was well indeed. </br></br>
<kolor>There is power in your mouth. The belief in your heart is released by faith out of your mouth.</kolor> It does not take long to realise that Jesus believes what you say is important. Your words will either justify of condemn you. You shall account for the words spoken by your mouth (see <kolor>MATTHEW 12:36-37</kolor>). If they are not according to the truth of God’s Word, they will be idle, meaningless and oftentimes destructive. What a person says with his mouth can either release or obstruct the passage of what he believes in his heart.</br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
Whenever it looks like things are working against you, start confessing the Words of Faith. Learn to say, “It is well”, and it shall be well, in Jesus’ name. Amen.</br></br>
If the evidence of what you believe is your faith in God’s Word, receive more now! Believe now and act now, in Jesus’ name.</br></br>

<h1>JOB</h1>
<p>
JOB 1:18-22</BR></BR>
<kolor>Your belief should be based on something beyond your present situation. </kolor></br></br>
“While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, ‘Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am only one who has escaped to tell you!’ At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship and said: ‘Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised,’ In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.” <kolor>JOB 1:18-22</kolor></br></br>
Assuming his confidence was based on wealth, position, power, might and children (these physical things), he would have lost his confidence when they were taken from him. His confidence remained even stronger without them because it was born of faith. </br></br>
Job’s belief saw beyond his earthly possessions that were destroyed – his children, cattle and camels. Even all his body was full of sores. If his belief did not see beyond his possessions, he would not have had the courage or hope to be firm in his faith. The Bible says he was firm. If he had seen his possessions as the basis of his relationship with God, he would not have had anything to rest his faith when they were taken away. But he did not count on his possessions or social relations as the basis of his relationship with God (see <kolor>JOB 1:20</kolor>). Job’s belief was based on something beyond the sores and boils that covered his skin. Your belief should be based on something beyond your present situation. </br></br>
The Bible says that Job did not blame God for his situation; rather, he was ready to die. This means he saw his hard times as a reason for believing in God, just as he had seen good times as a reason for believing in God as well. </br></br>
<kolor>In our weakness, the strength of God quickens and energizes us.</kolor> Can you see the reason why you must relax in times of trouble? Jesus is aware of your problem; HE will not leave you without a solution. HE is aware of your sickness; HE will not leave you without healing you. HE is aware of your poverty; HE will not leave you without blessings. When you are doing the right thing and are persecuted, Jesus is aware. Jesus is aware of your complaints; HE is aware of your yoke. HE will not leave you without freedom. As Jesus is aware of your injustice, HE will not leave you without justice. </br></br>
Therefore, be happy because Jesus is aware of every trial and every insult you receive from people as well as every problem, every difficulty and every crisis you face for righteousness’ sake. </br></br>

<h1>Daniel</h1>
<p>
DANIEL 6:1-28</BR></BR>
<kolor>Daniel’s trial did not make him lose faith in God, rather it made him pray the more. </kolor></br></br>
“Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had  done before.” <kolor>DANIEL 6:10</kolor></br></br>
When the decree was published, Daniel still went to the upper room and prayed louder than before. Can you see his faith? Daniel was a man of prayer; that was why they made the decree. The law of Medes and Persians said that if anyone was caught praying in the name of the God of Israel, he or she would be killed. That is the kind of faith we are talking about. Why was Daniel still praying? He knew his God was the God that saves and rescues. </br></br>
Before you show your faith, you must know your God as One that saves and rescues; you must know what you need Him to be. Before you can have faith in your God, you must first believe in Him alone and then trust in Him alone. You don’t need to support God to do His work. Our duty is to have faith in His finished works. We try to support God when we combine Him with other gods. If Daniel had bowed down before another god, which would they have accepted as a state God? Which God would have taken the glory?</br></br>
Daniel’s experience of hard times was to be in the lion’s den. The Bible says he had a look of faith at his situation as he was being led into the lion’s den, and saw redemption and freedom. Such is a man of faith. He looked beyond his immediate situation unto redemption and freedom. He had no wound on him and felt no pain because of his belief. He believed in God and was saved from the plots of his adversary.</br></br>
We should trust in God in every trial. In the hour of adversity, we should trust in God. For the reason that Daniel trusted in God in his hour of adversity, <kolor>his God became known all over, all the earth trembled before his God and his God was known as the God who rescues and delivers.</kolor> </br></br>
When will you show your belief? Today, Christians believe in God but not the times of trial. 
They believe only when everything is going fine, when everyone is speaking well of them. When you are afraid, your god will be a god of fear. When you are in doubt during your crisis, your god will be a god of doubts. However, when you believe in God in your crisis, your God will be the God that rescues. </br></br>
For the fact that he believed in God, Daniel was stronger than he was before he went into his crisis. What made him stronger?</br></br>
<kolor>ONE//</kolor> His status was elevated.</br>
<kolor>TWO//</kolor> He began to dine with kings and men of substance; King Darius began to recognise him.</br>
<kolor>THREE//</kolor> His faith became a state one: the whole country said, “The God of Daniel, everybody should worship, obey and respect!” A “state one” means the God that everyone believes in. </br>
<kolor>FOUR//</kolor> His relationship with God shifted to another level. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
Daniel was conscious of his faith even under pressure and tension.</br></br>
Ask God to give you the grace to be conscious of your faith even under pressure and tension, in the mighty name of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. </br></br>
Are you ready for prayer? We shall call the God of Daniel, the God that delivers at the point of need. Daniel needed God and the Lord rescued him. We shall call the God of Daniel to answer us by fire. God of Daniel! HE is the God that delivers at the point of need! Continue to call the God of Daniel, in Jesus’ name.</br></br>
Be thou delivered, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</br></br> 
Thou power of deliverance, fall upon you, in Jesus’ name! Fall upon your spirit, soul and body, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ! Thou power of freedom, fall upon you!</br></br>
Jesus is now fighting for you as HE fought for Daniel in the lion’s den. HE is now fighting for you as HE fought for Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the furnace. </br></br>
Ask Him to fight for you. Say to Him, “Fight for me now, Lord, in Your holy name!”</br></br>
God gave victory to Daniel in the lion’s den. </br></br>
“Oh Lord, by Your name, Jehovah Nissi, give me victory, in Your holy name!” </br></br>

“When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, ‘Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.’ Simon answered, ‘Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.’ When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. So they signalled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, ‘Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!’ “ <kolor>LUKE 5:4-8</kolor></br></br>

What was the instruction given to him? “Simon, put down the nets for a catch.” That was the instruction from Jesus. </br></br>
The expression, “for a catch” shows the certainty and assurance of Jesus. The word, “certainty”, means that Jesus was not guessing at all. HE was sure of what HE was saying. HE knew HE would not fail. Today, when the man of God says, “In the name of Jesus, be blessed”, it is an assurance that God can bless through him. When the man of God says, “In the name of Jesus, be healed”, it is an assurance that God can heal through him. </br></br>
In this case, Jesus spoke the Word of assurance and Peter believed and took Jesus at His Word. If the man of God says, “Be blessed in Jesus’ name”, would you believe it would be done? This is the question now. It is not just all up to the man of God – you have a role to play. Your belief, your faith, also counts. It was not just all up to Jesus. When Jesus said to him, “Put down the nets for a catch”, as a free moral agent, Peter had the right to say, “Thank You; I don’t want to do that. I’m not interested; after all, I have toiled all night without a catch”.</br></br>
“ ‘Lord, if it’s you, ‘Peter replied, ‘tell me to come to you on the water.’ ‘Come,’ he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came towards Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, ‘Lord, save me!’ Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. ‘You little faith, ‘he said, ‘why did you doubt?” <kolor>MATTHEW 14:28-31</kolor></br></br>
Your obedience is the only proof of your faith in Him. Peter did what he had never done before. You can say you have faith, but without your obedience (faith in action) there is no proof. What is meaning of the word, “faith”? The meaning is obedience. Christians must have faith in Christ Jesus because a Christian’s life comes from Christ Himself. The reward for obedience will show if we truly have faith in Jesus. What is the reward of obedience? What is the reward for faith in your Master? The reward is when you are able to do what HE is doing. Jesus said: “I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.” <kolor>JOHN 14:12</kolor></br></br>
Peter had the genuine desire to do the impossible, to reach the unreachable, so he cried out to Jesus. Jesus saw his faith and said, “Come!” Peter showed his faith as someone who wanted to come to Jesus. Jesus was on the sea. When HE saw Peter’s faith, HE said, “Come!” HE did not see only Peter, HE saw Peter’s faith. It is one thing to see you but it is another thing to see your faith. Jesus can see you without faith but you will not be blessed. HE will not bless you without faith. HE will not protect you without faith. 
“Then Peter said, ‘Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk’. “ <kolor>ACTS 3:6</kolor></br></br>
What Peter possessed was what he gave out: “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.” No one can say, “In the name of Jesus Christ” or “Jesus is Lord” without the help of the Holy Spirit. What Peter possessed was the Holy Spirit. Remember, the Bible says <kolor>when we accept Jesus as our Lord and personal Saviour, we have the very presence of God in our hearts through the Holy Spirit</kolor>. The Holy Spirit is another Comforter. Jesus was the first Comforter. In the absence of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit was to be sent (see <kolor>JOHN 14:16-18</kolor>). </br></br>
So, what we need in our lives is the Holy Spirit to make us effective for Christ Jesus. What Peter possessed was the name, Jesus Christ, through the Holy Spirit. One can possess the name, Jesus Christ, through the Holy Spirit and give out the name, Jesus Christ, through the same Holy Spirit. Peter believed in Jesus and possessed Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit. When you possess Him (Jesus Christ), you will do things through Him. </br></br>
“Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.” <kolor>JOHN 7:38</kolor></br></br>
“Within him” means innermost being (i.e., heart). Christ Jesus describes the Holy Spirit as rivers of living water that flow out of the believer’s innermost being. Peter believed in Jesus and possessed Him. How do we possess Jesus? <kolor>We possess Jesus Christ when we possess His character because God’s Word reflects His character</kolor>. Your word reflects your character. If you are a thief, your characteristics are killing, stealing and destruction. What are the characteristics of Jesus? The characteristics of Jesus are the characteristics of the Holy Spirit (see <kolor>GALATIANS 5:22-23</kolor>). </br></br>
The Bible refers to satan as the father of lies – the thief of our comfort and blessing, the killer and the destroyer of life. If you tell lies, you are speaking your father’s language, for satan is the father of lies (see <kolor>JOHN 8:44</kolor>). If you kill, you are doing your father’s job, for satan is a killer: he is the author of killing. His diseases are the destroyers of life. His sicknesses are the thieves of happiness, health, money, time and effort. If you steal, you are doing your father’s job, for satan is the thief of joy, peace and comfort. If you destroy, you are doing your father’s job, for satan is a destroyer. The thief comes simply to kill, steal and destroy (see <kolor>JOHN 10:10</kolor>).</br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
Peter wanted to come to Jesus. Jesus saw Peter’s faith as someone who wanted to come to Him and Jesus told him to “Come!”</br></br>
I want you to show your faith right now. </br>
Show your faith!</br>
The Lord wants to see your desire to get free, to get saved and to be blessed. Jesus saw Peter’s desire to come to Him on the water and HE said to him, “Come!”</br></br>
Say, “Lord Jesus, give me the grace to have a genuine desire, in Your holy name.”</br></br>
When Peter said, “Walk”, he spoke life. </br></br>
Right now, ask Jesus, our Saviour, to start speaking life unto your life and unto everything that has to do with you, in His name! </br></br>
God sometimes uses foolish things to preserve us. </br></br>
Ask God to use whatever situation you are in to preserve you, in Jesus’ name.</br></br>

MARK 2:2-12</br></br>
<kolor>Faith can make the impossible possible</kolor>.</br></br>
“So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four to them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralysed man way laying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, ‘Son, your sins are forgiven’. “ <kolor>MARK 2:2-5</kolor></br></br>
Jesus can notice you by faith. Jesus can see you by faith. Jesus can recognise you by faith. You can be attended to, recognised, noticed and appreciated by faith. When Jesus saw their faith, HE blessed and healed him.</br></br> 
<kolor>ONE//</kolor> Four men’s faith enabled them to reach the unreachable. </br>
<kolor>TWO//</kolor> Four men’s faith did what no man had ever done.</br>
<kolor>THREE//</kolor> Four men’s faith achieved what no man had ever achieved.</br>
<kolor>FOUR//</kolor> Four men’s faith made impossible possible.</br>
<kolor>FIVE//</kolor> Four men’s faith made a way where there was no way.</br></br>
Faith can make a way where there seems to be no way. Faith can make streams through dry valleys. Thus, faith can make the impossible possible. </br></br>
Four men could not get to Jesus, but their faith could – through the valley of the shadow of death; through the impossible and through the unreachable. With faith, all things are possible. There was a barrier. The barrier here was the crowd but with faith, they reached Jesus by lowering the crippled man through the roof. </br></br>
Jesus wants to see you do what no one has ever done. HE wants to see you make a way where there seems to be no way. HE wants to see you do what the ordinary man cannot. What is impossible for man, Jesus wants to see you do by faith. HE wants you to show your faith. Jesus saw Peter’s faith and made him walk on water by giving a simple command for Peter to do what he had never done before (see <kolor>MATTHEW 14:29</kolor>). HE said, “Come”, and when Peter had come out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. <kolor>Our obedience is the only proof of our faith in Him. </kolor></br></br>

<h1>The man at the pool of Bethesda</h1>
<p>
JOHN 5:1-15</br></br>
<kolor>Believing in Christ Jesus redeems our time.</kolor></br></br>
“Here a great number of disabled people used to lie – the blind, the lame, the paralysed. One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, ‘Do you want to get well?’ ‘Sir,’ the invalid replied, ‘I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.’ Then Jesus said to him, ‘Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.’ At once the man was cured; he picked his mat and walked ….” <kolor>JOHN 5:3-9</kolor></br></br>
The man at the pool of Bethesda was there helpless for many years. Imagine a crippled man, struggling to enter the pool for many years. Imagine the hazards of the weather conditions. Remember, when it was raining or sunny, he was there. </br></br>
When it was raining, it was extremely cold. When it was sunny, it was extremely hot and he was always there. He waited for God’s appointed time. At God’s appointed time, he was healed without any personal effort. <kolor>You will be healed today. You will be free today. You will be delivered today, without any personal effort.</kolor> </br></br>
When he was looking for someone to carry him inside the pool, no one appeared. The Bible says, each time the angel of God stirred the waters, other people jumped into the pool. The crippled man was there, helplessly looking, listening to the testimonies of other people. He was not discouraged. If the man looked on the outside, he could have considered many things. What about all the healing he had seen? What about the other people who stepped into the water before him? What about those who were healed but had not been there as long as he had been? He could have said: “I’m going to the native doctor!” He  could have given up. He had nobody to help him into the pool but that was looking on the outside. When you look on the outside of your situation, it becomes bigger than what you can handle, leading to fear, worry and anxiety. </br></br>
If he was influenced by the happenings around, he would have given up. However, he maintained his calm for many years – under rainfall, sunshine, cold nights, mosquito bites, etc. Can someone who runs after Jesus for selfish reasons keep pressing under these kinds of conditions? The answer is NO! He kept pressing because he saw beyond his travails. </br></br>
He believed that if only he could dip himself into the pool, he would be made whole. While waiting by the side of the pool, the Bible says, he heard many testimonies. Many others were healed in his presence. He was there lying with no one to help him but he was not discouraged. He saw many miracles happen to many others but there was one thing he believed in – God’s time. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
Today is your encounter with Jesus. Jesus is on His way to you – HE is coming purposely for you. HE is only moment away.</br></br> 
Say, “Lord Jesus Christ, let Your mighty power be released into my body today, in Your holy name!”</br></br>
STUDY QUESTIONS</br></br>
<kolor>ONE//</kolor> There were other lame and paralysed people there that had received their healing. Why did this particular man spent 38 years beside the pool of Bethesda?</br></br>
<kolor>TWO//</kolor> Jesus could obviously see that the man was in a miserable state. Why then did HE ask him, “Do you want to get well?”</br></br>

<a name="THE CENTURION"></a>
<a href="#MENU_EN">UP</a>
<h1>The centurion</h1>
<p>
MATTHEW 8:5-13</br></br>
<kolor>The centurion acknowledged his position as a sinner in need of salvation. </kolor></br></br>
“Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him, saying, ‘Lord, my servant is laying at home paralysed, dreadfully tormented.’ And Jesus said to him.’ ‘I will come and heal him.’ The centurion answered and said, ‘Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.’ When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!’ “ <kolor>MATTHEW 8:5-10 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
When we come to God in any form, HE sees beyond our appearance. If a man speaks, Jesus knows whether his intent is merely to flatter or to speak what he truly believes in his heart. We know what men do but Jesus knows the designs of their hearts. In the case of the Centurion, Jesus did not base His judgement on the Centurion’s open confession of His Lordship over all earthy authorities but on the disposition of his heart. </br></br>
<kolor>To honour God is to acknowledge our position as one underserving of His presence.</kolor> To acknowledge our position is to admit our weakness, our shortcoming, before Him. The Centurion was the leader of the battalion of soldiers, a war general. Yet he acknowledged his position before our Lord Jesus Christ when he said, “…’Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof…’. “ <kolor>MATTHEW 8:8 NKJV</kolor> He acknowledged his position as a sinner in need of salvation. How do we acknowledge our position? We do so by coming unto God in humility and sincerity of heart. </br></br>
Let us see how Jesus feels when we come in sincerity and humility of mind, when we admit our position, when we admit our weakness and when we acknowledge our position as sinners. </br></br>
“When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!’ “ <kolor>MATTHEW 8:10 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
HE marveled. When you admit your weakness in sincerity and humility of mind, not just on the outside but one the inside, Jesus does not only marvel, HE is also happy to receive you with compassion. </br></br>
Jesus Christ has authority over the devil and his agents that steal, kill and destroy. The Centurion was telling Jesus, “I am a man of authority on the outside, but You are a man of authority on the inside. Greater is HE that is with us than he that is one outside, so I submit.” Why did the Centurion come to Jesus? He came to Jesus because he was looking for him that had all authority over the devil. His physical instruments of war as a general had failed and he said: “I know You have the authority to tell this sickness to go, and it will go.”</br></br>
Jesus told him to go home and his servant was healed that hour. This demonstrates the power in the spoken word:</br></br>
“ ‘…But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed’.” <kolor>MATTHEW 8:8 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
The Bible says, HE sent forth His Word and healed them, saved them, delivered them and set them free (see <kolor>PSALM 107:20</kolor>). The Centurion knew this. That was why he asked Jesus to speak a Word and his servant was healed indeed. </br></br>
“Then Jesus said to the centurion, ‘Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.’ And his servant was healed that same hour.” <kolor>MATTHEW 8:13 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
<kolor>The authority of Jesus is not limited by space and time.</kolor> Distance is not a barrier to the authority of our Lord and our Saviour; time is not a barrier; worldly authority is not a barrier. The only thing that limits His authority is our belief. </br></br>
His Words are made health to all flesh. Remember the Centurion who received a Word and his servant was healed. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
Let us pray: Lord, our soul is waiting for You. In Your Word is our hope. In Your Word is our healing. In Your Word is our blessing. In Your Word is our salvation , in Your holy name. </br></br>
I pray today for miracles; let Your Word bring them – healing, blessing and salvation. I rebuke that sickness, that unpleasant situation. I give You praise in Your holy name. </br></br>
When the Holy Spirit speaks, changes are beginning.</br></br>
Ask God to give you a Word that will change the course of your life forever, in Jesus’ name.</br></br>
If you realise that the level of your faith is not enough to receive from Jesus, remember: you are not called upon to look within yourself to see how much faith you have but you are called upon to look to Jesus and take from Him the faith HE has prepared to give you. </br></br>
“Lord Jesus, add to my faith, in Your holy name! Give me Your kind of faith. Make me to believe in Your own way, in Your mighty name.”</br></br>

<h1>The Prostitute </h1>
<p>
LUKE 7:37-50</br></br>
<kolor>From the moment Jesus entered her life, HE put an end to her life of prostitution. </kolor></br></br>
“And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil, and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil. Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, ‘This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner’.” <kolor>LUKE 7:37-39 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
The Pharisee saw the woman in the past and in the present; he did not consider her future. He saw her as a sinful woman and felt the woman would not have anything to do with Jesus at present. That was his judgement. He judged her past and any other woman in her position, who is without vision, would feel condemned because of her sin. The prostitute was not looking at where she was coming from but where she was going. She was a women of vision. This is to show that when you have a vision, nothing can stop you from reaching your goal. No hardship, trouble, sickness, or even unrighteousness can stop you from reaching your goal. </br></br>
When you are a man of vision, you will not look at where you are coming from but where you are going. For her to run after Jesus as a prostitute, she must have had a vision which said: “If only I can reach Jesus, I will be made whole,” and she was made whole indeed. Your vision has to do with where you are going, not where are you coming from. You are coming from sin and going to Jesus. Faith is moving towards the direction of Jesus. Faith is the cause of victory; it is the means, the instrument and the spiritual armour by which we overcome sin and the world. </br></br>
The Bible says, <kolor>when Jesus enters our lives, HE ends our past and gives birth to our future</kolor>. This woman had a vision and that was why she was running after Jesus. What was her vision? Her vision said: “If only I can reach Jesus, I know I will be clean, I will be healed of my sin.” When you are healed of sin, you are healed indeed.</br></br>
Whatever situation you are in, the way you handle it matters. Remember, the whole world is watching you; among them your friends and foes. </br></br>
Prostitutes, we know, run after their “customers” – those who patronise them, but here was a prostitute running after a holy man. Certainly, she must have had a vision known to her alone. What is your situation? Whatever your situation, the way you handle it matters. That she was a prostitute does not mean she did not have a vision. The prostitute was bold enough to run after Jesus because she had a vision that if only she could reach Jesus, it would be well and the Bible says it was well with her indeed. The Bible says when you have a vision, it will give you courage, confidence and boldness to go on – no matters what anyone says, no matter what happens and no matter your circumstance. <kolor>A vision imparts into you the strength to endure your present tribulation.</kolor> </br></br>
Remember, Jesus saw the woman’s faith as someone who wanted to come to Him. How do we show our faith? We show our faith when we start looking at where we are going instead of where we are coming from. Remember, you are coming from sin – unfaithfulness, hatred, lying, impatience, etc. This woman was coming from sin. Jesus said: “Therefore I say to you, your many sins are forgiven, because you loved so much.”</br></br>
Many run after Jesus without vision. Such people can be stopped by circumstances: sickness, poverty, fear, doubt, etc. Circumstances can make them change their confession easily. They move around churches and men of God, not around Jesus, because they have no vision. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
From the moment Jesus entered her life, HE put an end to her life of prostitution. HE said to her: “Your many sins are forgiven”. She believed if she could meet or touch Jesus, she would be made whole.</br></br>
When you look at the case of the prostitute, you will realise that Jesus did not look at where she was coming from. From the moment Jesus entered her life, HE put an end to her life of prostitution. We know that the life of a prostitute is that of lust, impurity and anger – all of the fruits of the flesh.</br></br>
Ask Jesus to come into your life and put an end to your bad habits! It was bad habits that made her a prostitute. </br></br>
Say, “Lord Jesus, put an end to my bad habits – lust, envy, jealousy, impurity, immorality and anger, in Your holy name”. </br></br>
This means Jesus enters our life to put an end to where we are coming from and give birth to where we are going. </br></br>
“Therefore I say to you, her sins which are many, are forgiven.” <kolor>LUKE 7:47</kolor></br></br>
Your “sins that are many”, are what the Bible refers to here. </br></br>
Right now, Lord Jesus, we ask You to speak forgiveness into our lives. Speak forgiveness into our lives, in Your mighty name. </br></br>
Jesus never disconnected Himself from those who made mistakes with their lives. What are your mistakes? They are correctable. What have you done wrong? Remember the prostitute. Jesus said to her, “Therefore I say to you, your many sins are forgiven”.</br></br>
Therefore, I say unto you, your many sins are forgiven, in Jesus’ name.</br></br>

<h1>The Woman With The Issue Of Blood</h1>
<p>
MARK 5:25-34</br></br>
<kolor>What you receive from God comes as a result of you actively reaching out and claiming God’s promises.</kolor> </br></br>
“Now a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years, and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse. When she heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment. For she said, ‘If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well’. “ <kolor>MARK 5:25-28 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
The women with the issue of blood touched the hem of Jesus’ garment. She was not the only person to touch the hem of His garment. Hers was a touch born of faith. She touched the hem of His garment to attract the attention of Jesus, not the attention of men. She was not there to tempt Jesus. </br></br>
Certainly, she had a vision known to her alone, for she said: “If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well”, and she was well indeed. </br></br>
What is your vision? My vision says: “If I can reach Jesus, I shall be well. If I can obey His Word, I shall be well”. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
Jesus is a close to you as HE was to the woman with the issue of blood. The woman with the issue of blood wanted to come to Jesus and, also, showed her faith. Right now, show your faith; show your belief. If your faith is not enough, you should ask Him for more. 
If your faith is not enough, right now, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, receive!</br></br>
You are not asked to look within and see how much faith you have. You are asked to look to Jesus. Look to Jesus by His Word. </br></br>
Your capacity to believe in Jesus as the Healer, as the Saviour – begin to increase in His holy name!</br></br>
Lord Jesus, increase their capacity to believe! In Your powerful name.</br></br>

<h1>The Canaanite woman</h1>
<p>
MATTHEW 15:22-28</br></br>
<kolor>If the Canaanite woman had run after Jesus without faith, she would have been stopped.</kolor></br></br>
“And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, ‘Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.’ But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, ‘Send her away, for she cries after us.’ But He answered and said, ‘I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.’ Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, ‘Lord, help me!’ But He answered and said, ‘It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs’. “ <kolor>MATTHEW 15:22-26 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
Jesus said, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel” and the woman was not an Israelite. Jesus ignored her. The term “dogs”, as used in the Holy Bible, portrays someone without honour and respect. If the woman had no faith, the contempt she received would have been enough to discourage her. At first she was ignored and then she was humiliated by the disciples; she would have given up and surrendered. Indeed, she was running after Jesus by faith. How many of you can stand such a situation?</br></br>
If the woman had run after Jesus without faith, she would have been stopped. She was a diligent seeker. A diligent seeker is one who believes in God in both good and hard times alike; one who is steadfast in his faith and one who sees his good times as a reason for believing in Jesus, just as he sees his hard times in the same way. </br></br>
What lesson can we learn from this woman? <kolor>Patience, perseverance, endurance, forbearance are the tools, the instruments, for a man of faith.</kolor> A man without faith is a man without perseverance, forbearance, endurance and patience. </br></br>
The Canaanite woman showed that she believed in the Person of Jesus. She never had any doubt at all; that was why she was crying. People of God, learn from this woman, the rewards of patience, perseverance and forbearance. Her patience, perseverance and forbearance surely produced many fruits. </br></br>
<kolor>Give God time and you will see the results working themselves out – slowly but surely.</kolor> Your prayers and fasting are not lost. They will come back to you a hundredfold at God’s own time. </br></br>
The way this woman of Canaan was ignored at first was capable of discouraging her.</br></br>
One should remember that man has the power of decision but the Holy Spirit decides as HE wills. While the woman of Canaan was talking to Jesus, there was conflict in her mind as to whether to continue or not. Thus, man has the ability to think of many things but the Holy Spirit has the power to decide as HE wills. </br></br>
Put yourself in her position. How would you feel at that moment, with Jesus ignoring you and the disciples urging Him to drive you away? How would you feel? For a human being, this is a moment of conflict. A man without vision would have many things going through his mind: he would begin to see Jesus in a bad light, or, he would give up. As the Canaanite woman had faith and vision, she endured and continued to strive until she was answered. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
The woman was ignored at first by Jesus, but she kept pressing because she had a vision. She kept pressing because she had the vision that if only she could reach Jesus, it would be well with her. </br></br>
Don’t give up! Keep pressing on in His own way, in His own name and His own time. The Lord will send the harvest! Don’t give up. Give God time! The results are working themselves out – slowly but surely! In the face of poverty or sickness, don’t give up! HE will not leave you without blessing or healing. </br></br>
God’s kind of patience has no limits. Ask Him to give it to you, in Jesus’ name. </br></br>
If your patience has a limit, then it is man’s patience. Suppose the woman’s patience had limits; she would have given up along the line. </br></br>
Right now, ask Jesus to give you patience,</br>
enough patience, in His name.</br></br>
Ask Jesus to give you love,</br>
enough love, in His name.</br></br>
Ask Jesus to give you perseverance,</br>
 enough perseverance, in His name.</br></br>
Ask Jesus to give you forbearance,</br>
 enough forbearance, in His name.</br></br>
Ask Jesus to give you endurance,</br>
enough endurance, in His name. </br></br>

<h1>The Father Of the Demon Possessed Boy</h1>
<p>
MARK 9:17-29</br></br>
<kolor>You are not called upon to look within to see how much faith you have but to look to God and take from Him the faith you need.</kolor> </br></br>
“Then one of the crowd answered and said, ‘Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit. And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they could not.’ He answered him and said, ‘O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me’. “ <kolor>MARK 9:17-19 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
Among the crowd the father of the demon-possessed boy was the only person that put to shame the faithless generation. He put the faithless generation to shame by stepping out and claiming God’s promises. Who are the faithless generation? The crowd. Among them were the teachers of the law and the Pharisees. The Bible says that father of the demon-possessed boy stepped out and took Jesus at His Word. He stepped out by his belief in Christ Jesus. He stepped out by his prayer for help, saying: “…I believe; help my unbelief!” <kolor>MARK 9:24 NKJV</kolor> This statement is both a prayer for help and a declaration of his belief in Jesus. </br></br>
Right now, I know many of us have been held back by our associations with friends, religion, culture or traditional beliefs. Right now we want to step out. The father of the demon-possessed boy stepped out. From the crowd, he stepped out, saying: <kolor>“I believe like my people, help me to believe in Your own way.”</kolor> </br></br>
He stepped out of the crowd. Among this crowd were Pharisees and teachers of the law who had traditional beliefs. As you stand before your difficulty, you have to acknowledge your need. The difficulty of this man was the sick boy. The man had no faith in the ones Jesus had sent to act on His behalf; that was why Jesus lamented, saying: “ ‘O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me.’ “ <kolor>MARK 9:19 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
This man had no faith but he ran to Jesus. This shows a genuine desire on the part of the seeker. This teaches us that you should look to Jesus and take the faith you need from Him. </br></br>
“ ‘…But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.’ “ <kolor>MARK 9:22 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
This kind of language shows hopelessness. It means, he had nothing. When you are a genuine seeker, <kolor>you are not called upon to look within to see how much faith you have but to look to God and take from Him the faith you need.</kolor> Look to His Word.</br></br>
When it comes to healing, Jesus never heals alone. HE demands people’s faith. HE seeks for a genuine desire on the part of the seeker because healing is for salvation and for the glory of God. </br></br>
One thing is clear, the seeker must show a genuine desire – a genuine willingness on his or her part. A genuine desire on the part of the seeker, plus God’s ability in the life of His servant, brings healing and miracles. </br></br>
Step out from faithless associations! Remember, many things have been holding you back. Right now, it is time to step out from the associations of friends and your culture. Step out, in Jesus Christ’s name! Remember, the father of the demon-possessed boy met Jesus. Before his encounter with Jesus, he never saw anything wrong in his belief. Nevertheless, immediately he met Jesus, he realised his weakness. Have you realised your weakness? Begin to confess your weakness, limitation or shortcoming! </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
Today, I say unto you that you are going to put the faithless generation to shame, in Jesus’ name. I mean, today you shall put satan and all his vices around you to shame, in Jesus’ name. </br></br>
Remember, some people are watching you; among them are your friends and foes – those who are waiting to ask you, “Where is your God?” You shall put all of them of shame today, in Jesus’ name. </br></br>
Before the father of the demon-possessed boy met Jesus, he did not see anything wrong with the standard of his belief. Remember, his standard of belief was the same as those of other members of the crowd. That was why they had the same mind towards the disciples of Jesus. However, when he met Jesus, he understood the weakness of his belief and then stepped out with boldness, thereby renouncing his association with the faithless generation. Stepping out, he cried to Jesus: “I know I believe like my people – now I know I need to believe in Your own way.” </br></br>
I know many of us today have been held back by our own associations with friends, relations, cultures and traditional beliefs. Now I say unto you: like the father of the demon-possessed boy, you shall step out with boldness today and take God at His Word, in Jesus’ name. </br></br>
Right now begin to step out and take God at His Word, in Jesus’ name. </br></br>
Remember, the father of the demon-possessed boy put the faithless generation to shame with his belief and prayer saying, “ ‘…I believe; help my unbelief’. “ <kolor>MARK 9:24 NKJV</kolor> This statement is both an expression of belief in our Lord Jesus Christ and a prayer for help.</br></br> 
Lord Jesus, I know I believe like my people but help me to believe in Your own way, in Your holy name.</br></br>

<h1>Blind Bartimaeus</h1>
<p>
MARK 10:46-52</br></br>
<kolor>As a Christian, when you have a vision, no amount of obstruction can change your mind. </kolor></br></br>
“…As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the son of Timaeus), was sitting by the road begging. When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, ‘Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!’ Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, ‘Son of David, have mercy on me!’ Jesus stopped and said, ‘Call him.’ So they called to the blind man, ‘Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you’. “ <kolor>MARK 10:46-49</kolor></br></br>
Blind Bartimaeus shouted to be heard by Jesus, not by man. This was a shout born of faith which could not be stopped by any opposition. That was why every attempt to stop him proved abortive. What an effort born of faith! What a genuine willingness born of faith! He was there to see Jesus: he was not there to be seen by men. Blind Bartimaeus shouted as someone who wanted to see Jesus. I know many people will say: “I cry many times to receive Jesus’ healing, but I don’t get healed.” </br></br>
A shout born of God, Jesus never ignores. A shout born of God cannot but yield the desired results. A shout born of God cannot be stopped, no matter the degree of opposition. Bartimaeus’ shout was born of faith: it was not just a shout. </br></br>
“Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, ‘Son of David, have mercy on me!’ “ <kolor>MARK 10:48</kolor></br></br>
You can see how every attempt to stop the blind man proved abortive – it was because the shout was born of faith. This is different from other shouts for selfish and material reasons, which can be stopped.</br></br>
Bartimaeus had enough antagonism, enough opposition and enough obstruction to stop him. If you have a vision, nothing can stop you from reaching Jesus; nothing can prevent you from reaching your goal. Faith will fill your soul with a strong desire for the things you are praying for, even when the circumstances seems unfavourable. </br></br>
For an example, where there is faith, there will be a strong desire to pray the more, even in the face of difficulties. Consider the case of Paul and Silas; the more they were flogged, the stronger their desire was to praise God. </br></br>

<h1>Zacchaeus</h1>
<p>
LUKE 19:1-10</br></br>
<kolor>Without an attitude of repentance and faith, God’s power cannot work in a man’s heart.</kolor></br></br>
“Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. He wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of the crowd. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, ‘Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today’. “ <kolor>LUKE 19:1-5</kolor></br></br>
Zacchaeus was born a short man. There was nothing he could do about it. We call it a natural circumstance of birth. However, the fact that he was a short man could not stop him because he had a vision: he wanted an encounter with Jesus. </br></br>
“A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.” <kolor>LUKE 19:2</kolor></br></br>
This man wanted to encounter with Jesus. He was rich and lacked nothing. Though he was rich and lacked nothing in material terms, he was in need of redemption. Is was funny to see a rich man climb a tree the way he did. Have you ever seen a rich man climb a tree? Ordinarily, no one would have expected a man like him to climb a tree. The Bible says that Zacchaeus was rich but he needed to see Jesus. He just needed an encounter with Jesus at all costs. So, if his height was going to disturb him, he was ready to disgrace satan. In desperation he had to climb the tree. </br></br>
The Bible explains that there is a mixture of God’s grace and power with man’s will and faith. I mean, the Word of God is to cause faith and the grace of God is to cover sins. Zacchaeus exercised his will through his mind. That is, he had the power and the discretion to say, “No, I don’t want to climb this tree!” He had the power to decide to climb or not to climb. He was a free moral agent. Remember, there are three spirits: God’s Spirit, satan’s spirit and your own spirit. </br></br>
<kolor>Without an attitude of repentance and faith, God’s power cannot work in a man’s heart.</kolor> What does this mean? This means that man’s will must be obedient to God’s will before he can receive anything from Him. </br></br>
Zacchaeus’ will was obedient to Jesus’ will before he received his redemption. He showed an attitude of repentance and faith in Jesus. That was why Jesus’ power worked in his heart and he received redemption. That was why he was able to make up his mind. He did not say, “I’m too short to see Jesus”, nor did he consider himself a man too rich to climb a tree. He did not bother himself with any of these considerations. </br></br>
Zacchaeus yielded to God by climbing the tree in order to gain Jesus’ attention. That was his vision at that moment. His vision was, “If I can raise myself above everyone, I will gain the attention of Jesus.” That was his desire as he saw Jesus coming. “I want to see this man”, he must have said in his heart. “…but being a short man he could not…” <kolor>LUKE 19:3</kolor> As a man of vision, being a short man could not stop him from reaching his goal. </br></br>
Today, there are many factors that influence your will. The factor that could have influenced Zacchaeus’ will was his natural circumstance of birth – he was short from birth. For an example, you want to be a soldier but when you go for a medical test, you fail to measure up because you are not physically fit. You want to be a pilot but you cannot see far. In your own life, it could be a natural circumstance of birth such as sickness, disease, poverty, fear or doubt. Zacchaeus was born a short man but that could not change his destiny. </br></br>
There is nothing to discourage you from reaching God. If Zacchaeus could not be discouraged, there is no reason why you should be discouraged. So, move on. Why should anyone be accused of murder and yet move on? Moses was a murderer but that could not stop his vision. Remember King David. When the prophet came and said to him, “You are not only a murderer but a fornicator,” David said, “Oh Lord, what shall I do?” (see <kolor>2 SAMUEL 12:7-13</kolor>) The Bible says he removed his coat of kingship and begged for forgiveness (see <kolor>PSALM 51</kolor>). His difficulty improved him. Our difficulties are to improve us. David came out stronger. </br></br>
Everyone is born with various stigmas. You have your own stigma but that should not stop you from moving on. </br></br>
Today, many people blame their situation on their family backgrounds. Some will say, “I am poor because everyone in my family is poor.” </br></br>
If you make an excuse for being poor, your poverty cannot be excused. </br></br>
You are responsible for what you give your attention to. So, it unnecessary to blame your situation on anyone. In the same way, you are responsible for your own actions. Today it is common for people to blame their failure on their family backgrounds but to attribute their success to their personal effort. If you attribute your success to your personal effort, you should also accept the blame for your failure. </br></br>
When we make excuses for our wrongdoing, our wrongdoing will not be excused. For an example, I found myself in a family background that irritated me in those early years of my life. I knew I would be blamed for what I gave my attention to. So, I took a different direction in order to achieve a different solution by recognising that victory obtained through Christ Jesus is a time past victory. I mean, it is victory assured. Rather than despair and blame my situation on my family background, I begun to be proud of my situation in order to feel Christ’s victory over me. </br></br>
I became content with my situation, knowing that it was redeemable through Christ Jesus and that redemption is a time past redemption – I mean a redemption assured. </br></br>
I began to take God at His Word in order to have His way. Remember, no one is too good or too bad to qualify for His grace. It was possible for me to sit somewhere and begin to make excuses for my situation, as a free moral agent. </br></br>
Zacchaeus had the power to choose whom he would serve: to serve satan and remain in that deplorable state or to serve God and receive redemption. In other words, man can decide to yield himself to either God or the devil. Whoever you yield yourself to obey, that is whose servant you are (see <kolor>ROMANS 6:16</kolor>). </br></br>
Whatever I am today is a product of the conviction that victory through Christ is victory indeed. The rest is history. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
O Holy Spirit who reconciles all things in Christ, reconcile me now!</br></br>
Ask Jesus to take you from where you are now to where HE wants you to be.</br></br>

<h1>The Man At The Beautiful Gate</h1>
<p>
ACTS 3:1-8</br></br>
<kolor>A look of faith is not just a look, but a look born of God.</kolor></br></br>
“One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer – at three in the afternoon. Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, ‘Look at us!’ So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.” <kolor>ACTS 3:1-5</kolor></br></br>
He saw Peter and John about to enter and asked them for money. Peter looked straight at him and said, “Look at us”, and the man gave Peter his attention, expecting to get something from them. Peter, as a man of faith, said to the crippled man, “Look at us!” This was not just a look which anybody could look. The look Peter was referring to was not just a look but a look of faith. A look born of faith is a look born of God.</br></br>
The need of the crippled man on the outside was silver and gold. Assuming the crippled man had looked on the outside of Peter he would have just seen a fisherman, and what could a fisherman offer? A fisherman has nothing to offer. Assuming he was not looking at Peter on the inside, this kind of look would not have been a look born of faith. Remember, anyone can pray, but only prayers of faith attract Jesus’ attention. Many people cry, “Man of God, help me!” Anyone can cry, but only a cry born of faith can attract the man of God. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
The man at the Beautiful Gate was crippled when Peter and John met him. </br></br>
“Then Peter said, ‘Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!’ “ <kolor>ACTS 3:6</kolor></br></br>
After his miracle, he began to walk.</br></br>
Say, “Every department of my life that is crippled, every department of my life that has stopped – walk!” There are many things in your life that are crippled. Be it in your business – walk! Be it in your finances, marriage, family, health – walk!</br></br>
Everything about the man at the Beautiful Gate had stopped before Peter met him. Anything in every department of your life that has stopped – move in Jesus’ name! Walk in Jesus’ name!</br></br>

<h1>Stephen</h1>
<p>
ACTS 7:54-60</br></br>
<kolor>Stephen was conscious of his faith even in the face of threats to life. </kolor></br></br>
“When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. ‘Look,’ he said, ‘I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.’ At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witness laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, ‘Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.’ Then he fell on his knees and cried out, ‘Lord, do not hold this sin against them.’ When he had said this, he fell asleep.” <kolor>ACTS 7:54-60</kolor></br></br>
The Bible says the fear of being stoned did not scare Stephen to abandon his faith and his cause. He was conscious of his faith even in death. The more he was stoned, the stronger he became in his belief, faith and conviction and the more he confessed, “Jesus is the Lord. Jesus is the Redeemer. Jesus is the Saviour”. He saw his pain as a reason for believing God, just as he would his good times. What he needed to go free was to recant his belief. Yet at each stone cast on Stephen, the Bible says he confessed, “Jesus is Lord!”</br></br>
However in your case today, when your trouble is so much, instead of praying the more, you get discouraged and bow to the pressure of the problem. The more your problems: the more you are discouraged, the more you blaspheme, the more you condemn, the more you say, “Jesus be cursed”. The more your trials, persecution, isolation and loneliness: the more you grumbling, the more your self-pity, the more your complaint, the more you begin to see Jesus in a bad light. </br></br>
You are never conscious of your faith when there is pressure, tension or sickness. Remember, as a Christian, problems are meant for your belief. Yet instead of praying the more and having faith the more, you get discouraged. </br></br>
You allow yourself to be defeated under the weight of the problem. Stephen was able to withstand the stoning because his focus was on his dream of salvation, not on the happiness on the outside. When your focus is on your dream, whatever happens around you will not matter to you (see <kolor>ACTS 7:55-58</kolor>).</br></br>
“His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.” <kolor>ACTS 5:40-42</kolor></br></br>
In the face of threats to life, one could continue doing one’s assignment for God’s sake if one is led by the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit is involved, you will suffer in His way and time. When the apostles were beaten, instead of them to despair, they were happy. They were encouraged because they saw it as a rare privilege to suffer for Christ. They did not preach themselves but Christ; what they heard, they preached. This was the preaching that offended the priests, Pharisees and Saducees. </br></br>
PRAYER POINTS</br></br>
Ask God to give you the grace to be conscious of your faith even in the face of threats to life, in Jesus’ name. </br></br>
Say, “Lord Jesus, give me a vision that will impart into me the strength to endure my present situation, in Your holy name.”</br></br>

<h1>The Ethiopian Eunuch</h1>
<p>
ACTS 8:26-39</br></br>
<kolor>Even though the Ethiopian Eunuch knew that what he wanted to know was not possible without a guide, he was not discouraged.</kolor></br></br>
“Then the Spirit said to Philip, ‘Go near and overtake this chariot.’ So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, ‘Do you understand what you are reading?’ And he said, ‘How can I, unless someone guides me?’ And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him.” <kolor>ACTS 8:29-31 NKJV</kolor></br></br>
While the Ethiopian Eunuch was busy thinking of his inability to understand the book of Isaiah, little did he know that Somebody was busy planning his enlightenment. That person is the Holy Spirit (see <kolor>ACTS 8:26</kolor>).</br></br>
One thing is clear: man must first show a genuine desire. The Ethiopian Eunuch showed a genuine willingness. The Lord knew his weakness and also his genuine desire: he was desirous to know God better through the written Word of God. He knew that what he wanted to know was difficult to achieve without a guide and that it could only be received by faith. </br></br>
This situation had to do with his willingness and God’s ability. The Ethiopian Eunuch was willing to know more about God. He had a genuine desire. “How can I understand unless someone guides me?” he asked. Even though he knew that what he wanted to know was not possible without a guide, he was not discouraged. He continued reading until the guide came. He had a genuine desire to know more about God, to know what many did not know. Many in his position, without a vision, would have just given up. The Bible says many are called, few are chosen (see <kolor>MATTHEW 22:14</kolor>). People without a vision would give up, but the Ethiopian Eunuch continued to strive after the truth. “To strive” means to struggle. Even though he knew that what he wanted to know was difficult to come by without a guide, he continued to strive. He continued reading until Philip came to help. This is a good example of a genuine desire. Assuming the Ethiopian Eunuch had given up on the situation, what would have happened?</br></br>
God would have seen him as an unserious mind. The whole world, including Philip, would have seen him the same way. You have to play your own role and God will send someone to help. The Ethiopian Eunuch never gave up to his situation, as many give up to their situations today. Your situation could be trials, temptations or crises.</br></br>
He kept on reading what he could not read without a guide. He knew he needed a guide who was coming to enlighten him. You can only do what you don’t know how to do when you know God will send someone along to guide you. </br></br>

<h1>Paul & Silas</h1>
<p>
ACTS 16:20-25</br></br>
<kolor>Paul and Silas chose the bright colour of praise instead of the dark colours of depression, bitterness, despair, self-pity and rejection.</kolor></br></br>
“Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks. About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody’s chains came loose.” <kolor>ACTS 16:24-26</kolor></br></br>
In the case of Paul and Silas, bodily pains counted for nothing. Instead of the beating and humiliation they received in the hands of the Romans officials and the mob, making them abandon their cause (I mean their faith), it made them have faith the more, pray the more, believe the more and praise the God more. The more they were beaten, humiliated and embarrassed, the more their faith, belief and conviction about Jesus Christ. </br></br>
When Paul and Sylas were chained to the ground, they began to sign praises to the Lord. They saw their suffering as a reason for their belief, just as they saw their freedom. </br></br>
They were conscious of their faith even under the serious pressure and threat to their lives. They were expected to say, “We are very sorry; we will not mention the name, Jesus, again.”</br></br>
Ordinarily, their situation did not call for thanksgiving or praise. They were praising God while being chained hands and feet. When you are face to face with Jesus, HE is not interested in your appearance, position, whether you are a king, queen, president or secretary general. HE is only interested in your faith because that is what makes you one with Him.</br></br>
When Paul and Silas were imprisoned at Philippi and their backs were raw from beatings, they sang hymns (see <kolor>ACTS 16:23-25</kolor>). They chose the bright colour of praise instead of the dark colours of depression, bitterness, despair, self-pity and rejection. No matter what affliction or crisis we may face, we too can decide how to respond. </br></br>
<kolor>Apostle Paul was conscious of his faith even under pressure and tension. Daniel was conscious of his faith even under pressure and tension. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were conscious of their faith even under pressure and tension. </kolor>What they needed to go free was to say, “I am sorry, Oh King, We will worship your god and your god will be our god”. On the contrary, they were conscious of their faith so they stayed true to their God, even under serious pressure and the threat to their lives.</br></br>
PRAYER POINTS </br></br>
Ask God to give you the grace to be conscious of your faith even under pressure and tension, in Jesus’ name. </br></br>
When Paul and Silas were in prison, the angel of God visited them and the foundations of the prison were shaken. The angel of God wants to visit you right now. He is on his way. </br></br>
The foundation and pillar of your problem, crumble, in Jesus’ name!</br></br>
Right now, it is time to take all the breakthrough keys. The book of <kolor>MATTHEW 16:19</kolor> says, “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosen in heaven.” The Lord promised to give you keys to loose whatever has been bound in your life – breakthrough keys to your finances and your marital bliss. </br></br>
Continue to take all the breakthrough keys – keys to loose and keys to bind. Whatever might have been bound, be loosed in Jesus’ name; whatever might have been loosed, be bound in Jesus’ name!</br></br>

<h1>CONGRATULATIONS!</h1>
<p>
You have finished your reading of this book, <kolor>The Mirror</kolor>. Kindly accept my congratulations. Remember, however, that as Christians, our road map is the Bible. The more we read it with devotion, the more effective we will be for God. We must approach God’s Word as if our lives depended on it. The Word of God will build your faith. Faith will grow as you continually hear God’s Word. </br></br>
The Bible says whoever desires can be saved (see <kolor>REVELATIONS 22:17</kolor>). Obviously, any person who hears God’s Word and acts on it can exercise faith. People who neither hear God’s Word nor obey it do not have God’s kind of faith. Faith requires hearing and obeying so that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked man, for not all have faith (see <kolor>2 THESSALONIANS 3:2</kolor>). You therefore have to do the following:</br></br>
<kolor>ONE//</kolor> read your Bible daily,</br>
<kolor>TWO//</kolor> read it because it is food for your soul,</br>
<kolor>THREE//</kolor> read it because it is guide for your feet,</br>
<kolor>FOUR//</kolor> read it because it is very profitable,</br>
<kolor>FIVE//</kolor> read it to keep you from error and sin,</br>
<kolor>SIX//</kolor> read it because it has healing power and,</br>
<kolor>SEVEN//</kolor> read it because it has a purifying power.</br></br>
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO</br></br>
Pray for your church that your pastors, deacons, evangelists and all the members may be filled with the Holy Spirit and be used by Him. </br></br>
Discuss with your pastor, teacher or friend about what you have gained from <kolor>The Mirror</kolor>. </br></br>
THE POWER OF FAITH</br></br>
What is the power of faith? Read the following for an answer: </br></br>
<kolor>ONE//</kolor> MARK 9:23</br>
<kolor>TWO//</kolor> HEBREWS 11:6</br>
<kolor>THREE//</kolor> GALATIANS 3:14</br>
<kolor>FOUR//</kolor> JAMES 5:15</br>
<kolor>FIVE//</kolor> EPHESIANS 2:8</br></br>
One of the best chapters in the entire Bible on the subject of faith is the 11th chapter of Hebrews. I suggest the chapter to be read as you read the words in this book on the subject of faith. </br></br>
Finally, I would like to congratulate you again on the success you have achieved so far in completing your reading of this book, <kolor>The Mirror</kolor>. God bless you. Amen.</br></br>

You shall march around the city, all you men of war; you shall go all around the city once. This you shall do six days. And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark. But the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. It shall come to pass, when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, that all the people shall shout with a great shout; then the wall of the city will fall down flat. And the people shall go up every man straight before him.” Then Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord.” And he said to the people, “Proceed, and march around the city, and let him who is armed advance before the ark of the Lord.” So it was, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the Lord advanced and blew the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them. The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets. Now Joshua had commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout or make any noise with your voice, nor shall a word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout.” So he had the ark of the Lord circle the city, going around it once. Then they came into the camp and lodged in the camp. And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord. Then seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the Lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets. And the armed men went before them. But the rear guard came after the ark of the Lord, while the priests continued blowing the trumpets. And the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. So they did six days. But it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early, about the dawning of the day, and marched around the city seven times in the same manner. On that day only they marched around the city seven times. And the seventh time it happened, when the priests blew the trumpets, that Joshua said to the people: “Shout, for the Lord has given you the city! Now the city shall be doomed by the Lord to destruction, it and all who are in it. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. And you, by all means abstain from the accursed things, lest you become accursed when you take of the accursed things, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. But all the silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are consecrated to the Lord; they shall come into the treasury of the Lord.” So the people shouted when the priests blew the trumpets. And it happened when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat. Then the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.

Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, “The Lord has not chosen these.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all the young men here?” Then he said, “There remains yet the youngest, and there he is, keeping the sheep.” And Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him. For we will not sit down[b] till he comes here.” So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with bright eyes, and good-looking. And the Lord said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!” Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel arose and went to Ramah.

And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were dreadfully afraid. So the men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? Surely he has come up to defy Israel; and it shall be that the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches, will give him his daughter, and give his father’s house exemption from taxes in Israel.” Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”</br></br>
So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David.

Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. Then all this assembly shall know that the Lord does not save with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord’s, and He will give you into our hands.” So it was, when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. Then David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone; and he slung it and struck the Philistine in his forehead, so that the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David.

Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.” So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; then he bowed down on the ground, and put his face between his knees, and said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” So he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.” And seven times he said, “Go again.” Then it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, “There is a cloud, as small as a man’s hand, rising out of the sea!” So he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.’” Now it happened in the meantime that the sky became black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain. So Ahab rode away and went to Jezreel. Then the hand of the Lord came upon Elijah; and he girded up his loins and ran ahead of Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan[b] also came among them. And the Lord said to Satan, “From where do you come?” So Satan answered the Lord and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.” Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?” So Satan answered the Lord and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!” And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on his person.”</BR></BR>
So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.</BR>

Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house; and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, when the Sabeans raided them and took them away—indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!” While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!” While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!” While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 19 and suddenly a great wind came from across[d] the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!” Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. And he said:

And makes flesh his strength,</br>
Whose heart departs from the Lord.</br>
For he shall be like a shrub in the desert,</br>
And shall not see when good comes,</br>
But shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,</br>
In a salt land which is not inhabited.</br>
“Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord,</br>
And whose hope is the Lord.</br>
For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters,</br>
Which spreads out its roots by the river,</br>
And will not fear when heat comes;</br>
But its leaf will be green,</br>
And will not be anxious in the year of drought,</br>
Nor will cease from yielding fruit.</br>

Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature? “So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? “Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.  But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, “Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel! And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.” And his servant was healed that same hour.

For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments. They love the best places at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues, greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, ‘Rabbi, Rabbi.’ But you, do not be called ‘Rabbi’; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brethren. Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ. But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation. “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves. “Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obliged to perform it.’ Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold? And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obliged to perform it.’ Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift? Therefore he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all things on it. He who swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it. And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it. “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone. Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel! “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also. “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, and say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.’ “Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.

And Jesus said, “Who touched Me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say, ‘Who touched Me?’” But Jesus said, “Somebody touched Me, for I perceived power going out from Me.” Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately. And He said to her, “Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”

Suddenly a man from the multitude cried out, saying, “Teacher, I implore You, look on my son, for he is my only child. And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth; and it departs from him with great difficulty, bruising him. So I implored Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.” Then Jesus answered and said, “O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.” And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.

Then He spoke a parable to them, that men always ought to pray and not lose heart, saying: “There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man. Now there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, ‘Get justice for me from my adversary.’ And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself, ‘Though I do not fear God nor regard man, yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.’” Then the Lord said, “Hear what the unjust judge said. And shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them? I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?”

And when he had come near, He asked him, saying, “What do you want Me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, that I may receive my sight.” Then Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.” And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God.

There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.” Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?” Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” Nicodemus answered and said to Him, “How can these things be?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things? Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and you do not receive Our witness. If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.”

Do you believe this?” She said to Him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.” And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, “The Teacher has come and is calling for you.” As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him. Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was[b] in the place where Martha met Him. Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb to weep there.” Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.” Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled. And He said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to Him, “Lord, come and see.” Jesus wept. Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!” And some of them said, “Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have kept this man from dying?” Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, “Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.” Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?” Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me.” Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth!” And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth.

But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.

Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church. And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison. Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, “Arise quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands. Then the angel said to him, “Gird yourself and tie on your sandals”; and so he did. And he said to him, “Put on your garment and follow me.” So he went out and followed him, and did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. When they were past the first and the second guard posts, they came to the iron gate that leads to the city, which opened to them of its own accord; and they went out and went down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.

My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment. For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body. Indeed, we put bits in horses’ mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body. Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires. Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things.
See how great a forest a little fire kindles! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell. For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so. Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening? Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh.</br>
Heavenly Versus Demonic Wisdom</br>
Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom. But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic. For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.  Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
