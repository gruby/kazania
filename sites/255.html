  <p>    
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>He is in Kaduna.
    <br>Because there is a threatening letter you people received.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>- There is a threatening letter.
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>- Please come. I will see you.
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The following Sunday, the husband of the woman who received the prophecy from Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>concerning a threatening letter, travelled from Kano, Nigeria
    <br>to confirm the prophetic word at The SCOAN.
    <br>My name is Lucy Ajagba.
    <br>I'm from Benue State, Nigeria, but I came that day from Kaduna State.
    <br>Here is my husband,
    <br>my husband's mother,
    <br>my husband's younger sister,
    <br>here is my father,
    <br>my mother,
    <br>and my younger brother.
    <br>On January 6, 2013, I was here in the church.
    <br>When the man of God came to me, he asked me where my husband was
    <br>and I told him that my husband was in Kaduna.
    <br>So, he told me that there was a threat letter he received.
    <br>I confirmed it to be true because in 2010, after our wedding,
    <br>my husband's ex-girlfriend sent me a threat letter
    <br>that my home belonged to her, I was just wasting my time
    <br>and that after everything, she would come to take her position.
    <br>I took it very lightly. I prayed to God.
    <br>She further told me that I would not have any child in that house.
    <br>So, as time went on, I checked my husband's phone.
    <br>On one faithful day, I saw a text message she sent to my husband
    <br>that he should watch and see that he would not have a child.
    <br>I deleted her number and everything concerning her from my husband's phone.
    <br>On December 24, I sent her a letter through what she sent to my husband.
    <br>I asked her.
    <br>According to her, she had a child for my husband
    <br>and that she wanted to bring the child to the family house.
    <br>I sent her a text message.
    <br>If really the child is for my husband, why couldn't she bring the child?
    <br>She started insulting me.
    <br>She called my husband on December 25, 2012.
    <br>My husband and his family sent me out of the house,
    <br>saying that since I called her, I didn't want him to see the child.
    <br>So, I left the house and came to The SCOAN because I know this is the arena of liberty.
    <br>I know...
    <br>I knew that since nobody was there to listen to me, God would listen to me.
    <br>I ran to this place.
    <br>On that faithful day, it was as if the man of God knew my heart.
    <br>I said that this man must talk to me today or else, I wouldn't know where to go from here.
    <br>He came to me and went straight to the reason why I was here.
    <br>I was surprised.
    <br>From there, they invited my husband and his parents.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Monday Ajagba.
    <br>Last week, I travelled to Benue State because I had admission to the School of Technology.
    <br>On getting there, that very day...
    <br>Before I travelled, I told my mum that I dreamt about the man of God.
    <br>I saw him talking to me; my wife was standing and another lady was standing.
    <br>I travelled and my mum called me and said, "My son, your prophecy has come to pass."
    <br>I said, "What happened?"
    <br>She said that they had called from The SCOAN that I should come and that my wife was there.
    <br>I work in the army and my wife works in the police.
    <br>We went for an operation in Darfur.
    <br>I met her in Darfur and we started having a relationship,
    <br>even though the relationship was not very close.
    <br>We had not known each other much because of the duties we had to do.
    <br>We had an agreement that when we got back to Nigeria, we would get married.
    <br>She had to stay for one year and I had to stay for seven months.
    <br>So, I came back before her.
    <br>She then came on leave.
    <br>I wanted to introduce her to my parents and she said that she had something to tell me.
    <br>I asked her what it was.
    <br>She said that if she told me, I was going to change my mind about everything.
    <br>I said, "No, tell me."
    <br>She said that she had a child for somebody.
    <br>I said, "Oh really?"
    <br>She said, "Yes."
    <br>I said that she shouldn't worry because it wasn't a problem and that I would talk to my parents.
    <br>I told my parents that she was the woman I met when I was in Darfur
    <br>and that I wanted to get married to her.
    <br>They said, "No problem."
    <br>I told them that there was a problem.
    <br>I said that she had a child for somebody.
    <br>They asked how old the child was.
    <br>I said that I didn't really know the age.
    <br>They said there was no problem and that since she made a mistake in her life,
    <br>I should be able to correct it.
    <br>They asked me if I loved her.
    <br>I said "Yes."
    <br>They said, "OK, no problem, you should go ahead."
    <br>So, that was how we arranged everything.
    <br>She went back.
    <br>When she finally came back, we got married in November 2010.
    <br>After the wedding, we started having problems.
    <br>She then told me that she had another child, making two children.
    <br>The two children were from two different fathers.
    <br>They are presently with another man
    <br>who is not the biological father of any of those two children.
    <br>When she told me, we had already married.
    <br>I had to keep it to myself because I loved her.
    <br>There were problems here and there.
    <br>I am in the army and serve the public.
    <br>In my phones are phone numbers of people I work with - men and women.
    <br>When she came to my house, there were problems here and there.
    <br>She turned my house upside down.
    <br>She wanted to know everything in the house because she is very inquisitive.
    <br>People would be calling me, saying that somebody called them and that her name is Lucy, my wife.
    <br>They said she was disturbing them.
    <br>I called those people and apologised to them.
    <br>I then asked her why she was insulting those people who were my friends.
    <br>She said that all these people were my girlfriends.
    <br>Even the lady she talked about, it was on phone they were communicating.
    <br>I didn't know how she got the lady's number.
    <br>That was how the problem continued.
    <br>When I came for a diploma course in Lagos, she came to visit me.
    <br>When she came, she ignited another problem
    <br>and asked people if they had seen me with a woman
    <br>and how many ladies came to my room.
    <br>She said that I was flirting around.
    <br>She asked me which lady left my room before she came.
    <br>I asked her, "Which lady? Did you meet me with any lady?
    <br>If I had a lady, I wouldn't have invited you."
    <br>That was how the problem continued.
    <br>She then had a very close friend.
    <br>I told that guy that I didn't want to see him with my wife but they continued.
    <br>So, I had problem with that.
    <br>They almost dismissed me
    <br>because once you are in a military course, you don't commit offence.
    <br>I had to plead.
    <br>In the office, she denied me totally.
    <br>She said that whatever I was saying was a lie
    <br>and that whatever other people were saying was the truth.
    <br>She denied me totally there.
    <br>So, from there, we had to go.
    <br>I called both parents and told them.
    <br>My in-laws said that we should go to their place.
    <br>I asked her to go.
    <br>She refused. She said she would stay until the course ended.
    <br>I could not concentrate.
    <br>I think the whole thing started on the platform of insincerity.
    <br>The foundation is purely insincere.
    <br>You are building a house and the foundation is not solid.
    <br>You made a mistake with the foundation - what will happen to the house?
    <br>The house will collapse.
    <br>So, I think this is what has happened now.
    <br>While after a relationship, coming together as a family -
    <br>your husband begins to sense an issue of you having a child for one man,
    <br>another child for one man.
    <br>What kind of story is that?
    <br>... after the foundation, coming together as a family.
    <br>It is too frightening for any man.
    <br>You would be afraid whether you married someone else's wife.
    <br>The man is afraid.
    <br>He may not tell you that he is not interested in the marriage,
    <br>but he will remain silent and this silence is dangerous.
    <br>He doesn't want to come out because if it was only one child, you mentioned initially,
    <br>which you came out with late...
    <br>After you people have married, you came out to say, "I have one child for somebody outside."
    <br>Your husband can still reason, "It was a mistake.
    <br>Why did you not mention it before we got married?"
    <br>He can forgive you.
    <br>But later again -  there is another child somewhere.
    <br>Now, the story is that it is not for the same man, but for another man.
    <br>This is when your husband began to be afraid of the whole thing.
    <br>It is only God who can tell the position of things now.
    <br>If you are saying the truth to your husband now,
    <br>he will not believe anything you will say to him,
    <br>unless God says, "Yes. This is the position of things."
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Why keeping this sensitive issue away from your dear one?
    <br>Man of God, I'm very very grateful to you for giving me this opportunity.
    <br>Right from the moment I met him, I told him everything about my life -
    <br>from Sudan - that is where we met.
    <br>OK, you say you told your husband initially - what did he say?
    <br>I told him at that time I had two kids.
    <br>I explained my life to him.
    <br>I called my mother and...
    <br>Please, the question I'm asking you - don't go too far.
    <br>When you told your husband initially that you had kids, what did your husband say?
    <br>He told me there was no problem, that he was going to live with me like that.
    <br>That was what he told me.
    <br>He did not mention it before that?
    <br>He did not tell me anything before that.
    <br>This is why you too would have been very careful.
    <br>Look, imagine I'm a man;
    <br>if a man loves you and you told a man initially that you had a child out there,
    <br>and he still wants to marry you,
    <br>the first thing he would ask - he wants to see the children.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Even in the case where they had no child, no issue -
    <br>"Please, will I see these children? I want to see them because they are part of our relationship."
    <br>Without these children, the relationship cannot be established.
    <br>Why should you allow this to happen?
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>The point is actually coming out.
    <br>Everything is becoming so clear.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Give me your hand.
    <br>Don't worry.
    <br>Brother, why should you marry my sister?
    <br>She said she told you initially that she had two children somewhere
    <br>and you said you could get on with her, without showing interest in those children out there,
    <br>whereas you don't have any child.
    <br>When we got married, even last month she told me that...
    <br>No. The question I'm asking - answer it.
    <br>Just answer the question.
    <br>She is saying that she told you initially that she had two children somewhere
    <br>and you said to her, "OK, don't worry. We will continue the relationship."
    <br>How can you continue the relationship without inviting those children?
    <br>What do you want to say about that?
    <br>I asked her about the children.
    <br>I told her that...
    <br>It means you have agreed that she told you initially.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>The first answer I was expecting from him is...
    <br>Even in the law court, any judge would expect the first answer from him, "She never told me."
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>That is the first answer!
    <br>So brother, let us ask God if this marriage is from God.
    <br>Don't let us begin to ask about the mistake.
    <br>Is this marriage from God?
    <br>Because she has wronged, you have wronged.
    <br>And this is fifty-fifty now.
    <br>Is this marriage from God?
    <br>Let us ask.
    <br>If the marriage is from God, what do we need to do.
    <br>If it is not from God, I will let you know.
    <br>You will go on your way, I will pray for you, God will give you yours.
    <br>You - God will give you yours.
    <br>But the wrong now is fifty-fifty.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Man of God, the threat letter that you were talking about
    <br>from the woman that said that she had a child for me,
    <br>she sent me a text message that she had a child for me and she sent the pictures to me.
    <br>Brother, do you know the problem you have now?
    <br>You are being surrounded by falsehood.
    <br>The one you are talking about is not a true story.
    <br>So, you need to start your life at the beginning.
    <br>I think you need deliverance.
    <br>My sister needs deliverance.
    <br>After the deliverance - what is God's opinion.
    <br>I know God's opinion about this marriage but I will not tell you until you are delivered,
    <br>and you are delivered.
    <br>The lady who sent the text message is here.
    <br>Let her come out.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>OK, this is the sister.
    <br>My brother, is she the sister that sent the text message?
    <br>Yes. I've just seen her now for the first time since 2009.
    <br>How many years now?
    <br>Four years now.
    <br>Four years.
    <br>- So you are seeing her now...
    <br>- ... for the first time.
    <br>Look at her. Maybe she is not the one.
    <br>She is the one.
    <br>She sent a text message to me that she had a baby girl for me.
    <br>- Baby girl?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>The picture is here.
    <br>She sent the picture.
    <br>Can God SEPARATE A Marriage??? MUST-WATCH!!!
    <br>Are you the one that sent it?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>This is a threat.
    <br>This is not the biological child of this man.
    <br>It is true, Man of God.
    <br>Can God SEPARATE A Marriage??? MUST-WATCH!!!
    <br>I will see all of you. We will all come together.
    <br>You will be delivered. I will follow it up. You will have your own settled home.
    <br>Everybody will have a settled home.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>I thank you very much for the proactive action you are taking over my children.
    <br>I had never heard of this problem if not now, that it came to the man of God.
    <br>I thank you for looking at it.
    <br>I believe that the Almighty God that gives you the power will settle the children, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Lucy Ajegba.
    <br>The problem I had with my husband was about the issue of a threat letter
    <br>which the man of God revealed was all lies.
    <br>Before we came, I had a problem with him.
    <br>He and his parents connived to ask me to leave the house.
    <br>That was what brought me to The SCOAN, the arena of liberty.
    <br>My name is Monday Ajegba.
    <br>I was here at The SCOAN last week
    <br>because of the prophecy the man of God gave concerning my marriage.
    <br>After everything, I know I have made mistakes in my marriage.
    <br>We had problems before she came to The SCOAN
    <br>and I sent her away and told her that I was not interested in the marriage.
    <br>I honoured the call of the man of God; that was why I came.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN and I know I have made mistakes in my marriage.
    <br>Now we are here and waiting for God's direction.
    <br>What mistakes have you made in your marriage?
    <br>After my deliverance, I can see clearly.
    <br>It was as if I was blind before; I can see clearly now.
    <br>I realise that where I decided to get married was not the right place.
    <br>I really thought of it and I understand now.
    <br>Where is the other woman that took the picture saying that it was your child?
    <br>Can God SEPARATE A Marriage??? MUST-WATCH!!!
    <br>OK, this is the woman that came out with the picture of a child.
    <br>Brother, since you people want to start life in a clean slate - fine.
    <br>My sister that stands by you,
    <br>going by the whole story, there is nothing we can hold.
    <br>The whole thing was just falsehood; you lied, she lied.
    <br>Many marriages are like that.
    <br>Now you are delivered and the sister was delivered, and madam too was delivered.
    <br>You should not face any challenges concerning the issue of marriage -
    <br>rather, people would queue, that they want you at all costs for marriage.
    <br>So, you should take your time to ask God's direction.
    <br>If God has shown you who is your wife, bring her back to the church, let us pray for you.
    <br>So, we want to examine everything in the light of God's Word.
    <br>The woman you were living with before -
    <br>there are many things that you people put together.
    <br>Will you tell us, madam, the land issue - you are in possession or what is your share in the land?
    <br>I contributed money for everything, including the house we were building.
    <br>A lot of things.
    <br>OK, they have built the house already?
    <br>Yes but it is not yet completed.
    <br>But the land too...
    <br>You have the 99, let's say 90 percent of the money?
    <br>A hundred percent, sir.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>Brother, did you listen to that?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>If my sister says 100 percent, it means, if at all, your share in that place is just 2 percent.
    <br>So, you should also overlook that 2 percent: your effort, strength.
    <br>You have to pay that price and leave the house and land to this woman.
    <br>Yes, Man of God. I am willing to do that. I have other land.
    <br>I am ready to fulfill that.
    <br>Whether you have other land or not, you have to leave the land.
    <br>So, that is it.
    <br>Can God SEPARATE A Marriage??? MUST-WATCH!!!
    <br>Show this sister that, "Look, not out of hatred, but out of love, you are trying to separate."
    <br>So, that is it.
    <br>What are the other things, my sister, apart from the land and house?
    <br>The accommodation where we were staying, I furnished it completely.
    <br>Accommodation in the place you stay now?
    <br>You are the one that furnished the house.
    <br>Yes, even the car he is driving.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Accommodation where my brother is staying - you furnished it,
    <br>the car he is driving, isn't it?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>I gave him part of the money.
    <br>- You gave him part of the money?
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>How much you gave him, about the car?
    <br>Firstly, I gave him 700,000 naira for the first car.
    <br>Then, he changed to his current car for which I gave him 300,000 naira.
    <br>OK, my brother, for how much did you buy the new car?
    <br>I bought the new car for 1.3 million naira.
    <br>So, that 300,000 is the price you are going to pay, you have to leave it for this man.
    <br>You should not expect him to give you 300,000 naira,
    <br>because he still wants to remember that you are not an enemy.
    <br>You too, you have to remember forever, it is not your enemy.
    <br>Something must connect you people, so the history would remain
    <br>that he is not my enemy, you are not my enemy.
    <br>We do not separate you people so that you may remain enemies to one another.
    <br>But we separate you people - you will remain friends forever.
    <br>So, that is it.
    <br>So, you forget about 300,000.
    <br>The first car you were talking about - we are not living in the past, we are living in the present.
    <br>That first car, you gave 700,000 for - we are not going to talk about that.
    <br>We don't take the journey to the past, we are in the present.
    <br>So 300,000 - we are going to talk about that - forget about that.
    <br>The house you furnished - what do you want to say about that?
    <br>All my belongings are there - my bags and clothes.
    <br>OK. That should not be a problem.
    <br>My brother is ready to give you everything that you want to carry.
    <br>So, you have to open the door and let her carry her belongings.
    <br>Since your certificate is still with you, she is not going to carry your certificate,
    <br>and you are not going to carry her certificate.
    <br>Those things are the product of your effort.
    <br>Your effort is still there, her effort is still there.
    <br>Allow her to carry those things; open the door and let her carry those things.
    <br>And I want to assure you; I will wrestle with your future to make sure you have a very bright future.
    <br>Can God SEPARATE A Marriage??? MUST-WATCH!!!
    <br>I will not leave you just now.
    <br>Even if you leave me, I will not leave you.
    <br>If you say, "I don't want to talk to this man of God", I will continue to talk to you by prayer and fire,
    <br>so that you will have a settled home.
    <br>You are a beautiful woman.
    <br>Now you are delivered. You don't know you are beautiful?
    <br>Now you are delivered, you might know that you are a beautiful woman.
    <br>This is a gift from God.
    <br>There is nothing, nothing has happened, you should thank God.
    <br>My brother too - what a handsome man.
    <br>Nothing has happened.
    <br>By the time you leave here, you will give thanks to God.
    <br>One day, when you have your future partner, you sit with your husband,
    <br>you can give a call to him and say, "How are you doing there?
    <br>I hope you are going to church. How is your Pastor T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>"Fine. OK. Thank you."
    <br>He himself will give you a call one day and say, "I'm settled down now. How are you doing?"
    <br>"Fine. Thank you."
    <br>- "How is T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>- "Fine."
    <br>So, this is what I want. Thank you.
    <br>Brother, you said you were blind.
    <br>And my sister too will agree that indeed, you were blind.
    <br>So we agree on that.
    <br>So, you have seen now.
    <br>So you go, pray to God.
    <br>Whatever direction God has given you, let us know your future.
    <br>My sister too, let us know the direction God has given you.
    <br>My sister, my advice to you is that: thank God.
    <br>The picture you showed - it was not of this man.
    <br>So, this man says he will ask God for direction.
    <br>So nothing can catch him, and nothing can catch this woman.
    <br>You too, you have been delivered, nothing can catch you.
