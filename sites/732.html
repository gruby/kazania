    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>faith releases healing anointing.
    <br>Faith releases blessing and deliverance.
    <br>It is time to build yourself for the journey.
    <br>Walking with the Lord - you need faith to walk with the Lord.
    <br>Whatever barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God -
    <br>the barrier could be pain of the past, bitterness, jealousy, envy, hatred or grief.
    <br>Whatever satan uses to connect you to himself -
    <br>he uses our barrier to connect us to himself.
    <br>He uses offence to connect us to himself.
    <br>He uses grief, strife, resentment to connect us to himself.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect us to himself, begin to disconnect it!
    <br>Disconnect yourself right now!
    <br>That offence, be cursed, be removed!
    <br>I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free!
    <br>Say after me,
    <br>"Take more of me, oh Lord; give me more of You - more of Your purity, Your holiness, Your faithfulness,
    <br>Your humility, Your obedience, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
