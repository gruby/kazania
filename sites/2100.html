  <p>    
    <br>You may be seated. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>It is not all about me, but all about Jesus!
    <br>Tell your neighbour: It's all about Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>This will take us to the message today: Grace In The Soul
    <br>Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul.
    <br>Let me inform you about the arena you are in.
    <br>This is the arena of liberty.
    <br>LEAVE IT FOR GOD!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>In the arena of liberty, the key is not to suppress the flesh;
    <br>the key is to walk in the Spirit.
    <br>Walking in the Spirit is so exciting.
    <br>Paul Apostle says, "The key is not to worry about our situation, but the key is to walk in the Spirit".
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Leave it for God; don't worry yourself!
    <br>The work of healing, deliverance, salvation, blessing -
    <br>these are not brought to pass by anything done by us.
    <br>Whatever you will receive from Jesus
    <br>will not be brought to pass by anything done by you.
    <br>Therefore, all boasting is excluded.
    <br>He who glories must not glory in himself, but in the Lord.
    <br>These are not brought to pass by anything done by us.
    <br>Therefore, all boasting is excluded.
    <br>He who glories must not glory in himself but in Jesus Christ.
    <br>There is no room for eloquent speech.
    <br>There is no room for man's boasting of his own ability and power.
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>Bow down your head and say to yourself:
    <br>Whatever I will receive from You, Lord, are not brought to pass by anything done by me.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The book of Ephesians 2:8, "For it is by grace you have been saved through faith -
    <br>and this is not from yourselves; it is the gift of God -
    <br>not by works, so that no one can boast.
    <br>For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus ..."
    <br>LEAVE IT FOR GOD!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul.
    <br>Our spiritual advantage results from our union with Christ.
    <br>It appears that all is of grace
    <br>because all our spiritual advantages are from the Lord Jesus.
    <br>Our faith, our conversion, our eternal salvation
    <br>are not from the mere product of any natural ability.
    <br>No man should boast.
    <br>LEAVE IT FOR GOD!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Our faith, our conversion, our eternal salvation
    <br>are not from the mere product of any natural ability or power.
    <br>No man should boast.
    <br>Let someone say: No man should boast.
    <br>He who glories must not glory in himself, but in the Lord.
    <br>Of all graces, faith honours Jesus the most.
    <br>Of all graces, Christ honours faith the most.
    <br>The work of healing, deliverance, salvation, just name it -
    <br>these are not brought to pass by anything done by us.
    <br>It is not the ability to inspire, it is not your eloquence, it is not your knowledge of the Bible.
    <br>God has ordered all so that the whole should appear to be of grace.
    <br>As a Christian, when you understand this philosophy
    <br>you will continue to strive, press in.
    <br>After struggling, after our hard work, God will still have to mark our work.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: God will still have to mark my work.
    <br>After my struggling,
    <br>after my hard work,
    <br>God will still have to mark my work.
    <br>You say, "I have done it. Look at it. I did it the best. I am the best candidate. Why should they give me this?".
    <br>No. As a Christian, after struggling, after our hard work, God will still have to mark our work.
    <br>"Yes. You want me to carry this? To where?". "That place".
    <br>After we have done everything humanly possible,
    <br>we must leave the issue with Him.
    <br>Let someone say: Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul.
    <br>After struggling, labour, after our hard work, God will still mark our work.
    <br>He is the Beginner and the Finisher.
    <br>Let someone say: Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul.
    <br>A regenerated sinner becomes a living soul.
    <br>After struggling, after our hard work, if we succeed, we must give all the glory to God.
    <br>If we fail, we must submit to His will.
    <br>We may not know when our time is coming.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I may not know when my time is coming -
    <br>like a bird suddenly caught in a trap,
    <br>like a fish suddenly caught in a net.
    <br>Everyone has a divine course.
    <br>The way and manner God executes His plan in people's lives differs.
    <br>Can you see the reason why you should not compare yourself to others?
    <br>You just say, "I raised him. Look at my life. He's better than me. I trained him".
    <br>The way and manner God executes His plan in people's lives differs.
    <br>This is why we should give Him all the glory when we succeed -
    <br>and when things seem to go otherwise, say, "Thank You, Lord".
    <br>Today, many have changed their destiny, their history
    <br>through an inability to see beyond their immediate situation.
    <br>"I must travel to ... because of that". You fake the visa, you fake this, you try to get this, you try to do other,
    <br>not knowing that the reason why you have not had that breakthrough is to prepare you for the greater challenge.
    <br>But you have changed your destiny, the history.
    <br>Who knows, if your prayer for a better position had been answered,
    <br>who knows what would have happened to you?
    <br>Who knows what would have happened to me
    <br>if my prayer for better conditions
    <br>- better conditions to be a senator,
    <br>better conditions to be president,
    <br>better conditions to be the chairman of the companies -
    <br>who knows what would have happened to me if my prayer for better conditions had been answered.
    <br>LEAVE IT FOR GOD!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Let someone say: Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul.
    <br>Let's consider some notable, Biblical characters - the way and manner they reacted to their situation.
    <br>1 Samuel 17:45, "David said to the Philistine,
    <br>'You come against me with sword and spear and javelin,
    <br>but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty,
    <br>the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
    <br>This day the Lord will hand you over to me,
    <br>and I will strike you down and cut off your head.'".
    <br>LEAVE IT FOR GOD!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>David gave all the glory of his victory over Goliath to God,
    <br>saying, "Here, you will see today that God does not use sword,
    <br>spear and javelin to save His people".
    <br>One would think that men of great understanding in the art of management would be men of substance.
    <br>But today, we see many a good man unnoticed, uncelebrated, in obscurity.
    <br>We have many of us here today - you are at the peak of your profession.
    <br>But today, you are working under someone you have lectured or you have trained in the past.
    <br>That is grace.
    <br>One would think that men of great understanding,
    <br>masters in their area of profession, would be men of substance.
    <br>But many a good man everywhere - unnoticed.
    <br>Many a good man everywhere - uncelebrated.
    <br>Many a good man everywhere - in obscurity.
    <br>One would think that in the battle, in warfare, numerous soldiers should always be victorious.
    <br>Remember what happened to Elisha and his servant.
    <br>He came out in the morning and saw the chariots
    <br>and he ran back to his master and said, "Master, these people are too numerous".
    <br>The master said to him, "Those who are with us ...".
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Those who are with me, fighting for me, securing me, protecting me, are more!".
    <br>Common sense says that numerous soldiers should be victorious with weapons and armour.
    <br>But in the grace of God ...
    <br>LEAVE IT FOR GOD!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Today, we have seen many things happen.
    <br>The most beautiful ladies, handsome men - many of them are going around looking for a partner to marry,
    <br>while ugly men and ugly ladies are getting married every day.
    <br>LEAVE IT FOR GOD!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Let someone say: Grace In The Soul.
    <br>Let's look at the case of Joseph.
    <br>Genesis 50:18, "His brothers then came and threw themselves down before Him".
    <br>'We are your slaves,' they said."
    <br>They were his 'boss' previously, and now became his slaves.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Be careful. Your servant today may be the one to help your children.
    <br>Someone we call a housemaid may be the one to be the saviour of your own children.
    <br>Look at what happened. "His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him".
    <br>'We are your servants. We are your slaves now', they said.
    <br>"But Joseph said to them, 'Don't be afraid'.
    <br>'You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish His purpose'".
    <br>God often brings good out of evil.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: God often brings good out of evil.
    <br>Joseph said to his brothers, "You thought evil against me, but God meant it for good".
    <br>As a Christian, your situation may be to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>As a Christian, your situation may be to strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>As a Christian, your situation may be to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>As a Christian, your situation now may be to preserve you for redemption.
    <br>The end has not come; the best is yet to come.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The end has not come.
    <br>When we do not know what will happen next, that will make us to watch and pray.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You can never tell when your time is coming -
    <br>like a bird suddenly caught in a trap,
    <br>like a fish suddenly caught in a net.
    <br>LEAVE IT FOR GOD!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>If we know what will happen next, we are likely not to watch and pray.
    <br>Today, many have changed the history of their life through inability to see beyond their present situation.
    <br>That the situation I am in now may look like sickness, but there's no real evil in it.
    <br>Somebody said, "Operation". After the operation they could not find anything. They closed the wound.
    <br>We have seen many that merely enter the restroom to relieve themselves. The next thing, they find a fibroid.
    <br>While thousands are going for operations to remove them.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Many have changed the history of their life through inability to see beyond their present situation.
    <br>If you know that your situation now is meant to prepare you for the challenges ahead ...
    <br>We have seen people that spend many years in the prison - from prison to the throne.
    <br>In the Bible, even in our generation - from the prison to the presidency.
    <br>This shows that imprisonment is meant to preserve them.
    <br>Imprisonment is meant to prepare them for the challenges ahead.
    <br>Imprisonment is meant to strengthen their desire.
    <br>Imprisonment is meant to keep them for a new level in life.
    <br>LEAVE IT FOR GOD!!! TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Ask your neighbour: What is your own imprisonment condition?
    <br>Your imprisonment condition could be sickness.
    <br>Your imprisonment condition could be setback.
    <br>Your imprisonment condition could be failure.
    <br>Your imprisonment condition could be isolation.
    <br>Your imprisonment condition, your dry pit, could be any foolish thing.
    <br>Your imprisonment condition could be poverty.
    <br>What is your own imprisonment condition?
