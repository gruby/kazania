    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mziwoxolo Nkqayi, I come from South Africa.
    <br>I work as a police officer in SASP (South African Police Service).
    <br>Good morning, church.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>I grew up as a person who did not know God.
    <br>I would go to church only when I saw my wife and children going to church.
    <br>Going to the church was not what I used to do because I did not know God.
    <br>I would go to church once in five or seven years.
    <br>To me, since I did not know God, I felt like something must be happening in church.
    <br>I thought that they only preached about giving ten percent.
    <br>I felt like whenever they saw me in the church, they would only preach about giving ten percent.
    <br>How can you preach to a person who does not know God, saying, “Throw money”?
    <br>I hope we understand what our brother is saying.
    <br>He grew up from a background he did not know God,
    <br>he was very rarely attending church,
    <br>and he realised that anytime he went to church the sermons that were usually preached
    <br>revolved around giving money and this discouraged him from even attending church.
    <br>Go ahead, sir.
    <br>As I became busy, I wanted to know God.
    <br>I didn’t know what it was but it kept telling me that I must seek the face of God,
    <br>I wanted to go to church.
    <br>There was one particular night I slept and in a dream, I saw a man I have never seen.
    <br>He had a dark skin colour and was not too tall but was a bit taller than me and had a lot of hair.
    <br>This dream I had was vivid in my mind.
    <br>Even during the day, it was too vivid so I started to think that I must do something about it.
    <br>Then, I remember when I was growing up, there were the elders who used to ask us
    <br>about our dreams and associate them with ancestors.
    <br>I started to think that I might need to go for a ritual and see the elders
    <br>to tell them about the man I saw when I was asleep.
    <br>Something happened.
    <br>I was sitting at home, scrolling channels to look for one where I could listen to the Word of God.
    <br>I saw this man that I saw when I was asleep, the man I had never seen anywhere.
    <br>As I was watching, I discovered that it was Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I wanted to know where the church was because of people sharing very interesting testimonies.
    <br>I told myself, “I want to go to The SCOAN. Where is the church located?”
    <br>As I was watching, I realised it was the prophet who I had dreamt of.
    <br>Then I became so happy because I was no longer thinking about going to slaughter a cow.
    <br>The person I saw in the dream – I could see he was a pastor.
    <br>The first day, I was listening to his preaching and he was telling the congregation,
    <br>“Believe and see” – that was the scripture that he was telling the congregation about.
    <br>I was very interested in what the prophet was going to say and he said, “Believe and see”.
    <br>I kept on watching Emmanuel TV and on the screen it was saying, “Touch the screen”.
    <br>I would touch the screen and pray with the Prophet.
    <br>I kept telling my family that I would be promoted next year.
    <br>My family could not understand and asked what I meant by ‘next year’, when I applied already.
    <br>I said it was because I would go to Nigeria to get the Morning Water
    <br>so that I could minister it to myself and then I would be promoted.
    <br>My family didn’t understand what I was talking about but I kept touching the screen and praying
    <br>as if I was in The SCOAN.
    <br>“Out! Amen!” – it was like I was in The SCOAN.
    <br>Whenever Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed, I would pray along with him.
    <br>For the post that I applied to, applicants were so many – more than 80
    <br>and one person was needed to fill that post.
    <br>People who had applied for this particular post had many qualifications
    <br>which we cannot even mention all of them but I applied.
    <br>I was waiting and I received a phone call that I must come because I was promoted.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>By the grace of God, I was promoted to the next rank, ‘Captain’.
    <br>I was in a warrant officer rank and in my country, it is those who are marching in one place.
    <br>Many people retired in that rank; it is not easy to be promoted to another rank.
    <br>But now, by the grace of God, through praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>you are promoted to the rank of a captain in a South African Police Force.
    <br>By the grace of God, I am a captain in SAPS.
    <br>As I grew up, I noticed that I had diabetes.
    <br>I would go to the doctors and the result would show that I had diabetes.
    <br>I was always on diabetic treatment.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN because I always wanted to step my foot in The SCOAN.
    <br>I told myself, “I will go to The SCOAN. I don’t know how much it will cost
    <br>but I will be in Lagos, Nigeria. I want to be in The SCOAN.”
    <br>In April, I came to The SCOAN on my own and was opportuned to get the Morning Water
    <br>and receive a touch from the man of God.
    <br>My results are here.
    <br>On 11th of May, I went to my doctor.
    <br>I don't know what for I went to that doctor.
    <br>I realised that I no longer have diabetes and it was only a month after I came back from Nigeria.
    <br>If you look at the result, it is written that when I went for the test on 08/01/2016,
    <br>the rate of my sugar level was 15.1 mmol/u.
    <br>After I came to The SCOAN, my sugar level went down to 6.6 mmol/u
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>The test was on 11th of May.
    <br>Just before I came to The SCOAN in the beginning of September,
    <br>the doctor told me that I didn’t have diabetes anymore and I was healed.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Not only was our brother promoted, he was also healed from diabetes
    <br>and we give all the glory to God Almighty.
    <br>When I had diabetes, I used to go to the toilet frequently.
    <br>During the night, I would go to the toilet seven to eight times and my wife wouldn’t notice.
    <br>I no longer have diabetes.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I was not a Christian but now I am a Christian.
    <br>I can feel that I am a Christian and I became a Christian through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I would also advise people that we need to follow Jesus Christ like children following their parents.
    <br>We need to seek the living church; we should not stay in a church because we are in high positions.
    <br>We need to follow Jesus Christ like children following their parents.
