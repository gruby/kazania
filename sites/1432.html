    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Ok, remove it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>You can go. Go, go, go!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord! Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! My husband can walk.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I can walk!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am healed! Hallelujah!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Stacy Roy George. I'm from the United States of America.
    <br>The person next to me is my lovely wife.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN with severe pain, difficulty in walking.
    <br>I've had two knee replacements in my leg.
    <br>The situation got worse.
    <br>I've had surgery again in November, and the pain just got even worse.
    <br>So I couldn't do much or nothing.
    <br>I couldn't sit long, I couldn't stand long.
    <br>I'm a minister.
    <br>I preached and I would be down for a week, two weeks.
    <br>I travelled - I would be down for two weeks.
    <br>Just real bad - difficulty and pain, taking painkillers every day.
    <br>I've taken as much as four painkillers a day, other muscle relaxers and other medicines.
    <br>There was no improvement; it was getting worse.
    <br>My wife is a doctor.
    <br>They would get pain medicine to help me get through the day and sleep at night.
    <br>No good.
    <br>Painkillers is not the answer.
    <br>Jesus is the answer. Amen.

    <br>Healed Of Torn Knee Cartilage
    <br>No Longer Using A Knee Brace
    <br>I was introduced to Emmanuel TV through my wife
    <br>and I saw all the miracles that are happening at The SCOAN on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I knew that if I got here, that God would heal me. Amen.
    <br>We came by faith, we didn't have an appointment.
    <br>We didn't know what we were going to do.
    <br>We just knew that God had a plan.
    <br>We came to the prayer line last week.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - when he laid hands on me, it was over.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It was over! Hallelujah!
    <br>It was over! Amen!
    <br>I haven't taken any pain medicine; the pain medicine is gone!
    <br>Hallelujah! I don't sleep with pain medicine!
    <br>It is all over! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Mr Stacy Roy George & Wife
    <br>Healed Of Torn Knee Cartilage
    <br>No Longer Using A Knee Brace
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Mr Stacy Roy George & Wife
    <br>Healed Of Torn Knee Cartilage
    <br>No Longer Using A Knee Brace
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Mr Stacy Roy George & Wife
    <br>Healed Of Torn Knee Cartilage
    <br>No Longer Using A Knee Brace
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>This is exactly what our father couldn't do.
    <br>This is Jesus! Hallelujah!
    <br>The message I have for viewers all over the world:
    <br>No matter what you are going through, trust and believe in God.
    <br>God will make a way.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Dr Maria George. I'm coming from Tanzania.
    <br>I'm here to glorify the goodness of the Lord
    <br>for what God has done in our lives, in the life of my husband.
    <br>The Bible says, we defeat the devil by the word of testimony and by the blood of the Lamb.
    <br>I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for putting himself in the position whereby God uses him mightily.
    <br>We came here by faith last week, with my husband having difficulty in walking.
    <br>He was so much in pain; I was holding his hand.
    <br>We travelled together all the way to here.
    <br>When we reached The SCOAN, we had the opportunity to get into the prayer line.
    <br>My husband was put in the prayer line.
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua had touched him, I saw him walking, running.
    <br>We glorify God for what He has done in our lives.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>The word of advice I want to give all people: They have to have faith,
    <br>faith in God, and they should watch Emmanuel TV
    <br>because if it wasn't for Emmanuel TV - I watching it and introducing my husband to it -
    <br>I told him to watch it and believe that one day, God will do it for him.
    <br>As people are getting healed, touched and delivered by God, your time will also be coming.
