  <p>    
    <br>My name is Nkoyo Udo from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>The person next to me is my sister and her baby.
    <br>Mrs Nkoyo Udo & Family
    <br>Akwa Ibom, Nigeria
    <br>This one next to her is her in-law. This is my sister. This is my sister and her husband.
    <br>Mrs Nkoyo Udo & Family
    <br>Akwa Ibom, Nigeria
    <br>We are here to share a wonderful testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>It all started November 2017
    <br>when my sister went to the hospital for delivery.
    <br>When she went, the doctor tested her and told her that she would not be able to deliver
    <br>without an operation.
    <br>And immediately the doctor made mention of operation, we were scared
    <br>because of what was involved.
    <br>And immediately my sister called me, I rushed down from the office to the hospital.
    <br>I told the doctor that he should wait. That he should let me seek the face of God first.
    <br>I picked up my phone. I called the prayer line.
    <br>That this was what was happening.  The person at the prayer line told me, "No problem.
    <br>That in every situation God is saying something.
    <br>That nothing will happen to my sister and the baby".
    <br>I had faith in these words.
    <br>And we tried.
    <br>We couldn't succeed normally like that and later resolved on having the operation.
    <br>My sister still underwent an operation.
    <br>Before the operation, the doctor told me that they were trying inside to see
    <br>how they could remove the baby but it was not possible. They had to use forceps.
    <br>When they were using the forceps, due to mismanagement, the baby got injured.
    <br>As it was a private hospital, they didn't have the equipment to treat the baby.
    <br>The doctor then transferred my sister and the baby to the General Hospital.
    <br>When they went there, the situation became worse.
    <br>They first asked, "What happened to the baby before they transferred the baby to the hospital?"
    <br>The baby got injured as you can see on the picture that has been placed here.
    <br>The baby got injured.
    <br>This is the picture of the baby on the screen of the televisión.
    <br>And you can even see right there the baby's brain, which was very, very dangerous.
    <br>When I asked the doctor, "What are we going to do now at the hospital?",
    <br>the doctor told me, "I have not seen such a case before.
    <br>That we need to try; in this situation, it is 50/50".
    <br>I was shocked. I didn't know what to do at that particular moment.
    <br>I told my sister, "What I want to do is that ... I believe in the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He will never disappoint me.
    <br>Being a member here and also a partner, that stepping my feet here at the arena of Liberty,
    <br>that indeed, I will come back with a testimony".
    <br>And I came here.
    <br>When I came here in November 2017, I was opportune to be placed in the prayer line.
    <br>When I was in the prayer line, the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>At that time, I used this picture you saw on the board as the medium of contact
    <br>because I couldn't bring my sister and the baby down to The SCOAN.
    <br>When the man of God was praying for me, I believed in my mind,
    <br>"Definitely, he is praying for my sister right there at the hospital".
    <br>I was also opportune to be given the New Morning Water.
    <br>I rushed down to the hospital when I went back to my state, Akwa Ibom.
    <br>I administered the New Morning Water on the baby on the first day and the mother.
    <br>With regard to the mother, after the operation, the wound refused to close.
    <br>The doctor told me, "We tried. It didn´t close. We are going to stitch her again".
    <br>I said, "No, doctor! It will be very painful and you should not do that".
    <br>My sister was still crying and I said, "What am I going to do?"
    <br>I told my sister, "Just calm down. When I come back from where I want to go,
    <br>definitely you will have a testimony".
    <br>When I returned from The SCOAN, I put a demand on the annointing in this place.
    <br>Because my papa, my mentor T.B. Joshua, usually says that in every situation God is still saying something
    <br>and our situation is not like that of others. These words motivated me.
    <br>I rushed from Akwa Ibom State down here and was privileged to get the New Morning Water.
    <br>I administered that New Morning Water on the baby and my sister.
    <br>Surprisingly - tell your neighbour, "Surprisingly" -
    <br>the wound began to close, close, close, close.
    <br>This was something the doctor told me before I left,
    <br>"My sister, I don't think it will be possible for the next eight months
    <br>for this baby to be here in the hospital".
    <br>I then asked, "What happened? How are we going to get the money
    <br>because drugs there on a daily basis - you buy one for 10.000, 15.000, 7.000 -
    <br>before we knew it, all that we had got exhausted.
    <br>We didn't have money again. I said, "Ok, this last money that is remaining,
    <br>let me rush down to The SCOAN".
    <br>So when the wound started closing, brethren, I was surprised.
    <br>After four days...
    <br>Hallelujah! We can see on the screen the same spot where the baby was injured
    <br>and the sore was widening and widening until the sister came to The SCOAN
    <br>with a picture of the mother and the baby and interceded on their behalf,
    <br>received prayer from the man of God and got the New Morning Water.
    <br>She went back to meet the baby and the mother in the hospital,
    <br>ministered the New Morning Water and the wound that was so wide and so deep that you could see the brain
    <br>of the little baby started closing up and that is the result we can see today.
    <br>It is completely healed. Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus!
    <br>As there was not enough blood in my sister, they stored the fibroid when they did the operation.
    <br>They couldn't remove the fibroid because of the blood.
    <br>And at that particular time there was no blood to transfuse.
    <br>And the fibroid was still there. After three days, my sister began to swell up everywhere -
    <br>I was shocked! I said, "How can I lose two people at the same time! God forbid such a bad thing!
    <br>I cannot serve a living God and be disappointed". I was crying.
    <br>I was praying. I was meditating and indeed God of T.B. Joshua that I serve did wonders!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>After three days of ministration of the New Morning Wáter, I had a dream.
    <br>The man of God appeared to me in my dream
    <br>and told me that he was just coming for me and the baby alone, not for any other person;
    <br>that I should rush to the hospital and bring the baby.
    <br>I did. I rushed down and brought the baby to him.
    <br>I didn't even know what the man of God put on the baby's head at that spot
    <br>but I saw his hand like this on the spot.
    <br>When I saw the hand, the man of God prayed for the baby and said, "Take the baby.
    <br>She is free. She is healed".
    <br>Mrs Nkoyo Udo & Family
    <br>Akwa Ibom, Nigeria
    <br>The baby I'm talking about is not far away -
    <br>she's here, right here in our midst.
    <br>Immediately after the dream, after one week, the wound closed totally.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>At the earlier stage, before I came to The SCOAN, the doctor told me
    <br>that they had not seen such a case before, the wound was too wide,
    <br>the baby's brain had opened and they couldn't do anything
    <br>but they were going to do what they could - medically.
    <br>When the doctor came out and told me that, I told him
    <br>that I believe that the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua is still saying something
    <br>and definitely, He will still say something.
    <br>So when I went back and administered the New Morning Water,
    <br>and the doctor saw that the wound was completely closed, he was surprised.
    <br>One of the nurses that saw when I administered the New Morning Water on the baby asked me,
    <br>"Madam, I saw you holding something in your hand. What was that?"
    <br>I told her, "Madam, do you care to know what I was holding in my hand that day?"
    <br>She said, "Yes, because I have not seen this kind of thing before.
    <br>This wound is not even up to two months and the baby is completely healed!"
    <br>I told the doctor that it was the New Morning Water from The SCOAN; where I belong.
    <br>And today, this is my sister and this is the baby.
    <br>They are completely healed to the glory of God!
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus! Let´s clap for Jesus one more time!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Inobo Akban and the baby I'm carrying is my daughter, Destiny Akban.
    <br>I´m from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>My sister has said it all!
    <br>I was the one that was in pain. I was sick. I didn't know anything.
    <br>Even the hospital that they transferred my daughter to, it was my mother that stayed with my daughter
    <br>at that hospital for four days before the doctor told me to go and stay with my daughter at the hospital.
    <br>When my sister came back from The SCOAN, that was when I knew that I am a living soul.
    <br>Now I feel very happy!
    <br>I'm glad that my baby is alive. I am alive.
    <br>When I saw the wound at the Teaching Hospital, I was crying all through.
    <br>When my health was bad, when I was down, I was even asking God, "Why?
    <br>Why this pain for a baby that is just coming into the world and that has not done anything,
    <br>that does not not know anything?"
    <br>But God was still consoling me.
    <br>My sister tried her best as a sister to rush down to meet the man of God.
    <br>The head that I was unable to touch at that time, now I can touch that place.
    <br>I can touch my baby's head.
    <br>Everywhere was soft. It was only this place that was strong on this head.
    <br>But now everywhere is strong. Praise the Lord!  Emmanuel!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>My advice to the whole world and the people that are seated here
    <br>is that when you have a problem, when you are terrified,
    <br>don't run to satan, don't run to a witch doctor,
    <br>run to God because God is the Author and the Finisher of everything.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>So, let's just hear a word or two from a brother here.
    <br>Tell us your name and who is the woman to you?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ennis Akban.in-law.
    <br>The woman here by my side is my sister-in-law - the wife of my elder brother.
    <br>I'm here to thank God for what God has done for our family
    <br>because what no man can do is very possible before God
    <br>and He has all the ability to change things.
    <br>We are so amazed and so surprised to see this kind of thing happen.
    <br>That's why we all came as a family to thank God.
    <br>I want to thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We had been hearing this name, and my sister kept on telling us to come.
    <br>We never thought it was this kind of thing.
    <br>I have seen proof and evidence; that's why I believe in Him.
    <br>The Bible says,  "Believe God and you will succeed.
    <br>But when you believe the prophets, you shall prosper".
    <br>So that's why we all came because we now believe what we have seen.
    <br>I say, "May the Lord bless him".
    <br>And I want to advise everybody:
    <br>The devil only comes to intimidate you.
    <br>Don't allow whatever he brings your way to take you to a witch doctor
    <br>because you will lose direction.
    <br>Every problem coming to you, God wants you to take that problem to Him
    <br>because He has something to do in your life. Blessed be the name of the Lord!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesús!
    <br>Thank you very much.  Thank you.
    <br>Finally, sister, what is your word of advice?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My advice first goes to the people who are still yet to partner with EmmanuelTV.
    <br>I want to advise you that you should not delay anymore.
    <br>Since I started partnering with this ministry, I have not been disappointed in life.
    <br>I have seen so many things happening to me -
    <br>breakthrough in my career, finances, in so many ways.
    <br>Then secondly, to the viewers all over the world
    <br>and to those that are seated right here in this auditorium.
    <br>I want to advise you that in every situation, God is still saying something;
    <br>that in God, there is no impossibility.
    <br>With God, everything is possible.
    <br>Any situation or challenge - because our Papa, T.B. Joshua, my mentor usually says
    <br>that it is not any other thing than a mere challenge.
    <br>Anything you came here with today,
    <br>believe that as you're going, you're going with a testimony.
    <br>Thank you.  Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>We want to congratulate the baby's mother and the baby
    <br>for the wonderful healing that has taken place in the life of this child.
    <br>We also want to encourage you to remember that you were healed by the grace of God through His Word.
    <br>So make His Word the standard for your life
    <br>and also train up this child in the way of the Lord so that when she grows up, she will not depart from it.
    <br>Remember, for God Almighty to save the life of this child,
    <br>it means that God has a purpose for her life.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace to train her up in the way of the Lord, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Once again, let´s clap for Jesus!
