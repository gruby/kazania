    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Everywhere You Go
    <br>Viewers all over the world, prepare your hearts to receive
    <br>and get ready to pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, God Almighty will take you from glory to glory.
    <br>Pray along with faith, in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I want to specially pray for those who are sick
    <br>and you believe what you are facing is beyond you.
    <br>You are not going to sleep on the bed of sickness today.
    <br>Let us go. You evil spirit, you must listen!
    <br>I say, listen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You, evil spirit, listen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The cause of infirmity! You are the cause of infirmity.
    <br>You are the cause of setback, limitation in progress,
    <br>disease, sickness, failure and yoke.
    <br>You, evil spirit, listen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It must leave you because you belong to Jesus.
    <br>I belong to Jesus.
    <br>There is no more condemnation.
    <br>There is no condemnation.
    <br>There is no condemnation, no guilt.
    <br>I belong to Jesus.
    <br>You, evil spirit, listen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you, out of my business!
    <br>You, evil spirit, listen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It must listen because you belong to Jesus.
    <br>It must listen because I belong to Jesus.
    <br>No more condemnation.
    <br>No more guilt.
    <br>It must listen; I belong to Jesus!
    <br>I belong to Jesus!
    <br>It must listen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>As you continue to offer this prayer in your home, church, household,
    <br>it is prayer God has given to you; offer it.
    <br>I belong to Jesus; no more condemnation.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>you belong to Jesus; there is no more condemnation.
    <br>You belong to Jesus; there is no more guilt.
    <br>Evil spirit is behind those things -
    <br>failure, setback, limitation in progress.
    <br>I say to you, you belong to Jesus; no more condemnation.
    <br>Evil spirit, listen! In the name of Jesus, I command you out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your word will not go without results.
    <br>Open your lips and say after me,
    <br>I belong to Jesus; no more condemnation.
    <br>No more condemnation for those who belong to Jesus.
    <br>No more guilt.
    <br>You, evil spirit, the author of failure,
    <br>the author of sickness,
    <br>the author of disease,
    <br>the author of fear,
    <br>I command you, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>I command that sickness, I command that disease.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>where can you go from His presence?
    <br>From East, North, South, West, all over,
    <br>whatever position you are in,
    <br>whatever sickness or disease you are facing,
    <br>listen to me those of you that hear my voice.
    <br>This is the voice of God.
    <br>I declare war over your disease and sickness!
    <br>This is battle!
    <br>I declare battle over your sickness and disease!
    <br>I say you, disease and sickness, you, infirmity,
    <br>whatever disease, whatever sickness within your blood or fluid,
    <br>I command it out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Just begin to touch those areas you feel pain,
    <br>Are you on the sickbed? Are you in the wheelchair?
    <br>Fibroid, cancer, ulcer, hypertension, diabetes,
    <br>no matter the name you call it,
    <br>never a sickness or disease Jesus cannot heal;
    <br>never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say: You, only, can heal!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That disease in your blood, that sickness in your bones,
    <br>that sickness in your flesh, that disease in your tendon,
    <br>Father, thank You for the cure.
    <br>Father, thank You for Your healing.
    <br>Father, thank you for Your touch.
    <br>As you are giving thanks to God,
    <br>whatever disease, whatever sickness you are having,
    <br>you, dry bone, I command you, right now, to rise again, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being blessed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When I say, I can see you being blessed, say,  "I am blessed!"
    <br>When I say, I can see you being cured, say, "I am cured!"
    <br>I can see you being cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being blessed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Check yourself.
    <br>Nothing is impossible to the Word of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Nothing is impossible to the Word of God.
    <br>He cures, He heals, He blesses!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>When you speak the Word of God, nothing is impossible.
