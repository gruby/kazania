  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Anne.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The message you are about to listen to this morning is a revelation from the Throne of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I pray that as you listen to this message, the Lord will speak to your heart,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>But before I go any further, I want to say:
    <br>You are welcome
    <br>In the name of the Lord
    <br>I can see in you
    <br>The glory of the Lord
    <br>You are welcome
    <br>In the name of the Lord
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us be seated in His presence.
    <br>I believe you will all agree with me that as humans
    <br>perfect people do not exist on this earth.
    <br>Because I know I'm not perfect and I don't know if there is anybody here that is perfect.
    <br>Perfect people do not exist on this earth.
    <br>We do not exist as perfect people;
    <br>that is why we keep looking for areas where we can change and improve.
    <br>To be able to identify and acknowledge these weak areas in our lives is a part of the solution.
    <br>Knowing that answer, that weakness, will be 50 percent of the victory.
    <br>Pride cannot travel this path - only humility.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Pride will never look back to reflect on where it's coming from.
    <br>The Book of Zechariah 4:10 says, "Do not despise these humble beginnings..."
    <br>In other words, do not forget the place you started.
    <br>Where would I be
    <br>You only know
    <br>I'm glad You see
    <br>Through eyes of love
    <br>A hopeless case
    <br>An empty place if not for grace
    <br>Amazing grace
    <br>How sweet the sound
    <br>I once was lost
    <br>But now I'm found
    <br>A hopeless case
    <br>An empty place if not for grace
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Most times in life, when we find ourselves in position of honour and glory,
    <br>we tend to forget when, we tend to forget where,
    <br>we tend to forget how we began.
    <br>We forget our planting season.
    <br>We forget the watering season -
    <br>when we were watering that plant, that seed of tomorrow.
    <br>We never forget the harvest time.
    <br>This is why some of us will boast about our achievements
    <br>as if we were originators of our own strength,
    <br>while others feel worthless because their strengths and abilities do not stand out.
    <br>As a Christian, when you begin to value your ego more than your conscience
    <br>or you place your ambitions above your salvation, you grieve the Holy Spirit with pride.
    <br>James 4:6 says, "God opposes the proud but He gives grace to the humble".
    <br>Now the question is: What does pride do to you and I?
    <br>Pride will mask the true condition of your heart,
    <br>dim the eyes of your understanding, distort your vision.
    <br>Pride will make you see yourself as a victim
    <br>and not a perpetrator or architect of your fate condition.
    <br>That is why our attitude then becomes that of,
    <br>"I was mistreated.
    <br>I was cheated.
    <br>Oh, I was misjudged. People don't understand me."
    <br>This is pride.
    <br>Pride will make your best friend become your worst enemy.
    <br>Pride leads to discontentment and discontentment has a logo.
    <br>Tell somebody, "Discontentment has a logo".
    <br>Look at your neighbour and say, "Discontentment has a logo".
    <br>What is that logo?
    <br>Nothing is ever enough.
    <br>Discontentment has a logo: Nothing is ever enough.
    <br>Discontentment will make a man want to be a woman.
    <br>Discontentment will make a woman want to be a man.
    <br>Discontentment will make your best friend become your worst enemy.
    <br>Discontentment can even make your worst enemy become your best friend,
    <br>not for God's sake but for selfish, classic and material reasons.
    <br>Discontentment will make a fair person want to become black.
    <br>Discontentment will make a black person want to become fair.
    <br>Discontentment will make a fat person want to be slim
    <br>and make a slim person to be fat.
    <br>Discontentment will make a short-hair person to want to have long hair
    <br>and the long-hair person wants to have short hair.
    <br>When a man continues to crave for something that is beyond him,
    <br>that discontentment will lead to rebellion.
    <br>When a man constantly craves for something that is beyond him,
    <br>that discontentment will ultimately lead to rebellion.
    <br>What is rebellion?
    <br>Rebellion is placing ourselves where God has not placed us.
    <br>Rebellion is putting oneself in the position of God.
    <br>God always loves to place us where it pleases Him.
    <br>Look at the Book of Jeremiah 29:11.
    <br>God said , "The plan I have for you is good and not evil."
    <br>He always wants to place us where it pleases Him.
    <br>Discontentment and rebellion is placing ourselves where God has not placed us.
    <br>Rebellion makes us act more like God's enemies than His friends.
    <br>The Bible says that rebellion against God is as bad as witchcraft
    <br>and arrogance as sinful as idolatry.
    <br>The Book of Proverbs 17:11 says, "Evildoers foster rebellion against God.
    <br>The messenger of death will be sent to them."
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>Proverbs 17:11 says, "Evildoers foster rebellion against God.
    <br>The messenger of death will be sent against them."
    <br>Common to all viewpoints is the fact and truth that rebellion willfully opposes God
    <br>and will result in judgement.
    <br>For example:
    <br>In Isaiah 14, God created Lucifer to be the most magnificent of all the angels
    <br>but his rebellious desire to become God saw him sent to the pit of hell
    <br>and banished for eternity.
    <br>In Genesis 2, God gave Adam the entire Garden of Eden to possess, to own.
    <br>His rebellious desire - to eat just one forbidden fruit.
    <br>After God gave him the entire garden, he still wanted the forbidden fruit.
    <br>His rebellious desire separated him from the presence of God.
    <br>In Genesis 11, God unified the world with one language and one speech;
    <br>everyone spoke the same language, understood themselves.
    <br>But their rebellious desires, their rebellious acts, threw the world into confusion
    <br>and today, you and I suffer the effects of that division.
    <br>What are the effects of division?
    <br>Moral oppression, institutionalised corruption in high places, religious intolerance,
    <br>demonic and physical oppression.
    <br>We mean diseases and disabilities everywhere.
    <br>In Numbers 32, the children of Israel's constant rebellious actions against God
    <br>caused them to wander for 40 years in the wilderness
    <br>before they could finally enter the Promised Land.
    <br>Rebellion against God is as bad as witchcraft and as sinful as idolatry.
    <br>Our small and large acts of rebellion prove that man is indeed a descendant of Adam.
    <br>However,
    <br>God Almighty had a plan in motion to overcome the effects of man's rebellion -
    <br>and the entire Bible is the story of how that plan unfolds,
    <br>ultimately leading to God's visit to earth through His Son, Jesus Christ.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This will lead me to the title of the message:
    <br>MAN AND HIS REBELLIOUS NATURE
    <br>Say, "Man and his rebellious nature".
    <br>Touch yourself, say, "Man and his rebellious nature".
    <br>My proof text will be taken from the Book of Numbers 16:1-31.
    <br>But specifically we will be reading the verses 1-3, 19-20 and 31.
    <br>At your free time, you can take your time to read from verse 1 to 31.
    <br>I read:
    <br>"Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites -
    <br>Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth - became insolent
    <br>and rose up against Moses.
    <br>With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders
    <br>who had been appointed members of the council.
    <br>They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them,
    <br>'You have gone too far! The whole community is holy,
    <br>every one of them, and the Lord is with them.
    <br>Why then do you set yourselves above the Lord's assembly?' "
    <br>Go to verse 19.
    <br>"When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them
    <br>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
    <br>the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire assembly.
    <br>The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
    <br>'Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once.' "
    <br>Finally, let's go to verse 31.
    <br>"As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart
    <br>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households
    <br>and all Korah's men and all their possessions.
    <br>They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned;
    <br>the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community."
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>The five unique temptations of a Christian can be spelt out with five words:
    <br>Fear, greed, ego, pride, and rebellion.
    <br>In tempting the children of God, satan's greatest aim is to distract us
    <br>and overthrow our position as children of God, thereby cutting off our dependence upon God,
    <br>our duty to God, our devotion to Him, our commitment and communion with God.
    <br>This is why the higher we go,
    <br>the higher these temptations try to take our time, our mind, our loyalty off our Creator.
    <br>They begin to increase gradually in our character.
    <br>Before you know it, we begin to desire - for ourselves -
    <br>the glory and honour that belongs to God.
    <br>You, who say today, "I need wealth. I need blessing. I need position.
    <br>I need influence. I need power":
    <br>Be aware that all high places are slippery places;
    <br>therefore, watch and pray.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Christians seek not yet repose
    <br>Hear thy guardian angels say
    <br>Thou art in the midst of foes
    <br>Watch and pray
    <br>Genesis 2 makes us understand that the life we live is not ours;
    <br>it is the Spirit of God that has chosen to give us this mysterious and miraculous gift of life.
    <br>When God formed man from the dust of the ground,
    <br>there was nothing fanciful about the chemical elements making up man's body
    <br>until God put His breath of life into him.
    <br>God is so much concerned about us because not only are we His work of art,
    <br>but most importantly, we are the dwelling place of His Spirit.
    <br>God wants to build character in us so that when we get to the place of our destiny
    <br>we will not crack, we will not explode and we will not lose it all.
    <br>Let me make a simple demonstration here.
    <br>Picture yourself as dust,
    <br>before God put His breath of life.
    <br>God wants to build character in us.
    <br>Today, man is like dust.
    <br>I need somebody to help me hold it up.
    <br>Sir, thank you very much.
    <br>Today, man...
    <br>Remember, we were formed from the dust of the ground.
    <br>This is what man is - like dust,
    <br>blowing around here and there, everywhere without the breath of God, the Spirit of God
    <br>because we have lost the essence of our lives.
    <br>This is man.
    <br>Today, man is like clay that will soon crack and explode and lose it all
    <br>because we have lost the breath of God, the Spirit of God,
    <br>which is the final touch, I mean the finishing touch to our moulded existence.
    <br>If you walk without the Spirit of God, you walk without the Father.
    <br>If you walk without the Spirit of God, you are dust and clay.
    <br>If you walk without the Spirit of God, you walk without instruction,
    <br>you walk without direction, you walk without revelation.
    <br>So, child of God,
    <br>stop cultivating desires to act on your own because the life we live is not ours.
    <br>This life is not our own
    <br>We are just passing through
    <br>Our treasures are laid up
    <br>Somewhere beyond the blue
    <br>The angels beckon us
    <br>From Heaven's open door
    <br>And we can't feel at home
    <br>In this world anymore
    <br>Of course we can't feel at home in this world.
    <br>We have lost the essence of life;
    <br>we have lost the final touch - the finishing touch - to our moulded existence
    <br>because we have lost touch with the breath of God.
    <br>The Bible says, "The Spirit of God gives life; the flesh counts for nothing."
    <br>Picture yourself, picture your life.
    <br>God sometimes will permit, when He sees that we are going too far because of pride,
    <br>He will permit sickness, He will permit setback,
    <br>He will permit disappointment in order to humble us
    <br>to keep us from losing salvation
    <br>but rather than learning obedience by those things which we suffer, we begin to grumble, "Why me?"
    <br>We begin to complain, "What is happening?"
    <br>You know what we do next, child of God.
    <br>We start running.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We start running,
    <br>running from the very things that are supposed to bring strength into our lives.
    <br>We start running,
    <br>running from salvation.
    <br>When we accept adversity, enduring every pain,
    <br>we will learn what we should know and our grief will turn to gain.
    <br>What is that situation of yours?
    <br>You, that are complaining, "I am depressed. I am disappointed. I am sick.
    <br>What is happening to me?"
    <br>You look around; no way forward, no way backwards - you continue to complain.
    <br>Jesus is saying:
    <br>Learn obedience and stop running; turn back to salvation.
    <br>Tell somebody, "Learn obedience and stop running; turn back to salvation."
    <br>Turn back to salvation because to learn obedience is to follow God's processing
    <br>and God's processing requires commitment.
    <br>If you need to learn what you should know so that your grief will turn to gain,
    <br>learn obedience, follow God's processing.
    <br>Processing requires commitment.
    <br>Jesus Christ's objectivity was founded on commitment and genuineness of faith.
    <br>The day you make a total commitment to Jesus Christ, you have declared war against satan.
    <br>Ask yourself, "Have I made a commitment?"
    <br>The day you make a total commitment, you declare war against satan
    <br>and you will be tested and tried to be sure that you mean what you profess.
    <br>After that, commitment will ask Jesus to accept you.
    <br>When Jesus accepts you, He will begin to take up your challenges.
    <br>Apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 12:10,
    <br>"For when I am weak, then I am strong.
    <br>For when I am sick, then I am healed.
    <br>For when I am poor, then I am blessed.
    <br>For when I am lost, then I am found."
    <br>Let the weak say I am strong
    <br>Let the poor say I am rich
    <br>Let the blind say I can see
    <br>It's what the Lord has done in me
    <br>Hosannah
    <br>To the Lamb that was slain
    <br>Hosannah
    <br>Jesus died and rose again
    <br>Come on, give it up for the Saviour.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In conclusion:
    <br>Let's look at the Book of Job 23:10,
    <br>and hear what Job is telling us about tests and trials.
    <br>The Book of Job 23:10.
    <br>"But He knows the way that I take; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold."
    <br>Job is telling us here that Jesus Christ will have nothing to do with a man
    <br>that has not been made sensible by the vicissitudes of life.
    <br>Jesus Christ will have nothing to do with you and I,
    <br>if we have not been made sensible by the vicissitudes of life.
    <br>When I say, "A heart that has not been made sensible,"
    <br>I mean a man that has not been made sensible by disappointment,
    <br>a man that has not been made sensible by sickness,
    <br>a man that has not been made sensible by poverty,
    <br>a man that has not been made sensible by the vicissitudes of life.
    <br>For those whom Christ wishes to admit into the most intimate acquaintance with Him,
    <br>He first makes them sensible to realise how undeserving of His grace they ordinarily are.
    <br>Those whom Christ wishes to admit, or those whom Christ must admit or adopt into His family -
    <br>they must first be tested.
    <br>And some of these tests are what many of us are going through
    <br>and we keep crying...
    <br>We keep wailing, we keep complaining; battling flesh and blood,
    <br>looking for a scapegoat.
    <br>Today you will say your father is the wizard,
    <br>tomorrow your mother is the witch,
    <br>next tomorrow - my sister is my enemy.
    <br>The Bible says:
    <br>What can separate us from the love of God?
    <br>What can separate you from the love of God?
    <br>Nothing!
    <br>Nothing can separate us from the love of God.
    <br>That is why we can boldly sing:
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>No turning back
    <br>I love this part.
    <br>The Cross before me
    <br>The world behind me
    <br>No turning back
    <br>Anyone can claim, "Jesus is Lord" but that "Jesus is Lord" must go through tests and trials.
    <br>The Holy Spirit must confirm it.
    <br>God has ordered all that the whole should appear to be of grace.
    <br>This means that our faith, our conversion,
    <br>our eternal salvation are not mere products of man's natural ability or power
    <br>but the result from the union in Christ Jesus through the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Love is the only genuine principle from which that union can spring.
    <br>Let love take precedence over all.
    <br>Child of God, if you have not learnt to treasure God,
    <br>if you have not learnt to value His prophets,
    <br>if you have not learnt to appreciate the life God has given you,
    <br>then you are one with a rebellious spirit that is in conflict with everything around it,
    <br>you are a rebellious spirit that is bound, burdened and most of all useless as an instrument.
    <br>Assess your love for God right now
    <br>so that you may not receive the judgement you truly deserve, for God is merciful.
    <br>He can withhold His punishment from us because His mercy drove Jesus to the Cross for our sake.
    <br>Repent and become committed to a new way of life - from disobedience to obedience,
    <br>from unfaithfulness to faithfulness and from doubt to faith.
    <br>Return back to salvation.
    <br>If you say this prayer we are about to pray now with me and you mean it from your heart,
    <br>it will be a soul-saving and life-changing prayer.
    <br>Let's bow down our heads and pray.
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit to cast out of you every spirit of disobedience.
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit to cast out every thought that stands against God's will and purpose for your life.
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit to cast out every spirit of rebellion in your life.
    <br>Rebellion is as bad as witchcraft and sinful as idolatry.
    <br>Rebellion makes us God's enemies rather than His friends.
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, anywhere you are watching us,
    <br>I know that this message is right now at the centre of your heart.
    <br>Ask God to give you a willing and obedient spirit to be able to follow Him day by day
    <br>and hour by hour.
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit to take more of you and give you more of Him.
    <br>We know that this message is at the centre of your heart.
    <br>Ask Jesus to give you a willing and obedient spirit -
    <br>a spirit that will defy the voice of disobedience, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
