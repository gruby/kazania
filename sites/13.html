    <br>DON'T GIVE UP! | Viewers Prayer with TB Joshua
    <br>Viewers, it's time to pray with Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>and take your place in the believer's authority to break the grip and hold of the devil over your life.
    <br>Anywhere you are in the world,
    <br>place your hands wherever you have pain or discomfort or whatever constant experience
    <br>you have been having and let the precious blood of Jesus Christ wash it away right now.
    <br>Now is the time to restore every breakthrough  key which sin has stolen from you.
    <br>As the prophet prays for you begin to experience the joy of salvation 
    <br>and receive the breakthrough keys to your good health, your marital life, your finances, your business, career 
    <br>and your destiny in the name of Jesus Christ. Your challenge, if it is allowed by God as a trial -
    <br>do not see it strange and begin to doubt your God, instead count it all joy that your opportunity for victory 
    <br>is at hand. As you pray with prophet T.B Joshua right now, you will see that
    <br>God's power is so real, so authentic and so forceful that it cannot be limited by space and time.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, be encouraged, when God corrects you.
    <br>Whatever your challenges are,
    <br>your challenges could be sickness, poverty, backwardness,
    <br>back luck, rejection, limitation in progress, marital problem -
    <br>I don't know, God knows.
    <br>Whatever your challenges are, are a way of correction, if you are a Christian.
    <br>Don't give up! If you are a Christian, don't give up.
    <br>I want you to see it as a reason for believing God,
    <br>just as you see your good time.
    <br>See your pain as a reason for believing God,
    <br>just as you see when money is in your pockets,
    <br>just as you see when food is on the table.
    <br>See it, if you are a Christian!
    <br>Whatever experience you are having now, it is time to put an end to it.
    <br>Our God gives good health when we are sick.
    <br>Our God gives blessing, when we are poor.
    <br>Our God gives freedom.
    <br>Right now, are you ready?
    <br>Every constant experience of poverty, sickness, disease, backwardness, bad luck, limitation in progress -
    <br>right now in your life, be washed away by the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Be flushed out by the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, flush them out!
    <br>Every constant experience of limitation, backwardness, rejection, marital problems -
    <br>right now in your life, be flushed out by the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to flush them out.
    <br>Begin to wash them away.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
