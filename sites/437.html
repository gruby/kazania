    <br>It is time for prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "My heart knows that the case is settled."
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>If the case is settled, 
    <br>it means that you are healed.
    <br>Say: "I am healed!"
    <br>"I am delivered!"
    <br>"I am blessed!"
    <br>"My heart knows that the case is settled."
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Right now before we open our lips, begin to give thanks to God for your healing.
    <br>Give thanks to God for your deliverance.
    <br>Give thanks to Him for your blessing.
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>In Jesus  Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Whatever situation you are facing, the root is demon.
    <br>I say, whatever situation you are facing, demons are the cause.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>So right now, the Lord wants to deliver you from this demon.
    <br>Right now open your lips.
    <br>You demon, my body is the temple of Holy Ghost.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to rebuke that demon in your life.
    <br>Rebuke it!  
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>I rebuke that demon in your life!
    <br>That spirit that causes you lust,
    <br>be rebuked, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever spirit that causes you destruction,
    <br>say: "You spirit, I curse you, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Be cursed!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Whatever that occupies your conscience, your heart, I declare you free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say - be opened!
    <br>Be opened for the Holy Spirit!
    <br>Say: "Holy Spirit!"
    <br>Holy Spirit!
    <br>Say: "Whatever is occupying my body, my spirit, my soul - I declare you out!"
    <br>Out!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever chain demon might have used to connect you to himself -
    <br>it could be chain of poverty, chain of sickness, chain of disease,
    <br>chain of affliction, infirmity -
    <br>begin to break it! 
    <br>Break the chain!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I break whatever chain satan is using to connect you!
    <br>Be broken!
    <br>That your situation is a chain.
    <br>You are disconnected!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the name of Jesus, I command that disease,
    <br>that affliction,
    <br>that disease!
    <br>Right now, begin to cover yourself with the blood of Jesus.
    <br>Cover yourself with the blood of Jesus!
