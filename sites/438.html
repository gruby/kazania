    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua was ministering prayer to the congregation at the Monday live prophetic service
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ, a man cried out to him for his special attention.
    <br>I am a blasphemer.
    <br>Are you a pastor?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You are a blasphemer?
    <br>Yes, sir. I have a confession to make.
    <br>The confession is that we have been praying that God should take away your power.
    <br>We are PFN (Pentecostal Fellowship Nigeria) in Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>I came to meet you. I have never seen a pastor like you.
    <br>I have never seen your type.
    <br>Why were you people praying to take away my life?
    <br>We were seeing you as an anti-Christ.
    <br>And even that the Anointing Water was initiation into the marine world.
    <br>We said it was bewitching. The people were mesmerized; they'd just dance and fall
    <br>and that it was not real power from Heaven.
    <br>Why?
    <br>These are lies of the enemy. I have come here for forgiveness.
    <br>That's why I came so that it would be well with me.
    <br>So you are a pastor?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>So, all the pastors in which state?
    <br>Anambra.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You people were praying that God should take away my life?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>And humble you.
    <br>Okay, thank you. I want to see you, sir.
    <br>Go and wait for me.
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Pastor Chidi Daniel;
    <br>a pastor with Grace of God Mission in Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>I also belong to the PFN (Pentecostal Fellowship Nigeria).
    <br>Based on the information from our superiors, those I highly esteemed, I was ruined.
    <br>That was the position.
    <br>I was appointed as music and crusade director and as such, I went around
    <br>saying what they told me to say - that was a fallacy -
    <br>that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, sleeps with snakes and lives in the water.
    <br>You can imagine...
    <br>And because of this, I went about telling people not to go to The SCOAN.
    <br>I said it was an anti-Christ church and "the synagogue of satan"
    <br>where nothing good can come out from.
    <br>Because I said these things, I didn't know I was ruining myself too.
    <br>The problems continued for me.
    <br>I didn't know where to turn to.
    <br>My children and family were ruined.
    <br>I lost my wife because of breast cancer, and my children died in an accident.
    <br>I got married to another woman but there was a problem. She left and went to her people.
    <br>The ministry was in shambles, and I didn't know what to do.
    <br>I asked myself, "What is wrong? I'm preaching the Gospel and it is a gateway to blessings.
    <br>Why is my case an exception?"
    <br>I was confused.
    <br>I went to visit one of my cousins who is a doctor, and I watched Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw miracles that looked incredible, and I wondered.
    <br>My cousin said that this was hypnosis, that they were being mesmerized
    <br>and that when they were dazed, they collapsed on the ground.
    <br>Then I saw the Anointing Water.
    <br>I saw healing, deliverance and all manner of miracles through the Anointing Water.
    <br>I said that this man was living in the water and that this was another dimension of initiating people too.
    <br>I refused to accept the miracles and the authenticity of the mercy of God to humanity.
    <br>I was always seeing the negative side and there were repercussions upon my life and ministry.
    <br>Other pastors who watched Emmanuel TV were always telling me
    <br>that the miracles were not real but stage-managed. You can't believe it.
    <br>Even on Monday after my confession, three pastors called me.
    <br>I know that these are people that have Emmanuel TV in their homes.
    <br>But they are like the 'old' pharisees who stand on the way,
    <br>not allowing people to enter into their miracles.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have discovered that the appointment as a crusade director has amounted to disappointment
    <br>and has brought ruin. My body is sick. Nothing is working.
    <br>I asked another friend of mine who is a medical doctor.
    <br>He told me that I have a confession to make, that I used to speak evil against the man of God
    <br>and that the Bible says that sin against man can be forgiven
    <br>but sin against the Holy Spirit would never be forgiven.
    <br>I didn't have the courage to come to The SCOAN
    <br>after I had told people that nothing good can come out of this place.
    <br>It was a difficult situation for me.
    <br>I still went back to watch Emmanuel TV in another pastor's house.
    <br>Then I met another pastor who told me that I had wronged an authority in Christ.
    <br>I said, "I have never insulted any man of God. Who could it be that I have insulted?
    <br>T.B. Joshua of The SCOAN, do we call him a man of God?"
    <br>The pastor told me, "You have missed it. Are you the one who makes people men of God?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is the one who can deliver you. You must go to him for deliverance".
    <br>It wasn't easy for me to come; it was another mountain before me.
    <br>I had to summon up courage, and I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I came on Monday.
    <br>The wise men came and attended to me. I thank God.
    <br>When finally the man in the Synagogue, the man anointed, the man of the now...
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua appeared, he was very humble;
    <br>he didn't look like us who dressed to intimidate.
    <br>I saw what I had never seen among my fellow preachers and old founders who are bishops.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua hugged me. He laughed. He took pictures with me. Oh, what a simplicity!
    <br>What a humility! What a compassion!
    <br>Somebody even asked him for his Bible and he gave it to him.
    <br>I said, "No, I have not seen this kind".
    <br>Something was saying within me, "If we can produce these types, there will be peace in Nigeria".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Since I came, I have seen it in another way;
    <br>I see the place as an institution in your life and your word.
    <br>No one can see you on the road and believe that you are a Holy Ghost machine!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm sorry, man of God. I have sinned against the Holy Ghost and the Anointed of God.
    <br>Please, have mercy on me.
    <br>He has been troubled for the past one week.
    <br>I think he has expressed his feelings.
    <br>My relationship with my Nigerian pastors, God is aware.
    <br>If my people had seen what is happening here clearly,
    <br>you people from other countries wouldn't have access to me.
    <br>Now God will begin to open that understanding.
    <br>You know, this is the church of all nations.
    <br>My country's position should not be more than half percent.
    <br>If they had seen and accepted me in the beginning, it would have disturbed my mission to the world.
    <br>It is the will of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If they had accepted me and seen me clearly, it would have disturbed my mission to the whole world.
    <br>This church would have become a Nigerian church and it is not only a Nigerian church.
    <br>God is aware.
    <br>What they have been doing from the beginning was never a sin - God is aware.
    <br>I repeat again. God decided to allow that to happen.
    <br>God can use any foolish thing.
    <br>He used that to keep me for the nations and the whole world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Just believe you are my father, you are my brother.
    <br>Your pain is my pain now.
    <br>Your trouble is my trouble, your pain is my pain.
    <br>Two believers are better than one.
    <br>Thank you very much. Hallelujah.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
