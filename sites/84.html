    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>Twenty-five year old Mr. Ganiu Sulaimon from Kwara State, Nigeria,
    <br>has come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations with an excruciating problem of leg cancer.
    <br>He gets up from the seat to show the very place the cancer has developed.
    <br>The camera closes in to get a closer shot of the wound.
    <br>You can see that the skin of his entire leg has severely deteriorated.
    <br>Flaking dead skin; symptoms of the cancerous infection that has enveloped his right leg
    <br>This condition has gone beyond the power of nature,
    <br>that no medical technology or medicines can solve this man's problem.
    <br>It can only be treated, but it cannot be healed.
    <br>This problem has become a curse, and who can remove the curse?
    <br>It is none other than Jesus Christ
    <br>1 Peter 2:24 to 25 says, "He bore our sins in His body on a tree,
    <br>so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness."
    <br>By His wounds, we are healed.
    <br>Mr. Ganiu Sulaimon waits in faith at The SCOAN's prayer line,
    <br>believing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever,
    <br>and that just an encounter with Him through His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>will bring perfect healing in Jesus' name.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has arrived at the prayer line as an ambassador of Christ,
    <br>sending God's appeal through him, that Jesus Christ is the master healer,
    <br>and that He heals for the salvation of their souls.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The pus and poisonous substances that were compressed under the skin,
    <br>instantly begin to gush out of his leg, and pour out on the ground.
    <br>What is happening to Mr. Sulaimon?
    <br>This is beyond human comprehension.
    <br>This confirms what Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians, chapter 2, verse 4:
    <br>"My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words
    <br>so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on Godâ€™s power."
    <br>The woman rolling on the ground is Mr. Ganiu Salaimon's mother
    <br>jubilating at what Jesus Christ has done for her son.
    <br>Mr. Ganiu Salaimon begins to walk in the light of his testimony, testifying that the pain has gone.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Look at the boy! The boy is now walking; walking majestically.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>To God be the Glory!
    <br>Mr. Ganiu Salaimon is completely healed after receiving prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Mr. Ganiu Salaimon and his mother walk victorious down the prayer line,
    <br>giving thanks to Jesus Christ for His healing power and deliverance
    <br>Who is like Jesus? Who is like the Lord?
    <br>There is absolutely nobody like Jesus Christ.
    <br>On the left, we saw Mr. Ganiu Salaimon suffering with an excruciating problem of leg cancer,
    <br>but on the right, you can see Mr. Ganiu Salaimon's skin completely restored
    <br>after receiving prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua in Jesus' name.
    <br>His leg is now perfectly healthy.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Tapping the area where the leg cancer once was,
    <br>Mr. Ganiu Salaimon testifies that he no longer feels any pain.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>The problem that brought me here was leg cancer.
    <br>I had been to many hospitals, but all to no avail.
    <br>I could not walk, stand, or go to the toilet on my own.
    <br>I had to be carried to the restroom.
    <br>When the pains became unbearable, I lost hope that I would ever walk again.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua stretched his hand towards my leg and prayed for me.
    <br>He then told me to rise up.
    <br>Immediately, it burst open and all the cancerous substances started gushing out of my leg.
    <br>Mr. Ganiu Salaimon rolls up his trousers and testifies that Jesus Christ has set him free.
    <br>He once again taps the area where the leg cancer formerly was,
    <br>Mr. Ganiu Salaimon: There is no pain; I am free now.
    <br>Demonstrating that he is healed.
    <br>He says there is no more pain.
    <br>This is a confirmation that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is indeed the power of God
    <br>for the salvation of everyone who believes. Romans 1:6.
