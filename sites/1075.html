  <p>    
    <br>- How are you?
    <br>- I'm fine.
    <br>- From where?
    <br>- From South Africa.
    <br>What did you hear me say?
    <br>That my faith shouldn't be based on the improvement after prayer.
    <br>Your faith should not be based on the improvement.
    <br>What should your faith be based on?
    <br>I should be patient. If God does not answer, it doesn't mean that it is no.
    <br>It means He is waiting for the right time.
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Before now, how have you been living your Christian life when it comes to prayer?
    <br>I've been praying but sometimes when I see things don't come my way, I lose hope.
    <br>But this time?
    <br>But this time, because of your message, I will be strong.
    <br>You are healed already.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You have received Jesus; you are healed to heal others.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Touch your leg.
    <br>The other one.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>I'm not there; I'm here.
    <br>Here I am; I'm not there.
    <br>I'm not there; I'm here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What happened?
    <br>[Power of God.]
    <br>I said, "What happened?"
    <br>[Power of God.]
    <br>Ah - power happened.
    <br>I said, "What happened?". You said, "Power!" What is power?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is all. This is what we've been talking about.
    <br>This is just it.
    <br>What happened is that Jesus immediately came to the scene.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>What happened?
    <br>Jesus immediately came to the scene.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I can walk now!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I can walk now! I am healed!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Lerato Motsoari from South Africa.
    <br>I had a problem of lymphedema.
    <br>That is, the circulation was not okay in my feet so it caused a blockade down there.
    <br>You would see a lot of water not flowing the correct way.
    <br>I couldn't walk for a long distance and I couldn't stand for long.
    <br>I would feel pains and discomfort.
    <br>That really caused a lot of problems.
    <br>Even when I wanted to buy shoes, I would struggle to find them in the right size.
    <br>My self-esteem was low. I'm a teacher.
    <br>When the learners were looking at me when I was wearing a skirt,
    <br>I would feel uncomfortable because they could see that my feet were not equal.
    <br>One foot was too big and the other one was little.
    <br>You mean the problem affected your teaching career.
    <br>Yes, I had to stand for long and standing was a problem because of pains.
    <br>On Sunday, I came; I was sittng over there.
    <br>The man of God came and said, I should touch my feet.
    <br>I did that. I don't really know what happened after that.
    <br>I asked people, "Did the man of God pray for me?"
    <br>They said, "No, he didn't pray for you".
    <br>I don't really know what happened.
    <br>You mean you cannot explain what happened to you after the Prophet had asked you to touch your legs?
    <br>No, I can't really.
    <br>I can walk without any discomfort.
    <br>I don't feel any pains now.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>This one, I could not tap it like this.
    <br>I would start feeling a lot of pains.
    <br>It would tell me that I had walked too much or tapped it a lot.
    <br>So, I would feel discomfort.
    <br>If I walked a lot like a long distance, my feet would swell up
    <br>and the discomfort would come again.
    <br>But now, are you feeling any pains?
    <br>I'm feeling okay; I can twist it like that.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>This is how my feet used to look like - they were big.
    <br>But now, they are no longer big.
    <br>I used to struggle to find the right shoe size.
    <br>When I wanted to buy new shoes, I would have to check the ones that are comfortable
    <br>because immediately when my feet swelled up, I would feel the pain too much.
    <br>But now, I believe I can buy any type of shoes.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Jesus Christ is still the Healer. We have to believe in Him. That's all.
    <br>You are healed by Christ's Word. You should go and live by that Word.
    <br>Make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>so that the healing and deliverance that God has given you
    <br>will remain permanent in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
