  <p>    
    <br>Let us listen to what Prophet T.B. Joshua said about the Kenyan elections on Sunday 1st January, 2017.
    <br>Let us hear the voice of God.
    <br>Thank you, sir. You have answered all of my questions as to why I am here.
    <br>Now, since 2017 is a wonderful year, I love my nation, Kenya, and we are having elections.
    <br>I am asking that God visits me in dreams, so that I know how to pray about my nation.
    <br>God bless you, sir.
    <br>You want to take me back to what I have written.
    <br>Even your country is one of the countries that is inside the paper there.
    <br>If I may tell you just a bit of what is inside that paper.
    <br>They will be very, very close like this
    <br>and it will be difficult to call.
    <br>I will not say more than that.
    <br>Can you see? When something is close like this, and it will be difficult to call...
    <br>So, I don't want to go back to what is in the paper
    <br>because it's one of the things in the paper.
    <br>It will be very close like this -
    <br>the opposition and the ruling.
    <br>It will be very, very difficult to call.
    <br>From there - I will not be able to say more than that.
    <br>I am not here for that now.
    <br>So, therefore, what can you expect from there?
    <br>So, I will see you. Thank you.
    <br>So, you love your nation so much?
