  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith comes by hearing.
    <br>That is why we need to hear about healing anointing.
    <br>That is why we need to hear about blessing anointing.
    <br>That is why we need to hear about delivering anointing.
    <br>I will take it again.
    <br>Faith comes by hearing.
    <br>That is why we need to hear about what? - Healing anointing,
    <br>deliverance anointing and blessing anointing.
    <br>Faith comes by hearing.
    <br>We all know Jesus always responds to those who put a demand on Him.
    <br>Always.
    <br>He always responds to those who put what? - A demand on Him.
    <br>What a blessing to teach people who are hungry for the Word!
    <br>You know..
    <br>When you have people who are hungry for the Word and you are teaching them - what a blessing!
    <br>So I believe I'm in the midst of people who are hungry for the Word.
    <br>Are you one of them?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Thank you! Hallelujah!
    <br>Now the job is half done; you have scored fifty percent.
    <br>I say you have scored fifty percent.
    <br>If you even decide to leave from here now
    <br>and then maintain the one you have received, it is OK.
    <br>So let's talk about maintenance.
    <br>Hallelujah!! What we have been listening to since morning,
    <br>if you can meditate over it, over and over and over...
    <br>This is what your enemy does not want you to hear!
    <br>You know many times when you are at home and you are listening to Emmanuel TV,
    <br>there are a lot of distractions.
    <br>So the time you have to pay attention to what you hear now is always difficult for you out there
    <br>because there are so many things to attend to.
    <br>So I want to say congratulations once again!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let us pray for the viewers.
    <br>We want them to have the right focus
    <br>because you know what it means if you are out there, in the midst of confusion, distractions.
    <br>Here, you switch off your set.
    <br>You don't want to hear anything; you have so much grace.
    <br>But over there, our viewers at home, anywhere they are,
    <br>we know the situation they are in - so many distractions.
    <br>So let us pray for them and ask God to give them the right focus in the midst of all.
    <br>Stretch your hand. Let's pray together.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we want to be like Jesus in our heart.
    <br>We pray for right focus, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever is disturbing you right now -
    <br>our heart is always going up and down, thinking about this and that -
    <br>leave it for God!
    <br>We pray for right focus, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right focus, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to receive a hearing heart!
    <br>A hearing heart!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith comes by hearing.
    <br>That is why we need to hear about about what? - Healing anointing.
    <br>And once you hear it, put a demand on it.
    <br>When the healing is going on, put a demand on it. If you are sick, you will be healed.
    <br>Blessing anointing - when you hear it being pronounced on a person
    <br>and you need blessing, put a demand on that blessing anointing
    <br>and you will be blessed!
    <br>How do we put a demand?
    <br>Get connected; just believe.
    <br>If there is actually God in the true processing -
    <br>true processing means that it is given to us for free and we shall give it to you for free -
    <br>without the exchange of money.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Deliverance cannot take place without God's processing.
    <br>Healing cannot take place without God's processing.
    <br>Blessing can never...
    <br>If somebody says, "I am blessed",
    <br>are you sure it is God's blessing, or are you talking of man's blessing?
    <br>If it is God's blessing, it must go through God's processing.
    <br>There is a process for everything.
    <br>Processing is more important than the result itself.
    <br>You say you are rich. Okay, a rich man.
    <br>How you become rich is bigger than your riches - your result.
    <br>Processing is bigger than the result itself.
    <br>How you get there is bigger than getting there.
    <br>This is the problem with people -
    <br>everybody wants to be big and get there by following any processing.
    <br>No! The processing will help you to maintain the result.
    <br>If the processing is tampered with or if the processing is not God's processing,
    <br>you will not be able to maintain that result.
    <br>So you say, "Oh yes! You become rich".
    <br>What processing takes you to those riches?
    <br>It matters because to maintain those riches, you need that processing.
    <br>If it is not God's processing and you get there, you cannot maintain the riches.
    <br>It will disappoint you at a dear time you need it.
    <br>That is why you see people who were very rich and today they are poor.
    <br>Very rich. At the time of need, the money is gone.
    <br>They say, "Ah! The man is there, he is just..."
    <br>It is all about processing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Healing must go through God's processing.
    <br>So processing is greater than results
    <br>What matters is processing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: What matters is processing!
    <br>What matters is processing.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>What matters is processing.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>What matters is processing
    <br>Again and again!
    <br>What matters is processing.
    <br>It is processing!
    <br>So the manner we process our lives is what is working against us or working for us.
    <br>You want to get married?
    <br>What is the processing of getting married to that man - is it in line with God?
    <br>Or the man is handsome that is why you married that man, or the man has money.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If it is in line with God that you get married,
    <br>that processing will stand for any challenges that you may have in that marriage.
    <br>What can separate men from the love of God?
    <br>Nothing, if the processing is of God.
    <br>What can separate me from the marriage?
    <br>If that marriage follows God's processing, nothing can separate you.
    <br>Nothing that you will hear your husband has done, your wife has done -
    <br>you will still ask God, you want to know God's opinion.
    <br>No matter what happens to the marriage, you still want to know God's opinion
    <br>because God can use any foolish thing to strengthen the marriage.
    <br>Your business today - you jump from one business to another because of crises.
    <br>When you invest in a business and it is not yet coming, you abandon the business.
    <br>You cannot abandon a business because of lust.
    <br>You cannot abandon a business because of sickness.
    <br>You lost, you have spent money, you run bankrupt.
    <br>You can't abandon your business because of those things.
    <br>You can only abandon a business when God says, "Quit!"
    <br>The same thing in marriage -
    <br>you cannot abandon your marriage because of crises.
    <br>You cannot abandon your marriage because of challenges.
    <br>No matter what happens to this marriage, you cannot abandon your marriage because of that.
    <br>Unless God says, "Quit!"
    <br>If the processing of your marriage is in line with God, nothing can separate you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sometimes, God can allow foolish things on our way.
    <br>Those foolish things are college, school - you need to go to school of embarrassment,
    <br>school of praises, school of persecution, school of progress, school of failure.
    <br>Many of you that are here today - if I had not graduated in persecution,
    <br>how would I be telling you of persecution?
    <br>If I had not graduated in accusation, how could I be telling you about accusation?
    <br>If I had not gone through the school of hatred -
    <br>I know much about hatred; people hate me so dearly.
    <br>If I had not gone through and graduated in that,
    <br>how would I be standing here and counsel you about hatred?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is just like that!
    <br>Processing - tell your neighbour!
    <br>Processing!
    <br>Processing is very important!
    <br>This is what Paul meant when he said, "What can separate me from the love of God?"
    <br>Can death, sickness or disease?
    <br>He is talking about processing.
    <br>If his love for God is in line with the scriptures...
    <br>You say, I am a Christian.
    <br>When you become a Christian in line with the scriptures, nothing can separate you.
    <br>Listen again.
    <br>If your marriage is in line with God, with the scriptures, nothing can separate you from that marriage.
    <br>Trouble will come, disappointments will come, failure will come.
    <br>No! It will come! It will just come and strengthen the marriage.
    <br>Even sickness will come - it will just come. After that sickness, the marriage will be strengthened.
    <br>Disappointment will come - they will come and tell you, "We saw your wife in so and so place.
    <br>Your wife is going out with this so and so. Oh, this is the phone number!" You even see the phone number.
    <br>You still need to ask God's opinion about the matter.
    <br>You just need to ask God's opinion about the matter.
    <br>If God brings you to a relationship, the same God will quit you.
    <br>But if you bring yourself to a relationship, you quit yourself.
    <br>How did you come about the marriage?
    <br>When you come to the marriage by yourself and not by God, you quit when trouble comes.
    <br>But when God brings you to a relationship, no matter what happens,
    <br>it is the same God who will quit you when it is time.
    <br>If you have not heard from God, no matter what happens, you must go through it.
    <br>God's processing is the mind of God.
    <br>Now you can say that processing is greater than the result itself.
    <br>If you follow the right processing and you are not getting the result,
    <br>don't worry!
    <br>You are about to get the mother of results.
    <br>You know there is what we call the mother of miracle.
    <br>You do the right thing, but yet, there is no result.
    <br>Don't be disappointed.
    <br>If you have done the right thing and you are expecting the result to come,
    <br>all you need to do is to be patient
    <br>Look at Hannah and Samuel!
    <br>You are about to get the mother of results.
    <br>Look at your case - sometimes you feel sick as a Christian,
    <br>you run to God for prayer.
    <br>The more you pray, it seems that the sickness is still there.
    <br>You keep praying, the sickness is still there.
    <br>It is not that God does not hear you.
    <br>God may realise that that sickness will strengthen you better,
    <br>it will strengthen your desire for Him better than healing.
    <br>He will allow you to go through that sickness
    <br>so that He can strengthen your desire and your determination for Him.
    <br>When we are sick, we keep seeking His face and fast more.
    <br>But the moment we are healed, we relax.
    <br>So when God realises that your going through the sickness will strengthen your desire for Him,
    <br>better than when you are healed.
    <br>Or God may realise that your situation may strengthen your desire, your determination for God,
    <br>to move you closer to God.
    <br>When you have challenges, troubles,
    <br>He will leave you until you are very strong - too strong.
    <br>Then you get healed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He is only concerned about the relationship; it is our relationship that matters.
    <br>Many of us are here today for what you have been asking God to do for you.
    <br>Your business - you want it to prosper. It is not that God does not hear. God hears.
    <br>But God realises that when your business prospers, you are likely not able to sit among your people.
    <br>You will allow this wealth to start controlling you, instead of the source of that wealth to control you.
    <br>When you have so much money, money will now begin to control you.
    <br>I need to go to the meeting,
    <br>I need to go to sign a contract,
    <br>I need to do this -
    <br>instead of the source of that, the One who gave you the money to control you.
    <br>OK, look at it.
    <br>Where you live today, is what your possession can purchase.
    <br>When you live in a village and you have money, you will abandon the village.
    <br>You go to the city because money has come.
    <br>It is nature, it is natural - that is human being for you.
    <br>That if you are living in a village
    <br>and later you have a business and money comes, you will abandon the village for the city.
    <br>It means that it is the money that is controlling us and not the Giver.
    <br>You can be very rich and still remain in that village -
    <br>develop the village, give them light, build your house and live among your people.
    <br>But today, we abandon our people.
    <br>Once the money comes, we go to a better place; we look for our colleagues.
    <br>If you are less privileged and you are rich, you move to the privileged people.
    <br>It is the money that is controlling us. We go into our stature.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Some churches you see arrange for different seats.
    <br>When you just enter a place of worship, you can see that this is where big people sit.
    <br>This is where privileged people sit.
    <br>This is where the less privileged people sit.
    <br>Who is privileged before God? Who is less privileged before God?
    <br>Who is rich before God? Who is famous before God?
    <br>God is concerned about the souls that are saved.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No matter the situation you are in, you can begin to feel the presence of God
    <br>by beginning to have it in your mind that you are not alone
    <br>Like I am here now, I am not alone.
    <br>So, if I want to say something, you check me.
    <br>I would not want to say anything that He would not want to hear.
    <br>You have to engage Him to show that you know Him and that He is with you.
    <br>You have to be talking when someone is talking to you.
    <br>When someone is addressing you, don't remain silent - talk.
    <br>So that you can erase whatever that is not pleasant.
    <br>And on the phone, when you are receiving a phone call - "Hello!"
    <br>You too - when you say that "hello", say another one in the spirit
    <br>to arrest any situation, any message you want to hear.
    <br>"Hello, how are you?" - "Fine."
    <br>"Where are you now?" - "Mmh."
    <br>You say your prayer before you respond.
    <br>That is to show that you are not alone.
    <br>So like you are watching me, you have to be saying your prayer.
    <br>This is how you will start.
    <br>When you start here, you will continue to do that.
    <br>When you start here, you will continue to pray. Like when I am talking to you, you have to say something
    <br>Begin to say something.
    <br>Don't keep silent - if you are silent, your God will be silent.
    <br>If you talk, your God will talk.
    <br>If you are silent, we cannot place you.
    <br>"Mmh." - "T.B. Joshua, how are you?"
    <br>You cannot place me - whether I said fine or not fine.
    <br>"Mmh."
    <br>For you to place me, I have to talk.
    <br>It is still processing; we should cherish processing.
    <br>Let me give you a good example of this word 'processing'.
    <br>I want to pray for you now, but in my heart - now that I am coming to you - I begin to doubt.
    <br>"Will God heal this woman? I don't know."
    <br>"And I am a liar. I don't think God will heal this woman."
    <br>"Will God heal this woman? I don't think God will heal this woman."
    <br>"Be healed! Be healed!"
    <br>God cannot heal because the processing is wrong.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The processing is wrong - from here to where you are.
    <br>What is going through my heart, what is going through my mind -
    <br>it is processing; we call it ingredients.
    <br>To make a soup - if you don't have a good processing in putting those ingredients together,
    <br>you can't have a wonderful soup.
    <br>But when you put those ingredients together - pepper soup or whatever soup you want to make,
    <br>a good one - by the time you finish cooking it, people will enjoy the soup.
    <br>The same way with prayer, the same way with your life,
    <br>the same way with whatever you will become in the future.
    <br>Let us once say, processing.
    <br>Processing.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Processing.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Processing.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Processing.
    <br>The processing of your life is what is affecting you today.
    <br>The processing - how you started.
    <br>At the beginning, in those days, when you said, "If I finish university, I will settle down.
    <br>I will get this, I will get that. I will have a wife.
    <br>I will have children - a boy and a girl.
    <br>It's okay, I will settle down".
    <br>But after you have had all this,
    <br>what you are looking for, you have not yet got it.
    <br>You say, "If I travel to America, I will stay there and work".
    <br>Processing.
    <br>We should cherish processing more  than the result.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>We should cherish processing more  than the result.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>We should cherish processing more  than the result.
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>We should cherish processing more  than the result.
    <br>The processing we are talking about that is not in line with God is the food of witchcraft.
    <br>When you go by a processing that is not in line with God, that is what witchcraft eats.
    <br>When you have something which witchcraft would eat, it will come to you and attack you.
    <br>They eat unfaithfulness, they eat disobedience, they eat hatred.
    <br>They eat pride and you are a very proud person.
    <br>Witchcraft will come to you because that is their food.
    <br>Lying - you know how to lie. Witchcraft will come to you and afflict you
    <br>because the food of witchcraft is lying.
    <br>Disobedience, unfaithfulness, pride, self-centeredness - these are the foods of witchcraft.
    <br>When you go by that processing to build your life, business or career,
    <br>whatever you build in line with all this, you are giving food for witchcraft.
    <br>Witchcraft will be part of you.
    <br>Let someone say, processing.
    <br>Processing.
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>Processing.
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>Processing.
    <br>That's all.
    <br>Cherish processing more than the result.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Cherish processing more than the result.
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>Cherish processing more than the result.
    <br>That you are in line with God to build your career, business, does not mean you will not be attacked.
    <br>But each attack - promotion.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Because if I don't put that one now, you would just say,
    <br>"What this man is saying - I'm in line with God but I'm being attacked".
    <br>If you are in line with God, follow God full step, completely
    <br>in whatever you are doing - faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control and humility -
    <br>to build your life, marriage and children.
    <br>There will be a big attack.
    <br>The bigger your attack, the greater your improvement.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why today when you learn that - "Ah! Something happened to this man!"
    <br>What you will hear from people is, "If it is God's position, if it is God that called him, he will prevail".
    <br>When the incident happened in the church here,
    <br>the mind of everybody was that if he is called by God,
    <br>no Jupiter - the whole world cannot stop him.
    <br>But if he is not called by God, the incident will bring him down.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is what Gamaliel, a professor, said. He said, "Leave this man!"
    <br>"Leave this man!
    <br>If what he is doing is from God, you will not be able to bring him down,
    <br>whatever you do to him you are doing it to yourself.
    <br>Leave him alone!
    <br>But if what he is doing is of man's origin, you will get rid of him".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That you are in line with God, you follow God's steps, step-by-step to build your life,
    <br>does not mean attacks and challenges will not come
    <br>but when they come, each challenge will take you higher.
    <br>Once again - processing.
    <br>Cherish processing more than results.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>When you want to achieve something, what you do to achieve it is better than the achievement.
    <br>Look at your education today.
    <br>You say you are a professor, you are a graduate, you have studied, you face challenges.
    <br>If you know what you went through to achieve the position you have achieved,
    <br>it is the processing that is working against us.
    <br>We get it and leave God behind.
    <br>We can read and understand what we are reading but we don't know that
    <br>education is not success but it is to help us get success.
    <br>There is what we call supernatural gift.
    <br>Human natural gift - when you have this human natural gift,
    <br>you can come out first class, the best student in the school.
    <br>But there is a difference between supernatural and human natural gift.
    <br>You can be the most intelligent, the most brilliant student in the world, coming out first class -
    <br>human natural.
    <br>It is the supernatural that takes us to places with peace of heart.
    <br>That is why it is possible in the world today to be the best in your career.
    <br>Are you a footballer? The best footballer in the world?
    <br>Whatever you are doing -
    <br>speaking skills, ability to inspire - you can be the best in the world
    <br>and yet not believe in God.
    <br>You can do all this without God because all this can be achieved by human natural gift.
    <br>How you process your documents will determine the outcome.
    <br>Cherish processing more than the result.
    <br>Somebody may sit an exam for you, and you may not be the one that sits for it.
    <br>Somebody will do it for you and you come out first class.
    <br>Processing!
    <br>You are not the one that did the exam.
    <br>You carry the certificate; somebody has done it for you.
    <br>That is wrong processing.
    <br>Processing is better, greater than the result.
    <br>These are the challenges we are facing today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say you are a Christian.
    <br>Christianity has a process.
    <br>If all this processing is not right, and you say you are a Christian,
    <br>you will confess Christianity but you will not live the life of a Christian.
    <br>What is the life of a Christian?
    <br>To be a Christian is to be content.
    <br>That is number one.
    <br>The moment you know you are not content, agree with me that you are not a Christian.
    <br>Contentment !
    <br>Whatever anybody becomes, that will not bother you.
    <br>Whether you have little or you don't eat, you will be content.
    <br>Whether you have little money or you don't have money to go there and everybody wants to go there,
    <br>you will be content.
    <br>Contentment is the processing of a Christian.
    <br>It is not how much wrong you experience.
    <br>When wrong comes, how do you handle the wrong?
    <br>As a Christian, when you are wrong, your soul and spirit will be disturbed.
    <br>You are not content.
    <br>You always count day by day.
    <br>Tomorrow, I am so and so here,
    <br>I am so and so there, I have not achieved this.
    <br>I am schooling.
    <br>You are always complaining.
    <br>You are not content; you believe you are being cheated.
    <br>You believe that there are witches and wizards that are after you.
    <br>By your prayer - when you are praying, one can know whether you are a Christian or not.
    <br>If I want to know whether this man is a Christian,
    <br>if I call him now to pray, through his prayer I will know whether he is a Christian or not.
    <br>How do we know Christians? - Through prayer.
    <br>A Christian, because he is content, - he may be sick and will say, "Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I glorify Your holy name, I thank You for today!
    <br>I will continue to thank You for all what you are about to do and all what you have done!
    <br>Thank You!" He will begin to sing, whereas he is sick
    <br>because he has left everything for God.
    <br>He knows that God knows him more than himself.
    <br>But when you are not a Christian, immediately they ask you to pray,
    <br>you say, "God, thank You. I'm sick. Heal me!
    <br>I'm sick. Heal me!
    <br>Please, heal me!
    <br>My brother yesterday was healed, and I am better than my brother.
    <br>Heal me, Lord!
    <br>I have been coming to the church for many years now,
    <br>and this man just came today and he was healed.
    <br>Lord Jesus, don't leave me. Heal me!
    <br>If you don't heal me, I may not come to this church again!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And indeed, he will not come again.

    <br>Look at this.
    <br>If the processing of this carrot is wrong, when you taste it, you will know
    <br>whether it was grown using fertiliser, not natural soil.
    <br>Give me the one that is actually grown in natural soil and the one using fertiliser.
    <br>When you taste it, you will know the difference.
    <br>In fact, the one with the fertiliser affects the health.
    <br>The same applies to those chicken, fish you rear, water, everything - processing.
    <br>Let someone say, processing.
    <br>Processing.

    <br>Many of us are here today for the first time and you have forgotten yourself.
    <br>When you think back, you will realise that every hour, you must take your drug.
    <br>If you don't take your tablet, you will have a fit.
    <br>But today, you have been sitting down for the past six hours, and you have forgotten your tablet.
    <br>You have just forgotten yourself and nothing has happened to you.
    <br>Many of us here - if you were not here, you would have gone to the toilet
    <br>up to six to eight times because of diabetes.
    <br>But for the past seven hours now, you have been sitting down - no toilet.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because Jesus has taken more of you and given you more of Him.
    <br>What is the meaning of that? It means that you have forgotten yourself.
    <br>When you have forgotten yourself, Jesus takes over.
    <br>When you leave from here now, by the time you just move outside there, you will start remembering yourself,
    <br>"Ah, I have diabetes. I have not taken my drug today".
    <br>The moment you remember - urine - you are pressed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you don't forget yourself, you cannot follow Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If you don't forget yourself, you cannot follow Jesus.
    <br>To forget yourself is to forget your challenges, situation, predicaments or worry.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If you don't forget yourself, you cannot follow Jesus.
    <br>Remembering yourself and following Jesus is serving two masters.
    <br>You are serving two masters.
    <br>You follow Jesus and at the same time, you remember your challenges, trouble or worry.
    <br>You are serving two masters.
    <br>You must forget yourself to follow Jesus.
    <br>An example of forgetting yourself is when you sleep.
    <br>My brother, when you sleep, your sickness sleeps.
    <br>Until when you wake up, you will start feeling the pain.
    <br>When you wake up like this, you will start feeling the pain - "Ah, headache!"
    <br>But when you were sleeping, you couldn't feel that pain.
    <br>This is why scientist decide to give you painkillers.
    <br>When they give you this tablet, you will sleep off.
    <br>At that moment, there is no pain but when you wake up, the pain will start.
    <br>That is an example of forgetting yourself.
    <br>In the same vein, when you forget yourself, you have the ability to follow Jesus
    <br>because with Jesus, there is no worry, anxiety, challenges, nothing.
    <br>No! In Him, there is nothing like that.
    <br>That is why when you are following Jesus, challenges are not there.
    <br>In Him, in Jesus, there are no challenges or worries.
    <br>So it is not possible for you to follow Him with your worry, challenges or situations
    <br>because in Him, there is nothing like that.
