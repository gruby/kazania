  <p>    
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua touches the people one by one, praying for them in Jesus' name,
    <br>the Spirit of God exposes this man.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am a lion.
    <br>You are a lion?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How many powers do you have?
    <br>I have many powers.
    <br>I gave him many powers.
    <br>Move like a lion!
    <br>He has a scorpion on his body.
    <br>Where?
    <br>It is here.
    <br>I want to kill this boy.
    <br>These are the powers – one here and one here.
    <br>This is a scorpion; if he hits you, you will fall down and die.
    <br>This is a scorpion.
    <br>If this guy gets angry…
    <br>I gave him the spirit of smoking but T.B. Joshua told him not to smoke again.
    <br>If I enter his dreams, Prophet T.B. Joshua will take the cigarette from my hand.
    <br>This place swells up.
    <br>When he gets angry - what happens?
    <br>If he gets angry and he hits you with this hand, you will die.
    <br>He has hit uncountable people.
    <br>I sent him to Europe.
    <br>This one, if he wants a woman, any woman he likes, if he touches her, she will fall for him.
    <br>After the woman has fallen for him and he has enjoyed her, I will send her away.
    <br>What did you do to his marriage?
    <br>This one is not married.
    <br>He doesn't want to be married.
    <br>We gave him a wife but he did not want her.
    <br>He said he wanted a foolish girl who gave him two children – a boy and a girl.
    <br>I chased all of them away.
    <br>This is the family mark.
    <br>With this mark, anywhere he goes, I follow him.
    <br>Who is he?
    <br>How did you enter him?!
    <br>His grandfather gave him to me.
    <br>I am much older than you.
    <br>You are still young.
    <br>I am 1,500 years old.
    <br>You are still young.
    <br>T.B. Joshua is everywhere, even in his room – why?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Prayer & Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>This boy is your friend; I am not your friend.
    <br>This boy loves you; if anybody wants to argue about it, he will chase the person away.
    <br>Deliverance continues, as Prophet T.B. Joshua touches him again with the lightening power of God,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>He shocked me with electricity; it went in here and out here.
    <br>:)
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>With the final touch of light from the throne of grace, the spiritual battle between light and darkness,
    <br>in the life of this man comes to an end, as the darkness is expelled in Jesus' Christ name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ for setting this captive free.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Right now, you can see on the screen of your TV that gentleman concerned is overcome by emotions
    <br>after what he has just witnessed.
    <br>This is the clear proof that what we saw just now was not him -
    <br>it was the evil spirit within him that was confessing.
    <br>Today, he is delivered, to the glory of God.
    <br>This is the reason we are seeing these tears as an evidence that indeed at that moment
    <br>it was that evil spirit that was speaking and working through him.
    <br>Right now, he is free and he is here to give his confession and testimony, to the glory of God.
    <br>Brother, we understand your emotions - we just ask that you calm down, prepare yourself,
    <br>so that you can share this testimony, so people of God can learn and glory can be given to God
    <br>and shame to the devil.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Muyideen Shittu.
    <br>Mr Muyideen Shittu
    <br>Nigerian Living In Ghana
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Muyideen Shittu.
    <br>I am a Nigerian but I live in Ghana.
    <br>My father is Nigerian.
    <br>He is one of the powerful men in Nigeria.
    <br>He was called 'Red Scorpion'.
    <br>Some people might know my father.
    <br>My story goes like this: when I was young, my father loved me so much
    <br>because I have plenty sisters – 48 sisters.
    <br>So, he put a scorpion tattoo on my arm and told me that anywhere I was,
    <br>no one born of a woman could destroy me.
    <br>I put that idea in my head – I had power.
    <br>Now, I want to confess my sins because I know everything is over.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua saved my life because I had sold my life to the devil
    <br>but Prophet T.B. Joshua brought me back home.
    <br>Mr Muyideen Shittu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>At the beginning, I was a drug dealer and human trafficker.
    <br>I had connections and links everywhere.
    <br>I did it for many years.
    <br>As I was growing up, I was rejected by every teacher and headmaster in school because I always liked fighting.
    <br>I could fight 20 to 30 people but nobody could defeat me.
    <br>I knew where I belonged but now, I belong to Jesus.
    <br>So, you grew up with the strong spirit of anger, fighting and when you became older
    <br>you wanted to travel abroad.
    <br>Tell us what happened.
    <br>I didn't respect anybody.
    <br>Whether they had money, power or whether the person was holding a gun, I didn't respect them.
    <br>I only believed in myself.
    <br>My father told me that I must believe in myself, that nothing would happen to me
    <br>as long as the scorpion tattoo was on me and I believed in myself.
    <br>Mr Muyideen Shittu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I travelled to many countries and saw many things.
    <br>I know that there are some people who are watching me - maybe I did either one business or the other with them -
    <br>I just ask God to forgive me because I was involved in drug dealing and human trafficking.
    <br>I had some elderly people who were my buyers – they were aged between 65 and 70.
    <br>I would ask them whether they needed young ladies to massage their bodies.
    <br>When they agreed, I would negotiate with the ladies, telling them that after staying two years with the men,
    <br>they should ensure that the men willed their properties to them.
    <br>After they collected all the men properties, I would share 50/50 with them.
    <br>However, there was one case that caused a problem.
    <br>The man was my closest friend; at the end of the day, he said I tricked him and he sent mafia to me.
    <br>The mafia told me, "CK, they didn't tell us that it was you. A man reported you to us".
    <br>I told them to forget about him.
    <br>After that, he came back with another mafia group who exchanged bullets with me.
    <br>I was shot on the chest.
    <br>I also shot the man.
    <br>At the end, my neighbour called the police and I was taken to the hospital.
    <br>I was later sentenced to three years imprisonment while the man was sentenced to 20 years.
    <br>I levelled on allegations against him, saying that he slept with children.
    <br>When I left prison, I headed to Germany.
    <br>OK. So, you were imprisoned in Italy over this issue, and from Italian prison you went to Germany.
    <br>When I got to Germany, I started my business again.
    <br>At that time, I joined human trafficking, matching men with women.
    <br>If the women wanted men for marriage, they usually paid four thousand euros
    <br>while I searched for the men who would marry them.
    <br>I worked with big men who would marry them and later divorce after three weeks.
    <br>I would then take 2,000 euros and the man would take the rest.
    <br>Furthermore, I would also approach the crippled to be my customers.
    <br>I would tell them that I had husbands for them and I would take money from both them and their "husbands".
    <br>When they get married, I would warn the man that if after three months,
    <br>he did not leave the woman, I would deal with him.
    <br>After three months, the man would leave the cripple and she would come back telling me her husband had left.
    <br>I would tell them to bring me more money so that I would look for other husbands for them.
    <br>I went to the US and met another gang.
    <br>I lived in California but had another house in Orlando where I operated from.
    <br>In the US, I met a lady from Norway; she didn't know that I was dealing in drugs.
    <br>She always asked me why people kept bringing money to me.
    <br>I told her my father was a king in Africa dealing in gold and that he always sent me money.
    <br>She was convinced with my lies.
    <br>One day, I received a consignment of drugs which I brought to the house.
    <br>The lady had thought it was money but I told her it was not.
    <br>Out of curiosity, she tore the bag and found cocaine powder inside.
    <br>She called her friend and her friend told her it was cocaine.
    <br>She was shocked and while I turned to go to the room, she ran away.
    <br>I later tore every cocaine bag I had into the toilet and flushed them away.
    <br>They finally found out that I was selling drugs.
    <br>So, I had to come back home.
    <br>In 2012, I was sitting on my bed tuning my TV channels and I saw Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Then I didn’t appreciate the value of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Sir, to the glory of God, we just want to talk about the deliverance you received here last week.
    <br>How did you receive your deliverance and what are the changes in your life after the deliverance?
    <br>The only thing I can remember about my deliverance is that I came in front of
    <br>the man of God and he touched me.
    <br>I don’t remember the rest.
    <br>I don’t even remember who took off my clothes.
    <br>I don’t remember anything.
    <br>I just found myself naked.
    <br>So, you just remember the man of God touching you, and that's all?
    <br>Yes. I don’t remember anything.
    <br>Ever since the deliverance, you received last week - can you tell us the changes you've seen in your life?
    <br>After the deliverance, for three days, I've been having the same dream.
    <br>In the dream, I saw people beat me.
    <br>Immediately they slapped my face, the man of God came and everybody ran away.
    <br>So, I asked the man of God why he did not come on time lest they killed me.
    <br>The man of God answered me saying that I was still keeping those people in my mind
    <br>and that was why they could beat me.
    <br>He then prayed for me in the dream again.
    <br>He also told me that whenever I want to sleep, I should say,
    <br>"Lord Jesus, I leave my soul to You. Save me and guide me."
    <br>That was the prayer the man of God gave me in my dream.
    <br>Mr Muyideen Shittu
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Since then, I pray that prayer twice before going to bed and I've not seen those people in my dreams again.
    <br>The evil spirit within me manifested and made me remove my clothes.
    <br>The evil spirit removed everything it had deposited in me and left.
    <br>I did not want the power which belonged to the evil spirit anymore.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God for our brother's deliverance.
    <br>We believe all we have heard from him is enough of a valuable lesson for us - people of God -
    <br>especially young people around the world.
    <br>Today, he is delivered, freed from his past life.
    <br>Satan has used him to destroy so many people.
    <br>He is a living testimony, to the glory of God.
    <br>Brother, we pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance, by making the Word of God
    <br>the standard for your life.
    <br>And we know as you do so, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
