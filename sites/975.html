    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On the 3rd of April 2014, while ministering at The South Korea Pastors' Conference,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophecy concerning a vision God had given him about North and South Korea.
    <br>Here are his words...
    <br>In your country here, whatever threat you are having now is not a threat.
    <br>You people will still come to the table to talk reconciliation between you people and North.
    <br>There is no fight between South and North.
    <br>Whatever threat now, they will still come together and discuss.
    <br>They will not fight but there will be threat, threat, threat.
    <br>There will be threat, threat, threat - gunshot threat - but you people will still discuss.
    <br>There will be reconciliation.
    <br>I am seeing reconciliation coming. Discussion will come.
