  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>East, South, West - He is there.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Today we quickly look at our personal life as a Christian.
    <br>A MAN OF FAITH
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>And some challenges we are facing as a Christian.
    <br>A MAN OF FAITH
    <br>Let's quickly look at the book of 1 Corinthians 10. I will read verse 13.
    <br>"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man;
    <br>but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear."
    <br>This means temptations can come in any form.
    <br>They are not from God but from the adversary.
    <br>If you have faith, you are in Him, that is in Christ, and Christ in you.
    <br>I mean, you are of Christ.
    <br>If you are in faith, you are not satisfied by the world but look beyond it.
    <br>This world is not our home; we are just passing through it, as a man of faith.
    <br>Whether the world laughs or frowns at you,
    <br>you should remember that it is an enemy.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Whether the world laughs or frowns at me,
    <br>you remember that it is an enemy.
    <br>The world means enticement - those things that can entice you.
    <br>You say to me, "Good morning, sir". Maybe I have done something to you, "Good."
    <br>Remember, in John 13: Knowing that Jesus would be betrayed,
    <br>He continued to do what the Father wanted Him to do.
    <br>Like you and I - if I know what you are going to do to me, I become...
    <br>You greet me and say, "TB, you are here to do something. You are an enemy."
    <br>But to Jesus, knowing that He would be betrayed,
    <br>He continued to do what the Father wanted Him to do.
    <br>He taught us by example to serve people
    <br>because we love and obey God, not because we want to be appreciated.
    <br>Appreciation is a good thing but the love of it is bad -
    <br>that you must say 'Thank you' to me ...
    <br>If you don't say 'Thank you', this will not discourage me.
    <br>When Jesus was called the king of Beelzebul, He continued to deliver the devil.
    <br>That could not stop Him.
    <br>Money is a good thing but the love of it is bad.
    <br>When you love money, you love appreciation, you love position,
    <br>you love power, you love authority.
    <br>You cannot stop at anything in order to have it.
    <br>You know what has happened on our continent, why we are poor in Africa?
    <br>Because we carry our mineral resources to collect Dollars and Pounds,
    <br>instead of giving our mineral resources and receiving the technology from them to develop our continent.
    <br>And that cannot help the African continent - rather corruption.
    <br>This world is not our home; we are just passing through.
    <br>In our passage from this wicked world to our permanent abode, I mean home,
    <br>we need God so that we do not dash our feet against a stone and stumble.
    <br>The Bible says we are in the world but we are not part of them.
    <br>Let me take you to the book of Acts of Apostles 7;
    <br>we will take it from verse 55.
    <br>"But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven
    <br>and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,
    <br>and said, 'Look! I see the heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!'.
    <br>Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears,
    <br>and ran at him with one accord."
    <br>This is about Stephen.
    <br>Stephen was stoned to death.
    <br>Rather than looking at the bodily pain
    <br>- all sorts of things were thrown at him -
    <br>the Bible says he simply said, "I see the heaven opened and the Son of Man was on the right hand."
    <br>He cried to God, saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
    <br>When you look at the book of Matthew 5 verse 8, "Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall see God".
    <br>The great thing that God looks at and requires is the heart.
    <br>We are made in our heart to be like Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: We are made in our heart to be like Jesus.
    <br>We will not be judged by the colour of our skin
    <br>but by the content of our character.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I will not be judged by the colour of my skin
    <br>but by the content of my character.
    <br>Your face could be oblong, round, tall, fat, smooth, short, big, whatever,
    <br>but in our heart we are made to be like Jesus.
    <br>I will not be judged by the colour of my skin but by the content of my character.
    <br>Let someone say: Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall see God.
    <br>1 Timothy 1:2, "To Timothy, a true son in the faith..." - that is a man of faith.
    <br>"... a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
    <br>This is a message for you and I.
    <br>A man of faith is led by an indwelling Spirit of grace,
    <br>which is greater than he who dwells in the world.
    <br>If you are a man of faith, what is happening around you cannot overwhelm you
    <br>but what God says about the situation.
    <br>A man of faith does things out of peace of mind -  not for money, not for popularity, not for fame.
    <br>What is the cause of your worry?
    <br>What is the cause of the hypertension?
    <br>Pressure and tension, anxiety - what is the cause?
    <br>A man of faith does what he loves, not what others around him are doing.
    <br>God does as He wills.
    <br>Finally, a man of faith will say, "Thank You, Jesus, for healing me" even when he is still in pain.
    <br>Remember, Jesus was thanking God when Lazarus was still in the grave.
    <br>The people were looking at Him and saying, "They say He should raise this man,
    <br>and He is thanking God. For what? For the man to be in the grave?"
    <br>A man of faith, when he is weak then he is strong,
    <br>because there is no real evil in his weakness.
    <br>The Master says I should tell the usher to come in this direction. OK.
    <br>"Usher, please come in this direction" - that is the instruction given to me.
    <br>I have done it perfectly.
    <br>As a man of faith, God will still have to mark it.
    <br>I should not just come to the conclusion that I have done it perfectly and be expecting excellence.
    <br>But others, "Usher, you are asked to come here. I am sorry."
    <br>Yes, I have done it perfectly.
    <br>If the result is the opposite, I will take it to the street.
    <br>I can become a '419', I will be a cheater, a robber, thief, steal, anything, because I feel cheated.
    <br>I will be discouraged.
    <br>After you have laboured, worked hard,
    <br>as a man of faith, God will still have to mark it.
    <br>If the result is good, give glory to God.
    <br>If it is the opposite, commit your way.
    <br>Because if the result is the opposite, in every situation God is still saying something.
    <br>That failure may be to stop me a while in order to preserve me.
    <br>That failure may be to stop me a while in order to prepare me for the challenges ahead.
    <br>That failure may be to stop me a while in order to strengthen my desire for Him.
    <br>That failure may be ...
    <br>Rise up and speak to your obstacle.
    <br>I'm walking with the Lord.
    <br>You obstacle, you cannot dictate my direction.
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>I'm walking with the Lord.
    <br>You obstacle, you cannot dictate my direction.
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>It may be to preserve me.
    <br>It may be to prepare me for the challenges ahead.
    <br>It may be to strengthen my desire.
    <br>It may be to keep me for a new level in life.
    <br>It may be!
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>A man of faith must know this.
    <br>Look at the persecution, name-calling, intimidation.
    <br>I suffered in the hands of my detractors. It caused me to be known all over the world.
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Tell me your situation.
    <br>If you go the way of the Cross, you begin to dance, you begin to smile at every insult.
    <br>Man of faith, your difficulty is not like others'.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Man of faith, your headache is not like others'.
    <br>Man of faith, your hardship is not like others'.
    <br>Man of faith, your sickness is not like others'.
    <br>Man of faith, rise up!
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>If anyone tells you that because you are a child of God you cannot be sick ...
    <br>Sickness can test you but it cannot destroy you.
    <br>If anybody tells you that as a pastor you cannot face crisis ...
    <br>Crisis can test you but it cannot destroy you.
    <br>We that walk by faith, we will have testing.
    <br>Our testing qualifies us for a promotion.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Man of faith, your hardship is not like others'.
    <br>Man of faith, your sickness is not like others'.
    <br>Yours may be to preserve you.
    <br>Yours may be to strengthen your desire.
    <br>Yours may be to prepare you for challenges.
    <br>Yours may be to keep you for a new level.
    <br>Yours may be ...
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>It is not unto death; not to destroy you.
    <br>God speaks strength through difficulty. Through difficulty, God speaks strength to our life.
    <br>You may be seated.

    <br>If God's Word is true for your life, let me see.
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>If you don't know what it is to be sick,
    <br>you will not be able to manage good health.
    <br>If you don't know what it is to be poor,
    <br>you will not be able to manage blessing when it comes.
    <br>Say: God is still saying something.
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We that walk by faith - what is seen, what our situation looks like, cannot dictate our direction.
    <br>No matter what comes, no matter what happens.
    <br>We that walk by faith - what is seen ...
    <br>Look at what happened to the servant of Elisha.
    <br>Very early he went to the backyard and he saw enemies, chariots everywhere.
    <br>He ran back to his master, "Master, they have surrounded us."
    <br>"Who?".
    <br>He said, "Soldiers. We are two here. What shall we do?".
    <br>The master said, "We walk by faith, not by sight."
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The master said to him, "We walk by faith, not by sight."
    <br>What is seen cannot dictate our direction.
    <br>What is seen cannot change my position.
    <br>What is seen ...

    <br>If you know the protection you are under ...
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon

    <br>those who are with you to fight for you ...
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Ask your neighbour once again: Do you know the protection you are under?
    <br>Those who are with you to fight for you, to protect you ...
    <br>Man of faith!
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>They stand a better chance in the natural because of their numbers.
    <br>They are everywhere.
    <br>Say: Free advert!
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>They may stand ...
    <br>Wait, listen. Are you a man of faith?
    <br>They may stand a better chance in the natural because of their numbers.
    <br>Free advert.
    <br>And the instruments at their disposal - instrument of propaganda, intimidation, name-calling.
    <br>But spiritually we are superior.
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You are superior because you are on the Lord's side.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I am superior because I am on the Lord's side.
    <br>You with God are majority!
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon

    <br>You are linked up with God.
    <br>Let me see your joy.
    <br>TROUBLES May TEST Me; They Cannot DESTROY Me!!! | TB Joshua Sermon

    <br>Thank you.
