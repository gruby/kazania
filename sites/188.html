  <p>    
    <br>This lady walks to The Synagogue Church of All Nations aided by her mother.
    <br>You can see from the looks on
    <br> her face that she is in excruciating pain.
    <br>Without the use of the lumbar corset around her waist,
    <br>carrying out daily activities will be very difficult.
    <br>IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, WATCH THIS... !!!
    <br>Having moved from one place to another without a solution to this problem,
    <br>she has come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations, believing that there is never a sickness
    <br>Jesus Christ cannot heal and never a disease He cannot cure.
    <br>These are medical reports from the hospital,
    <br>stating the level at which her discs have been damaged.
    <br>She has come with a problem of difficulty in walking due to prolapsed disc and lumbar sacralization.
    <br>The X-ray next to her further 
    <br>explains the severity of the problem.
    <br>She uses a lumbar corset to support herself.
    <br>She has had this problem for the past two years.
    <br>This is the lumbar corset which she uses to support herself
    <br>in order to hold her spine in place to prevent further damage.
    <br>IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, WATCH THIS... !!!
    <br>Welcome to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>Please tell us your name and where you're from.
    <br>My name is Tayo Akhamie. I'm from Nigeria.
    <br>What are you doing for a living, Ma?
    <br>I'm a legal practitioner, but I had to defer my PhD studies.
    <br>I was going for International Diplomacy and Human Relations for my PhD.
    <br>Madam, what is the problem that brought you here today?
    <br>The problem that brought me here today is difficulty in walking
    <br>due to prolapsed disc and lumbar sacralization of the spine.
    <br>As a result, I'm using a lumbar corset.
    <br>For how long have you been having this problem?
    <br>For two years.
    <br>How has this problem affected your life, Madam?
    <br>It has affected me a whole lot. I cannot walk without assistance,
    <br>I had to resign from my job. I get assistance in bathing and changing
    <br>and it has made my life miserable.
    <br>I cannot breathe very well. I usually faint because of the pain
    <br>and  the nerves are affected.
    <br>As a result, I had to stop my PhD because I cannot read, understand and focus.
    <br>OK, Madam. So where have you been in search of solution for this problem?
    <br>I've been in Scotland, Germany, England and in California - no solution.
    <br>OK. We can see an X-ray next to you. 
    <br>Could you please explain the X-ray.
    <br>What is it all about?
    <br>This X-ray is all about my spine,
    <br>One concentrates on the lumbar spine which is turned around.
    <br>It is somewhere here.
    <br>And that is why it is called the 'sacralization'.
    <br>'Sacralization' means fully turned around and it no longer becomes the disc it was.
    <br>You can't identify this.
    <br>The other X-ray is the one that passes through my chest and up.
    <br>I also have a prolapsed disc on this one.
    <br>It has affected my body and I also have trapped nerves in between my discs.
    <br>As a result of that, it has affected all my organs.
    <br>My organs are very challenged and out of 100%, my organs are functioning at 41%.
    <br>My muscle tone and balance is also very challenged and is functioning at 44% out of 100%.
    <br>As a result, if you pinch me with a needle or insert something through my skin,
    <br>I rarely feel the pain.
    <br>We can see a lumbar corset. Could you please tell us more about it, Madam.
    <br>The lumbar corset is used to support my lumbar spine so that it can be in alignment
    <br>because I also have misalignment of the spine
    <br>because the muscles around my spine are degenerating very fast.
    <br>When I stand, my muscle cannot 
    <br>hold the spine in place and then it shifts
    <br>and causes the nerves to be trapped in-between my spine.
    <br>You mean, without this lumbar corset, you cannot walk?
    <br>No, without this lumbar corset, I cannot walk or sit.
    <br>Out of the 24 vertebrates, I have only six functioning a little bit.
    <br>As you can see on this diagram,
    <br> this was gotten from a recent machine.
    <br>It got this from a recent machine that was brought from NASA.
    <br>This machine is only being used for astronauts before they go to space
    <br>and when they come back.
    <br>This diagram depicts the nerves that are being affected.
    <br>My muscles and tone balance are very challenged.
    <br>I can barely stand or walk straight.
    <br>I barely have the strength to carry myself because my muscles are extremely weak.
    <br>I have done operations, I have done facet injections injected in my spine but all to no avail.
    <br>That was why I came here.
    <br>I believe that I will get healed of all my pains and infirmities, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. We believe with you that Jesus Christ will heal you
    <br>for the salvation of your soul, in Jesus name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua ministering prayers to the people
    <br>who have come to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations prayer line.
    <br>As he does, healing, deliverance 
    <br>and all of God's blessings are released on them,
    <br>uprooting whatever that is not of God in their lives.
    <br>Man of God, help me!
    <br>Man of God, help my daughter! Please help me!
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me!
    <br>I have lumbar sacralization of the spine.
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>As a result of this, I have trapped discs in-between my spine
    <br>I suffer from insomnia, I have to take  drugs to sleep.
    <br>Man of God, please help me!
    <br>I have gastritis. Man of God, please help me.
    <br>I have pneumonia as a result of this. Man of God, please help me.
    <br>Please, I can't walk. Man of God, help me.
    <br>I've been to everywhere to no avail. 
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>I'm dying gradually. Please help me.
    <br>Man of God, please help my daughter.
    <br>She cannot sleep well, she cannot sit for the past two years.
    <br>Severally, she tried to kill herself.
    <br>Please help me, Man of God. I can't do anything on my own.
    <br>My organs are gradually dying. Out of 100%, my organs are only functioning 41%.
    <br>My muscle and tone balance is very low; it is life threatening.
    <br>Out of 100%, only 44% are functioning.
    <br>I can't do anything on my own, I can't reason well.
    <br>I'm a lawyer but I can't work; I can't practice; I can't represent people in court.
    <br>I deferred my PhD because of this; please, help me!
    <br>Please, I have difficulty walking.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me.
    <br>I have lumbar sacralization of the spine.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing my daughter! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I can walk!
    <br>I'm healed! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I'm healed! I can walk! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am free! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My daughter is healed!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>After her healing from difficulty in walking due to a prolapsed disc and lumbar sacralization,
    <br>Miss Tayo Akhamie came back to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>the next service day to share her wonderful testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>On the left, you can see how she came to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>in excruciating pain and barely 
    <br>able to walk unassisted by her mother.
    <br>But today, Miss Tayo is a different 
    <br>person.
    <br>With a vibrant smile, she can now freely move around pain-free.
    <br>Let's listen to her.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Children of God, shout 'Emmanuel'!
    <br>My name is Akhamie Tayo.
    <br>I am a legal practitioner and I was about to start my PhD before I had this problem
    <br>which brought me to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>It all started two years back in Aberdeen, Scotland.
    <br>I travelled on an extensive trip and when I got back, I had a slight headache.
    <br>I prayed and went to bed.
    <br>I got up with excruciating pain and 
    <br>went to shower.
    <br>Walking to the bathroom. I took three to four steps; then, I stopped.
    <br>I got stuck and didn't know what I was doing.
    <br>I couldn't move my legs or my arms; I was sweating profusely and shaking.
    <br>I could not communicate with my mouth, only with my eyes.
    <br>I was lucky that my friend was around to help me.
    <br>She said,  "Toya, if you cannot communicate, blink your eyes for me.
    <br>When I ask you about the problem, if it is 'yes', blink once and 'no' blink twice".
    <br>That was how I could communicate before the ambulance came.
    <br>Thereafter, I was in the hospital, and it grew worse.
    <br>They tried all sorts of tests and the case was getting worse.
    <br>For over a month, I was placed on constant acupuncture,
    <br>every morning and evening but it didn't  work.
    <br>Besides that, I always had steroids injected into my spine.
    <br>As time went on, I was told that surgery would be my only way out
    <br>but professional advice was that I was too young to have that surgery performed.
    <br>As a result of that, I had a misalignment of the spine from my axis to my coccyx,
    <br>which is the spine underneath my skull down to my tailbone.
    <br>This misalignment caused the nerves to be pressed in-between my spine.
    <br>As a result, all my organs in my body were affected.
    <br>Out of 100%, my muscle and tone balance only worked 44%.
    <br>Out of 100%, my hormones and organs only worked 41%.
    <br>In the vertebra, you will find 24 nerves.
    <br>Out of 24, I only had 6 functioning.
    <br>The nerve that passes through the axis
    <br>which is the one that holds the neck and the skull was severely damaged.
    <br>As a result, you could see the damage throughout -
    <br>from my skin, nails and hair loss, to all the essential organs in my body.
    <br>I was dying slowly.
    <br>I realized that there was no cure for this and the pain kept occurring.
    <br>I was too sore to go for physiotherapy and I could not really do anything.
    <br>I travelled from one place to another but at the end of the day,
    <br>I found out that the only solution was God - Jesus Christ.
    <br>That was why I came here.
    <br>When I came, I was fixed on the prayer line and the anointed man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, stretched his hand forward and prayed for me.
    <br>Instantly, I fell to the ground.
    <br>I didn't know where I was and for a moment, I was oblivious
    <br>of what was happening around me physically.
    <br>The only thing I could hear where little voices but I could not see anybody.
    <br>I didn't know where I was.
    <br>In my mind I started fighting. I thought I was hallucinating.
    <br>I was thinking, "What is happening? Am I alone in the church?"
    <br>I couldn't see or hear anything,
    <br>Then, I heard a voice inside saying, "Get up! You are healed!
    <br>You are healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens you".
    <br>I got up. Instantaneously, I had no pain and I found myself walking.
    <br>Day by day, I've been getting stronger and stronger and stronger.
    <br>Now I'm free! This is my first time standing.
    <br>Before I couldn't sit down for one minute; I couldn't sit straight.
    <br>Now, I can sit for hours, I can stand, turn and twirl.
    <br>You can see God is wonderful.
    <br>I can squat. God is wonderful; praise God!
    <br>My name is John Akhamie.
    <br>I'm the father of Tayo - my last born.
    <br>She was preparing for her PhD program
    <br>when I received a telephone call from Scotland, precisely Aberdeen,
    <br>that my daughter was sick, bedridden, had been admitted
    <br>and that it was a very serious case.
    <br>She had a problem with her spine and needed urgent surgery
    <br>but they were afraid because of her age.
    <br>There was just a 50/50 chance of her surviving that type of surgery.
    <br>That it could lead to a total collapse of the nervous system or sudden death.
    <br>Because of that, they decided to use alternative methods -
    <br>giving her pain-relieving tablets and steroid injections but there was no response.
    <br>From there, she went to other parts of Europe.
    <br>In London, she was also admitted but there was no solution.
    <br>From there, we flew her to the United States, California, for the same problem
    <br>but there was no solution.
    <br>The doctors emphatically said that there was no solution
    <br>other than the surgery they did not advise.
    <br>That we should be patient and watch.
    <br>It was then that I asked my mother for the way out.
    <br>She said that she believed the way out was to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I said that she was in the US and asked how she could take a flight to Nigeria.
    <br>She was merely given a lumbar corset to support her spine.
    <br>My wife sent the Anointing Water to one of my daughters in Los Angeles.
    <br>She ministered the Anointing Water on her and she regained some strength.
    <br>Then, she came back to Nigeria.
    <br>My reaction when I could not recognize my daughter was that I wept.
    <br>By that time, deformity had set in; she developed a hunchback
    <br>and the bottom of her backbone was curved.
    <br>In fact, she was very skinny and looking sickly.
    <br>She could not support herself.
    <br>She would lie down and couldn't get up unless we sat her up.
    <br>That was the situation.
    <br>My wife decided to bring her to The SCOAN.
    <br>When they eventually came back in the night, I heard noise downstairs.
    <br>My daughter was shouting and calling my name, "Daddy, I am healed!"
    <br>She ran upstairs and was jumping.
    <br>She was jumping up and down; she took my hands and was taking me round.
    <br>I said, "Is this my daughter?" I could not believe it.
    <br>She opened her apparel and I could see that the hunchback had disappeared.
    <br>Her backbone had straightened as she used to be in those days.
    <br>I give glory to God. To me, this is the biggest miracle in my life.
    <br>While she was undergoing this pain, I was also feeling the pain.
    <br>I would go to my bedroom and quietly shed tears.
    <br>Occasionally, she would call me and say, "Daddy, I know you have tried for me,
    <br>and mummy has also tried. I want to go".
    <br>I would say, "Where are you going to? Don't say that again".
    <br>"I want to go." - she kept repeating that.
    <br>Now, she is very strong and since that day, she is getting stronger and stronger.
    <br>I also noticed that all the rashes on her skin,
    <br>and the veins that were coming out disappeared.
    <br>She now has a good skin.
    <br>This shows that every part of her body has been healed.
    <br>I give glory to God.
    <br>Since that day, every morning my daughter wakes me up
    <br>and leads me on a jog around the compound.
    <br>She dances and can twirl around 360 degrees; this she could not do before.
    <br>She can jump up and is very healthy as if she was never sick before.
    <br>There is another aspect to it.
    <br>When she was coming back from the U.S., the doctors were told
    <br>that she was bringing the X-rays as a requirement to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>They said that the sickness could not be cured and that we were just wasting our time.
    <br>They said that if she received her healing, they would be interested.
    <br>IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, WATCH THIS... !!!
    <br>I thank God Almighty for His grace in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This singular incident is a milestone in my life.
    <br>It is an incident I will never forget in my life.
    <br>It has increased my faith in the Lord.
    <br>For the whole world to know, Prophet T.B. Joshua has super grace in his life.
    <br>It is just unexplainable; it is a mystery.
    <br>My daughter went around the whole world to the best hospitals.
    <br>It was a sickness they said could not be cured and that it was impossible.
    <br>She came to The SCOAN and in a split second, she was healed.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's now go back to what actually happened to the little girl and the father.
    <br>What happened to you when I drew you down suddenly?
    <br>You were here for healing, for prayer
    <br>and you expected me to lay hand
    <br>and begin to say, "I rebuke, in Jesus' name!",
    <br>"I heal you, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>"I bind that sickness, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>So that you too would be saying, "Amen!"
    <br>But instead of that, I went towards you and dragged you on the floor.
    <br>What came upon you when I dragged you as if I was fighting you?
    <br>Okay. The first impression was that I heard you shout and say, "Get up!"
    <br>I was thinking, "I can't get up, of course".
    <br>I was wondering if I was shameful or bad that he forced me to get up.
    <br>I thought, "He is very angry; I must be a terrible sinner".
    <br>That was what that spirit that caused that terrible pain deserved!
    <br>I was not fighting her; I was fighting that spirit that caused her pain.
    <br>I was not trying to be hard on her but on the spirit that caused her pain.
    <br>I was very aggressive towards that spirit because I was not happy.
    <br>How can a young lady trying to get her PhD be arrested, be caged with this stupid pain?
    <br>I was looking at this spirit and wondering, "What is wrong with you, you evil spirit?
    <br>Why should you do that?"
    <br>I was fighting that spirit.
    <br>IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES, WATCH THIS... !!!
    <br>So it was unnecessary to now give my attention to that evil spirit.
    <br>I did not want to give attention to the spirit; rather I wanted to embarrass this spirit.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>God heals, we treat.
    <br>We all - medical doctors, physicians, whatever - treat while God heals.
    <br>That's true, sir.
    <br>Thank you. What can you say to the world with your age?
    <br>Before I give my advice, please I would like to shed some light on the items on the board.
    <br>This is one of the last tests I went for.
    <br>This machine is one of its kind; it just came out and it is from NASA.
    <br>They use this machine for astronauts before they go into space
    <br>and when they come back.
    <br>It is to detect the cause of the problem even before it starts to manifest.
    <br>I brought this because it is easily explainable.
    <br>This is how the spine is.
    <br>You have from the atlas to the coccyx which is the tail of the spine.
    <br>The atlas holds the skull on the neck.
    <br>This is all the way down to the coccyx in your pelvic.
    <br>This diagram explains this.
    <br>If you take a closer look at this vertebra, you will see some of the vertebra underlined.
    <br>These were all the vertebra I had problems with.
    <br>All these nerves passing through this vertebra, I had problems with.
    <br>Out of 24, I only had 6 functioning.
    <br>If you take a look at 1C, you will see the areas controlled by the nerves
    <br>and you can see what the problem was: blood supply to the head, pituitary gland,
    <br>scalp, bones of the face, brain, inner and middle ear, sympathetic nervous system.
    <br>And these would be the possible effects of the malfunction:
    <br>headache, neurosis, insomnia, head colds, high blood pressure,
    <br>migraine headaches and so on and so forth.
    <br>If you take a good look down, you will see that
    <br>I had a problem in almost all the vertebra and I had a complex problem.
    <br>Now, if you come here, this is the EMC machine. I don't know what it is really called.
    <br>It's so advanced. This machine detects the nerves that have a problem.
    <br>If you come down here, you will see that this is the overall graph.
    <br>Here is danger, which is my axis and now if you come here, you will see C1, C1, C3, C3.
    <br>You see that it is black. If you come here, you will see that this is C3.
    <br>And this is what - cheeks, outer ear, 
    <br>face bones, teeth, trifacial nerve.
    <br>The black means it is damaged - beyond repair -
    <br>and that shows how bad my body was.
    <br>If you could see my spine, it was almost like a Christmas tree
    <br>because you could see numerous colors.
    <br>The normal spine is supposed to be like this - just plain and healthy.
    <br>But I had colors everywhere - measuring the temperature of the pain
    <br>and the extent of the damage in my body.
    <br>To be honest, when I had the tests done,
    <br>there were other Asian doctors coming to the room to look at me.
    <br>Why? Because they had a slight argument
    <br>when they saw the various reports that came from one person.
    <br>They argued and said, "No, it's not possible that one person can have all this!
    <br>I'm sure you must be mistaken. Maybe, you made a mistake somewhere.
    <br>It can't be from one person".
    <br>The doctor then replied that it was from one person.
    <br>Funny enough, when they came to look at me, they said, "Hi" and I responded.
    <br>They actually came to see if I was assisted by a form of stretcher or something.
    <br>They couldn't believe that I could reason well.
    <br>But after the man of God prayed for me, you see that all these disappeared.
    <br>I can turn, squat, twirl, I am so happy. I can jump and do much more.
    <br>I'm so happy! Praise God!
    <br>Hallelujah. You have listened to our sister.
    <br>Look at the old picture and the present picture. She looked old in the former picture.
    <br>No one could believe that she is a young girl.
    <br>At that former picture, she looked very, very old.
    <br>But now, she looks very young and just one week healing.
    <br>By the next two months, I think she will be a 15 years-old baby.
    <br>Hallelujah. This is to tell you that when you are healed,
    <br>you are healed in your fluids, in your blood and in your muscles.
    <br>The cause of that sickness is in the blood.
    <br>So not only just making you walk but right to the root of that problem.
    <br>That is the fluid, the blood because that sickness is in the blood.
    <br>That is causing the face to deform.
    <br>So the Spirit of God has to go there straight and get it uprooted from the blood.
    <br>Not just to make her walk. If it is just to make her walk, it would be temporary healing.
    <br>Later, the thing will still fall down because it's in the blood.
    <br>So that is the healing of God. When you are healed, you are healed perpetually.
    <br>And indeed, you are healed.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>What a radical transformation within less than a week.
    <br>On the left, we can see how deformed her waist was due to the spinal problem
    <br>and having to wear a very tight lumbar corset.
    <br>Her face was also very pale and full of pimples.
    <br>But instantly after her healing, her skin color returned to normal,
    <br>leaving her with a now glowing skin,
    <br>proving the complete internal healing she received in Jesus' name.
    <br>Not only was her spinal cord restored, but her blood and every organ of our body
    <br>has been renewed by the Master Healer, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Glory be to God.
