    <br>When you are healed by Christ's Word, you should be ruled by His Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When I am healed by Christ's Word, I should be ruled by His Word.
    <br>A long queue of people from far and wide, old and young, famous and laymen
    <br>have come to The SCOAN to receive what money cannot buy.
    <br>Here you can see the lightning power of God flowing through T.B. Joshua
    <br>to set the people free from their various afflictions, troubles and difficulties.
    <br>A delivering touch from heaven restoring one's life.
    <br>This is Pastor Linda Prinsloo, who from birth has suffered from polycystic kidneys.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>She falls under the anointing, as soon as T.B. Joshua stretches out his hand towards her in faith.
    <br>At the name of Jesus Christ, all sickness, disease, failure, setback, disappointment has to bow.
    <br>Now you are healed by Christ's Word, you should be ruled by His Word.
    <br>Begin to confess - Jesus is my Healer!
    <br>I am healed - Jesus is my Healer!
    <br>I am redeemed - Jesus is my Redeemer!
    <br>A few months later, the Emmanuel TV Team went on a mission to the Prinsloo house
    <br>in Rustenburg, South Africa
    <br>This is Rustenburg, a quiet little town, about two hours drive from the capital city of Johannesburg.
    <br>This is the Emmanuel TV Team making their way through the streets of Rustenburg,
    <br>on route to the Prinsloo house, the home of Pastor Linda Prinsloo,
    <br>who has recently attended the prayer line with the problem of polycystic kidneys.
    <br>Let's hear from Pastor Linda.
    <br>My name is Pastor Linda Prinsloo and I stay in Rustenburg, South Africa.
    <br>I firstly want to say praise God that He has really touched my life
    <br>through Prophet T.B. Joshua and The SCOAN, when I visited there.
    <br>My life started, as a baby I had polycystic kidneys
    <br>which was hereditary and I had it all my life.
    <br>Seven years ago I got very sick and I went in and out of the hospital
    <br>and to the doctors and they had lots of tests done.
    <br>I then found out that it was my kidneys.
    <br>It was in such a bad state that they suggested that I should go on dialysis.
    <br>At that time I was desperately sick, not knowing what to do.
    <br>I was in such a state that my whole household and life came to a stand still.
    <br>After being in the hospital, being treated and they couldn't really do anything for you.
    <br>They said it's just one of those things that can never be reversed.
    <br>There is no hope when you have this kind of disease.
    <br>My life was so impacted.
    <br>At night-time I couldn't sleep; in the mornings I would get up so exhausted.
    <br>Pain is my kidneys; in such a bad state that I couldn't live a normal life.
    <br>I had this wonderful feeling of God being in The SCOAN when I visited there.
    <br>Then in my heart of hearts I knew that God would do a miracle in my life
    <br>and save me for my family.
    <br>When I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua, I really saw the love of God in his eyes
    <br>and he ministered to us a tremendous word of encouragement and wisdom.
    <br>It really just touched my life and I knew that this is a place where God abides.
    <br>I thank God for a place where we can come and experience His presence in such a way.
    <br>I knew that God had an appointment with me there.
    <br>Sitting in the prayer line that Sunday was so exciting, it was so vibrant that
    <br>actually there was this feeling of being expectant and reverent for God.
    <br>It was wonderful.
    <br>When the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me,
    <br>I knew that God just touched me in faith.
    <br>God healed my body and I thank God.
    <br>From that moment, from the time I came out of the prayer line,
    <br>I could feel there was a difference in my body.
    <br>I had no pain and there were no swellings.
    <br>Before I had lots of swellings in my body: in my feet, my hands and my face.
    <br>First thing I shared with my husband after I came home -
    <br>I was so excited about my healing, getting of the plane, not being swollen, I had no pain...
    <br>But my spiritual life was so touched.
    <br>She said that since birth she had had the problem of cystic kidneys.
    <br>The only answer the doctors could provide was to depend on dialysis treatment
    <br>for the rest of her life.
    <br>Let's hear from her husband.
    <br>It was such a wonderful privilege that noting can say that this is not a miracle.
    <br>I believed that this miracle would happen to Linda.
    <br>Pastor Linda and her family enjoy a stroll together.
    <br>Something that was too tiresome and painful to do before.
    <br>In order to buttress her testimony further,
    <br>Pastor Linda and her family enter their car, pull out of their drive way.
    <br>They leave for their local surgery, to meet with their family doctor.
    <br>Arriving at the clinic they haven't visited for some time,
    <br>the Prinsloo family head towards the building they used to visit frequently
    <br>for check-ups and treatment of a serious kind.
    <br>Today, they are here for a completely different reason;
    <br>for God's name to be glorified.
    <br>The Prinsloo family and the Emmanuel TV Team have come to meet with those
    <br>who once knew Pastor Linda as a sick person,
    <br>who now know her as a healthy person.
    <br>We are here at the surgery, the family doctors,
    <br>who is very aware of the whole case from beginning to the end.
    <br>So we want to meet with her right now.
    <br>Hello, I am Dr Marleen Van Dyk and I have been the family physician since 2003.
    <br>I met Pastor Linda Prinsloo in 2003 with diagnosed polycystic kidneys.
    <br>She had a CT scan from one of the nephrologists in Johannesburg.
    <br>The condition at that stage was quite chronic
    <br>and she suffered with continuous infections, back pain and so on.
    <br>It was quite difficult for her to cope with normal living and so on.
    <br>We had to admit her into hospital a few times.
    <br>Earlier this year, she told me that she wanted to go to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I was very positive about that because I knew that God is our Healer
    <br>and God did miraculously heal her.
    <br>On her returning to South Africa, what happened when you saw her next?
    <br>She came to me in the surgery and she decided to do 'a sona'.
    <br>One of the expert sona women was here in Rustenburg
    <br>and she eventually did the sona and there was no sign of any of the cysts in the kidneys.
    <br>Praise God for that!
    <br>This was definitely a miracle done by God.
    <br>No medicine could have done this.
    <br>Glory be to God. Amen!
    <br>Jesus is the great Redeemer of our sorrow, who brings light to man's life.
    <br>After returning from The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria,
    <br>a sona expert tested Pastor's Linda kidneys.
    <br>In doing so she concluded that any sign of cysts in her kidneys had gone.
    <br>They stride triumphantly out of the hospital.
    <br>Those who resolve to make God their Source, shall find Him all sufficient,
    <br>and their happiness remains permanent.
