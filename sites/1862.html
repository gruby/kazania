  <p>    
    <br>We are about to watch a documentary of Dr Gerrie De Haas, a medical practitioner from South Africa,
    <br>who came to The SCOAN with the problem of deafness.
    <br>After an encounter with Jesus Christ, he was healed through the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Thirteen years later, the Emmanuel TV Team went to visit Dr Gerrie de Haas
    <br>to interview him regarding his walk with the Lord since his miraculous healing
    <br>because he knew that his healing was not an end in itself
    <br>but a means to an end, which is the salvation of his soul.
    <br>Let's watch what happened.
    <br>The day has just broken and the Emmanuel TV Team is on a journey to a town in Limpopo, South Africa.
    <br>The prospect of listening to the amazing testimony
    <br>of somebody who came to The SCOAN thirteen years ago in a distressing and pitiful situation
    <br>fills the air with excitement and makes the long journey short.
    <br>Finally, the Emmanuel TV Team arrives at their destination, a town called Polokwane.
    <br>They park in front of a medical health centre to meet Dr Gerrie De Haas at his working place.
    <br>Getting out of the car, the Emmanuel TV Team member walks to the entrance of the medical health centre
    <br>to meet Dr Gerrie De Haas, who welcomes him with open arms,
    <br>remembering the day when Jesus Christ restored him back to the original position
    <br>in which God had created him.
    <br>When God's people communicate their experiences, let them always remember
    <br>to take note of what God has done to keep them humble,
    <br>as well as what God had done in favour to them and for their advancement.
    <br>Dr Gerrie De Haas' name and qualification as a medical practitioner are displayed on the wall
    <br>at the entrance of the medical health centre.
    <br>Following Dr Gerrie to his consultation room, the magnitude of his testimony
    <br>is fully grasped, bearing in mind that Dr Gerrie would not have been able to practice
    <br>as a medical doctor, if God did not intervene in his affairs.
    <br>Sliding behind his desk, Dr Gerrie De Haas is ready to share his testimony with us.
    <br>Emmanuel, viewers. This is Eugene reporting for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We are here in Polokwane, Limpopo Province, South Africa.
    <br>We are doing a follow-up testimony with one of the thousands of people
    <br>that have come to The SCOAN and received a touch from our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>So, we want to find out more about what role faith has played in their lives,
    <br>how important maintenance is and how that transformative power,
    <br>the touch from our Lord Jesus Christ that healed them,
    <br>has transformed their lives and even the lives of those around them.
    <br>Join us as we listen to this faith-building testimony.
    <br>Remain blessed and let your faith be encouraged.
    <br>Let's hear what Dr Gerrie has to say.
    <br>Dr Gerrie, thank you so much for your time and for speaking to us today.
    <br>Please introduce yourself to our viewers.
    <br>Thank you so much, Eugene.
    <br>My name is Gerrie de Haas.
    <br>I have been a medical practitioner here in Polokwane for the past 40 years.
    <br>It is indeed my privilege to have the Emmanuel TV crew with me today
    <br>as a follow-up to what happened to me in Lagos, Nigeria 13 years ago.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>To start off with, let us watch the video clip of how you actually received
    <br>your touch from Jesus Christ and healing all those years ago
    <br>through Prophet T.B. Joshua at The SCOAN.
    <br>EXTRAORDINARY: MEDICAL DOCTOR Healed Of DEAFNESS!!!
    <br>My name is Gerrie de Haas.
    <br>I am a medical practitioner for 27 years.
    <br>Can you tell us what is your problem?
    <br>I have a loss of hearing in both of my ears
    <br>due to a measles infection that I had when I was a child.
    <br>You've got a little instrument in your hand.
    <br>What is the purpose of that?
    <br>The little instrument controls the hearing, sound and volume of my hearing aids
    <br>that I have in my ears.
    <br>I find it very difficult in the practice that it's not always easy to put my stethoscope in my ears
    <br>and I don't get all the sounds coming my way.
    <br>Where did you hear about The Synagogue Church?
    <br>In medical terms, everybody in the world knows The Synagogue Church.
    <br>As a doctor, how is it affecting your practice and your normal, daily life?
    <br>It affects my normal daily life in the sense that to wear hearing aids all the time is not easy.
    <br>There is also the problem that I, as a medical practitioner, am supposed to heal people
    <br>but I also have a disease - a crippling disease.
    <br>My family - a great pleasure and joy - they know that if I take my hearing aids out,
    <br>they cannot communicate and it's not easy for them.
    <br>So apart from you, it will be a very big miracle to your family?
    <br>It would be a tremendous, wonderful miracle.
    <br>Doctor, we want you to just take out your hearing aids to your hands, and we will focus on them.
    <br>These are the hearing aids.
    <br>How do you use these hearing aids?
    <br>Can you understand what I'm asking you?
    <br>I didn't hear what you asked just now.
    <br>When the hearing aids are out, he cannot hear what I am asking him.
    <br>Dr Gerrie De Haas has been deaf for years.
    <br>With him is the hearing device he uses to communicate at home and work.
    <br>You can imagine what it must be like to be deaf as a medical doctor.
    <br>Let's see how God will heal him.
    <br>Here is the emergency section of The SCOAN, Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Here you can see people from across the globe, who have come with diverse afflictions.
    <br>Among them is Dr Gerrie de Haas waiting to receive God's healing.
    <br>Remember, Jesus Christ is the Miracle Provider.
    <br>There is never a sickness He cannot heal, never a problem He cannot solve.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is a Spirit of healing and He brings healing into you.
    <br>Never a Healer like Jesus Christ.
    <br>If God gave you and I the most priceless possession He had,
    <br>why would He withhold from us anything of less value?
    <br>Let's see how God will set the doctor free today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Here we can see the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua praying in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>stretching forth his hand in accordance with the Book of Acts 4:30,
    <br>performing signs and wonders, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Be healed, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>No one is hopeless whose hope is in Christ Jesus.
    <br>The man of God is still praying for the medical doctor.
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has commanded the doctor to remove the hearing aids.
    <br>Man's solution is no solution but God's power is beyond thought.
    <br>All power in heaven and on earth has been invested in the name 'Jesus Christ'.
    <br>With the name of Jesus, the man of God has commanded him to get up.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is talking with the medical doctor and he is responding,
    <br>proving that he can hear.
    <br>Seeing this video of how Jesus Christ radically transformed your life all those years ago,
    <br>what kind of memories does it bring to your mind?
    <br>Obviously this...
    <br>I think my life changed dramatically since I went to Lagos 13 years ago.
    <br>I was at that time losing life because I was not hearing life.
    <br>I was cut off from people because of not hearing what they were saying to me.
    <br>It had such a big effect on my medical practice in those days.
    <br>I couldn't hear people.
    <br>I was so desperate when I went to Lagos.
    <br>I was really desperate for a touch from God
    <br>because medicine could not offer that to me.
    <br>God restored my hearing in Lagos
    <br>through the work of Prophet T.B. Joshua, 13 years ago.
    <br>God also healed my spirit when I was there.
    <br>I came back as a changed person
    <br>and ever since, it has had such a great effect on my life.
    <br>I will never stop talking and telling people
    <br>about what really happened to me in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>You said you were desperate for a touch of God,
    <br>how terrible was this problem of deafness
    <br>that actually led you to go and meet Prophet T.B. Joshua in The SCOAN?
    <br>Firstly, it had a great effect on my family life.
    <br>I started using a hearing aid.
    <br>I had used it for 12-13 years at that time.
    <br>I couldn't really watch TV.
    <br>I never went out with people because I couldn't hear what they said.
    <br>I know how much effect it had on my family.
    <br>Daddy was deaf and they couldn't talk to me.
    <br>I had the 'sentence', in a certain sense, from the medical people
    <br>that there was nothing they could do.
    <br>The nerves were damaged permanently and my hearing just disappeared.
    <br>I couldn't go back to the theatre and operate on people
    <br>because people wore masks there and I couldn't see their mouths
    <br>so, I couldn't hear what they were saying.
    <br>I left the whole issue of doing confinements.
    <br>I did thousands upon thousands but at a stage, I had to stop
    <br>because I couldn't hear the heartbeats of the babies anymore.
    <br>I left all the theatre work and anaesthetic work
    <br>because I couldn't hear the hearts of people.
    <br>As a medical person I knew exactly what this was all about.
    <br>The prognosis was so bad.
    <br>In those days...
    <br>Faith is a difficult thing to understand.
    <br>I thought I had faith.
    <br>At the end, I went to Lagos and I saw miraculous healings.
    <br>I remember the night before we had our prayer line so well.
    <br>A girl came there that had been unconscious for long period of time.
    <br>The prophet prayed for her and she got healed.
    <br>Something happened in my spirit that night.
    <br>I said, "God, if You can heal this girl, surely You can heal me as well."
    <br>Faith came into my life, seeing and experiencing the greatness of God.
    <br>When we go into those prayer lines, there is always a doubt.
    <br>We are always sceptical.
    <br>We know that God can heal but we have this whole thing on the inside,
    <br>"Is God really going to heal me as well?"
    <br>Sickness, terminal sickness and chronic diseases
    <br>always have such a big emotional effect on people as well.
    <br>I wasn't only physically healed.
    <br>God healed my emotions and my spirit.
    <br>I came back, after being a Christian for many years,
    <br>a new creature for the first time in my life.
    <br>We thank God Almighty.
    <br>Faith is indeed the transformative power of the universe.
    <br>That faith that you said you received there by seeing what God Almighty
    <br>has done in the lives of other people encouraged your faith.
    <br>If millions of this generation are to believe Jesus Christ,
    <br>they have to see the evidence that He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>That was what you saw and you experienced it first hand.
    <br>Where did you go in search of a solution before going to Jesus?
    <br>I went to all the prominent ear, nose and throat specialists of that day.
    <br>I went for all the scans to see whether there were no tumours
    <br>on the inside of my skull that could cause this and then, I came back to the conclusion
    <br>that this was an effect of a viral infection I had as a child.
    <br>Progressively, I started losing my hearing.
    <br>When people are in a time like this and are told,
    <br>"There is nothing we can do anymore.
    <br>Take the hearing aid, go home and see how you will manage life."
    <br>I had said it to so many people.
    <br>Those things are not lightly said.
    <br>It is not always easy to see.
    <br>You would see people having an emotional breakdown when you say things like this.
    <br>Apart from everything that medical science can do,
    <br>as medical doctors, we are still limited to certain things.
    <br>There are so many diseases that we can still not cure today, medically.
    <br>This is the big message to the world.
    <br>If you know the Healer, His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>There is not a sickness He cannot cure.
    <br>There is not a problem He cannot change.
    <br>I would always tell many people to turn to God earlier in their lives.
    <br>Don't spend everything on medical doctors up to the point when you die.
    <br>Turn your life and see Him as the Great Healer.
    <br>As a medical doctor, when people are cynical and sceptical about the healing power of God,
    <br>you as a living witness to the healing power of God,
    <br>what is your message to such people?
    <br>It is a natural thing for people to be sceptical about this.
    <br>They just believe that God can heal
    <br>but they are so sceptical whether God will heal them.
    <br>We find that people don't always see Christ as the Healer.
    <br>They would always be sceptical.
    <br>We know that from the history of the Church - even when people get healed.
    <br>It happened to me as well; they would say that you were hypnotised
    <br>or maybe, you were never sick.
    <br>They would always have something to discredit the work of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>I think it will always be like that.
    <br>People don't manage to put their faith in what God has done.
    <br>God is the Deliverer but people don't go for deliverance.
    <br>God is the Healer but they don't turn to Him for healing.
    <br>I think it is just going to be like that.
    <br>I personally think that it is a time to - and I have been doing that greatly -
    <br>tell people, "Just look at me.
    <br>Christ can heal your problem.
    <br>It is not the end of the road but the beginning of a new life."
    <br>Dr Gerrie, you rightly said that there is never a Healer like our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>As a medical doctor, how do you explain your healing
    <br>to those who have a scientific frame of mind?
    <br>It is do difficult to convince them, even if you have medical proof.
    <br>We have seen so many people who had cancer and they have come back.
    <br>X-rays and sonar examinations show that at the end, there is no more cancer.
    <br>There is no longer any tumour there.
    <br>They would always find some type of excuse not to believe it.
    <br>They had medical TV programmes on our television channels.
    <br>People want to testify of the healing that happened physically in their bodies
    <br>and they would always have another person coming up to say they don't believe it.
    <br>It will always be like that.
    <br>I am so grateful for the grace of God that 13 years ago, He made me go there.
    <br>He gave me a new opportunity to change my life.
    <br>It is going to be like that.
    <br>The evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Your life was drastically changed.
    <br>How did this affect people around you, people in the practice with you and your family,
    <br>how did they experience this drastic change in your life?
    <br>My practice, when I came back and my hearing was restored,
    <br>they were the first ones to come back and say that they could see,
    <br>as medical people, that there was a change.
    <br>All the big stethoscopes and old things were gone
    <br>and life was coming back to normal again.
    <br>There was a specialist that I had.
    <br>When I went back to him and they did all the hearing tests again, they were amazed.
    <br>I went around, talking to many churches in Polokwane in those days
    <br>because everybody wanted to hear this testimony.
    <br>Just being a medical doctor, it counted a little bit more.
    <br>Many of the people knew me before;
    <br>they knew about my hearing aids and problems.
    <br>I think it had a great impact locally on the whole medical community.
    <br>Not only that but the whole town as well.
    <br>Yes indeed, we overcome by the Blood of the Lamb and the words of our testimony.
    <br>The more you testify of what God Almighty has done for you,
    <br>the more He will do it again and again.
    <br>We thank God for giving you the grace to share your testimony
    <br>with so many people for their lives also to be touched.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that a lasting solution
    <br>comes from a lasting relationship with Jesus Christ.
    <br>After receiving your miracle so many years ago,
    <br>what lessons have you learned in maintaining your healing?
    <br>You have got to keep this relationship with God.
    <br>You must see Him as the everything of your life.
    <br>Christ Himself said to the man at the synagogue
    <br>that unless you keep on following Me, something worse will happen to you, so, stop sinning.
    <br>I was so brought under the whole thing when I went to Lagos, initially, of "Sin no more."
    <br>I think this is still the message.
    <br>It is not only about to stop sinning.
    <br>God doesn't heal you just to get well.
    <br>He heals you to follow Him, to be a real follower of Christ.
    <br>He wants you to be His disciple.
    <br>That is why He heals you.
    <br>The message must go out that if you've got to maintain your relationship with Christ,
    <br>the more you testify, the easier it gets.
    <br>We know that healing, deliverance and blessing is not an end in itself
    <br>but a means to an end which is the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Like you rightly said, that is what it is all about;
    <br>to follow Jesus Christ until you are glorified at last.
    <br>What advice do you have for people who are planning on visiting a ministry like The SCOAN?
    <br>Because of what happened to me, many people went to Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>They often came here and said that they wanted to meet me
    <br>because they saw me on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>"I hear your testimony and want to meet you in person."
    <br>If you are a serious man or woman and you are serious with God,
    <br>go there and find that spiritual healing.
    <br>How do you prepare yourself for this?
    <br>This is to have faith in what God is doing.
    <br>That faith is absolutely critical.
    <br>You have got to put your faith in God.
    <br>Faith comes from God and He will give you that faith
    <br>to go there and to say that you will go and come back, changed.
    <br>My advice is that if you really want to go there,
    <br>really expect that God will do something.
    <br>We saw on the video that you were using hearing aids before
    <br>and after Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you, you removed the hearing aids
    <br>and your hearing was restored.
    <br>Have you ever started using the hearing aid again or are you using it right now?
    <br>I took them out that day.
    <br>He said to me, "Take them out and don't put them back."
    <br>For the past 13 years, I never used them again.
    <br>It was of no need for me to use it again.
    <br>Initially, there was a sentence that my hearing would disappear and it disappeared.
    <br>This is the big thing that we as Christians always want to hear
    <br>and the people of the world want to hear.
    <br>It is God doing a permanent thing.
    <br>Can God really do that?
    <br>Yes, He restored my hearing.
    <br>It has been normal ever since.
    <br>He gave me a promise that He would keep me and look after me and He does that.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah. Thank God that you obeyed that instruction in righteousness
    <br>that the prophet gave you not to put those hearing aids back and God perfected that healing.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>We believe, as the prophet says, "Better is not good enough, the best is yet to come."
    <br>Dr Gerrie turns his head sideways, giving the cameraman opportunity to zoom in on his ears.
    <br>It is clear that there is no hearing aid inserted in either of his ears.
    <br>When Jesus Christ heals us, He heals us effectually, He heals us completely.
    <br>Thank you so much, Dr Gerrie for speaking to us today and God bless you.
    <br>It is my privilege, Eugene.
    <br>Viewers , we know that you have been blessed by this faith building testimony of Dr Gerrie,
    <br>a medical practitioner who was healed of deafness so many years ago
    <br>and who managed to maintain his healing by staying true to Jesus Christ.
    <br>Healing is not an end in itself but a means to an end,
    <br>which is the salvation of your soul.
    <br>The sole end and purpose of all our activities here on earth
    <br>is the salvation of your soul.
    <br>When you receive a touch from Jesus Christ, remember to follow Him,
    <br>to stay true to Him until you are glorified at last.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says that a lasting solution comes
    <br>through a lasting relationship with Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank you for your time, viewers.
    <br>We know that your faith has been lifted up.
    <br>Stay connected to Emmanuel TV, stay blessed and God bless you.
    <br>Send us your own testimony and you will be blessed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The interview has come to an end but the joy of listening to this life changing testimony
    <br>remains in our hearts.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the Repairer and Restorer.
    <br>Remember, no matter our situation, when we express the necessary trust in Christ Jesus,
    <br>His duty is to raise us from death to life and then restore the wholeness and fellowship.
    <br>Dr Gerrie joyfully appreciates the Emmanuel TV Team member,
    <br>knowing that when you testify what God Almighty has done in your life,
    <br>He will do it again and again.
    <br>What is your testimony?
    <br>Share it, because someone needs your testimony to help them
    <br>to get out of their desperate setback.
