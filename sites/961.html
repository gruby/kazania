    <br>Viewers all over the world, we have been on the journey of salvation.
    <br>I know you have been listening to the message 'The Beauty Of Life'.
    <br>The beauty of life does not depend on how happy we are,
    <br>but on how happy others can be because of us.
    <br>How many people are happy because of you?
    <br>How many lives have you touched today?
    <br>Don't forget, somebody needs something you possess.
    <br>It may be your love, it may be your smile with all your heart.
    <br>It may be your money.
    <br>You may say you are poor.
    <br>You may be surprised to see someone who is poorer than you are.
    <br>This means, someone is in need of us.
    <br>No matter how little, how small - someone is in need of us.
    <br>If you cannot part with little, you will not be able to part with much.
    <br>Viewers, the journey of salvation.
    <br>I break all self-will within your heart - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every self-will within your heart, be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>What you want to do is not what you are doing.
    <br>Every self-will be broken, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Let the will of God be done!
    <br>Viewers, begin to confess those self-wills, fleshly desires,
    <br>those things that come to tempt you, those things you try to resist.
    <br>What you want to do is not what you find yourself doing.
    <br>If that, it is the sin in your life.
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be disconnected!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T. B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Salvation - ready to be delivered.
    <br>I can see you being delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Self-thought, self-will within your heart.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>For the Word of God to dominate your heart, you need to be delivered
    <br>and when you are delivered, you begin to enjoy the Word of God.
    <br>Then, this can influence your character and your conduct.
    <br>You are disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let the will of God be done!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T. B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers, say after me, Take more of me, Lord, give me more of You -
    <br>more of Your obedience, faithfulness, kindness, purity, holiness.
    <br>Take more of me, oh Holy Spirit!
    <br>Take more of me - more of me, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Give me more of You, Lord.
    <br>Holy Spirit, give me more of You, Lord!
    <br>More of You, Lord!
    <br>More of Your holiness, purity, faithfulness, obedience, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I can hear you being saved.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T. B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Worship Him! Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T. B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers all over the world, your temple, your body is not its place (affliction, sickness).
    <br>You affliction in their temple - say, "Affliction in my body, I command you out!"
    <br>It can be in your blood - whatever, wherever it is, begin to flush them out!
    <br>In your bones, in your kidneys - I command healing, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your liver!
    <br>Wherever that affliction, wherever that pain - open your lips and begin to command them out!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T. B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T. B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
