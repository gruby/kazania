  <p>    
    <br>Can I talk to you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>There is an embarrassment in your life.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by an embarrassment?
    <br>Something you cannot tell anyone.
    <br>It is something you don't want anyone to know.
    <br>It's only you.
    <br>You keep it to yourself and you don't want people to know.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Do you want me to mention it?
    <br>No
    <br>I should not mention it?
    <br>No, let us put shame to satan.
    <br>Bedwetting.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You just sleep and you see yourself wetting the bed.
    <br>As I am saying it, it is gone.
    <br>It is gone.
    <br>Father, thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God, I have good news to share.
    <br>My name is Elysia Straub. I come from the United States.
    <br>Who is the sister besides you here?
    <br>This here is my beautiful mother Galina.
    <br>Last week, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave me a prophecy.
    <br>He walked up to me and said, "Sister, you have something that you don't want to share with anyone.
    <br>You have a secret".
    <br>I know, I didn't say yes.
    <br>He said that it was a generational curse, which was bedwetting.
    <br>Afterwards, he placed his hand upon me.
    <br>I fell to the ground. I felt released, free.
    <br>I felt the Holy Spirit inside of me.
    <br>Tell us more about this problem of bedwetting, how it started and how it really affected your life negatively?
    <br>I had this problem of bedwetting since childhood.
    <br>Every time I went to other peoples' places, I'd feel ashamed about it.
    <br>I felt isolated, rejected. I felt that I was not accepted for who I am.
    <br>This is something that has been happening to you right from childhood that you have been bedwetting.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Explain to us - each time it happened, how did it affect you negatively - both socially and
    <br>in terms of your relationship with others? How did it make you feel?
    <br>Normally when I would go to sleep - I am usually a light sleeper -
    <br>every time before the middle of the night, when I slept very deeply, I felt like someone was holding me down.
    <br>It won't let me go. The only time when I'd wake up is when I felt wet.
    <br>I felt ashamed, so I kept it as a secret from others.
    <br>I felt isolated. I didn't want to be with anyone else after this happened. I felt guilty inside.
    <br>You mentioned at the beginning that this was actually a generational curse.
    <br>Can you explain more about how this affected the whole family?
    <br>I wasn't the only one; I also had a family member,
    <br>who's my uncle and also had this issue. He felt very ashamed of it.
    <br>So did my other family members, such as my little cousins.
    <br>As a young lady looking ahead to the future,
    <br>how did you feel knowing that you had this problem in terms of moving forward in life,
    <br>maybe wanting to get married later on?
    <br>How did it make you feel knowing that you had this terrible secret?
    <br>I felt that there was no hope for me.
    <br>I thought about what would happen to me in the future, "Will this continue,
    <br>will I get married, will my children and my children's children have the same generational curse?"
    <br>We really understand from our sister how serious this problem of bedwetting was.
    <br>You said that you kept this as a secret, is that right?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Wow. Tell us - how did you come to hear about The SCOAN
    <br>and actually be here today in the presence of God.
    <br>I heard about The SCOAN through family members.
    <br>They knew I had this problem, so they told my mother, and we also watched the YouTube videos.
    <br>OK, so you learned about the ministry and thank God you came here.
    <br>Tell us - how did you feel last week, when the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua approached you
    <br>and gave you this word of prophecy, something you did not disclose to him -
    <br>a secret that you kept, that only you and your family members knew about.
    <br>How did you feel when this word of prophecy was given?
    <br>When he first came up to me...
    <br>During screening, when I was supposed to write down my problems, I did not add bedwetting.
    <br>When the Prophet came up to me, he said exactly what I should have put on the placard.
    <br>I was so shocked; this was exactly why I came here - to be freed from this curse.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I hope we understand our sister.
    <br>She said that when she was asked about her problems before,
    <br>she was too ashamed to even mention bedwetting on her placard
    <br>when it was time for her to go to the prayer line.
    <br>But God, through Prophet T.B. Joshua revealed exactly what her problem was
    <br>and that word of prophecy is what we are seeing on the screen here.
    <br>Sister, we saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for you and you fell to the ground.
    <br>What happened when he prayed for you, what were your experiences?
    <br>I felt released. I felt lighter. I felt free in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Wow. Ever since that prayer and that prophecy, tell us your experiences.
    <br>Ever since that day happened, I have been free, I have been dry on my bed,
    <br>I feel enlightened, happy and joyful.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You said before that in your sleep, you felt something pressing you down,
    <br>a nightmare attacking you, pressing you down, until you woke up and found the bed wet.
    <br>Tell us - after this deliverance and prophecy, what have been your experiences in your dreams?
    <br>Have you had such experiences repeat itself?
    <br>It's been dry. I don't feel anyone pushing me down anymore.
    <br>I felt like the Holy Spirit is lifting me up, that I am free completely.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>What a miraculous wonderful testimony!
    <br>As the Prophet said during that prophecy, "As I say it now, it is finished".
    <br>Because indeed that word of prophecy contains both healing and deliverance.
    <br>It's a package that has both the question and answer.
    <br>We can see the evidence right now in the life of our sister.
    <br>Immediately after that prophetic message, she has not bedwetted again.
    <br>She is completely free from that terrible scourge of bedwetting right from her childhood.
    <br>Sister, what is your advice to people of God watching you right now?
    <br>My advice to everyone is to have hope. Never lose hope.
    <br>When you are facing a situation like this or any situation, it is not impossible with God.
    <br>He is not done with you. He is still continuing and has a plan for you.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Glory be to God. Now we just want to quickly hear from the sister beside you as well.
    <br>Sister, you are welcome. Just tell us your name, and where you are from.
    <br>My name is Galina Straub. I am from the United States.
    <br>Who is this sister beside you? Who is she to you?
    <br>This is my daughter, Elysia Straub.
    <br>Tell us on your own side - what can you say about the problem she was having,
    <br>how it really affected the whole family.
    <br>We had a generational curse in my family.
    <br>It passed on to her. She had been bedwetting since she was a child.
    <br>We have been praying, fasting for her and taking her to doctors.
    <br>They said she should be able to grow out of it but she never did.
    <br>How did you feel each time you saw that she was bedwetting?
    <br>Even at her age, how did that make you feel as someone very close to her?
    <br>I felt the shame. I felt bad for her and felt bad for me.
    <br>Like what did I do wrong? Why is this on her?
    <br>Did I do something wrong or maybe I should do something about it?
    <br>We tried everything we could but we did not have any results.
    <br>You were here last week when Prophet T.B. Joshua gave her that word of prophecy.
    <br>How did you feel as the prophecy was given to her?
    <br>I almost cried because this was exactly what we came here for.
    <br>She was ashamed; she didn't want to write things out.
    <br>He said exactly the words that she didn't want anybody to know.
    <br>This is the truth.
    <br>The Prophet said exactly what she had.
    <br>After the prophecy came, I knew that God had a plan for us.
    <br>I believe that this curse will be broken.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty. Since that word of prophecy and deliverance that came with it,
    <br>how has she been doing since then? How is her condition right now?
    <br>It has been great. I have been checking every day and night on her.
    <br>She's able to get up on her own to go to the bathroom.
    <br>She has been dry. I just want to thank God.
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He is still healing and delivering.
    <br>I just want to praise God for this church, and for Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you. Thank you so much. We really really appreciate it.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>Glory be to God. Indeed there are no natural words to describe it, except to say, "Thank You, Jesus!".
    <br>Finally, what is your word of advice to viewers around the world watching you right now?
    <br>My advice is to believe and trust in God.
    <br>His word is the same yesterday and today. Whatever He promises, He does it.
    <br>You just have to look for it.
    <br>I know this church is a great church. We see the result.
    <br>Keep praying and keep believing.
    <br>Come here, use the Anointing Water, anything you can do to get your deliverance, to get your answer.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus. We want to encourage this family now that Jesus Christ has intervened in this case,
    <br>continue to make the Word of God the standard for your lives.
    <br>We know the best is yet to come as you do so in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
