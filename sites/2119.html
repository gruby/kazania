    <br>If not for the condemnation and persecution, do you think I would be at this level that I am today?
    <br>What else again?
    <br>PERSECUTION Is A FREE ADVERT!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>I know the value of my trials.
    <br>The value is so great; they made the whole world know me.
    <br>It is a free advert.
    <br>PERSECUTION Is A FREE ADVERT!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>You can see there is no signpost, no signboard.
    <br>You cannot see any signboard of The Synagogue since the beginning of this church.
    <br>You are my advert. You are my signpost.
    <br>The question people used to ask me: Why not advert? Why not signboard at least in front of The Synagogue here?
    <br>You are supposed to see a big board.
    <br>I will carry my Bible; that should show you.
    <br>I will carry my Bible like this. I will say, "..."
    <br>But, you cannot find it anywhere.
    <br>Even in Lagos Island, everywhere.
    <br>When you are coming, look around. You will not see "The Synagogue Church Of All Nations" signboard.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because God has blessed me with free adverts.
    <br>PERSECUTION Is A FREE ADVERT!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Look, it takes a spirit of foolishness to hear something without going there and confirming.
    <br>Every genuine human being, a leader, every leader - you may be a leader now, you may be a leader tomorrow -
    <br>either you are still young and God has destined you to be a leader tomorrow.
    <br>Every one that God destines to be a leader,
    <br>when they hear something - it may take time - they will find a way to confirm what they hear.
    <br>In the process of confirmation, they become part of me, and I become part of them.
    <br>PERSECUTION Is A FREE ADVERT!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>This ministry has been around for the past 20 years.
    <br>If there is anyone out there that says he is 'elite',
    <br>a man of wisdom, understanding, and he's still not confirmed - through Emmanuel TV one day -
    <br>it means something is wrong.
    <br>It's true your confirmation now brought you here.
    <br>You were not just here; it was what you heard in the past.
    <br>In the process of confirming your information, you now find yourself; the same thing with our brother here.
    <br>The free advert is so gracious; it is a big blessing to me.
    <br>The free advert brought about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was on Nigerian National Television and local television.
    <br>When the miracle was showing, because of me, your former president said they should remove the miracle.
    <br>PERSECUTION Is A FREE ADVERT!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>And they removed the miracle and they stopped the miracle programme
    <br>on your national television and your local television.
    <br>And the body that guides the television stations in Nigeria brought about a law that
    <br>no 'miracle pastors' should be shown.
    <br>It was because of me; not because of anybody else.
    <br>That brought about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>PERSECUTION Is A FREE ADVERT!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>That brought about what? Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Are you listening to me?
    <br>Let me tell you. Sometimes you say, "One man is not good; that man is not good."
    <br>I pray that he will rest in peace, President Yar'Adua. Whether you like it or not, it is like a President you lost.
    <br>He was a great man.
    <br>I was here on my own without asking this man for honour.
    <br>I received a phone call. He said, "I will give you an honour - OFR." (Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic).
    <br>This is a man that does not share the same faith with me; he is a Muslim man.
    <br>I received a phone call, "I want to give you an honour."
    <br>I said, "Honour? I am a servant of God. What I am doing is not to receive an honour."
    <br>He said, "No, you deserve this honour."
    <br>I did not go myself to receive this honour and I sent my wife to go and receive the honour.
    <br>Nobody is aware of this because I don't put it in my name.
    <br>When you see 'T.B. Joshua' you will not see 'OFR', because nobody knows.
    <br>I said, "Ok. I am honoured by my nation". I sent my wife to receive the OFR.
    <br>The man did not know what to do to show that 'God is using you', even though he is not a Christian.
    <br>Some time when you are talking, saying "northerner, southerner, easterner", I keep laughing.
    <br>The issue is not 'northerner, easterner', but love. Nigeria is one.
    <br>I am just telling you a man from the northern part of Nigeria was a real Muslim man. Rest in peace, this man.
    <br>We had never met. He had never invited me for prayer.
    <br>But how he got to know and monitored all that had happened.
    <br>He said to me, I could remember,
    <br>that after looking at the number of people coming to this country from each port of entry in Nigeria,
    <br>he realised that I attracted the most foreigners.
    <br>You know, this is the first time you are hearing this from me,
    <br>but you never knew that I have an OFR; I have it.
    <br>It is not the number of years you spend, the nature or kind of death; how you die does not matter.
    <br>"I know the man". When you are looking, talking of those who ... you are saying whatever ...
    <br>You know, God's opinion is different from your opinion.
    <br>The opinion of God about that late President Yar'Adua is different from your opinion.
    <br>Your oil could not attract visitors, but anointing attracts visitors.
    <br>PERSECUTION Is A FREE ADVERT!!! | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Why I am saying this is that sometimes when you talk of north, south, Christianity, Muslim -
    <br>Love is the greatest!
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Love is the greatest!
    <br>Say: You talk of north, south, Christianity, a religious man, a Muslim -
    <br>Love is the greatest!
    <br>You keep talking of issues of religion - Christianity and so on - and you forget love.
    <br>Where is love?
    <br>The Bible says, "Love your neighbour as yourself!"
    <br>Your neighbour could be what?
    <br>Your neighbour could be your enemy, a pagan, a religious man, a Muslim.
    <br>The Bible says, "Love your neighbour!"
    <br>Which name do you see here? Is that not Umaru Musa Yar-Adua?
    <br>- Is this man a Christian?
    <br>- No.
    <br>Why did this man recognise what is happening here - this OFR - and he is a Muslim?
    <br>Love is what? The greatest!
    <br>Love is the greatest!
    <br>This means love is greater than everything you practise.
    <br>Whatever name you call it, the name Jesus is love.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>If you are talking of, "Is it a Muslim?".
    <br>- Are they the ones condemning me?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Are Muslims condemning me?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Are they the ones speaking against me?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Aunty, are they the ones saying you should not come here?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Do Muslims say you should not come here?
    <br>- No, sir.
    <br>So why are we deceiving ourselves?
    <br>Where there is love, you will come to me and I will go to you.
    <br>You want to know what I am doing, and I want to know what you are doing.
    <br>Love permits us to do findings.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Love permits us to do findings.
    <br>That is one of the characteristics of love.
    <br>The Lord says that love permits us to do findings.
    <br>He says, "Find out the truth and what?"
    <br>(The truth will set you free).
    <br>That is love.
