    <br>Viewers, you will not expect me to say, "Breakthrough".
    <br>Even if there is a breakthrough, without the Word of God in your heart,
    <br>will you be able to maintain breakthrough?
    <br>Don't let us deceive ourselves. Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>Even if there is a breakthrough for you and there is no Word of God in your heart,
    <br>how will you maintain it?
    <br>It's better not to have breakthrough than to have it and lose it.
    <br>Indeed, I hear breakthrough but I don't know how you will maintain it
    <br>because without the Word of God in your heart, it will be difficult to maintain.
    <br>What you have received in the past is what you are here for again today.
    <br>Your business was going well but suddenly went down.
    <br>You cannot maintain this blessing without the Word of God in your heart.
    <br>Look at your marriage: The thing was smooth but later...
    <br>You cannot maintain them without the Word of God in your heart.
    <br>Look at what is going on: things go...
    <br>You will not be able to maintain your life without the Word of God in your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My heart, hear the voice of God".
    <br>If I were you, this is what I would continue to meditate on.
    <br>Your heart is the real man.
    <br>You - just your appearance is a camouflage.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your appearance is a camouflage.
    <br>The real person is your heart".
    <br>Tell your neighbour; face your neighbour.
    <br>Say, "My appearance is a camouflage".
    <br>Maybe you may not understand the camouflage I am talking about.
    <br>You know soldiers? When they are going to war, they put on the uniform.
    <br>That uniform is a camouflage.
    <br>What is working in them is their heart;
    <br>how they control strategy and tactic, holding gun and ammunition.
    <br>But the uniform they put on is just... - anybody can wear uniform.
    <br>Say to your neighbour, "My appearance is a camouflage.
    <br>My heart is the main man".
    <br>Viewers, the Word in our heart is our contact with God.
    <br>I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Awake, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>The Holy Spirit is at the door of your heart,
    <br>knocking the door of your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>You must have a free heart.
    <br>By this free heart, your heart can contact the Holy Spirit,
    <br>have access to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Awake, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say to my heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Awake, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Like I have said:
    <br>Committing the Word of God to memory is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>Awake, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Learning the Hebrew, whatever language in the Bible, the history of the Books of the Bible
    <br>is valuable but does not bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Awake, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>To celebrate a new year is to celebrate it with all your heart.
    <br>Any celebration, if your heart does not act with the Word of God, nothing can be achieved.
    <br>In the name of God, nothing can be achieved.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, nothing can be achieved.
    <br>No one can say, "Jesus is the Lord" without the Word of God in the heart.
    <br>I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Whatever our heart engages on influences our conduct and our character.
    <br>Your heart, hear the voice of God, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Hear the voice of God, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The same heart, the Holy Spirit expresses Himself through.
    <br>He wants to talk to you through your heart.
    <br>Heart means your spirit.
    <br>I say to your heart, "Awake, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Awake, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Now, how do we awake this heart?
    <br>The Bible says you become an integral part of the Word of God by meditation.
    <br>Awake, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Become an integral part, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
