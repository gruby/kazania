    <br>BREAKING NEWS
    <br>Where there is no vision, people perish. (Proverbs 29:18)
    <br>Let us listen to what Prophet T.B. Joshua said twelve years ago on Sunday, December 28, 2008,
    <br>concerning the crisis we are in.
    <br>In a prophetic message, he warned us of what was to come in the future,
    <br>stating it was a long time prophecy, that there would be an economic crisis that would humble everyone.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>There will be economic crisis.
    <br>You are to cut your coat according to your size.
    <br>Those of you that have surplus -
    <br>whatever you can do now to live moderate...
    <br>The only way you can be saved - if your treasure is in the hands of God.
    <br>There will be economic crisis - it's coming and it's everywhere.
    <br>You will be forced to be humble.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You will be forced to be humble."
    <br>There will be economic war because there is not enough money to fight war.
    <br>There will be crisis in economy.
    <br>Countries that rely on the mineral resources like oil, they should quickly look beyond oil.
    <br>I'm just telling you long time prophecy, not immediate -
    <br>what you can begin to prepare yourself for now.
    <br>You that are into this - you have surplus now.
    <br>What can you do now?
    <br>Because this surplus will be forced to reduce.
    <br>So, you pray for the whole world.
    <br>Remember, trial is the soil in which faith flourishes.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Trial is the soil in which faith flourishes.]
    <br>You are a faith man. I am a faith man.
    <br>There is no fear.
    <br>As a faith man, there is no fear.
    <br>Trial is the soil in which a man of faith flourishes.
    <br>Three years later on Sunday, October 16, 2011,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke further about the economic crisis that was to come.
    <br>Let us listen to the words of Prophet T.B. Joshua nine years ago.
    <br>I said to you there would be economic crisis.
    <br>The war the whole world will face now is economic war.
    <br>You will see every nation, every country will come out,
    <br>going on the street, protesting.
    <br>You have not seen anything - write it down.
    <br>Everyone will be humbled.
    <br>Those who rely on oil, mineral resources - they should look beyond
    <br>because there will not even be enough money to buy oil.
    <br>There is something God wants to achieve concerning this.
    <br>God wants to achieve humility to the core.
    <br>He wants everybody to be on their knees,
    <br>every nation to be on their knees.
    <br>After that, the solution will come.
    <br>That is what God wants to achieve.
    <br>Whatever you have now, cut your coat according to your size.
    <br>If you have surplus now, please that surplus - whatever you can do now
    <br>before that surplus will go away.
    <br>Because if you have too much, people will be out there to attack you.
    <br>They will attack you physically.
    <br>The time is coming and it has come.
    <br>Two years later, on Sunday, December 29, 2013, once again Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied
    <br>about the coming economic crisis worldwide where countries would become broke.
    <br>Let us listen to the words of Prophet T.B. Joshua seven years ago.
    <br>Cash flow - forget it.
    <br>People will be broke; countries will be broke.
    <br>A single person can be richer than a country.
    <br>Your oil - you will drink them.
    <br>Whatever your country has discovered in terms of mineral resources
    <br>and it has been a source of income - causing corruption, causing fights,
    <br>people living flamboyantly - those things - nobody will buy them.
    <br>The price will drop drastically.
    <br>So, I want to say to you, we have to return to the farm - fishing, cattle rearing.
    <br>This is where we are coming from.
    <br>We have to return back there.
    <br>On Monday, April 20, 2020, Prophet T.B. Joshua addressed the world
    <br>concerning the current situation with this official message on Facebook.
    <br>BREAKING NEWS
    <br>THE WAY OUT
    <br>T.B. Joshua, what can you say about the issue of virus?
    <br>Why are ministers of God not praying for virus patients?
    <br>Virus is an issue of the governments.
    <br>Its real origins have to do with mistakes in critical international research.
    <br>Since their body language is understood, we have to give to Caesar what is Caesar's (Matthew 22:21) -
    <br>that is the position of the ministers of God.
    <br>In today's world, warfare is no longer about physical weapons;
    <br>this is one of the silent but devastating weapons of the contemporary world.
    <br>During my last address on 5th April, 2020,
    <br>I mentioned that this was an error in advanced technology.
    <br>It is all about error.
    <br>That nature is involved can be no excuse,
    <br>as this has led to the deaths of many innocent people all over the world.
    <br>It is an attack on the nature of God - the air.
    <br>Thank God that nature is fighting back; nature is eliminating it in its own way.
    <br>It is getting to its peak and is coming down.
    <br>Naturally, it will go the way it came.
    <br>This is one of the things the Bible says will happen in the end time -
    <br>perilous seasons when fear will rule the land.
    <br>As I said, I see it as an error in advanced technology.
    <br>In the nearest future, expect this kind of error - in retaliation.
    <br>Let us pray to avert this.
    <br>In all, it is coming to an end!
    <br>Finally, "hardship virus" is more dangerous than virus.
    <br>The presidents of the nations should open up the economy.
    <br>The more we delay in opening up the economy, the more we will face a worse situation afterwards.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>This is a prophetic message for the world.
