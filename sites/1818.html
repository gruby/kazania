  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, viewers all around the world, and win today! 
    <br>Once again, we welcome you to the Emmanuel TV Studios here in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Yes, last week, Prophet T.B. Joshua went to the prayer mountain
    <br>to pray for viewers all around the world.
    <br>I mean, he offered a powerful prayer of healing,
    <br>breaking the chains that satan might have used to connect them to himself,
    <br>including that of COVID-19. 
    <br>So, we want to watch a clip of that event.
    <br>For those who are on the sickbed, Father, I declare them free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive your deliverance, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Receive your healing, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever sickness in your body, fluids, organs, whatever name they call it - COVID-19,
    <br>Whatever affliction - receive your deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive your cure, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive your healing, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Never a sickness, never a disease Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Receive your freedom, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your business, finances, marriage - it is well!
    <br>It is well
    <br>In the name of Jesus
    <br>It is well in your business today
    <br>In your finances, career, marriage, family - be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>chain of affliction, chain of hardship, chain of poverty,
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see chains broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see chains of affliction broken!
    <br>I can see chains of hardship broken!
    <br>I can see chains of COVID-19 broken, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see chains of career failure, I can see chains of financial failure,
    <br>I can see chains of curses - generational curses -
    <br>I can see chains broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
    <br>To the glory of God, we have received a multitude of emails from viewers all around the world,
    <br>most of them testifying of receiving their healing from this deadly virus, COVID-19,
    <br>after joining Prophet T.B. Joshua in prayer.
    <br>Right now, viewers, we want to share with you just a few of those testimonies to encourage you in your faith,
    <br>to let you know that even though you're in a period of lockdown, your faith is not locked down.
    <br>They are testimonies of people who have recieved healing and deliverance from COVID-19.
    <br>Yes, you can be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remember, the Gospel of God's grace challenges and changes everything. 
    <br>To God's power, nothing is impossible!
    <br>Viewers, the people we are about to listen to now - Jesus is as close to you as He is to them.
    <br>So, as you rejoice with them, as you appreciate God for what he has done in their lives,
    <br>definitely, He will do it in your own life too, in Jesus' name! 
    <br>Once again, we want to remind you:
    <br>These prayers on Emmanuel TV from Prophet T.B. Joshua at the prayer mountain,
    <br>they are not time-bound,
    <br>so any time you watch them on Emmanuel TV, the presence of the Most High God is maintained. 
    <br>Yes, you are right.
    <br>Once again, viewers all over the world, we want to thank you so much.
    <br>Yes, we want to thank God because every influence of COVID-19 is being broken!
    <br>And today by the grace of God, we have been receiving emails from thousands of viewers all around the world,
    <br>testifying to the goodness of God after praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>People are receiving healing, getting recovered from COVID-19.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never an affliction He cannot cure.
    <br>You see, thousands of emails are here, as I said earlier.
    <br>I mean, those who sent testimonies of how God healed them.
    <br>But remember, this COVID-19 is a stigma,
    <br>COVID-19 is hell to people of the world.
    <br>A lot of people are receiving stigma, embarassment, humiliation
    <br>but, we want you to know, viewers all around the world,
    <br>that Jesus Christ healed and He still heals all manner of sickness, including that of COVID-19.
    <br>And because of that, we are here today to share testimonies to the glory of God.
    <br>We have many but because of time, we are going to share a few out of them.
    <br>We shall show you some of the pictures, photos of those who are healed from this virus.
    <br>We have pictures, before and after, of their healing
    <br>and we believe that as you listen to these testimonies, your life will not remain the same, in Jesus' name! 
    <br>Let me start with this person called Carla from France.
    <br>"My name is Carla, I live in Paris Region in France.
    <br>Yesterday, the doctor told me that I had the coronavirus, and my companion too.
    <br>We were in contact with his family last week, 
    <br>and several other people, without knowing that we had the virus.
    <br>I beg you, people of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, I need your prayer."
    <br>After a few days, the same woman wrote, and she says,
    <br>"I want to thank you all for supporting me and my family because I had coronavirus and my companion too.
    <br>My companion was healed after three days and his parents too.
    <br>Our 3 1/2 year-old daughter was also healed miraculously! 
    <br>I prayed along with Prophet T.B. Joshua and I followed every instruction given by the man of God.
    <br>Today, I am negative to COVID-19.
    <br>Glory be to God; thank You, Jesus!
    <br>That is a powerful testimony!
    <br>And don't forget, I also have lots of testimonies here!
    <br>The Bible says that we overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimonies.
    <br>If millions of this generation are to believe,
    <br>they must see proof that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>On that note, I will be reading one powerful testimony of someone who was healed of COVID-19.
    <br>She is from one of the states in Nigeria.
    <br>It says, "My name is Favour and I live in one of the states in Nigeria.
    <br>I want to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua for rescuing my husband from coronavirus.
    <br>He was sick for more than a week.
    <br>He complained of headaches, sore throat, fever and shortage of breath..."
    <br>I mean, these were the symptoms that...
    <br>"...and the last thing was, he fainted twice. 
    <br>That was when I knew he was having the virus.
    <br>The sickness was so severe.
    <br>I emailed my prayer request to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations
    <br>and gloriously, when the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua went to the prayer mountain to pray,
    <br>he offered the prayer of faith for healing for those who were afflicted with coronavirus.
    <br>And we joined in with that prayer."
    <br>She says,
    <br>"I want to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua for delivering my husband from the spirit of death.
    <br>Since that time, my husband has been completely healed of all the symptoms.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua and thank you, Emmanuel TV!
    <br>My hope of glory!"
    <br>Isn't that wonderful!
    <br>She also sent her pictures and evidence of her healing
    <br>but because of the stigma linked to this virus, we will not be able to show them.
    <br>But definitely, we give the glory to God for what He has done in her life.
    <br>You know, viewers, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Like I said, we have many of these testimonies, and I want to take another one.
    <br>Let me take this person by the name of Jane.
    <br>"Dear people of God, please, I kindly ask you to pray for my brother Thomas, who is sick at his home in the UK.
    <br>He is coronavirus positive.
    <br>His wife has been calling the Emmanuel TV prayer line and we are also standing in the gap,
    <br>for the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua to reach out His healing hands to him."
    <br>And to God be the glory, a few days later, Mrs Jane wrote,
    <br>Dear people of God, I am so happy to let you know that God heard and answered your prayers over my brother.
    <br>Thomas was tested coronavirus positive.
    <br>He had contracted the disease at the hospital were he works as a nurse in the UK.
    <br>He is now free from coronavirus, completely healed from this deadly disease!
    <br>He has now restarted his work and is doing his normal duties as before.
    <br>I thank you all, people of God, for your time and prayers for my brother.
    <br>I also thank God for His miraculous touch on my brother.
    <br>Glory be to God!"
    <br>Testimonies abound! Please give us time to share one more testimony.
    <br>I have to read this testimony; it is a wonderful one.
    <br>This person is from Canada.
    <br>This is a picture of the healing, before and after, 
    <br>when she was informed by the doctors that she had this COVID-19 disease.
    <br>She writes, "I am from Canada, and for reasons best known to me, I want to withold my name.
    <br>My daughter and I had the symptoms of the coronavirus.
    <br>I felt very weak and my daughter also suffered from a lot of fever and a cough.
    <br>After I sent my prayer request to Emmanuel TV, the man of God went to the prayer mountain
    <br>and I joined in that prayer along with my daughter.
    <br>After that prayer, all the symptoms disappeared!
    <br>No more sore throat, fever, chills, or loss of appetite!
    <br>I later went for a COVID-19 screening test; it was negative!"
    <br>She says, "Thank You, Lord Jesus.
    <br>Thank you, Emmanuel TV; thank you, T.B. Joshua; thank you, prayer warriors.
    <br>Only a miracle of Jesus could have healed me so quickly.
    <br>I declare that as it came out of my house, it will never return, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>Amen! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>She says, "With me, I have the positive and negative tests.
    <br>I am free of COVID-19."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Jesus, what a touching testimony.
    <br>We've seen that both young and old, older and oldest can all receive their healing,
    <br>that age is not a criterion, location is not a criterion.
    <br>you just need the name of Jesus Christ working in the Spirit.
    <br>I love it that this last testimony from Yinka was a nurse, because at the prayer mountain, if you remember,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua specifically prayed for those in the health profession.
    <br>Being a nurse does not mean you cannot get sick
    <br>but they too can be partaking of the power and blessing of God.
    <br>So, it is wonderful to hear the testimonies from our health workers as well, to the Glory of God!
    <br>We will not stop thanking God for breaking every yoke of COVID-19
    <br>in the lives of the people, in Jesus' name! 
    <br>Amen! Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed and hope restored.
    <br>Viewers, as you are listening to these testimonies, we want your faith to shift to another level.
    <br>Whatever situation you are having; it could be COVID-19.
    <br>Remember, this is a sickness that has defied medical solution until now
    <br>but to the glory of God, Jesus Christ is still on the throne, setting His people free!
    <br>If you have any affliction, just stretch out your hand when the man of God is praying,
    <br>believe, act faith, because faith is expecting God to do what He has promised.
    <br>His Word says He will heal you, so He is going to heal you.
    <br>All you need is to have faith; believing is your connection.
    <br>Just believe, and your healing is as close to you as you can imagine. Amen!
