    <br>Prayer Time
    <br>Viewers all over the world, what is the situation you are facing? Remember the Bible says,
    <br>all things are possible for him who believes. As you pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>ask Jesus to add to your faith, to give you the necessary faith to believe
    <br>that whatever you are asking for can be done, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's pray for all the viewers around the world.
    <br>We want to say, "Thank you, viewers."
    <br>Whatever medium you are using to watch this programme, either on the internet, or whichever way,
    <br>I want to bless you, right now.
    <br>Father, we thank You for Your people.
    <br>What a revelation!
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>Viewers listen to me; this is the voice of God.
    <br>I can hear breakthrough!
    <br>Viewers, listen to me once again. This is the voice of God.
    <br>I can hear breakthrough.
    <br>Breakthrough in your business; I can hear breakthrough.
    <br>Breakthrough in your finances; I can hear breakthrough.
    <br>Breakthrough in your marital life; I can hear breakthrough.
    <br>Breakthrough in your career, in your destiny, in your health.
    <br>Breakthrough, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Praying For the Viewers
    <br>Touch The Screen In Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>In whatever way, in whichever way limitation in your faith, belief, business, whatever limitation,
    <br>in whichever way you are having this limitation - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In whichever way, it could be in your faith, belief, business, finances, career, marital life.
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you rejoicing in the spirit.
    <br>This is a revelation.
    <br>It is God's will, right now, to deliver you.
    <br>You are delivered, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>It is His will to set you free.
    <br>In whichever way there is bondage in your life - be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Say after me, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Viewers at home say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Thank you because I see you being set free.
    <br>Thank you because I see you being delivered.
    <br>Right now, say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Those who say thank you Jesus - they are set free.
    <br>Say, "Thank You Jesus!"
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Praying For The Viewers
    <br>Touch The Screen In Faith In Jesus' Name
