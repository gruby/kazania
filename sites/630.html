    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>During The SCOAN live Sunday service, Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke forth a prophetic message
    <br>regarding a hijacked plane and revealed the outcome of the incident.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I'm seeing a balloon.
    <br>It was hijacked and people were inside.
    <br>But at the end of the day, they were able to rescue the balloon and the people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Breaking news!
    <br>But this one, there is victory for it.
    <br>There will be victory. There will be rescue.
    <br>They will rescue the balloon and the people.
    <br>They will not be able to blow anything
    <br>and they will rescue them and bring it down.
    <br>We thank God. Give thanks to God.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
