  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Georgiana Saffa, born in Sierra Leone, settled down in UK.
    <br>I'm 55 years old.
    <br>I have been living in the UK for 25 years.
    <br>All my life in the UK had been full of sickness.
    <br>I never had any quality time in the UK.
    <br>I started to work, settled down and bought houses.
    <br>I have about three houses in London through the job I was doing – a very good job -
    <br>helping women in the community who were trying to settle down in the country,
    <br>trying to go to college, start their own business or get a job.
    <br>That was the job I was doing – very demanding – running around for them.
    <br>At one stage, they even called my house, Social Services house
    <br>because as soon as somebody arrived, the first person they would call was me.
    <br>... accommodation problem, everything.
    <br>The job was going very well for me in London.
    <br>My life was very good; I was driving a very good, brand new car.
    <br>In London, we drive by registration; every year, the car that comes out -
    <br>you'll drive it and people will think you have money.
    <br>I didn't have any problems.
    <br>At one stage, the government gave me a car to drive.
    <br>I was very popular in London.
    <br>I got a job in the MP's office.
    <br>I became a campaign manager for the whole of Westminster – North.
    <br>I was employed in this office which is part of the Labour Party.
    <br>Whenever elections came up, I was one of the permanent staff that participated in the process.
    <br>I went to the polling station, amongst other things.
    <br>This is me on the picture with the MP - Karen Buck, in Westminster City Council.
    <br>It is the office I used to work in.
    <br>She was my very close friend.
    <br>This is our president.
    <br>When he came to London, they told him that I was helping a lot of Sierra Leoneans that were refugees.
    <br>I was the one helping them around and the president was happy about it.
    <br>That's my last son - this is the one they took from me when I was in the hospital.
    <br>Now, he is 17 years old.
    <br>These are my two daughters - about three weeks ago they visited me in Ghana for the first time.
    <br>Everything was going very well for me.
    <br>Then, I started to have chronic headaches.
    <br>I told my younger sister who is a nurse about my headache and inability to sleep.
    <br>She replied that it was alarming and that I should go to my doctor for a brain scan.
    <br>At that time, I was still working but my behaviour in the office was so bad
    <br>that they set up a camera to monitor me in the office, without my knowledge.
    <br>So all along, while I was fighting my colleagues, they were recording it.
    <br>One day, the manager rang me and told me that he wanted to see me in the office, that there was a problem.
    <br>I said, "OK, I will come".
    <br>When I got there, they played back the recordings of all my aggressive misbehaviours.
    <br>Even the way I spoke to customers on the phone was all recorded.
    <br>They told me that my situation was very severe and so they could no longer employ me.
    <br>They told me to go and seek for help.
    <br>Immediately I told my sister, she said I should see my doctor.
    <br>I was sent for an MRI scan.
    <br>The first scan that was done, I was told that the nerves between my brain cells were becoming swollen.
    <br>That was why I was getting blood clots on my eyes.
    <br>I couldn’t sleep properly.
    <br>All these problems were arising.
    <br>I was put on medication.
    <br>Initially, it was one but I ended up on 14 different types of medication.
    <br>Some of them were for my mood and some caused me kidney problems.
    <br>But I thank God for Jesus that it has gone.
    <br>My problems are gone.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>These documents were from my GP in London stating the medication I was on.
    <br>I had medication for mood, sleep, asthma and gas.
    <br>I had bleeding because of too much medication in my system.
    <br>All that caused me headaches.
    <br>I was going through a lot of problems.
    <br>These problems became a big agony for me such that my children had to be taken away from me immediately.
    <br>I was not happy having my children taken away from me but they were little and didn't have a choice,
    <br>unless you are 16 years of age.
    <br>Babies can be taken away.
    <br>My children were put into foster care.
    <br>Seeing my children was a problem for me.
    <br>It took a while for me to come to myself.
    <br>They started to monitor me with my children.
    <br>Video cameras would be on me to see the way I behaved with them.
    <br>After one or two hours, I would be told that the meeting with my children was over.
    <br>At that time, I would get pregnant by different types of men who would take advantage of me.
    <br>I had about eight abortions and seven children by different fathers.
    <br>Some of them didn’t even know their fathers.
    <br>They would ask me where their dad was and I would reply that I didn't know -
    <br>at that time, I was on drugs and very sick.
    <br>You mean to say, madam - because of this problem, you had seven children with six different men?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And majority of your children don't know who their father is?
    <br>Of course, yes.
    <br>Even now, I don't know what to tell them.
    <br>All this led me being neglected, even by my family, 15 of whom I brought to London.
    <br>None of them came to help me.
    <br>I was very neglected.
    <br>Nobody cared about my health.
    <br>They were even laughing at me, stating that I was a mad woman – mentally ill, that I was finished.
    <br>Because of this sickness, I gave my life to Christ.
    <br>I was born as a Muslim.
    <br>OK. Sorry, before going ahead, madam - you mentioned that because the situation became so serious,
    <br>the government actually had to take your children from you.
    <br>What was your behaviour at home that caused the government to come and
    <br>take all of your seven children away from you, to put them into foster care?
    <br>I couldn’t look after myself or my children.
    <br>They were neglected – going to school dirty.
    <br>Sometimes, they would not even go to school.
    <br>In the morning, I would just close my door and say, "Today, no school!"
    <br>The school rang social services to inform them that my children were not coming to school.
    <br>Social services intervened, came to my house and took my children away from me.
    <br>Ms Georgiana Saffa
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>At that time, I wanted to commit suicide.
    <br>I was living on the third floor but they put me on the ground floor because of my suicide attempts.
    <br>OK, you said you attempted suicide.
    <br>How did you actually try to go about this, because of this mental disorder you were having at this time?
    <br>I attempted suicide about five or six times.
    <br>When they got to know, they put me on the ground floor and put me on Suicide Watch.
    <br>Even when I was in the toilet and bathroom, in my house, somebody had to be with me all the time -
    <br>watching me, taking record of how I was behaving and what was happening in my life.
    <br>When you were on the third floor - was it that you attempted to jump?
    <br>Yes, I attempted to jump about five times.
    <br>One of my daughters saw me doing it and told the police that her mum wanted to commit suicide.
    <br>I think we can all understand the severity of our sister's problem,
    <br>to the extent that she had to be monitored 24/7.
    <br>She was placed under Suicide Watch.
    <br>Someone had to be with her all the time because of the severity of her mental condition,
    <br>that actually pushed her to attempt suicide on numerous occasions.
    <br>Just before that you said that this actually led many different men to use and abuse you.
    <br>What do you mean by that?
    <br>How would you meet such men and how would they take advantage of you, in your mental problem?
    <br>I am a very popular woman in London.
    <br>I had male friends but had no relationship with them.
    <br>When they knew I was sick and not all that strong, some of them would come to me as friends,
    <br>stating that only they understood my problem, that I shouldn't worry as they would be with me
    <br>but as time went on, when I would tell them I was pregnant by them, they would just disappear.
    <br>With the pregnancies, the government said that as I could not look after myself,
    <br>I couldn't look after my children.
    <br>So, some of the children were taken from me while I was in hospital.
    <br>The day I would get pregnant, they would monitor me, take me to hospital and do everything for me.
    <br>The day of my delivery, I wouldn’t even go through labour; they would do a caesarean
    <br>because they didn’t want me to go through labour in case I killed the child.
    <br>They would just operate on me, take the baby and immediately,
    <br>the foster parents would be there to collect the baby from me.
    <br>I didn't breastfeed at all.
    <br>The moment you gave birth to these children, they were taken away by the government immediately?
    <br>Immediately, they had to go.
    <br>Some of them, I wouldn’t see for 10 or 15 years.
    <br>Some of them 22 years.
    <br>It is now they are coming into my life by the grace in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Once again, we are just asking this question for everyone to understand the severity of the situation.
    <br>Before our sister came to The SCOAN by the grace of God, she had given birth to so many children
    <br>but she was not even able to stay with them as a mother because of her mental condition,
    <br>even to the point that some of her last children, as she gave birth to them,
    <br>right there and then in the hospital, they were taken away and put into foster care.
    <br>They were brought up without even knowing their mother because of the severity of her condition.
    <br>So madam, you said that you had tried so many different means to get solution to this problem,
    <br>before you came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Can you just mention again some of the diverse places you went to, trying to get rid of this problem?
    <br>The first time I entered church - I have a friend, she is from Uganda – she came to my house
    <br>and told me that I was a very nice person but that I needed to follow her to church.
    <br>This lady ran after me for over six months.
    <br>One day, my mum was with me and told me to follow my friend to the church, that Jesus could heal me.
    <br>Immediately, I got up, changed my clothes and followed the lady to the church.
    <br>When she took me to church, I gave my life to Christ.
    <br>I started going to different churches, sleeping in the church, even on the floor.
    <br>I would lie down in the church.
    <br>People would laugh at me, jeering, "You haven't seen nothing yet. This is not going to go away".
    <br>I travelled to Mali, Senegal and Gambia to do different sacrifices.
    <br>People who knew me would contribute money and tell me to go to different places to seek healing.
    <br>You said that when you went to these countries, you did sacrifices.
    <br>What do you mean by that?
    <br>Can you explain what happened when you went there?
    <br>When I got for the sacrifices, they would tell me that the devil could do this and that.
    <br>They would tell me to buy a big cow, pray on it and my sickness would go away.
    <br>I even have some of the pictures of that.
    <br>My sickness would subdue but when I would return, it would get worse
    <br>and they would have to hospitalise me, straight into the mental hospital.
    <br>I would not receive any solution at all.
    <br>So, you were a regular customer at the psychiatric hospitals in London because of this condition?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Now, in the midst of all of this, you said earlier that by the special grace of God you went to Ghana,
    <br>where you were introduced to The SCOAN.
    <br>Repeat for us, madam - what happened when you had the opportunity to come here to The SCOAN
    <br>and receive the Morning Water.
    <br>When I came here with my friend, I was privileged to get the Morning Water
    <br>which my friend encouraged me to use.
    <br>I told her I had been using too many things.
    <br>She told me that this was my last bus stop.
    <br>I replied, "In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>I started taking it instead of the tablets.
    <br>The first day the Morning Water was ministered to me in The SCOAN, Ghana branch,
    <br>I went home and slept like a baby.
    <br>I slept so much that they had to wake me up to take breakfast.
    <br>I complained that I hadn’t slept for a long time, that they should let me sleep.
    <br>So before this time, how was your sleep like?
    <br>I was on two different types of sleeping tablets.
    <br>You must know how severe my situation was.
    <br>Not only one tablet; one is 48 mg, I have them with me, the other one is about 36 mg.
    <br>I had to take both tablets together to sleep but even with that, the sleep would not come.
    <br>I even overdosed myself at one stage.
    <br>I ended up in hospital.
    <br>I was put on a drip to flush all the medication that was in my system.
    <br>I nearly killed myself that time.
    <br>Our sister was actually dependant, addicted to taking tablets to be able to sleep.
    <br>After you received the Morning Water, that night you were able to sleep peacefully
    <br>for the first time in many years?
    <br>All my life.
    <br>I slept, I said that this one was very serious.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>As I was going back to London, I got the Morning Water and went with it.
    <br>While I was in London, I was ministering it throughout.
    <br>I refused to take my medication which raised an alarm among the doctors.
    <br>But luckily, the type of doctors that I had, they were very understanding; they were Christians.
    <br>They said that they understood that God could heal.
    <br>They asked me where I went and I told my GP that I was in The SCOAN in Nigeria.
    <br>He said, "You have done well; I am happy for you".

    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>That's not enough.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is a situation truly beyond the power of nature.
    <br>We don't try, in any way, to suggest that the medical doctors cannot help or assist people in this situation,
    <br>but it is clear for all to hear that our sister's case was beyond the power of human comprehension,
    <br>it was beyond the power of nature, it required divine intervention.
    <br>That is how after receiving the Morning Water, our sister stopped taking all the medications
    <br>she was dependant on, for so many years.
    <br>We can just see... what is it that you are holding there, madam?
    <br>These are some of the medications.
    <br>I didn’t want to see them anymore; so, I took them out of the packet and threw them away.
    <br>I just have the empty packets with me now because I don’t want to see them anymore.
    <br>They are my enemies.
    <br>Ms Georgiana Saffa
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Our sister is holding just few examples of the many different types of tablets she was taking to try
    <br>to relieve her situation - a very severe case of mental problem coupled with severe headaches,
    <br>alongside different other medical problems: hypertension, very severe eye problem.
    <br>So many different health complications that really crippled our sister's life.
    <br>She was doing very well in the UK in a prominent job.
    <br>Everything went downhill, after very severe migraine headaches struck.
    <br>But we give glory to God that she has been restored by our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Madam, as you are standing here right now to the glory of God, how is your health condition right now?
    <br>My health is perfect.
    <br>I have even lost weight as I am not taking the tablets anymore.
    <br>I was almost a size 22; now, I am size 16.
    <br>I am a brand new woman, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth and the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>That very severe headache that initially started with all these mental problems - do you mean it is gone?
    <br>It's gone.
    <br>I don’t experience any problems, not even sleeping problems; now, I sleep like a baby.
    <br>I can fall asleep even while sitting.
    <br>Now, I even take coffee so as not to sleep!
    <br>Can you believe that?
    <br>Wow, thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let's put our hands together one more time for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Finally madam, you said that right now, after Jesus Christ has restored your health, to the glory of God,
    <br>you have begun to reconcile with some of your children, that actually you had never seen,
    <br>right since birth, because of the severity of your problem.
    <br>You mean that by now, by the grace of God, you have been able to reconcile and meet with some of them?
    <br>Yes, three of my children came to visit me; they were in Ghana three weeks ago.
    <br>They came to visit me for the first time.
    <br>When they came, they were shocked and said, "Mummy, you have changed! You behave like a small girl."
    <br>I told them that I am a brand new woman now.
    <br>Everything has changed in my life.
    <br>They were surprised that I was behaving like a small girl.
    <br>Previously, we would fight and they would abandon me and go and stay in a hotel.
    <br>But now, we sleep, eat, go out and do everything together.
    <br>I went shopping with them.
    <br>I will follow them to the airport whereas before, I would say, "I am not going; I'm not feeling good".
    <br>But now, they are very happy.
    <br>I took them to The SCOAN branch in Ghana.
    <br>At the moment, they watch on Youtube.
    <br>They are very happy and have asked me to bring the Morning Water for them.
    <br>Hallelujah! This is indeed a radical transformation.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Wow, thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give all the glory to God.
    <br>There are no natural words to describe what Jesus Christ has done in the life of our sister, except to say,
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Finally, madam, this Morning Water that you are holding right now - what is your advice to the world,
    <br>and your encouragement to the world concerning the wonderful blessing of God
    <br>that you are holding right now, that God used as an instrument to restore your sanity, health,
    <br>after so many years wandering in such a terrible problem?
    <br>This Morning Water is so wonderful that I can't even go without it.
    <br>Don’t joke with it, no matter what type of situation you are going through, what type of sickness,
    <br>or problem you are facing.
    <br>Find the solution.
    <br>Morning Water is the best - it can solve...
    <br>If it can solve my problem – so big that even the British government knew about it,
    <br>it can solve anybody's problem.
    <br>There is no distance for Jesus.
    <br>Jesus is everywhere in this world.
    <br>The Morning Water – minister it very well and have confidence in it.
    <br>My brothers and sisters - it will never let you down, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
    <br>and the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Amen! One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
