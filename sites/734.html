  <p>    
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>A brother there, you have this spirit upon you.
    <br>The brother in this line here.
    <br>Can I help you?
    <br>I see you sitting down; you are sitting down.
    <br>Can I help you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can I help you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You have that spirit of man.
    <br>He's a gay. He is confessing he's a gay.
    <br>Don't worry. The name you called him is not the name God gave to me.
    <br>So we are not calling that name here.
    <br>We call it 'spirit of man'.
    <br>He has the spirit of man.
    <br>OK
    <br>My throat!
    <br>Come out, look here!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Since morning, he refused to stand up.
    <br>We have been praying.
    <br>The four times I looked in that direction, I asked, "Who is this man?" He refused to stand up.
    <br>He kept looking at what we are doing.
    <br>I was asking God, "Is he an armed robber?" I could not hear anything.
    <br>The Lord said, "No, he has the spirit of man.
    <br>He does not agree with what we are doing here".
    <br>He has been sitting down since morning; he refused to stand up.
    <br>I said, "Come, can I help you? You have the spirit of man." He came out to say he is this.
    <br>It is gone.
    <br>Next Sunday, when he comes out - there is nothing like that again.
    <br>He's free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Right now, the young man in question is here in our midst
    <br>to share his testimony to the glory of God Almighty.
    <br>Remember, we are giving this testimony to the shame of the devil and the glory of God.
    <br>We believe you will be educated and enlightened concerning how Jesus Christ is setting people free,
    <br>as you listen to his confession and testimony right now.
    <br>For the benefit of our viewers, our brother is not going to be speaking in English.
    <br>He's going to be speaking in a local dialect which will be translated for the benefit of everyone.
    <br>So, brother, you are very welcome here today. Please introduce yourself to us.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>Tanzania
    <br>He says his name is Patrick James and he comes from Tanzania.
    <br>So tell us brother, what was the prophecy you received last week here at The SCOAN?
    <br>Mr Patrick 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>The prophecy that I received that day, happened like this: The Prophet called me and I hid myself.
    <br>He called me again and I hid myself once again.
    <br>Then, I told my neighbour that he was speaking to him but my neighbour said it was me.
    <br>When I came out, he prophesied that I had the spirit of man inside me.
    <br>He said that last week, when he was in the service, the man of God called him out and pointed to him.
    <br>He said, "You, come to me".
    <br>When the man of God said that, he told his neighbour, "The man of God is speaking to you.
    <br>Why don't you stand up?" Without knowing that the man of God was referring to him.
    <br>Then, the man of God said, "No, it's not the other person. But it's you".
    <br>He then stood up and went to the man of God.
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>That spirit started to strangle me, and I felt something like an arrow hit my chest.
    <br>It strangled me to such an extent that I could neither talk nor pray.
    <br>He said that when the man of God pointed to him and said he has the spirit of man,
    <br>immediately, he started moving to the man of God, and that's when he started feeling something poking
    <br>in his chest and also something started to hook his neck.
    <br>Mr Patrick James (Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me, the spirit released me immediately.
    <br>He said that when he went to the man of God, the man of God stretched his hand and prayed for him.
    <br>Immediately the man of God prayed for him in the name of Jesus Christ, that's when the thing that was
    <br>hooking him, left him immediately.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty! Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, right now brother, can you please tell us how can you confirm
    <br>that word of prophecy to be true for your life.
    <br>Mr Patrick James (Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>It is very true; when I was ten years old in primary school,
    <br>one old man who was my neighbour called me one day.
    <br>He enticed me with chips, biscuits and other things to come to him and later, he raped me.
    <br>He said that it is true what the man of God told him.
    <br>Because when he was a young child of 10 years,
    <br>a man met him and forced himself on him by enticing him with sweets and things like that 
    <br>when he was coming back from school.
    <br>That is when the man forced himself on him and started to sleep with him.
    <br>So from there, he started having the urge for men.
    <br>Since that day, the spirit of man entered me and I felt like I was a lady.
    <br>When that spirit entered me, I saw myself sleeping in the ocean and I was a very beautiful lady -
    <br>more beautiful than all the women on earth.
    <br>Then, I didn't want to sleep with women anymore; I had the urge to sleep with men like me.
    <br>He said that ever since then he had a strong urge for men
    <br>and he never had an urge for women.
    <br>He started seeing himself in his dreams as a beautiful, very beautiful woman
    <br>and his attraction was towards men and not women anymore.
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>As I continued like that, I later dropped out of school.
    <br>I later moved from Arusha to the Mwanza region.
    <br>There, I continued sleeping with men for 15 years.
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>He said that since the age of 10 years, he has been sleeping with men.
    <br>He changed his habits.
    <br>He even stopped school and had to shift from the region in which he was to another region. 
    <br>When he went there, he continued his habit of sleeping with men.
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>All the years that I was there, I continued with this habit of sleeping with men.
    <br>Until I met a lady called Mary who asked me, "When are you going to stop doing this?"
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>He said that he engaged in this for almost 15 years until he met one lady called Mary.
    <br>This lady asked him how long he would continue doing this.
    <br>Before you get to that area, brother, can you just explain to us what your lifestyle was like
    <br>during this period, after that spirit of man had entered you, right from the age of 10.
    <br>What were the type of things you found yourself doing that you know were not ordinary for you to do as a man?
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>I used to use expensive creams and apply different make-up, including lip gloss.
    <br>I used to apply eyeliner and thicken my eyebrows.
    <br>Whenever I entered a place, I would catwalk and act seductively, like a lady or a model.
    <br>He said that he used to put cream on his face, bleach himself and put lipstick on.
    <br>Even when he was walking, he would walk like a lady - wherever he was.
    <br>You would think that a lady is sitting there - not a man.
    <br>He would catwalk in front of people as if he was a lady.
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>I continued acting like a lady until I reached a point where I could no longer understand myself.
    <br>I was not attracted to women at all.
    <br>He said that he continued being like a lady, wearing tight clothes.
    <br>At the end of the day, he didn't love women anymore; he was just forcing himself on men.
    <br>I became infamous and started going from one region to another to sleep with men.
    <br>I was moving around every corner from Dar es Salaam, to Mwanza, to Arusha,
    <br>sleeping with all kinds of men.
    <br>He said that he started going from one region to another.
    <br>He now started developing the habit of sleeping with big men.
    <br>He used to sleep with men who are working in the government. People who have honours.
    <br>He continued developing this to such an extent that he became like a professional in what he was doing.
    <br>OK. You said initially at the age of 10, you began seeing yourself in the dream as a woman.
    <br>Can you just explain more about those dreams that you were having right from that initial time
    <br>when a man raped you at the age of 10.
    <br>How did these dreams continue?
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>I used to dream of being a very beautiful lady; there was no woman as beautiful as me.
    <br>He said that he used to see himself as the most beautiful, unimaginably gorgeous lady in his dreams.
    <br>Whenever he saw himself, he had this unimaginable beauty.
    <br>As I continued to have such dreams, I continued to sleep with men.
    <br>Whenever I went somewhere and was approached by poor or low class men,
    <br>I would reject them because I considered myself a high-class lady as I appeared in my dreams.
    <br>He said that the more he dreamt of being this lady, the deeper he got into doing these actions.
    <br>He even saw himself as a queen - a very honourable queen.
    <br>When poor men approached him to sleep with him,
    <br>he had no interest in them because he felt he was worthy of sleeping with big men
    <br>as he used to see himself as a big queen in his dreams.
    <br>So, we can understand exactly what the man of God said when he said spirit of man,
    <br>and how this evil spirit entered our brother right from that tender age of 10 years old.
    <br>Tell us, how did you find yourself to be here in The SCOAN?
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>The lady, Mary, asked me why I was doing what was not pleasing to God.
    <br>She advised me to change, that I should tune to a station called Emmanuel TV
    <br>and even to leave it on while I slept through the night.
    <br>He said that he met with one lady called Mary.
    <br>This lady told him, "Why are you doing these abominable acts? 
    <br>You should change your habit and be in a masculine way - the way God created you".
    <br>The lady advised him to start watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>He got a decoder and put on the channel so he could start watching it.
    <br>Can you describe for us again, what happened in the service, what was going through your mind
    <br>at that moment when it was the time of prophecy?
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>I was disturbed in my heart and I would sit down whenever Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed.
    <br>He prayed for other people and when he moved away from me, my heart felt very happy.
    <br>He said that when the man of God was on the pulpit, whenever he was praying or doing prophecy,
    <br>his charisma was very low. He never felt interested. He would just sit down.
    <br>Whenever the man of God would leave the pulpit and go out for a moment,
    <br>his spirit would be very happy.
    <br>But immediately the man of God came back, that's when he would start feeling agitated
    <br>and very uninterested in the service. He would just be sitting down.
    <br>When he came back the second time, that was when the spirit strangled me.
    <br>When the Prophet prayed and turned to my direction, that was when the arrow struck me.
    <br>He said that immediately the man of God pointed out his case and faced him,
    <br>the situation got even worse.
    <br>He had the feeling of being strangled, something was poking him and there was a very big battle.
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>Later, the Prophet said, "You", and I ducked down on my chair to hide.
    <br>He repeated the prophecy and I hid again.
    <br>I told my neighbour that the Prophet was talking to him but insisted that it was for me.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua beckoned me to come and I found myself moving towards him.
    <br>The spirit continued to strangle and torment me as if it wanted to take my life.
    <br>He said that the thing which was hooking him - it was so serious to such an extent that he felt as if
    <br>his life was coming to an end.
    <br>Immediately the man of God started talking to him, he felt like hiding
    <br>and told his neighbour, "The man of God is speaking to you; he is not speaking to me".
    <br>He was tapping his neighbour that the prophecy which the man of God was giving was not referring to him.
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>Since the time he prayed for me, I have been well. I am free.
    <br>He said that immediately the man of God talked to him and prayed for him, he now feels very free.
    <br>That urge is gone, and he feels like a normal healthy human being.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mr Patrick James (Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>We just want to be clear, brother.
    <br>Ever since the prophecy last week and the prayer you received in the the name of Jesus Christ, 
    <br>how has your life changed?
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>Now, I have changed a lot. I even have affection for ladies.
    <br>Previously, I was not like that but now, I don't like men anymore; I just see them as my friends.
    <br>He said that his life has changed dramatically.
    <br>He doesn't have the urge for men anymore.
    <br>He even has affection for women now.
    <br>Whenever he is around men, he just feels like being with friends
    <br>with whom he can share words of advice and the like.
    <br>He no longer has the urge for men.
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>When I sleep, I no longer dream those dreams I used to have.
    <br>Now, I dream things pertaining to God and if I have any fear, I pray with Psalm 51.
    <br>He said that his dreams have totally changed.
    <br>He doesn't see himself doing all these strange things he was doing in the past.
    <br>He just dreams of things that pertain to God.
    <br>His desire to read the Bible has grown stronger.
    <br>Whenever he faces a challenge, his heart will just point him to go and read the Bible.
    <br>He loves to read and pray with the psalm of repentance - Psalm 51, whenever he faces any challenge.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is truly the evidence that the spirit of man has completely left our brother's life,
    <br>after the word of prophecy and deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Brother, what is your advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>This problem is very bad and I advise my fellows that it is possible to stop.
    <br>They should depend on God and involve Him in every matter and they will succeed as I have.
    <br>He said that what he was doing was very bad.
    <br>He is advising his fellows that this thing is possible to abort and to leave it. It is possible to be delivered.
    <br>They should just look onto God. At the end of the day, God will transform their lives
    <br>and give them a new hope, a new life in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, only God Almighty could bring about such a transformation and we give all glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Brother, just describe to us: as the man of God gave that prophecy
    <br>and we saw you come forward, holding your neck, what was happening at that moment?
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>That spirit was strangling me as if it wanted to kill me.
    <br>When I wanted to move towards the Prophet, it would pull me back or in a different direction.
    <br>He said that the moment the man of God pointed to him,
    <br>something very strong hooked him by the throat and poked him in the chest.
    <br>When he moved towards the man of God, immediately the thing got stronger
    <br>and was pulling him back; it didn't want him to go towards that direction.
    <br>He felt like his life was just going to end; he was going to die.
    <br>This is indeed the power of God that exposed the evil spirits in the life of our brother - the spirit of man -
    <br>and sent it out.
    <br>Today, by the grace of God, we have heard it from our brother that
    <br>since last week, he has been living a free life, a normal life.
    <br>He has no affection or urge for his fellow men.
    <br>Indeed, he said he now has affection for females as it is intended by God Almighty.
    <br>We give all the glory to God for his wonderful deliverance in Jesus' name.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mr Patrick James 
    <br>(Prophecy Testimony)
    <br>We just want to use this opportunity as well to use the case of our brother as an advice to the world.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, always says
    <br>that as Christians we must know that we must love sinners but hate sin.
    <br>That is, we should hate the act but not the person.
    <br>Because if you don't love people, if you don't love someone like our brother,
    <br>how will we be actually able to help them?
    <br>You cannot help people that you hate.
    <br>In fact, it is only through love that we can help because there is no love through hatred.
    <br>It is genuine help that can bring about love.
    <br>If someone like Prophet T.B. Joshua did not show love, he would not be able to help people like our brother here.
    <br>He came all the way from Tanzania here to Nigeria.
    <br>If he, Prophet T.B. Joshua, did not take care of this brother, did not accommodate him,
    <br>did not feed him, then he would not be in the position to help him
    <br>as we are seeing him sharing his testimony right now.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, know that hate cannot help anyone.
    <br>It is love that can help.
    <br>This is why Jesus Christ gave the instruction, "Love your neighbour as yourself".
    <br>Our Lord Jesus Christ also further stated that the sun reigns on both the righteous and the unrighteousness.
    <br>The meaning of this is that if you only love those that love you, of what benefit is it to you?
    <br>The purpose that our Lord Jesus Christ came into this world was to love.
    <br>Even those who hate you - love all; not just those who love you.
    <br>Therefore, it is by loving those who hate you that you love our Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>and demonstrate His love in the world.
    <br>So, once again, this is a case example that we believe - it serves as a lesson to our viewers all over the world.
    <br> Let us love the sinner but hate the sin.
    <br>That is, hate the act, not the person.
    <br>We thank Jesus Christ that right now our brother is free and when the Son of God sets you free,
    <br>you are free indeed.
    <br>One more time, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
