  <p>    
    <br>During the service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua sent the evangelists to minister the Morning Water in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Setting people aside for God's special attention.
    <br>As the Morning Water was ministered to this young lady, she began to react violently.
    <br>The evil spirits inside her began to manifest
    <br>as the fire of the Holy Ghost causes these evil spirits to cry out.
    <br>Let us hear what they have to say.
    <br>All over your body, Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>You wicked evil spirit, all over your body, Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Who are you? Stop that nonsense.
    <br>How have you destroyed her, you demon?
    <br>I took away her hair.
    <br>You did what to her hair?
    <br>I took her hair away.
    <br>What else have you done to her health and her body? What else have you done?
    <br>She's always sick, so she can't go to school.
    <br>I made her bleed through all her openings, and she can menstruate for 33 days.
    <br>You said you made her bleed. Where does she bleed from?
    <br>Her eyes.
    <br>You made her bleed from her eyes?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Why did you do that, you demon?
    <br>Because I don't want her to watch that.
    <br>You don't want her to watch what?
    <br>Your TV.
    <br>Which TV?
    <br>That one.
    <br>Which TV do you mean?
    <br>That one - Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Every time she wants to read her Bible, she gets a headache so she can't read it.
    <br>So, any time she wants to read her Bible, you demon make her bleed through her eyes?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She lays her hands on the TV and prays with that man.
    <br>Which man?
    <br>Your father.
    <br>The pictures we are seeing here - is this how you make her bleed through her eyes?
    <br>I already know; I am the one who caused it.
    <br>You are always doing this to me; you are going all over the world
    <br>to deliver people and it's not going to work.
    <br>Listen, what makes you to cause her to bleed through her eyes? Why?
    <br>Because she wants to read her Bible.
    <br>Ok, because she wants to read her Bible.
    <br>She's always reading Isaiah 11:2 and telling herself that God will comfort her.
    <br>What happens to her in school?
    <br>She's never studied from the first time she started
    <br>until today but she's always getting high marks.
    <br>Then, I made her see funny creatures and the words she is reading fly off the page.
    <br>You make her to see funny creatures in her school so that she cannot study and concentrate?
    <br>They torment her; people call her crazy but she's very intelligent.
    <br>I don't want her to work for your God, so I send her people who are perverts
    <br>and they expose themselves to her and some even rape her.
    <br>I don't want her to serve God; I don't want her to do anything good.
    <br>What have you done to her family?
    <br>Her mum got sacked from the first job she liked because she was going to pay for her school fees.
    <br>Then she got sacked and lost her job, so the sister has to work so she can look after her
    <br>and the whole family because her mum is always praying and exhausted from praying too much.
    <br>Who is this lady standing beside you? Who is she? Look here!
    <br>I know who she is - the one who took her here. They struggled all the way from the airport to here.
    <br>Who is this young lady to you?
    <br>She's my daughter, sir.
    <br>At the age of eight, she was raped, and she didn't tell any of us.
    <br>She didn't even tell me - her mother.
    <br>Then, at the age of twelve, we started to see this blood coming out.
    <br>Where was the blood coming out from?
    <br>It was coming out from her eyes.
    <br>Then it would come out from her nose. It would fill like a coffee mug - every time it drops down.
    <br>Then, we knew the next thing that would happen is that she wouldn't be able to see
    <br>any word in her school books.
    <br>The next thing is that the school would ask us to remove her from the school.
    <br>Three different schools.
    <br>So right now, we have put her completely off school because no school wants to accept her.
    <br>All the doctors everywhere saw nothing.
    <br>They said there is nothing wrong with her eyes. They saw nothing, and they couldn't help.
    <br>They didn't have a remedy for this.
    <br>So, it is beyond medical comprehension that someone could bleed through their eyes?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>No doctor could diagnose her with anything. Even the university ... nowhere ... everywhere we took her to.
    <br>And the demon also said he took her hair. What can you say about this?
    <br>The hair just started to fall off because she was saying, I am stressed, I want to go back to school.
    <br>Then, we tried to give her a book to read, and she said there is nothing in the book.
    <br>Then, the hair started to fall off. It left patches.
    <br>So, you can't even do anything. Then, she took her scissors herself and cut it all off.
    <br>What is the name that people call her in the community because of this stigma of her eyes bleeding?
    <br>They say that I am the one who is a witch. That I am teaching here these things.
    <br>We have lived a life of prayer - completely in prayer.
    <br>So, people are accusing you and the whole family because of that?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They chase her out saying that she is going to spread the demon of witchcraft in the schools.
    <br>Now, it is time for her to receive her deliverance.
    <br>You demon, how did you enter into this body? How did you enter her?
    <br>I entered through a lot of things - people were jealous because she was intelligent.
    <br>Somebody stole her school shoes and books.
    <br>Everybody just comes and steals things from the family because the family is so rich.
    <br>Some of the things, they don't notice.
    <br>They go and take their pictures to put under the water and on trees,
    <br>strap them and declare they will take their riches - and now, they are very poor.
    <br>They used their last money to come to this side.
    <br>Once again, who are you in this body?
    <br>We are many.
    <br>Who are you? What is your name?
    <br>I am the spirit of death.
    <br>Spirit of death?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Right now, you wicked demon, it is your time to leave this body and everything you have planted within her.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, get out of her right now!
    <br>You must go! Get out of her, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your back on the floor!
    <br>You must go, in Jesus' mighty name!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You demon, everything you have planted in her - vomit it out!
    <br>Get out right now! Anything you have planted in her body - you must get out!
    <br>Anything behind this bleeding - get out! Vomit it in Jesus' name!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Rise up, sister! You are free through the Morning Water in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Rise up, right now! You are free in Jesus' name.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Congratulations! You are delivered in Jesus' name through the Morning Water.
    <br>Who is she to you? Who is this lady to you?
    <br>She is my mum.
    <br>Madam, your daughter is free.
    <br>The spirit that caused her to bleed through her eyes and took her hair is out
    <br>and she is free in Jesus' name. Never remind her of her past. She is free.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Hope. I'm from South Africa.
    <br>The people standing beside me are my mum and my best friend - my sister.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I started bleeding
    <br>from all the openings in my body which included my eyes, nose, mouth and ears,
    <br>as well as on my arms - sometimes, my pores would open
    <br>and I would start bleeding in random places at random times.
    <br>It started in 2011. I was going through a phase of depression.
    <br>I came back from school one day and started having a series of bad dreams.
    <br>Every time I came back from school, in the afternoons I would take an afternoon nap.
    <br>I would fall asleep, and I would have terrible nightmares
    <br>where I would dream that people tried to break me apart.
    <br>Some people would sleep with me but in a very vigorous way.
    <br>I would dream of irregular shapes, people with eight arms or six eyes
    <br>that would be running after me.
    <br>It just went on and eventually, I started to see these things.
    <br>I couldn't sleep and fell into depression.
    <br>Whenever I was sleeping, I also started sweating excessively.
    <br>After that happened, my eyes would swell.
    <br>The first time it happened, it was on my right eye.
    <br>I just started bleeding.
    <br>I woke up, and my pillow was red. I didn't know what had happened or where it came from.
    <br>I am not a person who tells everybody everything, so I kept it to myself.
    <br>It happened again in 2013 on both of my eyes, and my aunt was there.
    <br>She saw it happening because immediately it happened,
    <br>I removed the pillow case from the pillow and went to the washing machine to try to wash it off
    <br>before someone else could see it.
    <br>My aunt stopped me and asked me, "What is all this?"
    <br>I started crying and told her everything.
    <br>Every time I cried, I would cry blood and she saw it.
    <br>so, I begged and pleaded with her not to tell my mum because I didn't want to scare or worry her.
    <br>In 2015, it would happen every six to eight weeks.
    <br>It started from June, July and it just continued.
    <br>At that time, it was coming out of my nose, eyes and ears.
    <br>I started getting more and more depressed.
    <br>I took a picture of it, and I kept my phone under my pillow, hoping nobody would see it.
    <br>My sister woke up one morning and wanted to borrow my phone, and she saw the pictures
    <br>and told my mum.
    <br>I then confessed everything and cried. I was in a very miserable situation.
    <br>Eventually, a whole lot of things, terrible things, happened after that.
    <br>I started to menstruate for about 40 days.
    <br>I'd skip for like two days and then, I would menstruate for another 40 days.
    <br>It would just go on.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ. We can see that she is overwhelmed by the emotions of joy
    <br>because she knows that this is now her past.
    <br>When she came to The SCOAN, Jesus Christ set her free
    <br>from these terrible, excruciating conditions.
    <br>She explained that any time she would sleep, she would have terrible nightmares.
    <br>Different kinds of creatures would try to kill her or tear her apart.
    <br>When she woke up from those dreams, she would find herself crying blood - physically.
    <br>As she woke up with these conditions, it started affecting her life
    <br>with different kinds of problems.
    <br>Her menstruation became irregular.
    <br>In fact, it was so much that she could even menstruate for 40 days in a row.
    <br>This definitely had many different kinds of physical consequences in her body.
    <br>Can you just tell us how this problem affected you physically, spiritually, emotionally
    <br>and socially - more than anything else.
    <br>Every time I wanted to go to school, it would happen. It would happen about six times.
    <br>I told one of my friends who saw it happen in the toilet, to excuse me from class that day.
    <br>It happened again when I was in class. People were running away from me.
    <br>They started calling me a devil's child. They said I was evil.
    <br>Some people thought that the condition I had was contagious.
    <br>It affected me so much that I was eventually kicked out from the school.
    <br>I couldn't continue anymore.
    <br>We have listened to the life experiences of our sister.
    <br>She is so young, yet she has experienced so much pain and trouble from the evil one
    <br>and we give glory to God Almighty that today she is here and her life has been transformed.
    <br>So, during the clip we just watched, we saw the demon that caused these eyes to bleed
    <br>and all these different conditions in your life.
    <br>Can you just explain more about that?
    <br>It caused a lot of depression and fatigue. I couldn't sleep.
    <br>I would only sleep for like two hours.
    <br>Every time I read my Bible, these tears of blood would just start dripping on my Bible.
    <br>I would just close my Bible quickly.
    <br>Eventually, I started reading my Bible upright.
    <br>Because I was not sleeping or eating, I was just thinking about what was going on with me,
    <br>I started to hate myself.
    <br>I contemplated on suicide.
    <br>I hated to see my family watch me suffer.
    <br>I hated to make them suffer so I thought the best way to get rid of this problem
    <br>was to commit suicide.
    <br>Times without number, my mum stopped me.
    <br>I tried to hang myself but my mum walked in on me.
    <br>I took painkillers.
    <br>One pill was supposed to make you sleep for six hours.
    <br>I took about 14 of those.
    <br>Immediately, my mum made me to drink plenty of water.
    <br>She started praying, and I believe it was only God who saved me.
    <br>I also lost my hair.
    <br>It started falling off.
    <br>What happened was that it fell off on this side.
    <br>Every time I combed, it looked as if I was going through chemotherapy or something like that.
    <br>I hid all the pieces of my hair under my cupboard.
    <br>Some of it, I cut it.
    <br>I told my mum that I was styling it but I knew what was going on.
    <br>Eventually, as my hair fell off, my mum told me,
    <br>"Something is really wrong; you need to tell me the truth".
    <br>She found out that my hair had started falling off because she could see it on my shoulders.
    <br>It affected me spiritually because every time I wanted to read my Bible, I couldn't read.
    <br>Mentally, I was not thinking.
    <br>I stopped thinking and started thinking about one thing - nightmares.
    <br>Physically, I lost weight and became pale.
    <br>The demon also caused me to be molested by people I did not know.
    <br>When I was eight years old and was giong to school, this man followed me.
    <br>He raped me but I don't remember much of that.
    <br>In 2012 again, I had a friend and we were together and he offered me cookies.
    <br>I didn't know what was in them. I thought he was my friend, so I ate them.
    <br>Immediately, I fell asleep and realised that he actually raped me.
    <br>He took me home and lied to my aunt that something had happened to me
    <br>and he found me.
    <br>Again last year, I was walking to school, and I was raped again.
    <br>I didn't confess or say anything; I went home and cried.
    <br>The situation was just severe - it was too much.
    <br>That is also one of the things that led me to wanting to commit suicide.
    <br>We have got an understanding now of the kind of condition that actually brought you to The SCOAN.
    <br>I think that everyone of us can feel the same pain she has experienced as well during her life.
    <br>Can you just tell us how you finally ended up in The SCOAN
    <br>and what happened when you came?
    <br>Before we came to The SCOAN, we were basically on our way to poverty.
    <br>We were spending so much money on my medical bills.
    <br>My mum sold our fridge, couch and beds for accommodation and transport to The SCOAN.
    <br>When we came, we came with faith.
    <br>I was looking for God at that time. I was looking for a proper relationship with Jesus.
    <br>I was tired of going to other churches and being prayed for over and over again
    <br>and not receiving help.
    <br>I was tired of being rejected.
    <br>With the little money that we had and gathered, we came to The SCOAN and I was delivered.
    <br>Exactly what I was looking for, I found which was a perfect relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.
    <br>If you know that this is the God that we serve, put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Miss Hope & Family 
    <br>(Deliverance Testimony)
    <br>That was how you received your deliverance at The SCOAN.
    <br>Can you now tell us what we are all eager to hear:
    <br>We understand that your deliverance happened a couple of months ago.
    <br>Can you tell us: After your deliverance, how has your life turned around.
    <br>Start with the physical aspect; then, spiritually, emotionally and socially.
    <br>Physically, I have received so much rest in my spirit, soul and body.
    <br>Spiritually, physically and mentally, I am just so revived.
    <br>I am on fire for Jesus.
    <br>What happened to me, I thank God that it happened because it has brought up a new me.
    <br>Miss Hope & Family 
    <br>(Deliverance Testimony)
    <br>I am speechless because I didn't think my life would be where it is today.
    <br>We regained everything in double portion.
    <br>Pertaining to my health, it is twice as good.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Miss Hope & Family 
    <br>(Deliverance Testimony)
    <br>So, many people are sitting down. They want to understand.
    <br>Do you mean that now after your deliverance - what happened to the bleeding eyes,
    <br>the nightmares, the hair falling off and so on.
    <br>Are you still experiencing these kind of things?
    <br>My eyes have stopped bleeding.
    <br>I was just crying two minutes ago and my eyes are crystal clear.
    <br>I am a happy child.
    <br>Whenever I cry, I look at my tears and say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>It means the world to me.
    <br>Whenever I am blowing my nose, I look at my snot and say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>When I cough and I want to cough out mucus or phlegm,
    <br>I cough it out and say, "Thank You, Jesus - it is crystal clear!"
    <br>In terms of my health, I am back to the way things were.
    <br>This is my hair before it fell off.
    <br>This is when I was going through the trial and whatever I was going through.
    <br>As time progressed, my hair has actually come out much thicker and healthier.
    <br>The people who are doing my hair in the salon are always telling me that my hair is too great.
    <br>I thank Jesus for that.
    <br>This is a recent picture of what my hair looks like.
    <br>My deliverance was exactly last year around this time
    <br>which means this is truly a miracle.
    <br>God has just done it for me. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Miss Hope & Family 
    <br>(Deliverance Testimony)
    <br>In terms of my menstruation, everything is back to normal.
    <br>I menstruate from three to four days
    <br>whereas before, I could menstruate for thirty or forty days straight.
    <br>This is actually the first year that I have not experienced any form of perversion in my life.
    <br>No one has tried to sexually harass me in any form or manner.
    <br>From the time I was eight up until last year,
    <br>I would come across people who had urges to do things to me.
    <br>Glory to God, this year has come and gone and there is nothing whatsoever like that.
    <br>Miss Hope & Family 
    <br>(Deliverance Testimony)
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Thuli from South Africa.
    <br>I am really grateful to God to be standing in your midst, sharing this testimony.
    <br>As a mother, parent, it was very painful - inexplicably painful.
    <br>I can't compare it to anything.
    <br>I really can't match it to any other pain.
    <br>I would live a prayer life and we all think that once we pray, things are going to be okay
    <br>or we will understand what is going on but in her case, I myself didn't understand it.
    <br>Strangely, when things happened, she wouldn't even mention it to me,
    <br>knowing that I am a caring mother.
    <br>Despite of all that, I just continued with prayer.
    <br>I said, "God has promised not to leave me, nor forsake me".
    <br>Do you now testify to what your daughter has said that this condition is over,
    <br>she is healed and everything is restored back to normal now? Is that correct?
    <br>Yes, she is complete; she is healed.
    <br>She is doing a hundred times better.
    <br>The report from the school came back to prove that she is back, getting 90 percent all the time.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Faith.
    <br>I would like to thank God for my sister's life today.
    <br>I thank Jesus Christ for this ministry because it has brought restoration to our lives.
    <br>Being the closest to my sister, this challenged our family.
    <br>I was one of the first people to find out about her condition.
    <br>Trying to get through each phase and stage, it affected us totally -
    <br>the whole family crumbled to try to get through to her deliverance.
    <br>I confirm everything she said.
    <br>I thank God because there is so much peace in her life.
    <br>She has focus now and more importantly, there is progress.
    <br>She can now expect a better future within herself for Christ.
    <br>Miss Hope & Family 
    <br>(Deliverance Testimony)
    <br>Finally now, my sister, there are many young people out there that are listening to you right now.
    <br>They may be passing through depression, thoughts of ending their own lives, similar conditions
    <br>or other conditions that are also very tough to bear.
    <br>Can you just give a word of advice to them right now?
    <br>To viewers all over the world, young people,
    <br>cast your cares on Jesus because He cares for you.
    <br>No matter your situation, God still has something to say.
    <br>Your situation may be as bad as mine or worse or not so bad -
    <br>whatever you do, make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and you will come back with your testimony.
    <br>Just believe in God; believe in Jesus; believe He can do it for you.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Finally, we want to encourage you now that you have this wonderful testimony in your life,
    <br>make sure you stay close to Jesus Christ and make His Word the standard for your own life
    <br>so that these wonderful testimonies and breakthroughs you have been experiencing will continue and last
    <br>and be multiplied in your life, in Jesus' name.
