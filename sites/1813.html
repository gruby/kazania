    <br>Standard For Life
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature 
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>Mr. Oluwa Gbenga's body has been ravaged by deadly poison, making him barely recognizable.
    <br>His distraught family members fan his body in an attempt to lessen the unbearable heat
    <br>radiating from the skin.
    <br>He's unable to do anything as every part of his body has been eaten away by the deadly poison.
    <br>His skin has turned purple and begins to peel away.
    <br>A closer look reveals that even his manhood has been eaten away by the poison making it hardly recognizable.
    <br>Imagine the intense shame and pain that makes up his daily existence.
    <br>Mr. Oluwa Gbenga is like a dead man living but thank You, Jesus Christ,
    <br>our situation may point us to death but God's Word points us to life.
    <br>Let's watch to see how God uses his servant Prophet T.B Joshua to bring life to his body.
    <br>Healing Time
    <br>In the name of Jesus, I want to bath him with the blood of Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus,
    <br>I wash away disease in the blood, in the fluid, in the tendons, on the skin, on the body.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>That is the end.
    <br>At the command of Jesus Christ, his body was washed with the blood of Jesus
    <br>and the curse of sickness instantly leaves his body.
    <br>The SCOAN Deliverance And Healing Service
    <br>In his own words, "I can no longer feel that unbearable heat. I am now all right."
    <br>When Jesus heals, He heals effectually.
    <br>To the glory of God, just four days later, Mr. Oluwa Gbenga came back to testify
    <br>that his skin had been completely restored.
    <br>The miracle Worker is still alive. His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Deliverance And Healing Service
    <br>After his miraculous healing, Mr. Gbenga Ogini lived and walked in the light of his testimony.
    <br>Twenty-two years later, he came back to the Synagogue, Church of All Nations with his family
    <br>to further thank God for restoring his life.
    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>My name is Gbenga Ogini.
    <br>The people beside me are my firstborn, thirdborn and lastborn, and the last person is my sister.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN 22 years ago is the problem of body poisoning.
    <br>I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't do anything.
    <br>Inside my stomach, it would be like they put hot water.
    <br>It started burning me, I couldn't do anything about it.
    <br>I put two fans in my room but the two fans couldn't sustain me.
    <br>I could not put on any clothes. They could not hold me.
    <br>If I tried putting on clothes, my flesh would peel away with the clothes.
    <br>When I decided to come to The SCOAN, they decided to give me that boxer to wear.
    <br>I used cotton wool to cover my private parts and the rest of my body.
    <br>If I wanted to put on anything, I put on cotton wool.
    <br>If I wanted to go to the toilet, I had to use cotton wool to cover my body.
    <br>The sickness was very serious unless I stayed indoors. I could not go outside.
    <br>I could not sit on my own unless I stood.
    <br>Sometimes if I wanted to rest, I had to put my head on top of the table.
    <br>I could not eat, I could not do anything. I could not bath. I could not even go anywhere.
    <br>If I sat outside in the sun, it would be as if the sun turned to fire.
    <br>I went to the hospital and I saw everybody starting to cover their noses.
    <br>When the doctors wanted to attend to me, they had to cover their noses.
    <br>Later, they used one language, Yoruba language and said this person should be carried away.
    <br>They carried me elsewhere because they didn't want me inside the hospital.
    <br>I now called my family and said,
    <br>"Do you see this sickness? I cannot eat now. My inside is boiling. Outside, the breeze is like fire.
    <br>Just find anything for me. Anything, let me just take it. I'm dying."
    <br>When I said this, my sister called the whole village, she called everybody.
    <br>Everyone started to come around, they started to take me from one herbalist to another.
    <br>In some places, when they took me to a herbalist, they would pursue us and say:
    <br>"Don't bother with this one, he is finished. He doesn't eat, he is finished.
    <br>You should never come here and spoil our work for us. Carry it away."
    <br>They pursued us.
    <br>Then I met one of my sisters' friend, he said, "Do you see the problem that your brother has?
    <br>If he does not mind, we can get him to one place where there is a church."
    <br>I have not even heard of the Synagogue. At that time there was no Emmanuel TV. I didn't know anything.
    <br>The man contacted my sister, "Let's carry the man to this pastor.
    <br>He is the only one who can deliver this man from this kind of problem he has."
    <br>At the time when they brought me here, I couldn't hear, I couldn't see.
    <br>I didn't know that I was in the midst of people. I just thought it was a normal thing.
    <br>I thought they took to a good native doctor.
    <br>The only thing that I heard was when he said, "In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>It was our pastor, senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I just heard him saying: "In the name of Jesus, in the mighty name of Jesus, be healed!"
    <br>It was as if they put a big block all over my body.
    <br>It started to come down like that - come down and fall down.
    <br>Put your hands together louder for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Healed Of Body Poison
    <br>After I felt the quick sensation, I opened my eyes and I saw many people.
    <br>I didn't know what to do. What happened?
    <br>I then heard the man of God, I looked and saw the man of God.
    <br>I then heard the man of God saying, "Do you see this, the man does not know himself."
    <br>He said they should ask me. "How is your body? How is your head now?"
    <br>I then told the man of God, "I am okay. I'm cool."
    <br>Since that time when the man of God prayed for me, I only see all these black spots on my body.
    <br>The pain was gone. Everything both inside and outside was gone.
    <br>And what has happened in your life ever since that and what are the things you've been able to achieve?
    <br>I just see the hand of God in my life, everything that I laid my hand on, started to turn around.
    <br>So, if you see my son now, he is 20 years old.
    <br>The advice that I give to people when I look around me -
    <br>if God heals you, please, learn how to maintain your healing.
    <br>So, I thank God for healing me.
    <br>I met with the man of God and the man of God counselled me.
    <br>I did not know God before I had this sickness. I did not know anyone who was called God.
    <br>So when I came to the Synagogue, they preached the Gospel of God to me. I did not know about God.
    <br>Since that time, I decided to follow the way and the teaching of Senior Prophet T.B Joshua.
    <br>And everything about me started to turn around.
    <br>Christiana Ogini
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>When I was told that my younger brother was sick and I went there to see him,
    <br>it was as if hot water was poured on his head and his whole body was damaged.
    <br>Right now, what can you say after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>He is okay; he has recovered! I thank God Almighty.
    <br>My advice to the viewers is whatever happens to one in this world,
    <br>one should have faith that there is no problem God cannot solve and there is no sickness God cannot cure.
    <br>So, we want to advise you, brother, as God Almighty has set you free through his Word,
    <br>make sure you continue to follow Him along the way and make His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>As you do that, God will continue to give you the grace to stay far from sin and be close to Him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
