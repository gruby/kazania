    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>There is a brother - you have a charm in your pocket.
    <br>If you come here and you go back,
    <br>there is a charm you are carrying inside your pocket.
    <br>When I am saying it now, you check your pocket and see it. 
    <br>It is in your pocket; you are using it.
    <br>You know what you are doing here is quite different from what you are carrying.
    <br>This is not the right place.
    <br>Please, can you come out?
    <br>Not out of respect for me but respect for God.
    <br>If you don't come out, you disrespect God.
    <br>Please, come out.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>This man comes out to confirm the words of prophecy given by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>My name is Abraham Oghenekewe, from Abuja.
    <br>The person beside me is my wife.
    <br>I'm the one that the man of God prophesied about last week;
    <br>that there's a man there holding a charm in his pocket.
    <br>I confirm it to be very true.
    <br>The charm is for protection.
    <br>When I traveled home to Delta state,
    <br>one of my friends took me to a witchdoctor.
    <br>He told me that the witchdoctor would give me a charm that would give me a job; I am a contrator
    <br>He said, "Nobody will harm you with this charm."
    <br>The witchdoctor brought the charm out and he wanted to give me the rules and regulations of the charm.
    <br>Rule one - my wife must not see the charm.
    <br>When I want to meet my wife, I should not touch that charm
    <br>and I should hide it very well.
    <br>And anytime I lose the charm, I should immediately go back home,
    <br>to do another ritual and get another charm.
    <br>And rain must not touch that charm, that is the rule.
    <br>I took the charm home thinking that before 2 or 3 months, things would start happening.
    <br>My brothers and sisters, sickness entered the family.
    <br>No business.
    <br>No contracts anywhere.
    <br>The second time I'd shown my wife, the leg began swelling.
    <br>What is happening?
    <br>My daughter got sick, I myself was sick.
    <br>I couldn't stand up.
    <br>I then called the witchdoctor and told him that I'm not okay.
    <br>He said, "It's a small thing, just come home and we'll do everything for you."
    <br>I told my wife but she didn't believe that witchdoctor.
    <br>I then traveled home and the man said I must bring a goat.
    <br>I must also give him 40 000 to get anything I want.
    <br>I didn't have a job and there was no money coming in from anywhere.
    <br>Do you mean the reason why you went to the spiritualist to get this charm was for you to be prosperous?
    <br>You were looking for success?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And what now happened?
    <br>Did success now come to the house?
    <br>Nothing came, no success,
    <br>no blessing, no work.
    <br>Hardship everywhere.
    <br>Nothing is happening.
    <br>Sometimes I used a razor blade to shave my head to tell you how harsh it is.
    <br>Razor blades, I would sit and my wife would shave me.
    <br>And I thought to myself, what is this?
    <br>After the sacrifice, I came back home.
    <br>In two weeks' time, I saw the leg starting to swell again.
    <br>Even in Gwarinpa Hospital in Abuja, they know my wife very well.
    <br>We have become like customers there.
    <br>Every week she can't stand without drugs.
    <br>And myself, I cannot bend because of the sickness.
    <br>Every night I'd call my wife and ask her to help with my back because I felt pain every night.
    <br>And I found out that once I put the charm in my pocket, I feel like there are 30 blocks on top of my head.
    <br>It is very heavy, it is not easy.
    <br>To put it in my pocket it is like I put 70 blocks in my pocket.
    <br>I cannot raise my leg anymore.
    <br>There was a good day, I went to my friend's house.
    <br>I saw him watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was concentrating on Emmanuel TV and asked if this is happening in Nigeria.
    <br>He said, Yes.
    <br>I then bought a decoder.
    <br>In my mind, I was thinking that I must come to this place.
    <br>This is where I should go; by then, I had gone to many prayer houses.
    <br>Some would say, 'Go and bring this, we'll pray for you.
    <br>Go and buy a sponge, go and buy this and we'll pray for you.'
    <br>Nothing is happening until this day.
    <br>I'm coming here. I must come to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>The funny thing is that the minute I decided I'd be coming here,
    <br>or if I mentioned coming here,
    <br>whenever I saved 5 000, before I turn the money would disappear.
    <br>Until the day I didn't tell anyone I'd be coming here, I kept it to myself.
    <br>When the money entered, I said to my wife, "Let us go!"
    <br>She asked, "Do you have transport?"
    <br>"I have transport - even if I reach there and do not have transport, I'll look for a job there."
    <br>She said, "Okay."
    <br>So when we found ourselves here in Lagos,
    <br>I told my wife that I'm not going back home with this charm.
    <br>She said, "How?"
    <br>I said this charm would not enter my house again.
    <br>When we were coming to church, I removed the charm.
    <br>My wife said I shouldn't touch it and I shouldn't bring it into the church.
    <br>The security are already at the gate, they will search you.
    <br>I said to her, "Don't worry I'm going into church with it."
    <br>I removed it from the bag and put it in my pocket.
    <br>At the first gate, they searched me and they did not see anything.
    <br>At the second gate, they searched me and they did not see anything.
    <br>When I entered, I sat down and then asked my wife to touch my pocket.
    <br>"Do you see anything? That thing is in my pocket."
    <br>She said, "Wow! How did you pass?"
    <br>But I was praying, saying, "God locate me today.
    <br>I'm not going home with this bondage."
    <br>That was my prayer.
    <br>God did it for me.
    <br>I was just standing there and the man of God prophesied 
    <br>that there's a man with a magic charm in his pocket.
    <br>When he mentioned the case, I felt a sudden drop in my balance,
    <br>like a big chain had just been disconnected.
    <br>I felt free immediately and that's when I tapped my wife.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>I then told my wife that I felt free and that I could stand.
    <br>I stretched my back and then walked out to confirm the prophecy.
    <br>Ever since then, I feel like a newborn baby.
    <br>I can sleep well.
    <br>Do you see my wife here?
    <br>Check her legs, they are no longer swollen.
    <br>I am feeling okay.
    <br>We can sleep very well.
    <br>And then I called my daughter.
    <br>My daughter was very sick before I came here.
    <br>I asked her how she was.
    <br>She said "Daddy, I am okay."
    <br>I then knelt and said, "God thank You, I am delivered!"
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My name is Monica Abraham; I'm free!
    <br>I'm free. I don't even know how to explain it.
    <br>Before I was just... If not for Emmanuel TV, maybe I would have been dead now.
    <br>Because that's is the only thing that keeps me.
    <br>My brothers and sisters, please follow God.
    <br>Follow God for there is no shortcut.
    <br>It's only God that can heal you.
    <br>It's only God that can open a door.
    <br>No human being can open doors of blessing for you.
    <br>In Jesus' name. Shall we put our hands together for Christ Jesus?
