  <p>    
    <br>Wise Man Daniel is guided and regulated by the living Word,
    <br>to minister God's power of deliverance, healing, breakthrough and salvation
    <br>to the congregants during The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations live service.
    <br>Christ's power and goodness are neither scanty, nor scarce
    <br>and manifest mightily through the prayer and action of the wise man,
    <br>destroying the works of the devil and every hidden agenda in the lives of the people.
    <br>As he offered prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, the light of God fell upon this man
    <br>and began to wrestle his soul free from the clutches of darkness
    <br>which had kept him in bondage and disappointment for so long.
    <br>Watch as Jesus Christ rescues this man through the prayer of Wise Man Daniel.
    <br>Fire, all over your body, you demon!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ! Who are you?
    <br>I am marine spirit.
    <br>How many of you are in this body?
    <br>We are many.
    <br>Who is the second person?
    <br>Ogboni (cult).
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>I have destroyed him.
    <br>How far have you gone? 
    <br>What have you done to his career as a man?
    <br>What does he do for a living?
    <br>He is into entertainment.
    <br>What have you done to his career?
    <br>We have destroyed it; we don't want him to succeed in anything he does.
    <br>How far have you gone in destroying his career as a man?
    <br>We will destroy anything he lays his hand upon.
    <br>You destroyed anything he laid his hand upon?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What have you done to his marital life?
    <br>We have given him the spirit of lust.
    <br>How has the spirit of lust affected him?
    <br>He uses his eyes to see women; 
    <br>he sleeps with every woman he sees.
    <br>A lot of women.
    <br>What happened to those women - their career?
    <br>As soon as he sleeps with them, anything he does will fail.
    <br>Does it mean those women are your agents?
    <br>Yes, anything he does fails and he has the spirit of anger.
    <br>Listen to me and stop that nonsense: You send those women to him?
    <br>Yes, to destroy him.
    <br>How has the spirit of anger affected him?
    <br>A lot.
    <br>How?
    <br>He is very stubborn, he fights anybody that crosses his way.
    <br>You make him to fight anybody that crosses his way?
    <br>And when he fights, what happens to these people?
    <br>Before he knows it, he will find himself where he doesn't expect to be.
    <br>Can you give instances of the places he finds himself after fighting?
    <br>He fights policemen every day in Ghana, if he is driving.
    <br>Nobody can talk to him, anywhere.
    <br>What would happen to him at the end of the day?
    <br>He will end up spending all his money where he is not supposed to spend money
    <br>on something that is not necessary.
    <br>What have you done to his family?
    <br>He is supposed to be a pillar of his family, he is a great person.
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Open your eyes.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. In Jesus' name.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord. You are free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>I am dirty.
    <br>How come about that?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>I sat here.
    <br>- You were standing there?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Who pushed you down? 
    <br>You just stood up from the floor.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Indeed, thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My name is Chris Paul Abure.
    <br>I am a Nigerian living in Ghana.
    <br>By my right here is my mum.
    <br>Beside my mum is my mum's sister.
    <br>Those are my two younger sisters.
    <br>I am professional model; I am into modelling.
    <br>I am here to thank God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>It all happened 16 years ago.
    <br>I didn't know what I did to my dad, I offended him.
    <br>He called me into a room one-on-one, stripped himself and cursed me.
    <br>He said to me that I would never prosper in anything I did.
    <br>I didn't find it strange then because I thought he was just joking.
    <br>I didn't take it seriously.
    <br>I started acting funny since then.
    <br>I was no longer staying at home,
    <br>I started doing things I wasn't supposed to do.
    <br>I found myself smoking - I smoked a lot, I drank and womanised.
    <br>I found myself doing things that were funny.
    <br>One day, I felt like smoking; there was a spirit pushing me
    <br>to go to the beach to smoke.
    <br>So I went to the beach and started smoking.
    <br>I was just sitting on my own, smoking.
    <br>There was nobody on the beach; the place was quiet.
    <br>That day was not a 'beach day' that people usually came around on.
    <br>As I was smoking, before I knew it, I just saw a beautiful girl coming from behind me.
    <br>She tapped me on my back and said, "Handsome, how are you doing?"
    <br>I said, "Yeah, I am good".
    <br>Before I knew it, she had joined me.
    <br>She started asking me what my name was.
    <br>Before she could ask me the next question, we started kissing each other.
    <br>I didn't know her before.
    <br>We started kissing and I started enjoying what was happening
    <br>because she was very beautiful.
    <br>You mean, this happened physically or in a dream?
    <br>It was not in a dream, it was physical.
    <br>She told me that we should take a walk.
    <br>I said that I didn't feel like it and that I was okay where I was.
    <br>If she wanted to sit, she should sit and if she didn't feel like sitting, she should leave.
    <br>The next thing, as soon as I said that I didn't feel like walking
    <br>and was okay where I was -
    <br>the beach water was very far from me -
    <br>as I uttered that word, the next thing I saw was that the water was in front of me.
    <br>The water just came in front of me.
    <br>I said: "Ah, what is this?"
    <br>The girl asked, "What's wrong with you?"
    <br>and said that very soon, she would take me to where I belonged.
    <br>As soon as she used the words, 'take me where I belonged,'
    <br>I asked her, "Where do I belong?"
    <br>I said, "I bind you, in Jesus' name" but I was smoking.
    <br>Above everything, I believe in God but I couldn't stop my lifestyle.
    <br>I smoked a lot and womanised.
    <br>If I set my eyes on any girl, unless I didn't want her, she couldn't escape me;
    <br>I must get her down.
    <br>I slept with every girl that I came across.
    <br>I slept with a lot - I can't even count them but I thank God for today.
    <br>So that demon spirit affected you with the spirit of what?
    <br>Lust and anger.
    <br>These big things happened three times in my life and in three different countries.
    <br>It happened here in Nigeria, in Sierra Leone and in Ghana.
    <br>So each time you were sitting at the beach,
    <br>a strange lady would just come to you?
    <br>She would just walk to me and we would start kissing.
    <br>But the last one, I didn't kiss her.
    <br>The last one, the third one, the one that came in Ghana, I didn't kiss her.
    <br>I said, "I know who you are. Leave me".
    <br>She told me that she would get me.
    <br>There was a day in 2011 that I had a show.
    <br>After the show, the girl just walked to me and called me by my name, Chris Abure.
    <br>I was wondering and asked her, "How did you know my surname?"
    <br>On my Facebook, I didn't put my surname.
    <br>People knew me as Chris and I put my other name which is Abulome.
    <br>The girl called me by my name and I asked her, "How do you know my name?"
    <br>But I didn't mind because the girl was beautiful.
    <br>I just took her to the house.
    <br>When we got to my house, we were about to meet
    <br>when something came inside me and I said, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>I don't know what happened, I can't remember.
    <br>All I remember is that I just said: "Thank you, Jesus!"
    <br>Before I finished saying, "Thank You, Jesus," the girl started saying, "Leave me!"
    <br>She wanted to go and she was packing her things.
    <br>I started arguing, saying, "Let's finish what we started, where are you going?"
    <br>She was saying, "Don't touch me; there is fire".
    <br>She was running from me.
    <br>She started using the words, "You are lucky".
    <br>I asked her, "What do you mean by 'I am lucky?' What did you want to do to me?"
    <br>I started threatening her and saying that she couldn't do anything to me.
    <br>So we can see some pictures there, can you explain the pictures?
    <br>Those are my pictures.
    <br>I have done a couple of shows and commercials.
    <br>Sometimes, if I was doing a show, I would get mad with everybody.
    <br>Nobody could talk to me.
    <br>Unless you didn't cross my way, I would get you down.
    <br>With the spirit of anger, sometimes I would find myself in prison.
    <br>I would be drinking beer, maybe taking beer and someone would make me angry,
    <br>I would just break the beer bottle and stab the person.
    <br>I spent three weeks in prison in Burkina Faso, which is a country that is not mine.
    <br>I had been in prison in Guinea, Conakry and Mali.
    <br>At the end of the day, they would just release me because I didn't have anyone to bail me
    <br>but I still found myself doing the same thing.
    <br>I knew I had a problem but I didn't know the way out.
    <br>And how did this affect your job?
    <br>It affected me a lot.
    <br>Sometimes, if I went to some of my designers to see if they had a job for me,
    <br>they would tell me that they had given the job to another person already
    <br>who deserved the job more than I did.
    <br>Sometimes I would go for auditions, and they would pick me
    <br>that I was going to do the job, maybe it was a big commercial to play the key role.
    <br>As soon I got the job and everything was confirmed that I was going to do it,
    <br>if everything was confirmed today, the next morning, as soon as I got there, they would change their minds.
    <br>I usually had a lot of bad dreams.
    <br>Sometimes, if I didn't sleep with a girl that particular night,
    <br>I would always dream that I was having sex with a girl.
    <br>Sometimes, I would dream of seeing myself in my old school or old house.
    <br>I usually dreamt those kind of dreams a lot.
    <br>Okay, tell us, what effort did you make to find a solution to your problem
    <br>before you eventually came to The SCOAN?
    <br>I had been to a lot of places and spiritual houses for solution
    <br>because I knew I had a problem; I saw that I was not moving forward.
    <br>A lot of people that I started with were very far from me
    <br>and because of that, I searched for solution but the solution was zero.
    <br>So how did you come to know about The SCOAN?
    <br>It all happened last year.
    <br>Actually, I will not lie to you - I did not believe in Prophet T.B. Joshua before.
    <br>It happened last year.
    <br>I usually saw what Prophet T.B. Joshua was doing on television.
    <br>I started watching when I came across him on television, preaching,
    <br>doing healing and all those kinds of things, I watched the miracles.
    <br>One day, in my office, they all had the Anointing Water
    <br>and my elder brother gave me some of the  Anointing Water and I drank it.
    <br>I felt some funny thing moving all over my body.
    <br>I felt some funny things happening in my body.
    <br>I didn't know what was happening, actually.
    <br>That was on Thursday night.
    <br>Thursday in Ghana was kind of a reggae day in some places.
    <br>I got there.
    <br>Usually, I would go and smoke before I did my performance.
    <br>I was about to smoke but I did not feel like smoking anymore.
    <br>I didn't feel like smoking; it happened like that.
    <br>That was how since the middle of last year, I stopped smoking.
    <br>So you mean after your elder brother gave you the Anointing Water,
    <br>and you took the Anointing Water and ministered it to yourself,
    <br>the urge to smoke disappeared?
    <br>Exactly, that was how it died.
    <br>You were telling us a while ago about the experience
    <br>you used to have at the beach side -
    <br>a strange lady would just walk to you each time at the beach side.
    <br>What happened to you each time in your career, in your life?
    <br>If I was going anywhere on the next day, I didn't prosper in anything I did.
    <br>If I met anyone - failure.
    <br>The good things that I was supposed to get - I wouldn't;
    <br>they would give me lesser ones which I was not happy with.
    <br>I knew that I had a problem.
    <br>So tell us, since you came to The SCOAN, what happened?
    <br>It all happened two weeks ago when I dreamt.
    <br>It was my first time to see the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua delivering me in my dream.
    <br>When I woke up from that dream, I thought,
    <br>"Prophet T.B. Joshua delivered me in my dream, that means I am free from my problem".
    <br>I explained to my elder brother that Prophet T.B. Joshua had delivered me in my dreams
    <br>and he said that I still needed to go to The SCOAN and that I really needed deliverance.
    <br>That was how I found my way to the church here.
    <br>Could you remember anything that happened when the wise men were moving round?
    <br>I didn't know what happened, I just found myself on the floor.
    <br>They said that I said something but I didn't know what happened.
    <br>They said that you said something? You didn't know you said anything?
    <br>No.
    <br>And after the deliverance - tell us, how did you feel immediately
    <br>and since then, tell us your condition now.
    <br>Since then, I have been okay, I am a different person now.
    <br>I don't feel the way I used to.
    <br>Previously, sometimes, I would just sit on my own thinking evil, nothing but evil.
    <br>I would be thinking how to do something evil to people.
    <br>Those were the things that ran through my mind - evil and bad things.
    <br>But since I came here, I have not thought that way anymore.
    <br>And the anger?
    <br>The spirit of anger - even if you slapped me right now, I wouldn't return the slap;
    <br>You would just say, "Thank you".
    <br>I would say, "Thank you".
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>And the spirit of lust that had ruled and ruined your life -
    <br>tell us, since after your deliverance?
    <br>Since then, I haven't felt anything for any girl anymore, except my wife.
    <br>You don't see any other?
    <br>I haven't looked at any girl, even if she was beautiful.
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus! Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>My name is Mrs Abure.
    <br>The one beside me is my son.
    <br>This woman is my younger sister.
    <br>Those two girls are my daughters.
    <br>I just want to thank God.
    <br>He called me a day before the day that he came to The SCOAN.
    <br>He said that he was coming to Nigeria for a programme.
    <br>I was happy and said, "Okay, pray for us".
    <br>He called me that they had delivered him and we would even see him on television.
    <br>My son, his elder brother, when he came to Nigeria,
    <br>asked me if I had Emmanuel TV and I said no.
    <br>He paid money and they came and installed Emmanuel TV for me.
    <br>Since then, I watch it 24 hours a day.
    <br>My son called me saying that Christopher was manifesting.
    <br>I asked, "My son is manifesting?"
    <br>I watched it on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>In the night, I called him after he had been delivered.
    <br>He said, "Yes, I have been delivered".
    <br>Previously, he was very stubborn.
    <br>When my senior son came to Nigeria, he reported me
    <br>that nobody could talk to him and the life he was living was wayward.
    <br>When someone talked to him, he was ready to fight that person,
    <br>to break a bottle and stab that person.
    <br>Since he was delivered, I have been very happy.
    <br>I am the happiest woman in the whole world.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>That says it all. Mama says that she is the happiest woman in the world today,
    <br>seeing her son completely delivered from his past ways of life.
    <br>That gives her peace, joy and comfort.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for her life, and can we hear from the auntie.
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Comfort Wiyas.
    <br>I thank God for his life.
    <br>We are all happy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Emmanuel!
    <br>God with us. Let us clap for Jesus one more time!
    <br>With what the Lord has done in your life, you have come a long way through life.
    <br>Now, what word of advice or encouragement
    <br>do you have for people who are listening to your testimony
    <br>and also for people who are in the same profession as you,
    <br>knowing the kind of life that they live out there -
    <br>now that you have seen the light, what word of advice do you have for them?
    <br>I know that there are a lot of people watching me right now.
    <br>My advice to them is that they should stick to God's Word.
    <br>He will never fail them.
    <br>If you listen to my story and see all that I have passed through, it was not easy.
    <br>Sometimes, you see yourself doing some funny things.
    <br>You would think it was you or it was fun or enjoyment,
    <br>seeing yourself being with some pretty girls and smoking -
    <br>those things are demonic.
    <br>It is not the real you doing those things.
    <br>You need to be delivered; all you need is your freedom
    <br>because if you are not delivered, there is nothing that will work well for you.
    <br>Things might be working well for you right now.
    <br>You may think that it is by your own making but all you need right now
    <br>is to seek the face of God.
    <br>If you do that, your life will never remain the same again.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Amen! Thank you very much. Let's clap for Jesus!
    <br>Wonderful advice, thank you.
