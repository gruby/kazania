    <br>Open your lips, ask Jesus to give you prayer language.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Give me a tongue.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my soul away,
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow

    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my soul away
    <br>He holds the key to my life.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Even without asking, Jesus is working out the answer.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, whatever challenges you are in,
    <br>whatever difficulty or pain - it could be sickness -
    <br>remember, a demon is behind it.
    <br>It could be failure - remember, a demon is behind it.
    <br>It could be limitation in progress - remember, a demon is behind it.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to rebuke this demon.
    <br>Demon!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Rebuke them!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Whatever means demons might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>whatever way satan might have used to connect your career to himself,
    <br>to connect your business, to connect your future,
    <br>to connect your marital life to himself - begin to break it, right now.
    <br>Break it!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Watch the screen of your television, you can see the proof that satan
    <br>and his agents are no match for the all-consuming fire of God.
    <br>Viewers all around the world, in mercy you have not been excluded.
    <br>Touch the screen of your television right now and receive your deliverance, your healing,
    <br>by faith in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I'm not saying words; I'm praying prayer.
    <br>Just repeat after me:
    <br>Whatever means, whatever way satan might have used
    <br>to connect you to himself - begin to rebuke it!
    <br>Break it!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Viewers all over the world, continue to break it!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever way - it could be immorality, failure or unfaithfulness,
    <br>whatever way satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>begin to break that relationship!
    <br>Break it!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Viewers all over the world, continue to pray with Prophet TB Joshua right now.
    <br>As it is happening here, in The SCOAN headquarters, it will happen wherever you are by faith.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remember, satan has many ways he uses to connect people to himself.
    <br>It could be disobedience - he uses disobedience to connect you.
    <br>He can use hatred; these are his weapons.
    <br>He can use immorality; these are his weapons.
    <br>Once you are connected, you become an agent.
    <br>Now, we want to break all these - all these means!
    <br>Begin to mention those things satan uses to connect you to himself.
    <br>You know those things, you know them. Mention them.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Viewers around the world, join prophet T.B. Joshua in this mass prayer section.
    <br>The power of God is removing them from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Viewers, whatever way satan might have used to connect you to himself -
    <br>it could be disobedience.
    <br>These are weapons - weapons of disobedience, hatred, greediness,
    <br>killing, stealing, destruction, immorality, disobedience.
    <br>Whatever way satan might have used,
    <br>right now, begin to break the connection!
    <br>Break the connection!
    <br>Say - you satan, I break the connection!
    <br>That connection - break it!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, break it!
    <br>Break it!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Viewers all over the world, what you are seeing is the manifestation of the evil spirits.
    <br>People are vomiting out all poisonous substances
    <br> that have  been deposited in their systems, they have been set free from the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>As you are watching the screen of your television, step in faith believing that
    <br>your case will not escape the anointing of God.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier, Jesus Christ is reachable, you can touch Him wherever you are.
    <br>Right now, touch the screen of your television and believe.
    <br>Break the connection!
    <br>It could be greediness, selfishness, killing or stealing.
    <br>It could be disobedience or unfaithfulness.
    <br>It could be hatred, stealing, killing, greediness or immorality - break it!
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my soul away
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my soul away
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my soul away
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my soul away
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my soul away
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>If satan does not have connection,
    <br>if there is no wire between you and satan,
    <br>satan cannot even touch you.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Some of his connections - disobedience, unfaithfulness
    <br>immorality, stealing, killing, destruction - these are the connections.
    <br>You are his tools and agent.
    <br>Now, this is personal confession; open your lips and begin to disconnect yourself.
    <br>Whatever way satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>whether hatred, unfaithfulness or lying -
    <br>maybe sometimes you lie -
    <br>w hatever way satan might have used or is using to connect you to himself,
    <br>open your lips and begin to break that connection!
    <br>I break it, right now!
    <br>Open your lips, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to break the connection!
    <br>Break the connection!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Break the connection!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Break the connection!
    <br>Say - I break the connection!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Break the connection!
    <br>Begin to break the connection!
    <br>Break it!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>We are talking of character.
    <br>God's Word reflects His character.
    <br>We are talking of salvation, now.
    <br>Something more than miracles. We are talking of the salvation of your soul.
    <br>That is what we are praying for.
    <br>The way satan connects you to himself and begins to toy with you...
    <br>You know tow vehicle - he will begin to tow you everywhere.
    <br>You become an agent.
    <br>In the night you say that somebody came and hit you.
    <br>Somebody came and has    an affair with you but you cannot resist.
    <br>Why? Because satan has connected you to himself.
    <br>This is the experience many of you are having -
    <br>in your dream, when you wake up, you say: "Ah, my guest slept with me last night!"
    <br>And this is a guy in the physical, he respects you,
    <br>but at night he will ride you.
    <br>The reason you cannot resist is because you have become an agent.
    <br>Satan has connected you to himself and he has used this weapons -
    <br>weapons of unrighteousness, disobedience, immorality, lying, stealing.
    <br>Begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>Disconnect yourself!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say: "I disconnect myself!"
    <br>Whatever weapon, whatever way satan might have used
    <br>to connect me to himself -
    <br>begin to disconnect yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know, we are carrying you along - glory be to God!
    <br>It is happening in your home.
    <br>Those weapons satan uses are the fruits of the flesh -
    <br>immorality, disobedience, unfaithfulness, hatred,
    <br>unforgiving spirit - these are weapons.
    <br>And once he is using this to connect you to himself,
    <br>he will begin to tow you like a vehicle - you know, like towing a vehicle.
    <br>Anywhere he tows you, anywhere he drags you - you go, you become an agent. He can say: "Go!" or: "Сome!",
    <br>because you are being connected to satan.
    <br>So therefore, whatever way satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>Begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>Disconnect yourself!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Disconnect yourself as the man of God has said.
    <br>The evidence of the grace of Calvary is what we are witnessing in the life of people,
    <br>as they are vomiting, shouting, screaming and manifesting, coming out of their darkness.
    <br>God is exposing the darkness in the life of the people
    <br>through the faculty of the man of God right now.
    <br>Stay connected - everywhere in the world, wherever you are viewing, stay connected.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my breath away
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my soul away
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>When sickness and sorrow
    <br>Seem to take my soul away
    <br>He holds the key to my life
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Say, "Thank You for my salvation."
    <br>Right now, begin to confess these.
    <br>I submit myself to be an agent of truth,
    <br>an agent of love,
    <br>an agent of faithfulness,
    <br>and obedience - begin to confess it.
    <br>In Jesus' name, confess it.
    <br>I submit myself today to be an agent of faithfulness,

    <br>How does a victor talk?
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past.

    <br>I'm no longer condemned!
    <br>I'm born again!
    <br>I'm redeemed!
