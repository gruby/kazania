  <p>    
    <br>A message the Lord said I should give to my African Continent:
    <br>No African country can succeed alone.
    <br>Africans need each other to develop.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Africans need each other to develop.]
    <br>West Africa needs Southern Africa to develop.
    <br>Southern Africa needs West Africa to develop.
    <br>North Africa needs East Africa to develop
    <br>and East Africa needs North Africa to develop.
    <br>No one is self-sufficient.
    <br>We cannot do without each other.
    <br>Everyone has a contribution.
    <br>Whether you are poor, rich or an immigrant,
    <br>everyone has a contribution for the development of Africa, at the level we are now.
    <br>Dear Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.
    <br>With regard to the issue of illegal immigrants, drugs and other crimes,
    <br>our duty is to inform law enforcement agencies.
    <br>That is our duty - to give them useful information about issues like that.
    <br>In our respective countries, it is our duty to inform law enforcement agencies.
    <br>It is only when they fail to carry out their duty that we citizens can lawfully protest.
    <br>When I think about the future of Africa, I have sleepless nights.
    <br>Within Africa, if we are now fighting ourselves,
    <br>look at what is happening in other continents concerning Africa.
    <br>Within continents, there is fight among the youths.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Everything looks gloomy, frustrating, hopeless, dark, darksome, dull and sunless.
    <br>Africa, unite!
    <br>No African country can succeed alone; we need each other to develop.
    <br>So, if we cannot understand ourselves within Africa,
    <br>do you mean they will understand us in other continents?
    <br>Dear Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>Fellow Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Fellow Africans, we should not let other fellow Africans feel unwelcome to our countries.]
    <br>No African country can succeed, can develop alone.
    <br>When it now comes to the issue of people taking drugs to a country or crimes,
    <br>our duty is to work with law enforcement by giving them useful information
    <br>about these people that are doing this.
    <br>That is our duty - but if they now fail to do so, then lawfully we can protest.
    <br>I cannot just leave here without remembering our nation, South Africa.
    <br>So, the challenges they have...
    <br>The world should know that every country has their challenges.
    <br>The wound of one should be the wound of all.
    <br>Whatever happens in any African country, we should come together - what can we do?
    <br>Every African should be concerned about whatever happens in Nigeria.
    <br>Every African country should be concerned about whatever happens in South Africa.
    <br>We should see it as if it happens in the whole African continent.
    <br>The wound of one should be the wound of all.
    <br>Every continent is like a human being; Africa is like a human being.
    <br>South Africa may be a hand; Ghana may be another hand.
    <br>Nigeria may be one leg; Benin may be another leg.
    <br>Congo may be an eye; another country like Togo may be the mouth.
    <br>If anything happens to any part of this body, the whole body will feel it.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>A continent is like a human being.
    <br>Like I'm here now.
    <br>If anything happened to my finger here, just my fingernail,
    <br>I may likely not come to the service;
    <br>I would feel headache, high blood pressure, fever - just my finger.
    <br>That is the way it should be until Africa sees its challenges as all.
    <br>The wound of one should be the wound of all.
    <br>But today, whenever anything happens to one country like Nigeria -
    <br>"Ey Nigeria, this happened."
    <br>South Africa: "This happened; let's go and carry our people."
    <br>Nigeria: "Let's go and carry our people" - where are you carrying your people to? 
    <br>It's Africa.
    <br>Why can't you come together and redeem our continent?
    <br>Africa, unite!
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Africa, unite!]
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Africa, unite!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Africa, unite!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Africa, unite!]
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>[Africa, unite!]
    <br>Tell those who care to listen.
    <br>[Africa, unite!]
    <br>People care to listen - raise up your hand.
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>[Africa, unite!]
    <br>Unite!
    <br>We have a common enemy - satan!
    <br>So why can't you?
    <br>Whatever happens in any country, instead of coming together as one and fight the enemy...
    <br>We have one enemy camouflaged differently, uniformed differently.
    <br>When you carry a soldier to war, Nigerian has its uniform for soldiers,
    <br>South Africa has a different uniform for soldiers.
    <br>One common enemy but camouflaged differently.
    <br>What is happening there can happen in any country.
    <br>Africa, unite. We have a common enemy, camouflaged differently.
    <br>Camouflage, as you know, is a uniform worn by soldiers.
    <br>When there is a war in any country, different countries will send their soldiers.
    <br>Each country has its own uniform.
    <br>Nigerian uniform for soldiers is different from the South African one -
    <br>Ghana own different, Togo own different.
    <br>But when they come to a country where they want to fight a war,
    <br>you will see the camouflage is different but common enemy.
    <br>Africa, unite. The wound of one is the wound of all.
    <br>I will not say more than that.
    <br>Truth is bitter.
    <br>Africa, unite. We have a common enemy, camouflaged differently.
    <br>We are praying for the nation and God is in control.
    <br>Africa, unite. Thank you.
