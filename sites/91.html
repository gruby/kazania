    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>At The SCOAN Live Service, Wise Man Christopher ministers God's Word and power
    <br>to the people in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>the Wise Man is led to pray for this lady,
    <br>who begins to undergo spirit deliverance from the yoke of satan upon her life.
    <br>Let's watch what happened next.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Speak! Who are you?
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>We are languages from the third and fourth heavens.
    <br>Pastors use us without discerning.
    <br>We rule churches. Members speak. If you like, try me.
    <br>We abort babies; no one carries babies
    <br>and when we use that language, that pregnancy is gone.
    <br>When we touch your stomach, we rule; we take absolute control.
    <br>We are pledges her ancestors did not redeem. We go and come.
    <br>As for our language, it takes mighty hands to take it away.
    <br>We easily give free of charge. You cannot send us away.
    <br>You said, you rule.
    <br>We rule. Yes, we rule.
    <br>How do you rule?
    <br>We give languages they do not understand.
    <br>Instead of them to use their plain words to speak to God,
    <br>they use languages that they don't understand.
    <br>When they speak, we come. We descend mightily.
    <br>She said she went for a prayer meeting.
    <br>One of the members taught her how to speak in tongues.
    <br>She didn't know it was fake.
    <br>When she is pregnant, we abort it.
    <br>You said when people speak in different languages they don't understand,
    <br>you make use of this language to destroy them.
    <br>How many of such people have you destroyed
    <br>and how do you carry out this destruction?
    <br>Oh! When you speak, you invite us. We come to the church.
    <br>Who are you people?
    <br>Spirits from the third and fourth heavens.
    <br>They dance around the kingdom of snake.
    <br>Her surname is that of a royal python.
    <br>The local one, they call it the "dabri" - royal python.
    <br>Her ancestors did not redeem that pledge - they didn't.
    <br>The men womanise. The women, when they marry, they are sent out.
    <br>She thinks she wants to run to light.
    <br>We saw her star, her star of light, shining in darkness.
    <br>We would not allow her to shine.
    <br>She sees. When she sleeps, she has thousand dreams.
    <br>No one to interpret because we didn't allow her to understand.
    <br>How do you carry out your plan of destruction of those that speak in
    <br>languages they do not understand? Explain.
    <br>When they come, pastors speak and do not understand.
    <br>They cannot discern; they are not good sheperds.
    <br>They would place their hands on your tummy and pray for safe delivery,
    <br>praying for you to carry the pregnancy safely.
    <br>When we put our hands there, we take possession of the womb.
    <br>How long have you been operating?
    <br>Long ago.
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>For her career - she is a good teacher.
    <br>But when she was writing on the board the last time I visited her,
    <br>the children went out and she was going to write 'homework' on the board.
    <br>She saw me laughing but didn't mind. Do you know why?
    <br>She was carrying the Anointing Sticker.
    <br>She told me there was fire around her.
    <br>What is in the Anointing Sticker from The SCOAN?
    <br>Is it not fire?
    <br>If we come with fire, you will quench it with water.
    <br>She is always sleeping under her TV with Anointing Stickers here and there.
    <br>We can't.
    <br>That is how you people have been tormenting us.
    <br>You said you can't, why?
    <br>How can we go near her?
    <br>One day, she forgot to pray and when she was sleeping, we came.
    <br>She refused to speak in tongues.
    <br>When she discovered that we were chasing her, she spoke in tongues and we replied.
    <br>Then, she refused to speak.
    <br>We forced her that night to speak.
    <br>When she spoke, we injected her leg.
    <br>We forced medicine into her throat and there's nothing here.
    <br>What have you done to her husband?
    <br>As for her husband, they handed him to us, the supreme authority.
    <br>Supreme authority, where?
    <br>Third and fourth heavens.
    <br>So, we took control.
    <br>When they take their salaries, it is nowhere to be found.
    <br>How did you enter this body?
    <br>Is it not drink and food?
    <br>Then, the ancestors. It was long ago.
    <br>We come and go.
    <br>It is only mighty and strong hands that can take her away.
    <br>Did you know that she was coming to The SCOAN where you cannot escape?
    <br>I knew you'd chain me. You seized me with chains.
    <br>How can I escape?
    <br>You demons, Jesus Christ is greater than the combined forces of hell and earth.
    <br>You have no hiding place. Now, go!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, come out of this body!
    <br>Come back here! Come out of her!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come out of her!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You must!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come out of this body, you principalities!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out! You must!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come out of this body!
    <br>This is not your temple. Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>You must!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come out of her!
    <br>We will leave her womb.
    <br>You have no option than to leave.
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Hallelujah. In Jesus' name.
    <br>Sister, rise up. You are delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Sister, how are you?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>What are you doing there?
    <br>I am relaxing.
    <br>You are doing what?
    <br>Relaxing.
    <br>Can you remember what happened to you?
    <br>No, I was just feeling dizzy.
    <br>You said that you are demons operating in the third and fourth heavens.
    <br>No, I am a human being.
    <br>And you use speaking in tongues to initiate and destroy people.
    <br>I went for a service where they told us to receive the fruits of the Spirit.
    <br>People were praying in tongues.
    <br>I told the leader that I had not received, so I couldn't speak.
    <br>I slept and dreamt of a certain woman in church who held a high position.
    <br>She was speaking and asked me in my dream to speak along with her.
    <br>When I woke up, I told the leader.
    <br>He told me that was it; I would speak.
    <br>When I started speaking - one night, people were chasing me
    <br>and when I spoke, they replied.
    <br>It was when I was pregnant that the pressure came to speak in tongues.
    <br>I am not a demon.
    <br>That demon that made use of your body in the past is cast out
    <br>and will never return to you.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Follow Jesus. He is the One who has set you free. Follow Him.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am delivered forever! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Mrs Bembeh Cornelia.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>We are from Ghana.
    <br>I want to thank God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>He delivered me and saved my life.
    <br>It all started when I was yearning to grow in the Spirit.
    <br>I was born into an orthodox church.
    <br>We were advised that if you wanted to grow in the Spirit,
    <br>you should join their charismatic group. So, I decided to join.
    <br>When we joined, they asked us to go through a 'Life In The Spirit' seminar
    <br>where we would be guided to receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>So, in the process, we would go on weekends.
    <br>My family was 'Dabri', which in English is 'The Royal Python'.
    <br>After I joined the charismatic group,
    <br>the night they prayed that we should receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>there were so many gifts mentioned.
    <br>When it was time for the gift of tongues, I couldn't receive and was sad.
    <br>I went to sleep that night and saw one of the leaders in my dream
    <br>who was speaking in tongues.
    <br>She asked me to speak as she was speaking but I couldn't.
    <br>The next day, I approached the Reverend in charge.
    <br>He asked me to speak what I heard and I did.
    <br>He said that I should take it up from there as that was it.
    <br>So, I started speaking in tongues.
    <br>The next night, I saw a big snake
    <br>and the snake spoke to me in a language I understood.
    <br>In that dream, I got scared and woke up.
    <br>Later, I saw strange women chasing me.
    <br>I decided to pray but realised that in my prayers, it was not coming out.
    <br>I tried every means to run away from them.
    <br>In my prayers, I spoke in tongues and the strange women replied to me.
    <br>I got afraid. They also spoke in tongues but I couldn't understand.
    <br>I woke up from the dream and was very scared.
    <br>Any time I went to churches and prayer meetings,
    <br>I would hear people speak the same language
    <br>the strange women spoke to me in the dream.
    <br>Any time they spoke it, I felt some movements in my tummy.
    <br>At times, I would get goose pimples on my body.
    <br>The job for the church of God now is to come together
    <br>and send out the strange people that enter the church.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the job. If not, I don't see the church growing again.
    <br>The main job now for the church of God is to come together,
    <br>pray and send out these strange people.
    <br>Can't you hear what she is saying?
    <br>She said the next time she went into the church,
    <br>she started hearing the same language those strange women spoke.
    <br>Everybody was speaking that in the same church, ignorantly.
    <br>So to flush out these people in the church, we have to pray to God, come together -
    <br>it is not what one person can do; the body must come together, fast and pray.
    <br>These strange spirits entered the church and have taken the prominent seats.
    <br>The most prominent - they are not just ordinary church members;
    <br>they are in a prominent position.
    <br>That makes it very difficult.
    <br>Can you now say that this sister is a foolish sister?
    <br>She doesn't know what she is saying?
    <br>Look at the beauty, the appearance of the person that is talking.
    <br>Look at what she is saying.
    <br>You know the last time when the issue of churches, this and that was coming in -
    <br>they said, is this church a church of God, this church is a church of God.
    <br>No, the name does not matter.
    <br>What matters is the righteousness of God.
    <br>What matters is the Bible which is our standard.
    <br>What matters is what we are doing in the assembly.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: What matters is what we are doing in the assembly.
    <br>The name of the assembly, the name of the church does not matter.
    <br>What matters is what we are doing in the assembly.
    <br>Not where you are but what you are.
    <br>You say, one is orthodox, one is this,
    <br>one is charismatic, one is pentecostal,
    <br>one is this, one is that. Those names do not matter.
    <br>What matters is what we are doing in the assembly.
    <br>After I began speaking in tongues, I realised that it was scaring me.
    <br>At night, when I went outside, I couldn't look into the sky
    <br>because I saw snakes and strange animals coming out from the sky.
    <br>Physically, I saw snakes all around me, chasing me.
    <br>People that died long ago, whom I knew, were all around me and coffins.
    <br>At times, I would hear strange voices, telling me I would die.
    <br>I saw myself being pushed into a grave or sea.
    <br>I couldn't bear it anymore. So, I was looking for my deliverance everywhere.
    <br>When I was about to get married, on the eve of my marriage,
    <br>I heard strange voices calling me.
    <br>I hesitated. So, they started shooting arrows at me.
    <br>I had to run quickly to the prayer centre and sleep there.
    <br>It was the same church that I was attending that had this charismatic group.
    <br>You are telling us now that the same church now formed a charismatic group, isn't it?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>We want you to put more light on how they formed the charismatic group,
    <br>how you acquired this speaking in tongues,
    <br>how you received it in the dream,
    <br>and when you met the minister, how the minister encouraged you.
    <br>It was that night that they prayed for us to receive the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>I could not and I was sad
    <br>because the reverend in charge told us that one of the easiest gifts to receive
    <br>from the Holy Spirit was that of speaking in tongues.
    <br>I was sad and went to sleep.
    <br>In my dream, I saw one of the leaders.
    <br>She asked me to speak after her in the dream.
    <br>But I could not speak in the dream.
    <br>The next day, I went to the reverend and explained my encounter in the dream to him.
    <br>Ok. In that dream, you saw one of the ministers?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And she said to you in that dream that you should speak after her
    <br>but in that dream, you could not say it?
    <br>No, I couldn't say it.
    <br>But then you woke up...
    <br>And I asked the reverend.
    <br>Physically?
    <br>Yes. He asked me to speak the way the woman did.
    <br>I did; I spoke in tongues.
    <br>He said, "That is it; begin from there, you will grow in it".
    <br>The day I spoke to him, it was just a short one.
    <br>Later on, I realised it became very lengthy.
    <br>I could not stop it; the urge kept coming.
    <br>When I was pregnant, the urge increased.
    <br>Before I knew it, I miscarried.
    <br>How did you then know that what you were doing was wrong;
    <br>speaking in tongues - the one you were saying was not from God
    <br>but from the pit of hell? How did you know?
    <br>I realised it when I was being chased by strange women in my dreams.
    <br>I was praying but the actual prayer in plain language was not coming.
    <br>Suddenly, my speaking in tongues came and it was bold.
    <br>The women in my dream replied to me in tongues.
    <br>That was when I got scared.
    <br>When I went to churches, I heard pastors and prayer warriors
    <br>praying in the same language and I got frightened.
    <br>That was when I realised that it was fake.
    <br>Since last week when I was delivered,
    <br>I don't have the urge to speak it anymore and I sleep soundly.
    <br>What are your dreams?
    <br>At times, I dream I'm in the chapel working with you or I'm somewhere teaching children.
    <br>Why should deliverance flush out that tongue?
    <br>If that tongue is from God, the deliverance should enhance it.
    <br>That means it is not from the same source.
    <br>90% of us speak what we don't understand
    <br>and what we cannot stand to say is from this place, from that place.
    <br>Ask your neighbour: Are we actually saved?
    <br>But mind you, there is true tongue from Heaven!
    <br>There is speaking in tongues from Heaven.
    <br>But how do we know?
    <br>Ask your neighbour: How do we know the one from God?
    <br>The one from God will give you comfort and peace.
    <br>If that tongue is from God, it will first of all work on you,
    <br>before you can begin to work on others.
    <br>The Bible says, you are saved to save others.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You are saved to save others.
    <br>It is not possible for someone who is not saved to begin to save others.
    <br>You will first of all be saved before you can now save others.
    <br>Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
    <br>It is what you carry, what is inside here, that will speak out and give to others.
    <br>You cannot give all what is here; you just give out of it.
    <br>It is not possible to give all you have; you give out of it.
    <br>And the person will now be the one to build on it by staying steadfast in the Lord.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>So, I will give you out of this - out of many, I will give you.
    <br>When I give you, you now stand for God.
    <br>From there, you will begin to build on it.
    <br>So, it is not possible for someone who is speaking in tongues
    <br>now to face bitterness, pain and keep speaking in tongues.
    <br>That is to tell you - look, this one is from the pit of hell.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ali Bimpe.
    <br>The woman standing by my side is my lovely wife.
    <br>I am here to thank God for what He has done in our lives by delivering my wife
    <br>and also to confirm that all she said is true.
    <br>We got married about three and a half years ago and there the problem started.
    <br>We never slept in our room in the night.
    <br>She was always seeing things in the air.
    <br>Anytime she slept, she always woke up, complaining of a terrible dream,
    <br>seeing dead people.
    <br>You mean, when you were together in the house, she spoke this language?
    <br>Yes, she did sometimes.
    <br>She had been seeing dead people in her dreams.
    <br>Sometimes, she saw people drawing her into a water or a grave.
    <br>She saw other smaller demons.
    <br>Thank you very much. I want to meet the family, I want to be part of your family.
    <br>So, thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is tongue, speaking in tongues.
    <br>But there is fake one.
    <br>How will you know when you don't know what you are saying?
    <br>If I'm talking when I don't know that God is the one that is talking through me,
    <br>how will I know that it is not from satan then?
    <br>It is when I know that what I'm saying is from God,
    <br>that is when I can also believe that it will do what I asked it to do.
    <br>But when I say something and I don't know that what I'm saying is from God,
    <br>definitely, any creature can have access to it.
    <br>If I'm talking to you?
    <br>It can be manipulated.
    <br>When you say something, "cha cha cha", this "cha cha cha", where is it from?
    <br>Is this "cha cha cha" from God?
