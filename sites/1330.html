  <p>    
    <br>Thank you. Good Morning!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>I'm here to give you just a short word of exhortation.
    <br>You know God is working out the answer.
    <br>You remember the message given to you concerning reporting which is very important
    <br>and I know you are doing what the Word says.
    <br>It's an issue that will really help you in your domestic affairs, your company
    <br>and everywhere you find yourself.
    <br>The Bible says salvation is of confession and believing
    <br>so you must know that reporting should be an expression of believing.
    <br>Reporting should be an expression of believing.
    <br>Wherever you find yourself as a Christian, you are to report what you see.
    <br>As a Christian, wherever you find yourself, you are to report what you see and hear.
    <br>When you report what you see and what you hear, it settles issues, it answers questions,
    <br>it clarifies doubts and provides a way forward.
    <br>Work alone cannot help any establishment grow.
    <br>Every establishment expects two things from you: working and reporting.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Working and reporting.]
    <br>Today you are here in the church.
    <br>You are to report whatever you see that is wrong among the workers and the members.
    <br>Don't just leave.
    <br>"No, no. Look at the way the woman behaved."
    <br>You know when we were in the church, the woman was disturbing.
    <br>Discussing this at home is a sin.
    <br>You have to report it in church; you have to write it down and give it to the usher,
    <br>"Please, I'm giving you this. Make sure you submit it to the authority".
    <br>You have to be vigilant of what is going on.
    <br>"Look at that woman. From this group to another group.
    <br>Look at her moving around. Why is she talking like that? See the way she moves!"
    <br>"See the way he passes a note! A worker!"
    <br>You have to report.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>That is very important.
    <br>Reporting should be an expression of believing.
    <br>Unruly behaviours.
    <br>Not only that: the visions you have about your establishment, dreams.
    <br>There are many visions and dreams you often have.
    <br>God will show you.
    <br>You have to send a letter or a mail.
    <br>You can even because of that travel from your country to another country -
    <br>just because of that vision because you are a believer.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I'm thanking you for your prayer because God has spoken, regardless of our situations.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you honestly examine your heart in the light of God's Word,
    <br>you will discover that there is a spirit of unforgiveness, a spirit of anger,
    <br>a spirit of bitterness, a spirit of jealousy, a spirit of envy
    <br>and such a spirit break our communion with God, our relationship with God.
    <br>It opens the door to whatever situation you are in now.
    <br>You say, "I have sickness".
    <br>What is the route of sickness? Unforgiveness.
    <br>Hardship - what is the route of hardship? Envy, jealousy and anger.
    <br>That is the route, the road to get to you.
    <br>Nightmare, barrenness, anger, jealousy, unforgiveness, bitterness - these are routes.
    <br>You will see many people you have put in the prison yard and you are still walking everywhere.
    <br>You will see people that are in bondage just because of you.
    <br>Are you talking of divorce?
    <br>Many men you have divorced; many women you have divorced.
    <br>You say, "Over your life, the woman will not see the children!"
    <br>What is your problem?
    <br>Why will the woman not see her children; why will the man not see his children?
    <br>You have divorced him or her.
    <br>And you are calling, "God, God!" - for what?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You people have divorced.
    <br>You say, "The man will not see the children again!"
    <br>and you are trying to keep these children away from the man or the woman.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Father, forgive them" - both accused and accuser.
    <br>"Father, forgive them" - both wrong and right.
    <br>You say it is witchcraft, they bewitched you, they attacked you.
    <br>Who attacked you?
    <br>When you are carrying an unforgiving spirit, envy and jealousy, you say they attacked you.
    <br>You don't need to be attacked; once you have that spirit, you have attacked yourself.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Listen to me again.
    <br>It opens the door to whatever challenges you are in.
    <br>Are you sick, facing hardship, poverty, loneliness, rejection?
    <br>Whatever you are facing, the route of those things is unforgiveness, envy, jealousy, bitterness.
    <br>These are the routes.
    <br>You don't need the enemy to attack you; once you have these, you have attacked yourself.
    <br>Once the relationship is broken, what else again?
    <br>You are accessible to satan.
    <br>It breaks the communion; it breaks the relationship.
    <br>These are the things that break the relationship.
    <br>Once your relationship breaks with God, what else again? You are on your own.
    <br>Unforgiveness, envy, jealousy, bitterness, strife and hatred
    <br>open the door to whatever you are in.
    <br>When you leave here now, it is not too late.
    <br>Just from your heart, you can say, "Yes, what this man says, I am ready".
    <br>Once you say you are ready and you concur in your heart, the job is done.
    <br>When you leave here, you can continue to reconcile, send a test message,
    <br>a phone call and try to settle yourself.
    <br>I release you from the pain of the past.
    <br>I release you from the unforgiving spirit, that bitterness, envy, jealousy.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You know you can be released.
    <br>You know that?
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Such spirits break the communion, relationship with God.
    <br>Once it breaks, you are on your own.
    <br>Once you are on your own, here is poverty; here is affliction.
    <br>Once you are on your own, here is hardship.
    <br>Once you are on your own, here is rejection.
    <br>Once you are on your own, here is nightmare.
    <br>With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves.
    <br>With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves, heals, blesses and delivers.
    <br>You say, "I am healed!" You are about to lose that healing with that unforgiving spirit.
    <br>You are about to lose that deliverance with that unforgiving spirit,
    <br>with bitterness, envy and jealousy in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can receive deliverance but with an unforgiving spirit, you will lose it.
    <br>With that unforgiving spirit, envy and jealousy in your heart, that cannot be permanent.
    <br>This is why our life is epileptic.
    <br>It goes this way; later down.
    <br>This way - down.
    <br>And you keep asking yourself why all this is not with you forever.
    <br>It can be forever.
    <br>You are healed forever; you are blessed forever.
    <br>It is a paste-tense victory but because of an unforgiving spirit,
    <br>envy, jealousy, bitterness and hatred in you, that cannot be permanent.
    <br>As you are standing, begin to examine yourself, "What is wrong?
    <br>What is the next thing now?"
    <br>It is better not to receive than to receive and lose it.
    <br>Ask yourself, "What is wrong with me?
    <br>Why is my life not constant?
    <br>I'm happy now - another time...
    <br>I'm blessed - another time...
    <br>Why?"
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>His blessing is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>His healing is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>"Why all this?"
    <br>"Why?"
    <br>How can you labour, sweat and suddenly you are back to square one again?
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: BELIEVE AND CONFESS | PART 3
    <br>You are here today because you see the strength of God - from strength to strength.
    <br>That is why you are here - irrespective of tribulation, persecution, hatred.
    <br>Strength to strength - that is why you are here, irrespective of name-calling.
    <br>When you expect something to spoil and it is not spoiled, you will join them.
    <br>When you expect something to destroy and it refuses to destroy, you will join them.
    <br>When you expect something to disappear and it refuses to disappear, you will join them.
    <br>That is why you are here today.
    <br>Honestly examine your heart; Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Christianity lies in the heart".
    <br>You see this appearance - it is a camouflage.
    <br>Your make-up, your hair, your beauty, you are handsome -
    <br>this appearance is a camouflage; the real man is your heart.
    <br>This is why the Bible says faith is of man's heart.
    <br>The one that worships God is your heart, not your body.
    <br>Listen again!
    <br>Honestly examine your heart in the light of God's Word, without prejudice.
    <br>Honestly examine your heart and you will find that your heart is full of an unforgiving spirit,
    <br>bitterness, envy and jealousy.
    <br>"Forgive us as we forgive others" - is that not the promise?
    <br>"Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us."
    <br>So, why have an unforgiving spirit?
    <br>Why bitterness? Why envy? Why jealousy?
    <br>You are what God says you are. Why compare yourself to others?
    <br>Why measuring yourself with others?
    <br>Why?
    <br>"No, look, I'm too fat. I need to be slim. Look at that one - he is very slim."
    <br>You have gone to the car park; you have examined many cars there.
    <br>You say, "Ah, I see this car - I must get my own."
    <br>You would do anything to get your own.
    <br>Honestly examine your heart in the light of God's Word;
    <br>you will see a heart holding grudges, envy and jealousy.
    <br>Father, release Your children, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Release Your children, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Every unclean spirit in your career,
    <br>every unclean spirit in your life,
    <br>every unclean spirit - leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>God has spoken - rejoice!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I cover you with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>I seal you with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Be covered with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Begin a new life!
    <br>A new beginning!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>A new beginning is a new life,
    <br>a new direction,
    <br>a new way.
    <br>A new beginning!
    <br>A new beginning, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Someone was asking me four days ago,
    <br>"Sir, am I a real person God wants me to be?"
    <br>I asked, "What is the meaning of this grammar?
    <br>What do you mean by 'Am I a real person God wants me to be'?"
    <br>He said, "Because..." - he realised that he doesn't know how to go forward again.
    <br>He is a Christian.
    <br>"You said you are a Christian and you are saying this. This is blaspheming."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you want to be the person God wants you to be, if you want to know your destiny,
    <br>you need to know God better.
    <br>Get to know God better.
    <br>The way you know God - you know God by the senses, by your eyes.
    <br>"Yes, this is true."
    <br>"This is this; this is that."
    <br>By what you see, you know God; by what you hear, you know God;
    <br>by what you touch, you know God; feeling - you know God.
    <br>He was asking me, "What do I mean by knowing God better?"
    <br>I said, "You know God better - you know God by your senses".
    <br>He said, "Yes, yes".
    <br>"Ok, if you say you know God beyond your senses,
    <br>can you tell me - I'm here now - what are you looking at?"
    <br>He said, he sees T.B. Joshua, he sees my hand, my nose.
    <br>"No, no, no.
    <br>If you know people around me here, you know I'm a camouflage.
    <br>The face you are seeing is a camouflage."
    <br>To know the person God wants you to be, to know your destiny, you need to know God better.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[To know the person God wants you to be, to know your destiny, you need to know God better.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[To know the person God wants you to be, to know your destiny, you need to know God better.]
    <br>You know God - no doubt.
    <br>But you need to know God better.
    <br>You say, you know God.
    <br>By senses - what you see, hear - that is how you know God.
    <br>This is carrot, this is fruit, this is this, this is that.
    <br>Beyond this carrot - you cannot see beyond.
    <br>Beyond T.B. Joshua - you cannot see.
    <br>All you see is T.B. Joshua, he is holding a mic - that's all.
    <br>You need to know God better by discovering your spiritual gifts.
    <br>The Bible says no one can say "Jesus is Lord," except by the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>God is Spirit and His worshippers worship Him in Spirit and truth.
    <br>How can you worship God without the Spirit of God?
    <br>How can you know your destiny without the Spirit of God?
    <br>No one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Without your spiritual gift, you are zero.
    <br>Without your spiritual gift, you will continue to worship God by the senses -
    <br>what you see, what you hear, what you feel, what your emotions say, what your feelings say.
    <br>You cannot become God's person on the history and theory about the Word of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You cannot become God's person on the history and theory about the Word of God.
    <br>This is what makes you a child of God, a born again.
    <br>History and theory about the Word of God, that makes you - no!
    <br>You cannot become God’s person on the history and theory about the Word of God alone.
    <br>Indeed, it is valuable but alone - history and theory of the Bible -
    <br>you cannot just call your spiritual gift.
    <br>I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>God has spoken, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can sense God's healing touching you.
    <br>I can sense God's deliverance touching you, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Hear this: God has spoken!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Don't forget the message for you.
    <br>The spirit of unforgiveness, anger, bitterness breaks the communion with God,
    <br>breaks relationship with God
    <br>and once that relationship is broken, you are on your own.
    <br>Those spirits - malice, bitterness, envy, jealousy, hatred, unforgiveness -
    <br>you have this in your heart within you,
    <br>it opens the door to whatever you are facing, to whatever situation you are in.
    <br>Are you facing sickness, disease, whatever - it opens the door.
    <br>You don't need enemy to attack you; you have attacked yourself.
    <br>You know what it means when Jesus says, "Forgive them as you forgive those who trespassed against you".
    <br>With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves, heals and delivers.
    <br>Please, with pure heart!
    <br>This is why we gave you faith bracelets.
    <br>We have prayed over this; we put it on our altar before giving it to you
    <br>- just to take you from kindergarten, baby.
    <br>Things of the Spirit, you have to start from the foundation.
    <br>You start it on the outside, to remind you on the outside that you need to reset your belief.
    <br>Each time you sit down watching football on the television or whatever, it would be in your hand.
    <br>"Take more of me and give me more of You."
    <br>You would not know when you voice out, "Jesus!", instead of "Hey!"
    <br>Because "Hey!" is much of your language.
    <br>So you have to be pregnant of Jesus to shout "Jesus!"
    <br>We manifest what we possess.
    <br>Sometimes in the dream, when your wife, husband or children sleep,
    <br>side-by-side with you, in the night she would say, "My honey!"
    <br>- "What happened?"
    <br>- "It was a nightmare."
    <br>Because she is manifesting what she possesses; she possesses honey.
    <br>Even inside the vehicle when the vehicle is about to have an accident,
    <br>you say, "Hey!" - she/he is manifesting what she/he possesses.
    <br>You have to possess Jesus to manifest Jesus.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>This will help you:
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus..." - on the outside.
    <br>You need something to help you on the outside.
    <br>When you are alone, when you are about to sleep, you lie on the bed,
    <br>that is the last thing you would do before you sleep.
    <br>Just lie on the bed - "Jesus Christ, take more of me and give me more of You."
    <br>To flush out all this... - that is it.
    <br>You need that.
    <br>Let's pray for our nation.
    <br>Whatever you have with you as a contact, contact point.
    <br>Bless our nation, Lord.
    <br>Redeem our nation, Lord.
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Yes, God's intervention.
    <br>It's like every nation, every country today is facing challenges.
    <br>On the last day
    <br>Only true believers shall be raptured
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>On the last day
    <br>Only true believers shall be raptured
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to rebuke challenges, corruption, misjudge, misrule.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and pray.
    <br>Misjudge, misrule, killing, stealing, destruction.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Right now, pray for your leaders; ask God to redeem your leaders and put them on track.
    <br>Strengthen them with wisdom and understanding;
    <br>cover them with the blood of Jesus.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Listen once again: God has spoken.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The issue about your heart is a fundamental issue.
    <br>You have received all the deliverance here today, all the blessing here today,
    <br>breakthrough without a pure heart.
    <br>You will lose them.
    <br>It is a pure heart that maintains the blessing of God.
    <br>It is a pure heart that maintains God's blessing.
    <br>Maintenance is very important.
    <br>I know you have been delivered but don't forget your heart.
    <br>With a pure heart, man knows that Jesus saves, man knows that Jesus heals,
    <br>man knows that Jesus blesses.
    <br>There is no way you can maintain God's blessing without a pure heart.
    <br>So, we have to be serious.
    <br>Heart - the hearts I'm seeing are full of unforgiveness,
    <br>bitterness, envy, jealousy.
    <br>How can I continue to tell you this and yet, the hurt is still there.
    <br>Envy, jealousy, bitterness, hatred, unforgiving spirit.
    <br>A lot of people I'm seeing among the crowd, sitting down
    <br>still have that unforgiving spirit.
    <br>That shows that what is not permanent is not of God.
    <br>What is not done well is not done at all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So in this case, will you be ready when the Lord comes?
    <br>It could be tomorrow when you are not even here; you are home.
    <br>Will the Lord meet you?
    <br>Now, I'm leaving you in faith; will I meet you tomorrow in faith?
    <br>With unforgiving spirit?
    <br>I'm leaving you now in faith; will I meet you next Sunday with unforgiving spirit?
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>I'm leaving you now in faith, will I meet you next Sunday with bitterness in your heart?
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>So it is a waste.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Forget about miracle, deliverance - we are talking of soul.
    <br>You keep talking of your knowledge of the Scripture.
    <br>I know you have the knowledge but on the history, theory, about the Word of God.
    <br>That cannot save you alone.
    <br>On the history, theories, the Word of God - that cannot save you.
    <br>You can read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, quoting from verses to verses.
    <br>But yet, on the last day, you are in hell - hell fire.
    <br>We are doing this, having the history and theory about the Word of God
    <br>for the purpose of preaching and teaching.
    <br>To preach it - "Jesus is Lord!"
    <br>And teach it as a lecturer or whatever we call it.
    <br>This is the reason why we just have the history and theory of it.
    <br>We are only made spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>We are only made spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.
    <br>That's all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your calling and your spiritual gift are one.
    <br>You say, "What is my calling?"
    <br>Somebody says, "T.B. Joshua, what is my calling as a Christian?"
    <br>You ask me about your callling; what about your spiritual gift?
    <br>Your calling and your spiritual gift are one.
    <br>Your calling - you say, "What is my calling?"
    <br>"You are talking of your spiritual gift."
    <br>"What is my spiritual gift?"
    <br>"You are talking of your calling."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So the whole thing is mixed up.
    <br>So, please, I want to leave you. Thank you very much.
