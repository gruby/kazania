    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On Sunday, the 28th of July 2013, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message concerning an Asian nation -
    <br>warning them of an incident, involving a large aircraft, carrying over 200 people,
    <br>developing a fault soon after take off.
    <br>He subsequently prayed for the nation.
    <br>These were his words:
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>We have to pray!
    <br>This is an Asian country.
    <br>I will not mention any country but God showed me the country.
    <br>I am seeing a very big balloon.
    <br>What is the  cause of this?
    <br>It was just about to take off and the fault started.
    <br>It means that they can discover it on the tarmac but because of impatience.
    <br>If God gives me the grace, I will send a letter to the embassy of the country.
    <br>Check your airlines in your country.
    <br>It is going to be huge - almost 200 people inside.
    <br>What happened here is the fault of impatience
    <br>because there are many things they need to look into before they take off
    <br>but they are unable.
    <br>What is the cause?
    <br>Two hundred people are inside the plane.
    <br>This is an Asian country.
    <br>We are going to pray for them and I will see what I can do
    <br>to send a letter to the embassy and let them know
    <br>that they should inspect any plane on their tarmac before it moves.
    <br>Take cognisance, take note so that they can avert this.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
