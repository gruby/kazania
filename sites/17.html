  <p>    
    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Viewers all over the world, prepare your hearts to receive
    <br>and get ready to pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, God Almighty will take you from glory to glory.
    <br>Pray along in faith, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen to me.
    <br>Anywhere you are, right now from glory to glory.
    <br>Your career from glory to glory.
    <br>Your destiny from glory to glory.
    <br>Your life from glory to glory.
    <br>Your business from glory to glory.
    <br>Your marital life from glory to glory.
    <br>Your finances from glory to glory.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, it is not the will of God for you to be in that situation.
    <br>I declare you free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Glory!
    <br>Power!
    <br>Glory!
    <br>Power!
    <br>Glory!
    <br>Begin to receive the power of God!
    <br>Receive the power of God!
    <br>Glory!
    <br>Power!
    <br>Glory!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
