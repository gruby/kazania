    <br>MEGA LIVING WATER SERVICE!!!
    <br>Friday 27th September 2019
    <br>'He will lead them to the springs of living water.'
    <br>'And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.' Revelation 7:17
    <br>The Living Water is not tap water.
    <br>It has been affected by the Holy Spirit to break the yoke of affliction in your life.
    <br>Is your heart ready to receive the living presence of the divine power of God?
    <br>It is by grace you have been saved.
    <br>It is by grace you are going to receive this Living Water.
    <br>This means, this is not from yourself - it is the gift of God.
    <br>To receive this, you have to ask God for His mercy.
    <br>MEGA LIVING WATER SERVICE!!!

    <br>I was sitting in the class. All of a sudden, I couldn't see.
    <br>But the moment I came to take the Living Water,
    <br>I just ministered it on my eyes
    <br>and I looked up, everything I could see blurred...
    <br>Everything that was blurred is now clear.
    <br>I used to see my own parents blurred.
    <br>Now I can see them clearly.
    <br>I just looked up at the television
    <br>and what I used to squint my eyes to see before, I could see it clearly.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!

    <br>I come from China.
    <br>When I went to the doctors to check, I had a liver problem.
    <br>Now after vomiting, I feel free and very light.
    <br>God has healed me already. Thank God. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am healed. I am free. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I could not hear for the past 12 years with this ear.
    <br>Now I can hear to the glory of God.
    <br>I am so happy. I am so excited!
    <br>I just can't explain it.
    <br>Ever since I was born, 47 years ago, I do not know life without glasses!
    <br>I am so surprised!
    <br>As soon as I washed my eyes with the Living Water, I can see clearly.
    <br>I can't believe it! I can't believe that I am the one seeing clearly like this.
    <br>I was seeing people double or very blurry.
    <br>But now I see everyone clearly!

    <br>I had a shock. Since then, I was not able to hear.
    <br>Even my family, my wife know that I had the problem.
    <br>When I went to the Altar, after prayingr,
    <br>something came upon me; I started vomiting.
    <br>When I took the Living Water, I just put my hand in it
    <br>and dropped it in my ear three times.
    <br>It seemed as if I heard some kind of sound in my ear.
    <br>When I was coming out, it was like the speaker was very loud.
    <br>I said, "I can hear! I can hear everything!"
    <br>The air is clear.
    <br>I can see the cherubim waiting for you.
    <br>The blessing of Abraham is waiting for you!
    <br>Now it is your turn!
    <br>Get ready for the next Living Water service
