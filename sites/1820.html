    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There is a gentleman here - you bought a stolen good.
    <br>This has to do with a machine.
    <br>Recently you discovered that it is a stolen property, but you are afraid to return it.
    <br>You don't know what to do with it,
    <br>because they will trace it and you will be arrested.
    <br>To get out of it - you know the law concerning issues like this.
    <br>You will not be considered innocent.
    <br>It is the right time now. You should just take it to the Police station and explain yourself -
    <br>that you don't know anything about it; you are innocent.
    <br>This will be better.
    <br>Please, come out.
    <br>You have discovered that this thing was stolen. Come out.
    <br>This is not an issue.
    <br>The issue is that when you leave the church today, you may likely be arrested on Tuesday or Wednesday.
    <br>You recently found out that this is a stolen thing, but you cannot trace the guy.
    <br>You have not seen him for a long time now.
    <br>So please, come out right now.
    <br>If you come out, you will have freedom.
    <br>After the prayer, you will be counselled because you were ignorant; you did not know.
    <br>You did not know that this thing was stolen.
    <br>The receipt was prepared for you; everything was given to you.
    <br>There is no way that you could know, but it was only your heart that could tell you this.
    <br>So please, come out.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>You Bought STOLEN GOODS!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Charles Kenechukwu and I am a Nigerian.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave me last Sunday is 100% true.
    <br>The man of God said that there is gentleman here who bought a stolen good,
    <br>and he did not know that it was a stolen good.
    <br>Two weeks ago, I dealt with general goods - I bought anything that was movable in the market.
    <br>People that brought the market to us, brought the market to me.
    <br>I thought that this was just a normal business deal.
    <br>A week later, I had a call from one of my friends.
    <br>He told me that they had caught armed robbers in our area
    <br>and he mentioned somebody who mentioned my name, that I had bought that thing.
    <br>And I said, "Wow. How can this be possible?".
    <br>Within a minute, the owner of the market called me.
    <br>He heard that I was the one who bought everything that they had stolen from him.
    <br>I said, "No".
    <br>I rushed down to him,
    <br>and I confronted him and told him that I did not know.
    <br>He said that the matter was out of his hands, as he had reported it to the Police.
    <br>I was afraid. I did not know what to do.
    <br>I said, "How can I explain myself?", because I know the law of this country.
    <br>So I said, "I have a God that I serve".
    <br>I always watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I sleep with Emmanuel TV on.
    <br>So I rushed to The SCOAN.
    <br>In my petition I wrote, "Lord, please deliver me from this Police case".
    <br>During the mass prayer, when the man of God prophesied about this,
    <br>I said, "Is this real? Is this for me?".
    <br>I looked left and right to see whether anybody went forward, but nobody went forward.
    <br>So, I realised the prophecy was for me - of all people.
    <br>Then I went forward and I confirmed the prophecy.
    <br>When the man of God gave that prophecy, were you not surprised concerning that prophecy?
    <br>I was 100% surprised. I have never experienced this before.
    <br>Now you know the man of God, during the course of the prophecy,
    <br>he specifically mentioned that it was a part of a machine.
    <br>So tell us exactly what was the goods that you bought?
    <br>The goods that I bought was a motor battery.
    <br>So I confirm the prophecy.
    <br>I said, "Wow. This is for real".
    <br>This is how God answers prayers.
    <br>During the deliverance, the man of God looked straight at me and said that I am coming back for this testimony.
    <br>I said, "Ok, I claim it, in Jesus' name".
    <br>While I was still in Lagos, specifically on Tuesday around 11 am,
    <br>I had a call from my friend who said that the Police were looking for me.
    <br>They had gone to my shed, but I was not there.
    <br>I said, "Wow! What the man of God said is 100% true - that I would come for this testimony".
    <br>With that courage and boldness ...
    <br>You Bought STOLEN GOODS!!!
    <br>TB Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>When I left Lagos, I went back on Wednesday.
    <br>I went straight to the man, met with him and he was hostile towards me.
    <br>He said, "I am looking for my things".
    <br>You mean that you went back to the man that owned the goods,
    <br>that told you that the case was already with the Police?
    <br>Yes. I went back to him and he said that I should bring all those goods back,
    <br>that there is no cause for harm; that everything has been settled. Let me bring all the goods.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, prophecy brings solution to the glory of God.
    <br>My brother, are you not surprised at what the Lord has done in your life?
    <br>As I said, since I was born I have not experienced such a thing before.
    <br>I have seen it on Emmanuel TV and I always asked God, "When can I experience such a grace in my life?".
    <br>But today, I can testify that God is alive;
    <br>that The SCOAN is the real ministry that anyone can identify with.
    <br>As the Word of God says in Proverbs
    <br>that you must remind God ahead of your decision; He will show you the right path.
    <br>This advice is going to all businessmen - carry God along in everything that you are doing.
    <br>Don't say that this is a business opportunity -
    <br>the Bible says that what may seem right to you, may be wrong at the end.
    <br>All I have to say now is: Let all the businessmen carry God along, and in whatsoever you are doing,
    <br>know that there is Someone greater, smarter and more superior than you that is looking after you.
    <br>People of God, let us have faith in God.
    <br>As Jesus delivered me today, so He will deliver every one of us here today, in Jesus' mighty name we pray.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Put your hands together once again for Jesus.
    <br>We thank you very much for that advice
    <br>and we also want to advise you - like you rightly said -
    <br>the greatest decision you can make in life is to put God first in everything that you do.
    <br>And make sure that you make God's Word the standard for your life,
    <br>and carry God along in everything that you do and it shall be well with you, in Jesus' name.
