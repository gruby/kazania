  <p>    
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Wow. I want to salute you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I salute your faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Wow. Viewers all over the world, I won't forget what you want me to talk about.
    <br>I can never forget it.
    <br>I can never forget it at all.
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>You know that as your heart is in my heart,
    <br>the same way my heart - it is only you don't permit my heart in your heart.
    <br>Because of your complain now - you keep complaining.
    <br>There are a lot of things going on in your heart.
    <br>Hm, please, he should come and pray for me.
    <br>Don't worry. God is in control.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Well, last Sunday - how many of you came to the service last Sunday?
    <br>What a controversial service!
    <br>Will I call it like that?
    <br>Very controversial. That is to you.
    <br>The prophecy by itself was not controversial,
    <br>rather you, we - human beings.
    <br>The prophecy by itself was not controversial,
    <br>rather you, we - human beings.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>The prophecy by itself was not controversial at all, rather we - human beings.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>It is not my problem; what is controversial there.
    <br>We have seen the outcome of the election in the United States.
    <br>Having seen and heard, you would notice that the prophecy was all about the popular vote -
    <br>the vote of the majority of people - Americans.
    <br>In this case, we need the spirit of a prophet to understand, know and recognise
    <br>what the prophet was talking about.
    <br>You know our levels are different.
    <br>Do you agree with that?
    <br>I said our levels are different.
    <br>We are not on the same level.
    <br>Take not of that: Our levels are different and we are not of the same level.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That you have a very big cathedral, a huge bell and all kinds of activities
    <br>that are good by human standards,
    <br>remember, the human point of view is limited.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of 1 Corinthians and see what it says there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>1 Corinthians 1:25: "For the foolishness of God is wiser than human beings,
    <br>and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength."
    <br>That is, the foolishness of God, if there is, is wiser than that of man.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The weakness of God, if there is, is stronger than that of man.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is no shortcut to spiritual maturity
    <br>unless earthly understanding gives way to spiritual enlightenment.
    <br>Many people were trying to interpret Prophet on the basis of their own minds and ideas.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I quite understand the prophecy actually caused uproar
    <br>to many who gave it a different meaning and interpretation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't forget that politics, campaigns and elections in any democratic country are never about one person.
    <br>It is about the nation - the country we care for and love.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is about the country we care for and love, never about a person, the campaign and election.
    <br>If it is about the nation we care for and love, whatever happens,
    <br>we should accept the outcome and look to the future - Jesus, who is our future,
    <br>the Author and Finisher of our faith.
    <br>Don't forget, democracy is accommodation.
    <br>If democracy is accommodation, all democrats should value the process more than the product.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by process?
    <br>When I say look into the future - the Finisher and Author of our faith, that word is pregnant.
    <br>Who owns the future? - Jesus.
    <br>Jesus owns our future.
    <br>Whatever happens, we should accept it and look to the future.
    <br>Democracy is accommodation; it can accommodate anything.
    <br>You democrats should value the process more than the product.
    <br>I want to say to the nation of the United States, God bless you.
    <br>We will rise up and pray for the nation.
    <br>Whatever happens to that nation happens to the whole world.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Open your lips and ask God for the people of the United States and the world,
    <br>to accept the outcome and look to the future,
    <br>look to God - the Finisher and Author of our faith.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>To look to the future is to leave all to God; leave it for God.
    <br>Leave it for God and let's move on.
    <br>Since the logo of the United States is 'In God We Believe' - okay!
    <br>Say, In God We Believe!
    <br>If that is the logo - okay, let's look to God and leave the outcome.
    <br>Look to God and accept the outcome.
    <br>God bless you, United States. Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I show you some emails, you will be shocked.
    <br>Can you get me just one of those emails, out of thousands of emails.
    <br>Let them bring it.
    <br>People's faith...
    <br>It is true that in Africa, we have churches everywhere.
    <br>We have churches everywhere; every home is a church.
    <br>But that does not mean that we have more faith than other continents that don't have churches everywhere.
    <br>That we have churches everywhere does not mean that we have faith.
    <br>If I may say something to you: the prophecy I gave here last Sunday -
    <br>thousands of people went for fasting and prayer, telling God and crying.
    <br>I will show you one of their leaders.
    <br>Crying to God that "God, please hear our cry! We want this thing to change!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thousands. They did not hide it - they called and said, "Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Thank you. You have awoken us.
    <br>We heard your prophecy and immediately, we called each other.
    <br>Thousands or so went to the wilderness to fast and pray - naked - we prayed to God, 'Change this!'"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know, I don't want to talk too much. I just leave it.
    <br>You know, what I just told you about, I had just read it.
    <br>I will take one out of the thousand emails I received.
    <br>"Change this!"
    <br>They said, "Thank you. Your prophecy gave us a clue and guideline.
    <br>Change this, Lord! Help us, Lord!"
    <br>Fasting and prayer.
    <br>If I said to my brother here, "Hey, brother!
    <br>Two of you are looking for the position of chairman of the company.
    <br>But I'm seeing you being taken. Indeed, your name is on the table.
    <br>And the time to call you to become a chairman is in the next three days".
    <br>If the person, your second, heard me, maybe he is not in the church here but outside there sitting down,
    <br>maybe he is in another country and sees your face,
    <br>he may naked himself and say, "God, I want this position!
    <br>God, forgive me my sins - whatever I have done!"
    <br>Don't be surprised when he may be taken and you may not be taken.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>If two of you are looking for the position of a chairman of a company
    <br>and I call you out and say, "Oh, your paper is on the table now - right now!
    <br>The most qualified!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If the person that is also looking for that position is somewhere watching us,
    <br>don't surprised that if the person also has the heart of God,
    <br>he may naked himself that moment and say, "Lord, save this situation!
    <br>I am naked before You. Forgive me whatever I might have done.
    <br>Do it for me, Lord!"
    <br>Don't be surprised if you don't stand steadfast, his prayer may be answered.
    <br>That may not make a prophet a prophet of doom.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Have you found it? Give me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is one out of the cartons.
    <br>Maybe after this, I will ask them to bring all the emails out.
    <br>Not only the emails - their pictures are there.
    <br>It is not a fake email.
    <br>This is one out of thousands of emails.
    <br>I will show you the picture at a distance.
    <br>See the picture.
    <br>Do you see the picture?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Somebody who can read clearly, can you please help us to read this email
    <br>and you will be able to read it fluently.
    <br>Okay. Don't open the picture. Just read the email.
    <br>'America Saved Because Prophet Warned Us!' from Malta
    <br>Thursday, 10 November 2016
    <br>We love you, Prophet.
    <br>Thank you for helping save America.
    <br>Your word sent us into deep prayer, fasting and weeping for America.
    <br>God heard and spared us. Thank you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, you were not wrong; it was a strong warning.
    <br>Perhaps it is like Jonah who was to prophesy that Nineveh would be destroyed
    <br>because of their wickedness.
    <br>But the people repented and turned to God and prayed
    <br>and they were spared from the destruction that God had decreed.
    <br>We love you, Prophet.
    <br>Thank you for helping save America.
    <br>Your word sent us into deep prayer, fasting and weeping for America.
    <br>God heard and spared us. Thank you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, you were not wrong; it was a strong warning.
    <br>Perhaps it is like Jonah who was to prophesy that Nineveh would be destroyed
    <br>because of their wickedness.
    <br>But the people repented and turned to God and prayed
    <br>and they were spared from the destruction that God had decreed.
    <br>Christians, not only in the U.S. but in the whole world, prayed.
    <br>After hearing your prophecy, we cried, fasted and prayed from Sunday -
    <br>through 5am to Wednesday morning, to assure Trump would win.
    <br>Prophet, God heard our prayers.
    <br>We cried out to God for mercy and grace on America.
    <br>We need His guidance, not even influence. We fasted and prayed...
    <br>Okay, it is alright.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is one out of thousands.
    <br>Now, you know I read this thing twice.
    <br>The first one I read, I didn't want to mention it.
    <br>I said the person will win narrowly.
    <br>But the fear I have, which I said, is that the boat will be rocked.
    <br>And I said there will be challenges - great ones.
    <br>To 'rock the boat' means there will be crises.
    <br>Look - I'm just a servant.
    <br>That we will look at what God has written somewhere -
    <br>even sometimes, when God is not there, maybe God is not there,
    <br>you know when your master has written something on a paper,
    <br>and he is not there, maybe he is somewhere,
    <br>we servants sometimes run - "Oh!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And the person that has written it is not just a common person - he is a Dr, PhD, Professor and a Pastor.
    <br>He is a professor.
    <br>He is one of the leaders.
    <br>They said that what I saw was true but they were doubting it.
    <br>But they know my antecedent - my track record.
    <br>That when this man says something, it is like that oo! Ah!
    <br>Okay, what we were doubting before, this man has said it oo!
    <br>Let's go and die before God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>They said they will write a book - a full book - and send it to me.
    <br>I just laughed.
    <br>This is the power of prayer for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Just a servant.
    <br>Is it a crime to tell you what is before you?
    <br>It is not a crime to tell you, "Look, I'm seeing you there".
    <br>It is not a crime; it is a time to say, "Ey!"
    <br>and give your heart...
    <br>It is not a crime.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I remember one time - that was eight years ago.
    <br>I said there is a plane that will be leaving the tarmac.
    <br>I think the head of the aviation then - a very godly man -
    <br>in fact, I had not finished the service when he called.
    <br>He said, "Man of God, where? Is it this place? No plane will move for now till tomorrow".
    <br>I had to draw the mic because they said somebody was on the line.
    <br>I said, "Hello, sir".
    <br>He said, "This tarmac?
    <br>No no no - unless a plane that is coming. No plane will...
    <br>Is it the one coming or the one that will move?"
    <br>I said, "The one that will move".
    <br>He said, "From today till tomorrow afternoon, no plane will move".
    <br>And indeed - that happened just like that and nobody ever knew.
    <br>So, there are some people that have this...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us believe the power of prayer.
