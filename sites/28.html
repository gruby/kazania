    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Viewers all over the world, it is the will of God for you to be physically healed and spiritually saved.
    <br>Right now, as Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the viewers, join him in faith, in Jesus' name!
    <br>This is the moment God has chosen to deliver you, to free you, to release you.
    <br>Touch the screen and receive, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, now is the moment to release you, in whatever situation you are in.
    <br>It is God's will at this moment to free you, to release you, to deliver you.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, I command you to be free, in whatever situation you are in.
    <br>Jesus knows - He knows you, He knows your disposition.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>I can hear breakthrough in your health!
    <br>Breakthrough in you business!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough in your career!
    <br>Breakthrough in your marital life!
    <br>Breakthrough in your destiny!
    <br>Breakthrough in your finances!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to confess breakthrough in your business!
    <br>Confess breakthrough in your marital life!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Dry bones, rise again!
    <br>Confess breakthrough in your health!
    <br>Confess breakthrough in your marital life!
    <br>Are you facing divorce, crisis in the house?
    <br>Confess breakthrough!
    <br>I say breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>It is God's will at this moment to free you, to release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to confess breakthrough!
    <br>Confess it!
    <br>Breakthrough in my business!
    <br>Breakthrough in my finances!
    <br>Breakthrough in my marital home!
    <br>Breakthrough in my health!
    <br>What is the situation you are facing?
    <br>Are you sick?
    <br>Whatever sickness you are facing, whatever name they call it,
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot heal!
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot cure!
    <br>Right now, confess breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>The end has come to that trouble!
    <br>Enough is enough to that bondage, to that sickness, to that disease!
    <br>Enough is enough, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord! In Jesus Christ's name!
