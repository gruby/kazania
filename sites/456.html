  <p>    
    <br>One thing that should be clear to us:
    <br>When you are adopted by the Holy Ghost, you will know.
    <br>Before this, before that, adoption is number 1.
    <br>If you are adopted by the Holy Ghost,
    <br>then, when you are doing all this, you will know it is by the help of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>When you pray, you will know, this is what God has for you in store.
    <br>When to pray, how to pray, when to have an appointment with God - you will know all this.
    <br>But the problem we are facing now is that many of us are not adopted by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>When you are not adopted by the Holy Ghost and you are fasting,
    <br>it is like you are just fasting for yourself without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In the same vein, when you are not adopted by the Holy Ghost
    <br>and you are praying, it is like that prayer, you are just offering it by imagination.
    <br>"I'm seeing people praying, let me pray."
    <br>"My pastor said I should be pray, let me pray."
    <br>Not that you believe.
    <br>So that adoption is number 1; that is the fundamental.
    <br>Once this happened, you will know what you are doing.
    <br>But without adoption, you cannot know what you are doing -
    <br>when to pray, how to pray.
    <br>If you don't believe and you pray, who are you praying to?
    <br>When you are not adopted by the Holy Ghost, whatever you are doing,
    <br>for God's sake, you will do it because you see others doing it.
    <br>You will pray because you see others praying.
    <br>You will fast because you have problems.
    <br>When you are adopted by the Holy Ghost, you will do those things
    <br>under the supervision of the Holy Ghost, God.
    <br>The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 12 that
    <br>no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>No one can say, "Jesus is Lord", except you are adopted.
    <br>This is what I'm talking about.
    <br>No one can say, "In the name of Jesus" genuinely.
    <br>That does not mean, people will not say, "In the name of Jesus";
    <br>people will say it, even without belief.
    <br>But the Bible is talking of the genuineness of that.
    <br>Those who really say it in truth and faith.
    <br>This is what the Bible refers to.
    <br>Those who really say that in truth and faith.
    <br>There are two Christians:
    <br>one Christian with idea - this is religious Christianity.
    <br>They are people that pray because they have a problem;
    <br>not because they believe.
    <br>They fast and pray because they have a problem.
    <br>They fast and pray because their pastor asked them to fast and pray.
    <br>They fast and pray because they are brought up in a Christian home.
    <br>That you are brought up in a Christian home does not mean that you are adopted by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>They can preach, they have the knowledge of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
    <br>Fine.
    <br>That is Christianity as a religion.
    <br>But there is Christianity, a Christian like Christ Himself.
    <br>Jesus Christ came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.
    <br>That is His mission.
    <br>If you are really adopted by the Holy Ghost,
    <br>you will pray because you believe; you will pray at His will.
    <br>Which Christian are you?
    <br>Christian by religion - Christian by the Holy Ghost, under the supervision of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Please, state it clear.
    <br>One must be adopted by the Holy Ghost to be a Christian in truth and in faith,
    <br>in truth and in Spirit.
    <br>One must be adopted in order to be a Christian.
    <br>To be a Christian in truth and Spirit, one must be adopted
    <br>and your adoption must not be questionable but be genuine.
    <br>The Bible says God is Spirit
    <br>and those who worship Him, worship Him in truth and Spirit.
    <br>One must be adopted to worship God in Spirit and truth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[One must be adopted to worship God in Spirit and truth.]
    <br>One must be adopted by the Holy Ghost to worship God in Spirit and truth.
    <br>I can't hear you. Once again.
    <br>[One must be adopted by the Holy Ghost to worship God in Spirit and truth.]
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is not possible to worship God in Spirit and truth without the adoption by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>If you are not adopted by the Holy Ghost and you worship God -
    <br>fine, you will worship God as mental assent, idea, what you read,
    <br>what you hear, what others tell you, what is going on around you -
    <br>that is religion.
    <br>That is what religious people depend on.
    <br>They depend on what they read
    <br>and the Bible says, we have to examine what we read in the light of God's Word.
    <br>What is the light in God's Word? The Holy Ghost.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is that light.
    <br>You must beam the light when you read.
    <br>"Ey, Jerusalem, Bethlehem" - don't go by that, beam light.
    <br>Let the light of God beam on it to give you because the Bible says,
    <br>God's Word refreshes our mind.
    <br>God's Spirit renews our strength.
    <br>Can you see the two?
    <br>It means, God's power working through His Word and Spirit
    <br>to bring about you as a Christian.
    <br>"Be healed, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>If the person is healed, it is God's power working through His Word and Spirit
    <br>to bring about that healing.
    <br>"Be delivered, in Jesus' name!" and the person is delivered.
    <br>"Thank God, I'm delivered!"
    <br>What brought about that deliverance?
    <br>It is God's power working through His Word and Spirit to bring about that deliverance.
    <br>Coming to the ministers of God.
    <br>You are adopted by the Holy Ghost; that is why you are a pastor.
    <br>You are adopted by the Holy Ghost; that is why you are a bishop.
    <br>You are adopted by the Holy Ghost; that is why you are a prophet.
    <br>So there must be an adoption; you must be adopted to become that whom you are.
    <br>No one will come out and say, "I'm a lawyer" - you must graduate and go to a seminar
    <br>for a year before you can be approved to go on the bar.
    <br>If not, you will be arrested because there is a council there for that.
    <br>So also, after you have read your Bible, after you have listened to the Word of God,
    <br>after you have fasted, after you have prayed,
    <br>after whatever you have done in your Christian life,
    <br>you must be adopted by the Holy Ghost before you can say,
    <br>"I'm a pastor; I'm a Christian".
    <br>That adoption is where Jesus is waiting for us.
    <br>You can't play any game there; no human hand can help you.
    <br>No godfather can help you; no one can help you with that; it's only Him.
    <br>You can't ring yourself to be adopted.
    <br>There is no human being you will know in this world that will help you to do that
    <br>but they can help you to know the Word of God;
    <br>they can also help you to have the vast knowledge from Genesis to Revelation.
    <br>They can help you.
    <br>You can stay with a man of God to know everything about the setup of a church
    <br>and preach the Word and teach the Word and people will see that this man is grounded with the Word.
    <br>Yes, but to be adopted, no human being can help you.
    <br>God's grace can do that.
    <br>That is the confirmation; that makes you a Christian,
    <br>that makes you a pastor - adoption.
    <br>And this adoption does not come because you are a pastor's son
    <br>or you are brought up from a Christian home
    <br>or your name is Peter or Joshua
    <br>or you sleep in the church 24/7
    <br>or you have a PhD or doctorate degree in theology
    <br>or you sleep inside the bush, in the wilderness throughout
    <br>or you depend on honey and locusts only
    <br>or you don't talk to people, you just decide to keep to yourself.
    <br>When they call you - "Hm, don't push me to sin!"
    <br>Self-righteousness cannot bring about that.
    <br>The adoption comes by the grace of God.
    <br>That is why you suddenly see someone that has never been to the wilderness
    <br>will suddenly become a great minister of God,
    <br>whilst someone who has been sleeping in the wilderness will remain in the wilderness there.
    <br>That is why there is envy and jealousy because of, "Why not me?
    <br>I have been in the wilderness for many years".
    <br>"Why not me? I was brought up from a Christian home."
    <br>"Why not me? I'm an author of the Bible."
    <br>So this actually brings about envy and jealousy.
    <br>"Why not me? I have eloquence; I can preach powerful messages."
    <br>"Why not me? I have that what it takes to convince people."
    <br>"Why not me?"
    <br>You can convince people but you cannot convert people.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit that converts.
    <br>It is all about adoption; your Christianity is all about adoption.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My Christianity is all about adoption by the Holy Spirit".
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>[My Christianity is all about adoption by the Holy Spirit.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[My Christianity is all about adoption by the Holy Spirit.]
    <br>Yes, it is all about adoption by the Holy Ghost. That's all.
    <br>In whichever way the Holy Spirit may choose.
    <br>In many cases, you have this knowledge of teaching and preaching before adoption.
    <br>In many other cases, you may be adopted;
    <br>after adoption, He will be the one to teach you how to teach and preach the Word.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>And in some cases, after your adoption, this may actually come.
    <br>He does as He likes.
    <br>Your prayer in the past, meeting ministers of God,
    <br>a lot of ministers you have met, a lot of deliverance they have done for you,
    <br>a lot of blessing and breakthrough they have done
    <br>and you may not see any result.
    <br>But the outcome of those prayers brought you here today.
    <br>If you had not received those prayers, I would not be able to meet you today.
    <br>How can anybody say those prayers are wasted?
    <br>I know, they are not wasted.
    <br>They are not.
    <br>In your spirit, begin to change your confession.
    <br>Those prayers are not wasted.
    <br>Hallelujah.
