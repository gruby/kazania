    503 - The MOST IMPORTANT Message You May Ever Hear!!!
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Good Morning, Mexico!
    <br>Better is not good enough; the best is yet to come!
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Mexico, your time has come!
    <br>It is an honour and a great privilege to present this night the Prophet of God, T.B. Joshua,
    <br>world-renowned pastor and the General Overseer of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations -
    <br>a global Christian organisation with its headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Every six out of ten people that visit Nigeria, go to The SCOAN.
    <br>He is also the founder of Emmanuel TV, a global television station with more than 50 million viewers.
    <br>Recently, because of his contribution to humanity,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was included in the Society For The Recognition Of Famous People
    <br>with only six thousand names, including icons like Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein and Graham Bell
    <br>with many others.
    <br>The anointing we honour is the anointing that blesses.
    <br>Let's honour God and His Prophet.
    <br>Let's put our hands together as we welcome Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the man of God that God has raised to bless our country.
    <br>Welcome, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for the life of this man.
    <br>Bless God for the life of His servant.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Yesterday, we got somewhere - I think we shall continue where we stopped.
    <br>Once again, I love you.
    <br>Say to your neighbour, "I love you".
    <br>I can't hear you; I love you!
    <br>Don't forget, it is a prophetic word.
    <br>You may see it as mere, 'I love you'. 
    <br>No, this is a word from the heart.
    <br>It needs to be said to God.
    <br>First, 'I love You, God',
    <br>then, 'I love You, my neighbour'.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This message shall be taken from the Book of Galatians 5; we take our reading from verse 1.
    <br>And when you get home, take your time to read from the beginning to the end.
    <br>Freedom in Christ.
    <br>"So Christ has truly set us free.
    <br>Now make sure that you stay free.
    <br>And don't get tied up again in slavery to the law.
    <br>I, Paul tell you this,
    <br>if you commit, counting on circumcision,
    <br>to make you right with God,
    <br>then Christ will be of no benefit.
    <br>I will say it again.
    <br>If you are trying to find favour with the Lord,
    <br>by being circumcised,
    <br>you must obey every regulation
    <br>in the whole law."
    <br>Let's go to verse 6.
    <br>That will be our proof text today.
    <br>"For where we place our faith,
    <br>in Christ Jesus,
    <br>there is no benefit in being circumcised,
    <br>or being uncircumcised,
    <br>what is important is faith expressing itself in love."
    <br>This is the voice of Paul.
    <br>Paul emphatically stated in Galatians 5:6,
    <br>that faith works by love.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 13:13;
    <br>faith, hope and love.
    <br>Among them the greatest is love.
    <br>We talk about love.
    <br>My brothers and sisters today,
    <br>the possession of both faith and love
    <br>can only motivate us,
    <br>can only energise us,
    <br>can only make you act with God.
    <br>Not just love, not just faith.
    <br>The possession of both faith and love will motivate us to do what?
    <br>To walk with God.
    <br>It will motivate us to look around
    <br>to see those who are in need of your strength,
    <br>those who are in need of your love.
    <br>Not only faith.
    <br>The possession of both faith and love will motivate you
    <br>to look around and see those who are in need,
    <br>who are in need of all good things
    <br>the Lord has given you -
    <br>your love,
    <br>your strength,
    <br>your finances,
    <br>just every good thing.
    <br>You want to act with God.
    <br>The possession of both faith and love will give you this grace.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Your love for Christ does not give up in the face of crisis.
    <br>In the face of situations, your love for Christ sees you through.
    <br>One can be poor and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>One can be sick in body, yet be a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because of the love of God.
    <br>God is love.
    <br>He who abides in love abides in God
    <br>and God abides in him.
    <br>Don't let your situation mislead you.
    <br>That you are a pastor or a Christian does not mean you cannot be sick.
    <br>That you are a pastor or a Christian does not mean you cannot face a situation.
    <br>Our situation makes us stronger.
    <br>Our situation improves us, it doesn't impair us.
    <br>The possession of faith and love motivates you
    <br>when there is no money in the pocket.
    <br>The possession of faith and love motivates you
    <br>when there is no food on the table.
    <br>Our walking with the Lord
    <br>are in both good and hard times.
    <br>When you are in a hard time,
    <br>and you do not possess love,
    <br>you cannot move forward.
    <br>Only love can see us through.
    <br>If you don't have love, your faith is not going to work.
    <br>That is why some of us find it difficult to make use of our faith.
    <br>That is why some of us today claim to be Christians
    <br>have a hard time using their faith.
    <br>You say, "Have faith in God".
    <br>It means, the possession of faith and love.
    <br>Love is an equalizer.
    <br>It is good for both the rich and the poor.
    <br>That is love.
    <br>It does not impose itself on anyone.
    <br>It does not insult people.
    <br>I love you once again.
    <br>Say to your neighbour, "I love you".
    <br>I can't hear you. Say, "I love you".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I love you".
    <br>Once again, "I love you".
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>What we are doing as Christians
    <br>is just a reflection of the relationship we have with Jesus.
    <br>Once again,
    <br>what we are doing as Christians
    <br>is just a reflection of the relationship we have with Jesus.
    <br>It is just a reflection.
    <br>When you point a torch - look, this is a reflection of the light.
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do
    <br>but the relationship we keep.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Whatever your profession,
    <br>'are you a pastor?',
    <br>whatever your profession,
    <br>as a Christian,
    <br>take note,
    <br>flows out of the relationship you have with God.
    <br>Whatever your profession,
    <br>flows out of the relationship you have with Jesus.
    <br>What I'm doing now
    <br>flows out of the relationship I maintain with Jesus.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>If I want to do more
    <br>and I feel what I'm doing is little, and I want more,
    <br>I need to maintain a great relationship.
    <br>Once again,
    <br>if I feel what I am doing is little,
    <br>and I need more from God,
    <br>I need to maintain a great relationship.
    <br>We call it a 'love relationship'.
    <br>Christianity is not a religion but a relationship.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Many people miss it.
    <br>They practise some teachings religiously without relationship.
    <br>Love cannot exist without relationship.
    <br>Because of that, we call it a love relationship.
    <br>Love cannot exist without a relationship.
    <br>If you love Jesus,
    <br>you need to read His precious Book
    <br>because Jesus and His Word are one.
    <br>You say you love Jesus.
    <br>Today, when we have passion or desire, we say we love that thing.
    <br>We can't call passion or desire for something love.
    <br>The reason why Christianity today is facing challenges,
    <br>is because people have passion, desire for Jesus, encounters with Jesus,
    <br>still yet, they don't love Jesus.
    <br>If you have passion for Jesus,
    <br>desire for Jesus,
    <br>you have an encounter because we pray for you and you are healed,
    <br>you say, "Jesus is my Lord". That is not enough.
    <br>When you have passion for something,
    <br>that thing is like a hobby, a game.
    <br>When people say, "I love football", I say, "No, the word, 'love' is wrong.
    <br>'I have passion for the game' ".
    <br>You have desire for it.
    <br>Love is the greatest.
    <br>It is not a misused word.
    <br>Love for Christ.
    <br>If you have love for Christ,
    <br>that love will never give up in the face of persecution.
    <br>When there is no money in the pocket,
    <br>it is that love that will keep you going.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I told you yesterday that Jesus loves me,
    <br>not because I'm good
    <br>or I'm better than anyone of you,
    <br>He loves me and you
    <br>because He is love.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>He is love.
    <br>It is simple.
    <br>Jesus loves me
    <br>not because I am good
    <br>or I'm better than anyone else,
    <br>He loves me and you
    <br>because God is love.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>If you say you love Jesus,
    <br>how often do you read His precious Book?
    <br>Because the more you read His precious Book, the more you love Him.
    <br>If you really love Jesus,
    <br>you deliberately create more time
    <br>reading His Book,
    <br>meditating on each Word you read,
    <br>turning it over and over in your heart.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Yes - each time I listen to the song, "Oh, how I love Jesus"...
    <br>How much do you love Jesus?
    <br>Let me ask you a question.
    <br>How often do you say, "God bless you!" to your neighbour?
    <br>How often?
    <br>How many times today have you said to your neighbour,
    <br>"God bless you"?
    <br>That is a little way you can bless your neighbour
    <br>because our life is measured
    <br>by how much we love God and our neighbour.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>How often do you say, "God bless you" to your neighbour?
    <br>How often do you greet your neighbour, "Good Morning"?
    <br>Or how often do you genuinely, sincerely smile at your neighbour?
    <br>Smile to your neighbour!
    <br>Please, look at your neighbour and smile genuinely, sincerely.
    <br>I can't see you! Smile!
    <br>Genuinely.
    <br>Sincerely!
    <br>For Christ's sake.
    <br>Out of the abundance of the heart,
    <br>I'm not saying the stomach!
    <br>Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
    <br>"God bless you!" is from the heart!
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Laugh at your neighbour!
    <br>It shows there is joy within.
    <br>Right now, begin to build it.
    <br>Jesus wanted Peter and us for that matter to learn this.
    <br>Smile to your neighbour.
    <br>Smile at your neighbour.
    <br>Jesus wanted Peter and us for that matter to learn this.
    <br>If you hope to accomplish your goal,
    <br>love - "I love you".
    <br>Love - "I love You, Lord".
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Before I finally leave you and move because my heart is going in another direction,
    <br>let us love one another.
    <br>Love comes from Jesus.
    <br>Whoever does not love
    <br>does not know God.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>You say, "I am a Christian"
    <br>but you cannot love your neighbour.
    <br>You say, "I am a Christian!"
    <br>but you stand on the pulpit and begin to condemn,
    <br>condemning other religions,
    <br>condemning your neighbour.
    <br>Love has a language
    <br>that transcends all languages,
    <br>all barriers,
    <br>all distances.
    <br>No wonder we are here today in oneness,
    <br>sharing the Good News of our Lord, Jesus Christ,
    <br>irrespective of differences in race and tribes.
    <br>Irrespective of differences in languages, race and tribes. That is love for you.
    <br>If you don't love,
    <br>God cannot entrust any grace on you.
    <br>If you have that grace to heal and deliver,
    <br>without love, you will misuse that grace.
    <br>You will pray for this one,
    <br>and say, "This one is not a Christian, I will not pray for him".
    <br>"This one is my enemy, I will not pray for him."
    <br>Without love, no grace.
    <br>A person who loves will enjoy the grace of God.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Love has eyes.
    <br>Love has eyes to see hope,
    <br>I mean, what sinners can be by the grace of God.
    <br>That is love.
    <br>What the poor can be by the grace of God.
    <br>What the sick person can be...
    <br>When the "love person" looks at the sick person,
    <br>he wants to help because he knows what he can be by grace.
    <br>That is love.
    <br>Love.
    <br>Failing to preach love
    <br>will continue to cause disunity in the Body of Christ.
    <br>Failing to preach love will continue causing disunity,
    <br>conflicts between people.
    <br>The Lord said, "Let My people be one, My Church".
    <br>Finally,
    <br>because of love,
    <br>I can see the sick there.
    <br>Because of love,
    <br>I can see the poor sitting.
    <br>Because of love,
    <br>the dejected, I see them sitting there.
    <br>I will locate them.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Once again, our lives are measured
    <br>by how much love for Jesus and our neighbours.
    <br>The most important aspect of our lives to God is love.
    <br>If God looks at you, what values to Him most is love.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I love you once again.
    <br>I love Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"I love Jesus".
    <br>"I love you".
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>God bless His Word.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Now, we are leaving here to meet the sick,
    <br>and to meet the need.
    <br>With the possession of faith and love,
    <br>I will be able to do it,
    <br>to give them their need.
    <br>With the possession of faith and love in me,
    <br>I will be able to give them their need -
    <br>healing,
    <br>deliverance,
    <br>and freedom.
    <br>The possession of faith and love.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>When love fills your heart,
    <br>there is no place for fear.
    <br>Love is an enemy of fear.
    <br>Take note.
    <br>Mexico Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>There are many fears -
    <br>fear of loss,
    <br>fear of false accusation,
    <br>fear of failure,
    <br>fear of sickness,
    <br>fear of limitation.
    <br>When love fills your heart,
    <br>fear has no place in your life!
    <br>Love is an enemy of fear.
    <br>I love You, God!
    <br>I love you, my neighbour!
    <br>I love God!
    <br>I love my neighbour!
    <br>These words need to be said to God,
    <br>often and often,
    <br>I love You, God!
    <br>I love you, my neighbour
    <br>over and over and over again!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
