    <br>I know your song is always in your heart - 'Sin's Power'.
    <br>Can we rise up and sing?
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus rose I rose
    <br>When He rose we rose
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went I went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>That is your secret.
    <br>Sin's power - you know what sin brings.
    <br>When you say, "Sin's power over me", it means tribulation, affliction, setback -
    <br>just mention any foolish thing - broken!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You must mean it when you sing it.
    <br>This is what you should sing before sleeping.
    <br>And when you are going, this should be in your heart.
    <br>Meditation.
    <br>As you are looking at me, that song should be going on in your heart.
    <br>It should go on in your heart.
    <br>It is well anointed to secure you for the glory.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>If God's Word finds its place in your heart, let me see your joy.
    <br>That is why we are here; that is the most important thing -
    <br>God's Word must find its place in your heart.
    <br>God's Word in your heart heals, blesses, saves, brings Jesus to the scene.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God's Word in my heart".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[God's Word in my heart.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[God's Word in my heart.]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[God's Word in my heart.]
    <br>Listen to that word 'heart' because Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Heart - the real man, the man himself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Heart".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Heart.]
    <br>Face your neighbour.
    <br>Heart - the real man, the man himself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Not, "Lord I want to be like Jesus in my face".
    <br>Your face can be oblong or round; that is not an issue.
    <br>You must be like Jesus in your heart.
    <br>That is why faith is of man's heart because only faith pleases God.
    <br>See what you have been doing since morning.
    <br>Prayer is a work of faith; fasting is a work of faith.
    <br>Humility is a work of faith; faithfulness is a work of faith.
    <br>Kindness is a work of faith; obedience is a work of faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>The real man - the man himself.
    <br>If I'm talking to you and not your heart, I'm not talking to you.
    <br>When you are talking to me not from your heart, I will not be able to help you.
    <br>If what you are saying is not from your heart, I will not be able to help you.
    <br>I'm a man of heart; I must talk to the man of heart.
    <br>Heart! Heart!
    <br>Heart to heart!
    <br>Are you here - your heart, your real man?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you here - your heart?"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Are you here - your heart?]
    <br>Our presence here today is all about identification -
    <br>to identify and acknowledge our weakness.
    <br>To identify and acknowledge our weakness is victory itself.
    <br>You say, "Ah, I'm here because I'm a smoker".
    <br>"I'm here because I'm a liar."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"I'm here because I'm a thief."
    <br>To identify and acknowledge your weakness is victory itself.
    <br>Take note - it is 50 percent of the victory.
    <br>"I'm a smoker; I don't want to smoke any longer.
    <br>Jesus, help me. That is why I'm here.
    <br>I don't want to smoke any longer."
    <br>It is 50 percent of the victory; the remaining 50 percent, leave it for God.
    <br>Right now, begin to identify where you need to improve.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Where do you need to improve?"
    <br>Whatever blessing you have received in terms of miracle or healing cannot be permanent;
    <br>it is our weakness that robs us.
    <br>That is what satan will use to take away the blessing you have received.
    <br>That weakness is the route satan will take to snatch away the blessing you have received.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Where do you need to improve?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour again.
    <br>[Where do you need to improve?]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Where do you need to improve?]
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>[Where do you need to improve?]
    <br>Where do you need to improve in order to have a permanent miracle, a miracle forever?
    <br>If not, your life will continue to be epileptic - up, down.
    <br>Yesterday, you were once rich; today, you are on the street.
    <br>Yesterday, you were once healthy; today, you are very sick.
    <br>Satan uses our weakness as a route to get us, to snatch the one we have from God.
    <br>You know what it means: when you were alright yesterday and today is the opposite.
    <br>You lived at peace yesterday; but today - opposite.
    <br>You know what it means.
    <br>There is a song you sing.
    <br>It shall be permanent
    <br>What the Lord has done for me
    <br>It shall be permanent
    <br>No, it cannot be permanent if you don't block that weakness - the route satan uses to get to you.
    <br>He uses that route to get to you - the route, your weakness.
    <br>It is the route, road satan uses to get to you.
    <br>Identify where you need to grow, where you need to improve.
