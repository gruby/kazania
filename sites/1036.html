  <p>    
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us -Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is with us...
    <br>People of God, my name is Obioha Chubuikem. I am from Olo in Imo State.
    <br>The woman beside me is the woman God used to connect me, it was the woman
    <br>that came here and brought me the Morning Water. The next woman beside her is my mother.
    <br>And the old man sitting?
    <br>And the man sitting down is my uncle. 
    <br>- And the other brother standing?
    <br>And the last one is my cousin brother because my dad is late.
    <br>Now share with us your testimony.
    <br>In the year 2011 I was a student of Ebonyi State University in the Department of Medicine and Surgery.
    <br>When I was there, there was a boy in the school who was also a microbiology student -
    <br>so the boy was a cultist and was trying to lure me into cultism, which I refused.
    <br>He tried to persuade me to join cultism - I refused.
    <br>He tried in several ways to make sure that I concurred but I refused.
    <br>Then the boy said that as long as I refuse to join him to be cultist, he was going to deal with me -
    <br>as long as I was in Ebonyi State University, precisely Abakaliki.
    <br>So there was an issue that arose in the school.
    <br>There was a fight that arose in the school and someone was murdered.
    <br>And the person that was murdered is like an adopted son to the Vice Chancellor of Ebonyi State University.
    <br>So when the incident took place, the boy went to the Vice Chancellor of Ebonyi State
    <br>and told the man that I am the one responsible for the deceased, what led to the deceased's death.
    <br>So when the incident happened, I was in my hostel.
    <br>The police came to the hostel and arrested me, and arrested some other hostel inmates.
    <br>So then, I was taken to the police divisional station; from police station I was transferred to the state CID
    <br>which is in Abakaliki Metropoly. So there I was. Then, after some investigation, some other
    <br>seven people were later released based on no case submission.
    <br>So there I was, until they now took my matter to the magistrate court.
    <br>The chief magistrate court said that the matter is a capital offence,
    <br>that it was beyond magistrate court and therefore, he remanded me to prison.
    <br>And the matter was to be taken to high court for further hearing.
    <br>So then, I was taken to Abakaliki Prison. That was were I was since 2011.
    <br>I was in Abakaliki  Prison since 2011, 2012, 2013.
    <br>I was going for trial.
    <br>Each and every day I had a court date, the black vehicle would come to the gate,
    <br>I would enter black vehicle, cuffed hands and legs.
    <br>And I would be taken to the high court.
    <br>Because the person trying my case was the chief justice of Ebonyi state.
    <br>November 28, 2014 was the day of the judgement.
    <br>So the day of the judgement they came to the prison and took me to the court.
    <br>Then the judge said that based on the evidence surrounding this my case, he hereby found me guilty of this offence.
    <br>And by the power conferred on him as a chief justice of Ebonyi State
    <br>he hereby sentenced me to death, to die by hanging.
    <br>So from there, they took me to prison, where I could get some of my belongings.
    <br>Then they handcuffed me and I entered into the black vehicle. They took me from Abakaliki medium prison,
    <br>and now transferred me to Enugu maximum prison because that is where they used to keep
    <br>those that are being condemned to death.
    <br>There I was in Enugu maximum prison, awaiting for the day of execution.
    <br>Then, there I lost hope. I had no one.
    <br>Because since I was facing trial in Abakaliki, I have lost everything. My dad is late.
    <br>My uncle - they have spent so much money, millions of naira,
    <br>to make sure that I was discharged and set free from the high court.
    <br>But at the end of the day, all of their efforts seemed to be aborted.
    <br>All their efforts were only in vain.
    <br>After I have been sentenced to death and I transferred to the maximun prison
    <br>waiting for execusion, they all lost hope that I would ever come out; it was as if I was already gone forever.
    <br>So there I was; I had nothing to do, I was just crying saying: "God, how could this happen to me?
    <br>I am innocent of this matter, I never committed any crime.
    <br>Just that someone wants me to suffer because he feels that every power belongs to him."
    <br>So there I was in Enugu maximum prison. So there was a day I was in the cells,
    <br>then they opened the cell door, they called me out.
    <br>There was prison chapel inside the prison yard.
    <br>So I went to church. When I got inside the church, I looked at the screen, I saw Emmanuel Television.
    <br>When I saw Emmanuel Televison, I started watching Emmanuel Television
    <br>seeing what they were doing and I was seeing some prisoners outside, they came here
    <br>to testify how they with the help of the Morning Water were set free from the prison.
    <br>Then I said that if the man of God could do this for other people abroad,
    <br>then me here in Nigeria - I believed, the man of God would also do it for me.
    <br>So after I had meditated this within my mind, they took me back to the cell where I was.
    <br>In my cell, I was still praying telling God of Prophet T.B. Joshua: "Help me."
    <br>But the problem was - who would come here to plead my case here?
    <br>I had nobody; my own mother could not afford 50 naira to enter transport, talk less of going there.
    <br>So I was wondering what to do: "God, how am I going to reach Emmanuel TV or Prophet T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>This woman beside me is an evangelist. She is into prison ministry.
    <br>She comes to prisons; she goes to where prisoners sentenced to death are being kept.
    <br>She ministers the Word of God to them, tells them to repent and give their life to Christ before their execution.
    <br>So there I was, when this woman came, she met me.
    <br>She asked me what was my name and what was I doing here.
    <br>I told her that I am Obioha Chikuikem and what brought me here.
    <br>She asked me, if I had committed. I said I did not do anything,
    <br>I was just here for the sake that I had no one to help me out.
    <br>The woman said that it was ridiculous.
    <br>She said there was no problem. She prayed for me so that I should not worry,
    <br>that one day I would go out of prison. I said 'amen'.
    <br>Then I called her saying: "Mama, please, there is something I want you to help me to do.
    <br>Please I don't know. Can you do that for me?"
    <br>She said: "What is that?
    <br>I said: "What I want you to do for me - do you know of Prophet T.B. Joshua? Synagogue?
    <br>She said she knows about it, she has been there once.
    <br>I said: "Please, madam, I want you to go to the Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>Go there, tell Prophet T.B. Joshua that there is someone here who has been sentenced to death
    <br>to die by hanging. I am just waiting for execution, I don't know when the day is going to be.
    <br>That I want him to pray for me, so that I will get out of this place
    <br>because I did nothing to deserve to die unnecessarily."
    <br>So the woman said that if that was I want she is going to do it for me.
    <br>So the woman asked me where am I coming from, because she is from Enugu state.
    <br>I didn't know her before. I have not come in contact before.
    <br>That was my first time of seeing her while I was in death row.
    <br>So then I told her where I am coming from - I am from Olo in Imo State.
    <br>She said that I should give her my address.
    <br>I directed her my address. She travelled from Enugu and went to my place and met my mother.
    <br>When she went to my place, she saw my mother. She told my mother who she was,
    <br>then she asked my mother to give her some of my pictures and other things -
    <br>that she wanted to take them somewhere.
    <br>Then my mother concurred and at the end of the day she came to the Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>Some weeks later she brought this Morning Water and this booklet and this.
    <br>Then when she brought this, she advised me on how to be ministering it every morning when I wake up.
    <br>I said: "Ok, thank you very much."
    <br>I believed that with these I would be set free and go out of this place based on the power of God in Prophet T.B.Joshua.
    <br>I would be delivered, as far I was innocent of this offense unless I was guilt of this offense.
    <br>But if I was innocent of this offense I must surely go out of this place.
    <br>And we can see how emotional the brother is right now. He is telling us his ordeals.
    <br>How he was on the death row as a result of a case against him that he murdered someone
    <br>while he was in school. And while in death row, he want to share with us what his experience was,
    <br>before God Almighty intervened and brought him out and he is here today sharing what God has done.
    <br>So now tell us, what happened after you ministered the Morning Water and used the faith bracelet?
    <br>So when I started ministering the Morning Water every morning when I woke up, I would pray
    <br>saying: "God of of Prophet T.B Joshua, I have been seeing what you are doing  to other people,
    <br>I know that my own will not be a different case.
    <br>You will still do the same just like You are doing for others. I believe that You will set me free."
    <br>I would spray it in my mouth and on my body.
    <br>Then I would wear this thing. When I wanted to pray, I would put it on my tongue, I would do it like this.
    <br>So that's how I have been doing it.
    <br>Death row is not an ordinary place, you are restricted to one place.
    <br>That is where I was for over seven years.
    <br>My medical career has been lost and shuttered.
    <br>So then I was saying: "God, what kind of life is this?" Even sometimes I would get annoyed
    <br>saying what kind of life was this. Sometimes I said I wished I was the guy that died.
    <br>It was better than staying alive seeing my death. Because prison death row is hell on earth.
    <br>That is when I came to know that there is something like hell.
    <br>If that could as tormenting as that - how much more hell?
    <br>One day, I was sleeping. In my sleep I was going somewhere.
    <br>I heard people singing and praising.
    <br>When I looked, I saw the man of God Prophet T.B.Joshua.
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuikem & Family 
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Were you dreaming then or it was physically?
    <br>That was in the dream. I was dreaming then.
    <br>In my dream, I was passing by; when I looked, I saw a very big mighty cathedral.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B.Joshua was wearing white garment, preaching and ministering.
    <br>And there was music at the background, songs and praises at the background.
    <br>I said: "This is the man that I wanted to see, let me go, let me use this opportunity to see the man of God."
    <br>So when I was going, some men blocked me at the gate saying that I couldn't see the man of God,
    <br>that who am I. I said they should allow me, this was the man I have been looking to see since all this while.
    <br>This was an opportunity for me to see him. They should allow me please.
    <br>They said they couldn't allow me, that was not how they did it here.
    <br>I said: "Listen, I am a gospel singer, I can sing very well. I want to go right in there and sing with them."
    <br>They asked, if I was sure that I could sing - I told them I sing very well.
    <br>They agreed. The man just did his hand like this and mic just appeared.
    <br>He said: "Look at this mic, take and sing."
    <br>Then I started singing.They said: "Ok, he can sing!"
    <br>When I started singing then, man of God said: "Who is that person singing over there?"
    <br>They said it was the person that wanted to see him.
    <br>So, the man of God said: "Please, allow him". I passed them and met the man of God.
    <br>I said: "Man of God, see, I want you to deliver me out of prison.
    <br>I am innocent, I did not do anything to deserve this. For over seven years I am in death row
    <br>waiting for execution."
    <br>The man of God asked what I wanted him to do. I said I wanted him to deliver me, I wanted to be free.
    <br>The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua now said: "You are already free, are you not the one coming to church?
    <br>And you are telling me to deliver you, you already a free person."
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuikem & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>That's what man of God said.
    <br>So when he said I was no more in the prison, then I got excited. When I looked around, I woke up.
    <br>So when I woke up, I looked around - I was in the prison.
    <br>I said: "Well, I believe that this is a sign that one day I am going to come out of this place."
    <br>After that incident, two weeks laret I was on death row meditating within myself.
    <br>A warder came and called: "Obioha Chibeikem!" I said: "Sir!"
    <br>He said I should come out. I was wondering where were they taking me to.
    <br>Then they took me to the prison welfare inside the prison yard.
    <br>So when I got there, I saw one man - a huge man who was wearing black suit.
    <br>The man asked if I was Obioha Chibuikem, and I said 'yes'.
    <br>He said that he was here for me, that he was here to set me free out of death row.
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuikem & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So I said: "You are here to set me free out of death row."
    <br>Because I entered death row, I met some elderly men who were 60 years and older.
    <br>So when I asked them: "Daddy, when did you come to this place?"
    <br>They would tell me that they'd been here since1981 or 1985.
    <br>They had been here since before I was born.
    <br>So I was wondering: "Is this how I am going to spend my whole life?"
    <br>Then I said: "They sent you to come and deliver me out of death row?"
    <br>He said: "Yes". I said: "Sent by who?"
    <br>The barrister said: "By nobody." The spirit of God just directed him to come for me.
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuikem & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Now based on what I heard from the fellow death row inmates I was in the same cell with,
    <br>some had gone to the appeals court, where they told them they were going to Supreme Court of Nigeria
    <br>and the Supreme Court of Nigeria failed them.
    <br>They said that before a barrister would take your matter from death row to appeals court
    <br>to appeal your case, you would pay at least 2 or 2.5 million naira.
    <br>So when they said that, I concluded that this was how I was gone.
    <br>I said that no one was going to provide.
    <br>Even if they would sell our houses, they could not afford that kind of money.
    <br>Nobody could bring that kind of money. My mum could not. Look at the woman here.
    <br>It's because of this case that she is like this because
    <br>she tried all her possible ways and they even forgotten me, thinking that I was gone.
    <br>They saw me as dead and burried me and they have even forgotten about me
    <br>since I have been pronounced I was sentenced to death.
    <br>So I said: "You said you are here to set me free, to take my matter to appeals court
    <br>and you said that nobody sent you." Then I said that this thing is very very suspicious.
    <br>Maybe Ebonyi State Government has sent this man to come and say that he wanted to deliver me
    <br>just  to sign my death warrant indirectly.
    <br>I said: "Please, sir, I am not going to sign this thing. I don't know you.
    <br>Before I sign, I should know the source, who sent you."
    <br>The man said: "Why are you saying all this? See I am Senior Advocate.
    <br>Before people contact me, they spend millions of naira and I don't even listen to many cases.
    <br>I don't know why I am interested in your case.
    <br>Well, why I am interested in your case because I knew you are innocent of this matter,
    <br>and that's why I came to pull you out of prison.
    <br>And you are telling me that you are not going to sign. Do you want to remain in prison?"
    <br>My friend, you should sign this and let me pull you out of this prison."
    <br>I said: "Sir, who sent you? Tell me, who sent you, I will sign."
    <br>He said he was sent by the Spirit of God which directed him.
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuikem & Family 
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>On death row there were over 300 death row inmates in Enugu maximum prison.
    <br>Among all of us, it's only me that he said that he wanted to save.
    <br>I said: "Ok, barrister, you can go, let me make some investigations before I can sign."
    <br>The man now left, then I now sent for this evangelist to come to the prison.
    <br>So when she came to the prison, I said: "Look at what is happening.
    <br>One man came and said the Spirit of God directed him to my case.
    <br>He said he is interested in my case, he  wanted to pull me out of this place."
    <br>And the woman asked how much did the man say that he was going to collect.
    <br>I said that I asked him: "How much do you want to collect now?"
    <br>The man said that he was not going to collect a dime from me,
    <br>he didn't need any money from me. He just wanted to do a Godly work and humanitarian work.
    <br>So, the evangelist - the person beside me, sister Edith Amaka - said I should flash back -
    <br>have I forgotten that I sent her to come to Prophet T.B. Joshua because of this very case.
    <br>I said I remembered.
    <br>She now asked, how did I think God was going to save me. Would God come down from Heaven and bring me out?
    <br>It's through human being. That is the physical manifestation of His coming to this place.
    <br>That I should call that man back and endorse and sign that thing -
    <br>it was for good, that she so much believed in it.
    <br>I agreed.Then I asked her to help me call the man because the man was now annoyed with me.
    <br>So she later called. When she called the man, the man said he was no longer coming again,
    <br>that he had come two times and I had refused to sign.
    <br>So the evangelist now plead with the man, asking him not to blame me,
    <br>that based on what happened to me I was afraid that I didn't know who is who.
    <br>So he should please reconsider and go back hence he was doing the work of God.
    <br>And he said it was the Spirit of God that directed him to set me free out of death row
    <br>where I was sentenced to die in prison.
    <br>So, the barrister agreed based on her apology, what he was going to do is
    <br>was to send one of his boys to bring the court proceedings to appeals court
    <br>for me in the prison so that I could endorse and sign.
    <br>So within two days a young barrister came again. bringing the same documents. Then asked me to sign.
    <br>I signed it, everywhere they asked me to sign, I signed.
    <br>The man left. But there is one funny thing about this man.
    <br>This man said that he was not going to collect money and he never told me where he was coming from
    <br>up till now. Since then he left and I have not heard from him again.
    <br>Because if you are  awaiting trial in high court; when you want to go to court, they will take you to the court.
    <br>But once you  have been sentenced to death to die in prison, then you can not go to court.
    <br>Even if your matter is being taken to the appeals court,
    <br>then your matter will be going on in the appeals court while you will be left in the prison.
    <br>You can't appear in the court, because they have seen you as a condemned criminal
    <br>who is dangerous and can do anything to make sure he escapes.
    <br>That is why they don't take condemned  inmates to court.
    <br>Instead, they will be in the prison, while their matter is going on in their absence.
    <br>This happened March in 2016.
    <br>The matter went to the appeals court in March 2016.
    <br>That's when I informed the evangelist that the appeals court
    <br>has finalised everything, that the judgement was coming out on the 31st of January, 2017 in appeals court.
    <br>So we should be praying that God would grant me justice and deliver me from death row.
    <br>I said the information came to me while I was in prison. I claimed and said amen.
    <br>Then on the 31st of January, 2017, I was still on death row praying.
    <br>I said: "God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, You are the God that's been doing all these miracles
    <br>that I have been seeing on television here.
    <br>If You can do all these things to other people outside, then I know that me that is here - I am going to be a partaker.
    <br>As I have come to the Synagogue in the dream, I will also come to this place physically
    <br>to testify the goodness of God of Prophet T.B. Joshua."
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuikem & Family 
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So I prayed throughout that day. Then I was hearing, trying to see the evangelist.
    <br>I was expecting visit from the evangelist to tell me the outcome of the judgement.
    <br>I didn't see her that very day.
    <br>The next day, the evangelist came to the prison - because when you want to come to the prison
    <br>and see somebody, you apply for visit.
    <br>They go and bring that person to see the person. When she came to Enugu maximum prison
    <br>and applied to see me, they came to my cell, opened the cell, brought me out and took me to the visit room.
    <br>So there she told me: "Congratulations, young man, you have been discharged and acquitted
    <br>by the appeals court Of Nigeria."
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuikem & Family
    <br> Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So when she told me that I have been discharged from the appeals court Of Nigeria,
    <br>then I just fell down, not knowing what to do.
    <br>I asked her: "What are you telling me? Are you sure that I am now a free person again?
    <br>Is it in this life or in the dream?"
    <br>She said that she was telling me truth. She was not here to play tricks on me.
    <br>I said that I hoped that this was not a joke, please. If this was a joke, I wouldn't survive it .
    <br>She said that I have been discharged and acquitted by the appeals court.
    <br>When she said that, I said there was no problem.
    <br>After that I remained there because once you have been discharged by the appeals court,
    <br>the prison authorities can't allow you to go until an order from the appeals court
    <br>ordering the prison to allow you to go, that you have been discharged and acquitted.
    <br>So that was what was keeping me in the prison.
    <br>After two weeks, they brought the court order.
    <br>So when the deputy controller of Enugu maximum prison checked it,
    <br>there was an error in the court dates.
    <br>Then the man said that based on this error,  the court would recall it
    <br>for them to correct the error. The appeals court
    <br>doesn't sit everyday. They sit once or twice in a month.
    <br>From the 31st of January, 2017, I had to stay again till
    <br>March 5th for them to correct the court order.
    <br>They corrected the error - that typographical error that was in the discharge order - and returned it back.
    <br>So when they returned it back, they came just to my cell
    <br>and said: "Obiha Achibike!" I said: "Sir!" He said: "Pack your load and go."
    <br>Then I was said: "Wait". They said: "Come and go. So now you are causing a problem.
    <br>They have discharged and acquitted you. Come and go."
    <br>I said: "Ok, sir." I packed my things, then I came out.
    <br>When I came out, then in fact, I wasn't with myself because
    <br>when I came out, I couldn't walk very well.
    <br>When I was walking, it would look as I want to fall because I didn't walk.
    <br>I don't know where to start.
    <br>Since I came out, I was looking for this barrister that did this work.
    <br>I have not set my eyes on this barrister since then.
    <br>I don't know his home; I don't know his whereabouts up till now.
    <br>So I am also using this medium of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the SCOAN to say:
    <br>"Barrister Oneye Onyechi, you are really a Messiah in my life.
    <br>God used you through the man of God Prophet T.B.Joshua to send you to Enugu maximum prison
    <br>while I was waiting for execution, to die by hanging; you came and delivered me.
    <br>Since you don't want me to see you to show appreciation, wherever you are, I am using this avenue to thank you.
    <br>May God bless you. May the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua barrister Onyechi Oneye - bless him abundantly."
    <br>Mr Obiha Achibike & Family
    <br> Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Prison death row was very very horrible.
    <br>When I came out, I wasn't  like this. It was outside that I now recovered.
    <br>I would have come here since all this while but I didn't have transport money  to come here
    <br>and I was waiting to recover a bit because I was very very haggard and tattered.
    <br>We know, he that feels it knows it.
    <br>So how do you feel now, that you are set free from this death row you have been for seven years?
    <br>In fact, it's really really wonderful miraculous deed in my life.
    <br>Since I was born, I haven't experienced this kind of miracle.
    <br>You know, sometimes, even if I had this problem, I didn't really believe that maybe thing is real.
    <br>But today I am a testimony myself. I am a testimony. I am a partaker, I experienced it.
    <br>In fact, it was really really tremendous in my life.
    <br>We also join you to say "Thank you, Jesus" for what He has done.
    <br>And then, when you were explaining yourself and testifying of the goodness of God,
    <br>you said there was a particular document that had to be rectified before you could be
    <br>completely let out of that death row. Are you with that document?
    <br>Yes, I am with the documents.
    <br>Ok, can you show us the document?
    <br>Children of God, as you can see, this is the discharge order ordering the prison
    <br>authority, Nigerian prison authority to set me free from death row
    <br>because I am innocent of the offence that I am being alleged of.
    <br>So as you can see, it's being stated in the court of the appeals court, Enugu Judiciary Division Holden At Enugu
    <br>Suit No HAB/15C/2013. Appeal No CA/E/27C/2016
    <br>Appeal against the judgement of the Ebonyi State High Court of Justice

    <br>Between Obiora Chibuike, the appellant and the state, respondent on the Tuesday the 31st Day of January 2017.
    <br>Upon reading the record of the appeals court herein and briefs of argument filed

    <br>for the respondent, H.M.Ogunwumiju Presiding Justice, Court of Appeal
    <br>It is hereby ordered as follows; number 1 -  the appeal is allowed.

    <br>the Appellant and sentencing him to death by hanging is hereby set aside.
    <br>Instead, an Order of discharge and acquittal is hereby made.
    <br>As God pleases.
    <br>Mr Obiora Chibuike & Family 
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So for the benefit of those listening to us; what you have read is the rectified  discharge certificate?
    <br>Discharge certificate.
    <br>So all the charges against you has been set aside.
    <br>It's been nullified and set aside. I am innocent.
    <br>Glory be to God. Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>He is telling us, he is a completely free human being not to be on the death row any longer.
    <br>We are still going to come back to you, to hear more from you concerning this wonderful
    <br>miracle the Lord has done in your life. But let us listen to the lady evangelist.
    <br>We want to hear from her what she has to say concerning what the Lord has used her to do.
    <br>Mr Obiora Chibuike & Family
    <br> Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>By the grace of God, I am Evangelist Edith Uzoamaka Udeh.
    <br>Actually, I am overwhelmed, I am so grateful to God, I am so happy.
    <br>Tell us what was your encounter like with the brother beside you.
    <br>And what was the conversation between you and him?
    <br>So, actually, I started the ministry, I usually go to prisons. I pay more attention
    <br>to the condemned criminals, those that are sentenced to die because I just have that passion that
    <br>these people are going to die some day - let me pray for them, let them repent at least
    <br>before they will die. So that day I met him; he was trying to explain his problem to me.
    <br>But the thing that struck me seriously was that he was sentenced to death
    <br>and they were not able to move the case to appeal.
    <br>At least, when you are sentenced to death, you have appeals court. You have Supreme Court
    <br>to appeal your case and see, if God will have mercy on you there.
    <br>But due to lack and want in the family, they were not able to take this case to appeal.
    <br>So when he narrated, I felt bad. He now begged me to go to Lagos
    <br>on his behalf. So I told him I usually come to the Synagogue, that I would come.
    <br>So I went. He gave me his address, I went to the family. I went to the mother.
    <br>I got his picture, I came.
    <br>Actually, other times, when I came to the Synagogue, I didn't have the opportunity to meet the man of God.
    <br>But on that particular incident that I came on his behalf I was privileged to meet the man of God,
    <br>and he gave me the bracelet.
    <br>Evangelist Edith Uzoamaka Udeh & Mr Obiora Chibuike 
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>And the Morning Water. So as soon as I got back, I had to visit him
    <br>and give him the bracelet and the Morning Water and I encouraged him to believe
    <br>that God would not come from Heaven but it' was through the prayer of the man of God
    <br>and all these here - God would work and deliver him.
    <br>So when the lawyer now started coming, he went to a warder to inform me what happened.
    <br>So I had to tell him that, for me, as long as you have come to the Synagogue -
    <br>I didn't believe that God could disappoint us and we would now have a problem.
    <br>I only believed that we were coming out of the problem. So he should not be afraid of that
    <br>man that came and said he should sign. It was only God that could do that.
    <br>So by God's grace, I called the man, and pleaded with the man. He came back and he signed.
    <br>And at the end of the day,  in 9 months precisely he was discharged and acquitted.
    <br>It's a great thing. I shout, it's so wonderful.
    <br>Evangelist Edith Uzoamaka Udeh & Mr Obiora Chibuike 
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So we want to just hear this from you: What actually inspired you, when he told you
    <br>or informed you that he wanted you to go to the Synagogue on his behalf and you came?
    <br>And all what you were given - you didn't take it to yourself, you actually took it back to him.
    <br>What was behind that action?
    <br>Just like I was trying to explain initially. So when I saw his own problem,
    <br>I saw his own problem bigger than my own.
    <br>So somebody to be on death row, expecting to die any day... Me - I'm still alive,
    <br>I'm still able to go around, preach in the prison yard.
    <br>So I didn't see my problem big any more, I just saw his own as more bigger.
    <br>So when I got that bracelet and the Morning Water, I quickly gave it to him to use it for himself.
    <br>Well, we thank Almighty. Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>And we know, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is a problem Solver.
    <br>And all believers are. Remember, you can allow God to use you as God has used this woman
    <br>to solve this brother's problem and remove him discharged and acquitted him from the prison row.
    <br>So we still want to hear from other members of his family.
    <br>Let us hear from our elderly father, who is on the seat there.
    <br>I am very very happy to be here.
    <br>I am grateful to be here today to testify the goodness of God.
    <br>My names are Felix Ingichukwu Obioha.
    <br>And the brother - who is he to you, sir?
    <br>He is a son to my late brother. I am an uncle to him.
    <br>It happened that in our family nobody was a graduate.
    <br>And he came out with a good brain. He has a very nice brain.
    <br>So when he gained admission from Ebonyi  University, then I was told
    <br>that Chibuike gained admission at some place.
    <br>I looked at myself, I said we have about 3 - 4 other ones going to various secondary schools.
    <br>But as it is like this, let's see what we can do. Then we rallied around him.
    <br>I am the head of the family for now. Just like a father to all of them there
    <br>in the Obioha family. So I realised that I was not able to raise the money immediately.
    <br>I used a parcel of my land to lease money from one of our community member.
    <br>Then after one year, we kept managing to make the payments for his school fees and the other things.
    <br>Then after one year, I was just at one garage, I received a call.
    <br>They said: "Brother, Chibuike has a problem." I said: "What happened?"
    <br>Then the guy narrated the story to me. I was shocked. Then I moved back to my yard.
    <br>When I got home, I told my wife. I said: "See what I have heard about Chibuike."
    <br>My wife was surprised. She said that based on that I was supposed to go home and hear from family members
    <br>in the village. I travelled home and I confirmed the story was true.
    <br>Then I said: "Which type of problem is this? Where do we start to face murder case?
    <br>And see all efforts we have made to make sure this boy gain at least a good education."
    <br>It has been like this. Then I tried to contact people who know a good lawyer
    <br>that could take care of the case. Then they could be able to direct us to a barrister that could take care of the case.
    <br>I sold again a parcel of my land to make sure I free the life of this boy.
    <br>But all effort was abortive; we could not achieve anything by spending all those money.
    <br>At every sitting they would tell us to bring this or that.
    <br>We were transporting from the village and the barrister himself was collecting his own quota.
    <br>Then at the end of the day, I heard that finally they have passed death...
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuike & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>We know it is indeed an emotional  time for our father, hearing that news that the
    <br>son, is having a murder case against him and he has sold all he has as the head of a family
    <br>to send him to school and also to get him out of this murder case, all to no avail.
    <br>Obviously, anyone would become depressed and distressed in such circumstances.
    <br>And even now that the brother is set free,
    <br>baba can still think back. Our father can still think back and see all
    <br>what he has passed through as an elderly man and he burst into tears.
    <br>So sir, just tell us more, how did it feel like then, and how do you feel now - that
    <br>your son is saying he has been discharged completely from this murder case
    <br>and is no longer on the death row?
    <br>I thank God that he is now free. That is the most important thing.
    <br>But on the other hand, we lost so many of our assets because of this boy's case.
    <br>And for now he is out, he is not doing anything.
    <br>I particularly even sold the vehicle I was using.
    <br>But my happiness to be here today is to give thanks to Almighty God
    <br>and give thanks to the God of T.B. Joshua who made it possible
    <br>and Evangelist Amaka who was the mediator.
    <br>Left for me, I didn't know anything. I didn't know what was even going on
    <br>after the judgement there of condemning my son. I didn't hear any other news.
    <br>Because that day was just a black out in the family. I can say that for the past week or two
    <br>we just cried and mourned him
    <br>not knowing  that God would still bring him back to us.
    <br>So I thank God. I thank my God.
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuike & Family
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>So before you go, sir - what word of advise do you have for people listening to you?
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us- Matthew 1:23). My advise to people that are listening to me
    <br>is to believe in God. Believe that with God all things are possible.
    <br>Because of the case of this my son  and because of the faith of man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua -
    <br>it is his faith that is doing all these miracles.
    <br>My advise to people is to have faith in God and know that with God all things are possible.
    <br>I would like people to listen to the SCOAN and listen to his preaching -
    <br>his preaching goes for humanity, not for finances.
    <br>So I just paid attention, that's why I made an effort to be here and
    <br>to see by myself, to step my feet into this Synagogue.
    <br>As I stepped my feet into this place, I believe that as his problems were solved,
    <br>all problems should be solved. Emmanuel!
    <br>Mr Obioha Chibuike & Family 
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>We give glory to God. We know, Jesus Christ is the solution to all fundamental issues of life
    <br>and with Him alone all things are possible. And our father is advising all and sundry
    <br>that we should trust in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and put our hope,
    <br>our faith in Him. And let us quickly listen to our brother.
    <br>What word of advise do you have for people listening to you?
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us  - Matthew 1:23). If God is with us...
    <br>My general advise to viewers in Nigeria and in the world at large is that
    <br>both young and old ones should be very careful about the kind of people they associate with,
    <br>the kind of places they go to
    <br>and to be very very prayerful because sometimes, even if you don't look for problems,
    <br>problems may come.
    <br>But when you know God and start praying, God will remove those problems on His own
    <br>because we don't have strength. The youth should abstain from crime.
    <br>They should abstain from crime because the only thing crime will do for you
    <br>is to hurt you, put you in prison. Prison is not good; prison is a place of torment.
    <br>And I must use the opportunity to tell you that prison is hell. Hell fire on earth.
    <br>When you die in the spirit, they have other hell fire, but presently hell fire is prison.
    <br>That is how I understood it because for the seven years I've been in prison, it's all about torture and torment.
    <br>Ok, we thank God Almighty and we also want to let you know that the power
    <br>that set you free and delivered you and brought you out can also restore all that has to do with you.
    <br>So it's never too late.
    <br>Our adversity can be so undesirable and so painful but remember, people of God,
    <br>that our adversity is there to strengthen our faith and our desire to follow God.
    <br>So we want to encourage you to continue to serve God in spirit and in truth,
    <br>and make His word the standard for your life.
    <br>And we pray God Almighty will grant you the inner grace to do so in Jesus' name.
    <br>And once again, shall we put our hands together for the miracle working Jesus.
