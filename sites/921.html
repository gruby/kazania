  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I was trying to be jealous of you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I was telling God, "Please, Baba God, release me!
    <br>I want to dance! I want to join them!"
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to thank you for your time.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>If you do things at God's time, you will astonish yourself,
    <br>you will surprise yourself.
    <br>Just wait for God's time.
    <br>I remember that I left you on a message 'Talk on Faith'.
    <br>Talk on Faith.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>There is no substitute for faith.
    <br>There is no what?
    <br>There is no exchange for faith.
    <br>There is no substitute for faith.
    <br>Faith's value is unique - so unique.
    <br>Let's quickly talk about that.
    <br>Halleluyah.
    <br>Open the book of James 2.
    <br>Look at verse 18.
    <br>"But someone will say, 'You have faith; I have deeds'."
    <br>That is work.
    <br>"Show me your faith without deeds..."
    <br>It means, faith and your work, and the work of faith.
    <br>"...and I will show you my faith by my deeds."
    <br>By my actions.
    <br>"You believe that there is one God."
    <br>That is the statement there.
    <br>"You believe that there is one God. Good!"
    <br>There is a talk there.
    <br>"You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?"
    <br>That is evidence.
    <br>"Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did
    <br>when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?"
    <br>Verse 22.
    <br>"You see that his faith and his actions were working together,
    <br>and his faith was made complete by what he did."
    <br>That is father Abraham.
    <br>Talk on faith.
    <br>Halleluyah.
    <br>We are faced with God's uncompromising demands for faith.
    <br>You can see that there is an issue here.
    <br>We are faced with God's uncompromising demands for faith.
    <br>The righteous shall live by faith.
    <br>Whatever is not from faith is sin.
    <br>Without faith, it is impossible to please God.
    <br>This is why I call it, uncompromising demands for faith.
    <br>He who comes to God must believe and have faith.
    <br>There is no substitute.
    <br>They are Divine demands.
    <br>Its values are unique.
    <br>There is no substitute for faith - no alternative, no shortcuts.
    <br>This is why we are Christians.
    <br>The Bible says faith must be confessed with the mouth
    <br>but this faith confession must proceed from genuine faith in our hearts.
    <br>It must proceed from where?
    <br>From genuine faith in our hearts.
    <br>Why?
    <br>That shows that there all kinds of faith - faith in stones, faith in this, faith in that,
    <br>faith in faith, faith in yourself.
    <br>In the world, they use the word faith in business.
    <br>"I have faith in that business." - This is misusing the word.
    <br>Faith is a trust.
    <br>You can only trust God and love everyone.
    <br>You cannot trust human beings; they will leave you one day.
    <br>Faith is a trust but we use it as a misused word - all kinds of faith.
    <br>We are guilty of using empty words.
    <br>Today, we are guilty of using empty words. That is, an empty profession of faith.
    <br>You see people say, "Yes! In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>An empty profession of faith will not help us in any way.
    <br>It's like talking to the air.
    <br>"In Jesus name!" is going nowhere; it's in the air; it is an empty profession of faith.
    <br>Faith confession must be backed up by appropriate action.
    <br>That is faith without what?
    <br>I mean, faith without an appropriate action is dead.
    <br>Faith confession must be backed up by appropriate action.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>Let me just give you a picture of what I'm talking about.
    <br>If I say, I believe God will heal me and I'm at the same time worried and distressed,
    <br>my faith is questionable.
    <br>I say, I believe God will heal me. God will deliver me. God will bless me.
    <br>Like many of us are sitting down now.
    <br>After you finished dancing, you are now falling into your self-pity again.
    <br>But when you were dancing, you were happy.
    <br>After that now, you start thinking, "Ah, the thing is paining me again.
    <br>The thing is hitting me again".
    <br>Is it dancing that removed it?
    <br>No!
    <br>You believe God will heal you; you believe God will bless you and save you
    <br>and you are at the same time worried and distressed -
    <br>that nullifies your faith - question mark.
    <br>If you have faith in God, you should not just believe in Him.
    <br>If you have faith in God, you should not just believe in Him.
    <br>That is the idea today: Everybody believes in God, that is why you are here today.
    <br>Look at the picture.
    <br>Faith is like children to their father.
    <br>Not only should we know God as our Sovereign Lord,
    <br>we should know Him like children know their father.
    <br>You know your father.
    <br>Good children; good father.
    <br>You say, "Daddy!"
    <br>You know the time to ask daddy what you want.
    <br>You know the time not to ask daddy, and you know the time to greet daddy.
    <br>Today, you don't know the time to ask God what you want; that is why you ask wrongly.
    <br>You don't know the time to come to God.
    <br>You don't know what God has in store for you.
    <br>The Bible says we must know God's will and pray according to His will.
    <br>But you don't know God's will; you only pray.
    <br>You don't know whether what you are asking is God's desire to give you.
    <br>You don't know.
    <br>You pray but you never know God's will concerning what you are asking for.
    <br>Whether it is the time to give you what you are asking for.
    <br>Whether that is exactly what He has in mind to give to you.
    <br>And whether it is the right time to give it to you. But you don't know, you just pray.
    <br>"In Jesus' name! In Jesus' name! Amen!"
    <br>That is why you always have disappointment - you pray, no answer.
    <br>You don't know when to pray, how to pray and what to ask for. You don't know.
    <br>Faith is like good children, loving children to their loving father.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>The picture of belief is like a farmer saying, "I believe God is able to give me a harvest
    <br>without planting any seed".
    <br>"I believe God will give me, God is able to give me a harvest" - that is a farmer.
    <br>I am giving you a picture of belief without faith.
    <br>Many of us as believers today, we do not know how to believe, and express our faith. That is the problem.
    <br>We do not know how to believe and express our faith.
    <br>You don't know; that is believers today.
    <br>We believers, we do not know how to believe and express our faith.
    <br>Faith is expressed through work.
    <br>By work, faith is perfected.
    <br>If I say, "I believe it will not rain" and at the same time, I carry an umbrella along,
    <br>that is a question mark.
    <br>That has nullified your faith.
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>It means you have not yet had faith.
    <br>Because when our hearts are uneasy and worried, this shows that we have not yet had faith.
    <br>That's when you are going and you say, "I believe it will not rain".
    <br>Now carrying an umbrella shows that you are worried.
    <br>There's a kind of worry in your heart.
    <br>That is why you have to carry an umbrella along.
    <br>I believe it will not rain. But now I'm going to carry an umbrella along.
    <br>That shows there is a kind of worry.
    <br>How should one have faith?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>We have faith through the daily things around us.
    <br>I will not say through the happenings around us - I limited it.
    <br>I want to limit it this way - through the daily things around us.
    <br>My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes, they all belong to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have just forgotten that.
    <br>Can you, on your seats, sing along with me?
    <br>My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things.
    <br>When you want to sit - "In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>It means you believe in God to sit.
    <br>You want to stand - "In Jesus' name!"
    <br>You believe in Jesus to stand, you believe you cannot stand without Jesus.
    <br>You must know how much you need God to have faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You must know how much you need God to have faith.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>You must know how much you need God to have faith.
    <br>Today, we don't know how much we need God.
    <br>You don't know, you believe you can sit on your own.
    <br>There are many things you believe you can do on your own.
    <br>How many of you have called the name of Jesus before combing your hair?
    <br>Before you begin to dress up, how many of you say, "In Jesus' name!"?
    <br>When you are about to see, will you call the name Jesus to see?
    <br>You want to eat, will you call the name of Jesus to eat?
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives.
    <br>For you to have faith in God, that faith we are talking about,
    <br>you must know how much you need God.
    <br>That's why I take you to shoulder, head, toes.
    <br>Total dependence upon Him - you are not totally dependent on God
    <br>because there are many things you do on your own.
    <br>Those are things satan uses to hit you.
    <br>Each time satan wants to attack you, he goes through those things you do on your own.
    <br>You know you can sit on your own, you don't need to invite Jesus,
    <br>you don't need to bring Jesus to the scene before you sit.
    <br>Many people today that are just about to sit have strokes.
    <br>They collapse.
    <br>You need to know how much you need Jesus to have faith in Him -
    <br>in things both great and small.
    <br>Not mine not mine
    <br>The choice
    <br>In things both great and small
    <br>Be Thou my Guide my strength 
    <br>My wisdom my all
    <br>That's all.
    <br>This is where your problem comes from: You don't know how much you need God.
    <br>That's all.
    <br>You don't know how much you need God.
    <br>That is why you have a time for prayer.
    <br>All time is for prayer, not a time for prayer.
    <br>If you knew how much you needed God - total dependence on Him to smile, to drink,
    <br>to look, to turn your neck - you would pray 24/7.
    <br>To greet, you need God to do that.
    <br>That is why you cannot have faith.
    <br>Faith is not a part-time Christianity; it is full-time.
    <br>If we cannot commit our bodies to God when we are sick and troubled,
    <br>who will believe you have faith?
    <br>Who will believe? - Only the foolish.
    <br>If you cannot trust in God in your sicknesses, afflictions, situations and tribulations,
    <br>when will you trust him?
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you cannot trust in God in your trouble, tribulation, situation, temptation,
    <br>when will you trust in Him?
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: TALK ON FAITH | PART 4
    <br>There are many troubles people carry to me.
    <br>You would see them after the prayer, they would carry their medication to see me,
    <br>"Man of God, this is my drug".
    <br>Some would meet me and say, "Will I still be using my medicine after the prayer?"
    <br>If you cannot trust in God with your medicine, you cannot trust in God without your medicine
    <br>because God Himself is the God of nature.
    <br>Those medicines are derived from nature - plants.
    <br>If a farmer can trust nature without a definite promise,
    <br>we Christians should trust the God of nature.
    <br>God is God of nature.
    <br>For an operation to be sucessful, God makes it successful.
    <br>For one to have a good treatment, God makes it thus.
    <br>He opens the way for a successful operation; He opens the way for a successful treatment.
    <br>We treat; God heals.
    <br>Doctors treat; God heals.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: TALK ON FAITH | PART 4
    <br>He opens the way for a successful operation,
    <br>for a successful treatment.
    <br>He opens doctors' eyes to give you appropriate treatment - the rightful treatment.
    <br>He opens their eyes.
    <br>If not, they'd not see anything, they'd not even know how to go about it.
    <br>Tablets and medicine are nature and God is God of nature.
    <br>If you cannot trust in God with your medicine, you cannot trust in Him without your medicine.
    <br>God bless you.
