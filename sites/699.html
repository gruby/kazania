    <br>This is the early ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The acts of giving started right at the beginning of his ministry.
    <br>As you can see, by the view of the church, this is indeed the early ministry.
    <br>Let's listen to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>As many as we are in the congregation,
    <br>can we see someone who can say they are the poorest here?
    <br>T.B. Joshua asked the congregation, "Can we see someone who can say they are the poorest here?"
    <br>The Early Ministry Of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Look at the many people coming out in response to the Man of God's question.
    <br>Lets listen to one of them.
    <br>I have been suffering since I was young.
    <br>I have no job, nothing.
    <br>My children are scattered everywhere.
    <br>I cried every year.
    <br>I even cried this morning before coming to The Synagogue Church.
    <br>The woman says that she has been suffering since she was very young.
    <br>She has no job, nothing, her children have scattered about and she cries all the time.
    <br>Take. This is the key to a bus.
    <br>The man of God, T.B. Joshua gives the woman the key to a bus.
    <br>The man of God would have wanted to give her money worth the cost of the bus
    <br>but the woman insisted that she wanted to go with a bus.
    <br>She said, she will use it for commercial purposes, as a transportation bus
    <br>and this would help her to earn money, by which she and her family could live -
    <br>money for accommodation, her children's school fees and her life's welfare.
    <br>Along with the key, this woman was also given a licence and the registration papers for the vehicle,
    <br>proof that she is now the proud owner of this bus.
    <br>Those who once saw her as a poor woman will now see her as a blessed child.
    <br>This is the first bus that was given to the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua in his early ministry.
    <br>It was his first time ever to own or have a bus.
    <br>But instead of using this bus for his personal benefit, he said it was not yet time for him to use a bus.
    <br>He gave the bus to the needy.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>My name is Florence Olawaye.
    <br>The suffering was too much; even to eat and drink was difficult.
    <br>I have been suffering since 15 years.
    <br>I am a member of Christ Apostolic Church.
    <br>What happened to you today?
    <br>I was given a key to this bus.
    <br>Florence recounts her former life of suffering.
    <br>She is saying, for the past 15 years, life has been a struggle,
    <br>even finding means to eat and drink is difficult.
    <br>But God heard her cry, and through T.B. Joshua, she was given a key to her very own bus.
    <br>Watch as she walks towards the door of her new bus and opens it with the key.
    <br>The key she received as a gift from the man of God not only unlocked the door of the vehicle
    <br>but opened the way for her to start life anew.
    <br>Psalm 30:5 says, sorrow may last for a night but joy cometh in the morning.
    <br>As she sits in her new bus, she sings praises to God
    <br>because He has taken over her sorrow and replaced it with joy.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
