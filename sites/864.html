  <p>    
    <br>Imagine being totally unable to see anything at all - what a torture it must be.
    <br>As this man is led forward at The SCOAN by a lady, it is obvious that he has a problem with his sight.
    <br>He gropes for a chair and tentatively lowers himself into it.
    <br>Let us hear from Mr Reuben Nwosu who has come to the church with a problem of blindness.
    <br>My name is Nwosu Osita Reuben.
    <br>I came from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>Can you tell us exactly the problem that brought you to The SCOAN today?
    <br>It is a problem of blindness.
    <br>On the 5th of April, I loaded my bus at Maza Maza conveying passengers to Aba, Port Harcourt.
    <br>When I climbed the bridge, it seemed as if the road was dividing because I saw double double.
    <br>I could not see again and immediately I put the brake on the highway.
    <br>When this happened, I called my wife and my elder brother, Chief Linus Nwosu who is living in London with his wife.
    <br>He said I should leave that hospital immediately, enter a night bus to Lagos and go to see Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I believe and have faith that I will be cured here.
    <br>We pray with you that Lord Jesus Christ will set you free today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Mrs Nwosu.
    <br>- Where do you come from?
    <br>- Imo State.
    <br>- The man sitting next to you - who is he to you?
    <br>- He is my husband.
    <br>Tell us what is the problem that brought your husband to The SCOAN today.
    <br>My husband is blind now.
    <br>He was driving before the incident happened on the highway.
    <br>He called me on the phone to tell me that he cannot drive anymore; that he cannot see.
    <br>When he called me, I was very shocked and didn't know what to say.
    <br>At a stage when we had been to two hospitals, he called his brother and explained everything
    <br>and he told him to come to see T.B. Joshua and he believed he would be healed.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Mr Reuben Osita Nwosu is let to the prayer line by his wife during The SCOAN's Monday service.
    <br>Holding a placard for all to see that he has the problem of blindness and he is booked for an operation
    <br>all his faith and hope is in Jesus Christ - the compassionate Healer of our wounds.
    <br>Help me, Man of God! My husband is blind; he cannot see.
    <br>Help me, Man of God! My brother in London sent me to come and receive my healing here.
    <br>I cannot see.
    <br>I am booked for an operation.
    <br>I am blind now.
    <br>I cannot see.
    <br>Help me Man of God, my husband cannot see.
    <br>They booked him for an operation and we don't want to go for an operation.
    <br>Please, help me; he is blind!
    <br>My husband is blind!
    <br>Man of God, please help me!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In Jesus' Name
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can see!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I can see!
    <br>Man of God, I can see!
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Continue with your work!
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>I can see now.
    <br>I can see clearly.
    <br>I thank Jesus!
    <br>My name is Mr Reuben Osita Nwosu.
    <br>What is the problem that brought you here?
    <br>Blindness. I was moving on the highway when all of a sudden, I couldn't see.
    <br>The man of God approached me and touched my eyes; I can see now!
    <br>My eyes are clear; I can equally drive my car now.
    <br>I am seeing people lining up.
    <br>This is milk colour.
    <br>This one is red; he's a small boy.
    <br>This one is black, white and blue.
    <br>This is the man of God in front of me.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This is the man of God in front of me.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Healed Of Blindness In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>So we can see our brother walking forward by himself to the glory of God.
    <br>This is the man that we saw in the clip just moments earlier
    <br>who came to The SCOAN with the case of complete blindness.
    <br>And here he is today to share a wonderful testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>Sir, you are welcome, in Jesus' name. Please, tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>Good Morning church.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Osita Reuben Nwosu.
    <br>I am from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am working with a transportation company and drive a bus.
    <br>I was loaded on the 5th of April to Port Harcourt.
    <br>When I moved, I was very sound and didn't have any problem.
    <br>All of a sudden, by the time I was climbing that fly-over at Mile 2, heading to the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway,
    <br>it happened that one road began to appear to me as two roads.
    <br>By the time I noticed what was happening, I tried to apply my brake on the expressway.
    <br>The passengers were asking me, "What is happening, Mr Nwosu?",
    <br>because some of them know me.
    <br>I said that I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>By then, I had managed to leave the main road.
    <br>Before I knew it, it was like darkness began covering my eyes.
    <br>I couldn't see.
    <br>I quickly gave one of my passengers my phone to call my coordinator in the company.
    <br>We parked by the side.
    <br>In a short time, we had assistance from the company and another driver came.
    <br>Everybody was surprised to see such a thing.
    <br>People started asking questions.
    <br>I was totally blind immediately.
    <br>I was shouting, "What have I done to receive this kind of thing?"
    <br>I started reciting and asking myself, "Why must I go blind?"
    <br>I asked somebody to call my wife.
    <br>It was somebody who called my wife through my phone there to tell her what was going on.
    <br>Some suggested that we should move instead of stopping there.
    <br>They said we should head down to Onitsha where I went to an eye clinic.
    <br>My colleagues in Onitsha took me there.
    <br>We met a white male doctor.
    <br>He examined my eyes and told me my eyeballs were receding into my head.
    <br>I asked him what that meant and he told me I had gone blind and that the solution was to operate.
    <br>He said he would give me some medicine so I could go home and prepare myself.
    <br>I said it was not my portion; I could not go blind.
    <br>They called my brother in London, my immediate elder brother, Chief Linus Nwosu.
    <br>He lives in London.
    <br>I told him what was going on and he asked how it had happened; I said I didn't know.
    <br>He said I should not waste time, that they should put me in a vehicle and bring me back to Lagos.
    <br>He said I should proceed to The SCOAN immediately.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Osita Reuben Nwosu
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>I came through the night bus; somebody had to take me because I couldn't understand anything.
    <br>I was like somebody who was intoxicated.
    <br>My brain hurt and I had a headache.
    <br>My wife came to the bus stop and picked me up and we immediately proceeded to The SCOAN.
    <br>By the time I got here, it seemed as if I was looking at the high sea.
    <br>When I opened my eyes, it was as if I was looking at the beach.
    <br>I didn't perceive anything anymore; nothing crossed in front of my eyes.
    <br>My wife told me I should not cry.
    <br>People gathered and helped put me on the line to see the man of God.
    <br>They were putting me in the front to see the man of God.
    <br>I couldn't see anybody; I was shouting, "Man of God, help me! I have gone blind totally!"
    <br>For more than five days - blindness.
    <br>I perceived when the man of God touched my stomach.
    <br>I was still shouting because I couldn't see anybody.
    <br>He came back again and touched my eyes; it was like he wiped from my forehead to my eyes.
    <br>All of a sudden, I saw people.
    <br>I began to see people; I began seeing again!
    <br>It wasn't a surprise because I had seen others healed.
    <br>I had belief and faith that I would be healed here and I have my healing.
    <br>I can see now.
    <br>Even the day I came here, I didn't know the colour of the clothes I was wearing.
    <br>That was why they washed it for me so I could appear in it again and tell the world what I saw.
    <br>I am very, very delighted that I can see again!
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now, at this point, we want to ask our brother a question.
    <br>He said just moments ago that when Prophet T.B. Joshua approached,
    <br>he was not seeing him but he felt a hand touching his stomach and rubbing his face on four occasions.
    <br>Sir, we want you to describe to us. What can you say about that hand that just touched you?
    <br>Because definitely before people has also addressed your eyes and I am sure your wife also touched your eyes,
    <br>other people, the doctors that examined them.
    <br>But what can you say about that hand that just rubbed your eyes four times and you began to see?
    <br>How can you describe it for us?
    <br>The hand that touched my face was so cool and quiet on my head.
    <br>All of a sudden, the headaches I had been suffering from, disappeared.
    <br>It's like when somebody wakes up from a slumber.
    <br>They open their eyes and start to see; that is exactly what happened to me.
    <br>The hand touch is the miracle that happened.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Since then, I have been seeing clearly; nobody assists me anymore.
    <br>I was wondering what kind of sickness it was - automatic blindness.
    <br>I was on a highway, conveying lives.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Wow. We thank Jesus. We can see our brother how he walked unaided, he is moving by himself.
    <br>To the glory of God, sir, we see you actually holding a pamphlet in your hand.
    <br>Can you just demonstrate your total healing by reading what is there?
    <br>Yes, I can read.
    <br>"Obedience Is The Key".
    <br>This is the caption of this booklet.
    <br>English side: "As a Christian, the only way to feel good about yourself
    <br>is to begin to believe and accept what Jesus has done for you."
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Nwosu.
    <br>I am a wife of the man that gave his testimony.
    <br>I am here to support him.
    <br>It was very terrible for me; he could not do anything for himself during that process.
    <br>I was the one assisting him.
    <br>When we would come down from the vehicle, I was the one who would hold him.
    <br>But today, I am a happy woman because God has done it.
    <br>That which I could not buy with money, God has done it.
    <br>I say, may God who has done this for me, answer everyone of us, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You have your Bibles; viewers around the world and those present here.
    <br>You can turn to Mark 8:22-26, and the Scripture reads thus:
    <br>"They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.
    <br>He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village.
    <br>When He had spat on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, 'Do you see anything?'.
    <br>He looked up and said, 'I see people; they look like trees walking around.'
    <br>One more time Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes.
    <br>Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly".
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Take notice of all of these details.
    <br>You will see that when the Prophet prayed for him,
    <br>he stood up and it was as if at that moment he couldn't see everything so clearly.
    <br>As we read in the Bible, he was just seeing objects and then suddenly his eyes were completely opened
    <br>and he was able to see everything.
    <br>We just saw him read the sermon, so this is an incredible transformation in the life of our brother.
    <br>What we have seen today is a demonstration of what we read about in the Scriptures,
    <br>because the Book of Acts, the gospels of Jesus Christ, they are not mere history books.
    <br>They are the pattern of what Jesus Christ wants His church to be today.
    <br>And the power of God we read about in the Bible is available and present in our midst today.
    <br>And by the grace of God, that same hand that touched our brother and restored his sight,
    <br>God is going to use that hand to touch your life today.
    <br>My advice: This kind of affliction is not something you can even wish on your enemies.
    <br>If anything like this happens, instead of running helter skelter,
    <br>if you believe, I believe the cure or healing will come.
    <br>It is belief that made me receive instant healing.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Praise the Lord".
    <br>Man of God sent a message: That same mighty hand that put the problem of the blindness to the past
    <br>is working in the lives of many now.
    <br>Many sicknesses and diseases have been removed now, in His presence.
    <br>Check yourself!
    <br>That hand is touching your life, your spirit, your soul and is bringing down all sicknesses in your body.
    <br>Check yourself and get ready for your testimony.
    <br>As the service is going on, to God be the glory.
    <br>Watch your screen. Everybody, check yourselves.
    <br>There are still many miracles happening around in the auditorium because the anointing of God is present.
    <br>Put a demand on that anointing. Check yourself, because indeed God Almighty has met you at the point of your need.
    <br>That is what we are seeing on the screen. See the woman waving her hand and rejoicing to the glory of God
    <br>for what God has done in her life right now
    <br>as she has put a demand on the anointing of God, here, in the arena of liberty.
    <br>Watch your screen to the glory of God.
    <br>Children of God, praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Mrs Ngozi Okorafor.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a fibroid for more than eight years.
    <br>I was sitting down over here.
    <br>When the man was giving testimony, the man healed of blindness,
    <br>I saw the clip where the man of God prayed for the man and I held my stomach.
    <br>I started praying and asking God when I would give my own testimony.
    <br>Immediately I stood up from my chair to walk downstairs,
    <br>I just heard a sound from my stomach.
    <br>An elderly woman called me back and told me there was blood on my leg.
    <br>Before I knew it, blood and the fibroid came out. Everything is stained with blood.
    <br>Now, my stomach is free. Everything feels free.
    <br>I can touch my stomach anywhere I want to touch it.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Before, I could not press my stomach.
    <br>The evangelist said that the same hand that touched the man would touch us today.
    <br>Then, I used my faith to put a demand on that word.
    <br>Now, the hand has touched me.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ?
    <br>The hand that delivered the man from blindness has delivered me, now!
    <br>Now, I am good; my stomach is very soft.
    <br>Before, I could not press my stomach. Now, it is soft; I am free.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Mrs Ngozi Okorafor
    <br>Fibroid Came Out During Testimony Time
    <br>The doctor told me that because of that fibroid, I could not give birth.
    <br>For over eight years, I have not given birth.
    <br>The doctor asked me to come for an operation. I said OK.
    <br>He said the operation was fifty-fifty as to whether or not I would be able to give birth.
    <br>But because of the fibroid, he said I could not give birth.
    <br>I said, OK, that I would go but since then, I have not gone to the doctor.
    <br>I said that I believed that at The SCOAN, I would be healed.
    <br>Today, I am OK; I am free indeed without an operation!
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>After her remarkable encounter with Jesus Christ, during the time of testimonies,
    <br>Mrs Ngozi makes her way to the restroom within the church premises.
    <br>Her leg and clothing are clearly stained with blood from the fibroid that had just burst,
    <br>as she connected by faith to the anointing in the arena of liberty.
    <br>With a look on her face you can see that parts of the fibroid are still busy coming out.
    <br>And here you can see thick pieces of the fibroid that just came out of Mrs Ngozi, as the power of God hit her.
    <br>Indeed, a million thanks are not enough for Jesus Christ.
