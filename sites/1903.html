    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>This is a section of pregnant women, who are here for safe delivery.
    <br>Many of them have been booked for operation because of complications
    <br>and they are here looking in faith to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>The resurrection power of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is working in the midst of the people.
    <br>You can see what is happening to this pregnant woman.
    <br>See what she passed out right there, as the man of God stretched forth his hand towards her,
    <br>praying for her, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>A few hours after the powerful prayer that Geneva Amam received in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>news reached Prophet T.B. Joshua that she was at the point of delivery,
    <br>and on the instruction of God, he went there to declare her free.
    <br>Receive deliverance!
    <br>Be free!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Out, Ezekiel!
    <br>BABY BORN as PASTOR PRAYS (2020 UPDATE!!!)
    <br>What you have just watched is the miraculous birth of baby Ezekiel.
    <br>Mrs Geneva Amam had come to The SCOAN with complications in her pregnancy.
    <br>The doctors had diagnosed a tight cervix,
    <br>for which they had booked her for an operation.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for Geneva in the prayer line
    <br>and immediately her waters broke and she went into labour.
    <br>A few hours later, Prophet T.B. Joshua went to her at the labour room
    <br>and spoke the word of prophecy, identifying both the name and the gender of the child,
    <br>saying, "Ezekiel - come out!"
    <br>Instantly, baby Ezekiel was delivered.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Geneva Amam.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a tight cervix
    <br>and I was booked for an operation.
    <br>I also had high blood pressure.
    <br>I was rejected at two or three hospitals.
    <br>They said the baby was big, that they would not be able to handle the delivery.
    <br>Because of the high blood pressure, they said they would not be able to operate on me.
    <br>As the cervix was tight, there was no way the baby could come out
    <br>and the blood pressure was too high for them to operate on me.
    <br>So my husband took me to The SCOAN where I was placed at the prayer line section.
    <br>The man of God prayed for me.
    <br>Immediately he placed his foot on my foot, the water that was holding the baby
    <br>and causing the cervix to be tight burst and poured out instantly.
    <br>Then my body became cool and calm.
    <br>After some time, the labour started and the baby could not come out.
    <br>The man of God also came to pray for me and said, "Ezekiel - come out!"
    <br>Instantly, where the power came from, I couldn't imagine - the baby just came out!
    <br>All I heard was the cry of a baby.
    <br>And it was a baby boy. I was shocked. I was surprised.
    <br>I said, "How?"
    <br>How did the man of God know that I was carrying a baby boy?
    <br>I give God glory because the baby is alive and I am alive, strong and healthy!
    <br>What man cannot do, God did it
    <br>through the able hands of His anointed servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And here you can see me carrying Ezekiel.
    <br>I thank God for that.
    <br>I give God all the glory.
    <br>I am Mr Patrick Amam.
    <br>The woman next to me is my wife, Mrs Geneva Amam.
    <br>The baby is Ezekiel Amam.
    <br>I ran down to the hospital as early as 4 am in the morning.
    <br>I noticed that my wife had become weak and had developed high blood pressure.
    <br>I knew that we needed God's intervention.
    <br>The hospital objected.
    <br>I told them to keep our bags,
    <br>that if God intervened, I would bring her back to them.
    <br>They allowed us to go.
    <br>We came here directly and the man of God prayed for my wife.
    <br>The first time the man of God prayed for her, the cervix opened, her waters broke
    <br>and my wife felt cool throughout her body.
    <br>I had peace; I was happy.
    <br>The man of God came the second time.
    <br>He mentioned the sex of the baby while the baby was still in the womb.
    <br>He said, "Ezekiel" three times and said, "Ezekiel - come out!"
    <br>and the boy came out immediately and cried.
    <br>There was jubilation everywhere in the church.
    <br>We give God glory.
    <br>I thank God for this mercy and favour for my family.
    <br>10 years later, Ezekiel came back with his mother to visit The SCOAN,
    <br>the place where God had called him out of his mother's womb.
    <br>Good Morning, viewers all over the world.
    <br>I want to share with you my testimony of 10 years ago concerning my son, Ezekiel Amam.
    <br>When the doctors examined me, they were unable to help me.
    <br>So I went to another hospital.
    <br>When I was examined at that hospital,
    <br>they said my cervix was tight and that as I had high blood pressure,
    <br>they could not refer me to another hospital,
    <br>because no doctor would want to operate on somebody with hypertension and a tight cervix.
    <br>My blood pressure was too high for a pregnant woman.
    <br>I was rejected at two hospitals before I as accepted at that hospital.
    <br>My husband took me to another hospital where we faced the same rejection.
    <br>At that time, I was between life and death.
    <br>Immediately I entered the vehicle - that was all I could remember.
    <br>How we got to The SCOAN, I didn't know.
    <br>How I was placed on the prayer line, I didn't know.
    <br>It was when the man of God stretched forth his hand and prayed for me that my waters broke.
    <br>That was when I came back to life.
    <br>Mrs Geneva Amam had come to The SCOAN with complications in her pregnancy.
    <br>The doctors had diagnosed a tight cervix,
    <br>for which they had booked her for an operation.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for Geneva in the prayer line
    <br>and immediately her waters broke and she went into labour.
    <br>And then contractions started immediately.
    <br>I was taken to where I would deliver the baby.
    <br>As a human being, I had no strength left in me.
    <br>I could not do anything on my own anymore.
    <br>The man of God heard about it and came.
    <br>As he was praying, he called the name of the baby, "Ezekiel - out!"
    <br>Instantly, where the strength came from - I couldn't imagine; the baby came out!
    <br>A few hours later, Prophet T.B. Joshua went to her at the labour room
    <br>and spoke the word of prophecy, identifying both the name and the gender of the child.
    <br>Receive deliverance!
    <br>Be free!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Out - Ezekiel!
    <br>BABY BORN as PASTOR PRAYS (2020 UPDATE!!!)
    <br>And behold, it was a baby boy!
    <br>When he said, "Ezekiel - come out!"
    <br>when I saw the video of the delivery and how he called the name of the baby,
    <br>and behold it was a baby boy, I started asking myself,
    <br>"How did the man of God know I was carrying a baby boy in my womb?"
    <br>Because I had never seen him face to face before;
    <br>we had never discussed anything concerning the pregnancy.
    <br>Even how I was placed on the prayer line, I didn't know.
    <br>I would say I was unconscious because I couldn't even move when I was at the prayer line.
    <br>It was when my waters broke that I realised I was in The SCOAN.
    <br>So how come the man of God knew I was carrying a baby boy?
    <br>People of God, you can imagine that.
    <br>Now he is 10 years old.
    <br>Since he was born, we have never gone to hospital for any sickness.
    <br>The grace of God through the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua has been upon him,
    <br>leading him in all that he does.
    <br>In school, he always comes first in his class.
    <br>The teachers all love him because of his behaviour in school.
    <br>When you see him, you will see that truly he is a prophetic child.
    <br>He reads his Bible; he always talks about God.
    <br>Anything he does, you will see him calling Jesus.
    <br>At times, he would call his mates and tell them how he was born
    <br>because I always tell him: "Look at how you were born.
    <br>Remember to follow the way of the Lord.
    <br>Don't go away from God because without Him, you wouldn't have been alive."
    <br>So, I want to praise God and thank Him for that.
    <br>I want to thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua -
    <br>for making himself available for God to use in our generation.
    <br>Remember, in one of his quotes, he said: "If millions of this generation are to believe,
    <br>they must see proof that Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever."
    <br>You see my my boy here - he is one of the proofs
    <br>that Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Now I want to advise expectant mothers all over the world -
    <br>those that are watching me right now.
    <br>Please, believe God; trust in Him.
    <br>If He can do this for me, I tell you there is nothing He cannot do for you.
    <br>My name is Ezekiel Amam.
    <br>I am ten years old.
    <br>I am in grade six.
    <br>I always come first in my class.
    <br>My favourite subjects are English and social studies.
    <br>My hobbies are electronics and studying the Word of God.
    <br>My mother has said it all - of how God delivered me
    <br>and saved me through the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I thank God for him.
    <br>Since I was born, I have never been taken to hospital.
    <br>I have always been healthy and obedient.
    <br>My mother has always been reading the Bible for me -
    <br>taking me to the Word of God, telling me that I should never run away from Him.
    <br>Whenever I remember how my mother told me how I was born,
    <br>I always feel happy and excited that God loves me so much.
    <br>My advice to young people like me who have watched my testimony is that
    <br>they should always obey their parents and they should not run away from God.
    <br>Thank you.
