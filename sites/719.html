    <br>As Jesus was leaving the city of Jericho
    <br>There was blind Bartimaeus begging beside the road
    <br>When he heard it was Jesus coming close
    <br>Ignoring the opposing crowd
    <br>He cried out with a loud voice saying
    <br>Son of David have mercy on me
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me
    <br>Your Divine favour locate me
    <br>Son of David have mercy on me

    <br>Can you hear that? The blind Bartimaeus had been begging for money,
    <br>but money could not solve his problem.
    <br>He had been begging for alms but that couldn't solve his problem.
    <br>When he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was coming close - do you know that desperation has a sound?
    <br>Desperation has a sound.
    <br>He cried out! He cried!
    <br>He said, "Son of David! Son of David!! Son of David, have mercy on me!
    <br>Have mercy!"
    <br>He cried, "Let your mercy speak for me".
    <br>He said, "Your Divine favour, Lord, come onto me.
    <br>Help me!"

    <br>Your Divine favour locate me
    <br>Son of David have mercy on me
    <br>I want you to make a desperation sound, cry out, "Son of David!"
    <br>Desperation has a sound.
    <br>Make that sound for your children at home, husband, wife, career - desperation has a sound.
    <br>He did not allow the opposing crowd to hold him down.
