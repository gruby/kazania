  <p>    
    <br>In memory of the Martyrs of Faith, in this documentary, we bring to you exclusive footage
    <br>from The SCOAN archives, where witnesses and survivors give their accounts of what happened
    <br>on September 12, 2014.
    <br>I want to salute the Martyrs, our people who are so faithful to God -

    <br>I want to salute them.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to say thank you.
    <br>I salute your faith.
    <br>The message I have for you, I will read it page by page
    <br>so that you can be able to write it down.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let me first of all say thanks to the following organisations and their support.
    <br>First, the state we are today – Lagos State and the Federal Government of Nigeria.
    <br>Thank you very much for your support and your prayer.
    <br>And the security agencies of different bodies -
    <br>I will not be able to mention you one by one; we have many security agencies around.
    <br>I want to salute you and also thank you very much for your love and your prayer,
    <br>and your support.
    <br>Let me also remember engineers and humanitarian groups with their equipment.
    <br>For some days now, I want to say thank you once again for your support.
    <br>Rescuers from different bodies – you just see people from everywhere.
    <br>Let me remember the doctors – what a wonderful people from all over,
    <br>not even Nigeria alone, but from everywhere and their hospitals too.
    <br>Media – I want to say thank you to the media
    <br>because I know the relationship of Jesus Christ with the media in the Bible.
    <br>Yes, Emmanuel TV is the media of The Synagogue.
    <br>If we fight the media, we are fighting Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So, we want to salute you. Thank you very much.

    <br>and I salute your faith.
    <br>Let me remember diplomatic missions all over the world.
    <br>We received letters from nearly all the embassies,
    <br>praying and supporting us in prayer
    <br>and asking what they can do.
    <br>I want to say thank you diplomatic missions all the world
    <br>- thank you very much.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to thank you.
    <br>There are many organizations I will not be able to mention.
    <br>If there is any organization I have not mentioned here,
    <br>I want to say thank you for your prayer and for your love.
    <br>I want to start my message here.
    <br>I will just give you a detail because the security agencies need to do their job.
    <br>In a nutshell, let me start from the very day
    <br>- that was Friday morning.
    <br>I was in the mountain.
    <br>I left there at exactly 8 am in the morning
    <br>and I received a phone call immediately.
    <br>Where I left, I received a phone call immediately when I got here.
    <br>It was just a ten minute interval.
    <br>When I was in the church, there was a jet hovering,
    <br>moving around at a very close range at the mountain which I had just left.
    <br>The place I left at the mountain, I received a phone call that there is a jet moving around that spot.
    <br>Well, I told them that I was in the church.
    <br>Before I knew it, I received a phone call again that there was a jet here,
    <br>the same jet here,
    <br>at the church, hovering around a building,
    <br>passing over the building four times at a very low range,
    <br>before the building collapsed.
    <br>So, we are going to show you the video
    <br>because the CCTV covered it.
    <br>September 12, 2014. A building at The SCOAN collapses after a strange aircraft flies low,
    <br>multiple times over it before disappearing.
    <br>SCOAN visitors captured the strange aircraft on their cameras at the entrance of the building.
    <br>A SCOAN visitor's photo – a strange aircraft flies low over a building at The SCOAN.
    <br>This is an enlarged view of the photograph taken.
    <br>It reveals the close proximity at which the strange aircraft flew over the building shortly before its collapse.
    <br>Let us listen to the visitors who took the photo, saw the aircraft and survived – September 12, 2014.
    <br>My name is Shadrack Mamzini. I am from South Africa.
    <br>We arrived here on September 11, 2014.
    <br>After the service in the main church, we went out for lunch.
    <br>When I was entering the other part of the church,
    <br>I wanted to take some pictures of The SCOAN buildings.
    <br>I took two pictures.
    <br>While I was taking the last picture, I discovered a very big aircraft.
    <br>It was something which was unusual in the way it looked.
    <br>It did not look like a passenger flight or an ordinary
    <br>flight.
    <br>I asked myself what it was.
    <br>I thought maybe it was because the airport was close
    <br>and the aircraft was going to land.
    <br>My worry was that it was too low to the building.
    <br>In South Africa, that kind of plane - such big aircraft - don’t fly close to buildings.
    <br>I thought to myself that because the airport is close,
    <br>the aircraft was trying to go and land.
    <br>There was a certain lady, who came into the canteen shouting and screaming,
    <br>crying that the building had collapsed.
    <br>It was when we went outside to see that, we saw it had collapsed.
    <br>I zoomed the picture where I saw the aircraft clearly on the  picture.
    <br>This is a photograph taken by Mr Shadrack on his cell phone.
    <br>A look at the upper left-hand corner reveals the strange aircraft as it flew over the building.
    <br>By the time the incident happened, there were a lot of talks on it.
    <br>It wasn't until the man of God revealed what really happened,
    <br>that I went back to check my photos, all the photos I had taken.
    <br>My name is Thobile Bhaku. I'm coming from South Africa.
    <br>When I entered the building, I heard the aircraft
    <br>but I did not care about the aircraft.
    <br>I went inside the dining hall because it was lunch time.
    <br>On the queue, I was served.
    <br>While I was preparing coffee for myself, I heard a big sound behind me.
    <br>It was something like a big bang.
    <br>When I looked up, I saw the slab falling down.
    <br>Because of my experiences – I am a health and safety officer -
    <br>I have been trained on what to do.
    <br>When a beam is falling on top of you, you have to go to the opposite direction.
    <br>I ran to the opposite direction.
    <br>As I was running to the opposite direction,
    <br>I saw the walls were cracking all over.
    <br>Suddenly, I was on the floor
    <br>and it was dark, as if it was not during the day.
    <br>It was very, very hot and dark on the inside.
    <br>But in some cases, we could feel that there was fresh air coming in.
    <br>We did not know where the fresh air was coming from.
    <br>We prayed to God and thanked God.
    <br>We thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for praying for us.
    <br>My name is Mick Milambo. I am from South Africa,
    <br>originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
    <br>I was walking with my friend, Joseph.
    <br>He is not here; he went back to South Africa today.
    <br>At that time, we walked and had just crossed the gate here.
    <br>We saw the aircraft.
    <br>It was just passing here, slowly – a big aircraft.
    <br>My friend told me, "If you see an aircraft like this, it is trouble".
    <br>The sound was not that big; it was small and it was a big aircraft.
    <br>But it was passing, not far but slowly.
    <br>After that, we went into the same building the aircraft had passed over.
    <br>That was the same building we were going to.
    <br>Our lunch was supposed to be taken there.
    <br>After that, they started serving lunch.
    <br>We managed to get our lunch.
    <br>I can say about after ten minutes, I heard just a sound.
    <br>You know, it was like glass, when you break glass.
    <br>We were just here; the wall was behind us.
    <br>We just turned to look at what had happened and we saw this thing was coming to us, fast.
    <br>It was very fast.
    <br>That was the sound.
    <br>Everyone was down.
    <br>We started calling each other.
    <br>We started praying.
    <br>God is great; we didn’t cease to shout the name of Jesus down there.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Charles Thawane from Johannesburg, South Africa.
    <br>On Friday, we were in the church.
    <br>At lunch time, we went out and were moving to where they were serving.
    <br>Where we were going was next to the building that later fell.
    <br>I saw the aircraft was going to the building
    <br>but I was with my friend and he was just taking photos of The SCOAN buildings.
    <br>That aircraft, when it came, I did not think it would come to the building
    <br>because it was coming as if it was going to pass the building
    <br>but suddenly when we saw it on the photo, it was turning to the building.
    <br>It was big.
    <br>It was big but it was not making a loud sound.
    <br>The sound was not too much because if it was too much, I think everybody was going to look up.
    <br>It was a silent one when it was moving.
    <br>It was moving very slowly.
    <br>It looked like a jet.
    <br>It didn’t look like an ordinary plane that you take when you go somewhere.
    <br>After that, we passed the building.
    <br>We were going to where we were going to eat.
    <br>Then, my friend was still taking those photos.
    <br>That was what I had seen and then, that was it.
    <br>What I would like to confirm is what people saw on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>the clip the man of God showed.
    <br>Some say it looks like a bird; it is not an aircraft.
    <br>But I would like to confirm it, that it was an aircraft.
    <br>We saw it; we witnessed it.
    <br>We thank God because on one of the pictures taken, the aircraft was captured.
    <br>I would like to believe it was the plan of God that pushed that excitement to take those pictures.
    <br>It was the Holy Spirit. Thank you very much.
    <br>Security footage September 12, 2014.
    <br>A strange aircraft flies low over a building at The SCOAN multiple times before the incident
    <br>and after the incident, the strange aircraft does not return.
    <br>September 12, 2014
    <br>Take note of the upper left-hand corner of the screen.
    <br>A strange aircraft flies over the building of The SCOAN before the incident at 11:30 am.
    <br>Thirteen minutes later, the strange aircraft flies low over the building before the incident - 11:43 am.
    <br>Just two minutes later, the strange aircraft returns
    <br>and flies lower over the buildings before the incident - 11:45 am.
    <br>Nine minutes later, the strange aircraft returns and again flies low over the building
    <br>before the incident - 11:54 am.
    <br>This is the moment of the incident.
    <br>You are about to watch the CCTV footage of the September 12 incident at The SCOAN,
    <br>from cameras at different angles, of how it took place.
    <br>This is what the building looked like before the September 12 incident occurred.
    <br>Now watch the CCTV footage from a different angle,
    <br>showing a closer view of the building from the second camera.
    <br>Footage from another CCTV camera,
    <br>positioned facing the end of the building,
    <br>reveals the incident from another closer angle.
    <br>Take note of the building in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
    <br>From this angle, you can see clearly the precise moment of the incident.
    <br>THE MOMENT OF THE INCIDENT
    <br>Take note of the top of the screen.
    <br>As the CCTV footage played in slow motion,
    <br>reveals exactly what happened to the building,
    <br>frame by frame during the incident.
    <br>Look again to what happens to the building during the exact moments of the incident
    <br>as the CCTV camera continues to reveal in slow motion each moment of the incident.
    <br>THE MOMENT OF THE INCIDENT
    <br>This is the moment of the incident.
    <br>THE MOMENT OF THE INCIDENT
    <br>Can you see? The whole thing became powder and rubble.
    <br>No single appliance was brought out when the building went down.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>Let me continue my message.
    <br>After the fourth time, we could not see the aircraft again.
    <br>Let me read a little message for you before I bring out some details.
    <br>In this environment of Ikotun-Egbe, we have never witnessed an accident of a building collapse.
    <br>This is to tell you that we have a stable terrain in Ikotun-Egbe.
    <br>I have been in this community for the past 30 years
    <br>and there has been no record of a building collapse.
    <br>As a minister of the Gospel, our first priority is life saving.
    <br>There is no compromise in what we do at all.
    <br>I am going to leave this for you to judge.
    <br>Take note of that – I am pregnant of the word.
    <br>We have left the security to do their job.
    <br>Let us believe - take note of that - and educate our people and be alert.
    <br>Why we should believe -
    <br>so that our country will not witness a similar incident in another place.
    <br>This is not the first time.
    <br>If we believe, we will educate our people and be alert.
    <br>No matter how long a lie is sustained, the truth will some day prevail.
    <br>We should remember the militant who came with his group to this church
    <br>with a bomb, and he was arrested.
    <br>It was televised. Upon televising it and showing it on the screen,
    <br>all groups were saying it was a lie -
    <br>but later they discovered that it was true
    <br>because they felt their presence somewhere.
    <br>The case of the militant is still with the security.
    <br>The press men, the news all over the world said the story was false.
    <br>Let us listen to what this man has to say.
    <br>My name is Mustapha Umar.
    <br>I am from Adamawa State, Yola.
    <br>I am a Boko Haram member.
    <br>Boko Haram is a cult.
    <br>I know why I joined the cult.
    <br>We have killed many souls from Adamawa to Maiduguri (Borno) States.
    <br>What brought you here?
    <br>This is my first time to come to Lagos.
    <br>And you came to where?
    <br>We came to The SCOAN. We stopped at the junction there.
    <br>- Junction opposite the church?
    <br>- It was opposite the church.
    <br>When you stopped there - what for?
    <br>We stopped there.
    <br>We used a 'maruwa' (three-wheeler) to come to The SCOAN and dropped at the junction.
    <br>Opposite the junction, a Hausa man sells some things.
    <br>What is he selling?
    <br>He sells sweets, soap, cigarettes and provisions.
    <br>When you met the man - what else?
    <br>So, when we met the man, we were five in number.
    <br>I was holding the bag which had the instruments we came with.
    <br>I met the man and asked him to keep the bag.
    <br>You met the man, and you asked him to keep the bag.
    <br>The bag contained what?
    <br>It contained some instruments, sir.
    <br>What are the 'instruments'?
    <br>All those instruments were to destroy and kill - it is a bomb.
    <br>I gave him the bag and said, "Keep this bag for me."
    <br>He said, "No", that he doesn't keep anything for anybody there.
    <br>I spoke Hausa language to him because I saw him as my only brother here.
    <br>He refused to collect the bag.
    <br>We decided to carry the bag with us.
    <br>I said, "Let us sit down here and eat."
    <br>After we had eaten, we would prepare for our mission here.
    <br>We sat down and ate as they brought food for us.
    <br>The woman had a television in her shop and we were watching it.
    <br>You were watching what?
    <br>It was Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw you particularly,
    <br>you were preaching to people at that time.
    <br>As you were preaching, we were sitting down, eating.
    <br>By the time you prayed and stretched your hand toward the screen,
    <br>it was like you were dealing with us - as if you laid your hand on our faces.
    <br>Once you stretched your hand, it was like you laid it on our  faces directly.
    <br>That is when all our plans ceased - 
    <br>confusion came between us.
    <br>Assuming you people were not there when the prayer was going on,
    <br>what was the plan?
    <br>Our plan was to take souls at The SCOAN.
    <br>That bomb inside the bag - how would you people do harm?
    <br>It is just like a meter; there are wires you join together.
    <br>The button we press can be set to explode in one hour or one minute.
    <br>We can set it to explode in three minutes.
    <br>If we set it to five minutes and drop it,
    <br>before five minutes are over, we would leave that place.
    <br>- You people would leave the place?
    <br>- We would leave the place.
    <br>What would happen?
    <br>All the souls around there - everybody will go.
    <br>What is your problem?
    <br>Why are you here?
    <br>Why I am here? Since that day, I wanted to go back home but couldn't.
    <br>Anytime I lie down, I would see you.
    <br>It is disturbing me too much.
    <br>What is disturbing you?
    <br>You are disturbing me.
    <br>I don't know what I did to you.
    <br>Where are your colleagues - the other people?
    <br>Everybody scattered.
    <br>Why are you alone?
    <br>Why me alone? I don't know why I stand alone.
    <br>It is bothering me too much.
    <br>This is my first time to come to Lagos.
    <br>So the other people are still in Lagos?
    <br>I don't know where they are now.
    <br>I called them on phone but none of them picked my call.
    <br>What of the bag with the bomb?
    <br>Our master took it back.
    <br>OK, how do you come about these things?
    <br>What gives you the courage to do this?
    <br>How do you manage to have the heart to do what you are doing?
    <br>They wrote something in a language.
    <br>Then, they washed it and gave it to me to drink.
    <br>You drank it?
    <br>I drank it. That was the day I was initiated.
    <br>After drinking it, I had the mind to kill souls.
    <br>OK, why did you want to see me?
    <br>Why can't you run away, now?
    <br>Everybody ran away, but you.
    <br>Why are you coming here to say this kind of thing?
    <br>Why? What is worrying you? Tell us.
    <br>Why am I coming to this place?
    <br>I want to go, but I don't have the spirit to go.
    <br>You don't have the spirit to do it again?
    <br>I don't have the spirit to do it again.
    <br>That is why I don't want to sleep in the night - I would always see you laying that hand.
    <br>You don't sleep in the night?
    <br>I don't want to sleep. If I sleep, you would be disturbing me, telling me I should not go there,
    <br>you would be praying for me and laying hands on me.
    <br>Since he could not sleep, and rest, and has no peace,
    <br>he says he wants to die, if I don't release him.
    <br>I don't know why he should say that.
    <br>While other people have run away,
    <br>and I know anywhere they are, they are under bondage, serious torture, which this man could not bear.
    <br>And he said he would not run away; he wants to get free.
    <br>I want to tell you that for the past two weeks now I have been wearing these jeans.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>This is two weeks now.
    <br>I wore them last week,
    <br>I wore them yesterday
    <br>- the same jeans I am wearing now.
    <br>You should know that something is going on.
    <br>I have been in a serious battle for the past two weeks.
    <br>Those who looked at me yesterday know that this is what I wore.
    <br>Last week - this is what I wore too - the same.
    <br>I would have worn the same shirt as yesterday, but people would easily see that it was the same one.
    <br>It is not possible for me to stand in your midst and begin to tell you what I had seen in the spirit about to happen.
    <br>But, I had seen it for the past three weeks.
    <br>I had also set a trap on the corners of the church.
    <br>Anywhere the trap was, it was to catch.
    <br>We didn't even want them to enter here,
    <br>because their entering here would create fear.
    <br>Just a discussion concerning the issue - the trap for the past three weeks.
    <br>I will not stand here to tell you...
    <br>I can be telling you the prophecies about any another nation, but concerning me...
    <br>What would you do for me now?
    <br>You have been praying for me already.
    <br>If I stand up now and say, "This is what is going to happen",
    <br>I don't know the way you would look at it.
    <br>So, I kept it to myself.
    <br>Jesus gives the strength.
    <br>Here is the brother.
    <br>I want him to be released because his heart went to the cult.
    <br>He cannot help himself. 
    <br>He does not know the direction to follow.
    <br>He cannot close his eyes.
    <br>He cannot sit down.
    <br>He cannot do anything.
    <br>My mission is to separate him from this spirit that is controlling him to do that.
    <br>We are not to fight mere flesh and blood.
    <br>We are to be armed for battle.
    <br>The thought of evil against the anointed man of God is a crime
    <br>and it is an abomination to God, if you are a true man of God.
    <br>That thought just sitting down somewhere, anywhere you are;
    <br>you are thinking, "What can we do? How do we get him? How do we destroy him?
    <br>How do we fool him? How do we disgrace him?"
    <br>It is God you are talking about - "Touch not My Anointed and do him no harm".
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>- Who am I?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Can you face me?
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>On the floor!
    <br>Vomit it out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vomit it out!
    <br>Whatever they might have given you that inspired you to kill people - vomit it out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Vomit it out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>On the floor!
    <br>He is looking at the person who is talking.
    <br>On the floor!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Imagine they carry that bomb into this place.
    <br>Ok. Stand up!
    <br>Run!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Have you attempted any operation before and failed?
    <br>I have never failed before.
    <br>There was the operation we did at the Airforce Base at Maiduguri.
    <br>- Airforce Base at Maiduguri? 
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- You were one of them?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>We went to Adamawa State, Michika, two weeks ago.
    <br>And you never attempted anything and failed before?
    <br>We never failed.
    <br>How is it that you failed in this operation?
    <br>The reason this one failed when we came to The SCOAN was because we went to eat,
    <br>but before, when we went for any job like this one, we would never think of going to eat
    <br>because we would have already satisfied ourselves before coming out.
    <br>We don't know what pushed us to decide to go into the shop to eat.
    <br>While we were sitting down eating, we were five people,
    <br>we looked at the television when you laid your hand on the screen;
    <br>you laid your hand on our faces and that was when the confusion started
    <br>and everybody found their way.

    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The spirit that was leading him to kill is gone.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you feeling now?
    <br>Man of God, thank you!
    <br>He is crying.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>He is crying.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>He says, "Thank you". He feels different.
    <br>He is now the very person he used to know.
    <br>If you give him something, he cannot slap people now,
    <br>talk less of killing people.
    <br>So he has been delivered.
    <br>He has a lot to say because a lot has gone on.
    <br>He is going to defecate everything that he has eaten
    <br>because everything is neutralized now.
    <br>There were beads (charm) you used to wear.
    <br>Yes, I used to wear it but it was very tight.
    <br>How do you know that I was wearing something - beads?
    <br>He says what?
    <br>He said, "How did the man of God know that he used to wear something on his waist?".
    <br>Ok, thank you.
    <br>I am very sorry.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you want me to ask a lot of questions.
    <br>He has said it all - this is the first operation he has failed at.
    <br>Whatever you want to hear, that is not my nature.
    <br>My nature: I love people, I can't fight mere blood and flesh but the spirit being that caused this.
    <br>My duty is to deliver him.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>If you are thinking of repercussion - 
    <br>what would have happened if 200 people would just die, and the name of the ministry -
    <br>if you are thinking about that, you should also think about Christ on the Cross for you.
    <br>I know you will ask me, “Why Synagogue?”
    <br>That is the question that is going through you, “Why this church?”
    <br>Yes. Don’t forget the spiritual blessing that God has bestowed on us.
    <br>A big head wears a large hat.
    <br>Don’t quickly forget about the Ebola issue too.
    <br>It was God who rescued this ministry from the issue.
    <br>They wanted to put the issue of Ebola.
    <br>If possible, they would have taken an Ebola patient and dropped them into the church.
    <br>You remember the text message you received: "Ebola is in the church - don't go there".
    <br>Cook hot water and put salt. Say: "T.B. Joshua".
    <br>You have forgotten? Don't forget.
    <br>God rescued this ministry from that.
    <br>They were trying to scare you from coming to this church.
    <br>I know my hour has not yet come.
    <br>I have not yet finished my job.
    <br>I have not finished my job.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>Don’t forget the message you have been receiving for the past two weeks.
    <br>I was talking to you in parables.
    <br>Go over the messages –
    <br>you will see the picture that when a situation like this comes,
    <br>you should know how to handle it.
    <br>It has come and God is on top of the matter.
    <br>Let me remind you of what I said during the last Sunday service:
    <br>that what would be happening between now would be much much greater than 10 years.
    <br>How many of you were in the service?
    <br>I want to assure you that our God will get back to them.
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>God will get back to them – the agents of satan, and you will know when He gets back to them.
    <br>You will know, because of what happened. Look at what happened. You will know.
    <br>And I am happy that the whole thing starts here.
    <br>I will tell you the reason why I say, "The whole thing starts here".
    <br>From the beginning, it has been a battle.
    <br>If you notice, I have been talking to you for the past two weeks now in parables.
    <br>I want to show you some documents here.
    <br>These documents - I think my wife is just seeing them now for the first time.
    <br>Only those who received it from the email department, and I.
    <br>Those who received those documents, I warned them: between me and you and God;
    <br>Nobody should see these documents.
    <br>But because of what has happened, I think I will just show you one.
    <br>Just one.
    <br>I want somebody to come out and read this document.
    <br>With the picture.
    <br>"Man of God, my name is Emmanuel Anaja.
    <br>I am from Kogi state, living in Jos,
    <br>right now with my parents, who is a soldier.
    <br>I have a confession to make.
    <br>I want to give my life to Jesus Christ, our Saviour.
    <br>I am a Boko Haram member.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN to plant a bomb in The Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>but I could not do it because of God, who called you.
    <br>I went back to Jos with the bomb, which I still have with me.
    <br>Now, I want to show the whole world the God you serve.
    <br>Man of God, Senior Prophet TB Joshua, please talk to God for me
    <br>for the Bible says, "Confess your sins to one another."
    <br>This is the picture of the man.
    <br>For security reasons, I think I will not give you more than that.
    <br>This is one out of thousands.
    <br>The reason why I am showing you this is for you to know the God you are serving.
    <br>God wants to reveal to you what He has been doing that you don’t know.
    <br>Probably, we may not appreciate what He has been doing.
    <br>And I know that because of what I have shown you, those who are faithless may not come here again.
    <br>If I had shown it in the past, the faithless generation might have not wanted to come.
    <br>It is not one.
    <br>It is not two.
    <br>It is not three.
    <br>I have picked and I have reported them to the security.
    <br>Do you know what it means for the church, you trust in so much, to show something on the screen?
    <br>You must have confirmed that it is true.
    <br>Because it is not normal to show something which is not true on the screen.
    <br>I was showing it for a good two months, still you were saying that it was not true.
    <br>Not until you saw their presence somewhere.
    <br>What happened – we should believe it so that we can educate our people to be alert.
    <br>If not...
    <br>I said it last time concerning Boko Haram,
    <br>what you are seeing now is not going to stop here,
    <br>but our God will get back.
    <br>Maybe this will be the end of the whole thing.
    <br>I want to salute the Martyrs, our people who are so faithful to God
    <br>- God’s Generals -
    <br>people who know the God they are serving -
    <br>I want to salute them.
    <br>Thank you, all over the world.
    <br>I want to say,
    <br>the story we read for the past three days -
    <br>you know, I remained silent - I had to,
    <br>because I know...
    <br>My life has been like that.
    <br>Right from the beginning of my life,
    <br>people were lying,
    <br>but they would still come back to the truth.
    <br>My life has been like that.
    <br>And that is a good life - for people to lie against you first, before they realise the truth.
    <br>If people had realised the truth at the beginning, the story might have not started,
    <br>because there is "sorry" all over.
    <br>Here I am – I leave you for you to judge.
    <br>I am a prophet.
    <br>Security has a job to do.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Let's watch the difference between what happens when a building collapses because of controlled demolition
    <br>and when a building collapses because of structural failure.
    <br>We will leave you to judge for yourself...

    <br>CONTROLLED DEMOLITIONS
    <br>On July 27th 2014, six weeks before the incident at The SCOAN on September 12th 2014,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a word of prophecy about a "cloud covering Nigeria... as close as my mouth."
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>I came back from Colombia.
    <br>I wanted to travel from there to another country, but I came back home
    <br>because there is a cloud that covers Nigeria.
    <br>I want to witness how this cloud will dispel.
    <br>Cloud means trouble.
    <br>Look at what is happening here.
    <br>You will not see it on national TV, but if you learn that they bombed here now,
    <br>one of you will call CNN that they have bombed The SCOAN.
    <br>A rescue agency spokesman in Nigeria says Friday's collapse at a church complex in Lagos
    <br>killed at least 42 people.
    <br>As many as 130 others may have been pulled from the rubble of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>Look at what is happening here.
    <br>You will not see it on national TV, but if you learn that they bombed here now,
    <br>one of you will call CNN that they have bombed The SCOAN.
    <br>All that is happening, you will never see it on the pages of national newspapers, or international.
    <br>You will never see it - every good thing.
    <br>But if anything bad happens in front of the church, one of you Nigerians will be the one to make a call.
    <br>You are destroying your country, selling your country at nothing.
    <br>It is a very painful thing.
    <br>You are the ones destroying your country, you, Nigerians.
    <br>The image you are giving to your country is bad.
    <br>You destroy your image.
    <br>You say your nation is bad, everything is bad - the good is bad.
    <br>I am telling you something far
    <br>but now I am telling you something as close as my mouth.
    <br>One thing is clear, I have never seen where a lie overcomes truth.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>I have never seen where a lie overcomes truth.
    <br>Truth will always prevail.
    <br>I pray, Father, let Your will be done, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's listen to some structural and civil engineers from international bodies
    <br>who inspected the foundations of The SCOAN building in the aftermath of the incident
    <br>and gave their professional views.
    <br>I am Dr Stephen Asheri Ntoga.
    <br>I am a civil engineer, a structural engineer and a materials engineer.
    <br>I have lectured in many universities and even now, I am still a lecturer.
    <br>I happen to also be a Dean of the Faculty of Engineering in Tanzania.
    <br>I come from Tanzania.
    <br>The subjects that I teach are exactly on these structures.
    <br>I studied in Europe; I taught in Europe.
    <br>I came here in the year 2005.
    <br>I also know the regulations of construction.
    <br>What really happens in a country like Nigeria, even in Tanzania,
    <br>is that they use the so-called 'British Standard' in concrete structures.
    <br>I also know that if officially, a recognised company takes up a job like this, it has to be up to the standard.
    <br>I also know the British codes.
    <br>I can talk a lot about this.
    <br>What happened in this building, as I can see, the interaction between this foundation base
    <br>and the soil has opened up so wide that even if the soil was of low strength,
    <br>then actually, it will still have an excellent response.
    <br>In other words, the soil will have just like a touch.
    <br>It means that there was no suppression of the foundation.
    <br>This is why, as you can see, the foundation itself is healthy.
    <br>This type of steel is the type that is of the highest strength in the world.
    <br>I studied in a European continental programme type of education
    <br>from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.
    <br>So, I know this type of steel is the best steel that you can ever have.
    <br>As one of my colleagues said, these columns are more than six.
    <br>Even the cross-section of this steel is just too much.
    <br>Also, if you observe this one here, from the foundation to this height,
    <br>it means there was interconnection between the foundation
    <br>and into the upper continuation of the column joining the structure with the beams that were up there.
    <br>This means that there were even more reinforcements than just these that you are seeing.
    <br>This kind of material, that is used for what we call stirrups or rings, ties these.
    <br>This is a ten - Y10.
    <br>Y10 means that it is actually ten millimetres.
    <br>Standardly, we use six; this is ten.
    <br>I am talking here because I am a university lecturer.
    <br>I prepare and groom engineers who want to get their degrees.
    <br>I have even done a lot of research and supervised people who were doing their Masters and Doctorates
    <br>so, I know what I am saying.
    <br>Come to this material, this beam.
    <br>It is the beam interconnecting that foundation and the other one -
    <br>an extra effort made by the company that built it.
    <br>Normally, this kind of thing can be put in a super-sensitive foundation
    <br>in terms of an area or zone that has got high levels of earthquake effects.
    <br>I can also see the materials used in terms of aggregate.
    <br>These are called aggregates.
    <br>There are different sizes that were used.
    <br>Precisely because of this kind of diversification of the aggregates, it simply means this -
    <br>that actually, there was an interweaving of these materials.
    <br>Concrete, as a brittle material, was well interwoven together with the aggregates that are big.
    <br>Then come the smaller sizes of the aggregates, then the sand,
    <br>then the cement which is a paste that interweaves the concrete itself.
    <br>As I am seeing here, the way it is compacted means that it is super perfect -
    <br>the extent of the degree of effectiveness in the excellence of the construction of this building.
    <br>How high do you think this building, looking at the foundations, could go?
    <br>With this kind of foundation, it could go to even more than twelve storeys.
    <br>I have seen the building as it was being shown.
    <br>I saw the height between one floor and the other ones.
    <br>The higher the height between one floor and another, the more resistant to destruction the structure is.
    <br>This structure, this building, had that quality.
    <br>This happening could only have been done as a preplanned arrangement
    <br>by knowledgeable people like me.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because we as civil engineers in Civil Engineering are even taught how to demolish buildings.
    <br>There are methodologies that we are taught officially and we teach how to do this job.
    <br>One of the characters that is within that kind of knowledge is, whenever you are doing this,
    <br>you must make sure that the building has to fall within its plot.
    <br>In other words, within its own foundations.
    <br>It is like making the building kneel down just like that and very quickly.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because you actually strike artificially at where this material is brittle.
    <br>Brittle means it is not ductile.
    <br>Brittle means that it doesn't have tensile strength in this manner to elongate.
    <br>If you get chalk and put tension on it, it will just go.
    <br>It will just crack very suddenly without extending.
    <br>We know that you start with this type of material.
    <br>You weaken it very quickly.
    <br>In the process, as you weaken it very quickly,
    <br>the whole building will rest on only one thing - that is the steel.
    <br>Yet the design considers the interworking of the two materials, concrete and steel, as one.
    <br>This is the thing.
    <br>When you take away one material, you accumulate everything on this.
    <br>That is why these had to sink, because they are alone.
    <br>Immediately, the building has to kneel down very quickly.
    <br>The process that we use is once you detonate somewhere, it goes in seconds.
    <br>I can say even more, but not to exhaust you, this is all I have to say. Thank you.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>If you can see the size of the iron rods - the size is Y20.
    <br>The ring that gathered the rods together is Y10.
    <br>You see that the base still remains the same without tilting to one side or the other.
    <br>My name is Alpheus Mamafa from South Africa.
    <br>I did Civil Engineering and specialised in buildings.
    <br>Most buildings are being constructed using Y12.
    <br>These are Y20 - the strongest.
    <br>If you can check the type of reinforcement -
    <br>usually there are about six in a column, but this is more than six.
    <br>It is up to ten reinforcements - the strongest reinforcements that we get in the business.
    <br>This is the strongest column that you will ever get.
    <br>Nothing will shake this.
    <br>As you can see with these reinforcements, you can't shake them, especially when there is concrete inside.
    <br>Concrete makes it stronger.
    <br>Concrete by itself is so strong, but what about with these reinforcements?
    <br>It means you can't shake it any more.
    <br>You can see on the ground, there is a concrete reinforcement.
    <br>The concrete reinforcement is so strong - this beam.
    <br>Structural failure will always happen on the foundations.
    <br>That's why there is no building that can be constructed without inspectors checking the foundations.
    <br>If there is a crack on the foundations, it is a structural failure because of the weight that is coming from above.
    <br>Here, you find no crack on anything; it is so strong.
    <br>I don't see any structural failure on this building.
    <br>My name is Thabo Pheeha from South Africa.
    <br>I am qualified as a Civil Engineering Technician and a candidate as an Engineering Technician with Axa.
    <br>From my observation of what I have seen of the exposed foundations,
    <br>basically when a structure is failing, you will also notice from the foundations that the structure is failing.
    <br>By merely looking at the bases that are exposed from the entire building,
    <br>you can see that the bases are still firm and standing.
    <br>For the columns, you can see the amount of reinforcement that has been used here.
    <br>The concrete can also be tested but from seeing the columns and the bases on the side,
    <br>it shows that most of them were still intact after the collapse of the building.
    <br>According to my own observation, I believe that the structure has been affected in a different way,
    <br>other than structural failure.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's now hear from one of the international news journalists
    <br>who flew in to cover the aftermath of the event.
    <br>Take your time to watch the rest on the Internet.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>11:30 am - a military aircraft flies at low altitude over the church precinct.
    <br>11:43 am - another aircraft along a similar flight path.
    <br>11:45 am - it happens again.
    <br>11:54 am - the plane circles for a fourth time at low altitude.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>12:44 pm- the building collapses.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>This is The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>It is a Sunday morning.
    <br>It is packed full of people
    <br>and surrounded by The Synagogue are a number of hostels and accommodation facilities
    <br>for people who come to the church.
    <br>It is literally 20 meters away from where the building collapsed on 12th September 2014.
    <br>The building precinct is heavily guarded 24 hours a day.
    <br>Apart from some of the initial rubble being removed, the site has not been touched since the incident happened.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>There are two very opposing theories on what happened on 12th September 2014.
    <br>Here we are outside The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>It is a Sunday morning here, so it is a busy time on the streets of Lagos.
    <br>We are standing literally at the scene where almost exactly a year ago, at this building,
    <br>the guest house outside The SCOAN, 118 people lost their lives,
    <br>and also including 85 South Africans.
    <br>We are here and we want to talk to one of the guys who wrote a paper about the possible reasons
    <br>behind what happened that infamous day.
    <br>Paul Iguniwei is standing with me now
    <br>and he published a journal paper talking about the concept of infrasonic weapons.
    <br>He is going to take me through the science.
    <br>He has studied the science closely in the days and weeks after the incident,
    <br>and he is going to take me through the basis of the paper that he wrote.
    <br>Paul, welcome to ANN7. Thanks very much for joining us.
    <br>Just take us through what your basic findings were when you first came to the scene.
    <br>Having studied the CCTV,
    <br>I discovered that the plane kept flying over where we are standing - where the building was.
    <br>And it flew four different times
    <br>and after the fourth time the plane flew over,
    <br>about 30 minutes later the building came down.
    <br>The interesting thing is - why would a plane keep flying over the building in a manner that seems consistent
    <br>with trying to induce or trying to fire a kind of infrasonic weapon?
    <br>This is of course what I published and it was accepted to be so.
    <br>Having gone through that, I came to the conclusion that the plane carried an infrasonic generator,
    <br>which consistently fired pulses of the infra-sound over the building.
    <br>And it needed to give enough intensity of doses.
    <br>That is why it kept coming back.
    <br>Interestingly, immediately after the building came down, the plane never came back again.
    <br>So, let's assume that the plane was on a routine fly-over.
    <br>After the building came down, why did the plane not continue?
    <br>Local structural engineers independent to the church have studied the site and gave us their conclusions.
    <br>Anybody that watches the footage will see the building come down like a slice of bread.
    <br>The building of six storeys came down without tilting to the left or right.
    <br>And with any structural failure, you have to know the point of the load
    <br>- maybe the weight of the building would go to that side -
    <br>but in this case, everything came down within seconds.
    <br>Anyone coming here will see that the surrounding structures are intact.
    <br>The theory of infrasonic weapons - I would briefly like to know your thoughts on this
    <br>and the damage it could cause to a building such as this.
    <br>Some scientists are saying that if they planted something inside the building,
    <br>you would see evidence of the chemical reaction, but in this case we don't see any chemical reaction.
    <br>But we are still seeing that the plane flew over four times.
    <br>The building didn't have any signs of stress or cracking; it stood firm.
    <br>But after the plane flew over four times, within about 30 minutes the building came down
    <br>and the plane did not come back again.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>The focus for the church is the government planes that flew over the building on the morning of the incident.
    <br>The response from the government was that routine Nigerian Air Force training
    <br>coincidentally took place that morning.
    <br>Are you saying that somebody in Nigeria possesses infrasonic weapons
    <br>that could have brought this building down?
    <br>I wouldn't know if it was somebody in Nigeria or somebody outside Nigeria.
    <br>These are weapons of international dimensions.
    <br>It could have been that it was brought from outside the country, perhaps to test.
    <br>There is a lot of weapons testing and sometimes people are not aware.
    <br>I will give an example: Some years ago the Americans were testing this same kind of weapon - another generic -
    <br>sonic weapons in one of the islands and all the dolphins in the ocean were dying and washing up ashore.
    <br>That is not my business - it is the business of the government to make sure properly what happened here.
    <br>Mine is to show that this is what happened,
    <br>and I think I have done that with people who have never met me and who are better experts in this field.
    <br>As you say, you are a scientist.
    <br>Looking at how buildings get demolished - controlled demolitions - this looks almost exactly the same.
    <br>Can you categorically say that there were no explosives found in this building
    <br>and that it must have been done from the air?
    <br>There are certain misconceptions we need to educate non-scientists about concerning controlled demolitions.
    <br>'Controlled demolition' means that it is controlled by humans.
    <br>In using explosives for controlled demolitions, you want to achieve an aim.
    <br>The aim is to transfer the energy of the explosives into the building to bring the building down.
    <br>What happened here is similar in the sense that infrasonic energy was transferred into the building.
    <br>It is just that the methods differ.
    <br>In the traditional case, you place explosives; that cannot be done clandestinely.
    <br>If that was the case, there would have been chemical signatures that we would have seen.
    <br>Like I said, the tent behind us now would not have been standing.
    <br>The building came down in one go, silently.
    <br>That is why I am insisting.
    <br>Again, the way the building came down - the building came down directly vertically.
    <br>The videos are all over the Internet of how buildings come down when it is as a result of
    <br>poor construction methods or poor materials.
    <br>Such buildings always tilt,
    <br>but this building did not tilt - it just sat on itself.
    <br>CONTROLLED DEMOLITION
    <br>COLLAPSE BY STRUCTURAL FAILURE
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>When I presented that at the Coroner's Court,
    <br>they didn't believe that I was going to do what I said I was going to do.
    <br>Like I said, I kept insisting; I am a scientist, I am not a member of this church.
    <br>I was interested for the fact that this is what I was doing when I worked with the government.
    <br>I worked with the government in the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria
    <br>where we produce weapons for the country.
    <br>That background made me suspect that this is what happened.
    <br>If the plane actually flew according to that level, would our CCTV camera be able to capture it?
    <br>That is part of the question we want to iron out before giving a verdict.
    <br>Were there not questions asked of where the plane took off from?
    <br>Surely the flight details for every single flight are documented 
    <br>- where it takes off from,
    <br>what is the purpose of its travel,
    <br>who is on board.
    <br>Is that not going to be investigated?
    <br>No, they were unable to do that because the plane had to do with the military.
    <br>Nobody came to give details about that;
    <br>they couldn't produce who the occupants were, for security reasons because it was a military plane.
    <br>For security reasons, nobody was able to provide that aspect.
    <br>Nobody came; that is part of the question.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>Another interesting aspect of the collapse of the guest house here at The SCOAN
    <br>was how the building actually collapsed - it literally imploded.
    <br>There are a number of issues, instances on the ground that you can see.
    <br>This is a cold room here that is along the line of the actual building itself,
    <br>no more than two meters away from this cold room,
    <br>and it wasn't damaged at all.
    <br>They have left it here to show you how it came down completely without touching anything around it.
    <br>It is bizarre.
    <br>This is the line of the end of The SCOAN guest house and this is the cold room
    <br>and it literally hasn't been touched.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>The SCOAN actually own eleven of their own ambulances.
    <br>This is their fleet behind me here; there are eleven of them.
    <br>They were purchased a few months before 12th September last year.
    <br>Generally the ambulances are used in the community in the surrounding areas to assist
    <br>with sick, injured or elderly patients.
    <br>But on that day, 12th September, these ambulances were used to transport
    <br>those injured in that building collapse to the local hospitals.
    <br>Many people say it was the Prophet's intuition, that he knew that something was coming,
    <br>and so all of a sudden one day eleven ambulances arrived on the premises.
    <br>They were used in good force.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>I am sitting here in amongst the rangled mess that was the guest house at The SCOAN in Lagos.
    <br>It is an eerie place, considering the deaths that occurred on 12th September 2014.
    <br>There were a lot of people inside the building who didn't lose their lives.
    <br>A lot of staff members worked in the building as well.
    <br>I am chatting to someone here who works at The SCOAN.
    <br>We are literally sitting on the place where he was when the building collapsed.
    <br>He is going to tell us a bit about that experience.
    <br>We appreciate your time.
    <br>Take us through what happened that day.
    <br>When you woke up, what happened?
    <br>Just like every other day, when it is time for visitors to have their food,
    <br>so, it was about lunchtime on that particular day.
    <br>I was getting ready, making sure everything was in place for the visitors to enjoy their food.
    <br>Before I knew it, I looked up and there was a sound accompanied with my movement - (loud noises).
    <br>It was so fast at the wall; it went so fast.
    <br>It caught my attention, because being a peaceful environment, my mind was at rest.
    <br>I looked and followed the sound and before I knew it - bang - it just started coming down so fast.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>I was standing upright just where we are
    <br>and it pushed me down and knocked me to the floor.
    <br>That was all I remember; I blacked out.
    <br>By the time I regained consciousness, I found myself under a chair; I had been pushed underneath.
    <br>I was stuck. I couldn't move to the left or right.
    <br>I was just stuck there, surrounded by sharp objects,
    <br>because the chairs and tables which were there had broken and they became sharp.
    <br>So, I was surrounded with these.
    <br>After a while, because I had my phone in my pocket,
    <br>the first thing that came to mind was to try to reach people.
    <br>But there was no signal
    <br>because everything had come down and all the beams had become like a barrier, with no signal going through.
    <br>And everywhere was completely dark.
    <br>You couldn't breathe properly.
    <br>How I managed was all by God's grace.
    <br>I give thanks to God because from nowhere, as I lay down there, droplets of water came,
    <br>hitting my forehead and on my lips.
    <br>It felt as if I was drinking an ocean of water.
    <br>The visitors as well who were trapped there were in high spirits.
    <br>That in itself was so motivational.
    <br>The circumstances around us were not encouraging, but they were all in high spirits
    <br>and they were praying to God, which I did join them.
    <br>They were giving thanks.
    <br>There was a particular lady who was leading them in songs of worship and praise, and I joined them.
    <br>Sometimes they would shout for help and the time passed.
    <br>Before we knew it, we were being pulled out one by one and I myself was being pulled out.
    <br>Like I said, to God be the glory, there were people on site who were ready to help.
    <br>I was whisked away into the ambulance and taken.
    <br>By that time, my eyes were partially open and I was looking around trying to observe.
    <br>I was taken to hospital and the recovery started, and here I am today giving thanks to Almighty God.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>As you know, the devastating effect that The SCOAN guest house collapse had on South Africans - 
    <br>it certainly was an emotional time.
    <br>There were 85 South Africans inside this building when it collapsed,
    <br>which raises a number of questions as to how popular The SCOAN is amongst South Africans
    <br>and how many travel up here.
    <br>I am sitting with Kulani. Her dad passed away in that incident.
    <br>And also Blessing is sitting over there. His mother was a bishop,
    <br>and she passed away during that building collapse.
    <br>We are going to get a bit of an insight into the families -
    <br>how they are doing now, how they were and their involvement in the church at the moment.
    <br>Kulani, tell us what transpired - why was your dad here and how did you hear about what happened?
    <br>My dad was here for spiritual upliftment.
    <br>He came here, it was on the 11th of September last year, and then the building collapsed on the 12th,
    <br>but I didn't find out at that time; I was writing my final year in high school, doing my matric.
    <br>So we actually found out after a week that it happened.
    <br>I couldn't believe it, thinking it could never happen to The SCOAN.
    <br>DOCUMENTARY: The Day The SCOAN Was ATTACKED!!!
    <br>Before my mum left, I was at school doing my matric.
    <br>The day before she left, she left a message to the whole family; I was there.
    <br>She said to my sister, "I'm going right now and if I don't come back, just look after the kids.
    <br>Make sure they do well at church, and my kids should do very well in school. God will be with you."
    <br>So then after the incident had happened, I remembered that my mum would usually
    <br>talk about such a day that would come.
    <br>She would always tell us, "When a day like this comes, you should know that I'm going to my comfort zone.
    <br>You should rejoice; don't start complaining. Where I am is where God has assigned me to be."
    <br>Do you ever question what happened?
    <br>Everything happens for a reason.
    <br>I don't question what happened because I know that my mum came here for a good reason.
    <br>As we all know, this is the arena of liberty.
    <br>She had come here to seek God's presence, to experience the love of God,
    <br>and she would usually come here and go back home with her life changed.
    <br>Things would just turn around for everyone, not only for our families but for other families out there.
    <br>She played a very important role in influencing or in teaching other people out there to seek God first.
    <br>As we mark one year since the devastating building collapse here at The SCOAN,
    <br>more questions than answers remain.
    <br>The truth of the story is that 85 South Africans lost their lives in this devastating attack.
    <br>I am Peter Van Onselen in Lagos for ANN7.
    <br>One thing is clear - I have never seen where a lie overcomes truth.
    <br>Truth will always prevail.
    <br>One thing is clear - I have never seen where a lie overcome truth. Truth will always prevail.
    <br>Emmanuel! Good morning.
    <br>My name is Jonty Cloete and I am from South Africa.
    <br>I have a medical background on ambulances.
    <br>I was a visitor at the time.
    <br>I went over to the gates and reported myself to help on the medical team.
    <br>I was allocated to the rescue team.
    <br>As always, the church team was very organised.
    <br>I was told exactly where to operate, where the medical tent was.
    <br>By that time, there was already a medical tent set up in the adjacent canopy.
    <br>All the medical supplies were there and ready.
    <br>That canopy across from the building that had collapsed was set up as a medical tent
    <br>and a clinic was there and there were a lot of sisters ready
    <br>and they were able to handle the medical situations.
    <br>Fifteen minutes earlier, pictures were taken of the building and then suddenly it was just there,
    <br>just on top of itself.
    <br>The Red Cross were here to help us; they were everywhere.
    <br>I was glad and happy to know that the church is here to save lives.
    <br>While the governmental organisations came in and started taking decisions
    <br>and organising themselves, the church people were running everywhere,
    <br>getting the tools in and bringing the excavators in.
    <br>Within the first few hours, I saw a full blown rescue operation in progress.
    <br>It was amazing to see.
    <br>Sometimes I just stood back and said, "What is this, God?"
    <br>It was if He had prepared everybody.
    <br>Eleven ambulances came in - not from the government, the Red Cross brought one -
    <br>but the church had 11 ambulances in a queue waiting.
    <br>Because of that, we were able to bring the people out one by one into an ambulance
    <br>and they were taken off to hospital.
    <br>The government organisations did not have any ambulance to add to the picture;
    <br>they admitted that, for their own reasons.
    <br>Those are the organisations that are supposed to have the equipment ready for national disasters.
    <br>This is a national disaster. Actually for me, it's an international disaster.
    <br>It was very strange for me to see all these ambulances.
    <br>I saw them in February 2014 when I was here.
    <br>I couldn't understand why the church would have 11 ambulances -
    <br>brand new, fully equipped, state of the art, part of the fleet.
    <br>I didn't understand and I was told that the Prophet had a revelation to buy and equip them
    <br>as there would be a time where he would donate them to the State to handle situations that might come.
    <br>When it happened, the ambulances were here immediately!
    <br>It was divine - this is God for you.
    <br>From there on, it went like that night after night.
    <br>The church people and all the volunteers never stopped working.
    <br>Throughout the night the floodlights were on; it continued right through the night.
    <br>The next morning, it was the same thing.
    <br>After that, the site was cleared and we could say for sure that no one
    <br>was actually left here on the site and all the bodies had been discovered.
    <br>I was very touched by this operation here at The SCOAN.
    <br>And, I will keep on coming by the grace of God.
    <br>After that, we came back many times; this is the 5th visit now.
    <br>We thank God for everything.
    <br>A last word to our people that are in their countries, including South Africa -
    <br>so many people have made up their minds about what happened here without having the correct knowledge.
    <br>They looked at the situation and because of things that they heard
    <br>and things that they were told, they made their assumptions.
    <br>I know and have seen hundreds of people realising their mistakes now, three or four months after the incident.
    <br>Those people are saying, "We can see why you are going back".
    <br>That is what rejoices my heart.
    <br>We have seen and we are challenging you, come and see for yourself
    <br>and you will be blessed like we are blessed.
    <br>If God allowed this thing to happen to His servant, He must have a brilliant plan.

    <br>The Foundations Of The Building
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith Visit The Site Of The September 12th Incident
    <br>Viewers, good morning to you all.
    <br>We are here at The SCOAN at the site of the incident that happened on September 12th, 2014.
    <br>Behind me are the families of the Martyrs of Faith.
    <br>Amongst them are husbands, wives, children, sisters and brothers
    <br>of those who were affected by the incident on September 12th, 2014.
    <br>They are here today to see for themselves at the site of the incident and to share their experiences.
    <br>Let us be blessed as we listen to their experiences, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Good morning. Emmanuel!
    <br>I thank God for being here.
    <br>My name is Thembeihle Mamafa, I come from South Africa and next to me is my son.
    <br>I would like to share what happened to me.
    <br>We arrived on Wednesday 10th;
    <br>my husband was coming here for the third time. His name is Robert Mamafa.
    <br>We came with his younger sister as well, Magdeline Maponya.
    <br>I was coming here for the second time and for his sister, it was the first time.
    <br>He said to us on the morning of the Thursday, with excitement that,
    <br>"We are here as a family but we are not here as a family spiritually
    <br>because we are here for different reasons spiritually and each person has a plan of what they are here for".
    <br>On the Friday of the accident in the morning, before I woke up,
    <br>my sister-in-law woke up in the middle of the night - I don't know what time it was.
    <br>She just said to me, "Let's go quickly to the church".
    <br>I said to her, "What time is it?"
    <br>She said, "I don't know, but I feel like we need to go to the church".
    <br>I said, "No. Go and bath first and then I will follow you".
    <br>She woke up and took a bath - it was around 1am or 2am.
    <br>She came back and saw that I was not waking up so she went back to bed.
    <br>When I woke up at 5 am, I took a bath and then she followed me.
    <br>When we got to the church, I was saying to God that I wanted to read the Bible first before I did anything.
    <br>I said to Him, "Where do You want me to start? What do You want me to read?"
    <br>God said to me, "Read the Book of Job".
    <br>I started reading the Bible and I read about 25 chapters until 8 am and then we were coming back for breakfast.
    <br>That was when I met my husband, because we had said we would meet each other only in the dining hall.
    <br>In that morning, my sister-in-law said she was not feeling okay.
    <br>She never even ate breakfast.
    <br>In my heart I was so excited.
    <br>I wanted to tell my husband about me reading so many chapters of the Bible -
    <br>I wanted to share with him what I had read.
    <br>But something was holding me and I said I would find another time to tell him.
    <br>We had breakfast and then we went to church for the Bible study.
    <br>At about 11am, my sister-in-law came to us and said,
    <br>"As I said in the morning, I am not feeling okay.
    <br>I want to go to where we are staying [which was the building here] and I want to take a nap".
    <br>She gave me her Bible and book and said she was going and would see us during lunch.
    <br>That was the last time I saw her.
    <br>I stayed with my husband and we continued with the session till 12:30 pm, which was the break time.
    <br>I love the food that is cooked here so I don't normally miss the meals.
    <br>But for some reason, at that particular time, I felt hot air in my stomach and immediately I felt full.
    <br>I said to my husband, "I'm not going to join you. I'm feeling fine;
    <br>I've got snacks here with me, so I'm not going to go.
    <br>I am going to eat snacks, so I will see you when you come back for the next Bible session".
    <br>I even said to him, "My husband, you said to me that we are not going to have family time here,
    <br>we are only here for our spiritual growth and spiritual lessons."
    <br>I said to him, "I have got snacks here with me, stay with me,
    <br>don't go for lunch so that we can be alone and have time for ourselves"
    <br>and he sat with me maybe for five to ten minutes before the incident
    <br>and just when we were busy chatting about our family and everything,
    <br>he just stood up in a flash and said, "You know what, I am going to go for a full meal.
    <br>I am not going to sit here for your snacks; I am going to the dining hall. I will see you when I come back".
    <br>He stood up just like that and gave me a hug and a kiss and told me that he loved me and then he left.
    <br>As I opened the Bible, I heard a voice say to me, "No, leave the Book of Job and read Psalm 23".
    <br>I said, "Okay because I can hear that this is You, God".
    <br>Then, I started reading Psalm 23.
    <br>So, I believe that the accident happened at that time when I was reading Psalm 23.
    <br>I was meditating on it when the incident happened.
    <br>I was not even aware of what was happening.
    <br>I was sitting right where people left us.
    <br>Immediately, I could see people rushing in and I could see the commotion at the gate
    <br>and that was when I left everything and went to see what was going on.
    <br>By that time the rescue mission had started and that was the last time I saw my family.
    <br>I felt bad but it was amazing, the strength of God that I received during that particular time.
    <br>I was not afraid and I felt my spiritual life, instead of it going down, it went up.
    <br>I felt myself getting closer to God.
    <br>I thank God that during that time, He has given us so much strength
    <br>and we have managed to take the situation well - the whole family.
    <br>He has been really carrying us through
    <br>and we thank the church as well for everything that they have done.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet TB Joshua, has done so much
    <br>and we really appreciate everything from the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>We've been able to carry on up until now when I came back.
    <br>There is another thing I would like to share.
    <br>Just before we left South Africa to come here on the 10th,
    <br>my husband was having strange dreams of death.
    <br>He said to me, "The things I am dreaming, they will scare you.
    <br>I am looking forward to going to The SCOAN to meet the Prophet
    <br>and discuss them with him because I also don't understand much of them".
    <br>He shared a few with me.
    <br>He once woke up in the morning and said,
    <br>"I'm feeling that here in the family, there is somebody very, very close
    <br>to us that is not going to be alive in 2016".
    <br>I was at that time scared of death.
    <br>I tried to push that subject away and I would tell him, "You are starting your stories".
    <br>He said, "No, 2016 is very far; this person will not reach 2015".
    <br>He said that we needed to start our plans and do something about it.
    <br>Three days before we came, he woke up again and said this time,
    <br>"I woke up in the night. Just before I woke up, I dreamt of something strange - this thing that happened.
    <br>I was in a building I didn't know and something fell from the sky.
    <br>When this thing fell from the sky, it made a big bang sound
    <br>when it reached the ground and immediately when that happened something raised me from the bottom,
    <br>it was like a parachute that took me from the bottom and shot me straight to the sky".
    <br>He said that when he was in the sky, he saw a light, a big light and
    <br>while he was still wondering what was happening to him, the very same thing brought him back to earth.
    <br>In a minute, in a flash, he was back again on the ground.
    <br>He said that was when he woke up.
    <br>I couldn't understand what he was saying
    <br>because he had told me that he had been dreaming a lot about death.
    <br>I was saying to him, "Let's not worry, we are going to The SCOAN.
    <br>We are going to see the Prophet and we will discuss those dreams with him".
    <br>I felt that I needed to share this with everybody
    <br>because I feel that he saw something and something that was about to come.
    <br>I only realised it myself just after the incident that it was actually what he was dreaming about.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>What I have learnt from this experience and this incident is that
    <br>we really need to live each day as if it were our last day.
    <br>For me and my family, this has really drawn us closer to God.
    <br>We are not afraid of death any more because we are living each day as if it were our last.
    <br>The death of our family members, both my husband and his sister,
    <br>has brought the light to the family; it has brought us closer together.
    <br>We really know they did not die in vain
    <br>and we can see the manifestation of God in our lives at this point.
    <br>Another thing I would like to highlight is that my husband was not afraid of death himself.
    <br>He was talking of Heaven as if it was his home and he was ready to go any time;
    <br>he would say it openly, publicly, and he longed to be there.
    <br>My name is Phindile Sibanyoni from South Africa.
    <br>On the day of the incident, I was sitting with my husband at the table, waiting to be served our food.
    <br>While we were still sitting, I could hear a thunderstorm.
    <br>It was like it was going to rain.
    <br>We were sitting facing this direction.
    <br>Then I looked at the back because there was a window on this side.
    <br>I looked through the window thinking maybe I would see clouds.
    <br>That's when I saw the cracks.
    <br>The cracks were so fast.
    <br>I looked at my husband; he looked at me.
    <br>We didn't know what to say.
    <br>Then all of a sudden, it was dark.
    <br>We were on the floor.
    <br>I slept, facing the upward position.
    <br>Then after a few seconds, I woke up on something.
    <br>I called my husband, asking whether he was fine.
    <br>He told me that he was fine, that he was not scratched.
    <br>Then we started praying, thanking God for saving us from that incident.
    <br>The slab gave us a very short distance just for us to be in,
    <br>to be kept underneath without any scratch or whatever.
    <br>He said everything to me and told me that I must make sure, through thick and thin,
    <br>that I keep my heart pure before God and do not spoil the relationship that I have with God.
    <br>Then, he passed away.
    <br>That was when I was rescued and I was taken to a hospital.
    <br>After a while, I was denying that he had passed away.
    <br>I thought he was going to come back to life.
    <br>When I came back from the hospital on that evening, I was asking myself where he was.
    <br>I was asking everyone where my husband was taken,
    <br>but nobody could know because people were taken to different hospitals.
    <br>Then I spent some days not knowing.
    <br>On Tuesday when I went to the altar to pray that God should rescue my husband wherever he was,
    <br>immediately I arrived at the altar, I fell asleep.
    <br>All of a sudden, I heard my husband talking in my left ear.
    <br>He was talking to someone else; he was not talking to me.
    <br>He said, "Did you say this was Ruth? Do you mean Ruth or Naomi?"
    <br>Then all of a sudden, I saw three white women sitting on my right hand side.
    <br>They were facing that direction; i could see them on the side.
    <br>The one who was Ruth had grey hair and was sitting, facing the other side.
    <br>Then all of a sudden, I woke up from that dream.
    <br>Then I realised that my husband was no more in this world.
    <br>Ruth and Naomi are no longer in this world; they are above.
    <br>Before we came to the service, God was taking me through the Scripture
    <br>where I could read about Naomi and the pain Naomi went through
    <br>when she went to Moab with her husband and came back alone.
    <br>I was feeling the pain for Naomi but all of a sudden, after that revelation came,
    <br>it was when I knew that my husband was no longer in this world.
    <br>Then on Wednesday, it was confirmed to me and I went back home.
    <br>I thank God for everything because I realise the love of God for me.
    <br>If the day of my husband was going to arrive while we were at home in South Africa,
    <br>I don't think my husband would be at home with God.
    <br>Maybe he would be somewhere else.
    <br>I thank God that He made it possible that we were here and that he is there.
    <br>In whatever I was going through, the only words that could keep me going
    <br>were the words that were said by my husband before his passing, that
    <br>"Through thick and thin, make sure that you do not lose the special relationship you have with God".
    <br>I thank you.
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith Visit The Site Of The September 12th Incident
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Veronica Mathebula from South Africa.
    <br>I was not in the building when it collapsed.
    <br>I heard this big sound.
    <br>I stood up and when I stood up, I walked around.
    <br>When I looked at the road, there was no accident.
    <br>I asked, "What is going on here?"
    <br>When I raised my eyes and looked this side, I just saw dust and I said to myself,
    <br>"That is where my husband is and that is where my uncle is".
    <br>My mind just locked; I could not think any more.
    <br>I started praying, "God, I know You are sending Your angels right now.
    <br>You are helping everyone there. No one must die. Save my husband, save my uncle".
    <br>That was my prayer.
    <br>I could not believe my husband had passed away.
    <br>I thought he was one of the people who went to hospital and would come back.
    <br>I stayed in the church for two weeks.
    <br>I went everywhere.
    <br>When I was sleeping one day, I had a dream.
    <br>He came to me but when he came, he was not alone.
    <br>He was with someone; I don't know the person he was with -
    <br>he was holding his hand.
    <br>But to me, it looked like one of the evangelists I don't even know.
    <br>I said to him, "Moora", because I used to call him Moora, "Where were you? I have been looking for you.
    <br>Come, let's go home because your parents, your family are complaining".
    <br>He said to me, "I am not going back with you".
    <br>I asked, "What do you mean, you are not going back with me?
    <br>We have to go; remember our son. What am I going to tell him? He is only a few months old".
    <br>He said, "No, don't worry about our son".
    <br>I asked, "Who is going to take care of him?"
    <br>He was with this guy and he let go of his hand.
    <br>It was like he took a big bag of money.
    <br>He said, "Do you see this money? We will take care of our child. Never worry about anything".
    <br>I asked, "What do I tell your parents when I get home?".
    <br>He said, "Don't worry; where I am, I am at peace.
    <br>So you have to go; you cannot be where I am. You have to live".
    <br>I said, "No, I can't go home without you; we have to go back together".
    <br>He said, "No, this is how it is supposed to be. I have to be where I am and you have to go home".
    <br>I went back home.
    <br>What happened on that day, for me, those people who passed on,
    <br>they could have passed on anywhere, wherever they were coming from.
    <br>But because God's grace is enough for all of us sinners,
    <br>that is why I tell people that I believe I am special to God.
    <br>Although I am a sinner, I am super special because my husband did not die in South Africa.
    <br>He died in the House of God, but not just any House of God -
    <br>where there is a true man of God who has a vision.
    <br>If you check what is currently happening, the families and everyone are worried, they are saying a lot of things,
    <br>but it's not about death.
    <br>What matters is where they went.
    <br>A night before the incident, something just told me to go and pray.
    <br>I prayed an unusual prayer - longer than normal.
    <br>I asked God, "God, why am I praying so differently?" -
    <br>because I know how I pray and I don't normally go this far.
    <br>I had to pray for my whole family, especially my husband.
    <br>My prayer was, "God, I pray that each and every family member,
    <br>before their time, let their names be written in the Book of Life
    <br>so that whenever You call them, their names are written in the Book of Life".
    <br>I asked myself why I was praying that kind of a prayer.
    <br>When I finished praying, I found my husband in church, reading the Bible.
    <br>I said, "God! You do things very fast!".
    <br>And I went to sleep.
    <br>As I went to sleep, I sent him an SMS.
    <br>I told my husband that since we met, I don't know, I might have done things intentionally which are wrong
    <br>according to the Word of God and some unaware.
    <br>Please forgive me for everything.
    <br>Let's pray for our son and for the salvation of our family members.
    <br>It was after midnight I fell asleep.
    <br>When I woke up in the morning on Friday before the incident, I saw an SMS and it said,
    <br>"This is the best place for spiritual upliftment but most of all, we must pray for the grace of our souls".
    <br>I said, "This man has repented. He is talking another language which I don't understand".
    <br>What matters, brethren, is where they are, not how they died.
    <br>And for me, I said to myself, "God, the time for crying has passed".
    <br>Where they are, we should ask ourselves,
    <br>"Are we going to get that grace that they received to get there?".
    <br>One day I was saying to God, "I think it's better to go there. Why didn't I die as well?".
    <br>But I remembered there is a reason; I don't know the reason.
    <br>Before the building collapsed, I wanted to go in but I did not.
    <br>So, there is a purpose for each and every one of those different types of categories
    <br>but what matters to all of us is, "Where do we fall?"
    <br>Are we going to listen to the voice of God and do what God wants us to do
    <br>or will we keep on talking about earthly things which don't matter?
    <br>I know it is because of grace.
    <br>So, all of us, brethren, I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ, let's pray for grace for  the salvation of our souls
    <br>because you don't know when you are going to die
    <br>but what matters is that we pray that our names will be written in the Book of Life, so that on that day...
    <br>Because we don't know what's going to happen.
    <br>You have seen the prophecies that the man of God gave - look what happened.
    <br>When you listen to the man of God and you see things happening,
    <br>then you understand that this man is not just an ordinary man.
    <br>When he prophesied about this year, he said it is a year of crossing the bridge.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Mwela Philip Mbezi from South Africa.
    <br>Brethren, I am going to be very short.
    <br>When I saw the building collapse, this is what came into my heart,
    <br>that I have a duty to clear the clouds that are hanging,
    <br>meaning what people were saying around this incident.
    <br>I remember when I was phoned and told that I needed to be interviewed.
    <br>The interview went like this.
    <br>They said, "What do you think? Who did this? Are you going to blame TB Joshua, the Prophet?".
    <br>I said, "We have got one enemy"
    <br>and this is what I want to tell you brethren, let us not lose focus.
    <br>We have got only one enemy.
    <br>I said to them, "You don't need an engineer to understand what happened,
    <br>that was a mere attack by the devil on the House of the Lord.
    <br>Unfortunately, satan has his lieutenants - his people who work with him.
    <br>It is not our duty to say who, but we know only the devil is our enemy".
    <br>Number one.
    <br>Now, the other thing that I said when I was asked,
    <br>"If you get an invitation to Lagos, are you going to accept it?".
    <br>I said, "The General Overseer of The SCOAN, Prophet TB Joshua, is my brother in Christ.
    <br>Whenever brothers meet, they encourage each other.
    <br>I am going to go there and get encouragement from him".
    <br>Now, people have got stories - let us not concentrate, let us not lose our focus;
    <br>we have got a Home where we are getting to.
    <br>I wish to be where my daughter is.
    <br>I lost a daughter, and the only one daughter, that I loved, Mpho Victoria.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Tobeka Masiba from the Eastern Cape, South Africa.
    <br>My husband was here.
    <br>I am so touched; I don't know where to start after those who spoke before me.
    <br>They have really touched me; I am very emotional.
    <br>I just want to give a summary.
    <br>We are here as the families of the generals of God,
    <br>the generals of the Kingdom of God.
    <br>We need not bluff ourselves;
    <br>we need to be honest to God and to ourselves.
    <br>The pain is there.
    <br>You have to go through it because if you behave as if nothing happened, you are lying to yourself.
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>Besides that, if you ask me, I also came here for my own personal healing.
    <br>Let me start by saying that when this incident happened on 12th September,
    <br>I spoke with my husband 30 minutes before.
    <br>It was 13:15 pm in South Africa and 12:15 pm in Nigeria.
    <br>I was speaking to him and he was asking me what I had done, as if he knew that he was coming.
    <br>On this Monday, I decided to write an email to the man of God.
    <br>My email was, "My faith is not shaken". I said, "I pray for you and your family at large.
    <br>If they call you names, they call me names too
    <br>and if it is God's will that my husband dies, then what else can I do?".
    <br>I said he can regard himself as a very fortunate person to die in the hands of God.
    <br>I am standing here today to witness what happened.
    <br>I want to talk to the families, like myself.
    <br>I think we are very fortunate to be here and to be part of the Martyrs of Faith.
    <br>Today, I said I am hurt.
    <br>If you look at what the Prophet has been doing for us since we have been here; that has touched me.
    <br>I wrote a text message to one of my friends saying,
    <br>"Does this mean that this is what my husband died for, to show me the love of God, what to expect from God?".
    <br>If I can ask you guys: can death really separate us from God?
    <br>Nothing can separate us from the love of God; that is why we are here.
    <br>If you can keep that in your mind, your life will never be the same again.
    <br>Today, I have got a Father of all fathers - Jesus, through the Prophet.
    <br>The devil wants us to lose focus.
    <br>They strike because they want us to lose focus.
    <br>I was playing these videos for people who didn't even understand.
    <br>Believe me, through this, so many people have joined Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Whether people liked it or not, whether you were an in-law or wherever you were coming from,
    <br>I had to stick to what I believed in.
    <br>I believe in Jesus and I believe in His Prophet.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Sonny Madzhie from South Africa.
    <br>I am the mother of one of the Martyrs of Faith.
    <br>I have got a message for all the Martyrs of Faith's families.
    <br>Two weeks before my daughter came here - she was 23 - we went on holiday in Mozambique.
    <br>We were staying on the 11th floor in that room.
    <br>Four years before that, we were staying in the same area in Mozambique.
    <br>We were staying in another hotel next to the one that we were in.
    <br>It was just two floors.
    <br>Then, we arrived late, around 11 o' clock on a Friday in Mozambique.
    <br>The following morning, she called me to her room and said, "Mummy, come and see!".
    <br>When I went, there was glass all over that accommodation.
    <br>She said I should come and see. I went to the room.
    <br>She said, "See where God is taking us".
    <br>She said, "Look, four years ago where we were".
    <br>She was showing me the previous hotel and said,
    <br>"Look at where God is taking us. God is taking us higher".
    <br>I marvelled and said, "We thank God".
    <br>I didn't understand.
    <br>The first time I came to The SCOAN, I didn't know the Prophet or The SCOAN.
    <br>I was just invited and when I went back home, on my arrival, I prayed and cried.
    <br>I said, "God, if You say You love us, how come we don't have the Prophet that I saw in Nigeria in our country?".
    <br>Last year, when Evangelist Upthegrove prophesied to the man of God,
    <br>he said, "The Lord is taking you to another level; be ready".
    <br>I said, "God, if You're taking the man of God to another level, do not pass me by; I want to go with him".
    <br>When I was taking my daughter to the airport, she wrote this SMS to me -
    <br>that was the last SMS that she sent to me - "Good morning".
    <br>I am sure she was saying, "Good morning" to all of you - the Martyrs of Faith.
    <br>So, get ready. It is a new dawn. Good morning!
    <br>She is saying to all the Martyrs of Faith's families, "Good morning; it is a new dawn".
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>My name is Wonder Ndlovu from South Africa.
    <br>I am here to testify of the goodness of God for the salvation of the soul of my husband, Mbongeni Ndlovu.
    <br>When he got here, he was not saved.
    <br>I had always been praying for him to get saved.
    <br>I had always told God, "Please, do not take him before he receives You as his Saviour".
    <br>When he left home, he said, "When I come back, I'm going to be a preacher".
    <br>But now, I want to share the messages that he sent while he was here.
    <br>On 12th September, at 11:30 am, he sent this message to his friend:
    <br>"God is showing His holy face to me and I feel blessed to be granted His grace.
    <br>I fully agree that His blood washed my sins away, my past is over, I'm a new creature.
    <br>I'm prepared to stay in His holiness until His second coming. Emmanuel. God is with us".
    <br>He sent to his brother, Veli, on the 11th of September at 8:30 am:
    <br>"Please tell Olady [Olady means mama] that I'm enjoying The SCOAN.
    <br>God's presence is all over. Emmanuel. If God is with us who can be against us?
    <br>Tell her I love her to bits".
    <br>This is another message that same day, the 11th, at 10:02 am:
    <br>"I'm experiencing God's manifestation upon my life. God is good all the time. Emmanuel".
    <br>Another message on the 12th at 10:27 am, sent to his first-born son:
    <br>"It's nice. I feel I can spend the rest of my God-given life here. Emmanuel".
    <br>This, he sent to his second-born Swakhile; he is here with me.
    <br>It was on that day, September 12th, at 8:31 am.
    <br>"The Lord Jesus died for our sins; what shall we give Him in return?".
    <br>And he called me while they were in that service; they were singing, "We are marching in the light of God".
    <br>They were singing in the background and he said,
    <br>"Mama Wonder, did you hear that? I'm marching in the light of God.
    <br>Bye bye; I just want you to know that I'm marching in the light of God".
    <br>We thank God for the salvation of his soul.
    <br>We thank God because that is the greatest miracle of them all.
    <br>He just received grace in his last hour.
    <br>When he left home, he said that when he comes back,
    <br>he is going to preach to the whole of our area - they will receive Jesus Christ.
    <br>He said, "When I come back, all of my friends will be saved".
    <br>During his funeral, many souls got saved.
    <br>We even received grace to buy 50 Bibles to give away to people who received Jesus as their Lord and Saviour.
    <br>So, we feel it is "mission accomplished".
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I just want to confirm what my mother was saying and to say that we are in the presence of the Lord,
    <br>more than we can see with our eyes, more than we can feel with our hands.
    <br>I would like to encourage everyone to carry on praying,
    <br>carry on believing in Christ, for He is our Saviour and the Lord is our God. Amen.

    <br>Just before the building collapsed,

    <br>It was just before one o'clock, South African time.

    <br>I asked her, "Why?".
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>She said, "Since I arrived in Lagos and spoke to God, God told me that he needs me".
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>I asked, "Why is God saying He needs you? You left here to come to Lagos and God said He needs you?
    <br>Why does He need you?".
    <br>She said, "We cannot argue with God.
    <br>Just listen to what I am telling you".
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>"God has been persistently telling me that He needs me. Just tell the children that I am not coming back home".
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>"For us to see each other again, just tell the children hourly, 'Please, be praying''".
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences

    <br>I have seen God's power working since my child went back Home.
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>When the family members came and found me strong, they said I was lying,
    <br>that I sold the child to Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>I said, "There was no one who killed my daughter".
    <br>At that time, my daughter told me where she was going.
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>There is no one who can tell me more truth than what my daughter told me before the building collapsed.
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>I don't want to say this and that; I don't want to say more.
    <br>I am here to give a testimony of what God has been doing since my daughter passed away -
    <br>the goodness of God.
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>I have seen the grace of God since my daughter passed away.

    <br>A word came to the little sister Innocencia from the Martyr.
    <br>"Please, look after Mama and please, be strong and keep on going on".
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>Because for five days, Innocencia was not eating; she was inconsolable.
    <br>She was crying all the time, to a point where blood was coming through her nose.
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>The Martyr said that where she is, she is with God.
    <br>They are rejoicing and singing songs.
    <br>They must stop crying because she is alive; she is not dead.
    <br>They must just look after their mother.
    <br>Relations Of The Martyrs Of Faith And Victims Share Their Experiences
    <br>I thank God for what He did through Prophet TB Joshua,
    <br>for taking those God might have thought would die in sin.
    <br>He took all of them, rescued them and delivered them.

    <br>My sister came to me in a dream and said that we must pray and not cry.
    <br>Thank you.

    <br>we will not be able to go further.
