    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There is a brother there.
    <br>The problem you are having is that you always find yourself bedwetting.
    <br>You don't know how it comes; it just comes like that.
    <br>So, please, come out.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>This is time for your deliverance.
    <br>Now is your salvation.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Because this is destroying your career and your future.
    <br>Your name is Daniel.
    <br>CURSED! Prophecy Reveals Why Man Wears Pampers!!!
    <br>I am Daniel, the one that is bedwetting always.
    <br>I was actually running to the restroom, so I had to run back.
    <br>Because I called you and you did not come out, that is why I am walking towards you
    <br>to bring you out.
    <br>I have been suffering from this bedwetting for the past eight years.
    <br>Actually, this started in India.
    <br>Why did you make me mention your name?
    <br>I am very sorry.
    <br>Just have mercy on me.
    <br>I feel very shy in the presence of my friend.
    <br>I am very sorry.
    <br>Please, have mercy on me.
    <br>- It has destroyed your marriage and career.
    <br>- So many things.
    <br>You can't sleep outside.
    <br>There was a place you went to where you bedwet
    <br>and you said it was a little boy that was the one bedwetting.
    <br>It is true, sir.
    <br>- Because of that you wear short...
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>There are some pads you normally put here when you want to sleep.
    <br>- He is laughing.
    <br>- It is true, sir.
    <br>Go and wait for me.
    <br>CURSED! Prophecy Reveals Why Man Wears Pampers!!!
    <br>I have been bedwetting for the past eight years.
    <br>Without pampers, I found it difficult to sleep at night.
    <br>I normally used pampers each night when I slept.
    <br>Without these pampers, I found it difficult to go anywhere.
    <br>It was up to the extent that I bought perfume.
    <br>Each time, I wanted to go out, I would sprinkle perfume all over my body
    <br>but yet it could not help.
    <br>This is what I had been using for eight consecutive years, mainly at night.
    <br>When I was going out, I normally held them; I took them along with me.

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Momodu Daniel, I am from Edo State.
    <br>Last week during the service, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied that
    <br>there was a young man there whose problem was that he usually bedwet.
    <br>When he said it, I felt very shy and found it difficult to come out.
    <br>He then said that the man's name was Daniel.
    <br>When he said that my name is Daniel, there was a man close to me.
    <br>I told the man that I found it difficult to come out
    <br>because right then, I needed to go to the bathroom.
    <br>I felt very shy to come out because people would look at me.
    <br>That devastating affliction quenched my life for eight consecutive years.
    <br>After that, he said that I should come out, that it was my day for salvation.
    <br>The prophecy was all about me but I found it difficult to come out.
    <br>I needed to go to the bathroom.
    <br>That had caused a lot of things in my life
    <br>and among my fellow business counterparts and business groups.
    <br>It started when I was in India.
    <br>What caused this was that I was involved in internet fraud.
    <br>CURSED! Prophecy Reveals Why Man Wears Pampers!!!
    <br>I went to clubs, womanised and did a lot of things I wasn't supposed to do
    <br>because I was far from God.
    <br>I met a girl.
    <br>She's a Ghanaian but she resided in India.
    <br>I talked to her and told her that I would like her to be my friend, that we should be together.
    <br>The girl told me that there was no problem, that since I was a foreigner,
    <br>she would try everything so that I could be successful.
    <br>So, we started a relationship.
    <br>When the relationship was on, we began making love without condoms.
    <br>Though at that particular time, I was afraid,
    <br>I said that I was a man, so nothing would happen.
    <br>All of a sudden, the girl came to me and said that she was pregnant for me.
    <br>I said, "How can you tell me you are pregnant for me?
    <br>Do you think I am in India to start making people pregnant?
    <br>I am not here for any foreign baby.
    <br>I am here for business.
    <br>I came here for something.
    <br>I don't want anything that will deprive me of my blessing."
    <br>When she came back another time, I gave her an amount of money
    <br>to get rid of the pregnancy because I was not ready for the pregnancy.
    <br>I was with my friends when the girl uttered a curse on me
    <br>that I would bedwet for the rest of my life.
    <br>When the girl uttered that ugly statement, I looked at it to be nothing.
    <br>I felt unconcerned.
    <br>In the second month after that, I started bedwetting.
    <br>Since that started, there was no night I did not bedwet.
    <br>I bedwet every night.
    <br>My friends despised me; a lot of people despised me.
    <br>Because of the bedwetting, I was living in abject poverty.
    <br>When I had a business meeting with my friends,
    <br>because of the smell, nobody wanted to see me.
    <br>If I was coming towards people and they saw me, everyone would run.
    <br>I went to the supermarket to get perfume.
    <br>Each time I went out, I would sprinkle the perfume all over me
    <br>so that people would not experience the bad smell, but it was to no avail.
    <br>That was how I was suffering.
    <br>When it started, without a pad, there was no way I could be able to sleep.
    <br>Every night when I was sleeping, I would normally use a pad.
    <br>Without the pads, I found it difficult.
    <br>Even at that particular time, when I was facing the devastating affliction,
    <br>I hardly wore white; I would wear black.
    <br>I am the kind of person that loves designer wear.
    <br>It was black that I normally wore.
    <br>Since Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me,
    <br>I stopped experiencing it, even till today.
    <br>That was last week.
    <br>I no longer experience it.
    <br>That is the voice of God.
    <br>If the Lord puts His Words into your mouth,
    <br>you shall say that which you shall live to see accomplished.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If the Lord puts His Words in your mouth,
    <br>I shall say that which I will live to see accomplished."
    <br>That is the difference between God's Word and our word.
    <br>We have the ability to say, "Be healed."
    <br>And the Holy Spirit says as He wills.
    <br>Before now, since the time I was affected by that devastating affliction,
    <br>I would lie against a little child.
    <br>Each time I would bedwet, I would say it was the little child that bedwet,
    <br>whereas, it was not the little child.
    <br>It was just because I was shy and ashamed.
    <br>There was no way a big boy like me
    <br>could stand and tell people I was bedwetting at my age.
    <br>Today, you are a free man.
    <br>Today, I am a free man; I am delivered!
    <br>I am a free man; I am delivered!
    <br>Thank you.
