    <br>Prophet TB Joshua ministers prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>and every spiritual entity causing crisis in the lives of the people are exposed.
    <br>As he encountered Mr Victor Smith from Australia,
    <br>the demonic spirit killing, stealing and destroying his life manifests.
    <br>Let's watch what happens next.
    <br>Who are you? Speak out!
    <br>What have you done to him? What have you done to his career?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I will kill him".
    <br>Why do you want to kill him, you demon?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Because he came here".
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Why did he come here?".
    <br>Who are you, you demon?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I am destruction. I killed his family. I am going to kill him".
    <br>And what else? Who did you kill again?
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I'm going to kill him".
    <br>This is my husband, Victor.
    <br>What can you say about your husband?
    <br>He has a bad attitude, he struggles with offence and pain of the past.
    <br>He gets offended and angry easily.
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I will kill him. I destroyed his mind".
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance, in Jesus' name,
    <br>and to God be the glory, the evil spirits tormenting his life were cast out.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>After receiving prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, from Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Mr Victor Smith from Australia also had an encounter with the Holy Spirit
    <br>that uprooted all the poisonous substances that were deposited in his body, during the Mass Prayer.
    <br>Let's watch what happened.
    <br>Holy Spirit - Spirit of deliverance -
    <br>rain on me, Lord.
    <br>Holy Spirit, rain on your children.
    <br>Rain on us Your Spirit of deliverance.
    <br>Holy Ghost, in my blood.
    <br>Holy Ghost, in my bones.
    <br>Holy Ghost, in my kidneys.
    <br>Holy Ghost, in my liver.
    <br>Holy Ghost, in my organs.
    <br>Holy Ghost!
    <br>As Prophet TB Joshua conducted the Mass Prayer,
    <br>the anointing of Jesus Christ fell upon the people
    <br>and every yoke of sickness and disease was broken and flushed out.
    <br>Whatever poisonous substance that was planted in the bodies of the people are uprooted and they are free.
    <br>Among them was Mr Victor Smith.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Victor Smith and the person next to me is my wife, Christel Smith.
    <br>We are from Australia.
    <br>What brought me here was the spirit of smoking and addiction.
    <br>It all started when I was a child.
    <br>I went through an abusive family, a broken home.
    <br>At a very young age I started to get addicted to cigarettes
    <br>and drugs - heavy methamphetamemes, heroin, marijuana.
    <br>The addiction became more serious as I entered my 20's.
    <br>I got married. The drugs overtook my life and destroyed that marriage.
    <br>So, I moved from State to State to start afresh.
    <br>I did not realise that the spirit inside me was overtaking me and making my life worse -
    <br>it was destroying everything that I was touching.
    <br>By that stage I had moved to another end of Australia,
    <br>and after my second child was born and passed away,
    <br>I started to drink heavily and take as many drugs as I could to black out everything.
    <br>By that time I was fully out of control.
    <br>I suffered from mental illness because of the drugs.
    <br>I ended up going in and out of mental health institutions to try to get myself back on track.
    <br>But, being a heavy drug addict, it destroyed not only myself, but the people around me.
    <br>At that moment, I was lost.
    <br>I allowed the evil spirit inside of me to take over my life.
    <br>So, I kept running from State to State trying to find a new beginning.
    <br>But I just could not find it,
    <br>until I met some people that introduced me to cooking or producing the methamphetamemes
    <br>that is destroying the people on the streets nowadays.
    <br>The purity of it was high-grade methamphetamemes.
    <br>To get my fix for the drugs, I had to do a lot of criminal activity like stealing
    <br>to produce the drug that I was selling to the young people on the streets.
    <br>By that time in my life, I was completely out of control.
    <br>I was suicidal; I attempted suicide a few times before I came back to Perth, Australia.
    <br>The drugs I was taking would make me stay awake for weeks.
    <br>I wouldn't eat.
    <br>If I wanted to hurt someone, the drugs would take over and put a rage and an anger in me,
    <br>and I would go to hurt this person.
    <br>If someone owed me money, I would run to where they were and instead of asking, I would take.
    <br>If I wanted to do a 'break and enter' or steal a car, the drugs inside me would take over. I would go and do it.
    <br>If I had to get chemicals to cook or produce the drugs,
    <br>I would break into Chemists or do stupid things to fulfil that urge that was inside me.
    <br>By that stage, the drugs had taken full effect, they had taken control.
    <br>Every time I was on a 'come down' [the drugs wore off] I would get angry, I would hit a rage
    <br>and I would take it out on people that were close to me and that wanted to help me.
    <br>I even took medication that the mental health institutions gave to me to bring me back on a level base.
    <br>Because they had no effect, I would go to a drug dealer's house
    <br>or go to a friend's house and take their drugs to use for myself.
    <br>I was a very addicted person. I was taking more than what normal people usually take.
    <br>I would take such a high dose all at once that it would keep me going for a week, maybe two,
    <br>and I would not eat - it would be like fasting.
    <br>I would starve myself and lose weight.
    <br>I started becoming delusional and hallucinating.
    <br>I didn't function properly. My focus on things was deteriorating.
    <br>And as soon as the drugs started wearing off after a week or longer of being awake, I would power-nap.
    <br>The power-naps would start to affect me - I would fall asleep while I was driving.
    <br>By then, I realised it was time to get another fix to keep myself up and going.
    <br>That is when I became more engaged in cooking or producing drugs with friends
    <br>in order to make money to feed my addiction and other people's on the street.
    <br>The evil spirit inside me was taking over to produce drugs.
    <br>It was destroying my life, as you can see.
    <br>I have given that drug to other people on the street, so the evil spirit inside me has destroyed many other lives too.
    <br>I know that it was not my doing, but it was the devil taking control,
    <br>because he took my life to a new level in order to take other lives.
    <br>I feel bad for what I have done. I am remorseful,
    <br>but people need to realise what the drug is all about.
    <br>It is not good for you and it is found all over the world.
    <br>I produced it and gave it to other people to make money.
    <br>I made a lot of money, but I have nothing to show for it
    <br>because I had to repay people and get myself back on track.
    <br>I had to lose everything to be where I am now.
    <br>With the rage that had built up, if someone looked at me in a wrong way or just spoke to me in a wrong tone,
    <br>I would just get angry.
    <br>And if someone owed me money, I would go to them and beat them to a pulp.
    <br>I would use hockey sticks or whatever I could find.
    <br>I would only stop once I fulfilled the urge of the rage.
    <br>Having no control of the rage that took over was unbearable.
    <br>Because I have hurt people for little things, I have hurt people for major things,
    <br>and I have seriously hurt people for no reason.
    <br>When I look back now, I think, "That was not me; that was something else".
    <br>But the rage that took over from the drug itself is over-bearing. You have no control of what you are doing.
    <br>I met my wife on a dating site.
    <br>On our first date we took a lot of drugs.
    <br>Both of us were heavy users and this was not good because
    <br>the balance was not there and we got angry at each other.
    <br>For example, I got so angry one time that I wanted to beat her up.
    <br>I ended up getting run over by her in her car - there were dents in the bonnet of the car.
    <br>She literally ran over me because of my rage.
    <br>She has taken a handsaw to me because I have gone to hit her.
    <br>So, she has taken a saw to me and hacked at me.
    <br>But for both of us being drug addicts, it was hard because I would not let her have a higher fix than mine.
    <br>I thought that the drugs were what brought us together.
    <br>Later on we realised that it was time to give up the drugs, but it was hard.
    <br>My wife pulled me out of the bottom of my sister's pool when I tried to drown myself again.
    <br>She jumped into the pool, pulled me out and took me to the hospital in time.
    <br>There are too many times to count how many times I have tried to hang myself.
    <br>I tried jumping off a bridge at first.
    <br>I've OD'd [overdosed] several times.
    <br>I've tried to drown myself.
    <br>The major one was the last time that I was on the bottom of the pool.
    <br>My very first suicide attempt was hanging myself from the tree in my own backyard.
    <br>My suicide attempts started after my daughter passed away.
    <br>Because the urge of the drugs weren't doing anything, it was pushing me more into suicide.
    <br>Because I was mentally unstable, I was having personality turns.
    <br>I was hearing voices.
    <br>I started to hallucinate.
    <br>I was hearing screams while I was asleep,
    <br>and I started to tear at my ears because I had no control of what was going on.
    <br>The drugs fully took effect and destroyed pretty much my own sense of mind of what I was doing.
    <br>And because I was too focussed on the money and my next fix, I didn't care about anything else or anyone.
    <br>When I met my wife, she gave me a sense of purpose to continue,
    <br>but I took a lot of rage out on her.
    <br>Our children have seen a lot of anger come out of me.
    <br>I would snap at both my wife and the children for no reason.
    <br>I would blame my wife for everything, whereas it was my own doing.
    <br>I was taking a lot of heroin.
    <br>Believe it or not, heroin is easy to get on the streets and it is a very hard drug. It is a sedative drug.
    <br>It is a drug that you don't want because after your high comes down, you want another high,
    <br>and you will do anything to get that high.
    <br>With the methamphetamemes, the meth is so potent that it takes a hold.
    <br>As soon as you have your first taste of it, you want more and more.
    <br>It is an addiction that overrides your life; it will control every area.
    <br>It is so dangerous that if you have too much you can overdose, overheat your body.
    <br>The ecstasy I was taking was frying my brain to a point where I couldn't speak,
    <br>I couldn't control what I was doing.
    <br>And all of the other drugs that I was taking on top of that were just a fix,
    <br>because I needed something to keep me on a high.
    <br>I tried to give up drugs and I found a church to go to.
    <br>The pastor there mentioned The Synagogue Church Of All Nations and he said to watch Emmanuel TV,
    <br>and pray along with Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>I have watched a few episodes, and I was a sceptic.
    <br>I didn't believe and I thought it was a hoax,
    <br>until I saw an episode of a man who was from America.
    <br>He was trafficking drugs, doing pretty much what I was doing.
    <br>And I saw him being delivered.
    <br>Deep down inside me I wanted this for myself.
    <br>My pastor helped pay for us to be here today.
    <br>When Prophet TB Joshua came towards me I could feel energy come from him.
    <br>But when he came to touch me it felt like someone hit me,
    <br>and something pushed through the back of my body,
    <br>and then after that I passed out. I don't remember anything until Mass Prayer.
    <br>I was asked to go back to my seat.
    <br>During Mass Prayer,
    <br>the evil substance that was inside my stomach and body
    <br>started to come out when Prophet TB Joshua started doing Mass Prayer.
    <br>The changes I have seen are that I am more loving towards my wife,
    <br>I don't have the urge to get angry at people - my patience is well and truly there.
    <br>I am clear-headed, I can think, I can focus more.
    <br>Every time that I read the Word It speaks to me in ways that I have never felt or read before in my life.
    <br>And it has really turned my life around.
    <br>The urge for any substance, any cigarettes or anything, is gone. I have no temptation for it at all.
    <br>I have actually pressed in more to pray to God and to read the Word,
    <br>so I have had no temptation for any substances, drugs or anything.
    <br>I praise God!
    <br>Indeed, this is the power of God that liberated our brother
    <br>and separated him from that spirit that pushed him into such a heavy lifestyle of addiction.
    <br>My advice to the young people out there, even the elderly ones taking this drug, is to go to a church.
    <br>Press in to God. Leave your issues with God.
    <br>Because the drugs will deteriorate and you will fall into a destruction of your life.
    <br>And if you have the chance to come to The SCOAN,
    <br>receive that touch and be released from that demon that is inside of you.
    <br>It is because the addiction is a very serious addiction to something that will destroy your life.
    <br>DEMONS Are REAL Shocking Deliverance & Confession!!!
    <br>My name is Christel Fischer.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my husband, Victor Smith.
    <br>We are from Australia.
    <br>We are here to give glory to God for what He has done in our lives.
    <br>Victor and I met each other three years ago,
    <br>and we were both still heavily addicted to drugs at the time.
    <br>Victor had just been released from a mental institution when we met
    <br>and I was dealing with my own drug addiction and had been hospitalised at the time we met as well.
    <br>We tried very hard to stop the drugs that we were using.
    <br>We knew that we didn't want them in our lives.
    <br>We knew that it was impossible to have a lasting relationship if you were using drugs.
    <br>No matter how hard we tried to stop, it just kept on taking over our lives.
    <br>When we were first together and we were using drugs,
    <br>when the drugs wore off it was quite a hostile and violent environment that we were living in.
    <br>I was not really understanding the evil spirits that I was dealing with in Victor.
    <br>They were actually taking over to the point that it was not Victor at all that I was speaking to anymore.
    <br>They had different names and different characters.
    <br>I was facing situations where he had tried to attack me and I grabbed a handsaw - it was the nearest thing I could grab.
    <br>I attacked him back with that to defend myself.
    <br>When he came to the following day, he could not recollect anything that had happened.
    <br>So to him, I was the one that was attacking him, instead of the other way around.
    <br>There were situations where I had tried to get away from him and he came after me,
    <br>and I ran him down with my car because I was so terrified. I did not know what else to do.
    <br>Because we were on drugs, we were not able to deal with our issues with a rational mind, because we were high.
    <br>When you take the drug itself, it lifts you on such a high like no other.
    <br>But because it lifts you so high, when the drug starts to wear off and you are coming down, you crash really hard.
    <br>You are depressed, you are suicidal, you are angry, everything is irritating you, it makes you paranoid,
    <br>and that is when that rage enters and you start to get angry and accuse each other of things that weren't real situations.
    <br>When that anger would take over him, it was frightening - his eyes were blank.
    <br>I knew that what I was looking at was not a human,
    <br>or what you could describe in the natural - there had to be something demonic.
    <br>For example, there was a time where we were driving from Victor's sister's house to my grandmother's house.
    <br>Victor was driving the vehicle and all of a sudden he said to me, "I am starting to turn".
    <br>So, that is how he would describe it when he felt like they were taking over his body.
    <br>We pulled over the car and I got into the driver's seat.
    <br>By the time he got into the passenger seat, I was not sitting next to Victor.
    <br>This person had a different name.
    <br>They had different characteristics and mannerisms - the way they spoke,
    <br>the way they held themselves was completely different.
    <br>There was another time, I think it was the same day that I pulled Victor out of the swimming pool,
    <br>he had been drinking that day and taking drugs.
    <br>I was driving to pick my children up from school, and we were on a highway where I was driving 100 km an hour.
    <br>Victor and my daughter's boyfriend were starting to attack each other in the car.
    <br>They were trying to jump out of the car while I was driving 100 km per hour.
    <br>It was so frightening.
    <br>I just wanted to get him out of the car because of his rage.
    <br>I drove back to his sister's house and I left him there,
    <br>and I took my daughter and her boyfriend and we went somewhere else.
    <br>By the time I came back, I found Victor asleep in the pool.
    <br>I jumped in and I was trying to pull him out, but physically I couldn't pull him out.
    <br>I hit him with things, trying to keep him awake while I was waiting for the ambulance to arrive.
    <br>When Victor received his touch, he manifested almost instantly.
    <br>I could see even before,
    <br>as Prophet TB Joshua was praying for people to be healed, I could see that Victor was getting agitated.
    <br>He did mention to me that he could feel the presence of God so strongly coming off Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>as he was laying hands on the person next to him.
    <br>When I received a touch myself, I have seen the footage, and it looks like I had only been touched once,
    <br>but it felt like Prophet TB Joshua's hand touched me over and over again.
    <br>Before we came here, I was the one that was always praying and all that, more than Victor.
    <br>But since we've been here, Victor is reading the Bible more, praying the more, he is at the altar more than I am.
    <br>So we just give God all the glory.
    <br>DEMONS Are REAL Shocking Deliverance & Confession!!!
    <br>Amen. So you have seen him showing that renewed desire for God.
    <br>What about the issue of him taking cigarettes, drugs? What can you say about him since the deliverance?
    <br>Since the deliverance, even from the time that we arrived here, there was no desire for the smoking.
    <br>Usually if we were at home and he didn't have cigarettes, he was very grumpy, very agitated.
    <br>But there has been no desire, nothing at all, since we've been here.
    <br>He's been completely set free from smoking.
    <br>And what about your relationship as husband and wife since that deliverance?
    <br>How is everything with your relationship now?
    <br>We are getting along a lot better. Victor is a lot more loving towards me.
    <br>We are spending a lot of time just chatting and things like that, that we wouldn't usually have been doing.
    <br>Before we came, I found that he was very reserved, he was by himself a lot, and would have headphones on.
    <br>And even though we were in the same room together, I felt like I was by myself most of the time.
    <br>Since we have been here, just the chatting thing - we are really enjoying each other's company.
    <br>I would like to advise the viewers all over the world, anyone that is stuck in the bondage of addiction,
    <br>or feels like they need deliverance, or healing or blessing,
    <br>that they should make their way to The SCOAN.
    <br>The presence of God is so tangible here
    <br>and the power of God is evident by the deliverances, blessings and healings that take place.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>And of course our sister is advising that we find a living church
    <br>where the Holy Spirit's power and presence is clearly evident.
    <br>And we thank God that God brought this couple all the way from Australia here to The SCOAN in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Today their lives have become a wonderful testimony
    <br>and a lesson especially to those still in the bondage of addictions.
    <br>We thank God. We pray that God will give you both the grace to continue to stay close to our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Make the Word of God the standard for your lives and we believe that the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Victor Smith and the lady beside me is my wife, Christel Smith.
    <br>Jesus has set me free from my past and has given me a future to look forward to.
    <br>He has done wonders.
    <br>He brought me and my wife closer together
    <br>and took away my past life of addictions, anger and rage.
    <br>Now I can move forward into a new beginning in life.
    <br>I have started pressing into the Word and reading the Word more.
    <br>I've got a clearer mind - of thinking - and can focus more on the Word,
    <br>my relationship with my wife and my future with God.
    <br>I'm going to keep pressing into what I need to do with my life now.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Just briefly tell us, brother. The many years of drug addiction and substance abuse,
    <br>how did this actually affect your life, especially from the financial perspective?
    <br>It put me financially in a pit a few years back, but now I'm slowly getting back on my feet.
    <br>God gave me a job after seven years of drug addiction.
    <br>I lost everything to it - family, friends, finances, my house.
    <br>We see what satan has stolen from you through this demon of addiction,
    <br>but by the grace of God, Jesus has delivered you and restored you back.
    <br>And we thank God that you are here today as a living testimony to Jesus Christ.
    <br>My name is Christel Smith and the man standing beside me is Victor Smith, my husband.
    <br>Jesus Christ has definitely put an end to our past and given birth to a new beginning for us.
    <br>Since we have come here, it's just amazing to see my husband praying more, and reading the Bible more.
    <br>I couldn't ask for more than that.
    <br>All my prayers have definitely been answered that I had been praying prior to this.
    <br>There are no more addictions. We are completely set free and delivered from our past,
    <br>and we just thank Jesus for that.
    <br>Hallelujah. Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>And we also want to ask you how your past life - both for you and your husband -
    <br>how this addiction really affected you financially?
    <br>Financially, because of our addictions, we really lost everything.
    <br>And even though Victor has started working now, we are still paying off a lot of the debts we had accumulated
    <br>while living the life that we did.
    <br>Even our pastors from our church back home were the ones that financially supported us to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty that Jesus has intervened and delivered you both.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has done for this family
    <br>and we have a message for both of you from Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>The man of God said that he really wants to support you both as you are going back to Australia
    <br>to start your new life, to enjoy the new found freedom you have through the deliverance here at The SCOAN.
    <br>And we have heard from you how financially these addictions really took their toll.
    <br>And apart from you receiving spiritual deliverance here at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua and The Emmanuel TV Partners also want to support you financially.
    <br>So on behalf of Prophet TB Joshua, we are here to present to you this cash gift of $3,000 USD, from the man of God.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus. Thank you, Emmanuel TV.
    <br>And in addition to that, we are also of course giving you the Word of God,
    <br>'The Mirror', as a reminder that whatever you received here is to make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>Thank You Jesus, and thank You Jesus for bringing Prophet TB Joshua into the world for us!
    <br>Thank you, Emmanuel TV, for blessing me and my wife for a new beginning in life!
    <br>Thank you very much! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>I wasn't expecting anything like this to happen.
    <br>I was expecting the salvation of my soul and nothing more from Emmanuel TV or Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>Thank you! God bless you, Prophet TB Joshua and Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Thank you very much!
    <br>Wow, this is huge.
    <br>I really want to thank Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>I want to thank God Almighty and Emmanuel TV and Emmanuel TV Partners.
