  <p>    
    <br>Tomorrow is mystery.
    <br>Satan believes he can hit us; he can cause us pain.
    <br>That pain will drag us away from Jesus, whereas that pain strengthens our desire the more.
    <br>But if you are not a real Christian, pain cannot strengthen your desire.
    <br>You can know whether you're a real Christian or just a Christian by mouth.
    <br>You see people say, "I'm a Christian". You too are a Christian.
    <br>But you are a real Christian by heart.
    <br>If you are a real Christian, situations strengthen your desire and determination for God.
    <br>This is how we know we are Christians.
    <br>Many people keep asking me, "T.B. Joshua, how do we know we are Christians?"
    <br>You know you are a Christian when your situation strengthens your desire and determination for God.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "You know you are a Christian
    <br>when your situation strengthens your desire and determination for Jesus".
    <br>That is when you will say, "Ah, this situation is too much because I'm not a Christian.
    <br>Why this failure?"
    <br>No, we don't measure our Christian lives by the situations or trials we are going through.
    <br>You know you are a Christian when your situations, trials, temptations become the object
    <br>of strengthening your desire and determination for God.
    <br>"Ah, you are a Christian!"
    <br>It becomes an object that strengthens your desire.
    <br>Let me give you a good example.
    <br>When you are thirsty, there would be a strong urge for water.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When you are thirsty, there will be what?
    <br>A strong urge for what? - For water. You want to drink.
    <br>So also, situations cause us urge for who?
    <br>For God.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "Situations cause our urge for who?"
    <br>[For God.]
    <br>Then, you are a Christian.
    <br>You pray once in the morning, but because of a situation you have,
    <br>you started praying three times.
    <br>After a little time, "In Jesus' name" because you believe He is the only who can rescue you.
    <br>You have no other way. Situations cannot determine your position before God.
    <br>When I say situation, it could be temptation, sickness, hardship, failure.
    <br>When you are thirsty now, you cannot sit down.
    <br>You will be, "Ah, I need water. I need water".  When you now see water, you will be like...
    <br>The way you grab it, you want to drink it.
    <br>So also, when a situation comes, you run to Jesus!
    <br>What is the position of satan now?
    <br>He is a foolish man because he is the cause of that situation.
    <br>I never knew that the situation is the urge that we have for Jesus.
    <br>So when that situation now becomes an object of urge,
    <br>the reason why you run to Jesus and satan is the cause of it, he is useless to you.
    <br>He has no bearing.
    <br>But rather, the opposite is the case today.
    <br>When situations come, you begin to lament.
    <br>When that one inside you causes you to lament, to cry,
    <br>instead of causing you to run to Him and fast more, pray the more,
    <br>you now begin to lament, "Why this one?
    <br>I go to church always. I don't know why all this. I pray, I fast.
    <br>I have not been smoking like before and I have not even been following my friends to party.
    <br>I have not been going to nightclubs again.
    <br>Why all this?
    <br>Even when I was going to nightclubs, I never faced all these crises. Why this crisis?"
    <br>You'll  know you're not a Christian.
    <br>You are just a Christian by mouth.
    <br>So I hope you can know whether you are a Christian now.
    <br>You can know now.
    <br>You know when your situation causes you urge to run to Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If anyone or anybody is telling you that because you are a Christian,
    <br>no situations - ah!
    <br>If no situation because you are a Christian, how do you grow in your Christian life?
    <br>Ask your neighbor, "How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?"
    <br>Ask your neighbor.
    <br>[How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?]
    <br>Ask your neighbor.
    <br>[How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?]
    <br>Again.
    <br>[How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?]
    <br>Write it down.
    <br>Because those little things, they are things that are disturbing your life.
    <br>They are things that disturb your relationship with God.
    <br>You are lost already because of situations.
    <br>How will you grow in your Christian life when there is no situation?
    <br>You cannot grow in your Christian life if only joy, joy, food, food,
    <br>progress, progress, breakthrough, breakthrough.
    <br>Breakthrough causes us to relax.
    <br>When there is breakthrough, that cannot cause you to pray the more.
    <br>Rather, you dress well; you have time to comb your hair.
    <br>Sitting down, even when you want to come to Jesus. No!
    <br>How will you grow in your Christian life when there's no situation?
    <br>Like I have said, situations could be barrenness, sickness, poverty, hardship,
    <br>setback, temptation of any form.
    <br>And these are the things you are now facing.
    <br>These are the things that cause you to abandon your post.
    <br>Instead of these things to draw you close to God, they are now taking you away from God.
    <br>Ok, look at T.B. Joshua today.
    <br>You know me. You've read so much about me.
    <br>If there is any man of God in the world, because of persecution,
    <br>you know more about T.B. Joshua than any other man or God
    <br>because you are interested in T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Five years ago, they were giving me four years.
    <br>"See whether he will spend four years." - You have been monitoring when he will go.
    <br>Many of us rebuked, fasted and prayed in the past that this church would collapse - ignorantly.
    <br>But you realised that that prayer refused to answer.
    <br>You are now showing interest, "I will see".
    <br>"Ah, this man! We prayed that he should fall but instead of falling, it´s growing.
    <br>What is the cause of all this, my God?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So this is why the Bible says that we should not destroy relationships beyond what?
    <br>- Beyond repair.
    <br>If you have a relationship, relationship is fundamental; it's of God.
    <br>When there's trouble, be careful.
    <br>Even when you husband and wife want to divorce, that should not end the relationship.
    <br>Don't destroy it beyond repair.
    <br>If you destroy it beyond repair, the person you are fighting may be a savior tomorrow for you.
    <br>How will you meet the person?
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: TOMORROW IS MYSTERY
    <br>The person you are fighting, he has done so much against you - so bad.
    <br>Whether husband and wife, you want to divorce. Okay.
    <br>After the divorce, you continue praying for that man and the man should continue praying for you.
    <br>He can give you a call at any time, "Hello. How are you?
    <br>I just want to know how you are doing".
    <br>Because that relationship has been there.
    <br>"Oh, thank you!"
    <br>"Happy New Year!" -  You may be the first person he will give a call to.
    <br>" I just want to greet you."
    <br>Let it remain like that because he or she may be your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>"No! Over my dead body. We meet in Heaven."
    <br>Who told you you will go to Heaven?
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Don't destroy a relationship beyond what?
    <br>[Repair.]
    <br>No matter what happens.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "Don't destroy a relationship beyond repair".
    <br>Yes, satan is our accuser.
    <br>And satan is a spirit being.
    <br>We are not fighting flesh and blood.
    <br>I cannot stand here and begin to abuse the flesh, abuse a person,
    <br>abuse the name, call them names, no.
    <br>The Bible says we are fighting spirit being, not flesh and blood.
    <br>And satan is a type of foolish man that can enter one today,
    <br>use the person badly and leave the person.
    <br>And the person you see as a satan yesterday becomes a savior tomorrow.
    <br>How will you handle the situation if you have destroyed the person?
    <br>This is what we are seeing here - deliverance - people that have done a lot being delivered.
    <br>Now being delivered, he is becoming a child of God.
    <br>If the person had been destroyed,
    <br>the opportunity to become a child of God would not be there again.
    <br>One thing I know you are lacking is the spirit of forgiveness;
    <br>you may have it but not genuinely.
    <br>If you have that genuine spirit of forgiveness, you should also forget.
    <br>You forgive but you refuse to forget.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service.
    <br>You do forgive but you fail to forget.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service.
    <br>As if what they have done to you, you have not done it to someone in the past.
    <br>That´s how you judge yourself.
    <br>What they are doing to you, ask yourself,
    <br>"Are you saying, you have not done that to someone in the past?"
    <br>This is the judgment Jesus gave to this woman
    <br>when she was accused and they were about to stone her to death by the law of Moses.
    <br>Fortunately, they run to Jesus and asked Him,
    <br>"How will you judge this woman?
    <br>The law says, anyone who commits adultery should be stoned to death.
    <br>Here is the woman now and it is written by our law".
    <br>They were looking for something to accuse Jesus Himself, not even the woman alone.
    <br>They wanted to bring Jesus into that accusation
    <br>so they were looking for something to get Him, as a set-up.
    <br>And Jesus said, "Well, it is written in your law
    <br>that anyone that committed adultery should be stoned to death".
    <br>He now went on his knees and wrote on the ground.
    <br>When he wrote on the ground, He looked at it and looked at them,
    <br>"Look, what I'm seeing here is,
    <br>if anyone of you has never committed what this woman has committed,
    <br>such person should stone that woman to death".
    <br>They looked at themselves, "It's true. What this woman has committed, I have committed it in the past.
    <br>Oh! I've committed it in the past". Immediately they dropped their stones and took to their heels.
    <br>And Jesus said, "Where are these people that accused you?"
    <br>They could not be found.
    <br>And Jesus said, "I have nothing against you. Go and sin no more".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So that is the reason why you have to forgive.
    <br>Everything they have accused you of, so bitter.
    <br>If you look back, far, you will know that you have also committed it in the past.
    <br>Who are you to judge?
    <br>Finally, take this word.
    <br>When you are at home, sitting down, before you start praying,
    <br>there are many things you need to do.
    <br>Think about your antecedent, where you are coming from, your past record.
    <br>You may not be able to remember when you were little,
    <br>but the little you can remember, just bring it to your present.
    <br>When you bring all this to your present, you will know that enemies cannot kill you.
    <br>It is your fear of enemies that kills you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>They cannot kill you; it's your fear.
    <br>When they attack you and fear comes to you, that fear develops hypertension,
    <br>heart attack, depression and these things become sickness, leading to death.
    <br>Attacks on your business cannot destroy your business.
    <br>It is the fear of that attack that destroys your business.
    <br>Attacks on your health cannot kill you.
    <br>If they give you poison, it cannot kill you but the fear of that.
    <br>When you begin to remember people they have given poison to or when you meet your doctor
    <br>and the doctor says, "Oh no! Go and write your will", that is fear.
    <br>You are dead already.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is nothing you have gone through that someone has not gone through in the past.
    <br>There is nothing you are facing that someone has not faced in the past
    <br>and you know what became of them.
    <br>But what is your problem?
    <br>Why are you easily forgetting the history?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Bible is our standard.
    <br>Take your Bible and read; you will have your role model.
    <br>If you cannot get any role model in this earth,
    <br>by the time you read your Bible, you will find your role model in your Bible.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Time is too short.
    <br>We have wasted our time on this, our marriage, our education, relationships.
    <br>We keep wasting our time, coming back to where we started.
    <br>You go this way.
    <br>You come back again to where you started.
    <br>You go that way.
    <br>You come back again to where you started.
    <br>That is your life. I'm just telling you your life.
    <br>"Some day, when I go to America, I will be great after I have spent 20 years there."
    <br>After getting to America, after 30 years, you will go back to where you started.
    <br>"If I had a billion dollars, I would start a business and become great."
    <br>You get the billion dollars and at the end of the day, again back to where you started.
    <br>There is nothing you have not tried.
    <br>If there is anything you have not tried, it is Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "If there is anything I have not tried, it is Jesus!"
    <br>Because your following Jesus is your own way of following.
    <br>You have not followed Jesus genuinely.
    <br>You have to say the truth. You have not.
    <br>You are hearing from me now that your situation is meant to strengthen your desire, your determination
    <br>and this is the first time you are hearing this kind of thing.
    <br>And if you have heard it in the past, you have not been putting it into practice.
    <br>When trouble comes, you are crying. Is that someone who is following Jesus?
    <br>How do we test your faith? You say you are a Christian.
    <br>So if you are a Christian now, they should not test your faith?
    <br>Anything that is not tested is not genuine.
    <br>Tell your neighbor.
    <br>[Anything that is not tested is not genuine.]
    <br>Because you want to start as fake.
    <br>Why are you afraid of tests?
    <br>Sickness tests you - you are complaining. How do we know you are genuine?
    <br>Failure tests you - you complain. How do we know you are genuine?
    <br>Temptation comes - you complain.  How do we know you are genuine?
    <br>Tribulation comes - you complain. How do we know you are genuine?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "Anything that is not tested is not genuine".
    <br>You know the temptation Jesus went through.
    <br>A lot of tests.
    <br>So when sickness comes, it is a test to know whether you are genuine.
    <br>But you keep complaining, "Now I serve Jesus. I know Jesus.
    <br>Why is all this happening to me? Why this setback? I don´t know. I'm tired".
    <br>Because of that, you don´t pray again.
    <br>After a while you continue praying but you have already revoked,
    <br>you have complained.
    <br>When those things come, it is to remind you, "This is to test my genuineness,
    <br>whether I am truly a child of God, for Jesus or fake".
    <br>It's a test. Anything that is not tested is not genuine.
    <br>Don't cry, murmur, lament when tests come in any form.
    <br>You allow tests to separate your marriage.
    <br>You allow tests to destroy your business.
    <br>You allow tests to destroy your health.
    <br>You allow tests to destroy your life.
    <br>A lot of marriages today that are supposed to be together -
    <br>the troubles that were not supposed to separate them but little trouble - divorce.
    <br>Temptation comes - divorce. Sickness comes - divorce.
    <br>Hardship comes - divorce.
    <br>The same thing, business partner.
    <br>A lot of businesses have been scattered because of this temptation.
    <br>Church - you stop coming to church because of trouble you are going through.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The area I know all of us have wronged is the way we handle relationships.
    <br>Everybody has wronged there.
    <br>Everybody is wrong when it comes to that relationship issue
    <br>because we have destroyed relationships beyond repair.
    <br>No matter what anybody might have done to you, be careful.
    <br>Make sure you have not destroyed your relationship with the person
    <br>to the extent that in the future, you cannot go to him or her.
    <br>Beyond repair is bad.
    <br>God always uses people we have fought with, have issue with and see as enemies
    <br>to be our savior in the future.
    <br>This is what is happening all over the world today.
    <br>You just go to many companies. You want business or you need help.
    <br>By the time you walk inside the company, you'll find that, "Ha!",
    <br>you want to walk back with your back.
    <br>"No problem, I will come back."
    <br>What happened? Somebody that used to be your driver in the past,
    <br>has now become the MD of the big company.
    <br>You have done so bad to him.
    <br>You now turn back and say, "Ah, I will come back. Oga, I will come back".
    <br>You will now begin to ask yourself, "Maybe I have gone to the wrong office".
    <br>It was not the wrong office. That was the office you needed to go to.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tomorrow is mystery.
    <br>Thank you. Viewers, thank you.
