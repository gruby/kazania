    <br>Please, man of God, help me!
    <br>Without this injection, I cannot walk.
    <br>I am tired of tablets and injections.
    <br>Please, help me, man of God!
    <br>Please, I have had operations nine times; next month will be the tenth time.
    <br>Please, I am tired.
    <br>This is what is in my leg.
    <br>Please, man of God, help me!
    <br>After a few years, they will take it out; they have to fix it in the other leg.
    <br>Please, man of God, help me!
    <br>This is what is in my leg.
    <br>This is the injection I take before I can walk.
    <br>These are the tablets I am taking every day.
    <br>I have had operations nine times.
    <br>Man of God, help me, please!
    <br>Next month, I am booked for an operation.
    <br>Please, help me!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua offers spirit-filled prayer.

    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Mrs Joy Gersak is delivered and healed.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Right now, the very lady in question is here in our midst to share her wonderful testimony.
    <br>We can already see the transformation; it is so clear.
    <br>We want to hear from her right now, to the glory of God.
    <br>Madam, you are very welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you please introduce yourself to us and the lady beside you?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God Is With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Joy Gersak.
    <br>I am from Austria.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>Everybody should help me to thank God for bringing me back to life.
    <br>I was really suffering.
    <br>I was passing through pain from one operation to another.
    <br>Every day – tablets, doctors and from one doctor to another.
    <br>They said that it was sports – because of sports was why I had the pain.
    <br>I woke up one day and saw my leg was swollen.
    <br>They had to rush me to hospital.
    <br>On getting there, they said it was this and that.
    <br>They didn't really know what was happening to me.
    <br>They were saying that it was knee arthritis or pus.
    <br>I went from one doctor to another.
    <br>I took more than 13 tablets every day.
    <br>I was confused until the last operation, the ninth operation.
    <br>The ninth one is where they fixed in iron; everybody can still see it.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>This is the tenth one; they said they wanted to fix in more iron.
    <br>This is where they were draining water from.
    <br>It was my sister from Canada; God bless her.
    <br>She is the one who paid for my ticket to come to this place.
    <br>When I arrived here...
    <br>OK, before you go ahead madam...
    <br>We can see our sister is so overwhelmed by the wonderful testimony she has to share.
    <br>We just want you to explain clearly; for how long were you having this bilateral knee arthritis?
    <br>Explain to us; you've mentioned injections, tablets...
    <br>On a daily basis, what was the type of pain you were in because of this problem?
    <br>The pain was unbearable.
    <br>I cannot even remember and I don’t want to remember.
    <br>I cannot.
    <br>I could not eat or sleep.
    <br>I had to take tablets before I went to bed.
    <br>Before I would get out of bed, I would take tablets.
    <br>What were the things you were completely unable to do because of all of this?
    <br>I could not walk; I stopped working.
    <br>I could not do anything my mates were doing.
    <br>Not really.
    <br>Sometimes even to go to the toilet...
    <br>This is my senior daughter.
    <br>With the junior ones, she had to take me to the toilet and take me back.
    <br>Imagine!
    <br>I was really passing through pain.
    <br>You said you had passed through how many operations before you came here?
    <br>Nine operations.
    <br>Nine operations; to the extent that even metal was inserted into one of your knees?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They had told you that they wanted to insert metal in your other knee, before you came here?
    <br>Yes, and they said that I didn’t have the right to decide.
    <br>They had to decide for me.
    <br>So, they decided and fixed the date on November 6th for me to submit all the results for my blood and everything.
    <br>I came here on the 3rd of November.
    <br>How did you find out about The SCOAN?
    <br>You were at the very critical stage now, they wanted to operate your other knee and insert iron...
    <br>How did you come to be here?
    <br>It was a friend; she is more than a sister to me and is based in Canada.
    <br>She is the one who sponsored my coming to this place.
    <br>We thank God Almighty.
    <br>When you came here...
    <br>We witnessed on the screen the events that happened when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.
    <br>Can you just describe to us exactly what happened, as the man of God began to pray?
    <br>As the man of God was praying for me, I passed out.
    <br>I cannot remember what was going on.
    <br>The only thing I heard was, "Get up and walk" and I started running.
    <br>That was the only thing I remember.
    <br>Well, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>When the man of God was praying, speaking in tongues, and your whole body was shaking and trembling;
    <br>you can't remember what happened?
    <br>Not at all.
    <br>The moment you heard the declaration, "Rise up and walk!", what happened?
    <br>I was free and was no longer feeling any pain.
    <br>I slept like a baby – no tablets and no injections.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>There is a big change, very big.
    <br>Before, I could not walk or do what my mates were doing.
    <br>But after I returned, everything was OK.
    <br>I can do everything.
    <br>I also started working.
    <br>I work now, whereas before, I could not work.
    <br>I was on pension as a retiree.
    <br>When I went back to Austria, I went back to the doctor.
    <br>The doctor checked everything and said I was OK; so, I started working.
    <br>Now, I work.
    <br>Well, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You had mentioned madam that the doctors had earlier booked you for an operation.
    <br>When you went back to your country - Austria, what happened?
    <br>When I went back to Austria, I went to meet my doctor and told him I wanted to have an x-ray done, which I did.
    <br>When the doctor checked, he asked me what I had done with my leg.
    <br>I said, "This is God" and he said, "God? What is God?"
    <br>I told him that I had travelled to Nigeria to a church for prayer.
    <br>He said there was no God but I said, "There is God".
    <br>He said he could not find anything in my leg to operate on so they could not operate on it.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>This is the hospital which had told our sister that they would have to insert iron in her other knee
    <br>because of the severity of the arthritis she was in, but the same hospital checked an x-ray and confirmed
    <br>there was no more problem.
    <br>She didn't have to go for an operation.
    <br>I have not been taking tablets, injections, therapy or seeing doctors.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>For the glory of God; we just like you to demonstrate how you can now walk freely,
    <br>after the prayer you received.
    <br>Wow, this is someone that had to take injections just to be able to move about in a slow way.
    <br>We can see what she is doing right now.
    <br>How are you feeling, madam?
    <br>I'm feeling very OK now; I think I may still go back to sports!
    <br>Wow, thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let's put our hands together one more time for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Madam, we can see medical reports on the board here, as well as an x-ray.
    <br>OK, this is a medical report, where the doctor says that everything is fine with my leg.
    <br>I do not need any operation.
    <br>It is written here in German.
    <br>We thank Jesus Christ.
    <br>The medical report is actually written in German language, but our sister is explaining that doctors
    <br>had confirmed that she no longer needed to go for an operation on her other knee, as she had been
    <br>completely healed, to the glory of God Almighty.
    <br>We can also see once again the x-ray here.
    <br>Can you just show this to us, madam?
    <br>This is the x-ray for me left knee before.
    <br>This is the x-ray of my right knee, where they wanted to operate.
    <br>Now, everything is OK.
    <br>This is from where they were removing water before.
    <br>Since then, they have stopped draining water.
    <br>Before, they would drain water three times a week.
    <br>I don't have pain anymore.
    <br>This is indeed a mighty miracle and we give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ;
    <br>one more time, people of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus for rescuing our sister
    <br>and completely setting her free - we thank our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Madam, now, that you are here today, you are living, walking, talking miracle to the testimony
    <br>of our Lord Jesus Christ;
    <br>what is your advice to viewers around the world?
    <br>My advice to everyone who is watching me now is that
    <br>when you have problems, please, don't lose hope; run to God.
    <br>I went to many places and spent money but I came here and the man of God did not take anything from me.
    <br>As I was going back, I know what he gave me.
    <br>He gave me many things, including Morning Water.
    <br>Everybody should help me thank the man of God.
    <br>My advice is that if you have problems, run to God.
    <br>This is where I found my peace.
    <br>This is where I will be coming always, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>My name is Deborah.
    <br>This is my mother.
    <br>Before she came to the church, she was having so much pain.
    <br>My sister and I had to do the dishes; clean the house, do the laundry and help her through the day.
    <br>We were sad because we knew that she was in so much pain and we couldn't really help her.
    <br>It was just to do the dishes, laundry and housework, nothing else.
    <br>We couldn't take the pain away from her.
    <br>Your mother came to The SCOAN.
    <br>What were the changes, the transformation that you saw when she came back to Austria?
    <br>We saw that she could do the things that she couldn't do before.
    <br>She can walk long distances and do the shopping.
    <br>My sister and I can concentrate more on our studies and go out more often.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>My advice would be: everyone should believe; don't lose faith in God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for this wonderful miracle.
    <br>We pray that God would give both our sisters here the grace to continue maintaining
    <br>the wonderful thing they've received from Him and to make the Word of God a standard for their lives
    <br>and as they do so, we know, better is not good enough - the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
