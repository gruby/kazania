    <br>Viewers, it may be your walking with the Lord, that is questionable.
    <br>You may even not know but all you know, you are not happy,
    <br>and people see that you have this - you have money, children, wife
    <br>and your marriage is fine and good.
    <br>You have a good marriage, house and everything is good but yet, you are not happy.
    <br>Only you know that you are not happy.
    <br>Out there, they want you to be their role model, yet you - mentor - are not happy.
    <br>Only you know that you are not happy.
    <br>Whatever that is required to make you happy - be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your job - be restored!
    <br>Your health - be restored!
    <br>Your marriage - be restored!
    <br>Your business - be restored!
    <br>Your finances - be restored!
    <br>Touch The Screen By Faith And Receive
    <br>Your walking with the Lord - be restored!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray!
