    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where will I start the greeting?
    <br>From you?
    <br>Good Morning, sir.
    <br>What of this direction - viewers over there?
    <br>Good Morning, sir, mum, everyone.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We talk about a visit with God.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of John 3.
    <br>"Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus
    <br>who was a member of the Jewish ruling council.
    <br>He came to Jesus at night and said, 'Rabbi, ..."
    <br>That is the traditional way of greeting, like you say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>"... we know that you are a teacher who has come from God.
    <br>For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him'."
    <br>If faith must grow, it must start little.
    <br>If one's faith must grow, it must start little.
    <br>Anytime you see someone shouting, "God is there. I will die there - this is where I will die" -
    <br>very soon you will hear another confession.
    <br>You just say, "Don't die there. If your faith must grow, it must start little."
    <br>You were once an embryo in your mother's womb; today, look at what you are.
    <br>If something starts big, it calls for concern.
    <br>Even your business, you start big - you have to start running.
    <br>Fast and pray because everything demands for time and preparation.
    <br>Everything good and wonderful demands for time and preparation.
    <br>This is why Jesus was not bothered about Nicodemus, when he came to Him in the night,
    <br>"Allow him to come".
    <br>If one's faith must grow, it must start little.
    <br>He was not bothered.
    <br>Let's go to the proof text - verse 15:
    <br>"that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him."
    <br>Can anyone have eternal life in you?
    <br>Eternal life
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>Do you listen to that?
    <br>You want to live eternal life?
    <br>Can anyone live in you when you too, are running for refuge?
    <br>No.
    <br>In Him - in God.
    <br>Everyone comes to say, "Jesus is my Lord"; how many actually believe in their heart?
    <br>You say Jesus is your Lord; how many of you believe in their heart?
    <br>If you believe Jesus in your heart, if what you confess is what you believe in your heart,
    <br>your life would not be like this.
    <br>You would not experience what you are experiencing.
    <br>You never pray for sickness; here is sickness.
    <br>You never pray for poverty; here is poverty.
    <br>This shows that different things you confess and different things you believe.
    <br>You heart and your mouth are not in accord in your confession.
    <br>If what you say is what you believe genuinely, the sky would be your limit.
    <br>The problem of believing is made easy if we know that it is acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The problem of believing is made easy, simple if you know that it is acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>Believing demands action, creates action.
    <br>The Spirit makes us know that believing is possessing.
    <br>The instant you believe, you have; it is yours instantly.
    <br>You say you believe Jesus is Lord!
    <br>Instantly you believe, it is yours - you have it.
    <br>The Spirit of God makes us know that believing is possessing.
    <br>With the heart, man believes that Jesus is Righteousness.
    <br>Jesus is Saviour, Jesus is Healer, Jesus is Deliverer.
    <br>With the heart, not the mouth.
    <br>I meet a lot of people expressing the desire to be Spirit-filled.
    <br>When you meet this one, "Anoint me", this one, "Give me power. Where is power? Give me this..." - everyone.
    <br>I applaud that but you must know that you must be grounded in the Word of God
    <br>before you are Spirit-filled.
    <br>You must be grounded in the Word of God before you are Spirit-filled,
    <br>else there will be nothing there in your heart for the Spirit to remind you of.
    <br>If your heart is empty and you are Spirit-filled, there will be nothing for the Spirit to act on.
    <br>Our spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>The more you think about what you read, the more your spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>Let someone say, "Word to heart".
    <br>When I say heart, I mean your spirit; your spirit means heart.
    <br>Word to heart.
    <br>The more your spirit acts upon the Word, the more you become part of the Word.
    <br>When you become part of the Word, by nature, it changes you.
    <br>You can know Christians; you can know who is not a Christian.
    <br>When I meet a man approaching me in emotional havoc and disturbance,
    <br>I know the Word of God is not dominating his life.
    <br>"Man of God, help me!" - this one I know is empty.
    <br>Living in the Word of God in times of trial and temptation
    <br>will assist us to respond by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>We talk about our battle instead of the One who is fighting for us.
    <br>"I have headache, stomach pain, this, that..."
    <br>We often talk about our battle, trouble, instead of the One fighting for us.
    <br>We respond to reason instead of the Word of God.
    <br>If there is anything we have faith in today, it is in man,
    <br>what man has done - science, works, organisation.
    <br>Acting on the Word of God then gives God an opportunity to look,
    <br>"Oh, what do you want me to do for you?"
    <br>This is why the Spirit of God inspired us;
    <br>one of the greatest faith tools you have is this.
    <br>One of the greatest faith tools you have is the Faith Bracelet.
    <br>Cherish it.
    <br>Meditate in the Word -
    <br>it's a visit with God.
    <br>Today, people talk about their doubt instead of their faith.
    <br>People focus on their enemy instead of their Comforter.
    <br>Here is Faith Bracelet.
    <br>The Word of God takes the place of the unseen Christ.
    <br>Why is so much disappointment when you know the Word of God?
    <br>Because the way you are obeying is not the one the Holy Spirit has spoken of.
    <br>When you obey the Word the Holy Spirit has spoken, it will be well with you.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit that gives Word.
    <br>If you have the Word of God and it is not the Holy Spirit that gave it to you,
    <br>it is of yourself, not of God.
    <br>You pray and fast, "Jesus"
    <br>but the way you are speaking is not of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When you obey the Word that is spoken by the Holy Spirit in times of conflict and suffering,
    <br>you will grow and mature.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"If you obey the Word that is spoken by the Holy Spirit in times of suffering and conflict,
    <br>you will grow and mature."
    <br>Suffering and conflict are the soil in which you grow.
    <br>The SECRET Behind Meeting God | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>When you obey the Word that is spoken by the Holy Spirit in times of trouble and tribulation,
    <br>you will see yourself grow and mature
    <br>because trial is the soil in which faith flourishes.
    <br>That shows, the word you are obeying is not the one that is given by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You hear, "Go!" - you go.
    <br>Who asked you to go?
    <br>It depends on who asked you to go.
    <br>"Jump!" - you obey this word - good.
    <br>Who gave you the word "Go! Jump!"?
    <br>You must read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>You may understand what you are reading but the Holy Spirit must carry you along,
    <br>no matter the understanding.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is our Comforter, Defender, Redeemer.
    <br>You must obey the Word that is spoken by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When you obey the Word that is spoken by the Holy Spirit in times of tribulation,
    <br>you will grow and mature.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Listen!
    <br>The Holy Spirit has a mind.
    <br>Man has the ability to decide.
    <br>You can decide, "I'm going this way..."
    <br>The Holy Spirit has the power of choice.
    <br>This is why God gives us discretion.
    <br>At the Pool of Bethesda, when Jesus met this man,
    <br>He asked him, "What do you want Me to do for you? Do you want Me to help you?"
    <br>He needed to ask.
    <br>The man could have said, "Yes," or "No, I don't need Your help; go".
    <br>Jesus would have said, "Thank you" and would leave.
    <br>Discretion.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Man has the ability to decide.
    <br>As I'm talking now, you can just stand up and go home.
    <br>The Spirit of God will not force you, "No, wait".
    <br>You can choose, "No, I'm going home" and you go.
    <br>The Holy Spirit has the power of choice.
    <br>This teaching and preaching and counselling -
    <br>man has the ability to teach the Bible, to preach and to pray.
    <br>Man has the ability on his own.
    <br>He can choose to stand and begin to say, "In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>or he can come to the altar and begin to say, "Praise the Lord" and preach the swiftest message,
    <br>that everybody will shout, "What a wonderful message!"
    <br>Man has that ability but the Holy Spirit teaches, prays and preaches as He wills.
    <br>The question now is:
    <br>You pray - by what authority?
    <br>You preach - by what authority?
    <br>You do this and that - by what authority?
    <br>Everything we Christians do demands for corresponding power.
    <br>When you want to sit down, it demands for the power from above to sit down
    <br>and at the same time you can choose to sit down on you own.
    <br>As you are sitting now, if you want to stand up,
    <br>as a Christian, you need power from above to stand up.
    <br>At the same time you can choose to stand up on you own.
    <br>This is why the Bible says, the One from above is above all.
    <br>You need power from above to look and at the same time, you can choose to look on your own.
    <br>To pray, you need grace from above and you can choose to pray on your own,
    <br>without corresponding power.
    <br>To dress up - everything about you...
    <br>This is why I said, the life I live is not mine.
    <br>From what?
    <br>You say, "I'm moving, I'm going".
    <br>I can choose to be going up and down,
    <br>but as a Christian, pastor, prophet of God,
    <br>I need grace from above to go up and down,
    <br>corresponding power to move around.
    <br>And I can choose to do that on my own, but I need corresponding power to move around.
    <br>Can you see the life we live?
    <br>We call it "corresponding grace".
    <br>When you ask, "I want to pray" and you cannot hear, you will have to tarry.
    <br>To tarry does not mean you would not do it, but wait.
    <br>Today, when you say, "Man of God, pray for me" - every time - prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need corresponding grace -
    <br>power from above.
    <br>Because you are not on the earth - you are from above.
    <br>At the same time you can do anything on your own,
    <br>but for your security you need grace from above to talk, to sit, like you are standing now...
    <br>We need to know how much we need God.
    <br>You want to sit down.
    <br>You need grace - we call it intimation.
    <br>Intimation - that is, suggestion from the Spirit of God.
    <br>Suggestion, "OK, do it this way. Do it that way..." - intimation.
    <br>Today - what has happened to us?
    <br>We choose to live, we have disconnected, we live a free life.
    <br>This is an area you have to face your prayer now.
    <br>This is why you have Faith Bracelets.
    <br>All this prayer you pray, "This one is after me. God, give me the grace to stand against..."
    <br>Who is after you, when there is intimation, suggestion from the Spirit?
    <br>"Do this, do that..."
    <br>"Take more of me, oh Lord," because we are more of ourselves,
    <br>"and give me more of You".
    <br>"Take more of me and give me more of You."
    <br>More of Your faithfulness - I need it,
    <br>Your kindness - I need it, Your obedience.
    <br>Take more of me - there is so much unfaithfulness, disobedience, hatred in us,
    <br>so much pride, arrogance - we are more of ourselves.
    <br>We are more of ourselves; this is why we measure our Christian life by the blessing we receive.
    <br>If you have breakthrough today, you believem "I am a Christian; God hears my prayers".
    <br>But when you pray and your prayer does not bring forth an answer, you say you are not a Christian.
    <br>We measure ourselves by our situation.
    <br>When it is all well, you say, "Glory be to God; thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>When it is difficult for us, we begin to look at Jesus in a bad light, as if we are not Christians.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We measure our Christian life by what?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell me, when was the last time you dreamt and that exact dream came to pass?
    <br>Or you had a vision and it was exact - and you woke up and the way, dream, vision was...
    <br>When was the last time?
    <br>That should be food for your spirit.
    <br>You don't dream; nightmares - you don't even understand your dreams any longer.
    <br>What kind of life is that?
    <br>What's next?
    <br>What is God's opinion about you
    <br>and what is God's opinion about people around you?
    <br>You don't know.
    <br>What kind of life is this?
    <br>Life without direction.
    <br>There is no direction to the things of the Spirit.
    <br>This is why we are here.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>To restore you, you have a role to play.
    <br>To restore that glory, you have a role to play.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Meditation in the Word makes the Word a part of us.
    <br>You were given a Word that has been anointed for you,
    <br>"Take more of me and give me more of You, oh Lord".
    <br>Like you are sitting down now - I'm not expecting anyone to be sitting down and looking.
    <br>You are supposed to agree with me, "Yes, take more of me..."
    <br>While you are listening, at the same time - "Take more of me; give me more of You,
    <br>more of Your faithfulness" - because you are not faithful.
    <br>And if you are faithful - of what benefit?
    <br>"More of Your faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control, oh Lord.
    <br>Take more of me; give me more of You..."
    <br>This is what I'm expecting you to do.
    <br>Count with your hand and talk with your heart.
    <br>You shouldn't speak it out - talk with your heart and count it with your hand.
    <br>Look at my hand.
    <br>You can't hear anything from me but I talk with my heart.
    <br>Continue like that, be addicted to that.
    <br>When you want to sleep in the night and you lie on the bed, it should be the last thing to do.
    <br>After you lie down, you hold it on your bed, until you finally sleep off.
    <br>What a wonderful journey.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning, you look for it again.
    <br>If something wakes you up at midnight, pick it again - this is it,  "Take more of me".
    <br>You need to be restored.
    <br>If today you receive trillion dollars, that cannot solve your problem
    <br>because already you are disconnected.
    <br>The money will go...
    <br>The money will even create more problems for you because there is no direction.
    <br>You have cut off from the source - God.
    <br>If miracle now comes, who will direct you how to spend the money?
    <br>Anybody can receive miracle, breakthrough - because you are born-again - no.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have to restore yourself in a "little way", that you can sleep and rest.
    <br>When you wake up, you would be able to know what will be next,
    <br>"Do I need to go to work or do I need to stay at home?
    <br>What do I need to do? Oh, I need to fast because this is the vision I had."
    <br>You just fast because of your problem.
    <br>Anytime you fast is because you have a problem.
    <br>Situation measures your Christian life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When it is well, you are a Christian.
    <br>When it is not well for you, no more church, no more prayer - witchdoctor.
    <br>This is what we have given so many people
    <br>but I keep seeing people using it as a "fashion".
    <br>It is not "fashion".
    <br>We only try to encourage you that you can as well use it as "fashion",
    <br>in order to encourage you to get used to it.
    <br>If we now give you cowries, you will not use it.
    <br>But now, you are seeing something beautiful to encourage you; faith and fashion.
    <br>Count with your hand and talk with your heart, "Take more of me, oh Lord and give me more of You".
    <br>And what do you want God to give you?
    <br>His nature.
    <br>Nature of God.
    <br>Build Christ into you, make you a part of Christ, His nature.
    <br>His nature are faithfulness, kindness, goodness, self-control, love and others.
    <br>Take more of me, and your nature is unfaithfulness, arrogance, hatred, pride -
    <br>you want Him to take this and give you...
    <br>Now, I'm concerned about your glory.
    <br>Viewers at home, thank you for your time.
    <br>We are talking about the Faith Bracelet - I know you know much about this.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is one of the greatest tools you have - cherish it.
    <br>It will help you to talk about your faith instead of your doubt.
    <br>It will help you to talk about the One who is fighting for you instead of your battle.
    <br>"Sickness, poverty, nightmare" - these are the things that always run in our brain
    <br>but when you have this, you will begin to talk about the One who is fighting for you.
    <br>It will also help you to focus on your Comforter instead of your enemies.
    <br>"Take more of me; give me more of You..."
    <br>When you have this and you begin to minister it...
    <br>Count it with your hand and talk with your heart.
    <br>It is not disturbing; you can talk to people while you are ministering it.
    <br>- "How are you?"
    <br>- "Fine."
    <br>I can be praying for you at the same time while I'm counting - this is just a hand that is counting,
    <br>my mouth is free to talk.
    <br>When I want to eat, I eat my food.
    <br>When I want to sleep, put it on.
    <br>You need to know the importance of this thing, my friend.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
