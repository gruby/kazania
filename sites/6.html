  <p>    
    <br>Prayer Time
    <br>As we all know, conversion is questionable without deliverance.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Conversion is questionable without deliverance."
    <br>You need deliverance to accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Say, I need deliverance to accept Jesus as my Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Right now, stretch your hand.
    <br>Whatever challenges, whatever situation - right now, begin to free yourself from that bondage!
    <br>Begin to free yourself!
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Begin to free yourself from that bondage!
    <br>Free yourself from every demonic activity!
    <br>Say, I free myself from every demonic activity, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I free myself, my household, my business, my finances, my career, my future,
    <br>my destiny, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to free yourself.
    <br>Right now, we are seeing manifestation of evil spirits,
    <br>as the power and anointing of God is exposing the powers of darkness in the lives of people.
    <br>Continue to watch your screen!
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>There is power power
    <br>Wonder working power
    <br>In the blood of the Lamb
    <br>Open your lips!
    <br>There is power power
    <br>Wonder working power
    <br>In the precious blood of the Lamb
    <br>There is power power
    <br>Wonder working power
    <br>In the blood of the Lamb
    <br>Open your lips! Begin to free yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>I free myself!
    <br>There is power power
    <br>Wonder working power
    <br>In the precious blood of the Lamb
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every demonic power, demonic authority, demonic activity -
    <br>say, I free myself, I disengage myself!
    <br>Begin to disengage yourself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say, you demon, I disengage myself, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to disengage yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Whatever that is not of God, I declare you free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That that is not of God,
    <br>that that is not the will of God, that is not the wish of God - say, out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>Watch your screen, you can see people under the influence of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Say, that that is not of God - out!
    <br>Whatever within you, outside you - I command it out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to release yourself. 
    <br>I say, release yourself!
    <br>I say to your soul, your spirit, your concience, I command that spirit!
    <br>That spirit!
    <br>Release yourself!
    <br>Say, here I am, deliver me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say, here I am!
    <br>Deliver me!
    <br>Right now, stretch your hand towards me.
    <br>Say, I agree with you, T.B. Joshua, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Here I am, in the name of Jesus, deliver me!
    <br>Deliver me!
    <br>Mercy rewrote my life
    <br>I could have fallen
    <br>My soul cast down
    <br>But mercy rewrote my life
    <br>Mercy rewrote my life
    <br>I could have fallen
    <br>My soul cast down
    <br>But mercy rewrote my life
    <br>Mercy rewrote my life
    <br>I could have fallen
    <br>My soul cast down
    <br>But mercy rewrote my life
    <br>Wave your hands and say, "Thank you, Jesus!"
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to pray with you right now.
    <br>Anywhere you are - I may not know where you are, Jesus knows.
    <br>I may not mention your situation, Jesus knows.
    <br>Every constant experience you are having of that bondage - be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It could be sickness, poverty, limitation in progress - be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever you might have eaten through dreams or from the table of the enemy, demons
    <br>that is causing you backwardness, bad luck, sickness, disease, that demonises you -
    <br>be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be flushed away, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be flushed out, by the blood of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see you being released!
    <br>Your business has been released!
    <br>Your health has been restored!
    <br>Your marital life has been restored!
    <br>Your finances have been restored!
    <br>Your business has been restored!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough in your business!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough in your finances!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough in your health!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>Prayer For Viewers
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>I'm no longer condemned! 
    <br>I'm justified!
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past!
    <br>I'm redeemed! 
    <br>I'm saved!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
