  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Father, we thank You.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can see you being delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see you being healed!
    <br>This is a prophetic word.
    <br>Remember, there is a difference between prayer and prophesying.
    <br>I can see you being delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being saved, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Right now, begin to cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Cover your home with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Cover your business, partner, finances, marriage with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>I rejoice with you, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
