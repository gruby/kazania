    <br>A snapshot of T.B. Joshua's ministry
    <br>The man T.B. Joshua
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is the founder and general overseer of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations,
    <br>an international Christian ministry established 27 years ago.
    <br>He is also the principle coordinator of Emmanuel TV,
    <br>the universally renowned media house dedicated to changing lives, reconciling families
    <br>and transforming nations through the Spirit of God.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>I don't know where to start.
    <br>My coming into your midst is just to lay a foundation.
    <br>Today, we start The Synagogue here!
    <br>The ministry began in a humble way, from Prophet T.B. Joshua starting with just eight members.
    <br>Today, the church has grown beyond the confines of any country or continent -
    <br>transcending language and cultural barriers with a message of hope and healing, freedom and deliverance -
    <br>displayed through the mighty miracles at The Synagogue, Church of All Nations.
    <br>Emmanuel TV has become the most watched Christian channel in the whole continent of Africa.
    <br>It has taken YouTube by storm with hundreds of millions of views
    <br>and hundreds of thousands of subscribers.
    <br>Every day, hundreds of sick and afflicted people cry out for the attention of our Lord Jesus.
    <br>As it was so it is today - Jesus Christ healed and still heals all manner of sicknesses and diseases.
    <br>This festering hand is condemned to amputation.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>and she is healed in Jesus' name.
    <br>This is her testimony for the glory of God.
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>There is nothing that I cannot use this hand to do!
    <br>I wash clothes, I cook; I do everything with this hand.
    <br>Another shocking case is Mr. Hennie Ferreira from South Africa who came to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations
    <br>with gaping bones caused by cancer that had spread to both legs.
    <br>The incurable leg cancer that had defied the best medical treatments
    <br>succumbed to the power in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua offers prayers of faith, watch as healing takes place.
    <br>This is the leg. You can see I have got no pain anymore.
    <br>My leg is completely healed.
    <br>Thank God for that!
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Young Nosa came to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations with eye cancer.
    <br>His eye which bore the brunt of his affliction
    <br>soon became the trophy of Christ's victory in his life,
    <br>after prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Sent to the nations, Prophet T.B. Joshua takes the gospel of Jesus Christ to the four corners of the earth.
    <br>Botswana 2005
    <br>The country of Botswana, located in the Southern African region,
    <br>was the first nation where Prophet T.B. Joshua held a crusade.
    <br>People jumped and cheered with excitement and hearts full of faith
    <br>as Prophet T.B. Joshua arrived for the historical visit.
    <br>I am here to do what I am born for, and I am living for, and I am going to die for.
    <br>On the crusade ground, crutches and wheelchairs were raised high
    <br>as people regained their ability to walk.
    <br>The stands were filled to capacity.
    <br>Botswana Crusade 2005
    <br>If millions of this generation are to believe, they must see the evidence
    <br>that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Never a healer like Jesus Christ.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the permanent solution who changes not.
    <br>Who else can justly heal - it's none other than Jesus Christ.
    <br>What a son we have to worship, what a God we have to praise.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Botswana Crusade 2005
    <br>I don't need to use these things anymore.
    <br>I am a free woman.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The Korea for Christ Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is the evidence that there is healing in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thousands witnessed the power in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Indeed, when the power of God is present, freedom, deliverance is just like breathing.
    <br>The Royal Opera House in Sydney, Australia, marks another crusade destination
    <br>where Prophet T.B. Joshua was sent, bringing practical Christianity to the four corners of the earth.
    <br>At the Australia for Christ Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>God used his servant and those who were sick and bound, were healed and set free.
    <br>Chains holding people in bondage were broken in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Australia Crusade 2006
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Australia Crusade 2006
    <br>I had a demon which has been true for fifteen years.
    <br>God has delivered me from it.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Singapore Crusade 2006
    <br>Hundreds of thousands also gathered at the Singapore Crusade with T.B. Joshua
    <br>where God demonstrated His mighty power to heal, deliver and set the captives free.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for this woman, proving that the right hand of God is power indeed.
    <br>Singapore Crusade 2006
    <br>Thank You, my Jesus! Thank You!
    <br>Walking appreciatively after her healing, she not only thanks Jesus,
    <br>but His servant who was used to perform the miracle in His name.
    <br>God really wants to heal, but unless you believe, you will not experience it.
    <br>It's tremendous and this is the first time I have seen
    <br>where deliverance is being done on a massive scale.
    <br>I think he is very anointed to demonstrate the power from God
    <br>so that the people will understand Jesus.
    <br>I am from Indonesia.
    <br>I saw a lot of miracles happening here; it's really amazing.
    <br>To me, I was thinking all this is just magic - I have to be very open -
    <br>and today I really got the privilege and got blessed
    <br>and I accept Jesus as the Saviour of my life.
    <br>Please clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>It is time for healing.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua in Singapore
    <br>Be healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua in Singapore
    <br>You are healed. Walk - you are healed.
    <br>National Healing Campaign in Singapore with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>You are healed. Stand up!
    <br>Those of you that have no faith, I will pray for you -
    <br>your faith will be enough.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Begin to stand up!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Begin to stand up!
    <br>Stand up!

    <br>Thanks, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This is the Pascual Guerrero Olympic Stadium in Cali, Colombia
    <br>where thousands of people from across Latin America and around the world
    <br>streamed in for just a touch from Heaven
    <br>through His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The stadium is filled to capacity, as they await a touch
    <br>that will change the course of the history of their lives forever.
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>There is never a sickness Jesus cannot heal, never a disease Jesus cannot cure,
    <br>never a problem Jesus cannot solve.
    <br>I feel free.
    <br>I can move freely without the lumbar corset I used to use.
    <br>I arrived at home from the stadium by 12am when everyone was sleeping.
    <br>I was full of Christ and anointing like I had just returned from a celebration!
    <br>I took my corset in my hand, threw it on the floor and stamped on it!
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference with Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Thank You for remembering Colombia!
    <br>Pastor Edgar Castano - Bautista Central, Bogota, Colombia
    <br>I am the president of CEDECOL, the Evangelical Federation of Colombia,
    <br>which comprises the majority of the churches in the country.
    <br>He said that his name is Edgar Castano and he is from Bogota
    <br>and he is the president of CEDECOL which is the majority of all the Colombian churches -
    <br>a network of all the churches in Colombia.
    <br>It was impressive to see the huge crowd that came to the event.
    <br>I was especially impressed to see the deliverances and the miracles.
    <br>I strongly believe in the relationship between the Word and miracles,
    <br>that is, between theology and miracles.
    <br>I believe that the Word of God has power to bring miracles.
    <br>In my opinion, it was a great blessing for me to be here.
    <br>He said, it was very powerful to see the miracles and the Word of God, that the two should work together.
    <br>T.B. Joshua travelled to Mexico, home of the Aztec Stadium,
    <br>where thousands rushed to experience God's power and celebrate the Prince of peace
    <br>with songs of praise from renowned musicians like Alvin Slaughter,
    <br>Cece Winans and VaShawn Mitchell.
    <br>The people praised God as they saw Prophet T.B. Joshua being used as the instrument in His hands
    <br>to make the lame walk, deaf to hear and the blind to see.
    <br>Mexico Crusade 2015
    <br>I cannot see - for sixteen years.
    <br>After stating her case of being blind for sixteen years,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for her and she falls under the mighty anointing of God,
    <br>causing blindness to bow and flee at the mention of the name Jesus Christ.
    <br>Mexico Crusade 2015
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I can see!
    <br>Mexico Crusade 2015
    <br>For two and a half years he cannot walk.
    <br>The femur on the left leg is dead, the cartilage is dead.
    <br>For two and a half years he cannot walk.
    <br>He is ten years old.
    <br>Watch as Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for this young boy in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Mexico Crusade 2015
    <br>A clear proof that he no longer needs the crutches
    <br>and can now walk freely after Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for him.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Mexico Crusade 2015
    <br>Help me, Man of God. I cannot move my neck.
    <br>I have a stiff neck.
    <br>As directed by the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for this woman
    <br>wearing a neck collar due to a stiff neck at the prayer line of the Mexico Crusade.
    <br>Watch a spiritual operation as it takes place.
    <br>Jesus has done it again.
    <br>Who could question so much evidence that Jesus lives. He never said goodbye.
    <br>Mexico Crusade 2015
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!
    <br>Mexico Crusade 2015
    <br>After her healing, turning her neck from side to side, up and down, fully restored,
    <br>no one would guess that she was the same young woman who was once wincing in pain
    <br>and subject to a neck collar only hours before.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>The Sky Dome in Seoul, South Korea,
    <br>was the venue of the 2016 South Korea Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua -
    <br>his third appearance in the country.
    <br>Heart and souls were lifted as those in attendance praised the name of the Most High God.
    <br>As the book of Psalms 22:3 says:
    <br>"He inhabits the praises of His people."
    <br>They render songs of worship while waiting expectantly for His much loved servant.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>South Korea Crusade 2016
    <br>I want to be healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>As this woman prays in faith for her healing to come, Prophet T.B. Joshua is used as a point of contact
    <br>for the lightning power of God to become apparent on the scene.
    <br>Surely within moments of contact, healing takes place instantaneously.
    <br>South Korea Crusade 2016
    <br>I want to tell you guys that you shouldn't have doubt.
    <br>As we count our many blessings, doubt will flee.
    <br>This is just one of many cases showing just how great our God is.
    <br>Here is another - a young man whose mobility and movement is hindered by his affliction.
    <br>South Korea Crusade 2016
    <br>I wasn't able to do pushups because of the pains in my wrist and shoulders.
    <br>At the name of Jesus Christ, he is free.
    <br>No longer bound by the pain in his wrist and shoulders,
    <br>he is not only able to do pushups, but exercise every part of his body.
    <br>Who Is TB Joshua???
    <br>The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations started from the giving ministry.
    <br>Right from the beginning of this ministry, it has been a church and giving ministry.
    <br>What comes from the church goes to the ministry of giving to raise the standard of living.
    <br>Help the needy, help the widow, help the orphan.

    <br>T.B. Joshua, through his ministry and Emmanuel TV, has touched so many lives across the world
    <br>through humanitarian and philanthropic deeds,
    <br>including providing academic scholarships for many beneficiaries such as children and young adults.
    <br>These scholarships have enabled them to reach the heights of their academic dreams
    <br>that would have otherwise crashed on the rocks of poverty.
    <br>Beneficiaries such as Miss Olayinka Oduwole, sponsored to the University College of London
    <br>and later Oxford University where she is undergoing her PhD course.
    <br>To Emmanuel TV Partners: Thank you for everything you have done.

    <br>And most importantly: Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Miss Mary Jean Nleya sponsored to Harvard University for her Masters degree programme
    <br>and later internship at the ICC (International Criminal Court) in the Hague.
    <br>My time here at Harvard has been amazing.
    <br>I have been taught by renowned professors. I have dedicated my Masters thesis to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and by the grace of God my Masters thesis was graded with honours by my professor
    <br>who was incredibly impressed with the work that I had done through this thesis.
    <br>Many people see T.B. Joshua's ministry, The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations, in Nigeria as a place of refuge.
    <br>This stranded lady from Mongolia came with her two children in dire need of passports
    <br>and airfare to return to their country.
    <br>This is my passport. The man of God helped me to get my passport.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!, Thank You, God! Thank you, Man of God!
    <br>Thank you, Nigeria.
    <br>T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel.TV Partners provided them with their complete travel expenses
    <br>and worked with the Mongolian embassy in Egypt to acquire the passports of her two children.
    <br>Who Is TB Joshua???
    <br>Tears of desperation fall down the cheeks of this woman from Indonesia.
    <br>She and her family also found help at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations
    <br>after they found themselves in extreme poverty.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua wants to assure you, sir, that he is going to help you to find a job.
    <br>Secondly, he said that he is here today to give you the sum of 500,000 Naira
    <br>and for our sister here from Indonesia who has stated publicly that she is requesting help
    <br>from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, to return to Indonesia with her children,
    <br>the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, said the ministry here, The Synagogue, Church of All Nations
    <br>and Emmanuel TV Partners are going to take up your travelling back to Indonesia with our two children.
    <br>The ministry will take care of getting all of your travel documents, getting your passports -
    <br>every document you need - your flight tickets to the sum of 7,000 USD
    <br>for you and your two children.
    <br>Aside from all of the costs that it will take to transport you back to Indonesia,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners are additionally giving you the sum of 3,000 USD
    <br>so that you can start a new life afresh in Indonesia with your children.
    <br>And your two children will be given scholarships to their various educational levels back in Indonesia.
    <br>Who Is TB Joshua???
    <br>So once again, brethren, this is the message from our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>for himself and Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide who have heard this case.
    <br>As we said, as Christians we cannot afford to look the other way when we see our neighbours in trouble.
    <br>Our sister came in tears to The Synagouge, Church Of All Nations on the streets with her little chrilden
    <br>and today to the glory of God, the mission of Emmanuel TV - you can see it in the lives of this family -
    <br>changing lives, changing nations and changing the world!
    <br>T.B. Joshua's philanthropic deeds have also reached the shores of the Holy land of Israel!
    <br>This is T.B. Joshua and ZAKA Chairman, Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav,
    <br>as he honours him with an award for his humanitarian work.
    <br>Who Is TB Joshua???
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Prays With Rabbi Yehuda At ZAKA's New Site In Israel
    <br>I am Roberts Liardon, a pastor from America and the Author of the "God's Generals" series.
    <br>I hope you have spent a part of your day,
    <br>every day listening to the great messages and the great spirit that comes from this network.
    <br>It will change your life.
    <br>My name is Bill Subritzky and I am from New Zealand -

    <br>This is Kaylin, my wife - a woman of God.
    <br>The Holy Spirit always kept saying: "This is a man of God, support him".
    <br>And I thank God for Prophet Joshua.
    <br>Who Is TB Joshua???
    <br>This is Evangelist C.S. Upthegrove
    <br>and my biggest advice to you is to keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>God will bless you for that! Amen!
    <br>I knew William Branham, Jack Coe, I knew Oral Roberts.
    <br>I knew these men, I go all the way back to the healing days
    <br>and I knew all of the signs and wonders - I have been in their services. Now I rejoice.
    <br>I have been with Kathryn Kuhlman. I have seen so many.
    <br>But listen! Everything that I'm seeing in the ministry right now of Prophet Joshua
    <br>supersedes anthing that I have seen under those ministries.
    <br>It is a greater measure and it is exactly what brother Allen said would happen.
    <br>God used this stamp in the hands of A.A. Allen. So it is my pleasure to present to you this stamp.
    <br>This is the signature stamp of A.A. Allen given to C.S. Upthegrove by the late God's General
    <br>and handed over to another God's General, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
