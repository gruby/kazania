    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I am a fallen angel.
    <br>Why are you asking me?
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>I must stop him by all means.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because of his calling.
    <br>I must stop him by all means.
    <br>What have you done to his career, his marriage?
    <br>I stopped everything and I made him to go out of school.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>How did you enter him?
    <br>Their ancestors have - an oracle.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Speak out! What did you push him to do?
    <br>How dare you control me!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>What have you pushed him to do?
    <br>I have made him to obey me.
    <br>In what way?
    <br>To move into the world.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>If you know how many powers that are backing up, you will not be talking.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>TESTMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chukwuka Cletus Onwuesi.
    <br>I'm from Anambra State (Nigeria), Oka precisely.
    <br>The issues that brought me here are about my education
    <br>and things that have been happening in my life
    <br>from the day I came across a post on social media.
    <br>The title was, 'A fallen angel'.
    <br>When I saw the post, I became so interested that
    <br>immediately I just set my eyes on the post,
    <br>I felt like something was attracting me to look at it more.
    <br>And when I was reading it, it was saying things about the way
    <br>the angels were chased out from Heaven and are somewhere hanging on the air,
    <br>and some were on the rivers and some fallen on the ground.
    <br>But from that day, even whilst I was reading it, it was like a movement,
    <br>it was like something entered inside of me.
    <br>I have not remained the same again from that day.
    <br>And from that day, I started misbehaving.
    <br>It took me into the world; I started drinking alcohol,
    <br>things that I have not done before.
    <br>I saw myself drinking alcohol and following bad gangs -
    <br>doing things that I had never thought I could do in my life.
    <br>Each time I tried to stop doing it, I still found myself doing it again.
    <br>Sometimes when I drank, I would stay until midnight; sometimes, I would not go back home.
    <br>I would stay at my friend's place 3-4 days before I would go back home.
    <br>When I went back home, I would be like, "How did I do this?"
    <br>But next time, I would see myself doing it again.
    <br>From that time, it damaged my life; it caused a lot of damage to me.
    <br>Can you tell us - how did this problem affect your spiritual life?
    <br>What are the things you used to experience spiritually?
    <br>Yes, from the day I set my eyes on this,
    <br>I started myself with this lady in the dream.
    <br>Sometimes she would hold me, we would be swimming in the river.
    <br>Sometimes she would be having intercourse with me in the dream.
    <br>It began to kill my spiritual life; I could no longer pray.
    <br>To pray to God was something else - I began to lose interest in things of God.
    <br>Did you ever have this kind of dream before you looked at those pictures on the net?
    <br>No, I had never seen myself swimming in the dream or any of those things.
    <br>It was from that moment that all those things started.
    <br>And what about your studies - how did it affect it?
    <br>Yes, it affected my studies so much.
    <br>Before I set my eyes on this image, I was in the Federal Polytechnic, Oko.
    <br>I was studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
    <br>I was in ND1 when I set my eyes on this.
    <br>From that moment that I set my eyes on those pictures, everything changed; I lost focus.
    <br>I wasn't sure about what I wanted to be in life.
    <br>From there, it made me to drop out of school.
    <br>It just damaged my life from there.
    <br>We have equally heard from the brother how this images sighted on the net
    <br>affected his life drastically; not only was his whole spiritual life disrupted,
    <br>even his educational career went down.
    <br>He became a school dropout as he lost total concentration on his studies.
    <br>Can you tell us - how did your parents react to this sudden change in your character and your life?
    <br>Yes, they reacted; my father is late, it was my mother, my siblings and I.
    <br>When she saw me - before, she knew how I behaved.
    <br>She knew that I was not violent, the kind of things I would do.
    <br>But from that moment, I changed.
    <br>The way I talked - maybe if she talked to me, the way I would respond.
    <br>The kind of things I would do - she knew I was not the type to go out at night.
    <br>But from then, everything just changed, I started going out at night, it just damaged me.
    <br>It just caused a lot of damage to my life - spiritually, physically, my career, just everything.
    <br>And were there any efforts you put in place to stop all this calamity
    <br>that came over you and your entire life?
    <br>Yes, I have gone to so many places.
    <br>When I dropped out school, that was when I knew it had gone out of hand.
    <br>That I needed someone to help me; I needed help.
    <br>So that was when I now started going from prayer house to prayer house.
    <br>I fasted from Monday till the next day, just to see whether I could come out this cage
    <br>because it was a cage that I was inside.
    <br>But there was no way I could come out of this.
    <br>I tried everything, I did so many things to come out but there was no way.
    <br>How did you finally know about The SCOAN
    <br>and you came on this fateful Sunday and you were delivered?
    <br>I went to visit my auntie.
    <br>When I went there, I narrated my story to her; I told her what was happening.
    <br>She also helped me; we tried to see whether we could solve the problem around there but we couldn't.
    <br>One day she said, "Why don't you just go to The SCOAN in Lagos?"
    <br>But I didn't believe that this place was real.
    <br>But she said that it was real. God was there. That I should go there.
    <br>That when I went there, God would settle my matter.
    <br>And that was how I came here last week Sunday.
    <br>I was sitting over there.
    <br>The man of God was touching people.
    <br>I was praying that he would get to where I was sitting to touch me.
    <br>But when he was coming close, I don't know, I was kind of anxious.
    <br>I started feeling somehow inside of me.
    <br>Something was telling me to leave.
    <br>But I just held myself there.
    <br>When the man of God just touched the next person, somebody that was sitting next to me,
    <br>just coming to me, I didn't know what happened, I just screamed.
    <br>From there, I didn't know what else happened; I was just watching the video now.
    <br>This is the first time I am watching the video to see what really happened.
    <br>So you mean, all what happened after the man of God stretched forth his hand -
    <br>as you explained now, the man of God was praying for people, he had not even reached your side,
    <br>he had not even touched you but you felt like a force and that was all you could remember.
    <br>You are just watching the screen and seeing exactly
    <br>how the evil spirit manifested and confessed who it actually was.
    <br>And that is what we are watching on the screen of our television on the left-hand side.
    <br>We are seeing when the brother was right under the influence of the spirit,
    <br>when the evil spirit that had been tormenting his life was exposed
    <br>through the power of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
    <br>working in the life of His anointed one, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>That was how he was delivered on that fateful Sunday.
    <br>So ever since your deliverance, can you tell us the changes you have seen in your life.
    <br>Ever since my deliverance took place, from that day till today,
    <br>I have not had such dreams again, of seeing that lady in the dream,
    <br>or seeing myself in the river or making love with her or anything.
    <br>And I have been sleeping so fine.
    <br>Just that Sunday to Monday, I slept, I woke up around 8 am.
    <br>It was someone that woke me up, saying, "Ah, this is 8 o'clock, you have to wake up".
    <br>When I woke up at that side, it was like something left me.
    <br>My body was heavy before but from that moment, I felt light.
    <br>I felt like something big was taken out of my body.
    <br>I just felt light and from that day 'til today, I have started reading my Bible.
    <br>I started understanding, I started believing in God again.
    <br>It was marvellous.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Yes, we know that the evidence of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>When Jesus Christ delivers you, He delivers you completely and effectually.
    <br>We have seen the evidence of that deliverance in the life of the brother
    <br>who said that ever since his deliverance, all those evil attacks
    <br>he used to have in the dreams are no more
    <br>and his relationship with God has improved to the level
    <br>that he now has interest in the Word of God.
    <br>And we know that is the very foundation.
    <br>It is the Word of God that will set us on that good road to good life.
    <br>We know there are many people that are still in that situation you were in before
    <br>and many are about to and they will need a word of advice from you
    <br>which we know will go a long way to educate the youth.
    <br>So what advice do you have for people listening to you, especially the youth all over the world?
    <br>My advice to the youth and people watching all over the world is that
    <br>you should not watch or read everything you see on social media.
    <br>Some of these things are demonic, like the one I watched about fallen angels.
    <br>It was demonic and it caged me from that moment.
    <br>So you have to make sure that you don't get interested in everything you see.
    <br>Hallelujah. We have heard a wonderful advice from the brother.
    <br>And we equally want to advise you, now that Jesus Christ has delivered and set you free,
    <br>you should make sure, you follow Him along the way, making His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>and we know the blessing and deliverance you have received will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus!
