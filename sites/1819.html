    <br>Good Morning from Lithuania!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team and Partners send you greetings.
    <br>Today, we are in Lithuania, Northern Europe.
    <br>The quarantine was announced on 16th March due to the issue of virus.
    <br>During the quarantine period, it is recommended to stay at home,
    <br>especially the elderly ones who have a high risk of being infected with virus due to their age.
    <br>Moreover, people are losing jobs due to companies' financial issues.
    <br>The business sector is shrinking and experiencing financial backlashes
    <br>due to limitations and restrictions of movement and close contact.
    <br>The economy of Europe is paralysed in many sectors because borders and airports are closed.
    <br>People are facing difficulties to purchase daily meals, especially the elderly ones.
    <br>Private business people cannot operate and run their businesses.
    <br>People are being fired from jobs, losing any source of income.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners worldwide
    <br>have responded to Lithuanian people's voices, and have contributed with food packages
    <br>and cash gifts for people who are in a difficult situation regarding restrictions caused by the sickness.
    <br>Right now, we are in the kitchen of a local church using it for logistics and packing.
    <br>We will start the packing process in a few minutes
    <br>and we will prepare the boxes to be delivered to people in need.
    <br>The food parcels will be delivered in person to the needy
    <br>and the packing and delivery team will be obeying the rules and instructions
    <br>provided by the Lithuanian government;
    <br>for example, keeping a safe distance of at least two meters and wearing their masks.
    <br>Good bless everyone!
    <br>See you soon.

    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, viewers all over the world and Emmanuel TV Partners!
    <br>We are here in Kaunas, Lithuania moving around helping the needy
    <br>during this difficult time caused by virus.
    <br>We are here with this lady, giving food and finances to help and support her.
    <br>Now, we will ask her how the virus has affected her life.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Lithuania Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>These times are very difficult for her.
    <br>She belongs to the age of high risk people.
    <br>She is elderly and the government strictly recommends not to go outside their homes,
    <br>not to go to the stores because this is the best way to prevent them from getting virus.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Lithuania Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>So, she is very thankful to the people who have supported and helped her with this blessing.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Lithuania Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>She was looking for somebody to bring food for her from the supermarket
    <br>but now she has received this blessing from God, so she is very happy.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Lithuania Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>When the virus situation began here in Lithuania,
    <br>she lost her job and her stable income every month.
    <br>They are renting this flat and currently do not have the finances to pay the rent,
    <br>so now it is a difficult time for this family.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Lithuania Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>This food will support her needs, and this financial support she has received
    <br>will help them to cover part of the rent for the flat, so she is very happy.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Lithuania Outreach
    <br>To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>This was very unexpected and she is very happy.
    <br>She praises the Lord Jesus Christ for this help and support.
    <br>Thank you, Emmanuel TV Partners and The SCOAN!

    <br>Hello. I'm Irna Zabulionyte.
    <br>We have a women's crisis centre, a charitable canteen and a children's daycare centre.
    <br>A lot of people who already had problems surviving during this period have more difficulties.
    <br>It is already much harder for them to survive.
    <br>I am really thankful to Emmanuel TV who noticed our organisation and helped us.
    <br>We are thankful for these products and your support,
    <br>which we will use to continue our work of helping people.
