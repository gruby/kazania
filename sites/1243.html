  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen to me.
    <br>Hear the voice of God.
    <br>Your heart is the man himself.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>The heart is so important because it must be at its best for God.
    <br>For your heart to be at its best for God, it must be spiritual.
    <br>Our heart is the prayer room, temple of God, contact,
    <br>communication point, landing point for the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Where is your heart -
    <br>full of unforgiveness, bitterness, pain of the past, bad feelings towards others?
    <br>That root in your heart that caused you unforgiveness, bitterness,
    <br>bad feelings towards others - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive a free heart - a heart without bitterness,
    <br>a heart without unforgiveness,
    <br>a heart without bad feelings,
    <br>a heart without pain of the past, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Receive!
    <br>Be free!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, you need a free heart to follow Jesus.
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>No turning back
    <br>Only a free heart, a free spirit can follow Jesus.
    <br>For your heart to be free, it must be spiritual
    <br>because the Spirit of God expresses Himself through our hearts.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, begin to see yourself the way Jesus sees you.
    <br>Jesus sees you as a person without affliction, stagnation, poverty.
    <br>Begin to see yourself the way Jesus sees you.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, locate me in Your mercy and deliver me, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, open your lips.
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy.
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy and deliver me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Deliver me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Free me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Locate me in Your mercy.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, locate me in Your mercy.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, locate me in Your mercy and deliver me, in the name of Jesus.
