    388 - WHAT TO DO WHEN PRAYERS SEEM UNANSWERED - T.B. Joshua Sermon
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>Where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I'm in His presence".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Today, we shall dwell on love and forgiveness and how they are related.
    <br>ENCOURAGING WORDS
    <br>Let's say, "Encouraging words".
    <br>Let's quickly look at John 4; our key note shall be taken from verse 10.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>"Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus
    <br>made and baptized more disciples than John
    <br>(though Jesus Himself did not baptise, but His disciples),
    <br>He left Judea and departed again to Galilee."
    <br>Let's go to our key note - verse 10.
    <br>"Jesus answered and said to her, 'If you knew the gift of God, and who it is
    <br>who says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him,
    <br>and He would given you living water.' "
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This is about the sinful Samaritan woman.
    <br>Jesus did not reject her
    <br>because He would never reject anyone who comes to Him to be cleansed from sin.
    <br>He would never...
    <br>People are asking the same question in a different way.
    <br>What is the question?
    <br>Can any sin be forgiven?
    <br>If the Spirit of God will permit me, I will answer this question before we move forward.
    <br>What you have read here; you should take it from verse 1 to the end...
    <br>Jesus did not reject her because He would never reject anyone
    <br>who comes to Him to be cleansed from sin.
    <br>He would never...
    <br>To support what we are talking about - Mark 3:28.
    <br>"Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men,
    <br>and whatever blasphemies they may utter."
    <br>Jesus accepts anyone who comes to Him in faith,
    <br>even those who previously rejected Him.
    <br>He would still accept them.
    <br>Jesus did not reject the sinful Samaritan woman but rather He showed her
    <br>love and acceptance by offering her living water.
    <br>This means, Jesus would never reject anyone who comes to Him to be cleansed from sin.
    <br>Our God gives healing when we are sick.
    <br>You, the sick, Jesus will never reject you today, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I'm prophesying to your life.
    <br>Our God gives blessing when we are poor.
    <br>You, the poor, Jesus will never reject you.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Are you barren?
    <br>Our God says, there shall be no barren in the house.
    <br>Jesus would never reject you today, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>There shall be no what?
    <br>There shall be no barren in the house.
    <br>You, the barren, Jesus would never reject you today, in Jesus' name!
    <br>You, the troubled ones, whatever you are facing,
    <br>what are you troubled about?
    <br>Jesus will never reject you today!
    <br>Jesus never rejected the sinful Samaritan woman
    <br>but rather He showed her acceptance and love
    <br>by offering her living water.
    <br>Jesus accepts anyone who comes to Him in faith.
    <br>Forget about your past, whatever you might have said, all sorts of things,
    <br>"Over my dead body would I go to that Synagogue".
    <br>Whatever you might have prayed, banned, rebuked in the past, Jesus will not reject you today.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Don't misinterpret God's silence as rejection.
    <br>Maybe you have been praying for this, that,
    <br>and you are in the haste, hurry - you need an answer urgently.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't misinterpret God's silence as rejection".
    <br>God's silence may be to reform you.
    <br>God's silence may be to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>God's silence may be to strengthen you desire.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't misinterpret God's silence as rejection".
    <br>God's silence may be to strengthen your desire for Him.
    <br>God's silence may be to reform you for a better position.
    <br>God's silence may be to stop you awhile in order to move you close
    <br>to His love and acceptance.
    <br>Don't misinterpret God's silence as rejection.
    <br>WHAT TO DO WHEN PRAYERS SEEM UNANSWERED - T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Let's look at the Book of Romans 8; I will read verse 35.
    <br>"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"
    <br>- Who?
    <br>- [No one.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Nothing and nothing can separate us from God's love.
    <br>Nothing can separate us from the love of God.
    <br>What would make you doubt God's love?
    <br>Hurtful hard time,
    <br>facing hatred,
    <br>hunger or homelessness?
    <br>What would make you doubt God's love?
    <br>WHAT TO DO WHEN PRAYERS SEEM UNANSWERED - T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>What about painful persecution,
    <br>betrayal by friends or families?
    <br>What would make you doubt God's love?
    <br>Or worse yet, your own awful sin?
    <br>What would make you doubt God's love?
    <br>The answer is: nothing.
    <br>Nothing and nothing.
    <br>There is not one thing evil enough, ugly enough, heinous enough,
    <br>deep enough, powerful enough to stop God from loving you.
    <br>Nothing anyone could possibly do to you can sever or cut that connection.
    <br>Nothing you could ever do can dam the unstoppable love of God.
    <br>His love for you in unmeasurable, unrelenting, unceasing,
    <br>unstoppable, undeniable, unconditional.
    <br>WHAT TO DO WHEN PRAYERS SEEM UNANSWERED - T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Who is worthy?
    <br>ENCOURAGING WORDS
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Who is worthy?"
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>That is the question now.

    <br>Who is worthy of my hands, feet, mind and heart?
    <br>Who is worthy dying for or going to jail for?

    <br>My brothers and sisters, church, listen:
    <br>Worthy is the Lamb.
    <br>He was slain to receive power, wisdom, strength, honour, praise and adoration.

    <br>The Darling of Heaven crucified
    <br>Worthy is the Lamb
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
