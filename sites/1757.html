  <p>    
    <br>Is this your daughter?
    <br>Man of God, please help my daughter; that is why I'm here.
    <br>Prophecy time
    <br>You see the way your daughter looked at me.
    <br>She took after her father.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Come out here.
    <br>She is not the only one having this challenge.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is a psychological problem.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Sometimes, she can just urinate on herself and do all sorts of things.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Henrietta Aguwa and the lady beside me is my daughter Margaret Aguwa
    <br>and we are from the U.S.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>We came to church last Sunday
    <br>and the man of God walked to us and said to me, your daughter behaves like her father.
    <br>He gave another prophecy that she has psychological problems.
    <br>I confirm these prophecies to be true.
    <br>In the first place she behaves like her father, I confirm that to be true because
    <br>her father said it that when he was at her age, when he was young,
    <br>he used to act exactly how she is acting now, behaving out of control,
    <br>following men, being out on the streets, taking drugs and following bad gangs.
    <br>So I confirm that prophecy to be true.
    <br>My daughter, I confirm that she suffers from psychological problems.
    <br>Before the psychological problems, she was a straight A student.
    <br>She made good grades in school, she was even doing her premiere at the University of Oklahoma.
    <br>Then all of a sudden, she started acting differently,
    <br>engaging in bad gangs and taking drugs.
    <br>She dropped out of school; she came back and she preferred to be on the street.
    <br>She would just pack her clothes, pack her things and just go on the streets.
    <br>We have houses for her to stay. We have everything that she needs to stay to live a good life,
    <br>but she prefers to live on the street.
    <br>That psychological problem led her to be behaving out of order,
    <br>laughing unnecessarily because of the drugs she was taking.
    <br>So the school noticed it and said other students are not comfortable with her behaviour
    <br>and then they had to drop her out of the school.
    <br>She continued being out of order, she was hearing voices that told her to do bad things.
    <br>She even cut herself.
    <br>Anything that the voice told her to do, she would do it.
    <br>Even one night she woke up and lit fire in the house while everybody was sleeping.
    <br>It's God that saved us because the smoke alarm went off and
    <br>and she was taken to jail for that for about six months
    <br>but by the grace of God she was released.
    <br>After she was released, it got worse because she continued and it even got worse
    <br>so we were all tired.
    <br>She was texting men and women if they wanted to have sex.
    <br>She would get on dating sites - just sexual things that the voices were telling her to do
    <br>- both men and women.
    <br>She didn't care who the person was.
    <br>She was taking drugs, smoking cigarettes.
    <br>Any type of thing they can smoke, she would smoke it if you gave it to her.
    <br>She didn't care - she would put everybody in danger and leave the door open.
    <br>She would wake up at night; she couldn't even sleep, she would be up.
    <br>She would pretend like she was going to sleep.
    <br>After everybody had gone to sleep, she would wake up
    <br>and open the door wide while everybody was sleeping, putting everybody's life in danger.
    <br>She would even walk out - she didn't care for her own life.
    <br>When we found out about this problem, we took her to everywhere we could
    <br>- psych. hospitals, several psych. hospitals from state to state in the United States.
    <br>Still, she would not take her medication. When she took them, she would not take them correctly.
    <br>Even when she took them, she still continued; it still got worse, everybody was tired.
    <br>They started giving her injections to help her sleep every week.
    <br>They started giving the injections every week, every month; it still continued.
    <br>This problem has affected the family that everybody is tired of her.
    <br>They are even trying to give up.
    <br>I was looking for everywhere for help till I was searching the internet for spiritual help.
    <br>I was searching for any help - mental health help, spiritual help, religious help.
    <br>Then I saw videos and I started watching The SCOAN videos.
    <br>and I said this is where I need to bring her to, I found the solution.
    <br>So, that's why I brought her here.
    <br>The man of God pointed out the problem and said, she behaves like her father
    <br>and the psychological problem which led to bedwetting when she is drunk
    <br>and wasted; then she behaves anyhow.
    <br>What are the changes you have seen in the last one week?
    <br>Yes, for the last one week she has really changed a lot.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Now she doesn't look for men. She doesn't text.
    <br>There were men around where we were but she wasn't interested in looking for sexual gratification
    <br>and even women - she said she doesn't have any urge for that.
    <br>She doesn't have any urge for drugs anymore, she is not hearing voices anymore.
    <br>And now she is reading the Bible.
    <br>The Grace Restorer, He has indeed restored our sister from a chronic mental problem.
    <br>Now today she is here, to the glory of God, standing because the Lord has healed her completely.
    <br>What about her sleeping, can she sleep now?
    <br>Now she sleeps real good. She sleeps deep and fine, and wakes up.
    <br>Now she doesn't need any drug to help her sleep.
    <br>She doesn't need injections to help her sleep. Glory be to God.
    <br>Hallelujah! And as far as you can remember, for how many years was she suffering from this problem?
    <br>As far as I can remember, she started like six years ago
    <br>but from what she was saying, it was like ten years ago.
    <br>We didn't realise all these things until six years ago
    <br>when we started seeing some signs, then it got worse.
    <br>I just give all glory and honour to God for His mercy and I thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>who has been given to this generation to help us.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord! Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua!
    <br>Mrs Henrietta Aguwa & Daughter
    <br>Delivered From Drug Addiction And Mental Disorder
    <br>After Prophecy
    <br>My name is Margaret Aguwa.
    <br>We came to T.B. Joshua's church for deliverance and he prophesied that I act like my dad
    <br>and I have mental problems - all that's true.
    <br>Well, it started when I was a child, I think I was five years old.
    <br>Then I went to high school and I started doing drugs.
    <br>When I started doing drugs, that's when I started having mental problems.
    <br>I got on websites, blogs, just browsing around, playing games.
    <br>Every now and then I would watch porn.
    <br>I met people on dating websites; it's different from blogs.
    <br>I went on dating websites, met people, went on dates with them
    <br>and then maybe we had sex or we just went on a date.
    <br>I first started with weed and then I started taking ecstasy and methamphetamines.
    <br>When I took meth, that's when I started having mental problems.
    <br>Ok, it was the drugs that led to mental problems.
    <br>And at that point you started hearing voices - what were the things the voices were telling you?
    <br>They were telling me that I was fake. They were telling me that I should kill myself.
    <br>They were telling me that I was pathetic.
    <br>I tried to kill my uncle but he was asleep.
    <br>I was going to light him on fire but something stopped me.
    <br>I just lit the outside of his door on fire. I went to jail.
    <br>You went to jail and after that what happened?
    <br>I did that before I went to jail.
    <br>Ok, we can see on the screen of our television, she is trying to show us the marks on her hands.
    <br>Like she said, she has made several attempts to kill herself, just because she was hearing voices.
    <br>And all what the voices were telling her was to harm people around her and harm herself.
    <br>I have been to mental hospitals. That's all.
    <br>Mrs Henrietta Aguwa & Daughter
    <br>Delivered From Drug Addiction And Mental Disorder
    <br>After Prophecy
    <br>You can see on that picture there - that was when she put the house on fire and she was taken to jail.
    <br>That was the picture they took during that time, and it was on the news - Oklahoma Times.
    <br>I can sleep fine, and I don't have sexual urges any more.
    <br>I don't have any desire to take drugs.
    <br>What about the voices you said you were hearing in the past?
    <br>I don't hear voices anymore.
    <br>So today all those experiences have stopped?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Christ Jesus.
    <br>Mrs Henrietta Aguwa & Daughter
    <br>Delivered From Drug Addiction And Mental Disorder
    <br>After Prophecy
    <br>Now if you are asked to advise the young ones who are listening to you,
    <br>going by your experience, what do you have to say to them?
    <br>Don't do drugs and listen to your parents.
    <br>Don't do drugs and listen to your parents.
    <br>Apart from that, what else do you want to say to viewers all around the world?
    <br>Trust in Jesus.
    <br>To trust in Jesus.
    <br>Mama, can you tell us, how come you never knew that your daughter was having those problems
    <br>for a very long time because she mentioned these problems started when she was five years?
    <br>And to you - you were mentioning six years ago. What do you have to say?
    <br>Well, I'm shocked and surprised that she said it started when she was five years old,
    <br>having sexual encounters with the opposite sex.
    <br>I did not notice it, her dad did not notice it. None of us noticed it.
    <br>This is the first time I'm hearing it too here
    <br>and I'm surprised and I'm shocked.
    <br>We were busy fending for the family -
    <br>going to school, working and trying to care for them at the same time.
    <br>So that is where the destruction was, I guess.
    <br>We did not see any sign of this when she was five years old.
    <br>The first time we noticed that something was wrong with her was when she was 16,
    <br>in her final year in high school and we even called the police, her dad called the police because of that.
    <br>She jumped through the window.
    <br>We went to church and she was texting in church.
    <br>Her dad saw it, took the phone from her and said she was grounded.
    <br>That she could not be going to church and be doing that.
    <br>And today your daughter is delivered.
    <br>What word of advice do you have for youth and mothers all around the world?
    <br>My advice for the youth and all parents around the world:
    <br>Our children should be priority in our lives.
    <br>We might be running, looking for our own education and our own money - no.
    <br>We think that all they need is their food and shelter.
    <br>They also need spiritual help.
    <br>We took them to church but we still needed to do more.
    <br>If this happened since she was five years old, we didn't do enough
    <br>but let's be more attentive to our children, let's pay more attention.
