    <br>I can see you being saved.
    <br>I said, I can see you being delivered.
    <br>This must come to pass.
    <br>The Fruit Of The Womb Meeting With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>This mantle - what you read in the Bible - is nothing but the truth.
    <br>Everyone that touched the mantle, apron of Paul was delivered.
    <br>AWESOME Fruit Of The Womb Testimony!
    <br>By an act of faith, and in accordance with the Book of Acts 19
    <br>where those who touched Apostle Paul's aprons were healed,
    <br>the man of God, T.B. Joshua, touches the mantle
    <br>as he prepares to give it to the many barren couples
    <br>who have come seeking their miracle baby.
    <br>We can see the instant reaction of this woman as she touches the anointed mantle
    <br>and her years of barrenness are put to an end.
    <br>The root cause of people's affliction is being exposed and dispelled
    <br>as they come into contact with the mantle that T.B. Joshua had been using to sanctify.
    <br>Here we can see Donovan and Nicky Vey as they too hold the mantle by faith,
    <br>believing their miracle is just a moment away.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Our names are Mr and Mrs Donovan Vey, and this is our baby daughter, Deborah Vey.
    <br>The problem that brought us to The SCOAN was irregular menstruation
    <br>and barrenness for many years.
    <br>We attended The Fruit Of The Womb Service in December 2009,
    <br>and as you can see on the recording,
    <br>when the man of God handed out the mantle
    <br>and when I touched the mantle, I felt the anointing of God move through my body.
    <br>Two to three days after The Fruit Of The Womb Service, my menstruation started.
    <br>It was heavier than I had ever experienced in my life before.
    <br>We went back to South Africa and we met as husband and wife.
    <br>In February 2010, we found out that I was pregnant.
    <br>In May 2010, as you can see on the recording, we came for testimony expecting our first baby.
    <br>We are here today to give glory to God and to show our baby girl
    <br>and that we are proud mother and father of our daughter.
    <br>If God can do it for us, He can do it for you.
    <br>AWESOME Fruit Of The Womb Testimony!
    <br>If you know God has addressed your situation, let me see your hand.
    <br>Stand up if you know God has addressed your situation.
    <br>AWESOME Fruit Of The Womb Testimony!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>AWESOME Fruit Of The Womb Testimony!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Donovan Vey.
    <br>My wife next to me is Nicky Vey, and our daughter, Deborah Vey.
    <br>We came to The Fruit Of The Womb Meeting in 2009
    <br>and as you saw on the screen,
    <br>I actually touched the mantle.
    <br>When I touched the mantle from the man of God,
    <br>I felt the Holy Spirit power move through me and I knew that the end had come.
    <br>We went back to South Africa and it was in February
    <br>that my wife discovered that she was pregnant.
    <br>We came back last year to give our testimony.
    <br>Here we are today; I am a dad.
    <br>From my side, I just want to say: What is your issue?
    <br>If God can do it for me and my wife, definitely, He can do it for you.
    <br>Yes, this is what we want to hear.
    <br>We have heard it. Simple.
    <br>If God can do it for him, there is no situation God cannot address.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: God is greater than my situation.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
