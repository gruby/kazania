    <br>Right now, begin to cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>Cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>The Blood of Jesus
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you -
    <br>be it your weaknesses -
    <br>whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself -
    <br>be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to disconnect yourself.
    <br>Disconnect yourself from satan.
    <br>Disconnect yourself!
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>to connect your business to himself,
    <br>to connect your career to himself,
    <br>to connect your marriage to himself,
    <br>to connect your life to himself - be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free!

    <br>The bank of everything is from Heaven.
    <br>Whatever challenges you are going through right now, I see you free, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>affliction,
    <br>setback,
    <br>stagnation -
    <br>whatever challenges you are in - I can see you being free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When Jesus says, "Yes", no one can say, "No".
    <br>Don't forget the same anointing that said to the woman,
    <br>"You have not been seeing your menstruation for a while,
    <br>right now, go and check - your menstruation has come"
    <br>and the woman immediately saw her menstruation.
    <br>Whatever challenges you are in -
    <br>I can see your freedom!
    <br>Whatever challenges you are in - be it nightmare, career failure, stagnation, rejection, hardship -
    <br>whatever challenges you are going through, whatever challenges you are in -
    <br>I can see your freedom!
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>What could be the challenges?
    <br>Depression, affliction in your blood, bones, kidneys or in your liver -
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Never an affliction Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Whatever challenges, situation you are in - I can see your freedom!

    <br>I can see your breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>I said I want to celebrate Easter with you.
    <br>There is no other way to celebrate it than to give you your salvation.
    <br>Salvation means to be set free.
    <br>And once you are set free, all other things -
    <br>breakthrough, blessing, healing, freedom will be added!
    <br>I can see your breakthrough!
    <br>Say, breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough - in my career!
    <br>Breakthrough - in my business!
    <br>Breakthrough - in my family!
    <br>Breakthrough - in my health!
    <br>Breakthrough!

    <br>My name is Blessing Okey Odazi.
    <br>I came from Delta State.
    <br>Just like the man of God prophesied to me that the fibroid will surely come out.
    <br>As we were singing worship songs, I felt a sensation and saw blood gushing out.
    <br>I came because of the multiple fibroids I have been having for the past eight years.
    <br>I have tried many things but nothing helped.
    <br>Today, I decided to come to The SCOAN. Praise God!
    <br>I thank God what He has done in my life.
    <br>How do you feel now that the fibroid is coming out?
    <br>I felt restless so I kept moving but I am okay now.
    <br>So if your own fibroid can come out,
    <br>because the man of God said, you have a fibroid and that fibroid will come out,
    <br>and the man of God has also said everyone's chain has been broken,
    <br>what do you think has happened to everyone?
    <br>Everybody's chain will be broken too, in Jesus' name!
    <br>My chain has broken today, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Everybody's own is broken too, in Jesus' name!
