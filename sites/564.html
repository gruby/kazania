    <br>This is the section of pregnant women,
    <br>who are here for safe delivery.
    <br>Many of them have been booked for operations because of complications.
    <br>They are here looking in faith to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ to be free
    <br>so that they can deliver their babies safely without any complications,
    <br>without any surgical operations.
    <br>BABY BORN As PASTOR PRAYS!!!
    <br>Here is one of those have come today for safe delivery,
    <br>BABY BORN AS PASTOR PRAYS!!!
    <br>The resurrection power of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is working in the midst of the people.
    <br>I can see what is happening to this pregnant woman
    <br>See what she passed out as the man of God stretched forth his hand towards her,
    <br>praying for her in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Receive deliverance!
    <br>Be free! Out!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Out, Ezekiel!
    <br>BABY BORN AS PASTOR PRAYS!!!
    <br>What you have just watched is the miraculous birth of baby Ezekiel.
    <br>Mrs. Geneva Amam had come to the SCOAN with complications in her pregnancy.
    <br>The doctors had diagnosed a tight cervix
    <br>for which they had booked her for an operation.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for Geneva in the prayer line
    <br>and immediately, her water broke and she went into labour.
    <br>Some moments later, Prophet T.B. Joshua went to her at the labour room
    <br>and spoke a word of prophecy,
    <br>identifying both the name and the gender of the child,
    <br>saying, "Ezekiel, come out!"
    <br>Instantly, baby Ezekiel was delivered.
    <br>Testimony time
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Geneva Amam, I am from Imo state.
    <br>I am 30 years old.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN last Sunday
    <br>was that of a tight cervix for which I was booked for an operation
    <br>and also that of high blood pressure.
    <br>When all these things were happening, I was rejected by 2 to 3 hospitals.
    <br>They said the baby was too big and they could not handle the baby.
    <br>The one that accepted later said that because of the high blood pressure,
    <br>they would not be able to operate on me.
    <br>The cervix was tight, there was no way the baby could come out
    <br>and my blood pressure was too high for them to operate on me.
    <br>So my husband now took me down to The SCOAN
    <br>where I was arranged at the emergency section
    <br>and the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>Immediately he touched my foot with his foot, the water that
    <br>was holding the baby and making the cervix tight burst
    <br>and poured out instantly and my body became cool and calm.
    <br>After some time, labour started, yet the baby could not come out.
    <br>The man of God came and prayed for me and said, "Ezekiel, come out!"
    <br>Instantly - where the power came from, I can't imagine -
    <br>the baby just came out; all I heard was the cry of a baby and he's a baby boy.
    <br>I was shocked, I was surprised. I said, "How?
    <br>How did the man of God know that I was carrying a baby boy?"
    <br>The whole thing - I was like crying, but I give God the glory
    <br>because the baby is alive and I myself, I'm alive, strong and healthy.
    <br>That is why we are here today to glorify the name of God, to bless His name
    <br>because what man cannot do, God did through the able hand of
    <br>His anointed servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And here, you can see me carrying Ezekiel.
    <br>I thank God for that; I give God all the glory.
    <br>I am Mr. Patrick Amam.
    <br>The woman next to me is my wife, Mrs Geneva Amam.
    <br>The baby's name is Ezekiel Amam. He was delivered in last Sunday's service.
    <br>We had the problem of my wife being unable to deliver her baby safely in the hospital.
    <br>Before 4 am that Sunday morning, I called the hospital -
    <br>she told me that she had not delivered, and worse, still that she had a tight cervix.
    <br>I ran down to the hospital as early as 4 am.
    <br>I noticed that my wife had even become weak and had developed high blood pressure.
    <br>I knew that we needed God's intervention.
    <br>We could not trust the medical operation they had given us as an option for the delivery.
    <br>I told my wife, "All you need is God's intervention".
    <br>I took her away. The hospital objected.
    <br>I said, "Keep our load. If God intervenes, I can return her to you."
    <br>Then they allowed us to go.
    <br>We came here directly - my wife and I to the emergency line of The SCOAN.
    <br>We had the luck that the man of God came and prayed for her.
    <br>The first time the man of God prayed for her, the cervix opened,
    <br>the water gushed out and my wife felt cool in her system.
    <br>I had peace; I was happy.
    <br>The man of God came the second time and mentioned the sex of the baby
    <br>while the baby was still in the womb - 'Ezekiel' three times.
    <br>He said, "Ezekiel, come out!" and the boy rushed out immediately and cried.
    <br>There was jubilation everywhere in the church.
    <br>We give God the glory.
    <br>I thank God for this mercy and favour for my family.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
