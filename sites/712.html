    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>(Good Morning!)
    <br>Emmanuel! (God is with us!)
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I say "Good Morning" to you.
    <br>(Good Morning!)
    <br>Morning to your life, [Amen!]
    <br>to your business, [Amen!]
    <br>your career, [Amen!]
    <br>your family [Amen!]
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>(Good Morning!)
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The Lord asked me to come to your midst.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And also to share with you some of the present challenges.
    <br>They are everywhere; it is everywhere!
    <br>Where can we go from these challenges?
    <br>(Nowhere!)
    <br>I can't hear you
    <br>(Nowhere!)
    <br>It is epidemic.
    <br>I don't know where you can go from these challenges.
    <br>Even if you go underground, the challenges are there.
    <br>If you decided to go inside the sea, you will find challenges there.
    <br>Air? Oh my God! You will see clouds covering you.
    <br>Everywhere are challenges.
    <br>You choose to go inside the bush; you will see challenges there.
    <br>I want to say, it is the season; the season of challenges.
    <br>How do these challenges relate to our Christian life?
    <br>Your challenges could be this or that; you know the kind of challenges you have.
    <br>There is no one without challenges.
    <br>Yes, I mean there is no one without limitations.
    <br>Okay? So everyone, everyone, everyone, just everyone.
    <br>It is impossible to live without challenges.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(It is impossible to live without challenges.)
    <br>I can't hear you
    <br>(It is impossible to live without challenges.)
    <br>It is impossible to live without challenges.
    <br>Where can you go from these?
    <br>So, how do these challenges relate to your Christian life?
    <br>Does it mean you are not a Christian? Or what does this mean? Having challenges?
    <br>The type of challenges you have is not the type of challenges I have.
    <br>The area you have challenges is not the area I have mine.
    <br>When we talk  of challenges, knowledge is not the key; obedience is.
    <br>When we talk of what?
    <br>(Challenges)
    <br>Knowledge is not the key - because you apply knowledge.
    <br>That cannot work.
    <br>Knowledge is not the key, but obedience is.
    <br>Challenges determine where you are spiritually.
    <br>Viewers, are you there?
    <br>Yes, listen to me: Challenges determine where you are spiritually.
    <br>This is why knowledge is not the key; obedience is.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>Challenges reveal the true condition of man's heart.
    <br>When you see someone who is very quiet, gentle - this reminds me of one of my evangelists.
    <br>When he first came to join us, people said, "This man is very quiet".
    <br>Indeed, he was very quiet and smiley.
    <br>People said, "Oh, he is nice". Everybody wanted to rally around him.
    <br>I said, "Wow! No, it is too early".
    <br>Let's pose challenges and see whether he will remain  the same.
    <br>Okay, go and accuse him wrongly - just any accusation.
    <br>"Come on! You stole my money! You stole my money!"
    <br>"You mean I stole your money? What are you saying?"
    <br>"I said you stole my money! I saw you! I am going to report you to the man of God!"
    <br>The two of them rushed to my office, and I knew what they were talking about because we started it.
    <br>I said, "Okay, okay, you people should come".
    <br>The gentleman was just coming; immediately his face changed.
    <br>A gentleman that they said he's too gentle, very nice, changed!
    <br>He became wild and said to me, "I swear in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>I said, "No, don't swear! Don't use the name of Jesus to swear.
    <br>But they say you are very quiet; you are very nice".
    <br>"Aaah no, no! I'm nice but I can't just allow somebody to lie against me. This is stupid!
    <br>You lady - you are an idiot!"
    <br>I said, "Can you see someone you said is very quiet and gentle?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I said to them, "Look, there's nothing like you have stolen money.
    <br>Everyone says that you are very quiet and gentle and you are a 'messiah' and I said to them
    <br>they should pose a challenge to you and see whether you remain a 'messiah'.
    <br>Can you see now you are not gentle? You are pretending!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Challenges determine where you are spiritually, reveal the true condition of a man's heart.
    <br>So let me take you to the book of Hebrews 5.
    <br>I will take my reading from verse 1 and later we can go to the proof text.
    <br>"Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters
    <br>related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
    <br>He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray,
    <br>since he himself is subject to weakness.
    <br>This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people."
    <br>Lets take you to verse 7 and 8.
    <br>"During the days of Jesusâ€™ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears
    <br>to the one who could save him from death, the one who could save him from death
    <br>with crying and what? Tears.
    <br>Jesus was heard because of his reverent submission.
    <br>Verse 8
    <br>Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered."
    <br>Though Jesus was a Son of God, He learned obedience by the things He suffered.
    <br>He went through agony, anguish and physical pain.
    <br>The Bible says "reverent submission".
    <br>That is, He submitted to the revealing Word of God.
    <br>Jesus submitted to the revealing Word of God.
    <br>This means spiritual growth is a function of obedience to the will of God.
    <br>And this will take us to the title: KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THE KEY, OBEDIENCE IS
    <br>In 1 Peter 4:1, Jesus suffered for us in the flesh.
    <br>He suffered for us in the flesh.
    <br>If Jesus suffered for us in the flesh, we should arm ourselves with the same manner,
    <br>the same attitude, the same mind.
    <br>The Bible says, "For he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin".
    <br>He who has suffered from the flesh has ceased from what? (Sin) From sin.
    <br>That is, stopped sinning.
    <br>Jesus learned obedience by the things He suffered.
    <br>We learn obedience by the difficult challenges we face today.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Learn obedience by the difficulty you face today".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Learn obedience by the difficulty you face today.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Learn obedience by the difficulty you face today.]
    <br>What are the difficulties you are facing - those challenges?
    <br>Our situations are tests to mature us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My situations are tests to mature me".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[My situations are tests to mature me.]
    <br>My challenges are tests to mature me.
    <br>What are your challenges? What is your situation?
    <br>That is a question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>What are your challenges? What is your situation as a Christian?
    <br>They are tests to mature you.
    <br>Whatever situations you are facing, don't allow them to control you.
    <br>When your situation controls you, you will lose all sense of reasoning.
    <br>This is what is happening to you today.
    <br>Everyone that is better than you - they are criminals, they are corrupt people, they are thieves.
    <br>When you don't have a vehicle and you are on your way and you see a posh car - they are criminals,
    <br>they are the ones carrying our money!
    <br>Because we have lost sense of what? Reasoning.
    <br>When poverty comes and you allow poverty to control you, hardship to control you,
    <br>those who are better than you in terms of money, wealth - they are your enemy.
    <br>When you allow your depression to control you, those who are happy - they are your enemy.
    <br>When you allow your sickness to control you, those who are not sick - they are your enemy.
    <br>When they laugh, you feel irritated.
    <br>And when you are not sick and you are healthy, if you allow your good health to control you as well,
    <br>those who are sick - you will think as a result of their sin comes sickness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>2 Timothy 3:7 says, we are "always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth".
    <br>Sin easily hides where there is no heat of trial and temptation.
    <br>Where there is no heat of challenges, sin easily hides.
    <br>Just as impurity hides in gold until it goes into processing.
    <br>You know gold.
    <br>The impurity on that gold must be removed before it becomes gold.
    <br>So in the same way, sin, iniquity, easily hides where there is no heat of challenges, trial, temptation, trouble.
    <br>In time of prosperity and success, you will see the evil one rejoicing and rejoicing.
    <br>But when the heat of trials and temptations comes, their evil action surfaces.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No matter how much you master the Scripture...
    <br>The Bible - which many of us are using today as a cover up.
    <br>We hide under the knowledge of the Bible to deceive the world that you are a Christian,
    <br>you are a Bishop, you are a Prophet, you are Archbishop - whatever name you call yourself.
    <br>We are hiding under the knowledge of the Bible.
    <br>And knowledge is not the key; obedience is
    <br>No matter how much you master the Scripture,
    <br>without true obedience to what you read, you still wear spiritual diapers.
    <br>We continue to learn and come to church from far and wide
    <br>to hear this message of God, and many of us live with Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We live with what?
    <br>(Emmanuel TV)
    <br>Yes. That is, as I am talking now, some of us turn it on in our bedroom.
    <br>Our children put it on all the time
    <br>We live with it.
    <br>Yet, we never mature because of disobedience.
    <br>Knowledge is not the key; obedience is.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>We continue learning, coming to church from far and wide, to hear the message of the Gospel,
    <br>yet we never mature because of disobedience.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Maturity is all about Christ.
    <br>When you are not mature, you are ignorant and ignorance is a sin.
    <br>When you are not mature, you react intellectually to the the things of God.
    <br>You react by what you see and you think it is godly way to do that.
    <br>You react by what you hear.
    <br>"Eeeh, eeh, you said this to me!?"
    <br>"You mean? My wife? My wife did this? You saw my wife there?"
    <br>"Yes, I saw your wife there!"
    <br>And you would not know that they want to scatter your marriage!
    <br>It is easy to destroy those who are not mature. If you are not mature, you are just food to satan.
    <br>Any time they see you happy, they will go into a corner and make a phone call to you.
    <br>"This man is happy; let me give him unhappiness!"
    <br>They now will give you phone call.
    <br>"Hello?"
    <br>"Yes, you see, I saw your wife. The place I saw your wife is very, very bad."
    <br>"I am telling you; you know it is bad."
    <br>"Ehn ehn, where?"
    <br>"This place, that place."
    <br>"Aaaah, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."
    <br>You drop the phone and you say,  [Crying] "I loved this woman! I loved her!
    <br>I don't know why she would behave like this to me!" You want to commit suicide.
    <br>Those who have committed suicide - 50% of them -
    <br>they act ignorantly -
    <br>what they hear, what they see, what their circumstances look like.
    <br>So, these are the weapons against immature Christians.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take note of this word. Now take it and work on it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your challenges determine where you are spiritually.
    <br>Your challenges could be sickness, poverty, hardship, insult, temptation - just name them.
    <br>Trials and temptations determine where we are spiritually.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How you react when you are under pressure and how you react when you are under those challenges...
    <br>You will see the way you react is how the real you reacts.
    <br>It's how the real you reacts. Say, "How I react".
    <br>How I react under pressure - I mean, under challenges - I mean, under your problem...
    <br>I don't know the condition you are in - maybe hardship, sickness, debt or hardship.
    <br>How you react is how the real you reacts.
    <br>And the real you is the one serving God, not you.
    <br>You are here today because you have transport to come to the church or you are able to fuel your car.
    <br>Assume, you have no money to fuel your car, you will likely send your children to church and sit at home
    <br>because you do not want to be shamed by people around you.
    <br>You have forgotten that the same God that gave you the vehicle,
    <br>that gave you the car when you were nobody before
    <br>and the Lord now gave you the vehicle - you are now using the same vehicle against Him!
    <br>By looking at the way people dance,  you will know who is this man!
    <br>Whether he is coming to give testimony or he is coming with trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You see some dances; they will do like this.
    <br>While some dance, they will say, "Hallelujah, hallelujah".
    <br>You know that satan has hit him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Trials and temptations determine where you are spiritually.
    <br>How you react under pressure, how you react under your situation, is how the real you reacts.
    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Let me believe today's message blessed your soul. Knowledge is not the key; obedience is.
    <br>You just need to take your time. Meditate on it.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>My dear viewers, let us pray.
    <br>Whatever medium you are using to view us, Jesus knows.
    <br>Dear viewers all over the world, the devil wants us to curse Jesus while under our situation.
    <br>The devil wants us to curse Jesus while under pain, affliction, poverty.
    <br>Our situations are tests to mature us.
    <br>Don't allow any situation to control you.
    <br>Don't allow any situation to mislead you or overwhelm you.
    <br>Stay and cope with hard and good moments.
    <br>Viewers, listen. Stay and cope with hard and good moments.
    <br>A person can be sick in body and yet be a Christian, a friend of God, and a favorite of Jesus.
    <br>Don't measure your Christian life by your situation.
    <br>Don't allow your situation to mislead you.
    <br>I want to pray with you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever situation you are in, in the name of Jesus, I release you!
    <br>Be released in the name of Jesus!

    <br>Whatever situation you are going through in your life, be released in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You situation, I say, "Go! Leave my people, leave their business, leave their career, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>I can see you being released.
    <br>Where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>I can hear breakthrough! Breakthrough in your way, health, career, destiny!
    <br>Breakthrough, breakthrough, breakthrough, breakthrough, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Jesus, for their breakthrough.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for their breakthrough, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I will know before you that you are free.
    <br>I say to you, you are free in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being set free.
    <br>Whatever situation in your health, any area of your organs that is not functioning,
    <br>be it your kidneys, liver, blood, fluid, or bones, be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be restored in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are restored!
    <br>I can see you being restored!
    <br>It's a vision - I can see you being restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Those of you that are under the influence of my voice,
    <br>you believe Jesus is Lord, Healer, Deliverer, Saviour.
    <br>I say to you, this is your testimony - testimony of your health!
    <br>This is your testimony - testimony of your finances!
    <br>This is your testimony - testimony of your breakthrough!
    <br>This is your testimony - testimony of your restoration!
    <br>Yes, I can hear breakthrough once again.
    <br>Breakthrough! Breakthrough! Breakthrough! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I rejoice with you, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen! Amen! Amen!
