    <br>Viewers all over the world, it is time for another dimension in prayer.
    <br>God wants me to sit and God wants me to stand.
    <br>This is another dimension in prayer.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I understand that many people are in pain and in difficulty, are afflicted by virus - COVID-19.
    <br>You killer disease, whatever affliction, whatever virus, hear this announcement:
    <br>They are not your candidates. Leave my people, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>They are not your candidates. Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever affliction - leave my people, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Leave their system, leave their organs, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>They are sick in body;
    <br>they are in pain.
    <br>Whatever strange pain in their system, in their organs - cease, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I speak Your name: Jesus!
    <br>Oh Jesus, touch their bodies with good health!
    <br>Touch their bodies with Your healing power!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, I pray!
    <br>Divine health is your portion, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Divine health is your portion, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Divine health is your portion, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Whatever strange pain in your system, in your organs, in your faculties - cease, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Every obstacle holding you down - I loose you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I free you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being free!
    <br>I can see you being free, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>I can see you being restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see you being restored, being free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>By the mercy of God, I can see you free from the prison of failure!
    <br>I can see you free from the prison of deadly disease, killer disease, COVID-19!
    <br>I can see you free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>By the mercy of God, I can see you free from the prison of stagnation,
    <br>from the prison of career failure, from the prison of setback,
    <br>from the prison of failure at the edge of success.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Viewers, this is a new day for you and you shall sing a new song, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>You shall sing a new song, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Right now, begin to walk into your breakthrough -
    <br>career breakthrough, business breakthrough.
    <br>Begin to walk into your breakthrough!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough - 
    <br>financial breakthrough, good health breakthrough.
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Those who had written you off shall come for your help, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
