  <p>    
    <br>Prayer Time
    <br>Viewers all around the world, get ready to release your career, your destiny and restore your health
    <br>as every demonic authority over your life is broken
    <br>as you pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua, in Jesus' name.
    <br>God's power is so real, authentic and forceful.
    <br>It cannot be limited by space or time.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>I know you have been waiting to receive this blessing, hear the good news.
    <br>Right now, begin to break every demonic influence, demonic being
    <br>over your business, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>over your health, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Begin to break it, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Whatever name they call your sickness,
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot heal, never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Begin to break that demonic influence, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Break it, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Demonic authority over your business, over your health,
    <br>begin to break it, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I join you right now to break it.
    <br>I break it, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see your health being restored.
    <br>Right now, rise up and exercise yourself.
    <br>What you have not been doing in the past, begin to do it right now, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I talk to your business - whatever demonic influence over your business,
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see your business being released, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see your finances being released, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your life, your destiny, career are being released, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ! In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen.
