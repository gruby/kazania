  <p>    
    <br>I will take this my message from the Book of John 15, verse 11.
    <br>John 15, verse 11.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>“I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.”
    <br>It means without God’s joy, we don’t have joy.
    <br>So, what is not done right is not done at all.
    <br>When something is not complete, it is nothing.
    <br>It is not right.
    <br>The joy of God makes our joy what?
    <br>(Complete.)
    <br>... makes our joy complete.
    <br>This is what the Bible says here.
    <br>“I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.”
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>So, it means without God’s joy, we have no joy.
    <br>What is not done well is not done at all.
    <br>Don't forget the Book of John 16:33.
    <br>“These things I speak to you, in Me, you may have peace.”
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>And this John 15:11 - it is telling us that without God's joy, we have no joy.
    <br>This means peace is synonymous to joy.
    <br>Peace is synonymous - that is, another word for peace is joy.
    <br>It is a fruit of faith – joy!
    <br>It is a fruit of what?
    <br>It is a fruit - like a mango on a tree.
    <br>You have a fruit on the top - the tree is faith.
    <br>Mango on top of... - joy, peace, love.
    <br>It is a fruit of faith.
    <br>It is a fruit that comes from the recreated spirit – love, peace, joy.
    <br>It means, without faith, no joy.
    <br>Faith is the tree that carries that.
    <br>This is why joy is something that only believers have; no other people.
    <br>If you are not a believer, you are without joy.
    <br>Joy is something that only believers have.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "If you are not a believer, you have no joy."
    <br>If you are not a believer, you have no joy.
    <br>It’s not something you can manufacture or create by yourself.
    <br>You think, "I need joy, I need joy."
    <br>Money - millions of dollars cannot give you that joy.
    <br>The world may have happiness – they find that in their environment and in their surroundings.
    <br>The world, those who are not believers - they may have happiness.
    <br>Happiness, when they give you a million dollars you say, "Oh! Happiness has come!"
    <br>You begin to say, "Hey!" But not joy!
    <br>One day you receive a phone call from the president,
    <br>"Hey! They want to see you in the White House!" or whatever.
    <br>"Oh!" - that is happiness; it is not joy.
    <br>The world may have happiness – they find that in their environment and in their surroundings.
    <br>That is the world.
    <br>But joy is something only believers have.
    <br>Are you a believer?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>(Yes!)
    <br>Are you a believer?
    <br>(Yes.)
    <br>You understand what I am saying.
    <br>That shows that joy is our conquering power.
    <br>Let someone say, “conquering power”.
    <br>(Conquering power.)
    <br>If you don’t have joy, no power - conquering power
    <br>Power to overcome sickness is joy.
    <br>Power to overcome hardship is joy.
    <br>Power to overcome isolation is joy.
    <br>Power to overcome affliction is joy.
    <br>If you don’t have joy, you cannot overcome this.
    <br>The Bible says, "All this will happen but cheer up, I have overcome."
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Conquering power.
    <br>Take note; whenever our joy seeps out and leaves us barren and empty,
    <br>it proves that we are out of fellowship, out of contact with God.
    <br>Anytime you notice that there is no joy - out of God.
    <br>You cannot pray - even when you are praying, you are not there.

    <br>Whenever our joy seeps out,
    <br>it proves that we are out of fellowship, out of contact with God.
    <br>Whenever you find no joy - no fellowship, no joy - no contact with God.
    <br>I have joy - this is why you see me.
    <br>Say, "Joy is my conquering power".
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Conquering power.
    <br>When you have joy, you will overcome affliction.
    <br>You have affliction but you tell people, "With God all things are possible".
    <br>You will be laughing, you see people laughing and happy, whereas they have...
    <br>Look at Apostle Paul with a thorn in his flesh - go and read it in Corinthians.
    <br>The Bible did not tell us exactly the affliction he had, but we know it was an affliction from the pit of hell.

    <br>As a Christian, trials may test you; they cannot destroy or rob your joy.
    <br>When you are not a believer, trials will destroy you,
    <br>will overthrow you from your position,
    <br>will take you out of God.
    <br>It is trial and affliction that cause all this today.
    <br>Many of us want to reestablish our relationship with God.
    <br>You keep going out, out, going out, out, going out because of trouble.
    <br>When you have trouble, you begin to say, "Why do I have this trouble?".
    <br>And you don't know that satan uses this to rob you of your joy,
    <br>to rob you of your relationship.
    <br>Temptation, affliction, poverty, hardship may test you as a man of faith;
    <br>they cannot destroy you because of joy.
    <br>(Amen.)
