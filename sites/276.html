  <p>    
    <br>We have to say one or two things about what happened today.
    <br>Let me just look at the case of a woman who was delivered and the husband came out.
    <br>Let me see that woman.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>Look at what happened today to her.
    <br>I know that you were the one who was delivered and your husband came out.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Can I see that video, let's just learn some lessons.
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Don't do that.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I beg, don't do that to me. Leave me.
    <br>Leave me alone.
    <br>What are you doing inside this body?
    <br>I am her friend. I love her.
    <br>How long have you been living inside her?
    <br>Since her secondary school days.
    <br>We were friends in the school. 
    <br>We ate together.
    <br>Her husband will not love her.
    <br>I made her husband hate her.
    <br>He hates her.
    <br>He threw her out of the house for six months now with the child.
    <br>I love her.
    <br>I don't want her to marry.
    <br>- Where is the husband?
    <br>- The husband hates her. He even came here.
    <br>He hates her, he doesn't want to see her.
    <br>Just leave me.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>- Who am I?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- What are you doing here?
    <br>- I don't know.
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Out!
    <br>- Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>- Man of God, no!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>You are going.
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>I gave her a hot temper.
    <br>Now, she is planning to commit suicide.
    <br>- Why?
    <br>- I want her dead.
    <br>She will commit suicide.
    <br>She is planning to commit suicide; she will kill herself.
    <br>I will kill her husband because he hates her.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, fire all over your body right now!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord. You are free.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>She is my wife, I drove her out of my house since November.
    <br>She has been too stubborn.
    <br>I have suffered in her hand.
    <br>She destabilized my completely.
    <br>She frustrated all my dreams and future, even for my son.
    <br>I was even surprised that I met her here.
    <br>Since she saw me here, she never greeted me.
    <br>We never talked to each other.
    <br>She was on her own; I was on my own.
    <br>I came with my friends.
    <br>I sent her away since November and gave her the divorce letter
    <br>and instructed her not to be coming to my house.
    <br>She has been going to my friends,
    <br>crying and telling them that I should please bring her back.
    <br>I then told my friend to tell her that except if she comes here for deliverance,
    <br>apart from that, I will not be under the same roof with her.
    <br>She has threatened to kill me.
    <br>When I was a counsellor, there was nothing I did not do for her.
    <br>She is a nurse.
    <br>I made my brothers to secure a job for her in Europe.
    <br>When they did, I processed all her papers here in Nigeria.
    <br>She was having her international passport and it expired in her hand.
    <br>The dream was that I sent my son to school abroad.
    <br>She just killed that dream.
    <br>All the money that I spent, everything that I spent on that plan just went down the drain.
    <br>Not only that I opened business for her.
    <br>She is working in primary health care
    <br>but not only that I had given her business, everything scattered.
    <br>We are not fighting against flesh and blood but against the devilish kingdom.
    <br>Let's hear from madam.
    <br>How are you now?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>- You said you wanted to destroy her.
    <br>- Myself?
    <br>Yes and you made her husband send her out of the house.
    <br>No, I love myself so much, I cannot destroy myself.
    <br>Sir, this is to tell you that whatever she might have done, she was not the one that did it.
    <br>It was the evil spirit in her that did it.
    <br>Don't worry, when you meet with my master, he will tell you God's opinion about the marriage.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You for healing me!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Let's call my father out please
    <br>because this is a great thing, he has given the divorce letter already.
    <br>What does Jesus have to say about this?
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>Sir, come here please.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>I really want to salute you for coming here
    <br>because after seeing a woman you don't want to see,
    <br>"This is the woman I don't want to see; I don't want to meet anywhere!"
    <br>She is here and you are still waiting.
    <br>I salute your faith.
    <br>Man of God, help me beg my husband to forgive me.
    <br>Please, let me talk.
    <br>Let us hear God's opinion.
    <br>In every situation, sir, God has something to say.
    <br>This situation is messed up.
    <br>One, because the divorce letter has been served.
    <br>It means - sack!
    <br>Help me Man of God, beg my husband to forgive me in Jesus' name.
    <br>Wait.
    <br>When you left home, when you were given a divorce letter,
    <br>a new wife has been ushered in.
    <br>Now the wife is with him and they want to do traditional wedding.
    <br>- Don't you?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Can you see now?
    <br>Now, what does God say about this?
    <br>I think the new woman is here.
    <br>Yes, sir, she is here.
    <br>OK, let her come.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>The reason is that I want to join this family.
    <br>What a wonderful woman.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>I want to escort my sister.
    <br>Give me your hand; I am your brother.
    <br>Please, let's go.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>My sister, the reason I called you out is because you are part of the body.
    <br>You are part of us here, that is why I called you out.
    <br>I see your decency; that is why I called you.
    <br>If I don't see who you are, I would not bother to call you.
    <br>I would just say, "You don't need to call her."
    <br>But because I am your brother...
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>My sister never knew that all this had happened.
    <br>What a wonderful woman.
    <br>She never knew that all this had happened.
    <br>We are calling this meeting,
    <br>we want to know what does God say about this matter.
    <br>In every situation, God has something to say.
    <br>Sir,
    <br>this our sister...
    <br>I want to really salute you for what you had gone through in the hands of this my sister
    <br>because God is with you.
    <br>If not, the situation today would not look like this.
    <br>You have triumphed today.
    <br>This is victory for you - victory for you, your God.
    <br>Victory.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>You never anyway intended to go into a polygamous home or marry and remarry.
    <br>Yes, Man of God. You are right.
    <br>You never thought of it, you never prayed for that, never, ever...
    <br>But we now see the situation at hand - a woman behaving like this, that.
    <br>You are seeing in your vision, your dreams all the time - an attack.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>A pastor told you about this woman.
    <br>Yes, Man of God. You are right.
    <br>- He told you that she was possessed.
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>And there were two pastors.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>About two pastors have told me.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>Even herself.
    <br>The stories she told me about herself, proved to me that she was possessed.
    <br>Now...
    <br>You know you said a word when friends were persuading you,
    <br>were telling you, you said a word.
    <br>"If this woman could go to The SCOAN and be delivered, I would talk, if not, I cannot talk."
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>I know what you want to say if the woman eventually comes to The SCOAN.
    <br>Now, she is in The SCOAN and I know what you want to say.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>Now, back to my sister.
    <br>What we are doing is for the glory of God
    <br>and whatever the outcome is of this judgment,
    <br>I will join you in your wedding.
    <br>On the day of that wedding, I will be there.
    <br>I will join you, whatever the outcome of God's judgment.
    <br>So please, there is nothing to cry about - you should thank God.
    <br>- You were also delivered here.
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>- Do you remember your confession?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Can you play the confession - let me see.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>- Who are you?
    <br>- I am her husband.
    <br>- For how long have you been in her?
    <br>- Since 2009.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>I have paid her bride price.
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>I gave her waist pain.
    <br>I want to remove her womb.
    <br>Leave me!
    <br>What other evil have you done to her?
    <br>I destroyed her family.
    <br>I don't want them to get married.
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>Now, out of her!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire all over your body!
    <br>In your stomach - fire!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Can you see now, sir?
    <br>This is exactly what you were supposed to have done
    <br>before you got married to this woman.
    <br>Who is to be blamed?
    <br>It is you.
    <br>Remember, sir, you said she confessed to you that she was possessed.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Actually, what happened was that I made a mistake.
    <br>That is what I am saying.
    <br>I had an encounter with ladies that kept me off;
    <br>I avoided women for quite a long time.
    <br>I made a decision that any woman that came across me, I would marry her.
    <br>That time, my eyes had not yet opened; I didn't even know this place.
    <br>As soon as I met with her, I told her that I would get married to her.
    <br>I married with her.
    <br>I did not involve God to tell you the truth.
    <br>I am coming, sir; I am still saying the same thing.
    <br>Sir, what is going to happen now -  God wants you to settle down.
    <br>Now, let me give you what God says.
    <br>If you finally decide to marry this woman, you will not stop at this woman.
    <br>I am seeing another woman again after this woman.
    <br>That will not be her fault but from you.
    <br>If you finally settle down with this woman,
    <br>this woman will not be the last; another one is coming.
    <br>Something will happen and she will leave.
    <br>I can tell you what will happen.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>Now...
    <br>Now, this woman is delivered.
    <br>I am not appealing, I am just telling you the mind of God.
    <br>Now, she is delivered
    <br>and if you finally decide, "OK, let me settle down with this one,"
    <br>you will not go over any woman.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>Satan just wants to begin to use some things to destroy your home.
    <br>You are looking for a way to settle down
    <br>whereas satan is trying to use this to drag you and to destroy your wealth and home.
    <br>I am seeing your settling down with a fourth woman,
    <br>if you go with this madam.
    <br>But here, it will be the final.
    <br>My madam is not the cause of your broken homes in the future.
    <br>Rather, it will come because it is a family curse.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>So, now...
    <br>This woman here, many things she knows about you,
    <br>in terms of your strength and weakness.
    <br>God has prepared her to bear it.
    <br>Some of your weaknesses, she knows and some of your strengths, she knows.
    <br>There are some that she did not even know
    <br>and she will not be able to bear it when she discovers it and that will break the home.
    <br>Try to understand.
    <br>She is aware of many of your strengths and many of your weaknesses,
    <br>and she is ready to continue the journey, no matter what.
    <br>But my sister here is aware of some of your weaknesses and some of your strengths.
    <br>But there are certain strengths and weaknesses
    <br>she is going to discover in the nearest future
    <br>and she will not be able to bear and it's not her fault
    <br>because it is the generation we are in.
    <br>I want to pray with my sister here and I will join forces with her,
    <br>and she is going to settle down, but not with you, sir.
    <br>She is going to settle down and you also will be happy seeing her settle down.
    <br>She is going to settle down with someone that God will give her.
    <br>And we want to thank you for your journey so far and my sister,
    <br>there is nothing to cry or to think about, rather, this is the voice of God.
    <br>I want you to be happy.
    <br>I want to join your family and to make sure that this home is built.
    <br>She is your mother now, you can say go and bring that plate and she will bring it.
    <br>God has prepared her to that extent that today, she is everything.
    <br>The divorce and your family issue, I am going to join you and that is between me and you.
    <br>We are going to discuss that.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>I know that you don't want to step on your family,
    <br>the issue of your family and many other people that stood to support you concerning this divorce.
    <br>How are you going to explain yourself to them?
    <br>Don't worry. With God all things are possible
    <br>and I want to assure you that this woman you are seeing, this deliverance that took place,
    <br>you will come here and give thanks to God.
    <br>While my sister too, is coming here in a big way.
    <br>So, please my sister, please.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>I want to meet you - he will be the first person I will meet.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself is: what is happening here?
    <br>Why should God bring different issues like this?
    <br>I didn't invite them; I am meeting all of them here for the first time.
    <br>At the same time God brought them here and they met in the morning
    <br>and the woman was supposed to go but she still remained
    <br>and stayed to hear their weaknesses.
    <br>You know, ordinarily, you would not want something to be...
    <br>Even if it is a good thing you want to say; you can't say what will happen when they touch you.
    <br>Once you see somebody you don't want to see, you want to leave and say you would come next time.
    <br>But this is God for you.
    <br>While the message was going on, almost two people called
    <br>that this woman that was talking here,
    <br>they have been fasting and praying for a dear wife.
    <br>Read what is there.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>We just received a call on one of our prayer lines from a man in Jos, Plateu State.
    <br>He said his name is Mr. Obinna; that he would like to ask if it is possible
    <br>to arrange a meeting with the woman in green native dress
    <br>because he will love to marry her.
    <br>This is another one.
    <br>We just received another phone call on another of our prayer lines from a man; his name is Tunde.
    <br>He is in Lagos here and he said he is already on his way to the church, to meet the woman.
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>By tomorrow, we are expecting nothing less than fifty people!
    <br>So fifty people when they come like this, we will...
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>The fifty people, we will pray for them and after praying for them
    <br>we will now ask them, "What are you talking about?
    <br>Have you prepared for marriage?"
    <br>Marital Problems? DIVORCE Is NOT The Answer!!!
    <br>Sir, the phones are ringing constantly for the sister in green native dress.
    <br>We received another phone call from an Honourable in Akwa Ibom State.
    <br>He is the Assistant Speaker in the House of Assembly.
    <br>He wants to marry her.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
