    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Here I am
    <br>Humbled by Your majesty
    <br>Covered by Your grace so free
    <br>Here I am
    <br>Knowing I'm a sinful man
    <br>Covered by the blood of the Lamb
    <br>And now I've found
    <br>The greatest love of all is mine
    <br>Since You laid down Your life
    <br>The greatest sacrifice
    <br>Majesty
    <br>Your grace has found me just as I am
    <br>Empty handed but alive in Your hands
    <br>Here I am
    <br>Humbled by Your majesty
    <br>Covered by Your grace so free
    <br>Here I stand
    <br>Knowing I'm a sinful man
    <br>Covered by the blood of the Lamb
    <br>And now I've found
    <br>That the greatest love of all is mine
    <br>Since You laid down Your life
    <br>The greatest sacrifice
    <br>Majesty
    <br>Your grace has found me just as I am

    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is the General Overseer of The SCOAN.
    <br>T.B. Joshua himself says that the Founder is Jesus Christ.
    <br>He is just one who has submitted himself humbly to the will of God.
    <br>He was born on June 12, 1963 in Ondo State, Nigeria.
    <br>The journey of T.B. Joshua is a history of how God raised up a humble man to be the director of an international ministry.
    <br>This ministry attracts people from all over the world just to see the reality of the power of God.
    <br>From dropping out of secondary school in his first year
    <br>to working in a poultry farm; from teaching little children while attending evening classes
    <br>to washing people's legs on the muddy streets of Lagos;
    <br>from a forty day fast to receiving a divine call
    <br>and starting a ministry with mere eight members -
    <br>the life of T.B. Joshua is a story of amazing grace and unwavering focus.
    <br>Today, he is a mentor to presidents yet a friend to the widows and less privileged,
    <br>a role model to his generation
    <br>yet T.B. Joshua is a humble and hardworking man,
    <br>toiling tirelessly for the advancement of God's kingdom.
    <br>His story is an encouragement that there is hope for the weak.
    <br>For us, as a Church in the city of Cali,
    <br>it is a privilege and honour to introduce Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>for the first time in Colombia and in the entire Western hemisphere.
    <br>A big round of applause to our God
    <br>for His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Welcome! We love you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Buenos dias, Colombia!
    <br>(Good morning, Colombia!)
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Let me first start by saluting people of faith.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Our fathers in the Lord,
    <br>our mothers in the Lord,
    <br>I salute your faith.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>The government and government officials,
    <br>the kings and queens
    <br>and all those who have made this occasion possible
    <br>in one way or the other, I salute you, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Since I came to Colombia, what I have seen among the people of Colombia,
    <br>the nation of Colombia, is quite opposite to what we hear outside.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>People of Colombia, the nation of Colombia, they are beautiful, wonderful people.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>I took my time to move around and they are wonderful people -
    <br>quite different from the impression outside there.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Every nation, every country has its own challenges.
    <br>Challenges make us stronger.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Challenges are part and parcel of our greatness.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>We learn more in challenges than comfort.
    <br>Whatever challenges the nation of Colombia is facing, God is aware.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Once again, those of us who actually came from other countries and nations,
    <br>I want you to take your time after the revival, if you have not moved
    <br>round Colombia to see the environment, the nation and the people of Colombia,
    <br>your mission here is not complete.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>You have to move round and see what I have seen so that you will go back to
    <br>your country and tell the world, Colombia is a different nation
    <br>compared to what we have heard about Colombia.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Once again, I salute our fathers and mothers in the Lord; I salute your faith.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You are welcome, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>When I was coming, I had a message which I want to deliver.
    <br>The title:
    <br>THE PRICE OF FAITH
    <br>Let us ask ourselves a fundamental question.
    <br>That is the reason for this meeting.
    <br>The question: What is the Bible - the one you are holding?
    <br>Ask yourself what is the Bible.
    <br>We have forgotten the foundation, that is why Christianity today is facing challenges.
    <br>What is the Bible - the one you are holding?
    <br>We don't know the difference between the Bible and other books.
    <br>The Bible is the greatest book on earth.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>It is the Book of books; it is the Word of God,
    <br>the God who created the Heavens and the earth, the Head of the invisible world,
    <br>material and immaterial.
    <br>It is God's Word which is our standard of living as Christians.
    <br>If you are a Christian, this is our standard of living.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>There is nothing we shall say here, in this meeting, that will be outside of the Bible.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>There is nothing we shall say here, in this meeting, that will be outside of the Bible.
    <br>It is our roadmap.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>When you are lost, this is your roadmap.
    <br>When you are lonely, it is a friend closer than a brother.
    <br>Here - healing.
    <br>Here - blessing.
    <br>Here - salvation.
    <br>Here - you.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Let us look at the Book of 2 Peter.
    <br>Open with me, the New Testament, after the Book of 1 Peter, 2 Peter 1.
    <br>I will take my proof reading from verse 21,
    <br>but let's take reading from verse 1.
    <br>"Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,
    <br>To those who through the righteousness of our God and Saviour
    <br>Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours:
    <br>Grace and peace be yours in abundance
    <br>through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord."
    <br>Let's go to the proof text.
    <br>Verse 20.
    <br>"Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about
    <br>by the prophet's own interpretation of things.
    <br>For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man,
    <br>but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."
    <br>Here, a question.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>How did the Bible come into being?
    <br>Here, a question.
    <br>How did the Bible come into being - the one you have with you?
    <br>It is not like any other book.
    <br>How did it come into being?
    <br>Holy men wrote the Bible.
    <br>As it is written here, men were carried along by the Holy Spirit
    <br>as they spoke the message that came from God.
    <br>If men were carried along by the Holy Spirit,
    <br>we must also be carried along to read.
    <br>We must be carried along by the Holy Spirit to read it
    <br>because when we read the Bible, we are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When you read literature like Chemistry or Physics, you are reading about events
    <br>but here, when you read, you are reading about the Holy Spirit.
    <br>To read this Book, you must be carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>To preach it, you must be carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>To teach it, you must be carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Are we carried along today?
    <br>Are we carried along by the Holy Spirit?
    <br>That is the challenge we have.
    <br>When we are not carried along by the Holy Spirit, our effort will be idle,
    <br>meaningless and oftentimes, destructive.
    <br>That is, oftentimes challenging when we are not carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In the Book of Mark, as it is written, which we shall go into tomorrow...
    <br>But let's talk about Galatians 5:16 - walk by the Spirit.
    <br>Or you talk about the Book of Colossians 1:9;
    <br>It tells us that when we read this Bible by the Holy Spirit,
    <br>we have exact knowledge, perfect knowledge and complete knowledge.
    <br>That knowledge is in the Word when it is illumined by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>That is, when the Holy Spirit gives light to the Word.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit, the Word is without action.
    <br>The Word will remain idle and inactive without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In the Book of John 6:63, God always works through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>Both His Word and Spirit are paramount, that is important, to bring about His will.
    <br>His Word speaks about His promises; His Spirit executes it, carries it out.
    <br>Again.
    <br>His Word speaks about His promises while His Spirit executes it, carries it out.
    <br>His Word speaks about His promises while His Spirit executes it.
    <br>One is not complete without the other.
    <br>The Word is not complete without the Spirit.
    <br>The Spirit is not complete without His Word.
    <br>Without the Spirit, the Word remains idle.
    <br>When I say, "Be healed" without the Spirit, it is empty talk.
    <br>If I say, "Be delivered" without the Spirit, the Word will remain idle,
    <br>meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>The words 'oftentimes destructive' mean, if I cannot deliver you, you will deliver me.
    <br>This is what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>When you speak words without the Spirit, your words will remain idle.
    <br>This is what happens in the ministry today.
    <br>The challenge we are facing is harmony between the Spirit and the Word.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>Harmony between the Word and the Spirit.
    <br>Harmony.
    <br>It is Biblically incorrect to speak about the two in separation,
    <br>that is Word and Spirit in separation.
    <br>Saying, "Be healed" without the Spirit is dangerous, a dangerous mission.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>The title:
    <br>THE PRICE OF FAITH
    <br>You can take the reading from Acts 19,
    <br>"While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior
    <br>and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples."
    <br>These kinds of disciples they are talking about are many in the ministry today.
    <br>We say we are Christians, whereas we are religious people.
    <br>Listen to what the Bible says.
    <br>"There he found some disciples
    <br>and asked them, 'Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?' "
    <br>That is the question: Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?
    <br>Of what value is He to you, if you have received Him?
    <br>If you say yes, you have received the Holy Spirit, of what value is He to you?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>It is plainly clear that the Word and the Spirit are not getting along as they should in the church today.
    <br>I take it back again.
    <br>It is plainly clear that the Word and the Spirit are not getting along
    <br>that is, there is no union as there should be in the church today.
    <br>Churches are known for one or the other.
    <br>It is either this church for the preaching, teaching of the Word
    <br>or the other one for miracles, signs and wonders.
    <br>This is not the right Scripture.
    <br>This is not the way it should be.
    <br>This church is known for miracles, signs and wonders.
    <br>This church is known to be preaching, teaching the Word.
    <br>The future of the church depends on our learning from each other.
    <br>I need your power; you need my theology.
    <br>I need your theology; you need my power.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Once again.
    <br>The way out.
    <br>The future of the church depends on our learning from each other.
    <br>I am because you are; you are because I am.
    <br>Where I am weak, you are strong; where you are strong, I am weak.
    <br>I need your power; you need my theology.
    <br>I need your theology; you need my power.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>I'm personally looking forward to the day when we will no longer envy,
    <br>fight and be jealous of one another.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>The cause of jealousy, envy and fights, this church fighting this church
    <br>is because this church is a miracle worker and this one preaches the Gospel.
    <br>The cause of the fighting is what this one has, this does not have.
    <br>What this one has, this one does not have; this is the cause of the fighting.

    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua â€“ Day 1
    <br>Every true Christian is looking to the great move of God.
    <br>Thank you.
