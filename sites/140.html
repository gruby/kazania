  <p>    
    <br>As Wise Man Christopher moved to the overflow congregation at The SCOAN,
    <br>the power of God was present to heal, to deliver, and bless them.
    <br>Prayerfully touching her in the name of Jesus Christ, the power of the Holy Ghost uncovered the darkness
    <br>locking within this woman's life, and the supernatural power of God began to crush
    <br>every demonic stronghold in her life.
    <br>Let's watch and see her deliverance.
    <br>All over your body - fire!
    <br>Now speak out - who are you?
    <br>She is my wife and you know it.
    <br>Why are trying to break a home?
    <br>Are you trying to separate me from my wife?
    <br>When I married her, you were not there.
    <br>You never made vows. Who are you to come between two married people?
    <br>How many of you are living in her?
    <br>We are five.
    <br>Mention your names.
    <br>Frustration, unemployment, death.
    <br>Who is the last person?
    <br>She is a deceiver.
    <br>Who made her to be deceiving?
    <br>Me; she is my wife.
    <br>How does she deceive?
    <br>She is a schemer. She cheats on me and covers her track.
    <br>Now, I’m dealing with her and in a matter of time, she is going to die.
    <br>Her life is in my hands and nobody, neither you or whoever, will take her away from me.
    <br>What is your position in the place you are living?
    <br>I am destroying lives.
    <br>You destroy lives?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How do you go about destroying lives? How?
    <br>Accidents; I break homes.
    <br>How do you break homes?
    <br>I hook her up with married men.
    <br>You hook her up with married men?
    <br>Yes. All married men like her and you know it.
    <br>All married men do what?
    <br>How does she capture married men?
    <br>She has beautiful eyes.
    <br>Bedroom eyes.
    <br>What do you mean by that?
    <br>Can’t you see? Look at her; that is what I am talking about.
    <br>What is in her eyes?
    <br>Power.
    <br>What kind of power?
    <br>That attracts men.
    <br>OK, let’s talk man to man. Leave my wife alone and I will leave you alone.
    <br>How does she use the power in her eyes?
    <br>It attracts men, OK?
    <br>Use it the way you use it to attract men.
    <br>Can’t you see? Oh no, did you drug me?
    <br>When they look at her eyes - what happens to them?
    <br>You will start falling for her, hate your own wife and see her as an ugly beast.
    <br>They will hate their own wives?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>And they will come after this lady?
    <br>Yes, because she betrayed me and I have been punishing her and she doesn't get it.
    <br>That is why I take her to bars, clubs and beat her up.
    <br>She is always bruised as you can see.
    <br>I make her drunk and I beat her; I sleep with her and when the father of her baby comes,
    <br>he finds disaster and I like when they fight.
    <br>You know what? Her future is in my hands; she will never get employment.
    <br>That stupid hair salon she just opened, she will never find business.
    <br>She is always running at a loss until the 10th of July, when she’ll leave this world.
    <br>She will die on the 10th of July. Do you know that?
    <br>Why?
    <br>Last year, she escaped from me when I caused her that fatal accident.
    <br>She survived by a slim chance but this time around, I will not let her escape.
    <br>I am taking her to the dark side.
    <br>How do you want to go about that on the 10th of July?
    <br>Every year in July, I cause accidents, so that she would die and we would drink her blood
    <br>for powers for me and my friends.
    <br>You said that you capture men with the power in your eyes.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How many of them do you normally capture in a day?
    <br>In a day, just three; it depends.
    <br>But every single day, men fall for her, no matter what.
    <br>Where do they normally take her to?
    <br>You know what - it just depends, but what I know is that they will keep following her, calling her,
    <br>leaving messages in the sent items and they will fight with their wives at the end of the day.
    <br>Answer me - how many men do you capture in a day with the power in your eyes?
    <br>It depends but mostly in the clubs.
    <br>You made her to be going to the clubs?
    <br>She goes – can’t you see? She smokes, drinks and can dance.
    <br>I did not know she was coming here. I did not know how it happened
    <br>all the way from Botswana to Nigeria.
    <br>What is in The SCOAN that you hate?
    <br>She came here to see T.B. Joshua; she thinks he is the end of her problems.
    <br>What is in Prophet T.B. Joshua that is against you?
    <br>We live in two different worlds – he lives in the light, we live in the dark.
    <br>What do you do to those married men, their marriages, to their wives?
    <br>Hurting them makes me feel much better.
    <br>They fall for her and don’t love their wives anymore.
    <br>They want divorce and marry her because she is a queen.
    <br>How many have divorced because of you?
    <br>Two or three and others are still fighting as she speaks.
    <br>Leave my wife alone, I want to go before I fight you man to man.
    <br>I have been patient with you, so now take your thing.
    <br>She thinks she is clever but I am more clever than her.
    <br>So right now your end has come.
    <br>Fire in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am fine, sir. How are you?
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>You are delivered. Follow Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for delivering me!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Victoria. I am from Botswana.
    <br>You are very welcome. Can you first tell us what the problems were that brought you to The SCOAN?
    <br>Spiritual husband, excessive drinking and smoking.
    <br>OK. We want to go from the very beginning. How did this problem start in your life?
    <br>At what age did you begin to have these experiences?
    <br>It started when I was a young girl in grade four.
    <br>Men would visit me in my dreams and sleep with me.
    <br>That was in your dreams?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK. As you grew older, what did these evil spirits begin to push you to do in terms of your lifestyle.
    <br>They pushed me to do bad things such as sleeping around with married men,
    <br>having lustful relationships with them and breaking their homes.
    <br>We would go out to night clubs and they would buy me many drinks.
    <br>They would buy me clothes and give me money to sleep with them.
    <br>At the end of the day, they would go back home and I would just collect money from them
    <br>and go where I had to be.
    <br>You would meet these married men in clubs and they would then begin to buy you things.
    <br>What would happen in your relationship with them?
    <br>The only relationship I had with them was just to mingle around.
    <br>During their spare time, they would call me when they were free from their homes.
    <br>They would try to excuse themselves to come and see me.
    <br>Sometimes, I would see them as they were doing other household duties.
    <br>What would happen to these men in terms of the relationships with their wives,
    <br>once they got in contact with you, began the relationship with you.
    <br>What would happen to them with their wives?
    <br>They would fight and quarrel to the extent that their wives would start calling and insulting me
    <br>and I would do the same.
    <br>At the end of the day, the men would protect me.
    <br>The men you met would begin to love you even more than their wives?
    <br>Yes, they would start falling for me instead of their wives.
    <br>Whenever they were away from me, they would start calling me, begging for spare time.
    <br>What other things were you collecting from these married men?
    <br>What would be the things you would be taking from them?
    <br>I would be collecting money, clothes and other gifts.
    <br>Aside from the issue of going around and sleeping with married men,
    <br>what other things did this spirit push you to do in the area of men?
    <br>How would you break men's homes and hearts?
    <br>I was a heart-breaker because I would date someone my age
    <br>but when they were ready to settle down, I wouldn’t settle down with them.
    <br>I would tell them that I wouldn’t settle down for less.
    <br>Even if somebody cried out loud or went to my family for reconciliation, I would not listen to them.
    <br>I would just tell them that I had made up my mind and I had nothing to do with them,
    <br>and that's the way it is.
    <br>How did you feel each time you broke a man's heart?
    <br>Every time they cried or said it, I would just laugh.
    <br>It made me really happy that I was a diva.
    <br>I think we can understand what our sister is saying.
    <br>That evil spirit really had pushed her to do so many things,
    <br>especially in the area of relationships with men.
    <br>It pushed her to be breaking the hearts of men she went out with,
    <br>and she said that that spirit actually made her happy any time she saw these men cry
    <br>because there was a spiritual husband that was pushing her to do such things.
    <br>Sister, can you explain to us apart from these experiences and encounters with men
    <br>what other areas did these evil spirits push you into in terms of your lifestyle?
    <br>You mentioned earlier you were drinking excessively.
    <br>Can you just explain a little bit more about your lifestyle at that time?
    <br>It destroyed me to the extent that I was always disappointed and felt betrayed.
    <br>Whatever I did or wherever I went, I felt so disappointed and started hating myself
    <br>to the extent that I would not go to work.
    <br>I run my own business.
    <br>I would call my employees and tell them, "I am not feeling well, so fill my job for me and do the rest;
    <br>I will see you in the evening".
    <br>Sometimes, I did not go there and told them that my son was not well.
    <br>I would be lazy and lose a lot of money.
    <br>Tell us - would you be going out to clubs?
    <br>When you go out to clubs, what were the kinds of things you would be drinking,
    <br>and what would be happening there?
    <br>I would start drinking early at around 9 am almost every day.
    <br>I would smoke and end up going to night clubs at around midnight where I would drink whiskey,
    <br>tequila, savanna dry, up to 24 bottles a day.
    <br>I went home and would wake up with my bag and shoes on.
    <br>I would ask myself, "How did I end up home?
    <br>The last thing I remember was that I was dancing in a night club".
    <br>You would drink to the point where you would lose consciousness, and then from the night club,
    <br>you would just find yourself back in your house?
    <br>I would find myself bruised and ask my fiancé, "How did I get here?"
    <br>Sometimes, he would be sleeping and I would be out drinking with my friends.
    <br>I would ask him, "How did I get here?
    <br>Did you go and pick me up at the club?"
    <br>He said, "No, your friends came here and you passed out.
    <br>Actually, I was the one who took you out of the car to our bed".
    <br>Sometimes, he would find messages and start hitting me
    <br>but I would not fight for myself because I was under the influence of drugs.
    <br>I would not even know what was going on.
    <br>We just want to understand, how much alcohol were you taking on a daily basis?
    <br>Just give us an idea of how much.
    <br>On a daily basis, I would take 24 bottles of savanna dry, 1 bottle of jameson whiskey,
    <br>and on top of that I would take shots of tequila or springbok.
    <br>We can understand how severe our sister's alcohol addiction became as a result of this evil spirit
    <br>that was pushing her into such a lifestyle.
    <br>You mentioned that in the midst of this you were also smoking. Is that right?
    <br>Yes. Whenever I started drinking...
    <br>When I was not drinking, I would not smoke but when I drank, I would start smoking.
    <br>Even when my fiancé asked me not to smoke,
    <br>I would say that I would smoke no matter what and I became arrogant.
    <br>I would go to the ladies and start smoking.
    <br>I would get a packet of "Peter" or "CA" and then I would start smoking on my own.
    <br>My fiancé would say, "Victoria, you have been smoking"
    <br>and I would say, "Yes I've been smoking, these are my lungs".
    <br>I didn’t see any problem with it.
    <br>The following day, I would not feel well and I would feel weak but the same thing continued.
    <br>I went to work because where my shop is, there is a bar.
    <br>When I got there, I'd send them to the bar to get me alcoholic drinks.
    <br>I would drink it and after a few minutes, I would go outside and start smoking.
    <br>We just want to understand this well.
    <br>In the midst of all of these experiences, excessive drinking, smoking, going out with various men,
    <br>enjoying breaking their hearts...
    <br>Once again - what kind of dreams were you having during this period?
    <br>I would watch different "soapies" and the male characters would appear to me
    <br>at night and start sleeping with me.
    <br>My spiritual husband would visit me through the people I liked - through the models,
    <br>actors, singers and so on and so forth.
    <br>Sometimes, when I woke up, I would find myself wet. Just to be sure that you know what...
    <br>It wasn’t a dream but it was real.
    <br>I hope we understand what our sister is saying.
    <br>She said that she would watch programs on TV, especially soap operas or films,
    <br>and the spiritual husband would take the form of a character in those TV programs
    <br>and appeared to her in her dreams and sleep with her.
    <br>The following morning she would find out that she had released, that she was wet physically.
    <br>All of this was a result of this spiritual husband that was inside of you, right from a young age.
    <br>Is that right?
    <br>That is true.
    <br>We want you to tell us...
    <br>We want to understand from you Madam - how you actually find out about Emmanuel TV
    <br>and tell us about your journey to The SCOAN.
    <br>My aunties always told me about Emmanuel TV and the man of God.
    <br>I didn’t believe him (Prophet T.B. Joshua); I said, "That's magic".
    <br>One day, after a hectic night of dancing and drinking, I  was lazying around in my sitting room,
    <br>laying on my couch and playing with the remote control.
    <br>I came across a Christian channel and thought that if I could get this channel,
    <br>there must be Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So, I kept scrolling until I found Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I watched and watched and I thought,
    <br>"Oh my God, this spiritual husband, what is happening to me?"
    <br>I saw people confessing and I said, "This is not me".
    <br>I was struggling to find a job and my business wasn’t doing well.
    <br>I called my friend and I asked her, "Where is this Emmanuel TV?"
    <br>She said, "In Lagos". I asked, "Where is Lagos?" She said, "In Nigeria".
    <br>That was this year, February.
    <br>That was when I went to see my auntie who once visited The SCOAN.
    <br>She helped me to fill in the papers and I came to The SCOAN last week, Wednesday.
    <br>When I came here, I was seated there and the wise men started ministering in the church.
    <br>They were going around, touching our foreheads.
    <br>When Wise Man Christopher came, he realised there was a giant inside of me
    <br>because he said, "Speak out, you demon! Who are you?"
    <br>He could see that there was a giant who was using my eyes in any form of power.
    <br>I tried to keep quiet but he started provoking it.
    <br>The demon was arrested and I went to sleep with it like that on Saturday night
    <br>but on Sunday, I was delivered here at The SCOAN.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty!
    <br>We can actually see on the screen here, when our sister came and you can see
    <br>how that evil spirit was manifesting, saying so many things.
    <br>Tell us, sister - for the benefit of those waiting for deliverance today - what was your experience
    <br>as the Wise Man prayed for you. How did you feel in your body? Just explain more.
    <br>I had been prayed for before; I had attended so many churches back home.
    <br>When he touched me, I thought "What is he doing?"
    <br>I didn’t realise that I was going to receive fire.
    <br>When he said, "In the name of Jesus", I saw a lot of stars.
    <br>The next thing was I woke up from the floor.
    <br>I didn’t really know what happened.
    <br>Afterwards, I felt so light.
    <br>I was happy all over; I felt like I could shout to the whole world
    <br>that finally after all these years that I had been suffering, I was freed.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>To the glory of God, sister, tell us - ever since your deliverance,
    <br>what are the changes that Jesus has brought into your life.
    <br>Since my deliverance you can see me smiling; I sleep like a baby. Indeed, I'm a new-born.
    <br>I sleep like a new baby and I'm so light. I don’t have problems.
    <br>Before, I had this bad temper.
    <br>Even if I received a text message, I would get so angry that I could crush somebody or ground them.
    <br>Nowadays, even when someone calls me and talks negatively, I just take it.
    <br>One of my friends called me and said, "Oh, we saw you on TV…"
    <br>Then, I said, "God bless you. Next time, it will be you".
    <br>Now, I am free and light. I feel like a new-born.
    <br>Hallelujah! This is the evidence of deliverance, and I believe that is the same deliverance
    <br>many of us are waiting for today.
    <br>Our sister's testimony is a great inspiration to us.
    <br>Sister, you said that before coming here, you were addicted to alcohol to the point
    <br>you could take over 24 bottles of hard liquor every day.
    <br>Since your deliverance, what can you say about alcohol and any desire you have for it?
    <br>Believe me, when I get home, I will not touch alcohol.
    <br>I recently dreamt that I was at a fairground with many people and there were games.
    <br>I came across a plastic bag with two cans of beer and one bottle or water.
    <br>I picked it up, opened it and found that there were two cans of alcohol and a bottle of water inside it.
    <br>I went all around the fairground until I found the owner of the plastic bag
    <br>and then, in my dream, I gave him the beers but took out the water.
    <br>Indeed, I have been delivered.
    <br>I will never go back to drinking, smoking or cheating.
    <br>Glory be to God. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sister, early on you mentioned that when Wise Man Christopher prayed for you,
    <br>he identified that there was power in your eyes.
    <br>Could you just explain - what can you say about your eyes
    <br>and the strange power you realised you had in your eyes before the deliverance?
    <br>It started when I was in grade 7.
    <br>A certain man came to me and said, "Wow, I love your eyes".
    <br>I said, "OK, thanks."
    <br>When I started growing up, every man, everywhere I went,
    <br>would fall for my eyes, especially in the night clubs.
    <br>Whenever I was drinking at the counter, they would come and propose and start talking about my eyes.
    <br>I didn’t even know that they possessed evil power.
    <br>Every man fell for my eyes, even my fiancé.
    <br>That was how the devil really hooked me up.
    <br>What is your word of encouragement and advice to viewers around the world right now,
    <br>especially those, who are in the same problem you were once in, being addicted to alcohol, smoking,
    <br>cheating around with many boyfriends and men - what is your advice to them now that you are delivered?
    <br>I would advise them to come to Jesus.
    <br>Jesus is alive. He lives. He never said goodbye.
    <br>It is never too late to repent.
    <br>The doors of the house of the Lord are always open 24/7.
    <br>Just give your faith to the Lord and give Him all your heart, mind and strength.
    <br>In everything you do, praise Him each moment you live.
    <br>Amen. One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>The evidence of Jesus is lives changed as we can see.
