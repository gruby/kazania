    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>This hand - there is another hand. Do you see?
    <br>There is another hand that is touching this woman.
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>That hand that is touching her is the hand that heals, not me.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>So therefore, the work of healing is not my work.
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>So human hand is not needed to do that job, but I am just here to tell you about it - the Healer.
    <br>But I'm not the Healer. But He has no tongue but my tongue to tell you, He is the healer.
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Remove it!
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You can turn your neck!
    <br>Healed Of Stiff Neck & Lumbar Syndrome
    <br>No Longer Using Neck Collar & Lumbar Corset
    <br>Turn it up.
    <br>Ok, so you can go.
    <br>Healed Of Stiff Neck & Lumbar Syndrome
    <br>No Longer Using Neck Collar & Lumbar Corset
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Amen, I am healed!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, my wife is healed.
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Ok, can you help.
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Ok, it's alright.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am free.
    <br>Praise the Lord, I am free.
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Do you see this man? He is gone.
    <br>Can you see? He is gone.
    <br>He heals as He wills. He may choose to fall you down. He may choose to take you off.
    <br>He may choose, I mean, to still be conscious of yourself.
    <br>The Spirit heals as He wills.
    <br>So if you now believe that the way this man falls, you must fall, that is a natural mind.
    <br>Can you see? He is gone.
    <br>The Spirit of God chooses as He wills, heals as He wills, and blesses as He wills.
    <br>Some after the healing today, maybe in your dream, you will find fibroid on your bed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>While some, instantly the fibroid will come out.
    <br>Instantly while during the service, during the prayer,
    <br>you get a phone call - someone who has owed you a lot for many years will call you,
    <br>"Please, wherever you are, come and collect your money".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So He heals, as He wills.
    <br>Look at this one. Can you see?
    <br>He has not been sleeping. Did you find him sleeping here?
    <br>He was not sleeping.
    <br>But now, after just stretching hand, he's gone.
    <br>That is, the Spirit of God has a will.
    <br>He is free now. Come on.
    <br>Do you see!
    <br>Where were you? We found you sleeping.
    <br>I know that I was touched, but what happened next, I don't know, I just went off.
    <br>Stand up and see whether they have taken you to the hospital.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Ok, he has gone to the hospital.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am healed. Thank You, Jesus, for my healing.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
