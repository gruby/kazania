    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>- TB Joshua
    <br>Dear brethren, after the event of yesterday, the 8th of September 2019,
    <br>I think it would be necessary for me to devote two weeks of this month
    <br>to share with you the message in my heart and to explain
    <br>why I couldn’t hold back the tears during that song ministration which has now gone viral.
    <br>For the first time, all of you saw me betraying that very human emotion.
    <br>I pray that after these two weeks, the Lord will allow me
    <br>to continue addressing you all via this medium of social media.
    <br>Let us talk. Where do we start from? As the Lord directs. Thank you.
    <br>First of all, let me thank you for your prayers and support in all that life brings.
    <br>The following are some of the most common questions
    <br>people ask me in emails, letters, text message and phone calls:
    <br>“We would like to invite you to a wedding. How do we invite you?
    <br>We would like to invite you to a funeral. How do we invite you?
    <br>We would like to invite you to an occasion. How do we invite you?”
    <br>Well, I would have loved to be present at all meetings, occasions, funerals and weddings
    <br>but each time I ask God about this,
    <br>the event would have been held before I would receive the answer.
    <br>What is the cause of the delay in answering?
    <br>The greater my strength, the faster the answer.
    <br>It’s not that I don’t get answers often; it’s just that there is so much demand.
    <br>Today, people don’t care whether God permits them or not.
    <br>That is why you see them attend every occasion without waiting for God’s answer.
    <br>This is why there is calamity and trouble.
    <br>Thank you for now. Stay blessed!
