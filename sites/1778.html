  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Thank you for your time.
    <br>We shall take our message from two Books:
    <br>the Book of 2 Corinthians and the Book of Isaiah 40:31.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast From
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>If I may read one of the Books - the Book of 2 Corinthians 12:7:
    <br>"... because of these surpassingly great revelations.
    <br>Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh,
    <br>a messenger of satan, to torment me.
    <br>Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
    <br>But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is make perfect in weakness.'
    <br>Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me."
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Viewers, let us pray and ask God for the grace to shut our mouth and open our heart.
    <br>It's a matter of heart.
    <br>Viewers, ask God to shut your mouth and open your heart.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Ask God to shut your mouth and open your heart to receive this message.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>When we throw up our hands to the Lord, God's hands have room to work.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I want to share with you the manner in which the power of God works.
    <br>It's not by might
    <br>It's not by power
    <br>It's not by power
    <br>It's not by might
    <br>By My Spirit says the Lord
    <br>When we are weak - I mean, when we are not strong - we see the urgent need of God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We see the urgent need of God.
    <br>This makes us completely dependent on God.
    <br>This makes us to spend more of our time reading our Bible with devotion and praying
    <br>because He speaks to us through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>In Isaiah 40:31:
    <br>They that wait upon the Lord will exchange strength.
    <br>When you are weak, you are strong.
    <br>When you are poor, you are blessed.
    <br>What does the Bible mean by "waiting upon the Lord"?
    <br>There are two concepts there:
    <br>First, to patiently wait for God's time because God's time is the best.
    <br>It's not our time.
    <br>Secondly, to spend time prayerfully in God's presence with devotion.
    <br>Viewers, you can see what I'm talking about.
    <br>I am talking about identification, acknowledgment of our weakness.
    <br>To identify and acknowledge our weakness is victory itself.
    <br>Take note:
    <br>"I am a thief. I don't want to steal any longer."
    <br>"I am a gossip. I don't want to gossip any longer."
    <br>"I am a liar. I don't want to lie any longer."
    <br>"I am a fornicator. I don't want to fornicate any longer."
    <br>If we mean it with all our heart, the job is half-done.
    <br>At this point, viewers, let us ask Jesus to reveal any weakness in us and break the spirit behind it.
    <br>The spirit of this, the spirit of that - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Whatever bondage you are in - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>You know how weak we are.
    <br>Make us strong in You, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>May our strength come from Your might, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>May our strength come from Your might, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Viewers, Jesus knows all that is wrong inside and outside us.
    <br>Heal us, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>He knows all that is wrong inside and outside us.
    <br>Restore us, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>He knows all that is wrong inside and outside us.
    <br>Redeem us, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>He knows all that is wrong inside and outside us.
    <br>Deliver us, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Viewers, listen to me:
    <br>Whatever chain satan might have used to connect you,
    <br>whatever medium satan might have used to connect you - ancestral, predecessor,
    <br>whatever medium satan might have used to connect you -
    <br>be disconnected and be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever medium satan might have used to connect your marital life, career, health, business, finances -
    <br>be disconnected and be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I can see chains breaking!
    <br>Right now, I can see chains breaking!
    <br>Chain of affliction - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Chain of virus - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Chain of virus - I can hear chains breaking!
    <br>I can see chains breaking, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever connects you to satan, connects you to demons, connects you to affliction -
    <br>be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be disconnected and be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Viewers, I remember I shared with you one of my habits last meeting.
    <br>I am going to share one more today.
    <br>Pray and walk. Pray and talk. Pray and look. Pray without ceasing.
    <br>When you are taking your hot water and lemon, if your health condition permits you,
    <br>I advise you to consult your doctor for counsel, e.g. pregnant women, consult your doctor for advice.
    <br>God is the God of nature.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast From

    <br>My habit: I pray, I walk. I pray, I talk.
    <br>I pray, I sit. I pray, I look.
    <br>I pray, I sleep. I pray, I joke.
    <br>As I'm here and talking to you, I'm praying at the same time, while talking to you.
    <br>I use all my time, my days getting my heart in tune for prayer.
    <br>When you look at the Book of Job 11:13-19,
    <br>it is not possible to spend all your days and all your time with the word of prayer on your lips.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus..."
    <br>"How are you?"
    <br>"In the name of Jesus."
    <br>"Thank you."
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>But it is possible to spend all your time, all your days in the spirit of prayer.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast From
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>As I am walking, I am praying because faith is of man's heart.
    <br>As I am talking to you, I am praying because faith is of man's heart.
    <br>When I say heart, I mean your spirit.
    <br>As I'm waving to you, I'm as well praying.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>What is habit?
    <br>Habit is a gift from God.
    <br>Anything you do twice becomes easier.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast From
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>I play every day - it is a habit.
    <br>I jump every day - it becomes my habit.
    <br>It's a gift from God.
    <br>Let's take a look at some of Biblical characters, in the Bible.
    <br>Let's talk about Daniel 6:10; Daniel prayed three times in a day.
    <br>That is habit.
    <br>Are you talking of the Psalmist?
    <br>The Psalmist prayed seven times daily, in the Book of Psalm 119:164.
    <br>Let's talk about the disciples of Jesus;
    <br>they met on the first day of each week (Acts 20:7).
    <br>Habit is a gift of God.
    <br>I pray and walk. I pray and jump.
    <br>I pray and laugh. Before I laugh, I pray.
    <br>It's not the kind of prayer we offer out there.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus..." - it is not possible.
    <br>Spirit prayer.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast From
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>I can only do that prayer in the Spirit.
    <br>I'm praying but Spirit prayer.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast From
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>I pray and walk. I pray, I move.
    <br>"How are you?" I pray, I greet.
    <br>That is my secret.
    <br>But you say, "How do you pray in the Spirit?"
    <br>Meditate on what you read in the Bible, turn it over and over and over again.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast From
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>When you turn it over and over and over again, your spirit will act on the Word.
    <br>And when the spirit acts on the Word, it gains supremacy over you.
    <br>What you want to say is not what you are saying because there is a spirit you cannot resist.
    <br>Look at me - this is not what I want to do but I cannot resist.
    <br>That is the power of God.
    <br>Am I not too young to do this?
    <br>But that is the power of God.
    <br>When you begin to meditate on what you read, turn it over and over and over again in your heart -
    <br>your heart means your spirit, your spirit will act upon it.
    <br>And when your spirit acts upon the Word, it gains supremacy over you.
    <br>See me - there is a force behind.
    <br>Who is the force?
    <br>God.
    <br>You are not alone.
    <br>When you speak, God speaks.
    <br>When you talk, God talks - that is gaining supremacy over you.
    <br>When you look, God looks.
    <br>When you laugh, God laughs - that is gaining supremacy over you.
    <br>Viewers, I want to leave you here.
    <br>Lord Jesus, assure viewers that You are in control.
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I will leave you in faith, expecting to meet you in faith.
    <br>Listen to this:
    <br>This prayer is not time-bound.
    <br>Anytime you hear it, it maintains God's presence.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>God bless you.
