    <br>Is your life sealed with the Blood of Jesus?
    <br>Are you covered with the blood of Jesus?
    <br>Come on, believe it, because believing is your connection to receiving.
    <br>You have no need to be afraid because Jesus is with you
    <br>and He has cast out every spirit of fear and anxiety.
    <br>Come on, believe that your life is sealed with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>As we cover ourselves with the Blood of Jesus right now,
    <br>believe and begin to act faith.
    <br>Remember, faith is expecting God to do what He has promised
    <br>and His promises are full and free.
    <br>Just receive it, in Jesus' name.
