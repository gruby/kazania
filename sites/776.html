    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>There is a brother there - you are a witch doctor.
    <br>Let me call you a spiritualist.
    <br>That is the modern name now.
    <br>You cannot hear 'witch doctor' or 'babalawo' again.
    <br>All are now spiritualists.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>Modern spiritualist - he's there. Please, come.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Hallelujah. Thank you.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>I am a traditional doctor - a chief priest.
    <br>Chief priest, you wear a modern t-shirt?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Assuming I did not call you out, you would still go back to the life of a chief priest.
    <br>Can you move back - see the chief priest.
    <br>He wears the latest.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>I told you, they are spiritualists nowadays.
    <br>You see the t-shirt and the latest trainers.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Man of God, everything you said about me is true.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Dr Samson Omaye.
    <br>I am from Edo State (Nigeria).
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye
    <br>Edo, Nigeria
    <br>This man is my younger brother.
    <br>He is also a community leader.
    <br>The next person is my immediate brother,  from the same community.
    <br>The next person is my elder brother - the head of our family.
    <br>The next person is my younger brother.
    <br>The brother in blue attire is a relative.
    <br>I am Dr Samson Omaye, the chief priest of sango and obaluaye.
    <br>What do you mean by that because many people do not understand?
    <br>These were the idols I worshipped.
    <br>They did some things for people who came to me for help.
    <br>In other words, you are a chief priest serving idols?
    <br>Yes, I served idols.
    <br>I served these idols for 35 years.
    <br>I reside in Ologbo, Edo State.
    <br>I want to testify about the prophecy the man of God gave me on June 5,
    <br>when I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I sat at the extreme end of the church.
    <br>The day I came to The SCOAN, I disguised myself.
    <br>I wanted to know if the man of God would be able to identify me.
    <br>I came with jeans and a t-shirt.
    <br>The prophecy he gave me that day was very correct.
    <br>When people came to me, I would give them medicine and different charms
    <br>but at the end of the day, they would come and tell me that the things did not work.
    <br>I started realising many things in my life -
    <br>that this had been obstructing me and giving me problems.
    <br>Things were not working well with my family
    <br>and it gave me sickness and many other negative things.
    <br>Each time my wife gave birth, the baby would die; this happened four times.
    <br>So, I felt as a chief priest, why should I serve deities that were not working
    <br>but made me to suffer.
    <br>So, I wanted to denounce them and said that I didn't want to do it.
    <br>Each time I made a move, these things would strike me with stroke.
    <br>So, I would go back and serve them again.
    <br>After serving them, I would recover; this happened three times.
    <br>I was worried and complained to my younger brother who works here in Lagos.
    <br>I told him that I wanted to stop this job of serving idols because there was nothing good in it.
    <br>It has given me a lot of problems - no peace, resting or peace of mind.
    <br>Other people who also worked for them were also saying that it wasn't working for them.
    <br>So, what is the point.
    <br>My brother told me to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I told him that I had never been to Lagos before.
    <br>Since I was born, I had never stepped into any church
    <br>because I believed that idol worshipping was the best.
    <br>He said that I should watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I installed DSTV, GoTV and MyTV and started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw the way the man of God was delivering people and I was excited.
    <br>I was convinced.
    <br>When I wanted to leave my place, I did not tell my family and wife
    <br>that I wanted to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I told my wife that I wanted to travel.
    <br>My wife asked me where I was going and I told her not to ask me.
    <br>So, I left.
    <br>I took my jeans, t-shirt and trainers and left.
    <br>That was why I came to The SCOAN that day.
    <br>I disguised myself and sat down.
    <br>I thought to myself, "If he is really a man of God, he will identify me. Let me see".
    <br>Indeed, he identified me.
    <br>He called me out and delivered me.
    <br>We only want to take you a bit backwards to when you said
    <br>you decided to come to The SCOAN through your brother
    <br>who introduced you to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>When you came, you said you intentionally disguised yourself?
    <br>Can you tell us why you disguised yourself. Why?
    <br>Because I wanted to know if the man of God could identify me
    <br>as a witch doctor, spiritualist and chief priest.
    <br>That was why I disguised myself.
    <br>Ok. How did you feel at the moment when the man of God spotted you out among the crowd?
    <br>When he spotted me out, I was very happy because that was the reason I came.
    <br>When he called me and I came out, the people who sat near me were looking at me
    <br>because the way I was dressed and disguised, they never knew that I was that type of person.
    <br>So, they held me but I removed their hands and said,
    <br>"Leave me, do you know the reason I am here? I came here for a reason".
    <br>When I came out, the usher asked me for proof that I was a witch doctor.
    <br>So, I brought the photographs to show them so that they could believe that I was the person.
    <br>The reason I want to quit this job - I served these deities for 35 years
    <br>but I encountered problems in my family and with my wife.
    <br>My wife gave birth to a baby four times but each time, the baby died.
    <br>The people I worked for would also come back and tell me that the charms were not working.
    <br>So, I decided to quit and that was why I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I had bad dreams - I would fight with demons and they would chase me,
    <br>eating in my dream and they would hold cutlasses and axe and chase me in order to kill me.
    <br>These were the bad dreams I had at that time but after my deliverance, I slept like a baby.
    <br>There was nothing like that again.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>We want to hear from you where those idols are that you are talking about.
    <br>The idols are outside, I decided to bring all of them here in order to denounce them.
    <br>You mean that you brought everything?
    <br>Yes, I brought everything from my shrine.
    <br>They are outside.
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>They are outside.
    <br>Can you go and show us where they are.
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine
    <br>These are the idols; I brought all the idols.
    <br>These are the idols in my shrine because I don't need them anymore.
    <br>I don't want to serve them.
    <br>These are the deities; I don't want to serve them anymore.
    <br>I want to serve God; I want to serve Jesus.
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine
    <br>This is the skin of a cow.
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine
    <br>This is sango.
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine
    <br>If anybody came for anything, from anywhere or asked anything, I would serve sango for the person.
    <br>From there, I would give it to the person to go with, for whatever they had requested it for.
    <br>At the end of the day, it didn't work them anymore.
    <br>This one is oleru.
    <br>This is oleru and ayelala.
    <br>I used it to work for people.
    <br>After working for them, I would give it to them to go with.
    <br>At the end of the day, it wouldn't work for them.
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine
    <br>This one is olugbowu.
    <br>That is, after they had come for their consultation, I would use it to pray for them.
    <br>But in the long run, everything stopped working.
    <br>They would come back and complain.
    <br>I don't need to worship them anymore.
    <br>This is esu, the deity we used to send to work for people.
    <br>Esu means demon - satan. That is, the person they are casting out in the church.
    <br>We would send it to people and something would enter the person we sent it to.
    <br>This esu would go into that person.
    <br>It would motivate that person to do wrong, bad things.
    <br>The demon would be in that person to do wrong things.
    <br>Before an esu worshipper can serve sango and sango to get into that person,
    <br>he should tell esu to go out of that person.
    <br>That is the work of this.
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine
    <br>This one is olugbowu.
    <br>After you serve esu, you need olugbowu.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>This one works together with esu to enable esu - that demon - to leave the person immediately.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>It destroys.
    <br>Then this one is orunmila.
    <br>After serving sango and everything, you serve orunmila to crown them all
    <br>so that it would enable the deities to work fast.
    <br>That is this.
    <br>Dr Samson Omaye Explains How He Used To Serve The Various Idols In His Shrine
    <br>This one is the head of a ram given to sango before he goes to work.
    <br>When they came, I would consult the Ifa to know the type of things he wanted to take from the person
    <br>before he went out to there to work for the person.
    <br>For instance, someone says that someone stole his property.
    <br>It is this deity that enters inside this person to go and steal from the person.
    <br>Before we did that, we would first serve esu, then give this ram to sango.
    <br>Then we would let esu go for the deity to come out of that person before sango would get there.
    <br>If not, sango cannot get that person arrested if the deity does not come out from the person's body.
    <br>This one is a calabash.
    <br>We don't use glass to serve sango; it is always a calabash.
    <br>Each one of these things has their own calabash we use to serve them.
    <br>This one is two - one for sango and one for ayelala and oleru.
    <br>It is two.
    <br>This one is the ram.
    <br>When we give sango the ram, they will then bring somebody to take the skin away.
    <br>Then the chief priest will use the skin to sit down to worship the deity.
    <br>That is how all of these things are made.
    <br>In line with your explanation, sir, you said these idols are no longer working?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What do you mean? When they were working before, what kind of work were they doing?
    <br>They destroyed things.
    <br>They worked for destruction.
    <br>Now, I don't need to serve them anymore because they are destructive items.
    <br>So, I had to come and denounce them because it is not good for a human to serve them.
    <br>I want to tell my colleagues out there who are serving idols that they should stop serving them
    <br>because nothing good comes from there.
    <br>It is Jesus Christ that everybody should embrace and totally submit to.
    <br>There is no light in serving idols, when they give you a pot, they will take your stove.
    <br>Whatever they give to you, they will take it back a hundred times.
    <br>It is not good to serve deities.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am no longer serving idols.
    <br>I have given my life to Jesus.
    <br>Our father, we rejoice with you greatly for the deliverance and salvation you received
    <br>through the message of prophecy that came here at The SCOAN.
    <br>I also want to advise you by saying that as much as you have been delivered through the Word of God,
    <br>go and make His Word the standard for your life
    <br>and we pray as you go and maintain your salvation through the Word of God,
    <br>it will remain permanent in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
