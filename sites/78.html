    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Those unyielding prayers -
    <br>you have been praying, fasting -
    <br>as from today, you can do all things
    <br> through Christ Jesus who strengthens you.
    <br>I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Not that you deserve it but Jesus
    <br>anoints those who He chooses to anoint.
    <br>He chose you today!
    <br>You are a chosen one!
    <br>I don't deserve it;
    <br>He decided to choose me.
    <br>He chooses whom He chooses,
    <br>He loves whom He loves.
    <br>I am anointed today,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Mass Prayer With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Stretch your hand forward!
    <br>Begin to lay your hand right now -
    <br>the anointed hand, the right hand of God,
    <br>those who are for us, for us, pray with us!
    <br>Stretch your hand! You will feel the
    <br>vibration, presence of God.
    <br>Yes! As it should be, by divine will,
    <br>in Jesus' name!
    <br>Say, as it should be, by divine will!
    <br>Something divine cannot be ordinary.
    <br>If it were ordinary, you are not qualified
    <br>Something divine cannot be ordinary,
    <br>If it were ordinary, brother,
    <br>TB Joshua, that is giving it,
    <br>he may not give me
    <br>but God chooses as He wills.
    <br>Mass Prayer With T.B. Joshua
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Every hand that participated,
    <br>be anointed!
    <br>Every tongue that participated,
    <br>be anointed!
    <br>Every hand -
    <br>the right hand of God is power!
    <br>The right hand of God is power!
    <br>Say, tongue!
    <br>I have received tongue to loose and
    <br>bind, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>As the mass prayer was conducted
    <br>by Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>thousands of people received instant healing.
    <br>One particular lady miraculously, the Holy Spirit
    <br>flushed out of her body a fibroid
    <br>while praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When the power of God is present,
    <br>healing is like breathing,
    <br>deliverance is like breathing and
    <br>breakthrough is like breathing.
    <br>The age of miracles has not passed.
    <br>The Miracle-worker is still alive -
    <br>His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, let's watch.
    <br>Look at the screen of your television.
    <br>This is a woman that has come today with a problem of multiple fibroid.
    <br>and while the prayer is going on with the man of God,
    <br>the fibroid started coming out of her body.
    <br>Rise up and give thanks to God!
    <br>Whatever that is not of God now,
    <br>when you leave here, go to the restroom.
    <br>You will begin to shit out
    <br>what is not part of your life.
    <br>What is the trouble in your business?
    <br>You will use your mouth to loose it and to bind it.
    <br>Your finances will be reinstated.
    <br>Your marriage will be restructured.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>I am happy for your life.
