    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>This woman has come to The SCOAN with the problem of difficulty in walking
    <br>and is unable to walk unaided.
    <br>She struggles to sit down and the extreme pain and discomfort she feels with each movement
    <br>is evident on her facial expression.
    <br>On her placard we can see that she has been suffering from tuberculosis of the spine
    <br>for the past 36 years.
    <br>Gabriella Filak
    <br>64 Years Old
    <br>I came from Hungary.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>My legs and spine have been with tuberculosis for 36 years.
    <br>Because of that, all the nerves in my body from my head to my feet are hurting me.
    <br>I am constantly in excruciating pain.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>I have difficulty in walking due to tuberculosis in my spine.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>More than 36 years.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>When I get up in the morning, for the first half hour,
    <br>I cry because of the excruciating pain.
    <br>My knees are twisted and my ankles are also twisted.
    <br>When I wake up, my legs are often cramped and I cannot put on my socks
    <br>properly because my knees are twisted; so, I have to put on my socks
    <br>and shoes backwards and this also causes excruciating pain.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>Where have you gone is search of solution to this problem?
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>I have been to all the hospitals in Budapest.
    <br>They said none of them can help me; I have to live with this condition for the rest of my life.
    <br>Later, I got bitten by a poisonous tick and since then, my whole body
    <br>has been poisoned and that has just complicated the matter.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>I believe and that is why I came on this journey because I am convinced
    <br>that Jesus Christ will heal me from top of my head to the soles of my feet
    <br>and I will praise Him and say, "Hallelujah!"
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>As an instrument in the hands of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer to the people
    <br>at The SCOAN prayer line, in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>With each touch, the lightening power of God breaks every yoke of bondage in their lives
    <br>and the captives are set free.
    <br>Among them is Mrs Gabriella Filak.
    <br>I have tuberculosis of the spine.
    <br>Mrs Gabriella desperately cries our for Jesus' attention
    <br>and as Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for her, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>the resurrection power of God flows through her damaged system,
    <br>reviving and restoring her back to the original position in which God had created her.
    <br>We can see how her whole body reacts and vibrates in response to the Spirit-filled prayer.
    <br>As the spiritual operation comes to an end,
    <br>the man of God directs her to walk freely and she is healed.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>Our mother here has such a wonderful testimony to share.
    <br>Gabriella Filak
    <br>Hungary
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>You are very welcome.
    <br>Tell us more about the physical problems that brought you here to The SCOAN.
    <br>I had excruciating pain, so much so that every morning when I woke up,
    <br>I woke up crying because of the pain that I had in my legs, hips and spine.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>It started when I was born.
    <br>The doctors said that I wouldn't live because I weighed only 1,70 kilos.
    <br>Later, when I was 17 years old, I fell from a high rock.
    <br>The rock hit my hip bone.
    <br>We went to the doctors and they did not know what was wrong with me.
    <br>I had to stay for a whole year lying on my bed without any help
    <br>until finally, they put me in an iron frame to walk.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>I went to all the different hospitals in Budapest, where I live
    <br>but none of them could help me.
    <br>Finally, they sent me to a specialist hospital
    <br>in Budakeszi, where they found that I had TBC in my hip bone.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>They did not know what to do with me; so, finally, I had a seven hour operation.
    <br>In this operation, they broke my leg intentionally
    <br>and then attached it by metal to my hip.
    <br>They said if they did not do that, I would not be able to live at all.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>It has been 46 years in total that I had been suffering and in pain.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>As the years progressed, I had progressively more pain.
    <br>When I spoke to the doctors, they told me that they were very sorry.
    <br>There was nothing that could be done for me medically.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>OK. We can see our mother is here today, in The SCOAN.
    <br>Tell us, how did you find out about this ministry?
    <br>First of all, my sister who speaks English, saw T.B. Joshua on the internet
    <br>and told me that I had to come here and that I would definitely get help.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>I could hardly wait for the prophet to come.
    <br>When he was coming near to me, I started to shout for help.
    <br>Then, he touched me three times on my chest.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>Then, he said to me, "Come!"
    <br>I was so happy, I jumped out of my chair and I started to run to him.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mother, just tell us: as the Prophet prayed for you, what happened to your body,
    <br>that you just sprang up and began to run?
    <br>What happened to your body at that moment?
    <br>At that moment, I was so happy, I forgot all my problems, all my pain
    <br>and I felt that God embraced me and comforted me.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>Wow. Praise the Lord.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We can see our mother is so overwhelmed with the joy.
    <br>If you just put yourself in her position, you can imagine this suffering she has passed through
    <br>because of her physical condition.
    <br>But we thank God; she is standing freely here to the glory of God.
    <br>Madam, for the glory of God, we just want to see you walk in our midst
    <br>and testify to what the Lord has done.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>Wow! Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>I would like to tell everybody that God is good.
    <br>He is not a respecter of persons and He loves all of His children just the same.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>He wants all of us to be healthy, happy and blessed
    <br>and to worship the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>Hallelujah. We pray that God Almighty will give you the grace
    <br>to maintain this wonderful healing.
    <br>And we know that as Christians, better is not good enough, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>46 YEARS OF "EXCRUCIATING PAIN" GONE IN A MOMENT!!!
    <br>My whole life, I have been a Christian, I have walked with Him, held His hand
    <br>and that is why I came to The SCOAN because of Jesus Christ.
