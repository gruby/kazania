    <br>My name is Judith Jiménez and I come from Chile.
    <br>The person at my side is my husband.
    <br>VISION RESTORED: Healed Through 'A Cup Of Water'!!!
    <br>For 11 years, I had to use glasses for all my activities
    <br>such as reading, putting on my clothes, driving and working.
    <br>I was unable to work without the glasses.
    <br>I underwent eye surgery but after five years, the problem came back.
    <br>VISION RESTORED: Healed Through 'A Cup Of Water'!!!
    <br>We want to give glory to God and thank Him for Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>because during The SCOAN Living Water Service on 27 September, I was healed!
    <br>The pictures show when I was constantly using glasses.
    <br>VISION RESTORED: Healed Through 'A Cup Of Water'!!!
    <br>During that service, Prophet T.B. Joshua said we should get ready,
    <br>and that distance was not a barrier to receive our miracle, and we believed it.
    <br>Then, we prepared our cup of water and started praying as he instructed;
    <br>"Son of David, have mercy on me! Locate me in Your mercy and grace!"
    <br>After that, we drank the water and I put it in my eyes.
    <br>VISION RESTORED: Healed Through 'A Cup Of Water'!!!
    <br>When I opened my eyes, my sight was still blurred
    <br>but I believed that I had received my miracle and ministered the water again.
    <br>When I opened my eyes again, I was able to see clearly!
    <br>VISION RESTORED: Healed Through 'A Cup Of Water'!!!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now, I can read without using the glasses!
    <br>Let me show you an example.
    <br>[Demonstrating how she can read clearly from the sermon note pamphlet without glasses, in Spanish]
    <br>Hallelujah, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>She has been depending on glasses for the past 11 years to read, and to prove her healing
    <br>she has taken this sermon and she is reading it in her own language, in Spanish, without any problem at all.
    <br>Before, I could not read like this; I had to use glasses or hold the book very close to my eyes.
    <br>Now, I can see, drive, read and do everything without using the glasses!
    <br>VISION RESTORED: Healed Through 'A Cup Of Water'!!!
    <br>There is no limitation; what is happening here can also happen in our homes.
    <br>When we believe what is happening here and what the prophet says -
    <br>that there is no barrier to healing - we will receive our miracle.
    <br>Viewers, distance is not a barrier!
    <br>I am a living testimony of what happens here; it can also happen in your country and home.

    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My name is Gilberto González and we come from Chile.
    <br>The person at my side is my lovely wife.
    <br>VISION RESTORED: Healed Through 'A Cup Of Water'!!!
    <br>I want to add to my wife's testimony.
    <br>In 2014, when Prophet T.B. Joshua held a crusade in Cali, Colombia,
    <br>I was unable to attend the event.
    <br>However, I developed a desire to know more about Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This year, we started watching Emmanuel TV and it transformed our lives.
    <br>As my wife was watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>she cried and told me she did not want to use the glasses anymore;
    <br>she wanted God to perform a miracle in her life.
    <br>During The SCOAN Living Water Service, I told her it was her time,
    <br>Jesus was going to do a miracle in her life
    <br>because distance is not a barrier, as Prophet T.B. Joshua says.
    <br>VISION RESTORED: Healed Through 'A Cup Of Water'!!!
    <br>On that day, we took our cups of water and touched the screen.
    <br>As we prayed along with Prophet T.B. Joshua, we asked Jesus to have mercy upon us.
    <br>After she drank and ministered the water in her eyes,
    <br>she called me and joyfully told me she could see clearly.
    <br>Before, she could not drive at night; she was always afraid to do it
    <br>but now she can do it without any problem.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>VISION RESTORED: Healed Through 'A Cup Of Water'!!!
    <br>I encourage you, wherever you are,
    <br>believe that whatever is happening here can also happen in your homes.
    <br>Believe it with all your heart and you will see the miracles God will do in your lives.
    <br>He said that his advice is for people watching all over the world; they should learn from his example.
    <br>When they were watching the Living Water Service, they were thinking,
    <br>"I don't have money to come all the way to Nigeria, it is so far.
    <br>How can I receive my healing, how can I reach there?"
    <br>But God in His mercy healed them in their home in Chile.
    <br>So, he wants to advise people watching that truly, the same God that is working here,
    <br>the power of Jesus Christ, is working through Emmanuel TV,
    <br>and to listen to the instruction of Prophet T.B. Joshua, to pray in faith and touch the screen,
    <br>that his testimony is a living example of what Jesus Christ is doing all over the world by faith in His name.
