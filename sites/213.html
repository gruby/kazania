  <p>    
    <br>Knowing that all Heaven was backing him up,
    <br>wise Man Christopher moves through the auditorium of The SCOAN,
    <br>touching the congregation in the name of Jesus with the corresponding power from Heaven.
    <br>As the wise man offers prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit, he encounters a demonic entity
    <br>in the life of this young man and commands the fire of the Holy Spirit
    <br>to cast the darkness out of his body, soul and spirit.
    <br>Let's watch his deliverance.
    <br>All over your body, you demons - fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body, in the name of Jesus Christ, fire!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am the prince of Persia.
    <br>All over your body, Holy Ghost fire in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>you demon.
    <br>We stripped him of all his power; we made him naked.
    <br>Stand up and talk clearly!
    <br>You said, "we".
    <br>How many of you and who are you people?
    <br>We are a hierarchy.
    <br>I come with signs and wonders to fool many.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I am the prince of Persia, and what do you want from me?
    <br>As the prince of Persia, how do you operate?
    <br>I go to houses.
    <br>I will kill him.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I filled him with anger; I visited him so many times
    <br>so that he would commit suicide.
    <br>He is bored with life.
    <br>He went to his village to pray.
    <br>We hooked him because we knew his plan.
    <br>His plan is to free the people.
    <br>I fooled him into thinking it was time to pray for his people.
    <br>We arranged it so he might think it was time for his calling.
    <br>He persevered so much to deliver his clan.
    <br>As a result of that, he got tired and then started backsliding.
    <br>He lost faith.
    <br>He knew what the Word of God had told him that
    <br>if your faith is as small as a mustard seed, you will move mountains.
    <br>But it was a failure; it was programmed.
    <br>Since then, we filled him with all kinds of spirits, new things that would trigger his mind,
    <br>new things that would make him to be full of unbelief, doubt, fear, pain and grief.
    <br>We came through music.
    <br>You came through what?
    <br>Music!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What kind of music?
    <br>During the eighties we called it 'pop and lock'.
    <br>We filled his brain with mischief.
    <br>He is an artist; the boy is talented.
    <br>He can make movies; he draws cartoons.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>He can paint beautiful things but we distracted him so he would stop painting
    <br>and concentrate on something else.
    <br>How did you distract him?
    <br>He got bored with painting and thought that there was no gain in it.
    <br>We told him lies that his painting would take him nowhere.
    <br>He decided to join a dance group.
    <br>You must have known of the 'Xfellas'.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Who else is in this body apart from you?
    <br>I am pregnant with him.
    <br>I am the queen.
    <br>The queen of where?
    <br>From the coast.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Queen of where?
    <br>From the marine kingdom.
    <br>How do you operate as a queen in him?
    <br>Through the spirit of lust.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We set him up with the wrong people.
    <br>He thought he had found life, not knowing that it's either he was working
    <br>as an agent or it was to send him deeper into the ocean.
    <br>As the spirit of lust, what are the things you have been pushing him to do against his will?
    <br>He is the shy type.
    <br>He doesn't go about chasing girls or women.
    <br>But we have filled him with so much lust and the only way he can be satisfied is by masturbation.
    <br>To do what?
    <br>Masturbate.
    <br>It has killed his plans, his career, his jobs everywhere he went.
    <br>It sends him back to start afresh.
    <br>He can dance.
    <br>He can dance?
    <br>Yes. He is a choreographer.
    <br>He has helped many to achieve their dreams through dancing.
    <br>But I gave him setback.
    <br>He will not make it – never.
    <br>What are the things you have done to his job as an artist?
    <br>How have you been using this as an "avenue" to operate as an evil spirit?
    <br>He was meant to use his gift to teach people of the deep things of God,
    <br>to share the knowledge of God to the people of the world, to break barriers, to free.
    <br>How have you been using this gift?
    <br>We twisted his gift.
    <br>You twisted his gift?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How did you twist his gift?
    <br>He was meant to use the gift to lead many to the Kingdom of God but
    <br>we have used it to lead many astray.
    <br>We used the gift to lure boys and girls, young teenagers, into the kingdom of occult.
    <br>Mention the name.
    <br>The satanic kingdom, the kingdom of the Persian god.
    <br>What are the things you do that initiates those people into your demonic kingdom?
    <br>We use them to trick the boys and girls...
    <br>What are the tricks?
    <br>To think that they are learning new moves, new steps.
    <br>New steps and new moves?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But all this is to glorify our kingdom.
    <br>Which kingdom?
    <br>The marine world.
    <br>Does it mean that - if this boy is giving them a new step and a new move,
    <br>the sense of that move and step comes from your kingdom?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When they move and dance in that way, what will be happening to them?
    <br>They get enticed; we make their hearts to love entertainment more than their God.
    <br>We steal their hearts...
    <br>To where?
    <br>... and pull them to join us.
    <br>The more they see us, the more they watch us, the more they want to be like us.
    <br>How many of them have you captured and initiated all over the world?
    <br>How many?
    <br>Ten thousand.
    <br>Who else is in this body?
    <br>His younger sister left him when she was eight years old.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She was also from the marine kingdom.
    <br>I live inside them.
    <br>What form do you take to come to him?
    <br>I come through his dreams.
    <br>In form of what?
    <br>He sees me all the time in his dreams.
    <br>We play together; I come in the image of his sister.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Since he lost her, he has not been himself.
    <br>Who took her?
    <br>I killed her.
    <br>What have you done to the family?
    <br>I set them back from promotion; I quenched it.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How did you quench it?
    <br>They must not prosper.
    <br>What are the things you did in order to quench their promotion, prosperity?
    <br>Through dreams, we make them to fornicate in their dreams in the underworld.
    <br>When you push them to fornicate as you said, what would be happening to their career and health?
    <br>They go backwards; they find it difficult to approach their future.
    <br>There is a lady standing next to you; who is she to you?
    <br>I don’t know.
    <br>I am your mother.
    <br>She is playing a prank on you!
    <br>You are my son.
    <br>It wasn't funny!
    <br>Your name is Samuel.
    <br>I don’t know.
    <br>Samuel, I am your mother.
    <br>Who is this man to you?
    <br>He is my sister’s son.
    <br>Samuel, you are my nephew.
    <br>He is on his own; he has his own mission.
    <br>What is his mission?
    <br>His mission is to free lives also.
    <br>Madam, you are very welcome.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>What can you say about your son and his character?
    <br>When he was in primary school, he was very intelligent, bright and scientifically minded.
    <br>He would make toys.
    <br>I thought he was going to be a scientist.
    <br>So, I put him in technical school.
    <br>At technical school, they discovered that he was good at drawing portraits of people;
    <br>he would draw people exactly the way they were.
    <br>He was very good at it.
    <br>I thought that was the field he would go into so I encouraged him in that.
    <br>After a while, when he reached the higher class, he changed.
    <br>He was no longer going to school.
    <br>When I sent him to school, at times, he would deviate and go somewhere else.
    <br>When I gave him money to pay for his school fees when I was not around,
    <br>he would take it, go somewhere else and spend the money.
    <br>That made me very angry.
    <br>After secondary school, I told him to prepare for an exam but he found it difficult to read.
    <br>His attention was removed from reading.
    <br>I was worried about that.
    <br>I then sent him to a computer school.
    <br>He was going there for only three months and he stopped.
    <br>He was never able to finish what he started.
    <br>I was so worried about that.
    <br>It was later revealed that he had the gift of a prophet.
    <br>He used to speak as a man of God.
    <br>He would tell you everything about yourself, then.
    <br>He would heal and deliver people and also preach.
    <br>He had a group of people who he would preach to.
    <br>After then, all that changed.
    <br>He became lukewarm and stopped attending services or fellowships.
    <br>I was angry about that.
    <br>The way he is dressed now is how he used to dress.
    <br>He had so many suits in his wardrobe, then.
    <br>But he changed and started looking into the world again.
    <br>Some dancers visited him and they wanted him to join their dance group.
    <br>I said I didn’t want that because I thought he was going to be a pastor.
    <br>I was working towards that.
    <br>I said I didn't want it.
    <br>But they persisted and he started dancing with them.
    <br>It reached the point that he became very good and then they broke up.
    <br>He formed his own group and they were doing very well.
    <br>I didn’t like it though because he was no longer going to fellowships.
    <br>Even when Sunday came, he wouldn't remember it was Sunday.
    <br>He would just sleep and not wake up in time.
    <br>Even at home, he stopped helping me in the house.
    <br>At times, he would be there and I would be sweeping the house.
    <br>I would even sweep around his feet and he would just watch me and continue doing whatever he was doing.
    <br>While some other children, when they see their parents doing certain things,
    <br>they would take over the job and finish it.
    <br>But he wouldn’t do that.
    <br>He felt it was normal to sit there and watch me doing these things.
    <br>I was embarrassed.
    <br>Even when I bought my car, I would wash the car myself.
    <br>And he would be there but not help me to do it.
    <br>My neighbours would wonder, “You have a son, why can’t he do those things for you?”
    <br>I would go and fetch water by myself when there was no water in the house.
    <br>That worried me so much.
    <br>Even the car, I only used it for three months, before he destroyed it.
    <br>He would just take the key without my permission, drive out and end up damaging the car.
    <br>He would bring it back like that and then disappear.
    <br>I would then need to repair the car.
    <br>After repairing it, he would cry and say that something pushed him to do it and he did not know
    <br>how he took the key and drove the car out when I told him that he should not do that.
    <br>I told him I would buy another car that would be his; I asked him to be patient and wait till I bought another car.
    <br>But each time I travelled a long distance and didn’t need to drive, he would take the keys and go out with friends,
    <br>his dance group and the car would get damaged.
    <br>There was a time the exhaust pipe came off completely where he parked it and they towed it away.
    <br>I came back and he ran away for two days.
    <br>I told him to keep running, that he should not come back to my house anymore.
    <br>I told him to stay away because he was giving too much stress.
    <br>Sometimes I would ask him if he came to destroy me.
    <br>I used to ask him this question.
    <br>He wouldn't know what to answer me.
    <br>It is not that he was bad in other areas.
    <br>I never saw him bringing women to the house, smoking or drinking and getting drunk.
    <br>He would just stay indoors.
    <br>Recently, I bought him computers since he does not like going out
    <br>so he could work on the computers by himself.
    <br>Recently, his group went for "Nigeria's Got Talent"; they almost got to
    <br>the first position but it was taken away from them.
    <br>I noticed that any time he touched electronic items, they would be destroyed.
    <br>Recently, what made me so angry was – I bought a sewing machine
    <br>and I wanted to sew something for myself for my work.
    <br>I did not know he had gone to my room.
    <br>The key of my room was not working so I did not lock it when I travelled.
    <br>I bought the material to sew the items and when I wanted to start,
    <br>I noticed that the machine was no longer working.
    <br>I asked him what had happened and he said he had wanted to use the machine to sew something for himself
    <br>and the machine just broke.
    <br>I got so angry and said that I would not take it any longer.
    <br>That was why I said that when I got to Lagos after work, I would come to The SCOAN and
    <br>the God of T.B. Joshua must do it for me.
    <br>Don't worry, you are in the presence of God.
    <br>He also talked about a baby girl.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What can you say about that?
    <br>Yes, that was my last born child after him.
    <br>They were so close when she was little.
    <br>They would dance together and do things together a lot.
    <br>They really liked each other.
    <br>When she was nine years old, she became very ill and developed leukemia.
    <br>I don't know where it came from.
    <br>She was taken to the hospital while I was not around.
    <br>They said that they needed blood for her and I had told them not to give blood to my children
    <br>when I was not there for screening.
    <br>So, they did not get any blood for her and that was what killed her.
    <br>After she died, he would tell me that she lived in his room, wore his clothes
    <br>and went somewhere – that was when he was in secondary school.
    <br>He said he would see her taking his clothes; this was after she had died.
    <br>He said she would take his clothes, put them on and then go out.
    <br>I was worried about that and did not know what was going on.
    <br>You evil spirit, how did you enter this body?
    <br>From his sister.
    <br>The day his sister died, he laid on top of her.
    <br>He wanted to give her life; I came into him.
    <br>You have a beginning and you have an end; your end has come.
    <br>All over your body, Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out of this body!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out, you prince of Persia.
    <br>Out of this body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Out!
    <br>You wicked queen.
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' name. Amen.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I'm fine, sir.
    <br>Come.
    <br>What happened to you? Why are you like this?
    <br>Maybe I was sleeping.
    <br>Who removed your tie and your jacket?
    <br>Who removed it?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>This is your mother.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She's my mum.
    <br>And this is your uncle?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Good.
    <br>Can you remember what you said?
    <br>What did I say?
    <br>I don't understand.
    <br>Maybe I have to remind you.
    <br>You said that you were the prince of Persia and that you were a queen from the marine world.
    <br>No, it's not me.
    <br>You can see from his present confession that the demons that were speaking through him in the past,
    <br>by the grace of God, Jesus has cast them out.
    <br>So, right now, he is a new person.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>So, no one should use what he has said and done in the past against him, otherwise the person will be tempted
    <br>and we pray you will not be tempted, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>Children of God – Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Samuel Freedom, I am from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>On my right is my uncle who is a pastor.
    <br>This is my mother who is a renowned Nollywood actress.
    <br>I was in my office one afternoon when my uncle-in-law told me that he saw my mum on Emmanuel TV
    <br>and the man of God had asked her, "Where is your son?"
    <br>and that she said that her son was at home in Enugu.
    <br>Later that day, I received a call from my mum; she said that I should come to Lagos,
    <br>that the man of God wanted to see me.
    <br>I knew and had no dispute that my time had come.
    <br>I knew the reason why God wanted me to come here.
    <br>I knew I had to be delivered from certain things that were disturbing and troubling my life.
    <br>Before I came to The SCOAN, many people had told me
    <br>that this was not a house of God,
    <br>that they manipulate people and hypnotize them to say things that they were not supposed to say
    <br>and that I shouldn't go there.
    <br>I said, "No, my time has come".
    <br>I knew that if I came here I would be delivered and saved from whatever that was troubling me.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, wise man Christopher laid his hand on me.
    <br>The evil spirit that was in me started to confess a lot of things that were troubling and manipulating my life.
    <br>After the deliverance, there were a lot of changes that I noticed in my life.
    <br>I have been transformed.
    <br>I see people in a different way.
    <br>I communicate better.
    <br>I see that I am humble; there is humility in my life now, unlike before.
    <br>I never used to take instructions; I would be so disobedient but now, I even do the dishes.
    <br>I hated doing the dishes – I saw it as a task.
    <br>But now I sweep, clean-up the whole place and keep it tidy.
    <br>I can now hear God speaking clearly to my spirit.
    <br>There have been a lot of transformations.
    <br>I am so happy to be here.
    <br>I thank God that my life has changed.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Just to reflect back to the past, so that we can have a very good reason
    <br>to praise the Lord for this great deliverance.
    <br>We know you have come a long way before this deliverance.
    <br>Can you please tell us a little bit about your past and how this evil spirit had tormented your life?
    <br>OK.
    <br>Before I came here, I was an evangelist.
    <br>I had started going to people's houses to evangelise and preach to many,
    <br>to get them saved, born again and to lead them to Christ.
    <br>I would pray for the sick and things would happen.
    <br>It got to a point where the enemy had come in.
    <br>There was a woman I had an affair with in the church.
    <br>There was something we did that stopped the Spirit of God from flowing in my life.
    <br>My prayers were no longer answered and wherever I went, anything I put hands to was no longer prospering.
    <br>OK. You mean that while you were praying for people, preaching to them, delivering them,
    <br>you had an affair with a sister in the church?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That was where the problem started from?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK, continue.
    <br>I went to my village because my grandfather was blind, so I went to pray for him to receive his sight.
    <br>I fasted for a month but when I got there, nothing happened; there was no power.
    <br>I got frustrated.
    <br>I was depressed.
    <br>The enemy used that as an opportunity to come into my life and channelled me into doing other things,
    <br>to keep myself happy.
    <br>I felt so sad; I wanted to commit suicide.
    <br>Sometimes, I would hear a voice that would tell me, "Jump".
    <br>We live in a high tower and sometimes, I would hear a voice telling me "Jump"
    <br>but I would try to hold myself.
    <br>Before I knew what was happening, I diverted the gifts I used to have before I was transformed -
    <br>I used to be a rapper, I used to sing and dance - I started doing those things.
    <br>I returned back to them and I was going for competitions, such as Malta Guinness Street Dance.
    <br>I used to dance in the church because I was in the choir but diverted it into street dance - worldly kind of dances.
    <br>When we got there, we lost in the first competition, which was the Malta Guinness Street Dance.
    <br>We went out for Nigeria's Got Talent; we had to upgrade what we had.
    <br>We started to try and get inspiration from so many places.
    <br>We used the internet to download new stuff.
    <br>In the process, I came across an illuminati webpage which said that the only way you could get famous
    <br>was by joining this group.
    <br>I wanted to know more things about them.
    <br>I went through their webpage and saw everything concerning them, including their procedures.
    <br>I also saw their master.
    <br>Surprisingly, it got to a stage whereby I was sleeping and the master came to me in my dream to speak to me.
    <br>The first time he came, he appeared as a serpent; he was looking for me.
    <br>He asked, "Where are you?"
    <br>You mean that was a demon you had contact with?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>He came to me in the dream; he was looking for me and I was running away.
    <br>When he got to me, the serpent was speaking to me but I couldn't understand what it was saying.
    <br>So, I asked him to try and talk to me in a human form, in a way that I could understand what it was saying.
    <br>Then, it transformed into a human being and it was exactly the face I had seen on the webpage.
    <br>It started giving me instructions on what to do and things I should carry out.
    <br>Before I knew it, I started getting inspirations and I didn't know where they came from.
    <br>I started using this move we call 'the tut', where you use your hands to make shapes.
    <br>It came from Egypt; his name was 'King Tut'.
    <br>We now looked for a way to use those symbols and signs from the illuminati to form a dance move.
    <br>When we did these dance moves, people didn't really understand it,
    <br>they'd think it's just a dance move, it's a step but they didn’t know that
    <br>they were being drawn into that kingdom.
    <br>The more they would see the signs, the more they would do it, the more they would become loyal to the enemy.
    <br>You mean the inspiration you got from the demons, you put them into practice in your dances.
    <br>People would see it as an ordinary dance move but they wouldn't know that this was from the evil world,
    <br>and this influenced people and got them initiated.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They would say, "Ah, where did you get these moves from? They're cool.
    <br>We would like to join you, so you can teach us more".
    <br>So, we opened a dance academy and were bringing more souls into the kingdom of darkness
    <br>to teach them these moves that they had hunger to learn.
    <br>We went out there, danced in the clubs, we'd have shows; the more people watched these things,
    <br>the more the enemy came to torment them in their dreams, programmed them to act the way we would act.
    <br>Even our dressing says a lot, the way we dress.
    <br>Thank God, when I came to The SCOAN, there was a dress I was supposed to put on, I loved it so much,
    <br>it had the symbol and the sign of the illuminati.
    <br>My mum would always tell me, "Don't dress that way; don’t look that way.
    <br>You have clothes and suits, try to put them on. It's not good".
    <br>I had to dress normally.
    <br>In other words, you mean that the kind of dress you put on and the signs and symbols on them
    <br>should not be overlooked, and they mean more than their ordinary look - is that right?
    <br>Yes, they influence your subconscience.
    <br>Before you know what is going on, you will start seeing them everywhere you go, anything you think.
    <br>Whatever anyone does, you would say, "That is the sign".
    <br>You start seeing demons everywhere you go.
    <br>My coming to The SCOAN has brought me back.
    <br>Thank God the man of God took us to the prayer mountain where we stayed, prayed and fasted.
    <br>Ever since then, my memory has come back and now I have more understanding about the things of God.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>During your deliverance the evil spirit identified itself as a "prince of Persia".
    <br>Tell us, when did you notice that the evil spirits had come into your life?
    <br>There was a video game I had in my house, sometimes, I played it just to keep myself busy;
    <br>it's called 'The Prince of Persia'.
    <br>I had the movies in my house and used to watch them and played the game.
    <br>Before I knew what was happening, I started seeing myself
    <br>doing the same things that the character in that game was doing.
    <br>I saw myself fighting with a sword in the spirit, flying, doing a lot of things that I never knew
    <br>I could do in my dreams.
    <br>It started affecting me physically.
    <br>I started to want to fly and do the same things in the physical realm.
    <br>So, we had to put those things into our dance moves.
    <br>We would 'fly'.
    <br>We wouldn’t stay on the ground; we hated the ground.
    <br>We kept 'flying' up and down everywhere.
    <br>We did a lot of things that were frightening to people but they loved it, it was entertaining to them.
    <br>So, I would like to advise people, who watch movies, they should be careful of what they watch
    <br>because it influences our minds and lives, without you even knowing it.
    <br>The evil spirit also said it led you to so many other things, like masturbation and others...
    <br>Can you tell us why you were doing all these things?
    <br>Were you conscious of what you were doing at that time?
    <br>It was the evil spirit that made me to do it.
    <br>I couldn’t have done it out of my own, it was the evil spirit that forced me.
    <br>Each time I did it, I would regret.
    <br>I kept crying, "God, deliver me, save me from this. When am I going to stop this?
    <br>OK, after this one, this will be the last time I do it".
    <br>But I would still find myself doing those things without knowing what was the cause of it.
    <br>I thank God everything is over now.
    <br>You no longer see all those things and characters you used to see in your dreams. Do you?
    <br>I no longer see them.
    <br>I used to hear voices that would tell me to go and deceive people.
    <br>The more you did it, the more famous you'd get, in a sense.
    <br>Those voices, I don’t hear them anymore; they are gone now.
    <br>I only hear the Spirit of God speaking and telling me, "Study, pray more, fast and carry out
    <br>the character of Christ. Show them the foundation doctrines of Christ,
    <br>that is all I want you to do here on earth".
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>Now that you are totally delivered, we want to encourage you to remain in faith in Christ Jesus.
    <br>It is not enough for us to come and receive deliverance but we must also remember that we need to submit
    <br>totally to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Make His Word the standard for your life so that the deliverance you have received
    <br>will be permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I want to advise our parents that whatever you don’t want your little kids to know,
    <br>you should not allow those things to hang around in the house.
    <br>Take them away and don’t even use them.
    <br>There is something that demons can do, they will lead kids to find those things wherever you hide them.
    <br>Even if it is inside your bag, they will still go there and find those things.
    <br>The Bible says, train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
    <br>When they watch those things, it influences them.
    <br>I have a message for teenagers and youth.
    <br>Mind the kind of things you download into your phone.
    <br>Do away with worldly music.
    <br>Do away with anything that does not have the symbol of God on it.
    <br>Now in my phone, I do not have any worldly music;
    <br>I deleted everything that concerns the enemy.
    <br>All I have in my phone now, is Gospel music -
    <br>things that speak to me more about God, that bring me closer to God.
    <br>I believe that when we do away with these things, the enemy has no power over us.
    <br>I also have an advice for pastors: keep praying, never say, "Let us just do this, God is a forgiving Father.
    <br>He will have mercy when we do this and pray about it. He is a merciful God, He is going to forgive us our sins".
    <br>That was how all these things started.
    <br>Once you fall into sin, the enemy does not waste a split second to come into your life and begin to manipulate it.
    <br>For those who have the angels like Gabriel, who have been praying for an answer, and have not received
    <br>an answer from God yet; I would advise you to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Although there are other churches but I believe the anointing of God's Spirit is strong and thick in this place.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Thank you very much for acknowledging that The SCOAN is not the only living church.
    <br>We have many living churches out there.
    <br>Just like you have advised - people should pray that the Spirit of God Almighty
    <br>should direct them to a living church, where they can fellowship with people of God
    <br>and where their faith can be encouraged to grow.
    <br>Thank you for the wonderful advice you have given.
    <br>There is something you didn't say.
    <br>Tell us, what was your experience the moment you came face to face with the wise man.
    <br>What happened when the wise man touched you?
    <br>OK.
    <br>When he touched me, I felt like fighting and attacking him.
    <br>Before I knew what was happening, I became weak and I didn't know what was happening around me.
    <br>I felt power surging through my body everywhere, I felt something I had never felt in my entire life.
    <br>Thank God, I am free.
    <br>I have been set free.
    <br>I am delivered.
    <br>Now, I can use my gifts to preach the Gospel and minister to the people of God.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>Thank You, Lord Jesus.
    <br>Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
