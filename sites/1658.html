    <br>Our heart is the prayer room.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Ask God to open your heart to His Spirit.
    <br>If your heart is not open to His Spirit, nothing can be done.
    <br>Ask God to remove every barrier between your heart and God's Spirit.
    <br>The barrier could be holding offence, having an unforgiving spirit, pain of the past.
    <br>These are the barriers.
    <br>The Spirit of God wants a free spirit.
    <br>If your heart is not free...
    <br>A free spirit can attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>If there is any offence, unforgiving spirit, pain of the past -
    <br>here you can settle the matter.
    <br>When you leave, give a call to the fellow; settle the matter amicably.
    <br>That will not hold your prayer; rather, God will grant you your prayer.
    <br>Right now, open your lips -
    <br>begin to remove every barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, every barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God -
    <br>I command that barrier to be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>You need help, deliverance to remove this.
    <br>Receive that deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command that barrier to be removed in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>That is salvation.
    <br>That is the greatest miracle.
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I command that barrier to be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>We are talking of fortification; we are talking of repentance.
    <br>Here I am send me
    <br>If the Lord wants somebody
    <br>Here I am send me
    <br>That's all.
    <br>You should be a channel of God -
    <br>a channel of love, a channel of humility, a channel of forgiveness,
    <br>a channel of pardon, a channel of faithfulness, a channel of obedience.
    <br>You are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Confess your release with all your heart.
    <br>Whatever barrier against your healing, your blessing, your salvation, your deliverance -
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus! 
    <br>Believe!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say this with all your heart.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your health - be released!
    <br>Your business - be released!
    <br>Your family - be released!
    <br>Your marriage - be released!
    <br>Your career - be released, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>I am released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>You can know if you are released.
    <br>Say, "I can know if I am released".
    <br>God's Word says you can know.
    <br>If you are released, let me hear your faith.
