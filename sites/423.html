    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>I want to assure you that you are in a prayer line
    <br>just like the people you are seeing.
    <br>It is not only the people you are seeing who are here;
    <br>everyone who believes is here.
    <br>Believing is our connection.
    <br>Wherever you are all over the world,
    <br>- east, west, north, south -
    <br>you are here.
    <br>Just believe you are here.
    <br>I said, your spirit man is here.
    <br>Agree with me - your spirit man is here.
    <br>So, anywhere you are, just believe you are here.
    <br>I believe you are here.
    <br>As we pray, we pray with you.
    <br>BATTLE BETWEEN DARKNESS AND LIGHT!!!
    <br>Pray With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer
    <br>At The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>wherever you are, whatever situation you are in,
    <br>they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.
    <br>Begin to renew your strength.
    <br>Deliverance to the prisoner,
    <br>blessing to the poor
    <br>and healing to the sick.
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>As she is being delivered, you are delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer
    <br>At The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>Oh Lord Jesus, remove that disease,
    <br>remove that diabetes,
    <br>that infirmity.
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Please help us.
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>I am so young.
    <br>I had a motor car accident.
    <br>Since then, I can't walk on my own; I am using crutches.
    <br>Viewers, did you listen to her?
    <br>She said she's too young to go through what she is going through.
    <br>Demons do not know age.
    <br>Demons do not know she's a little girl.
    <br>They attack anyone.
    <br>We have to be steadfast in the Lord - that is the only way.
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>We had a motor car accident on my way to school.
    <br>I had admission to a university.
    <br>We had a terrible accident. Almost all the people died.
    <br>I fractured my pelvis.
    <br>Since then, I have been unable to walk.
    <br>Who is he to you?
    <br>He is my uncle.
    <br>I want him to first receive.
    <br>- He has suffered so much.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Viewers, you have listened to that.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Whether your situation is as big as this,
    <br>or smaller than this,
    <br>never a sickness or disease Jesus cannot cure;
    <br>never a disease Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>It is under His care.
    <br>You have to stand for Jesus after your healing.
    <br>You are not here because you have been suffering,
    <br>or you are a student
    <br>or whatever you call it.
    <br>But, by His stripes we are healed!
    <br>Come on, give me your hand.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer
    <br>At The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>Look here!

    <br>Right now, your disease - be cured!
    <br>Your affliction - be cured!

    <br>Who will win?

    <br>Pray With T.B. Joshua
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I destroyed her when she was 13 years old".
    <br>What happened?
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you can see the little one.
    <br>The little ones at home
    <br>- a demon doesn't know she is a 'little one' - he can possess anybody.
    <br>Jesus is the answer.
    <br>This is a little one who claims to have some demon.
    <br>Little one - be released, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever cage - little one - you are in, you are released today!
    <br>Listen to her.
    <br>The evil spirit says, "I gave her powers in her breast. All over her body there is power".
    <br>The evil spirit says, "Who are you?".
