  <p>    
    <br>My name is Chioma, I came from Anambra State (Nigeria).
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was
    <br>that there was a demon that used to appear to me physically.
    <br>She said she was my sister.
    <br>Does it mean that demon was a woman?
    <br>Yes, she looked like me.
    <br>It started at my tender age, she followed me around everywhere I went.
    <br>Anything I did, she did it with me.
    <br>It appeared to you physically?
    <br>Yes, she appeared to me physically.
    <br>And she always followed you?
    <br>She always followed me anywhere I went and in anything I did.
    <br>People around me would not see her.
    <br>Anything I put on, she would put on the same.
    <br>We looked alike, the same size, everything.
    <br>She looked just like me.
    <br>In everything?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Even when they put food on the table, she would eat with me
    <br>and people around me would say that I was eating too much.
    <br>But they would not know that I was eating with her.
    <br>When I was in school, in my National Diploma 1, she came to me
    <br>and said that she was not in school, so I should drop out.
    <br>That demon that followed her said, "You know, I am not in school and you are in school.
    <br>Whatever I do, it's what you should do. So, leave the school".
    <br>She said I should drop out; I asked her why.
    <br>She said she was my twin sister and I should ask my mum about her.
    <br>I called my mum and asked her about the spirit.
    <br>You mean you asked your mummy physically?
    <br>Yes, I asked my mum physically.
    <br>My mum said she didn't know what I was saying.
    <br>I said okay; after my IT, I wouldn't go back
    <br>because she said I should drop out so I dropped out.
    <br>She told me her name was Chi-Chi and I called her Chi-Chi.
    <br>- And you called her Chi-Chi?
    <br>- I called her Chi-Chi.
    <br>People around you used to hear you when you called Chi-Chi?
    <br>No, unless it was in the night.
    <br>That does not mean, if you bear the name Chi-Chi, you should remove that name.
    <br>Please take note of that.
    <br>People around you, they did hear you when you called that name?
    <br>No, it was only in the night she would come to me
    <br>and start talking with me.
    <br>People around me would be hearing a voice.
    <br>My mum would ask who I was talking to but I would say nobody; she would go back.
    <br>But in the daytime, we talked with the mind.
    <br>- You talked with what?
    <br>- Mind.
    <br>When I would walk on the road, if I had a problem with anybody,
    <br>she would come to me and ask, "What do you want me to do with the person?"
    <br>I would say I wanted to beat the person; she would then join me to beat them.
    <br>So, what would happen to the person?
    <br>Give us account of one or two persons you people have beaten before and what happened.
    <br>There are many. Even in my school and at home.
    <br>Sometimes even my dad would be wondering what was going on and ask,
    <br>"Are you a lion or what?"
    <br>I would say, "No, I am not a lion. It's my strength".
    <br>Not knowing there were two people.
    <br>Yes, not knowing that we were two.
    <br>My friend in school - we beat her.
    <br>At home, my brother too - we beat him very well.
    <br>Even my elder ones, I beat them too.
    <br>Was there a time your mummy misbehaved, and the evil spirit beat her?
    <br>Your mummy or your dad?
    <br>There was a time when I was beating my brother that my dad came
    <br>and started flogging me; I told him if not that he was my dad,
    <br>I would have beaten him and he would have been on the ground by now.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Where is your father?
    <br>He is at home.
    <br>So, after that, when I got married, she came to me and said,
    <br>"You are married, I am not married, do you think that the marriage will hold?"
    <br>I asked why. She said that she didn't like my husband
    <br>and as she was not married, I should leave the marriage.
    <br>I said okay. In time, I had a problem with my husband.
    <br>I would talk to her and she would advise me.
    <br>She would tell me that she would call him. When my husband came back,
    <br>I would ask him, "Did anybody call you named Chi-Chi?"
    <br>My husband would say, "I don't know what you are talking about".
    <br>When my husband beat me, she would ask me, "What do you want me to do to him?"
    <br>She would be saying that it was time for this marriage to end.
    <br>At the end, I separated from my husband in February this year.
    <br>The spirit would come and appear to me and tell me what would be happening.
    <br>I would lie to my people that I had a dream.
    <br>Sometimes, she would tell me that I should go out and drink
    <br>because she wanted to drink; I would go out, drink, get drunk and come back.
    <br>She would get drunk also.
    <br>Herself too would get drunk?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>In the same beer parlour, she would be there with you?
    <br>She would be there with me, drinking; if I took two, she would take two.
    <br>But the person selling the beer would not see her?
    <br>Nobody would see her; it was only me that would see her.
    <br>You would be the one who paid for the four (beers)?
    <br>Yes, I would be the one to pay.
    <br>On Monday, she said that I should not enter the service; I asked why.
    <br>She said, "No, let us turn back" but I entered here.
    <br>When the wise man was praying, he said, "You demon, out of her" and I fell down.
    <br>Since then, I have not been seeing this spirit.
    <br>Since that Monday, you have not been seeing your second?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How has life been since that Monday?
    <br>My life is free; I haven't seen her around me anymore. She doesn't talk.
    <br>I don't see anybody like me. I sleep well. No nightmares, no problems.
    <br>It had some influence over you.
    <br>When you were coming to The SCOAN, why did it not stop you from coming?
    <br>She said I should not enter here; I asked, "Why? I want to go".
    <br>She said, "No, let's turn back fast"; I turned and said, "I will go".
    <br>Each time you went to the market, what happened?
    <br>Each time I went to the market, she would be discussing with me, mind to mind.
    <br>She would be telling me what I needed, where I should go;
    <br>we would be walking together.
    <br>Each time you travelled, what happened?
    <br>Each time I travelled, I would be afraid because she would tell me
    <br>that my time was up; I was afraid that I would have an accident -
    <br>she would be putting accidents in my mind.
    <br>Have you attempted deliverance before?
    <br>My father and my in-law took me somewhere.
    <br>You are just a new-born baby now.
    <br>Old things passed away; every other thing became new.
