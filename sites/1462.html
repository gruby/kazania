  <p>    
    <br>Just like the last time I travelled -
    <br>when I travelled to Israel, I said, "I must pay a visit to Bethlehem".
    <br>When I entered Bethlehem, I said, "No, I will not enter Bethlehem without seeing the mayor of Bethlehem".
    <br>It is not possible for me.
    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>Oh yes, I introduced myself.
    <br>I'm T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We discussed.
    <br>I said, "I'm here in your city, Bethlehem.
    <br>Since you are the governor, you are everything here,
    <br>before I would enter the city, I said, let me say hello to you".
    <br>She entertained me and gave me an award, we discussed.
    <br>Oh yes, good.

    <br>They took me to one hospital.
    <br>We just passed that hospital on the way to see a place,
    <br>and I saw sick people everywhere.
    <br>People were saying, "Aah!"
    <br>You know, I am not used to seeing people in pain.
    <br>Even when I am praying for people here and I see people in pain,
    <br>I would turn my back and stretch my hand.
    <br>I mean, when I see the pain, I feel it myself.
    <br>Ah - I said, "No, I will not be able to pass this hospital. Where are we going?"
    <br>We now approached the chief medical director there.
    <br>He said, "Many of these people - they don't have machines for dialysis and there are so many".
    <br>I said, "Ok. Right now, I'm going to provide it".

    <br>We have provided the machines for them - as I am talking now, it is with them.
    <br>We provided the dialysis machines and the woman mayor said, "Ha!"
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Don't take me by my name.
    <br>Take me by love - my name is love.
    <br>My name - you are the one who calls me prophet, pastor, bishop, whatever name you call me.
    <br>That is the name you gave me.
    <br>But the name God has given me from Heaven is love.
