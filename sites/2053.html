    <br>SPECIAL PRAYER WITH PROPHET TB JOSHUA!!!
    <br>Let's hear from him on where he has been for some time now
    <br>and listen to what he has to say...
    <br>SPECIAL PRAYER WITH PROPHET TB JOSHUA!!!
    <br>I am here on the mountain where the year of fear, the year of humility
    <br>and many other things were revealed in the past.
    <br>I have been here for the past four days to know God's mind
    <br>about the remaining two months of the year 2020.
    <br>The matter concerns the issue of what is going on in the American election,
    <br>the issue of what is going on in my nation, Nigeria,
    <br>and all other African countries and the whole world at large.

    <br>I will be leaving today to share with you the vision I received.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23).
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua At The Prayer Mountain -
    <br>October 30, 2020
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Lord Jesus, give me the courage to say the word you spoke on the Cross:
    <br>"Into Your hands I commit my spirit"
    <br>Whatever affliction, whatever sickness, whatever disease in your body -
    <br>Lord Jesus, forgive them of all their iniquities and release them from all these afflictions.
    <br>All these afflictions - release them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Affliction in their organs, internal organs, from head to toes - release them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever affliction - strange affliction, strange pain in their system -
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever affliction in your internal organs, in your system, in your faculties -
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I declare Galatians 3:13-14:
    <br>Christ has redeemed you!
    <br>Christ has healed you!
    <br>Christ has delivered you!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>No one enjoys being sick.
    <br>Those on the sickbed -
    <br>Lord Jesus, I place myself in Your hands.
    <br>Work on them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Work on their internal organs!
    <br>Work on their system, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Deliver them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Work on them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Restore them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Use me to restore them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Restore them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever affliction in their internal organs, in their organs, in their system -
    <br>whatever pain, whatever strange pain from head to toe -
    <br>heal them, Lord, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Deliver them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Restore them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Anything in their foundation that has subjected their life to struggles and contentions -
    <br>be destroyed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Anything in your foundation
    <br>that has subjected your life to struggles and contentions -
    <br>be destroyed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be destroyed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Every limitation - be broken, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I remove the work of your hands from financial captivity, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All powers that have tied you down to where you do not belong -
    <br>be loosed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen.
