    <br>I'M A MAN AGAIN
    <br>Mario Anibal Gimenez was born a man, but lived almost his entire life as a woman.
    <br>He even surgically implanted silicon breasts and pumped himself with female hormones
    <br>as his transsexual lifestyle took him across South America,
    <br>having relationships with different men.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua visited the nation of Paraguay in August 2017,
    <br>this is what happened when they met.
    <br>Man of God, help me. I want to be normal again.
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>Man of God, help me, deliver me. I want to be like a man again. I want to be normal again.
    <br>I want to be normal again.
    <br>TRANSVESTITE TRANSFORMED!
    <br>After the deliverance, his life transformed totally.
    <br>Anibal realised that the spiritual changes in his life after the deliverance needed to manifest physically.
    <br>After requesting for help from Prophet T.B. Joshua, the Emmanuel TV team paid for Anibal to undergo surgery
    <br>to remove the implants in his breasts, costing over 2000 USD.
    <br>It didn't end there.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team took Anibal to a local mall to purchase male clothing,
    <br>items he had not worn for decades.
    <br>TRANSVESTITE TRANSFORMED!
    <br>What followed next was an emotional reconciliation with members of his family and community,
    <br>all of whom were shocked at the dramatic turn around in his life after his encounter with Jesus Christ
    <br>at the Paraguay crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>TRANSVESTITE TRANSFORMED!
    <br>If we fail to realise that there are powers that cause people to be bowed down in bondage,
    <br>we will continue to fight the wrong battle.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>Right now, we are about to listen to the testimony of a young man whose life has completely transformed.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>Hello everyone! My name is Anibal.
    <br>I am from Paraguay and I am here today to share my testimony with you
    <br>and to show the evidence of what Jesus Christ has done in my life.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>I want to ask a question! Who believes in Jesus Christ?
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>I want to start from the beginning of my story, from when I was 12 years old until today.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>He said that he grew up thinking and believing that he was a girl.
    <br>It was even accepted in his family for him to behave like a girl.
    <br>He did his first surgery when he was 14 years old,
    <br>and he did an implant surgery when he was 14 years old.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>He said that because of this evil spirit that was inside of him,
    <br>he was behaving like a girl, and he was even taking female hormones to make his body
    <br>become like that of a woman's body.
    <br>After doing the surgery, at the age of 14, he felt much more like a woman physically,
    <br>and he began behaving more and more like a woman each day.
    <br>When he was 19 years old, he started taking female hormones.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>He never felt any affection for women; he rather had affection for men.
    <br>Before, in his past life, he was working as an artist, in the theatre, and was also into modelling.
    <br>Because he felt like a woman, he felt he could do more than any of the women that he was working with.
    <br>Although he had friendships with women, he never felt any affection towards them.
    <br>He only felt affection towards men.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>He spent so much money trying to become a woman, on surgery, operation, clothes, and everything.
    <br>He spent such a high amount of money.
    <br>And today, he feels that money was totally wasted because that amount of money
    <br>could have been used to help the needy, or do something else.
    <br>But he wasted all that money on trying to change, to become a woman, and it didn't work out.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>When he was 17 years old, he moved to Argentina which is a very liberal country.
    <br>In that country, he actually got married as a transsexual person.
    <br>During that time, he achieved everything he wanted humanly.
    <br>He had money, a reputation, a job, and everything. But yet, he was not happy, he was not satisfied.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>Six months ago, he received the terrible news that his mother had died.
    <br>When he went back to Paraguay, he was so depressed and he didn't want to go out of his home.
    <br>He felt there was nothing he could do, and life had no meaning for him.
    <br>Some neighbours came to try and advise him, counsel him, and he didn't want to listen to them.
    <br>Not until one day, they came and told him that he should go to a crusade in Paraguay.
    <br>He decided to go along with them to the crusade.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>He went to the crusade. From the moment he entered the crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>he felt as if he was with family.
    <br>He had lost his mother and his family, but God gave him a new family.
    <br>God gave him a wonderful family that now, his Father is Jesus Christ
    <br>and his second father is Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>At first, he didn't want to be prayed for by Prophet T.B. Joshua because of that spirit that was inside of him.
    <br>He kept resisting, and then finally, when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for him, he fell to the ground.
    <br>After he received that touch the second time, when he stood up,
    <br>until this very moment, his life has changed 100%.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>The first thing he noticed after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua during the crusade was that
    <br>he went to his house, and as he showered like normal every night,
    <br>he felt so uncomfortable with his long hair.
    <br>He felt so strange and he didn't like his hair again.
    <br>After that, he began to look at his body that had the female breasts and he didn't like that at all.
    <br>He felt so uncomfortable.
    <br>From that moment, he started looking at the female clothes
    <br>He wasn't comfortable and happy with himself.
    <br>So, he decided that he wanted to change.
    <br>But he realised he didn't have the financial means to do an operation to change physically,
    <br>although that change had happened inside of him.
    <br>So, he asked for help from the team of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>When he received the call from the team of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>that Prophet T.B. Joshua himself was going to pay for the operation to remove the breast implants
    <br>and buy a whole new wardrobe for him, of male clothing,
    <br>he was so happy that he didn't know what to do because this amounted to over 3000 USD.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua also left one of his team in Paraguay to care for him, look after him,
    <br>be with him throughout the whole process, and buy a whole new wardrobe for him.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>From that moment, after the prayer with Prophet T.B. Joshua, he doesn't feel any affection for men anymore,
    <br>there's no attraction for men.
    <br>Rather, he feels attracted to women.
    <br>Now, as he's 30 years old, he would like to have his own child one day.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>He would like to advise everyone to learn from his own case.
    <br>Although he didn't even have to reach that side of prostitution, they should learn from him.
    <br>No matter the amount of money you spend on this earth -
    <br>he said he spent so much money, but that money could not make him a woman.
    <br>Today, he wants to tell everyone that he is what God created him to be, which is a man.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We believe there are many people watching you and many people here now who have a similar problem.
    <br>They are being disturbed by an evil spirit that is pushing them to engage in unnatural acts.
    <br>What is your advice to such people?
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>He said his advice is that you should not wait before you come for your deliverance.
    <br>Although it is never too late to change, remember that only God can deliver you.
    <br>This is a spiritual problem and only God can deliver you.
    <br>God is there! Jesus Christ can  deliver you, He can set you free.
    <br>Watch Emmanuel TV, get connected, ask for help, go to a living church, and believe.
    <br>For faith, there is no barrier. For faith, there is no frontier because all things are possible for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>We thank God for your life and pray that God will give you the grace to maintain this deliverance
    <br>by making the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>We want to remind everyone that as Christians, we are to love sinners but hate sin.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>So, our message is not to condemn those who are engaging in such acts,
    <br>but to fight the evil spirits responsible for them.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>We believe this testimony has encouraged millions around the world to also seek their own deliverance,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ and experience the freedom that this young man has received.
    <br>Mr Mario Anibal Gimenez Ruiz
    <br>Testimony From The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
