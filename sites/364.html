    <br>After listening to several experts in the field of civil and structural engineering speak about the building,
    <br>its construction, collapse and foundations,
    <br>the relations of the Martyrs of Faith move further into the ruins where the building had stood
    <br>where a worker of The SCOAN who had been inside the structure at the time of its collapse
    <br>and had survived,
    <br>tells of his experience and the trustworthiness of the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let us listen to him.
    <br>Thank God for today,
    <br>and I welcome you all.
    <br>I'm standing here as a living witness.
    <br>I am Nigerian.
    <br>This is just to testify to the goodness of the Almighty God.
    <br>Right where I'm standing should have been the position where I found myself.
    <br>So, it was lunchtime and people were coming to have their lunch.
    <br>So, I should have been around there.
    <br>All of a sudden I just found myself on the floor.
    <br>What do I mean by that?
    <br>You know, it happened so quickly.
    <br>When you count seconds, before you could say "1, 2, 3" - that was how quick it was.
    <br>So I was around here.
    <br>People were coming and some people were sitting down having their food.
    <br>Some people were queuing up.
    <br>Before I knew it, everything just came down
    <br>and I found myself just like this, in a split position, with less headroom.
    <br>It became airtight so quickly.
    <br>It still baffles me how it happened so fast.
    <br>Before being a visitors' co-ordinator, I worked there, helping out with the meals.
    <br>Why didn't it happen before then?
    <br>Why was it at the exact time they came in?
    <br>I, in particular, was actually putting cups on the water dispensers,
    <br>so they could have water.
    <br>Before I knew it, I noticed the wall.
    <br>I was just gazing.
    <br>It was a peaceful environment; you didn't think about anything.
    <br>We had Emmanuel TV on.
    <br>I was just gazing and before I knew it - (loud noises) - so fast through the walls.
    <br>I was thinking, "What is this?".
    <br>It continued around the walls. (Loud noises).
    <br>It just carried on.
    <br>I was just looking, "What is this?".
    <br>It didn't register, but something triggered me, "Look again!", and as I looked, it had gone so fast.
    <br>and the wall started to give in in front of me.
    <br>That is when everything just came down.
    <br>And because I was standing, you can imagine, the force of it pushed me down.
    <br>Trust me, I am not flexible; I can promise you that.
    <br>My left leg was at the back.
    <br>People were surprised when I was explaining that I didn't break my whole leg.
    <br>Everything around me had become so sharp.
    <br>The tables and chairs had broken and they were just sticking out.
    <br>It was like having an open space which became like an apartment.
    <br>Everyone was shut out from each other, but we could hear voices,
    <br>because everyone was praying and thanking God.
    <br>That was the amazing part of it - 
    <br>people were just praying and thanking God.
    <br>Because the condition around them was not conducive, to be honest. 
    <br>There was no air coming from anywhere,
    <br>but everyone was thanking God and praying,
    <br>and I would just join them from time to time.
    <br>That was how time passed and I was pulled out.
    <br>But when I had the opportunity to come round and see this place,
    <br>what amazed me is that you can't find anything like cement or blocks.
    <br>All you can just see are the rods, concrete and stones that were left behind.
    <br>Even the equipment like the televisions and air conditioners are all gone.
    <br>So it baffles me what really happened.
    <br>As the church worker explained, all the televisions, fridges, air conditioners
    <br>and even the cement blocks and bricks were all turned to powder.
    <br>Nothing could be identified.
    <br>But I want to thank God and bless His holy name.
    <br>Thank you.
