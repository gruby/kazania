  <p>    
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>Someone asked me to greet you, "Happy Birthday!"
    <br>I was asking Him, "why do You ask me to greet people of God 'Happy Birthday'?"
    <br>He said, "Wednesday is Emmanuel TV's birthday".
    <br>Emmanuel TV will be 11 years old. Happy Birthday!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Happy Birthday!
    <br>Your Emmanuel TV will be 11 years old.
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>Wow
    <br>Jesus knows many of us here will repent because you are a true 'born-again'.
    <br>How do we know you are a true 'born-again'?
    <br>We know you are a true 'born-again' when each time you miss the mark, you run to God
    <br>because you are a true 'born-again'.
    <br>Is it not a joyful thing for you?
    <br>I can’t see your joy.
    <br>It is a prophesy.
    <br>This is a message from Heaven.
    <br>Jesus says He knows you will repent because you are a true 'born-again'.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>You know, when is a true 'born-again', you can only miss the mark; you cannot sin if your adoption is genuine.
    <br>If you are a true 'born-again', nothing can separate you from God.
    <br>You can only miss the mark; you cannot sin.
    <br>The wrong becomes sin when you refuse to repent.
    <br>When you refuse to repent it becomes a sin.
    <br>How do we know a true 'born-again'?
    <br>We know a true 'born-again' when each time he misses the mark, he runs to God.
    <br>I'm sorry.
    <br>It is over.
    <br>That is truly 'born-again' -
    <br>he is connected.
    <br>His position cannot be displaced; it's always there.
    <br>He can only leave the position for a while and come back.
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>Talk on faith.
    <br>Let someone say, "talk on faith".
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We have many books to read.
    <br>I will take the book of Hebrews which seems to be very appropriate, close to what we are about to talk.
    <br>Hebrews 4.
    <br>I will take my reading from verse 1, and the proof test will be verse 3 there.
    <br>"Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful
    <br>that none of you be found to have fallen short of it."
    <br>None of you be found fallen for short of glory, grace...
    <br>Hebrews 4:2, "For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did;
    <br>but the message they heard was of no value to them,
    <br>because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed."
    <br>Verse 3, "Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said."
    <br>Those who believed enter that rest.
    <br>It means faith and rest cannot be separated from one another.
    <br>Whenever our heart truly believes, it will always be at rest.
    <br>If our hearts are uneasy and restless, if we are afraid of this or that,
    <br>if we are struggling with all our effort to plan, resolve, plead or ask for help,
    <br>this shows that we have not yet believed.
    <br>When one truly believes, he is at rest.
    <br>When a person believes, he will no longer worry.
    <br>When you truly believe Jesus, you will no longer worry.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Faith does not come by force.
    <br>Anything that comes by force is not faith.
    <br>Faith is something that comes spontaneously, naturally.
    <br>Something that comes spontaneously.
    <br>For example, if we see a man, a person, we know he is there.
    <br>We don’t need to struggle to believe.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>Within a second, we believe spontaneously.
    <br>I am just giving you the picture of faith.
    <br>There are all kinds of faith.
    <br>Faith in faith, faith in ourselves, faith in "such of nature", faith in this...
    <br>I have faith in business...
    <br>We use the word "faith" in business.
    <br>I have faith in you, I have faith you will do the job, I know by faith, all kinds of faith.
    <br>That is not the faith in God.
    <br>If you have faith in God, you should not just believe in Him.
    <br>Today, we claim we believe but where is our faith?
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>What we do expresses what we believe.
    <br>It is purely practical.
    <br>The reality of faith can only be proved by practice.
    <br>Have faith in God; all things are possible.
    <br>Have faith in God.
    <br>The reality of faith can only be proved by practice.
    <br>We should not merely talk about faith; we should put it into practice.
    <br>Faith is a conviction.
    <br>It’s a demonstration.
    <br>Have faith in God.
    <br>Today, people don’t know how to believe and express their faith.
    <br>Many people say they believe;
    <br>I believe Jesus...
    <br>If you believe Jesus, where is your faith?
    <br>Not only should we know God as our Sovereign Lord; we should know Him like children know their father.
    <br>Take note,
    <br>not only should we know God as our Sovereign Lord; we should know Him like children know their father.
    <br>How do children know their father?
    <br>Good children depend on their father.
    <br>Good children know how much they love their father.
    <br>Good children know how much they need their father.
    <br>That are good children.
    <br>Faith can be applied.
    <br>This is an application.
    <br>You can say, "I believe" because you know you cannot show that belief.
    <br>We hide under that belief.
    <br>Faith can be applied.
    <br>We can apply all of God's blessings through faith and make them manifest in us.
    <br>Have faith in God.
    <br>The Bible is full of promises.
    <br>For every matter, there are promises that God will do for us as long as we have faith.
    <br>God will listen to us as long as we have faith.
    <br>One without faith is dead.
    <br>Faith without works is dead in the same way.
    <br>How many of us can stand to say, "I know God like children know their father"?
    <br>No.
    <br>You only know Him as a Sovereign Lord.
    <br>He owns the world, He is a father of invisible and visible, that's all.
    <br>The question – how should one have faith in God?
    <br>We have faith in God through the daily things around us.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>See me, I want to talk - "in Jesus' name", I want to raise my hand - "in Jesus' name", I want to greet
    <br>I will mention Jesus.
    <br>I want to cough - I call Jesus before I cough.
    <br>I want to dress up.
    <br>Before raising my hand I need to call Jesus to help me - Jesus.
    <br>I want to comb my hair.
    <br>Before making an effort - Jesus.
    <br>Because faith is practical.
    <br>Like children know their father; children depend on their father for everything.
    <br>Daddy, mummy - they depend on their father for everything.
    <br>There is nothing good children want to do on their own.
    <br>Good children.
    <br>There is nothing good children want to do on their own.
    <br>They will call their daddy for everything.
    <br>You are His children.
    <br>The Bible calls us children.
    <br>We children - greater is He that is in us.
    <br>He never called you an adult.
    <br>He never called you "baba".
    <br>He never called you "mumma" but you are the one calling yourself "mumma".
    <br>Mumma, baba, daddy - those names do not enter Heaven.
    <br>In Heaven they know you as children.
    <br>You can continue to enjoy being called different names; father, mumma, baba, sister, uncle, this, that,
    <br>pastor, prophet - you enjoy it.
    <br>But when you get there you are children.
    <br>Because of those different names being used you think that you can do things yourself.
    <br>That is the problem you are having today.
    <br>Before God, you are a child.
    <br>Total dependence on God.
    <br>When you want to eat - Jesus.
    <br>When you want to wash your hands - Jesus.
    <br>When you want to comb your hair - Jesus.
    <br>When you want to wear your spectacles - Jesus.
    <br>When you want to sit down - Jesus.
    <br>When you want to stand up - Jesus.
    <br>When you want to take a bath - Jesus.
    <br>You want to dress - Jesus.
    <br>You want to greet, before you say "How are you?", you call Jesus
    <br>What is the name by which they know you in Heaven?
    <br>We are known as children of God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>So, mumma - your child is calling you, that is getting to your head.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Because of that you believe that you can tie your hair on your own.
    <br>Mummy, mummy.
    <br>Yes, sir. I believe.
    <br>What do you need to do now?
    <br>I need to realise... even to humble myself the more.
    <br>Before the God I am a child.
    <br>What do you need to do as a child?
    <br>I have to behave as a child and try to know my Father.
    <br>OK, can somebody help?
    <br>To depend entirely on Him, as He is the Father.
    <br>How does a child depend on the Father?
    <br>By having faith in Him, not believing that He would fail.
    <br>Rest - when your Father is around, knowing that He takes care of you.
    <br>Can somebody say it in a simple form?
    <br>Who are you now to God?
    <br>I'm a child of God.
    <br>You are a child of God?
    <br>Not a father of God, like your children call you?
    <br>I'm a child of God.
    <br>Not a father?
    <br>No.
    <br>Not an uncle?
    <br>No.
    <br>Not a brother?
    <br>No.
    <br>Not the MD of the company?
    <br>No.
    <br>Not the general overseer of the Synagogue?
    <br>No.
    <br>We need to know ourselves.
    <br>This is the problem we have today.
    <br>No.
    <br>Viewers at home, listen to me.
    <br>Nobody will preach this without a revelation.
    <br>It is a pure revelation.
    <br>I am coming out with a revelation that will solve your problem.
    <br>Revelation that will solve your problem.
    <br>Before your children - father, before your uncle - brother, before anybody - this, MD of the company -
    <br>I am the richest, general overseer, all this here - in the world.
    <br>But think of God - we are children.
    <br>If we are children of God, what is the position of a child to the father?
    <br>Total dependence!
    <br>When you want to talk - Jesus - before you talk.
    <br>When you want to run - Jesus.
    <br>Children cannot do anything on their own.
    <br>Can a child do anything on his own?
    <br>No.
    <br>That is you!
    <br>It’s a deep revelation. People have gone astray in the world.
    <br>Total dependence upon Him – you must know how much you need Him
    <br>just like your children at home need you.
    <br>Good children, not bad children.
    <br>We have some bad children.
    <br>When you are not at home, little children would open  your pot and eat your soup.
    <br>Total dependence upon Him – to talk, look, dress and do everything.
    <br>Forget about your pride in this world, the honour you receive from you children.
    <br>Members of your church would call you prophet, bishop, this, that, general overseer...
    <br>Sometimes, when I'm going you call me "general overseer of the Synagogue" - I don't listen to you.
    <br>Because I know...
    <br>Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>The general is in Heaven, I'm not a general.
    <br>I know you want to kill me.
    <br>Not only should we know God as our Sovereign Lord; we should know Him like children know their father.
    <br>Do you actually know Him like children know their father?
    <br>You praise Him, you adore Him, you worship Him, you dance, you defend Him, everywhere you say,
    <br>"Jesus is the only Lord, He is the Redeemer, He is Savior".
    <br>There is nothing you cannot say about Jesus.
    <br>Even you begin to defend and begin to say, "I'm a Christian, I'm born-again"...
    <br>Are you really sure you know Jesus like children know their father?
    <br>You read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.
    <br>There is no verse you cannot quote, or refer to.
    <br>You can combat a battle, you can face anyone quoting the Bible.
    <br>You have a degree, you have a level...
    <br>There is no tittle we do not have.
    <br>We are prophets, bishops, we are that and that...
    <br>Do you know Him like children know their father?
    <br>Back to who we are – you are a child of God.
    <br>Anywhere you introduce yourself, you say, “I am a child of God”.
    <br>You say you are a father of God.
    <br>Do you ever say you are a father of God?
    <br>How do you introduce yourself?
    <br>As a child of God.
    <br>Why can’t you behave like a child to Him?
    <br>Why do you behave like a mumma to God?
    <br>Are you the one who gave birth to God?
    <br>No.
    <br>But the way you behave...
    <br>You only run to Him when you have difficulty or challenges.
    <br>You don’t know how much you need Him.
    <br>If you are a child of God, why can’t you know Him like children know their father?
    <br>The word "faith" is about this.
    <br>What is faith?
    <br>Faith is a heart that believes God through ordinary circumstances.
    <br>I need God to sit down, stand up, take my bath, dress up and wear my spectacles.
    <br>If you can carry God along in those ordinary issues, tell me big issue - you will slip on His what?
    <br>The best way to live life is what I'm telling you today.
    <br>You are a child of God, why can’t you behave like a child to Him?
    <br>Behave like a child of God.
    <br>It is not too late.
    <br>You must know how much you need Him.
    <br>You need Him to sit down, you need Him to eat, you need Him to drink, you need Him to sleep,
    <br>you need Him to wake up, you need Him to greet.
    <br>You need Him even to put on your spectacles - you cannot do it yourself.
    <br>Say, "I cannot do it".
    <br>I cannot wear it myself, wear it for me God.
    <br>I'm a child.
    <br>Let someone say, "I'm a child".
    <br>I'm a child.
    <br>Wear my spectacles for me.
    <br>You need this strength.
    <br>You think this strength is yours - it is not yours.
    <br>You are fake.
    <br>You think you have strength, you can wear spectacles by yourself - it's God's strength but you fail to recognize it.
    <br>When an attack comes, and the hand is paralyzed, you will recognize God.
    <br>I never knew it was Your strength.
    <br>All this time I thought it was my strength.
    <br>Anytime you want to wear your spectacles you just pick it.
    <br>You fail to know that it is God's strength, but you will know this when an attack comes.
    <br>When satat attacks, and the hand is paralyzed, you will begin to ask God for a deliverance, healing.
    <br>You would say, "Help me God. Let me move" - you recognize Him.
    <br>Please - don't wait for that.
    <br>Say, “It’s Your strength Lord.”
    <br>It’s Your strength Lord
    <br>to sit.
    <br>It’s Your strength to stand.
    <br>It’s Your strength to greet.
    <br>It’s Your strength to look, sleep, love and to do all.
    <br>Start your Christian life from there.
    <br>There are many preachers here.
    <br>Preachers, sitting down here.
    <br>If I gave them the microphone to preach, nobody would listen to me.
    <br>They are on their seats.
    <br>My brothers - let us close our Bibles, let's listen to the revelation.
    <br>It is only a revelation that can solve our problem.
    <br>What can solve our problem?
    <br>Revelation.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Revelation.
    <br>Look, this Bible, before it becomes revelation to you, you must first meditate it.
    <br>By meditation, revelation comes out of it.
    <br>For now it is the Bible.
    <br>For this Bible to become revelation, you must meditate it.
    <br>By meditation and turning it over and over, in your heart, it becomes a revelation.
    <br>Meditation turns to revelation.
    <br>Meditation on what you read, turn it over and over in your heart...
    <br>To turn something in your heart, you know when something is going in your heart,
    <br>it's going through what?
    <br>This thing.
    <br>Go over and over in your heart - that becomes a revelation.
    <br>The process of turning over in your heart is no longer in your mouth.
    <br>Then it can affect you, become a "character".
    <br>Let me use an example of the Bible - anyone can but it.
    <br>When you get to the market they will never ask you, "Are you a Christian?" before giving you a copy.
    <br>All they need is money.
    <br>That is to tell you - you make it work.
    <br>If you are a bad person your Bible is also bad.
    <br>If you are good your Bible is good.
    <br>That is why everybody has access to it.
    <br>Now - to make it a revelation, it must go through a meditation in your heart.
    <br>It must go through what?
    <br>Meditation.
    <br>Meditation can only occur in our heart.
    <br>Remember, there is a difference between meditation and thinking.
    <br>Meditation is a higher level, while thinking is a lower level.
    <br>Upper class, lower class.
    <br>When you are worried, you are thinking.
    <br>You never worry and meditate.
    <br>Until you are free of worry, then you can meditate.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “I’m a child of God – total dependence on Him;
    <br>I should know how much I need Him.
    <br>I need Him to do everything, even to talk or look I need Him."
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>Like a flower needs the rain
    <br>Like a bird needs the wind
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>More
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>I need You more and more
    <br>More
    <br>Lord, I need You more and more
    <br>I need You more and more Jesus every day
    <br>You may be seated. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>I want you to write it in your book.
    <br>Today, you are a child of God and you should behave like a child to the father.
    <br>You are a child of God.
    <br>I said, "you may be seated" - you sat without even carrying God along.
    <br>You have forgotten because you are used to those your fake power.
    <br>Because you are a child, you need God to do all.
    <br>You introduce yourself as a child of God but you behave otherwise.
    <br>This why we see people who claim to believe, who don't know how to believe and express their faith.
    <br>What we do expresses what we believe.
    <br>If there is faith, there must be work that corresponds with that faith.
    <br>Faith is expressed through work.
    <br>By this work, faith is perfected.
    <br>By this work, faith is proved.
    <br>By this work, faith is completed.
    <br>If faith and work do not agree, there must be something wrong with our faith.
    <br>It is either faith in faith or faith in ourselves.
    <br>Self righteousness.
    <br>I repeat.
    <br>If faith and work do not agree, there must be something wrong with our faith.
    <br>It is either faith in faith or faith in ourselves.
    <br>Faith in what man has done: science, knowledge, just mention it.
    <br>What we have faith in is what man has done - it is what we have faith in.
    <br>Sometimes, when we enter a church we can see the crowd, we see a beautiful church - we have faith in it.
    <br>Oh, big church, many wonderful people, president - that is enough for our faith.
    <br>Or the way ministers of God preach, "I tell you - God is love" - it is a good preacher.
    <br>That is enough for our faith.
    <br>This can be regarded as "what man has done".
    <br>Faith in the finished work of our Lord, Jesus Christ has to do with the supernatural.
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>It is as simple as a conviction.
    <br>It can not be expressed in abstracts.
    <br>That is why today people hide under the "belief" - I believe in Christ, I'm a believer...
    <br>The word "faith" has to do with a trust.
    <br>Finally – our work proves our faith.
    <br>What is your work?
    <br>Your work proves your faith.
    <br>Your work perfects your faith.
    <br>Because faith works together with its work.
    <br>I'm talking to the children of God.
    <br>Are you a child of God?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Just recognize that you are a child.
    <br>And you know what a child needs from a father.
    <br>It is a total dependence.
    <br>There is nothing a child can do without the father.
    <br>You only call Him when an attack comes.
    <br>That is why He doesn't rescue you.
    <br>He knows you are calling Him for selfish reasons.
    <br>What are selfish reasons? It is just to rescue you.
    <br>After rescuing you, you will start living your own life - and He doesn't want that.
    <br>He wants your whole life, not a part of your life.
    <br>Go, and think about this.
