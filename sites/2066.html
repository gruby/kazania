  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Gift Ayebabogha. I am from Bayelsa State, Nigeria.
    <br>This is my father, my younger brother and my in-law.
    <br>I am a Sergeant in the Nigerian Police Force, serving in Enugu State.
    <br>Last year, my father came to The SCOAN and the man of God gave him the Anointing Water and Anointing Sticker.
    <br>My father called me to come and collect the Anointing Water and Anointing Sticker.
    <br>I went home and my father gave me the Anointing Water and Anointing Sticker.
    <br>He said I should place the Anointing Sticker on my door
    <br>and any time I went to work, I should pray and minister the Anointing Water.
    <br>He said I should put the Anointing Water in my pocket.
    <br>That is what I used to do.
    <br>After prayer with the Anointing Water, I would put it in my pocket.
    <br>I would then go to work.
    <br>On May 25th of this year, I was posted to bank duty.
    <br>After banking hours at 4:00, we closed.
    <br>I went to the room that the bank gave us.
    <br>I was in the room resting and pulled off my uniform.
    <br>I wore shorts and had the Anointing Water in my pocket.
    <br>I was just relaxing.
    <br>Around 5:30 in the evening, armed robbers broke into the bank.
    <br>I was inside; I did not know.
    <br>I heard, "MoPo! Come!"
    <br>I thought it was the bank staff that were calling me.
    <br>I opened the door and answered them.
    <br>Immediately I opened the door, I saw one of the armed robbers with an AK-47 facing me and firing at a close distance.
    <br>I could not go forward and I could not go back.
    <br>I was just standing and looking at him.
    <br>He was shooting more than 25 bullets.
    <br>Fear came into me and I withdrew into the room and shut the door.
    <br>As I went inside, one of the bullets entered my stomach.
    <br>I fell inside.
    <br>As I fell inside, I saw my intestines outside.
    <br>I used my hand to support myself and held my intestines.
    <br>I then brought the Anointing Water out of my pocket.
    <br>I was ministering the Anointing Water, praying, "God of T.B. Joshua, save me".
    <br>"Save my life."
    <br>I was inside the room; they were still shooting.
    <br>They thought I was dead.
    <br>I then heard one of the armed robbers ordering his colleagues to go inside my room and collect my rifle.
    <br>When I heard that, a strength entered me and said, "Draw your rifle to you".
    <br>I then drew my rifle to myself.
    <br>I left my intestine on the ground and managed to cock my rifle.
    <br>Then, I used one hand to hold my intestine and one to hold my rifle.
    <br>I was inside and one of the armed robbers came with a pistol in his hand.
    <br>He pushed the door and when he did so I immediately fired my rifle.
    <br>That is the charm on the waist of the armed robber.
    <br>He tied a charm around his body - this is the picture - the one that died.
    <br>The moment he died, the other armed robbers ran away.
    <br>They could not rob the bank any longer.
    <br>I shouted for help before one of the bank staff took me to the hospital.
    <br>On getting to the hospital, we met the first doctor.
    <br>He said that he could not do anything.
    <br>They called a doctor that had already closed.
    <br>He came and did the operation.
    <br>Since then, I have been staying in the hospital.
    <br>I felt that I should come and give my testimony.
    <br>By giving this testimony, God will do more in my life.
    <br>After they discharged me, within two weeks, I went to urinate and could not pass urine.
    <br>They rushed me to the hospital again.
    <br>On getting to the hospital, the doctor checked and found that
    <br>when they were doing the operation, there was a wound inside my penis, so I could not urinate through it.
    <br>They then fixed a catheter in my navel. It's still there.
    <br>Do you mean that you are passing urine through your stomach?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Listen to that - a young man; he cannot urinate anymore; he is passing urine through the stomach.
    <br>If not for this Anointing Water, I would have been a dead person.
    <br>In that hospital, they fixed the catheter.
    <br>They said that within one month I would be able to urinate through my penis.
    <br>After one month, I could not urinate through my penis.
    <br>They then transferred me to another hospital, a University Teaching Hospital.
    <br>Up till now, I am still taking treatment there.
    <br>They are talking about doing another operation or using a pipe or iron to pass through.
    <br>The bank - are they taking care of you?
    <br>It is my father that is taking care of everything.
    <br>Doctor, please stand up.
    <br>I know I recognise the two of you from America and another country.
    <br>I personally want to make sure this young man gets back to his normal self.
    <br>I want to believe that that operation was wrongly done, it was not done properly.
    <br>The operation was not done properly.
    <br>He needs to go to the best hospital, whatever it will take.
    <br>Even if they cannot do that in Nigeria, I'm ready to sponsor him.
    <br>Now, you people should come together, meet the parents, let us begin to work things out.
    <br>Whatever assistance he needs, financially and spiritually, I am going to support.
    <br>If it is not possible in Nigeria, whatever place anywhere.
    <br>They have done a wrong operation; it is too small.
    <br>I'm going to stand on behalf of Nigeria, the police and the government to support him.
    <br>So please doctors, you can go and see; you have a job - just give me a report, I am ready to help.
    <br>Two Medical Doctors In The Congregation
    <br>We have many other medical doctors here - please don't just sit down, I want you to stand up.
    <br>You just examine, do your interviews and tell me which country we can take this man to.
    <br>If it is not Nigeria, tell me which country. I am ready to give support to get this young man back to his normal self.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I am Doctor Vincent Nwosa, I am a Consultant Physician in the Bahamas.
    <br>I am going to examine the young gentleman who has a catheter which was put in to allow him to pass urine.
    <br>It could have been the result of a complication in surgery in the past.
    <br>I am going to examine him and determine what else can be done.
    <br>My name is Doctor Cephas Udofia; I am from Lesotho, the President of the Lesotho Medical Association.
    <br>I'm going to see the young man; he probably has a supra-pubic disorder.
    <br>We will see what we can do after we have examined him, and give the best medical advice.
    <br>Thank you. They were here and witnessed the whole thing.
    <br>With the Spirit of God, God will guide them.
    <br>Thank you. The young man is in the right hands.
    <br>Let us know what should happen next.
    <br>We are here. Next time we want to hear the testimony.
    <br>If they give me a report that they need to transport him outside this country, I am ready to support financially.
    <br>Medically, let them do whatever is needed. Thank you.
    <br>Mr Gift, a police officer and a sergeant in the Nigerian Police Force, was on duty at a bank one day
    <br>when a group of armed robbers came to rob the bank.
    <br>He was shot in the stomach and his intestines came out in front of him.
    <br>By the grace of God, his father had given him the Anointing Water,
    <br>which he brought out and ministered on himself in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>It saved his life.
    <br>The operation he underwent was unsuccessful, obstructing his urinary tract and causing him not to urinate normally.
    <br>This led him to having to use the catheter to urinate for a long time.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>After the service, doctors from all over the world examined Mr. Gift Ayebabogha
    <br>and discovered that there was a complication in the first operation.
    <br>After the medical doctors examined Mr. Gift, they saw that there would be a possibility to repair his condition
    <br>and advised that they will need to do the operation in another country.
    <br>Before Mr. Gift can travel overseas for the surgical operation,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV Team helps him and his brother to acquire an international passport.
    <br>Mr. Gift and the two brothers were then taken by the Emmanuel TV Team
    <br>to the Indian High Commission in Lagos, Nigeria
    <br>to apply for a visa that will allow them to travel to India for a period of time
    <br>where an experienced doctor, who specialises in this particular field of surgery,
    <br>will correct the urinary tract which was obstructed due to a gunshot.
    <br>They all get out of the vehicle and make their way inside the office of the Indian High Commission Headquarters
    <br>for the required procedure that will allow them to travel abroad.
    <br>It is very early in the morning and there are many people waiting outside for the office to open.
    <br>The office of the Indian High Commission is now open and people are going inside to apply for their visas.
    <br>Among them is Mr. Gift and The Emmanuel TV Team.
    <br>A few hours later, they come out after successfully applying for their visas.
    <br>Mr. Gift and the Emmanuel TV Team come out of the office of the Indian High Commission,
    <br>relaxed and ready to take on the next step of their journey to India.
    <br>Two days after the visa processing, their airline tickets to India were purchased by The Emmanuel TV Team
    <br>in the middle of the very busy season of December, where flight ticket prices rose dramatically.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has been taking care of Mr. Gift at The SCOAN since his ordeal.
    <br>Now they are committed to go one step further to see that Mr. Gift is fully recovered and able to support his family,
    <br>and serve his country in the Nigerian Police Force, by sending him overseas to India to correct the operation.
    <br>The man of God has fulfilled his promise.
    <br>Since then, he is the one who has been taking care of my treatment, food and accommodation here.
    <br>This is the document from the Fortis Hospital in India to the High Commission of India in Nigeria
    <br>inviting Mr. Gift where he is booked for the operation and he will eventually undergo specialised surgery
    <br>to correct the previous operation which was not properly done.
    <br>This is the document by Qatar Airways approving Mr. Gift's fitness to fly with the airline to India.
    <br>This is the medical report from the hospital where he was first operated upon
    <br>and where the catheter was fixed permanently into his bladder to urinate.
    <br>Mr. Gift now has all the necessary documents to proceed with his journey to India.
    <br>T.B. Joshua and The Emmanuel TV Partners financed the visas and flight tickets for Mr. Gift,
    <br>a sergeant of the Nigerian Police Force, and his team that will lead him to India.
    <br>They will be travelling to New Delhi, India, via Doha, Qatar.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>These are the three airfares sponsored by Prophet T.B. Joshua and The Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>to take them from Nigeria to India.
    <br>Not only that, the man of God is also paying for the operation, which is $8,000 US Dollars,
    <br>and also the accommodation and feeding expenses while you will be over there - $3,000 US Dollars as well.
    <br>Just as the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has promised, he has paid for all the expenses of the trip -
    <br>the passport, the visas and all the air flight tickets for all three of them, and also the operation
    <br>and the feeding and accommodation there. How do you feel?
    <br>I feel so happy, I feel so grateful. I thank the man of God.
    <br>Because the government that I'm working for could not do it, my brothers could not do it.
    <br>The prophet, who did not even know me or where I was from, helped me.
    <br>I thank God and I thank him and The Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>May God bless him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>T.B. Joshua and The Emmanuel TV Partners sponsor Mr. Gift and his team with a total amount of $20,000 US Dollars
    <br>to cover all the expenses of their trip to India.
    <br>I am so grateful; I don't really know what to say.
    <br>If not for God, this would not have been possible.
    <br>I thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, The Emmanuel TV Partners and every member of The SCOAN.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>May God bless the man of God abundantly, in Jesus' name.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>This is my first time of travelling.
    <br>I thank You, Jesus! I thank You, God!
    <br>Mr. Gift Boards Bus To Airport To Catch Flight To India For Operation
    <br>Mr. Gift and the team have arrived at one of Nigeria's international airports in Lagos.
    <br>Mr. Gift and the team have checked in at the airport and are about to board the flight
    <br>that will eventually take them to New Delhi, India, via Qatar.
    <br>They are about to board the plane and embark on the journey that will change Mr. Gift's life forever.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>Your life is a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>You begin to succeed with your life when the pain and troubles of others begin to matter to you.
    <br>A few days after arriving in India, Mr. Gift Ayebabogha is operated upon in New Delhi, India.
    <br>This is Fortis Hospital in India,
    <br>where Mr. Gift underwent a specialised operation to correct the previous operation performed on him.
    <br>Forty-five days after his successful surgical operation,
    <br>Mr. Gift came back from India with the two others who went with him.
    <br>Mr Gift. And Others At The SCOAN After Returning From India
    <br>What a glorious trip and a glorious day.
    <br>Let's hear from them - how their journey was and the outcome of the operation.
    <br>Mr Gift. And Others At The SCOAN After Returning From India
    <br>My name is Gift Ayebabogha. I am from Bayelsa State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am the person that the man of God sponsored to India for an operation.
    <br>I was suffering from a urinary stricture.
    <br>For seven months, I could not urinate normally and was using a catheter.
    <br>The man of God, T.B. Joshua, sponsored me to India for an operation.
    <br>I went to India and the operation was successful.
    <br>The Nigeria Police Force that I am working for could not do it.
    <br>The bank which I was guarding could not do it.
    <br>Even my brothers could not do it.
    <br>The man of God, whom I do not work for and he does not know me,
    <br>sponsored my trip to India for an operation.
    <br>I thank God; the operation was very successful.
    <br>Now, I can urinate through my manhood without a catheter.
    <br>I was using a catheter for over seven months to urinate.
    <br>But now, after the successful operation, I can urinate through my manhood without a catheter.
    <br>I thank God and the man of God. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Mr. Gift walks to the lavatory to show the proof that indeed the operation was a triumphant one.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>He urinates into a bowl without the use of a catheter.
    <br>This was indeed something that he was not able to do for seven months
    <br>before the operation was done in India.
    <br>On the left hand side,
    <br>you can see the catheter that he was to use for the rest of his life to urinate
    <br>but by the generous support of T.B. Joshua and The Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>he was able to correct the condition through an operation in India.
    <br>Now, he is free and urinating normally.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>They celebrate this wonderful occasion with a delicious meal.
    <br>Mr. Gift's testimony has been restored
    <br>with the help of T.B. Joshua and The Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>to finance the operation and live his life fully, freely, for the glory of God.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Gift Ayebabogha.
    <br>I am a sergeant in the Nigeria Police Force.
    <br>I am from Bayelsa State.
    <br>These are my younger brothers, and a brother who took us to India.
    <br>Watching Emmanuel TV brought me to The SCOAN.
    <br>As I narrated my story,
    <br>the man of God stood by my side, saying that I was too young to suffer this kind of problem.
    <br>On that very day, he called out some doctors from different countries to examine me,
    <br>to know whether the treatment could be done here or anywhere else.
    <br>He said that he was ready to sponsor me.
    <br>Within that period, I was changing my catheter every three weeks.
    <br>The catheter was due for change.
    <br>The man of God gave me 100,000 Naira to change it and take care of myself.
    <br>Then, the man of God called me and said that I should come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Reaching here at The SCOAN, the man of God got me a visa.
    <br>I had not travelled outside this country before.
    <br>I had not entered a plane before.
    <br>The man of God gave my brothers and I passports and visas.
    <br>The airline ticket, accommodation, feeding and operation were all provided by the man of God.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>It was about $25,000 US Dollars that was spent.
    <br>We went to one of the best hospitals in India and the operation was successful.
    <br>Now, I am free and I no longer use a catheter; I can urinate normally.
    <br>I thank the man of God.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>I thank the man of God for what he has done in my life.
    <br>He was a man I had never worked for.
    <br>The government, I mean the Nigerian police that I work for, did not do anything.
    <br>The bank that I was posted to did not do anything,
    <br>but the man of God who I had not worked for, who did not know me or where I was from,
    <br>took over my problem.
    <br>Children of God, join me to thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners for saving my life.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr. Ayebabogha, I am the younger brother to Gift.
    <br>I am also part of the team that went to India.
    <br>When my brother had this problem, after his first operation, he couldn't urinate.
    <br>The bank had left everything to him.
    <br>He was not doing anything and my father was just a poor retired teacher.
    <br>He was the one taking care of him.
    <br>We had to take him to another hospital in Nigeria for surgery to fit a catheter.
    <br>He was using the catheter, but every day his condition got worse.
    <br>He could not do anything on his own when he was using the catheter.
    <br>We then came here [The SCOAN].
    <br>My father and I were here in 2011, when we met the man of God.
    <br>We were encouraged to come here again.
    <br>When we came,
    <br>to the glory of God, the man of God heard our cry and had compassion on my elder brother.
    <br>When he invited us here, it was not just my elder brother, he provided us passports and visas too.
    <br>He provided everything that we used over there - he paid for everything.
    <br>I had not travelled out of Nigeria before; this was my first time.
    <br>When we met the man of God, he gave us the Anointing Water.
    <br>Whatever we were going to use there, we should apply the Anointing Water.
    <br>When we arrived, the doctor met me and the brother that took us there.
    <br>When he was in the x-ray room, he explained about the operation
    <br>and they were going to cut a part of the inside of his lips to transplant.
    <br>To the glory of God, the day they did the operation,
    <br>the doctor said that when they opened his body, the place was not too short
    <br>and that there was no need to cut any other part of his body.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>So, they fixed it and after six days in hospital, he was discharged.
    <br>He did another x-ray and after seeing the results,
    <br>the doctor was surprised and said that in most cases like this,
    <br>they would have to perform surgery up to three times before it is corrected.
    <br>But in my brother's case, they operated only once.
    <br>TB Joshua SPONSORS Policeman's LIFE-CHANGING Operation In INDIA!!
    <br>In his case, they only operated once and everything was perfect.
    <br>It was not by his power, but because the man of God was involved.
    <br>That was why he did not have to go for a second or third operation.
    <br>We thank God for all that the man of God has done in our lives.
    <br>Today, you can see him here.
    <br>He is not urinating through any device; he is urinating normally as he was born.
    <br>I give God all the glory. Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Prince Christopher, the young man the prophet asked to accompany Mr. Gift to India.
    <br>They have already said it all.
    <br>But one thing we have to emphasise is the Anointing Water.
    <br>Before the surgery, the doctors met me and told me the surgery procedures.
    <br>They told me he would go for surgery three times before it could be corrected,
    <br>and I kept it to myself.
    <br>I was disturbed but it came to my mind, 'You did not send yourself - God sent you'.
    <br>I brought out the Anointing Water, we prayed together and anointed him.
    <br>The surgery procedure would be step by step -
    <br>the surgeries would be performed at monthly intervals
    <br>in order to monitor the urine flow and know how to rectify the system.
    <br>When he got to the theatre, he spent three hours in surgery.
    <br>After a week, the tests confirmed that his urine flow was normal.
    <br>These are his results.
    <br>This was the result before he left for India on my right
    <br>and on my left is the result that he can now urinate normally.
    <br>I want to assure him that all the help he has received here -
    <br>it is Nigeria that has given it to him and also the police that gave the help.
    <br>We are doing it on behalf of the government, the police and the bank.
    <br>I want him to put everything behind him, move forward and see what is next. Thank you.
    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Gift Ayebabogha.
    <br>I am a sergeant in the Nigeria Police Force.
    <br>This is my family - my father, my step-mother, my mother, my wife, my in-laws,
    <br>my brothers and sisters.
    <br>I am here to thank God and the man of God for what he has done in my life.
    <br>I was suffering from a urinary tract infection due to a gunshot.
    <br>I was using a catheter to urinate for the past seven months, without help.
    <br>Upon reaching The SCOAN and sharing my testimony,
    <br>the man of God took over my problem
    <br>and sponsored me, my brother and one other to India for an operation.
    <br>The operation was successful.
    <br>Previously, I could not urinate through my penis; I was suing a catheter.
    <br>I could not stand straight, as I am doing now.
    <br>If I lay down, I would lie face up; that was how I would lie until daybreak.
    <br>I could not eat well before having the operation.
    <br>The operation was successful.
    <br>I am here with my family to thank God and the man of God for what he has done in my life.
    <br>While in India the man of God paid for everything
    <br>- my accommodation, feeding and the operation fee.
    <br>After we returned to Nigeria, the man of God took care of me
    <br>and blessed me with a sum of money to take care of myself, which I did.
    <br>As you can see, now I am okay; I am fit.
    <br>What I could not do before, I can do now without any problem; I am okay.
    <br>I thank God and I thank the man of God.
    <br>$25,000 US Dollars was spent for my treatment in India.
    <br>He did not know me, I did not attend this church, but he took over my problem.
    <br>So, I am very grateful; I am here to say thank you, man of God.
    <br>If not for the man of God, I would have been a dead person by now.
    <br>I have nothing to say other than thank you, man of God.
    <br>May God reward you and bless you and your ministry,
    <br>the workers and The Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world. Thank you.
    <br>Children of God, help me thank the man of God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Children of God, I want everybody to thank God on my behalf
    <br>for what the man of God has done in my family.
    <br>First of all, I thank God for providing this generation
    <br>with a man of God like Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Secondly, I thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for making himself fit for God to use in this form.

    <br>Brethren, from when I started primary school, in the Bible I read Jesus said,
    <br>"Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest".
    <br>And it was in The SCOAN that I found that rest.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I am a retired teacher. How would I have been able to bear this burden?
    <br>I felt that we should come to The SCOAN to share our testimony
    <br>about reviving Gift after the armed robbers' gun shot.
    <br>As we came, you all have seen -
    <br>if you look at the clip of my face and then compare it with how I am today,
    <br>all of you will know that I have joy, peace of mind now.
    <br>Who gave me that peace? It is only God, who is found here.
    <br>How would I have taken my son to India?
    <br>That would have been too much for the entire family.
    <br>God does not need anything from me other than to come and thank Him and give praises to Him.
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>God should empower him more to continue this ministry so that the whole world -
    <br>all the doubting Thomases too - would know that God is here with us.
    <br>Amen. Let us clap for Jesus!
    <br>We say, "Amen" to that.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Margaret Gift Ayebabogha. I am from Bayelsa State.
    <br>I am here to give God all the glory for what He has done in our lives.
    <br>Who are you to Mr. Gift?
    <br>I am his wife.
    <br>I had a revelation where I saw the man of God
    <br>taking me and my husband to Heaven for an operation.
    <br>What I saw in that dream came to pass.
    <br>I thank the man of God for what he has done in our lives and in the life of my husband.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Mr. Amangala from Bayelsa.
    <br>I am a son-in-law to the family.
    <br>I will start by saying thank God for what He has done.
    <br>When we came, just as you watched the clip, the intention we came with
    <br>was just to give a testimony and go back home to face the financial problems.
    <br>As you know, as an in-law, whether I liked it or not,
    <br>I would have had to contribute in one way or another.
    <br>Just as other churches do,
    <br>you give your testimony, it is well with you; you go home and it is finished.
    <br>I was surprised when the man of God called for experienced doctors from abroad to come forward.
    <br>I was happy that something was going to happen.
    <br>Apart from that, there was financial assistance during the little time we spent at The SCOAN -
    <br>I had not seen it before - unlike my experience in other churches.
    <br>In this case, every day we spent here, the man of God would send a package for us.
    <br>The first time we came, you can see this young man now,
    <br>if you saw him then, you would pity him.
    <br>You would even think that he would not live long.
    <br>We would encourage him before he could walk.
    <br>But at the end of the day, look at him now.
    <br>I am thanking the man of God for what he has done, for taking away the burden from this head.
    <br>When you convert those dollars to Nigerian currency, you will know how much.
    <br>Thinking of how to get that money was a problem.
    <br>So, I am thanking the man of God for what he has done for our family.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ?
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>We have heard the voice of the family representative,
    <br>who has spoken on behalf of the family.
    <br>What is your condition now? Have you gone back to work fully? Tell us.
    <br>Yes, I am okay now. I have gone back to work; I started work last month.
    <br>I am okay now; I am fine.
    <br>I am a police officer working for the Nigeria Police Force as a sergeant.
    <br>My advice especially goes to the Nigerian Police.
    <br>We should put our trust in God; God alone will save.
    <br>[Singing in local Nigerian language]
    <br>Praise the Lord! Let us clap for Jesus.
    <br>What else? They say they have silver and gold not to offer,
    <br>but they have their praise to God Almighty to offer,
    <br>their thanks and their appreciation,
    <br>which they have just expressed through their testimony and a song.
    <br>Tell us briefly the meaning of the song you just sang,
    <br>because we didn't understand that language.
    <br>What God has done in my life, I have nothing to give Him other than praise.
    <br>Hallelujah! Glory be to God! We thank God.
    <br>Now that God has done that for you, we want to encourage you to stay in faith in Christ Jesus.
    <br>To make the Word of God the standard for your life, the standard for your family
    <br>and more testimonies will continue to come into this family, in Jesus' name.
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>- Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
