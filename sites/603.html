    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is no one like You - Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is no one like Him.
    <br>Who is like Him?
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Viewers, we salute your faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>I salute your faith, viewers all over the world.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It takes faith to please God and you are there by faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>Nothing and nothing...
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Last week we talked about - God is Spirit and His worshippers do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>We have to follow that trend.
    <br>THE HIDDEN TRUTH
    <br>The Book of John 16 from verse 1.
    <br>"All this I have told you so that you will not fall away."
    <br>That is the hidden truth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The hidden truth".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>"All this I have told you so that you will not fall away."
    <br>But when you take your time to read to the end, you will understand what Jesus is talking about.
    <br>"They will put you out of the synagogue;
    <br>in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you
    <br>will think they are offering a service to God."
    <br>Is it not happening now?
    <br>People put whatever they call it and blow themselves up, and say they are going to Heaven.
    <br>The Bible is a prophetic Word.
    <br>Holy men were carried along as they spoke the message that came from Heaven.
    <br>Can you see - it is a prophetic Word.
    <br>If you read with me, it says:
    <br>"... the time is coming when anyone who kills you
    <br>will think they are offering a service to God.
    <br>They will do such things because they have not known the Father..."
    <br>Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
    <br>Thy Kingdom come.
    <br>They will think they know Him but they don't.
    <br>You can only know Him by the Spirit of the Father because He is Spirit.
    <br>The Bible says God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>Let's go towards the end - verse 33.
    <br>" 'I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have peace.' "
    <br>That is, if you are not with God, you cannot have peace.
    <br>If you are not with Him, you cannot have peace.
    <br>In Him, you have peace; in this world, you will have trouble - trouble of all kinds.
    <br>" 'But take heart! I have overcome...' "
    <br>Take heart!
    <br>If you are not with Him, you will have trouble and such trouble will lead to death.
    <br>Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are out of touch.
    <br>You say the devil cannot touch you; he can touch you but cannot destroy you.
    <br>The touch of that devil will only strengthen your desire and determination for God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>"Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are out of touch."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are out of touch.]
    <br>"They cannot touch me" - this is the mistake we are making today.
    <br>This is why I call the message "The hidden truth".
    <br>That you are sick, you are thinking that you are not a Christian.
    <br>"Why should I be sick when I am a Christian?" - that is a big mistake.
    <br>A man can be sick in body, yet be a friend of God.
    <br>A man can be poor, yet be a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again:
    <br>"Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are out of touch."
    <br>A man can be poor or sick and yet be a favourite of Jesus Christ.
    <br>These are the mistakes we are making today.
    <br>The majority of us are spiritually blind, spiritually dull,
    <br>dull in comprehension, that is, understanding -
    <br>the unseen realm, absolutely closed to our spiritual vision.
    <br>We only see outward effects of the devil but we are blind to the spiritual cause.
    <br>God can often use anything, any foolish thing, to preserve us,
    <br>to strengthen our desire and determination,
    <br>to stop us for a while and rearrange us for the future.
    <br>We misjudge ourselves when we are in such circumstances as hardship.
    <br>"Why should I face this poverty, my friend?
    <br>I go to church regularly, I'm a true Christian, I'm baptized,
    <br>I have stopped smoking and drinking. Why all this hardship? Why and why?"
    <br>We misjudge ourselves when we are in such circumstances.
    <br>"Maybe I'm not a Christian; maybe I'm a sinner."
    <br>"Why is all this happening to me? Why sickness, why setback?
    <br>Look at my friends that are not Christians; they are drunkards; club-boy, club-girl, I see them everywhere.
    <br>They are making it, they are enjoying themselves."
    <br>Sin easily hides where there is no trial or temptation.
    <br>I mean, where there is no reaction of trial or tribulation.
    <br>Like many of us here today...
    <br>When there is no food on the table and no money in the pocket, we would likely not come to church.
    <br>"Jesus is the cause."
    <br>When there is food on the table and there is money in the pocket, "Jesus be blessed".
    <br>In times of prosperity and success, even a wicked man will seem generous and kind.
    <br>A wicked man will seem kind and generous in times of prosperity and success.
    <br>When there is no money in the pocket or food on the table, this will separate impurities.
    <br>Whatever your situation as a believer - all are for your obedience to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Whatever my situation as a believer - all are for my obedience to God".
    <br>They are not meant to kill you or to destroy you.
    <br>Your struggles should make you stronger if you are a Christian.
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>It is for your obedience to God.
    <br>We grow in character through obedience.
    <br>Open your Bible to the Book of Hebrew 5:8.
    <br>Though Jesus was a Son, a Son of God, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.
    <br>He was rejected.
    <br>Are you talking of slanderous remarks?
    <br>"If you say You are the Son of God, come down from the cross! You! You!"
    <br>Name calling.
    <br>Oftentimes, we run from the things that will strengthen our lives.
    <br>We run from the very things that will bring strength to our lives,
    <br>such as pain and trials of all kinds.
    <br>They are things that bring strength to our lives.
    <br>And what are those things?
    <br>Things like trials, temptations, persecutions, name calling, those foolish things.
    <br>When you know this is a trial, you will do anything to avoid it.
    <br>In other words: As a Christian, they are things that bring strength.
    <br>When you dodge it, you are postponing the evil day.
    <br>You will meet it tomorrow, somewhere.
    <br>You see trial is coming and it is destined because you need to know, you need to see,
    <br>because we are spiritually blind, spiritually dull, dull in comprehension.
    <br>When you dodge it, you are postponing the evil day.
    <br>These are the things many of us are facing today.
    <br>Those things you would have faced at a younger age,
    <br>those troubles you would have encountered when you were very young.
    <br>You dodge it; you have ability, power, you have everything, connections - you dodge it.
    <br>You avoid them - they are the ones you are facing today.
    <br>You can't avoid it, you are postponing them.
    <br>Don't make the mistake of thinking you are out of touch.
    <br>"Because I'm a Christian, because I'm this..."
    <br>You think you are a Christian, you are living right...
    <br>The righteousness you are talking about is a gift.
    <br>It is not the work of righteousness, it is not what you work for, what you labour for, what you study or learn.
    <br>We grow in character through obedience.
    <br>Physical growth is a function of time.
    <br>Intellectual growth is a function of learning.
    <br>Spiritual growth is a function of obedience to God's will.
    <br>Don't misjudge yourself when you are in such circumstances as failure, disappointment, sickness.
    <br>Don't begin to ask, "Am I not a Christian? Why should all these things happen to me?
    <br>Look at these people that are making it. They do not live right."
    <br>How do you know you are living right when living right is not what we work for?
    <br>It is a gift of God.
    <br>You say, "I'm living right. I stopped smoking."
    <br>How do you know? Who will stopp you from smoking?
    <br>- Do you have the power to stop yourself?
    <br>- [No!]
    <br>It is grace.
    <br>When you say you are living right, it is a gift from God, it is not what we work for.
    <br>It is what you work for, you can boast of.
    <br>When you work for something, "No, I worked for this" - you fight for it, by merit.
    <br>"No, I read, I must make it" - you fight for it.
    <br>But in this case, our life is grace.
    <br>What is happening to you cannot take your position as a child of God.
    <br>Don't judge your Christian life by your situation.
    <br>"No. This thing is too much. I'm not a Christian." - How do you know?
    <br>Because of what you are facing you are not a Christian?
    <br>Because of what is happening to you, you are not a Christian?
    <br>Because of what you are facing, because of the situation you are in, you are not a Christian?
    <br>Don't allow your situation to rule you.
    <br>God refines us with situations like that.
    <br>The reaction of your situation on you separates impurities.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The reaction of my situation on me separates impurities
    <br>and allows the character of God to grow in my life."
    <br>THE HIDDEN TRUTH | T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Your situation cannot say you are not a Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My situation cannot say I am not a Christian".
    <br>My situation cannot determine my Christian life.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[My situation cannot determine my Christian life.]
    <br>My situation separates impurities and allows the character of God to grow in my life.
    <br>THE HIDDEN TRUTH | T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>So the question that...
    <br>"Because of my situation... I don't know whether I'm a Christian.
    <br>I don't know why all this is happening to me..."
    <br>While are you saying it, it is discouraging your journey as a Christian.
    <br>You are judging yourself - misjudging.
    <br>Whereas you are a Christian but because of your situation you are now thinking,
    <br>"Am I a Christian? What is wrong? I don't know whether I'm a Christian.
    <br>Why all this should happen to me?"
    <br>The Holy Spirit needs a free spirit.
    <br>When you are thinking, "Am I a Christian?", your spirit is in bondage.
    <br>Your spirit must be free to attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>If your spirit is not free, you cannot attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>You cannot have anything to do with God; you cannot even pray.
    <br>You need a free spirit.
    <br>"Am I a Christian? Why all this should happen to me?
    <br>Why all this setback? Why all this, that...?"
    <br>That is not from a free spirit.
    <br>The Bible says no temptation can seize you except the temptation that is common to man.
    <br>Stop misjudging yourself - tell your neighbour.
    <br>- I cannot hear you.
    <br>- [Stop misjudging yourself.]
    <br>This is the trap of satan - a common trick satan is using today.
    <br>Because Jesus is coming very very soon, on the last day,
    <br>satan is now coming with a common trick.
    <br>When he gives you sickness, that sickness will tell you, "You are not a Christian".
    <br>You too will accept; you will start walking in the ways of unbelievers because of the voice.
    <br>Something says you are not a Christian and you accept you are not a Christian,
    <br>why do you still want to live a Christian life?
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Disappointment keeps telling you, "Can you see?
    <br>See, your friend is going well, the business is going well.
    <br>You see disappointment. You say you are a Christian.
    <br>You are not a Christian!" - you too agree, "Yes, it is true; I'm not a Christian."
    <br>This is a common trick of satan.
    <br>You sleep in the night, you have a nightmare;
    <br>somebody comes to embarrass you, you find it very embarrassing.
    <br>By the time you wake up, you refuse to pray, "What about the one I offered yesterday?
    <br>It gave me nightmare.
    <br>The prayer I offered yesterday gave me nightmare. Which kind of prayer again?
    <br>I have been fasting for the past three days; the last day I'm supposed to hear from God -
    <br>look at the embarrassment."
    <br>Stop misjudging yourself because you are disappointed.
    <br>Why are you thinking that you are out of touch
    <br>when the Bible says in this world, there will be trouble?
    <br>Are you not in the world?
    <br>Jesus said to His disciples, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>That shows there will be something that will challenge your faith.
    <br>THE HIDDEN TRUTH | T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>He said to His disciples, 'I pray that your faith will not fail - you will not abandon Me'.
    <br>That is what He is saying, 'I pray you will not abandon Me'.
    <br>It shows that something is coming that will tempt you to renounce Him,
    <br>to say, "I am not a Christian".
    <br>They can only touch you; they cannot destroy you.
    <br>Sickness will come to touch you; affliction will come to touch you.
    <br>Temptation will come to touch you; trials of any kind will come to touch you
    <br>but cannot impair you.
    <br>They can only separate impurities and allow the character of God in your life to grow.
    <br>THE HIDDEN TRUTH | T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>A true Christian is tested by his ability to face situations.
    <br>That is a true Christian.
    <br>It is like somebody who goes to school, from secondary school to university without examination.
    <br>How will you be promoted?
    <br>When you go to school without examination, will you be promoted?
    <br>Trials and temptations are a test to promote you.
    <br>THE HIDDEN TRUTH | T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Your faith life needs to be tested.
    <br>To test you, all these foolish things are the examination.
    <br>You can never live and be out of touch.
    <br>You will be touched; sickness will touch you,
    <br>trial of any kind will touch you,
    <br>affliction will touch you.
    <br>It can only touch you - just touch.
    <br>That touch is to separate impurities and allow the character of God in your life to grow.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I want to offer prayer for you.
    <br>Jesus, give them a hearing heart -
    <br>a heart to obey this Word, a heart to do what the Word says, in Jesus' name.
    <br>That is my prayer for you.
