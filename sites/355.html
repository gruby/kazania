  <h3>
    355 - T.B. Joshua's Secrets REVEALED!!!
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>I believe each one of us should challenge ourselves to go in the level that Prophet T.B Joshua is flowing.
    <br>In my congregation, I have had guests
    <br>from Columbia and other countries.
    <br>We have received guests from other nations, from Columbia and other nations of the world in our church.
    <br>But it is the very first time
    <br>in our ministerial lives
    <br>that we have picked up the guest from the 
    <br>airport and not taken them to a hotel.
    <br>Instead, we took him from the airport
    <br>to a prayer mountain.
    <br>It is the very first time
    <br>in my ministerial life,
    <br>that I have seen such a thing.
    <br>We took Prophet T.B Joshua to a mountain 
    <br>because he asked to stay in a mountain.
    <br>We did not take him to a hotel.
    <br>We took him to a mountain.
    <br>I am shocked, it is something new for me.
    <br>It immediately reminded me of the Prophet Elijah.
    <br>When they couldn't find him, they found him in the mountains.
    <br>It also made me remember John the Baptist.
    <br>He dressed very humbly, and he lived very far in the mountains.
    <br>I believe that his own life 
    <br>gives us a message.
    <br>We, as pastors, find ourselves in a 
    <br>lot of activities in our lives,
    <br>and sometimes we abandon what we should never abandon -
    <br>our primary relationship is the Lord and us.
    <br>Columbia Pastor's Conference
    <br>with Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>We assigned bodyguards to the Prophet, but he did not want them.
    <br>In these days, we understand why he did not need them.
    <br>He came one day
    <br>and the next day at 3 am in the morning.
    <br>He was in the mountain, but he climbed to a higher place in the mountain at 3 am in the morning.
    <br>The bodyguards had to climb to the higher place at that time in the cold.
    <br>The bodyguards were asking,
    <br>"What's wrong with the prophet?"
    <br>"He is gong to make us ill!"
    <br>His lifestyle is very different
    <br>from the majority of us.
    <br>Maybe I am revealing a secret.
    <br>It is good for us as pastors to know what I am saying.
    <br>Let us find our own mountain, a place of prayer.
    <br>Let us find our exclusive
    <br>time with the Lord,
    <br>where there are no commercials,
    <br>interruptions, and nothing to disturb us.
    <br>Can you say with me, "I want my mountain!"
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "We need to have 
    <br>our own mountain of prayer."
    <br>Glory to the Lord!
    <br>I have a lot of expectations today,
    <br>but I know that according to the desire of your heart,
    <br>you will receive from the Lord
    <br>by His Holy Spirit
    <br>through his Prophet.
    <br>How many of you will say "Amen"?
    <br>Give an applause and give the glory to God.
