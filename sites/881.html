  <p>    
    <br>Africa!
    <br>Tell you neighbour: Africa!
    <br>You don't regard and you don't respect your own.
    <br>I said, you don't regard and you don't respect your own.
    <br>I'm writing a book: "Africa, stop begging outside Africa".
    <br>We are beggars!
    <br>You never believe that you can go outside the country and bless them with the little you have
    <br>but you want to collect from them; this is why we are what we are - beggars.
    <br>I want to share with you one of my big secrets: All these crusades you see me doing all over the world -
    <br>Singapore, Indonesia, those big countries -
    <br>I pay 99% of the money.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we are invited to crusade in America, Singapore,
    <br>I would say, "How much is the stadium?"
    <br>If the stadium is $100,000, I would say, "Do you have any area you want to support?"
    <br>They would say, "We are going to rent it". I would say, "No, you can't rent it for me.
    <br>For reasons known to me, we don't control the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Let me pray for whom God wants me to pray for.
    <br>Don't pay and start bringing your brother, sister, cousin or business man for prayer.
    <br>If you pay for the stadium for me, and you invite me for crusade,
    <br>you'll collect money from big business men that are sick, and those are the ones you will arrange in the front for prayer.
    <br>And you will now be telling me, "Pray for this person, don't pray for this person.
    <br>Don't pray for this one; this one - pray for him.
    <br>You have not prayed for this one, Man of God. He's the one that has payed 70% of the money.
    <br>God cannot cooperate or support such an arrangement.
    <br>Or you would be telling me that I should come out at 8 am,
    <br>when the Spirit of God is telling me I should come out at 10 am".
    <br>My accommodation - I don't let them know where I'm going to lodge.
    <br>After the crusade you can know where I'm living
    <br>but before or during the crusade I will not allow you to come to me.
    <br>You organiser, you cannot see me until after the crusade.
    <br>On the last day of the crusade I' would call them, "Follow me home.
    <br>I'm sorry for not showing you where I'm living".
    <br>I will enter your country with money,
    <br>and I will go out of the country and not take your money out of the country.
    <br>It's the rule and regulation because the grace is not for sale.
    <br>My joy is to see people healed, blessed and delivered; that is my money.
    <br>Each person that is delivered is more than $20,000.
    <br>Okay, imagine - in each crusade, almost 500 people get delivered.
    <br>500 times $20,000 - that is the money God is giving me.
    <br>$20,000 times 500.
    <br>You know that it is a huge amount of money, which is more than this money you are talking about.
    <br>The joy to sleep, joy.
    <br>You need to know what it means if God uses you to heal people.
    <br>If you knew what it means if God uses you to deliver people, you would want to deliver people all the time.
    <br>If you knew the joy in using you to deliver people,
    <br>you would never ask the people you deliver to bring kobo or money.
    <br>Anything. Even when they give you, you beg them, "Please, don't destroy my life!"
    <br>If you know what it is, brother, stand up. You are from where?
    <br>Zambia.
    <br>If you know what it is to set you free...
    <br>You are now here with a situation from Zambia.
    <br>If you know what it is to set you free from your problem...
    <br>Ha!
    <br>It's more than trillion dollars! Only you!
    <br>So if you know what it is to set people free, you would never...
    <br>Even after you have set a person free, don't wait for the person to greet you "thank you".
    <br>This "thank you", you don't need it. This is why after praying for you, I leave you.
    <br>I don't want you to say "thank you, sir".
    <br>I don't want that because God has given me something more than "thank you, sir".
    <br>I don't want anything to affect that "thank you, sir".
    <br>If God uses you to remove the pain of one, you are more than a millionaire.
    <br>You people believe that your reward is money.
    <br>No!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you know what it means to do something and collect money,
    <br>and that money is your gain,
    <br>you are robbing yourself.
    <br>Something insufficient and that money is what?
    <br>Insufficient! It cannot help you, it cannot give you peace.
    <br>Money can't give you peace; if money can give you peace, many of you would not be here today.
    <br>This is why you just see me at Ikotun Egbe since I started.
    <br>Branch - hmm.
    <br>From Ikotun Egbe to where? Look at glory of God.
    <br>Expansion of the grace can be dangerous if you are not careful.
    <br>If God gives you one dollar and that one dollar increases to 100 dollars,
    <br>it could be very dangerous.
    <br>That is why when the grace of God expands, you too have to be very careful.
    <br>Contain it. If you are no ready, hold it; you can know if you are not ready.
    <br>Like many of us - you do little business, millions of dollars enter your pocket.
    <br>Because you have millions of dollars, you establish many companies.
    <br>Will you be able to contain it, will you be able to hold it, will you be able to have power over this company?
    <br>Or you ministers of God - God called you as a minister, and you start.
    <br>You are gifted with message - powerful message.
    <br>When you are talking, people cry.
    <br>A lot of people keep trooping to your church.
    <br>Because of that, you suddenly anoint this one.
    <br>Stand up - you suddenly anoint this one because your church is growing.
    <br>Anoint this one - your church is growing - a big church.
    <br>Right. Okay, you go to Zambia.
    <br>Go and establish one.
    <br>You - go to Cotonou.
    <br>Go to London.
    <br>Go to America.
    <br>It could be dangerous.
    <br>Because of expansion.
    <br>You can't contain it.
    <br>If you know the expansion is becoming (big)...
    <br>That is it.
    <br>You may be seated, sir.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I started, the ministry was booming.
    <br>Branches here, branches there.
    <br>I just said, Please, can you close that branch for God's sake
    <br>because I know I would not be able to stand, even though there's great power".
    <br>But the human side of me -
    <br>I have no anointing to give you; it is God who anoints.
    <br>Suddenly in a hurry, because the church has grown, I anoint you.
    <br>Maturity needs time and experience.
    <br>No matter the mighty power God gives to you, you need to mature over time.
    <br>You can go up and come down again.
    <br>This is what has happened to many of us here -
    <br>you were up there one time but now you start again from here.
    <br>What kind of life is that? Why can't you take it easy
    <br>and go up in a season,
    <br>by obeying season - dry season, rain season.
    <br>Just go up by season.
    <br>But you go up and down again.
    <br>We serve God with our life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: We serve God with our life.
    <br>But you believe you serve God with the Bible.
    <br>You read the Bible and you serve God with the Bible - "Jesus said this, Jesus said that".
    <br>You have forgotten your life.
    <br>You have to serve God with your life, not only with the Bible.
    <br>That's what the Bible says.
    <br>You seem to forget to serve God with your life.
    <br>Do you know that your life preaches better than your mouth?
    <br>If you are telling me, "Jesus is Lord. Jesus is Lord. Jesus is Lord" -
    <br>that one is not strong enough; let your life say it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I stand here and begin to tell you, "Jesus is Lord", "Jesus is Saviour", "Jesus is this", "Jesus is that"...
    <br>But your life can preach better - your life; mere looking at your life.
    <br>It can preach better.
    <br>A better sermon. Say, "My life can preach a better sermon".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>My life can preach a better sermon.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>My life can preach a better sermon.
    <br>So does your life preach? It is your mouth that preaches, not your life.
    <br>Look at me - without even talking.
    <br>If you just walk out and say, "Ok, who is this man?" You go on YouTube.
    <br>Look - I travelled to Israel. I was telling you people
    <br>that they were telling me I should not talk, that they know me.
    <br>They were telling me what I'm doing and they could see...
    <br>This is what they were talking about in Nazareth, Capernaum and all others.
    <br>I was glad; I was looking at them.
    <br>So that is my life. I didn't preach this time; my life preached to them.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>What you have just seen -
    <br>whatever decision of God, I have no life of mine.
    <br>If the Lord says yes, who am I to say no?
    <br>God has a purpose of sending me to your midst.
    <br>There's a purpose for sending me to your midst.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>At the same time, there's a purpose of taking me to Israel.
    <br>Maybe God wants you to appreciate me and God of T.B. Joshua better.
    <br>By the time you want to see me, you have to pay for a ticket to fly to Israel.
    <br>I'm going there to see.
    <br>You will appreciate it better.
    <br>And you know, right from the beginning of this ministry,
    <br>it is the ministry that is the most persecuted in the world.
    <br>The most persecuted ministry.
    <br>Who are the people persecuting the ministry?
    <br>My people - Africa.
    <br>I take it back again.
    <br>This ministry is the most persecuted ministry in the world.
    <br>There's no name my people have not called,
    <br>and there's nothing they have not done.
    <br>Strange thing!
    <br>Who are the people?
    <br>My people - Africa!
    <br>It has not been an easy thing, if not God.
    <br>That is why I choose to live a lonely life.
    <br>If you want to see me, come to this church.
    <br>I don't go out; that is a lonely life.
    <br>It has not been easy because I don't know who is a friend and who is an enemy.
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>I would have loved to come to your wedding, your ceremony,
    <br>inviting me, sitting at the table, eating rice and chicken.
    <br>But I don't trust anyone anymore,
    <br>talkless of eating in your house.
    <br>But yet, I'm always in your midst; right from the beginning of the ministry.
    <br>Since thirty years of the ministry, I have always been with you people.
    <br>If I go for revival, after the revival, I come back.
    <br>I don't miss you peopie; I love you people.
    <br>Upon the prosecution and hatred, I decided to love you, to take the path of love.
    <br>You show hatred; I show love.
    <br>But I want to say something: I love you so much.
    <br>And I will always stand for the path of love.
    <br>Anytime you pray, remember Africa in prayer.
    <br>Many heroes, many great people - they have chased them out of Africa.
    <br>What has happened to me right from the beginning of this ministry is enough to chase me out of this country.
    <br>What has happened to me has never happened to any minister of God in this world.
    <br>Mention any minister of God it has happened to.
    <br>No.
    <br>In this world, no minister of God.
    <br>But I'm still in your midst.
    <br>There were enough to chase me out of Nigeria, Africa.
    <br>But I will go for revivals, and at the revivals, you will always see the stadium full.
    <br>The country, ministers - all of them gather.
    <br>But I am not carried away by that; after the crusade - back home.
    <br>Back to Africa where I am being persecuted,
    <br>where they want me to be killed, destroyed.
    <br>I live where I am not celebrated; I left the place where I am celebrated.
    <br>I'm celebrated all over the world but I left the place.
    <br>I'm living where I am not celebrated.
    <br>I want to pray with you. You put this thing behind you so we can move forward.
    <br>I'm only expressing the happening, the journey so far.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Bow down your head and ask God to give you a hearing heart, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Ask God to give you strength, so you will not give up.
    <br>Don't give up
    <br>Where you are not celebrated is the best place to stay, to get strength.
    <br>When you are in the midst of battle, you are building yourself; it's good.
    <br>Where you are not celebrated, where you are being persecuted is the best place for you to live.
    <br>It will build vou; all this will build you.
    <br>Gold cannot be gold without passing through the furnace.
    <br>Human character too needs to pass through the furnace.
    <br>That is why I decided to stay where I'm not celebrated - here in Nigeria, here in Africa.
    <br>I stayed there to build the grace of God.
    <br>When the grace of God is in the midst of challenges,  it gets stronger.
    <br>So that is why I stayed in your midst.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace to stay where you are not celebrated.
