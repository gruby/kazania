    <br>Right now, whatever satan might have used, in whichever way,
    <br>to connect you to himself - immorality, weaknesses, bad habits,
    <br>whatever situation you are facing,
    <br>these are things satan uses to connect us to himself.
    <br>This is what we want to fight against now.
    <br>Remember, the word you are about to speak is not yours.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to disconnect yourself.

    <br>Whatever demon, evil spirit in your life - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever atom, whatever trace of demon, evil spirit - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever evil spirit, demon - in the name of Jesus, out!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Remain silent.
    <br>I want you to face your neighbour and hold your neighbour's hand.
    <br>Face your neighbour.
    <br>Whatever satan, demon, might have used to connect you to himself -
    <br>be disconnected!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Every constant experience you are having of that bondage - be loosed!
    <br>Be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every constant experience - it could be sickness, disease
    <br>affliction, hardship, poverty - be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to loose it.
    <br>Every constant experience you are having of that bondage - it could be sickness,
    <br>affliction, disease, hardship.
