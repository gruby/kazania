  </h3>
  <p>    
    <br>My name is Nthabeleng Paulette - 26 years old, from Lesotho.
    <br>Who are the people sitting next to you?
    <br>My aunt and uncle.
    <br>I'm a student, I still haven't completed.
    <br>What are you studying?
    <br>Property studies, valuation and quantity surveying,
    <br>at Namibian University of Science and Technology.
    <br>I have a connective tissue disorder called, ehlers-danlos syndrome,
    <br>which means that I have complications with all of my connective tissues;
    <br>all the organs, joints and tissues in my body can fail at any given time.
    <br>All my joints get dislocated.
    <br>My heart, liver, kidneys, bladder and muscles cannot work.
    <br>I can’t really walk sometimes because I get paralyzed at times.
    <br>Even my eyes dislocate, so I can’t see well; studying for me is very hard.
    <br>I have been out of school many times because of these attacks.
    <br>I haven’t finished school, even though I have been studying for over seven years.
    <br>I can’t do things that others can do – I can’t stand for long or walk.
    <br>I am aided with a wheelchair at times; sometimes I need arm, leg, back or shoulder guards.
    <br>Three to four of my joints get dislocated every day.
    <br>My breathing is also bad.
    <br>I have seizures frequently but it is not epilepsy.
    <br>My lungs are very weak, they cannot compress air so, I cannot breathe very well;
    <br>I have shortness of breath.
    <br>I cannot sing or dance for long; I cannot do any activity or run.
    <br>I have to walk and hold onto something, if I am walking but most of the time I just sit.
    <br>I have had this condition for close to 14 years.
    <br>I have visited almost every doctor in South Africa.
    <br>I have been to Lesotho, Botswana, I even visited doctors in Austria
    <br>and Germany but nobody could help, as nobody understood what I had.
    <br>I see therapists every day -
    <br>I have a bi-connectisist, a chiropractor and a physiotherapist who help me on a daily basis.
    <br>I do hydro-therapy to help my muscles but it doesn’t really help.
    <br>If I don’t do these things, I can’t do anything by myself.
    <br>Doctors have no solution for me except to keep my muscles as fit as possible.
    <br>But none of them can really help me because they do not know what causes these attacks.
    <br>I can have an attack where only the heart is having a problem.
    <br>Sometimes, everything doesn’t work at the same time.
    <br>So, the doctors and specialists don’t understand how to help me;
    <br>they help the symptoms, not the condition.
    <br>I have a lot of dislocations of the shoulder and elbow frequently.
    <br>I have to carry my brace with me to protect my arm in case it comes out.
    <br>If it is out, I have to relocate it and when it is out, it hurts.
    <br>The brace carries my shoulder.
    <br>I cannot carry heavy things at all; if I carry something, it will just pull out
    <br>and when I’m sleeping, it dislocates as well.
    <br>I have very flexible connective tissue, unlike normal people.
    <br>So, my joints get out of place easily.
    <br>As you can see, my finger bends right over – most people can’t do this.
    <br>I got to know about The SCOAN years ago from Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Years ago, my parents were watching and they called me to join them.
    <br>I have seen a lot of people being delivered, especially people with joint issues such as myself.
    <br>I have seen people who have not been walking, walk.
    <br>People who haven’t been able to use their limbs, use their limbs.
    <br>Therefore, I believe I can also be normal and walk like everybody else.
    <br>I believe Jesus will heal me and I will be normal; I will resume my studies
    <br>and I will be like everybody else and have a career.
    <br>I want to live life without pain because I am always in pain – 24/7.
    <br>I pray with you that the Lord Jesus Christ will use His able servant, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>to declare you free from these problems, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Help me, Man of God; I have a genetic condition that makes my body non-functional.
    <br>I dislocate all the time.
    <br>Now, I dislocated about 5 times; my knee was out, my shoulder was out, and my jaws were out.
    <br>I can't go to school, I can't do any thing what everybody else does.
    <br>Everything doesn't work; my heart is weak, my lungs are weak.
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Alright, remove it.
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Just stand up and look at me!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>Nthabeleng Ramoedi.
    <br>Walk majestically!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus - I'm healed!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Hello everybody, my name is Nthabeleng Ramoedi from Lesotho.
    <br>I came here because I had ehlers-danlos syndrome -
    <br>a connective tissue that affects every single muscle joint and organ in one's body.
    <br>I couldn't do anything everyone else could do.
    <br>My joints dislocated multiple times; they could pop out at any time, even when I was sleeping.
    <br>I was out of school half of the time, so I haven't even completed my studies,
    <br>even though I have been studying for 8 years.
    <br>I came here with a hope that I would be normal again, and thank God I'm walking,
    <br>which is actually not very normal for me to be walking.
    <br>Or alone talking, having a shortness of breath.
    <br>Usually, I wouldn't say more than 5 sentences; then, I wouldn't be able to breath.
    <br>I would need to have an asthma pump or something to help me breathe.
    <br>But, for the grace of God, since last week Sunday, when the man of God administered healing on me,
    <br>I became a different person, lighter and something...
    <br>OK, just before you explain further, we really want to understand;
    <br>we watched in the clip how you were explaining more about the severity of this condition.
    <br>Can you just once again, for the benefit of those present here and viewers -
    <br>can you just explain what was actually happening in your body, before you received prayer?
    <br>What was the challenge you were having; the pain you were having in your body - just describe to us more.
    <br>The pain I was having; think of walking every single day with about 10 breaks of every joint.
    <br>There was a constant pain that I had every single day.
    <br>Talking was massively painful because my jaws would pop out every time.
    <br>I couldn't eat anything, because if I ate, I couldn't digest - my intestines would twist around,
    <br>and I would look like pregnant half of the time.
    <br>Doctors couldn't help me whatsoever.
    <br>I couldn't see properly because my eyes would dislocate, so writing was a mission.
    <br>I wouldn't be able to read anything; even the Bible - I would hold the Bible for 2 minutes,
    <br>then things would start moving, and I couldn't see letters at all.
    <br>My life was constrained in a deep belittling state, constantly - 24/7.
    <br>I've probably been to more specialists than one human being should.
    <br>I know all sorts of...
    <br>I used to see cardiologists,
    <br>physiotherapists,
    <br>joints specialists, bones specialists, brain specialists, because nothing worked
    <br>and none of them could help me at all.
    <br>They would only help to stabilize me, so I would be able to at least receive medications.
    <br>But sometimes my body even rejected the medications they gave me.
    <br>So nothing actually worked.
    <br>The only thing that kept me going was that if they worked with my muscles,
    <br>it made them stronger, so I could take 10 steps instead of 3 steps.
    <br>Or, I could be able to breathe longer than I usually did by using a nebulizer or some sort of machine.
    <br>Especially in winters - for some weird reason, I would constantly be in the emergency room,
    <br>every other week or every other day.
    <br>How many diseases did the doctors actually diagnose in your body, as a result of this tissue disorder?
    <br>So far, I think I was in the range of between 60 and 70 conditions and diseases.
    <br>I could relate to almost everyone in the hospital who came through.
    <br>If you had diabetes, I had it,
    <br>if you had some sort of ulcer or intestinal issue, I had it,
    <br>if you had any sort of seizure, I've had it before.
    <br>So pretty much, I had every little problem you could think of.
    <br>We are listening to our sister; she said that medically, because of this very rare disorder she had,
    <br>the doctors actually diagnosed more than 60 to 70  different diseases in her system,
    <br>because of the abnormality she had as a result of this condition.
    <br>Just tell us, sister, you said that at any given time your joints would dislocate;
    <br>your shoulder, your knees, your arm -
    <br>just describe what would happen each time your shoulder or other part of your body would dislocate.
    <br>What would you have to do to try to fix the situation?
    <br>What was the kind of pain you would have at that moment?
    <br>Well, I don't know if anyone of you has broken a bone before, falling from a building or during an accident,
    <br>but it feels like you are crushing a bone every time something is dislocated.
    <br>There are two options: Most times, I would have to be rushed to the emergence room,
    <br>so the doctor could relocate a joint.
    <br>They always had to put me under heavy medication before they could put it back in,
    <br>because they were traumatising a lot of muscles around the joint, if it came out.
    <br>With time, because it became a part of my life, I learned how to put back some of the joints;
    <br>like the jaw one was a bit easier for me to put back,
    <br>or I would ask any other individual around me, and tell them how to move around,
    <br>by directing their hand, or something, so that they could put it back.
    <br>But normally, it was always an emergency to go to the doctor.
    <br>We are hearing what our sister is saying that on every day she would find a situation,
    <br>whereby a part of her body would actually dislocate,
    <br>and the pain she would experience would be as if she had broken a bone in her body.
    <br>If anyone has experienced that, you would know the magnitude of the pain involved.
    <br>She came to the point where she herself would physically start putting the parts of her body
    <br>that were dislocated back to the right position,
    <br>because she was so accustomed to the different parts of her body dislocating,
    <br>or, she would find someone nearby and instruct them how to actually put that part of her body back,
    <br>to the correct position, because of the nature of that problem.
    <br>You mean to say sister, this is how you have been living your life for many years, in that intense pain and agony?
    <br>Yes, that is exactly how I have been living.
    <br>For example, I think the worst kind of dislocation that I experienced is a rib cage coming completely out.
    <br>If anybody has had a fracture of a rib, or had it bruised for some reason, due to sports injury,
    <br>he would know that it is probably the worst bone to get fractured at any point.
    <br>It is massively...
    <br>It feels like you are dying, pretty much.
    <br>I don't know what death feels like, but I feel like that's probably the worst type of pain anybody can feel.
    <br>And the hip as well.
    <br>Anybody with a hip replacement - usually old people would sympathize because they understand how it feels,
    <br>but I felt all that agony pain at the early age of 12.
    <br>So, pretty much, I have been feeling pain through all my life,
    <br>which is why this is very weird - I have never felt like this before.
    <br>We are still going to come to how our sister received her healing,
    <br>but we are just asking these questions, so that our viewers around the world, and those present here
    <br>can know the power of God, that we are under, by the grace of God - here, in the arena of liberty.
    <br>Now, sister, you said that because of this constant pain,
    <br>just describe - were you able to live a normal kind of a childhood,
    <br>like for example with your going to school, or the kind of activities other young children would do?
    <br>How did this condition really affect you to separate you from the crowd,
    <br>in the sense that you couldn't do what others in school were doing?
    <br>I couldn't do sports for example, or go on tours if something were to happen at school.
    <br>I would always be conformed to a classroom.
    <br>Even in the classroom itself, I would always be...
    <br>Every week there was a mystery that an ambulance was going to come
    <br>and I would have to go to the emergency room.
    <br>So much that when there was an ambulance around the school,
    <br>people seeing me walking or sitting would say, "Oh, it wasn't you? We thought it was you again".
    <br>I was so accustomed to always being pulled out of school that it was a part of me.
    <br>I didn't do any activity, because if I tried to jump over something, I would break something,
    <br>if I tried to write something in class, I would write two sentences,
    <br>then my arm would dislocate, so it wouldn't really work.
    <br>Even exams; they were trying to figure out how to make me write exams,
    <br>without me actually having to be in pain.
    <br>Most of my final high-school exams, I wrote them with my left hand.
    <br>By the grace of God, I don't know how, I still passed anyway.
    <br>Sister, we also want you to describe; you said that it reached a point where you couldn't even sleep,
    <br>because of the severity of this pain.
    <br>Can you just describe what would happen to you in the night?
    <br>What was a normal night like for you because of this?
    <br>Most people probably know what insomnia is - think of it as being constant.
    <br>When doctors would do sleep-test on me to see my neurological balance,
    <br>one neurologist told me that it seems as if I haven't slept in over 3 years.
    <br>Because my brain is always working, the chemicals in the brain were never balanced, so I was never asleep.
    <br>I would close my eyes in the midst of hoping to sleep, but I would just toss and turn the whole time
    <br>or be up because my bladder was always full, even though I peed
    <br>like a teaspoon of pee, but I would always have to rush to the bathroom.
    <br>So, I never really slept.
    <br>Because of that, throughout the day you would be tired, in whatever you would do.
    <br>You would easily just find yourself sleeping off, because you hadn't actually slept in the night?
    <br>True.
    <br>Half of my classes I would have my head on the desk.
    <br>Some lecturers thought I was just an annoying child because I never really spoke about my condition.
    <br>In a classroom of 400 students - who cares?
    <br>You are just there to do your work and therefore you have to stand up,
    <br>but people would just be like, "Why do you always rest your head on the table?",
    <br>or "Why can't you sit up straight like everybody else?"
    <br>Because of my fracture on the back of my spine, it literally curved in, so I couldn't stand up straight;
    <br>in fact even standing straight like this was not a normal thing for me - I would have to slouch back,
    <br>because my spine couldn't stand up straight.
    <br>We saw in the interview - we can actually see on the board here;
    <br>there were some pictures that were displayed, showing you in some unusual positions.
    <br>Could you just describe to us again, for the benefit of our viewers,
    <br>why we are seeing these pictures, and what your body condition was like before?
    <br>For example, this particular picture shows that I was hyper flexible,
    <br>meaning that when your body stops at a certain fraction, mine "over-moved" - it was extensively bendy.
    <br>Most people with this condition don't pick it up until when they try to move, something pops out.
    <br>When you are a kid, it is not easy to detect; they just thought I was a flexible child -
    <br>maybe I was going to join the circus, or something.
    <br>But then, as I grew older, I was supposed to be stiffer, but it didn't get stiff at all.
    <br>It just got lax and lax.
    <br>I could fit in a box, if you wanted to put me in there.
    <br>There was nothing holding my joints in place, so things would just pop out all the time.
    <br>This particular picture shows that I was usually under some sort of machine constantly to help me breath,
    <br>because my breathing was really bad.
    <br>This is one of my best friends, from the past obviously, not anymore - my sling.
    <br>It would always have to be in one of my school bags, even if I left the house with no dislocation,
    <br>because chances were that the day would not end without something popping out.
    <br>And if I left it hanging, it would hurt longer.
    <br>This was to support so that nobody touched or bumped me by mistake,
    <br>not knowing that it hurt or went out.
    <br>These are my knee guards, different types.
    <br>The other one is metal-based, because there was always liquid transforming from my spine to my knee,
    <br>so my knee would just swell up with a lot of liquid.
    <br>They couldn't drain it because if you opened any part of my body, I would bleed non-stop.
    <br>So, operations were never advised, because every time I was opened, something was going to happen,
    <br>therefore I was just "bleed-dry".
    <br>In conclusion, this was a miserable way to live.
    <br>I couldn't go out, I have not done anything teenagers do;
    <br>I just read about it, or hear about it from my sisters; like they went out to a concert -
    <br>even a gospel concert, I've never done that.
    <br>Every time the weather changed from hot to cold, from evening to night, I reacted and got sick.
    <br>If I were to move out of the room with air conditioning, and it was hot outside, I would probably faint.
    <br>Viewers around the world, we have listened to our sister.
    <br>This is the severity of this very rare condition that she had when she came in.
    <br>Just tell us sister - how rare is this condition that you were having in your body?
    <br>Are you aware of how many people around the world have this kind of condition?
    <br>It's extensively rare.
    <br>Even in the countries where we think medicine is widely more exposed than down here in Africa,
    <br>only about 10% of the whole population is diagnosed.
    <br>And only 1 person in 100 000 might have it - that is how rare it is,
    <br>but no one knows what to do about it.
    <br>It takes years for most people to get diagnosed.
    <br>Even a doctor herself, who did research, only discovered in her fifties that she had this sickness,
    <br>and she was a practising doctor for more than 10 years.
    <br>We thank God that in the midst of this very extreme condition, God brought you to The SCOAN.
    <br>We saw on the clip earlier, when you cried out for prayer, as the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua passed by, and he began to pray for you.
    <br>We just want you to describe to us, at that moment, can you just relive what happened,
    <br>as the Prophet began to pray for you?
    <br>When the Prophet came over, for some reason I couldn't talk for the first couple of seconds.
    <br>Then I don't know what happened afterwards.
    <br>I remember being on the floor and I was shaking uncontrollably - I don't know the reasons.
    <br>The next thing I heard was him telling me to look him in the eyes -
    <br>the eyes were a bit weary, so it took a while.
    <br>After I looked at him straight up and I was standing,
    <br>I felt some sort of relief; as if I became 10 times lighter than I usually am.
    <br>I almost fell over because I wasn't aware that I was that light.
    <br>Then I started walking and I started feeling no pain,
    <br>and I felt like, "What is going on here? This is not normal."
    <br>I was supposed to be taking my time up, but I was shaking like the wind was just blowing me.
    <br>It was some sense of relief and I just knew right there that everything that I had been through was over.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean for the first time in your life, that you can recall, as you stood up at that moment,
    <br>you did not feel pain in your body?
    <br>Yes, which is still overwhelming really, to tell you the truth.
    <br>And ever since that prayer you received, can you just describe to us -
    <br>what are the incredible changes you've seen in your body, both physically and in terms of the pain.
    <br>Just describe to us what has happened after that prayer.
    <br>I can now do the head and shoulders thing.
    <br>The feet for example; my feet could never touch the ground fully;
    <br>but for the first time my toes and everything is on the shoe, which is very weird.
    <br>And I can walk, without feeling any pain.
    <br>Every time I walked; if you were close to me, you would hear my joints pop in and out making sound.
    <br>There is no more sound.
    <br>I can write properly now.
    <br>I wrote my name with one of the evangelists, and she was like, "It doesn't look like your handwriting".
    <br>Last week I wrote my name but it looked like a cat's scratch.
    <br>You couldn't make out whether the "E" wasn't an "A", or the "L" was a "T", but right now I can write.
    <br>For some reason I can read the Bible without my glasses even,
    <br>which I couldn't do previously, because my eyes would dislocate.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You said before that at any given time parts of your body would dislocate, pop out.
    <br>Ever since that prayer, just describe the changes you have seen in that area.
    <br>Ever since the prayer...
    <br>I would have dislocated my jaw by now of course, because I have been talking too much,
    <br>which is actually quite nice to talk.
    <br>Usually my hand would get stuck, if I was using my hands too much,
    <br>but no finger, no elbow, no hip, no neck, nothing has popped out ever since Sunday.
    <br>People who were with me before the man of God came to me would know that,
    <br>they were worried and trying to figure out how to put back my knee and my shoulder.
    <br>They were all actually very hysterical because they have never seen something like that before.
    <br>Some other person fainted for two minutes, I think.
    <br>You mean that on that Sunday before prayer, some parts of your body dislocated?
    <br>Five minutes before the man of God prayed for me, my joints had popped out.
    <br>As he came, there were already things being put back in place.
    <br>He moved and passed me and we were trying to fix one,
    <br>and then he moved again; when he came back, we were fixing the shoulder that came out,
    <br>but about 4 others had popped out within the 5 minutes space of time.
    <br>People of God, we can understand the nature of this miracle.
    <br>Our sister said that on that day, just minutes before Prophet T.B. Joshua even prayed for her,
    <br>5 different parts of her body dislocated.
    <br>But ever since that touch, as we are seeing on the screen right now,
    <br>no single part of her body is dislocated and she is doing things, that she could never do before.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sister, you said before that you couldn't even write.
    <br>Could you just, for the glory of God, demonstrate what you can now do,
    <br>just to testify to the people of God the wonderful healing in your life.
    <br>So we can see our sister there; she is actually writing on a board.
    <br>Nthabeleng Ramoedi & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean to say, sister, you couldn't do this before?
    <br>It would look like a cat's scratch, trust me.
    <br>You wouldn't know if the "G" was an "O" or whether the "D" was cojoined to the "O", or something like that.
    <br>Wow. Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now, for the glory of God; we just want to see you walking freely in the midst of the people of God,
    <br>to demonstrate what you can now do that you couldn't do before,
    <br>or if you attempted to do it before, a part of your body would dislocate.
    <br>Wow, we can see our sister walking freely, in the midst of the people of God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You said, sister, that before, you couldn't even stand up straight, like you are standing now.
    <br>No, I couldn't stand up straight.
    <br>I would always - I had a hunchback.
    <br>But now I'm all straight up.
    <br>I could even try modelling, if I wanted to.
    <br>My posture is all back now.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Indeed, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Our sister knows the extent of the differences in her life after that prayer.
    <br>For her entire life, she has been in pain and that has been her normal life.
    <br>She has been accustomed to pain, to different parts of her body dislocating at any given time.
    <br>But right now, we can see her standing freely in the midst of the people of God.
    <br>Sister, you said before you couldn't even talk like this to people for such a long time.
    <br>True, because in-between I would probably gasp for air like, "Hold on", then come back to you.
    <br>Or my eyes would start rolling because I had seizures as well,
    <br>or I would have to sit down for a bit, and I would never stand this long, without needing a chair,
    <br>which is actually very new for me.
    <br>Usually I would just pass lines; I would never queue.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>This is an incredible miracle and we give all the glory to God.
    <br>Sister, before listening to your advice, we would like to hear from our brother here as well
    <br>who has one or two words to say concerning the miraculous healing in your life.
    <br>Nthabeleng Ramoedi & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>We are from Lesotho, and we are managing a private hospital that God Almighty offered unto us.
    <br>When medicine calls a diagnosis a syndrome, you should know we really are not sure of what is happening.
    <br>This young lady is my niece and we encountered the first, very severe symptoms of her disease in 2010.
    <br>She had just visited us and she developed this seizure.
    <br>I would say that was the most severe one that she had,
    <br>because we knew that from time to time she used to dislocate diverse joints in her body.
    <br>With this type of seizure she had, we gave her all medications that we knew,
    <br>that were supposed to abort her seizures but they couldn't help.
    <br>We had to refer her to a more equipped hospital, where she could meet a neurologist.
    <br>All diverse investigations have been done of her condition.
    <br>In this particular case, an EEG was done in order to conclude whether she was an epileptic
    <br>but all without a conclusive test.
    <br>Her heart muscles from time to time would be weak, her lungs would be weak, she would be on nebulizers,
    <br>she has had heart ECGs done several times, but all with normal results.
    <br>In short: she has been through all different tests, but it came out without any conclusive diagnosis.
    <br>Definitely, if muscles are not well, it means every organ can never function,
    <br>because we all are made of muscles and ligaments.
    <br>That is why her body could not control anything of her own.
    <br>But on top of all, I just praise God; I thank God for the healing that she received
    <br>because ever since last week I have been with her day and night
    <br>and she has never had what she had before we came here.
    <br>And I just thank God for that.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Madam, speaking from a medical perspective; what can you just testify about what happened
    <br>when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for her and those changes that you've seen in her body since then?
    <br>What can you say as a medical doctor concerning this?
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua came to meet her, I personally knew that the devil was going to give up.
    <br>I am a living testimony because I had a lumbar spondylosis, for which I was prayed for,
    <br>and here I am standing.
    <br>What she went through was a major seizure, that every organ in her body just refused
    <br>and was arrested by the Spirit of God that was facing her.
    <br>At the end of it all, she was freed.
    <br>Immediately after the prayer, she asked to go to the toilet, and she was virtually running in front of me.
    <br>Being a very jovial person, she started dancing for everybody.
    <br>She has been perfectly normal, she has been eating normally,
    <br>she has never had the abdominal blow that she would normally have
    <br>and none of her joints has ever popped out.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>We give all the glory to God.
    <br>We just would like to ask you, madam: What is your word of advice, especially as a medical personnel,
    <br>what would be your word of advice and encouragement to our viewers all over the world,
    <br>and those who may be suffering from such an unusual disease; one that medically has no cure -
    <br>what is your word of advice to them?
    <br>Doctors, medical personnel, God uses us to treat but He is the only One who can heal.
    <br>When you are faced with conditions that are beyond our own understanding,
    <br>that is the time when we have to say, "God  should take over".
    <br>We don't need to rely upon our own strength, or knowledge
    <br>because indeed, we are limited as human beings
    <br>and we have to be counsellors of our own patients, for them to know that God has the final say.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We really thank God for the role that our mother and father played in encouraging our sister to come
    <br>to The SCOAN, and taking care of her to the point where she received that prayer.
    <br>We would like to hear a word from our father here as well.
    <br>Sir, you are welcome.
    <br>Please, introduce yourself to us and tell us what you can say about the wonderful healing
    <br>in the life of our sister here.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Indeed, God is with us.
    <br>Of course, if God is with us, who can be against you?
    <br>No one.
    <br>The patient has said it all.
    <br>I'm using the word "patient" because I'm used to that word.
    <br>The patient has said it all.

    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>I'm from Lesotho.
    <br>We have a private hospital, God has blessed us with,
    <br>where we first saw the problem of epileptic seizures, which really were not epileptic.
    <br>On my left side is my wife; we have been married for over 30 years, and we thank God for that.
    <br>The young lady is the niece.
    <br>They have said everything about the condition.
    <br>You see, every organ in the body has a collagen fibre, or muscular tissue.
    <br>If you have a problem in the brain, obviously it may result in a fit.
    <br>For you to have multiple conditions in the intestines, joins, jaws of any kind,
    <br>then it is a confusion that people would treat in isolation.
    <br>If you have an eye problem, it is treated in isolation,
    <br>if you have an intestine problem, it is treated in isolation,
    <br>if you have a bladder issue, it is treated in isolation.
    <br>It is almost impossible to have all these conditions under one's eye, except the eyes of God.
    <br>So, we decided to bring her to The SCOAN, where we have received deliverance and healing.
    <br>My wife is a living testimony; she had spondylosis and disc prolapse, and here she is standing.
    <br>There was no reason for us to doubt God.
    <br>In fact, I would want to say that in this world today, we have science, medicine, and organizations;
    <br>those are the things we believe in,
    <br>without realizing that it is God who has used people to create this science and medicine.
    <br>We should realise that when we fall out of rope, we should hang on to faith.
    <br>That is the very reason why we know that doctors fall sick as well.
    <br>If doctors knew everything, doctors would never be sick.
    <br>If scientists knew everything, the scientists would never be sick.
    <br>We all do false things, because we are natural, human beings.
    <br>We must turn to the supernatural, and that is the King of kings and the Lord of lords.
    <br>We thank God for the miracle.
    <br>The storm is over - thank God!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sir, what can you testify about the changes in the life of your niece after the prayer,
    <br>and what can you say about what happened
    <br>when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for her on that day last week.
    <br>Yes; just before that, her shoulder dislocated and I had to push it back.
    <br>While she was sitting down, the knee came out of the position and I was trying to put it back,
    <br>and T.B. Joshua was praying for a lady just next to her.
    <br>Then Prophet T.B. Joshua came and as spoken to by Jesus, he was used to pray for the young lady
    <br>and all of a sudden she was on the floor.
    <br>Just a stretch of the arm again and everything, the storm in her life calmed down.
    <br>Since then, she has never had any dislocation from any single, big or small joint.
    <br>Neither has she had any convulsion or seizure.
    <br>She is fine, she is able to eat, she doesn't have any issues with her intestines.
    <br>She has actually had a constipation, which she had for 3 months before,
    <br>but now she doesn't have any condition like that.
    <br>She is fine and free - free at last!
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And we know, as you rightly said, sir, that medically, this condition was incurable,
    <br>there was nothing that could be done more than had been attempted from a medical perspective.
    <br>But today, she is a living testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>What is your word of advice, sir, to our viewers around the world, especially those in the medical field?
    <br>My dear brethren in the medical and scientific field:
    <br>I would want to say that we are material beings and God uses us - it is good.
    <br>God has used us, God is still using us and God will use us.
    <br>Science and medicine are created by God;
    <br>therefore, we should know our limits and we should not be oblivious or boastful
    <br>when we take care of a patient and the patient gets fine.
    <br>We should know our limits and we should give credit to God, because we treat but God is the Healer.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Finally, we just want to hear the last word from our sister.
    <br>We would like to hear from you, sister; what is your own word of advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>You are a living testimony to the power of God, and healing you've received.
    <br>What is your word of encouragement and advice to our viewers?
    <br>Never, never lose faith.
    <br>It doesn't matter how big your trial or situation is; don't let your situation determine who you are,
    <br>because God's time is always the best.
    <br>If someone told me 10 years ago, or 2 weeks ago that I would be here standing,
    <br>talking to all of you without any pain, I would have probably said, "Ha ha ha".
    <br>But with God's grace, I'm here and I'm not sarcastically laughing; I'm laughing because I'm happy.
    <br>I'm smiling for the first time without having any pain, I'm overjoyed.
    <br>Quite frankly, after the service, I will ask whoever is around, "Let's go dancing and praise the Lord".
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We can see this sling that your aunt is holding.
    <br>You said that this was something before you had to carry with you anywhere you went
    <br>because at any given time, a part of your body would dislocate.
    <br>What do you want to do with this now?
    <br>Let's just shove it off somewhere.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Brethren, we have listened to our sister's testimony.
    <br>Just imagine if God Almighty could heal her from a condition that had plagued her entire life,
    <br>causing extreme pain 24/7, today she is walking freely, living freely without pain to the glory of God,
    <br>what is your own situation?
    <br>Just use your faith to put a demand on the anointing that is available here,
    <br>and the same God that healed our sister is present to touch your own case today,
    <br>and your case will not escape the anointing of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>If you believe that, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
