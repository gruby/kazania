    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>My name is Jude. I am from Anambra State but I stay in South Africa.
    <br>We can see a brother standing beside you. Who is he to you?
    <br>He is my junior brother, Emmanuel Onyeka.
    <br>During today's live Sunday Service,
    <br>during the mass prayer the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave you a message of prophecy.
    <br>Can you please share with us what the man of God, T.B. Joshua, said to you?
    <br>The man of God came up to me and asked me where my brother was.
    <br>I called Onyeka, my junior brother.
    <br>He said that there was a problem in the family.
    <br>He said that I was here for a purpose and secondly, an accident and sudden death.
    <br>He said that Onyeka was the next person but that they would not kill him.
    <br>Where is your brother?
    <br>Onyeka!
    <br>OnyekaChukwu!
    <br>The two of you are here for a purpose.
    <br>- There is a trouble in your family.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Sudden death.
    <br>- Yes, sir. Man of God.
    <br>Help me to call him. Onyeka, they want to kill you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Onyeka, I want to join your family.
    <br>My name is T.B. Joshua Onyeka.
    <br>They will not kill you.
    <br>This is the second accident now.
    <br>Go and wait for me.
    <br>They keep killing the family. Onyeka is the next person. They are lying.
    <br>Onyeka stand up.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Onyeka!
    <br>I join this family. My name should be T.B. Joshua Onyeka.
    <br>The prophecy is 1,000 percent true.
    <br>There is a big problem in my family.
    <br>I went to South Africa in 1997, which is 15 years ago now
    <br>but any time I planned to come to Nigeria there would be problems;
    <br>serious problems whereby I would lose everything I had.
    <br>Even my wife wanted to come with me to Nigeria to establish herself
    <br>but died in a car accident when she planned to come on March 17th, 2008
    <br>and she left this boy with me.
    <br>Things were very difficult. I could not even afford to feed the boy, he stayed with his cousins.
    <br>Even at this stage to pay my house rent is a problem.
    <br>I had tried to come to Nigeria but each time I tried there would be a big problem.
    <br>This time I had to mortgage my car to come here because
    <br>I started having attacks and seeing dead people in my dreams.
    <br>I mortgaged my car to come to Nigeria
    <br>because I have tried everything and I believed that The SCOAN would be my last bus stop.
    <br>Even as I was coming from South Africa I wrote it down that I said to God,
    <br>'Oh God, I am not commanding You but The SCOAN is my last bus stop.
    <br>If You don't answer my prayer at The SCOAN, I think it is better I go to the grave.'
    <br>You mean you wrote this statement in the airplane when you were coming, saying,
    <br>'Oh God, I am not commanding You but The SCOAN is my last bus stop.
    <br>If nothing is achieved here, I still believe that You are God,
    <br>but I think it would be better for me to go down to the grave.'
    <br>You mean you came to The SCOAN believing that it was your last bus stop,
    <br>and if God Almighty didn't answer your situation, you were going to kill yourself. Is that what that statement means?
    <br>Exactly because there was no point of my living.
    <br>For 15 years I never saw my mother or my family, if not for my younger brother.
    <br>We thank God Almighty that He intervened in your situation.
    <br>During the prophecy the man of God also said that there was a sudden death.
    <br>How can you confirm that prophecy to be true?
    <br>And he also said that he saw two accidents. What can you say about that?
    <br>The first accident I had, you can see here
    <br>and here.
    <br>This was from the first accident and in the second accident my friend who was driving died.
    <br>The man of God also spoke about 'sudden death'. What can you say about that?
    <br>There is sudden death in my life because even my wife died in a car accident.
    <br>Ever since that time, I kept seeing dead people in my dreams and having attacks.
    <br>On 5th of January I received a phone call while I was sleeping.
    <br>It was like a dream. When I received that phone call, I said, 'Hello. Who is that?' -
    <br>my head just swallowed and I shouted.
    <br>I believe that there was a demon that entered that room
    <br>and I wanted to remove my clothes and run away from there.
    <br>My father died in 2001 with sudden death while I was in South Africa.
    <br>Since he died, I never came to Nigeria because anytime I tried to come to Nigeria there would be a big problem
    <br>and I would lose everything I had.
    <br>I had never come to Nigeria since then, this is my first time coming back to Nigeria.
    <br>And the man of God said you were here for a purpose.
    <br>Can you tell us why you are here and can you confirm the prophecy of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>What he said is true because I came with a purpose.
    <br>Since my wife died there was an accident fund that the lawyer was supposed to pay for me to establish myself,
    <br>but since then, they never paid me anything and I had been
    <br>trying everything possible to come to Nigeria to see my mother and brothers.
    <br>I came here for deliverance because I knew that what was happening to me was not natural but a spiritual attack,
    <br>which I could not save myself from.
    <br>I believe that only God could save me through Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>because I was always seeing how God was using Him to save many people.
    <br>That was why I said that if I come to The SCOAN and my prayers were not answered,
    <br>it would be better for me to go to the grave because I didn't have any other hope.
    <br>The man of God asked for your brother and you called him out.
    <br>What did the man of God say concerning your brother Onyeka?
    <br>The man of God said that Onyeka is the next person, the next target to die.
    <br>I confirm because since the past two days I saw him, we were talking
    <br>and he had been telling me what he had been passing through.
    <br>He also said that I would not die and Onyeka would not die.
    <br>- Can we hear from your brother Onyeka?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>So brother, we welcome you to The SCOAN, Lagos, Nigeria today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Please tell us your name and where you come from.
    <br>I am Onyekachukwu Emmanuel.
    <br>I am from Anambra State.
    <br>We can see a man standing beside you. Can you tell us who is he to you?
    <br>He is my elder brother I am just seeing for the first time in 15 years.
    <br>I saw him two days ago, which is a great thing for me and my family.
    <br>So you mean two days ago you saw your brother for the first time after 15 years?
    <br>Since 1997 I have not seen my brother.
    <br>When I saw him two days ago I said, "God, You are wonderful!"
    <br>because I thought something had happened to him that I would not recognize him again
    <br>but the joy was overwhelming when we saw each other.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for bringing you both together in love and unity.
    <br>During today's service the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, called your brother and your brother called you out,
    <br>and he have you a message of prophecy.
    <br>Can you tell us what the man of God said concerning you?
    <br>As the prophecies were going on,
    <br>the man of God was moving in the direction of where my brother was, I said, "God..."
    <br>There was a song that my mother used to always sing
    <br>which says, "God, say it is finished!"
    <br>I just remembered the song and I was meditating on it.
    <br>Immediately when the man of God said, "Uncle, come", I said, "Ah! Uncle, come?"
    <br>The next thing I saw was my brother calling me.
    <br>The man of God had asked him, "Where is your brother?". He said, "Okay, Onyeka!" and I cried tears of joy.
    <br>In fact God has done everything, I am very glad.
    <br>We thank God Almighty.
    <br>Once again, we want to ask you: What did the man of God say concerning you during the message of prophecy?
    <br>The man of God said there were problems in the family and that he came for a purpose.
    <br>As soon as I came out, the man of God asked me, "You are Onyeka?" and I said, "Yes".
    <br>Out of joy, I hugged my brother and surprisingly, the man of God that I had always been trying just to see his face,
    <br>he joined and embraced us together.
    <br>That is a great thing.
    <br>They Will Not Kill You | Prophecy | TB Joshua
    <br>Onyeka, I want to join your family.
    <br>My name is T.B. Joshua Onyeka.
    <br>The man of God said that they wanted to kill my brother and Onyeka, which is me, was the next target.
    <br>He said they will not kill my brother and they will not kill me.
    <br>Where is your brother?
    <br>Onyeka! Onyekachukwu!
    <br>Because you people are here for a purpose.
    <br>- There is trouble in your family.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Sudden death.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Help me call him. Onyeka!
    <br>Onyeka, they want to kill you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Onyeka! I want to join your family.
    <br>My name is T.B. Joshua Onyeka.
    <br>They will not kill you. This is the second accident now.
    <br>Go and wait for me. They keep killing the family. Onyeka is the next person. They are lying.
    <br>Onyeka, stand up.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Onyeka!
    <br>I join this family. My name should be T.B. Joshua Onyeka.
    <br>When he said it, I was not surprised because I had been having terrible experiences for many years.
    <br>Sometimes in my dreams a group of people will be pursuing me.
    <br>Sometimes, when I don't know what to do I would shout the name Jesus and I will see myself being taken away.
    <br>And when that happens, I wake up.
    <br>Some other time they chase me with a big stick, not even a cane, but sticks like planks
    <br>and there would be up to 20 people pursuing me.
    <br>And they would get me, hitting me anyhow in order to kill me
    <br>and I would be shouting, "I did not do anything, you people are trying to kill me in vain."
    <br>So at the point where they want to kill me, I will just wake up and I would start praying.
    <br>Sometimes I would be scared of sleeping.
    <br>Considering all these things, I said to God, "I don't know, forgive me my sins
    <br>but I still have the faith that I am not going to die."
    <br>When I remember my brother in South Africa, I would say, "No, it is not possible."
    <br>In fact, something used to tell me that there is danger.
    <br>So, what the man of God said is 100 percent true.
    <br>So, you are confirming everything the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, said
    <br>concerning your family to be 100 percent true?
    <br>Yes, I confirm it.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for revealing the root cause of your problem
    <br>and we believe God Almighty has brought solution to your lives.
