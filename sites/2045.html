  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade
    <br>With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade
    <br>With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>We wish to recognise our leaders
    <br>from Dominican Republic.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>And other nations,
    <br>our Christian leaders,
    <br>our religious leaders,
    <br>our political leaders
    <br>and all other professionals here present -
    <br>thank you for your coming.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We are here as the Lord instructed.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade
    <br>With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>We are asking Him to cause us to be spiritually and mentally alert during this time of meditation and prayer.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Yes; like I have said - everything big starts little.
    <br>I will start our message from the basics - the foundation.
    <br>That will take us to the Book of Romans 5.
    <br>I will read some verses there.
    <br>Peace and hope.
    <br>"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith,
    <br>we have peace with God
    <br>through our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.
    <br>... we boast in the hope of the glory of God.
    <br>Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;
    <br>perseverance, character; and character, hope.
    <br>And hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts..."
    <br>If I may take you to verse 6 there:
    <br>"You see, at just the right time,
    <br>when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
    <br>Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person,
    <br>though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love for us..."
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Less attention
    <br>has been given
    <br>to the work of God -
    <br>to the work of the Holy Spirit
    <br>compared to the wealth of material available
    <br>in the life and ministry of Jesus.
    <br>This will lead us to:
    <br>SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM
    <br>The Kingdom is a spiritual Kingdom.
    <br>The first place we are to prosper in
    <br>is in our spiritual life.
    <br>Seek first the Kingdom.
    <br>His Kingdom is a spiritual Kingdom,
    <br>which we call salvation.
    <br>Salvation is basically
    <br>a spiritual rebirth.
    <br>Seek first the Kingdom
    <br>means to be born again.
    <br>And when we are born again,
    <br>we are taken out of the satanic kingdom -
    <br>the kingdom of darkness
    <br>and we are placed
    <br>into the Kingdom of Jesus - the Kingdom of Light.
    <br>It is not something
    <br>we just hope for
    <br>or wish for;
    <br>it is a reality.
    <br>That is, it's real.
    <br>If the Son sets us free,
    <br>we are free indeed.
    <br>This is why we must not only commit the Word to memory
    <br>but should let the Word become an integral part of our being
    <br>because it is not just the theory of the Word
    <br>or history of the Word.
    <br>We are only made spiritual
    <br>by living in the Word
    <br>and by the Word living in us.
    <br>Living in the Word
    <br>and the Word living in us,
    <br>not just theory of the Word
    <br>or history of the Word.
    <br>We are only made spiritual
    <br>by living in the Word
    <br>and by the Word living in us.
    <br>The reality:
    <br>The reality of our salvation
    <br>will be judged
    <br>by our willingness,
    <br>cheerful eagerness
    <br>to part with our possessions
    <br>for the good of others.
    <br>Because the beauty of life
    <br>does not depend only on our happiness
    <br>but the happiness of others.
    <br>The question: What have you done to make others happy?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What have you done to make others happy?"
    <br>Somebody needs something you possess.
    <br>It may be your love.
    <br>It may be your smile.
    <br>It may be your strength.
    <br>It may be your money.
    <br>Somebody needs something you possess.
    <br>What have you done to make others happy?
    <br>Because the beauty of life
    <br>does not depend on your happiness only
    <br>but what you can do to make others happy.
    <br>To be born again
    <br>is about contentment.
    <br>Possessions and money alone cannot bring contentment;
    <br>giving help to others can.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade
    <br>With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Giving help to others can!
    <br>What have you done to help others?
    <br>How many of us
    <br>after receiving a miracle -
    <br>healing,
    <br>deliverance,
    <br>blessing,
    <br>salvation from God -
    <br>will see the help of the needy -
    <br>the help of the poor,
    <br>the help of refugees
    <br>as a priority
    <br>over building a new mansion,
    <br>or buying a new Jeep -
    <br>buying an expensive Jeep?
    <br>How many of us
    <br>after receiving your blessing today,
    <br>will see the help of the needy, the poor, the widow, the refuge,
    <br>as a priority
    <br>over buying a new Jeep or building a new mansion?
    <br>Don't forget,
    <br>we are spiritual beings.
    <br>We are spiritual beings.
    <br>The real thing about us is not our bodies.
    <br>Jesus said
    <br>in John 8:36,
    <br>"If the Son sets us free,
    <br>we shall be free indeed."
    <br>Jesus meant the liberation of the spirit of man.
    <br>This means if we sow to the flesh,
    <br>we will reap of the flesh.
    <br>If we sow to the Spirit,
    <br>we will reap eternal life.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade
    <br>With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Our attachment to possessions,
    <br>our attachment to money
    <br>is a serious barrier between us
    <br>and true spiritual birth and growth.
    <br>The way and manner we manage our possessions, our money
    <br>shows that these things have replaced God in our lives.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade
    <br>With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>We worship and adore money,
    <br>forgetting the first commandment
    <br>which says,
    <br>"Thou shall not worship any other god."
    <br>But money has become our god.
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade
    <br>With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>Prosperity is now seen as a reward
    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade
    <br>With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>whereas God is the Rewarder
    <br>of those who diligently seek Him.

    <br>Prosperity is seen as a reward

    <br>The Dominican Republic Crusade
    <br>With T.B. Joshua - Day 1
    <br>The first place we are to prosper in
    <br>is in our spiritual life.
    <br>If not,
    <br>we will be enslaved
    <br>spiritually,
    <br>physically,
    <br>financially.
    <br>I want to leave you here because I am seeing some sick people around.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Seek first the Kingdom
    <br>and all other things shall be added to you."
    <br>Thank you!
