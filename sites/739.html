  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers, thank you for your time.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>I want to rejoice with you because the atmosphere is of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All you need is to meditate on the testimonies you have been hearing since morning.
    <br>A lot of testimonies, that is God's work.
    <br>Meditate on the Word.
    <br>The more you meditate on the Word, the more your spirit - heart - acts upon the Word.
    <br>When the Word dominates our heart, it influences our character and our conduct.
    <br>The testimony of this, the testimony of that - they all point to salvation.
    <br>The more you meditate on the Word - testimonies - the more your heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>And when we allow all these to influence us, it leads to good character and conduct.
    <br>When all what you have been seeing since morning, hearing since morning,
    <br>the message the evangelist delivered here today...
    <br>If you allow all these to dominate your heart, it will influence your conduct and your character.
    <br>When you leave here today, you will just find yourself behaving in a different way.
    <br>No longer the way you were behaving before.
    <br>You are a smoker, you find yourself no longer smoking.
    <br>You talk too much,  you just find yourself....
    <br>We are all waiting for something.
    <br>When healing, anointing is present, we put a demand through our faith.
    <br>But there is healing, anointing everywhere.
    <br>This is why you can dance, you are happy since morning.
    <br>Those who have diabetes, they can't feel it any longer.
    <br>Hypertension is suddenly gone.
    <br>You have been dancing, these are the things you cannot do at home without taking a drug or tablet.
    <br>But you have been...
    <br>There is something!
    <br>There is something ... what is that something?
    <br>Oh, my God.
    <br>For you to suddenly have that faith that there is something you cannot see.
    <br>You have not seen, you don't know that something but because of your faith,
    <br>you believe there is something!
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is expecting God to do what He promised to do.
    <br>That is faith!
    <br>I saw you when you were going round.
    <br>There is something..
    <br>When you look, you can't see that something.
    <br>There is something. What is that; where is that something?
    <br>And yet you have not seen that something - because you believe!
    <br>Faith, that is faith.
    <br>So, here we have healing anointing.
    <br>I can feel it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, when healing anointing, I mean healing virtues, is present in a place -
    <br>through our faith, we put a demand on the anointing.
    <br>Miracles and all of God's blessings come by putting a demand on the anointing through our faith.
    <br>The anointing is everywhere; it is more than sufficient.
    <br>So what you are demanding - it is more than enough.
    <br>Faith is a trust. Say it to your neighbour.
    <br>Faith is a trust.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Faith is a trust.
    <br>Again.
    <br>Faith is a trust.
    <br>Again.
    <br>Faith is a trust.
    <br>This is why you need that trust - faith to put a demand on the anointing.
    <br>Anointing is the power of God.
    <br>Where there is God, there is power
    <br>Here God, here power.
    <br>When God smiles, power smiles.
    <br>When God walks, power walks.
    <br>When God sits, power sits.
    <br>When God looks, power looks.
    <br>So, power of God.
    <br>Without that faith, you cannot put a demand -
    <br>demand for healing, blessing, deliverance, salvation.
    <br>Just mention those things you demand for.
    <br>You can now put a demand on what? On anointing; the power of God.
    <br>There is no other means.
    <br>this is why the Bible says: Only faith pleases Him.
    <br>Only faith pleases him.
    <br>[Song: Trust and Obey]
    <br>Only faith pleases Him. Nothing else!
    <br>And there is so much stress when you talk of faith.
    <br>People begin to say, "Ah faith ...ah faith, I don't have faith". No no no!
    <br>No, faith is not something you look within.
    <br>It is simple. Just grab it this way.
    <br>When you realise that God is reliable, like many testimonies you heard today
    <br>and you are able to consult, meet them to ask them what are you saying
    <br>and you are able to establish your facts
    <br>and you realise that truly, what they are saying is true -
    <br>then, God is reliable.
    <br>And the moment you realise that God is reliable, faith grows simultaneously.
    <br>Like as you are sitting down.
    <br>Begin to meditate over what you have seen today.
    <br>Meditate on the message.
    <br>Begin to meditate, meditate, meditate.
    <br>And the more you meditate, the more your spirit - heart - acts upon the Word.
    <br>Begin to meditate in your heart.
    <br>Whatever you receive now, without maintenance, it is useless.
    <br>It's better not to ask for something you cannot maintain.
    <br>It's better not to receive something you cannot maintain
    <br>because it will expose you and put you in the hands of the enemy.
    <br>Those who know you to be this, suddenly later realise that you are zero.
    <br>They will make mockery of you.
    <br>It takes faith to maintain your position to the end.
    <br>The beauty of our achievement is when we no longer live and the achievement is still there.
    <br>Tell your neighbor: The beauty of our achievement, the glory of our achievement
    <br>is when we are no longer living but that achievement is still there,
    <br>lingering on in the eyes and ears of children yet unborn.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the beauty.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are not necessarily being blessed by God because of today
    <br>but we are blessed because of tomorrow,
    <br>when we are no longer living.
    <br>Children yet unborn want to see things that can influence them to do right.
    <br>They say, "Ah, I want to be this... Ah, I want to be this".
    <br>"This person with such name lived such kind of life."
    <br>"This is what to achieve." - "No, no, I would love to be like him!"
    <br>It's not necessarily because of today you are blessed.
    <br>You are blessed because of tomorrow when you are no longer living
    <br>but that achievement continues to live
    <br>so that our children yet unborn can be influenced in a positive way by our achievement
    <br>because you will no longer live to educate them, to tell them the right way to follow.
    <br>But what you have achieved will be the one to talk to them, to tell them what to do.
    <br>Your concentration is so much on what you want to achieve - what you need.
    <br>That is your concentration.
    <br>Yes, you want to be this, you want to be that!
    <br>Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>We have so many role models - the good and the bad - in our family and community.
    <br>You have seen so many that are poor, that are suffering throughout their lives
    <br>and seen so many achieve great things.
    <br>You have seen so many that are living and those that are no longer living.
    <br>Which part are we following?
    <br>If you are known today and you are not known tomorrow, what is the value of it?
    <br>If your name is written today and your name vanishes tomorrow, what is the value?
    <br>Please, brethren, think about tomorrow.
    <br>Don't be deceived by the little you have.
    <br>Are you talking of marriage?
    <br>If you are thinking of the future - tomorrow - you would not rush.
    <br>You would not get married just like that without asking God
    <br>if this marriage will stand for tomorrow.
    <br>Many marriages will stand for today, but will not be able to stand for tomorrow.
    <br>Many businesses will stand today but will not be able to stand tommorow.
    <br>Many relationships will stand today but will not be able to stand tommorow.
    <br>But we should look for the One that will stand tomorrow because today is yours; tomorrow - God's.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Back to faith.
    <br>[MESSAGE TITLE:] FAITH IS MAINTENANCE
    <br>You will maintain your life when you live a life of faith.
    <br>You will be able to maintain your business, finances and health.
    <br>But to maintain this deliverance or whatever you receive from God - without faith, it is not possible.
    <br>That is why Jesus said, "I will make you fishers of men...fishers of men....fishers of men".
    <br>If you follow Him.
    <br>You can only follow Him by faith.
    <br>Now, let's define faith.
    <br>When faith comes, it influences our conduct and character.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How does this faith come?
    <br>Let's think about it.
    <br>Because you read the Bible, if I now take you to the message in the Bible that says,
    <br>"Faith comes by hearing the Word of God and obey",
    <br>you will say, "Ah, I have been hearing, I have been obeying, what else again?"
    <br>I will not take you to that.
    <br>Let me take you in a very short way.
    <br>Because the one we are used to "Faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God" -
    <br>may be difficult for you.
    <br>Let me just take you in a short way.
    <br>I was talking of meditation.
    <br>Meditation is a thing of the heart.
    <br>Since you know that faith lives in your heart, start it now.
    <br>Begin to meditate.
    <br>Meditate what I'm saying,
    <br>what you have been seeing since morning,
    <br>the testimony of people.
    <br>i will not use the word 'think'.
    <br>I will leave the word 'think' for your situation.
    <br>We think about our situation.
    <br>What am I going to eat today?
    <br>How will I pay the money? The debt?
    <br>How will I get out of this mess?
    <br>How will I pay my house rent? That is 'think'.
    <br>I will leave the word 'think' for your situation.
    <br>The word 'meditation' is a visit to God.
    <br>Meditation comes from the heart.
    <br>Thinking, many times, comes from mental assent.
    <br>The more you meditate on them, on those things,
    <br>the more your spirit - heart - acts, agrees, joins.
    <br>It is our heart now that we need to work on.
    <br>Whatever you engage your heart with influences your character and conduct.
    <br>Whatever your heart engages on would influence your character and conduct.
    <br>Now, engage your heart over what you have seen today, the testimony of people,
    <br>the message you heard from the evangelist, when you watch emmanuel tv.
    <br>All what you are seeing, the message, the testimony - engage your heart.
    <br>Not thinking - engage your heart.
    <br>When you engage your heart, what you are seeing or hearing on Emmanuel TV
    <br>will begin to influence your conduct and character.
    <br>That is faith.
