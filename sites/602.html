    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we recognise you.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Today, we shall look at the practical side of Christianity.
    <br>When we say, practical side of Christianity, we talk of the Spirit of God Himself.
    <br>LIFE THROUGH THE SPIRIT
    <br>Turn your Bible with me;
    <br>we take our reading from the Book of Romans 8.
    <br>"Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,
    <br>because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free
    <br>from the law of sin and death."
    <br>Where you see sin, you see death because they are synonymous.
    <br>Sin and death are synonymous.
    <br>I mean, the same father and mother, the same family.
    <br>"For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh,
    <br>God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh".
    <br>Let's go now to our proof text.
    <br>I will take this proof text from Romans 8:14.
    <br>"For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God".
    <br>It means, if you don't worship God in spirit, you are not one.
    <br>God is Spirit and His worshippers do so in spirit and truth.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>If you do not worship Him in spirit, you are not one of the children.
    <br>God is Spirit.
    <br>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>You can judge yourself, you can know whom you are serving, if you are one of them.
    <br>God is Spirit.
    <br>If we do not worship God, who is in the spirit,
    <br>you will be led by your emotions, intellectually -
    <br>that is, what you see, what you hear, what and how you feel.
    <br>If there is no money is your pocket, you say, "Jesus be cursed".
    <br>If there is money, you say, "Hallelujah! Jesus Christ!"
    <br>Many of us are here today because you have some money with you.
    <br>In the past, when there was no money, you were not here
    <br>because you are not led by the Spirit.
    <br>When there is no food on the table, you say, "Why?"
    <br>No church, no prayer.
    <br>When there is food on the table, you say, "Hallelujah! Emmanuel!"
    <br>What our circumstances look like...
    <br>If it is good, when you want to pray, you say, "Jesus, I'm sick. My leg is paining me".
    <br>You know, there is no time you would not have one or two things...
    <br>What man wants is unlimited.
    <br>So, when are you going to say in your prayer, "Thank You, Jesus"?
    <br>You are seeking miracles - salvation is there.
    <br>Seek first the Kingdom; all other...
    <br>If we do not worship God, who is a Spirit, in the spirit,
    <br>can we hope to obtain His favour and acceptance?
    <br>So, we miss the end of worship.
    <br>I mean, we worship ourselves.
    <br>This is why you see - you pray... - so frustrating.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, I know you are listening to me.
    <br>My message is in your bedroom, in your room, wherever you are.
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>If you are under the influence of my voice, listen to me.
    <br>There is no difference between here and where you are.
    <br>Believing is our connection.
    <br>Allow the Spirit of God to lead you.
    <br>Act on His guidance because man has the ability to look -
    <br>the Holy Spirit looks as He wills.
    <br>Man has the ability to talk - the Holy Spirit talks as He wills.
    <br>How would you know who is talking to you, whether it is T.B. Joshua or the Holy Spirit Himself?
    <br>When you are not in the Spirit, you can't know.
    <br>This is why our life is "epileptic; up - down".
    <br>We don't know the true ministers of God.
    <br>You don't know, you only listen to the eloquence.
    <br>Power to speak, friendliness - no, these are man natural gifts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Holy Spirit has a mind.
    <br>When you read the Book of Acts 16:6-7, the Holy Spirit has a mind.
    <br>In that Book of Romans 8:27 - the mind of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>A person has the ability to decide.
    <br>"No, I'm going..." - you have the ability to decide.
    <br>That is, exercising the will through the mind.
    <br>The Holy Spirit has the power of choice.
    <br>When a pastor is talking, you need to know who is talking.
    <br>Don't go by their ability to present or to deliver - no.
    <br>Anybody can deliver without the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The Holy Spirit has the power of choice; you have the ability to decide.
    <br>That is, exercising the will through the mind.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Commit yourself to the guidance of the Word."
    <br>- I cannot hear you. 
    <br>- [Commit yourself to the guidance of the Word.]
    <br>Viewers all over the world, say to your neighbour, or say to yourself,
    <br>"Commit yourself to the guidance of the Word."
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Commit yourself to the guidance of the Word.]
    <br>- I cannot hear you. 
    <br>- [Commit yourself to the guidance of the Word.]
    <br>Yes, commit yourself to the guidance of the Word.
    <br>God's Word refreshes our mind and His Spirit renews our strength.
    <br>Where can we go from His presence?
    <br>When one does not worship God, who is a Spirit, in the spirit,
    <br>the worship is defective.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When one does not worship God, who is a Spirit, in the spirit,
    <br>the worship is defective.
    <br>That is, carnal -
    <br>dealing only in the letter and referring to the Spirit and design
    <br>which are at a distance by types and ceremonies.
    <br>"No, I want to read just what is here. OK, Jesus is..."
    <br>Whatever we read, we need to examine it in the light of God's Word
    <br>because the Holy Spirit gives us the Word.
    <br>The Word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Look!
    <br>This is a tool - mic.
    <br>This is me.
    <br>If I'm not talking to this mic, the mic cannot work.
    <br>So, in the same way:
    <br>The Word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>He gives us the Word.
    <br>If the Word does not pass through Him,
    <br>you are speaking to yourself, speaking of yourself.
    <br>It is easier to say what God is not than to say what God is.
    <br>I take it back again.
    <br>It is easier to say what God is not than to say what God is.
    <br>We oftentimes say, "The Spirit of God says this, the Spirit of God says that".
    <br>When our worship is carnal, where do you see the Spirit of God?
    <br>How do you manage to hear from the Spirit of God when your worship is carnal?
    <br>When we know this, when you are not called, you shouldn't mention,
    <br>"Jesus says" - no.
    <br>I'm talking to you, Church.
    <br>We must depend upon God's Spirit for strength and assistance,
    <br>laying our souls under His influences and operations.
    <br>We must worship Him with fixedness of thought and a flame of affection,
    <br>with all within you, with all within me.
    <br>My head my shoulders
    <br>My knees my toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
    <br>My head my shoulders
    <br>My knees my toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
    <br>We must worship Him with fixedness of thought and a flame of affection.
    <br>I mean, with all that is within us.
    <br>Whenever you see me talk about Jesus
    <br>He is the Owner of my soul
    <br>He is the Owner
    <br>He is the Owner of my soul
    <br>This is a call from the Book of Romans 1:9.
    <br>When you start reading from verse 1 to the end - that is the message of Paul.
    <br>Worship Him with fixedness of thought and a flame of affection,
    <br>with all that is within you.
    <br>Commit yourself to the guidance of the Word.
    <br>No one can obey the Word of God without being led by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You must be led by the Holy Spirit to obey the Word of God
    <br>because the Holy Spirit gives the Word.
    <br>The Word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>With this, our knowledge of the Scripture is not the key, obedience is.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Our knowledge of the Scripture is not the key, issue - obedience is".
    <br>You must read, study to live;
    <br>not just read to teach or preach but to live.
    <br>Our knowledge of the Scripture is not the issue, obedience is.
    <br>You can master and quote the chapters and verses in the Bible for years
    <br>and hear thousands of sermons and read many Christian books
    <br>but still wear spiritual diapers.
    <br>... upon your knowledge of the Scriptures.
    <br>2 Timothy 3:7.
    <br>We are always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth.
    <br>You are good in listening to sermons.
    <br>You can leave here today and go to another crusade.
    <br>From one crusade to another.
    <br>You are very good in that.
    <br>As we are talking now, many came from another church to this church.
    <br>They attended one church, after this church they go to another church - this is our job.
    <br>We are always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the Truth.
    <br>You can pay tithes in 4, 5, 6 churches.
    <br>You are a member of almost 4, 5, 6, 7 churches.
    <br>That is our job.
    <br>Many of us here finish reading this Bible 3 to 4 times in a year.
    <br>We take it as a duty to read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation 3 to 4 times in a year.
    <br>Yet, Jesus does not know you.
    <br>He is in Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit;
    <br>talk to Him in Spirit, relate with Him in Spirit.
    <br>We must commit ourselves to the guidance of the Word.
    <br>We believe so much that once you are a member of a certain church,
    <br>you are a Christian and when you die, they bury you as a Christian -
    <br>it does not mean you will go to Heaven.
    <br>It is a ceremony.
    <br>On the last day, Jesus will say, "No".
    <br>Dealing only in the letter and referring to the Spirit and design
    <br>which are at a distance by types and ceremonies.
    <br>I want you to think about it
    <br>because I don't want us to miss ourselves on the last day.
    <br>There is another fellowship.
    <br>Do you know there is
    <br>another fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know there is another
    <br>fellowship in Heaven
    <br>So, you think the fellowship is in Heaven?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I know that Jesus is my Saviour
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is just a reflection.
    <br>See this light.
    <br>We see the reflection here - that is the earth.
    <br>Where the light comes from - Heaven.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No matter how many years you spend on earth, it is like turning back to Heaven.
    <br>If you spend 100 years here on earth, it is like turning back.
    <br>It means - home.
    <br>Our knowledge of the Scripture is not the key, issue - obedience is.
    <br>Find the time to read the Book of 2 Timothy 3:1-end.
    <br>The proof text is verse 7.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
