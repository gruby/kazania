    <br>THE JOURNEY TO THE SCHOOL
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Team Arrive At The Tropical Rainforest To Continue Their Journey To The School
    <br>Now, the journey to the new school begins.
    <br>Located in a remote area, 3 hours inside the Mache Chindul Ecological Reserve, transportation is difficult.
    <br>Five hours from Quito, inside the province of Esmeraldas,
    <br>the school can be reached only by 4x4 off-road vehicles or canoes,
    <br>but when conditions are bad, only on foot.
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Team Arrive At The Tropical Rainforest To Continue Their Journey To The School
    <br>T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team start their journey in 4x4 vehicles, into the jungle of Ecuador.
    <br>Not wanting his team to pass through the difficult elements, he has them enter inside the vehicle,
    <br>while he climbs into the back.
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Team Travel In 4x4 Vehicles Through A Tropical Rainforest To Reach The School
    <br>As they get deeper and deeper into the heart of the jungle, tropical rain suddenly starts to fall,
    <br>and the journey which had been smooth so far was about to take a more challenging turn.
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Team Travel In 4x4 Vehicles Through A Tropical Rainforest To Reach The School
    <br>The rain get heavier and heavier until the vehicle gets stuck in the mud of the mountain roads.
    <br>Due To Heavy Rainfall The Vehicle Carrying T.B. Joshua & Team Gets Stuck In The Mud
    <br>With the important opening of the school just hours away,
    <br>T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team have no choice but to continue on foot.
    <br>Due To Heavy Rainfall The Vehicle Carrying T.B. Joshua & Team Gets Stuck In The Mud
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Team Continue Their Journey To The School On Foot
    <br>T.B. Joshua & Team Enter A Second 4x4 Vehicle To Continue Their Journey To The School
    <br>However, with the wet and sticky conditions not easing off,
    <br>the vehicle soon gets stuck again, in another deep rut.
    <br>The Second Vehicle Also Gets Stuck In The Mud Due To Heavy Rainfall
    <br>T.B. Joshua encourages the team with a smile,
    <br>as they have to walk through the jungle in the pouring rain, yet again.
    <br>The local guides show T.B. Joshua an ingenious way of using the big leafy branches of plants
    <br>to shield themselves from the worst of the rain.
    <br>With a genuine smile, he obligingly tries it out, holding the giant leaf over his head,
    <br>as they continue the arduous track through the mountain pass.

    <br>An encouraging sight - the community finally comes into view,
    <br>as they take a turn on one of the ridges, and motivated the team begins to pick up their pace,
    <br>now that the end is in sight.
    <br>Peering through the vegetation, you can see the school
    <br>built and donated by T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>nestling into the midst of the community, on the site of the previous school,
    <br>which was destroyed during the horrendous earthquake of April 2016.

    <br>and can comfortably accommodate over 300 people.
    <br>Taking a look inside of one of the classrooms, we can see that it is large and spacious enough
    <br>to hold classes of over 30 people.

    <br>We are very grateful to the Lord and to Prophet T.B. Joshua for coming to Ecuador.
    <br>Many institutions do not look at remote places in mountains and rural areas
    <br>but we give thanks to the Lord because Prophet T.B. Joshua has made a difference.
    <br>He has taught us what the Bible says that it is better to give than to receive.
    <br>We are very grateful because he has come with his whole team to Ecuador
    <br>who worked really hard in this community.

    <br>It is a long, tiring, almost two-hour walk back to the city, made all the more difficult by the thick squelchy mud.

    <br>As he sees the team wading through the mud, he offers to take two people with him on the horse.
    <br>Ever the man of compassion, T.B. Joshua announces Mrs Evelyn Joshua and one of the team

    <br>OK, the two of you – tell him.
    <br>For two of you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Two can go with him.

    <br>Viewers, see me eating like any other person on the street.
    <br>Yes, I am running out of food.
    <br>That is humanitarian work for you.
    <br>Many a time we do this humanitarian work for God’s sake
    <br>and we run out of what we have given.
    <br>We went to give blessing; now, we are running out of that blessing.
    <br>Occasionally, this has to happen to test our faith, to test our genuineness, to test our gracious giving -
    <br>whether it is genuine or not.
    <br>It is not all the time you give and God supplies.
    <br>At times, you give and the supply will not come.
    <br>Our vehicle cannot go any further.
    <br>They are looking for another vehicle.
    <br>Sometimes, you may not find a vehicle – we will sleep here.
    <br>Are you not ready to sleep?
    <br>We are ready to sleep!
    <br>Yes, sir!
    <br>We are going on a mission and it is not all missions that are smooth.
    <br>Some can be very, very tough.
    <br>We are just experiencing this now – the toughest mission we are experiencing, we are going through
    <br>and it is a blessing.
    <br>What a rare privilege to suffer for the needy.
    <br>There are many people out there but God chose us to come and do this.
    <br>I can see a snail!
    <br>While Walking Back From The School T.B. Joshua Sights A Snail
    <br>Come and see the snail.
    <br>Yes, it is a big snail.
    <br>Not snake; it’s a snail.
    <br>Don’t let viewers feel threatened.
    <br>We are not looking for snakes; this is a snail.
    <br>Do you want to take this snail?
    <br>While Walking Back From The School T.B. Joshua Sights A Snail
    <br>Wonderful – but we don’t know where to eat it.
    <br>We need a fire.
    <br>Let’s ask this man if he can help us; we have to eat.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Ask him whether he has seen the horse.
    <br>Did you see someone on a horse now?
    <br>From here? No.
    <br>No, he hasn't.
    <br>We are waiting for a horse which was carrying our loved ones.
    <br>When we were coming, the vehicle could not go – we were too many.
    <br>A man with a horse helped to carry two of us; we are waiting for them.
    <br>Where is he living?
    <br>Here.
    <br>OK, this house?
    <br>I hope you will host us today if we cannot go?
    <br>Of course, no problem!

    <br>Occasionally, times can come this way.
    <br>Whatever comes, we have to accept it.
    <br>We went to give food; we are running out of food now.
    <br>We went to give help; we are running out of help now.
    <br>Sometimes, our faith can be tested.
    <br>It is not every time you give help that you will be helped.
    <br>So, this is the man God sent to us this time.
    <br>T.B. Joshua is introduced to the man's family and greets his daughter.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>He wanted to go to the school but it was raining and he couldn't make it there.
    <br>I want to give them this 100 USD.
    <br>Thank you.

    <br>The journey back.
    <br>With the community members waving a fond farewell, the Emmanuel TV team pack up their equipment,
    <br>and set about preparing for their journey back to the city.
    <br>While T.B. Joshua took the path of the mountain roads, due to the muddy conditions,
    <br>the rest of the team were going to travel by river in wooden canoes.
    <br>They are off, down the river.

    <br>Where traditional punting failed, the guides had to get out and physically push the boats
    <br>along the river's shallow course.
    <br>Back to deeper waters, the canoes can start speeding along nicely.

    <br>Even with the unrelenting rain, the level of the river is too low for the canoes
    <br>to use their on-board motors in many places.

    <br>As the skilled guides continue to navigate the long journey,
    <br>you really get the feel of how much a part of their everyday life
    <br>the river is to this community, deep in the jungle.

    <br>At a point, the team has gone as far as they can by river and disembark from the boats.

    <br>on the other side of the river bank to continue on to the city.

    <br>The distinguished guests begin to arrive with their families for the meeting.
    <br>Each of the dignitaries are welcomed warmly by the Emmanuel TV team as they arrive.
    <br>Let us hear a few words from some of the special guests who came to grace the event.
    <br>Engineer Efren Reyes
    <br>Deputy Minister Of Social & Economic Inclusion of Ecuador
    <br>Good evening. My name is Efren Reyes.
    <br>I am from Quito, Ecuador and I am Deputy Minister of Social and Economic Inclusion.
    <br>It is a pleasure for me to be here with Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We thank Emmanuel TV for the invitation to be a part of this event which is very important for us
    <br>because I believe it is the climax of Emmanuel TV’s humanitarian aid in Ecuador.
    <br>Within that was all the relief aid and foodstuffs that were donated to the earthquake victims.
    <br>I joined Emmanuel TV to distribute the relief aid to the shelters, especially in Esmeraldas.
    <br>We found an area in need of help, the indigenous Chachi community which needed a school.
    <br>Made aware of the need, Emmanuel TV helped by building a school for the children.
    <br>We are very happy that now the school is completed and ready
    <br>for the children of the Chachi community to begin their studies.
    <br>It is a pleasure to talk about the reason that we are here.
    <br>We are here because Emmanuel TV has done a lot of things for Ecuador,
    <br>after an earthquake that we suffered last year.
    <br>They helped us with 20 tons of aid relief, that we shared in shelters in Esmeraldas province,
    <br>in coordination with us, the Ministry of Social Inclusion; we helped many families affected by the earthquake.
    <br>Also, Emmanuel TV identified a community that was in need of a school,
    <br>and they decided to do a project to give the opportunity of education
    <br>to the children from the Chachi community.
    <br>It is a pleasure for us to be here.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team is committed to helping those in need.
    <br>This is the reason we have formed this great working team, stronger together.
    <br>I really think that Emmanuel TV Team and T.B. Joshua are great people.
    <br>I can say that we have created a team.
    <br>We have worked together and I have seen that they have these warm feelings for the people,
    <br>this sense of helping others.
    <br>That's why I'm saying that together we are stronger.
    <br>Engineer Efren Reyes
    <br>Deputy Minister Of Social & Economic Inclusion of Ecuador
    <br>Keep watching Emmanuel TV!

    <br>for these 20 tonnes of relief aid, medicine, love and healing that arrived after April, 2016
    <br>when the earthquake struck the Ecuadorian coast with suffering.
    <br>This message of love and seed of care arrived which is reflected in the building of the school
    <br>and hundreds of families that were beneficiaries of these 20 tonnes of aid.
    <br>We are very happy for this.
    <br>We appreciate and celebrate what Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV have done for Ecuador.
    <br>We are here to appreciate those 20 tonnes of aid relief that he sent.
    <br>They were 20 tonnes of love, of help, of charity for our people after the earthquake on April 2016.
    <br>We are here to appreciate him, because he also decided to help the community's children
    <br>by building a new school.
    <br>Colonel Eddy Sanchez
    <br>Councillor Of Quito City Government
    <br>Keep watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>God bless you all.

    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Where will I start from?
    <br>Let’s allow God to direct us.
    <br>With due respect and honour, I would like to recognise some of the dignitaries here before I introduce myself.
    <br>I want to thank you for coming here – a very big thanks.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Now, I can introduce myself.
    <br>I am your brother; my name is T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I am truly humbled and honoured to be here today with my wife, children and some of my team
    <br>and with a high profile humanitarian personality here in our midst with us, the founder of ZAKA.
    <br>Just as we are Emmanuel TV, he is the founder of ZAKA – Israeli Search And Rescue Organisation.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I don’t want to forget how I heard about the trouble in Ecuador.
    <br>I was watching a channel that night and I saw that earthquake
    <br>and I saw children’s schools collapse.
    <br>I said, “Wow!”; I was touched.
    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>I quickly sent a message to all my teams all over the world that they should watch the news,
    <br>that something had happened in Ecuador, that I was touched and that we had to come to rescue.
    <br>This is how our journey began.
    <br>This occasion would not have taken place here without the people of Ecuador,
    <br>the leaders in the school
    <br>and also the leaders in the community of the children’s school.
    <br>I want to say a very big thanks for their support.
    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Knowing God, serving God is helping people.
    <br>When we say we know God, we must help people; we must support people.
    <br>We must make sure whatever we can do to rescue people, we must do it.
    <br>That is serving God.
    <br>For our people, for our children in Ecuador and all over the world,
    <br>it is a pleasure to do every proper thing to support them.
    <br>We are ready to give our life to make sure they remain the leaders of tomorrow.
    <br>This is why we are here.
    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>One thing we need to know about our team -

    <br>I was in Mexico and God really amazed me by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The work that has taken place in Esmeraldas Province -
    <br>we were the foundation that had to put into practice what we had learned from him.
    <br>As a foundation we learned from him; we had an opportunity to apply it when the earthquake happened.
    <br>Publicly, I want to say that the Gospel that I preach changed.
    <br>We can’t preach the Word if we don’t meet the need of others.
    <br>I want to deeply appreciate Prophet T.B. Joshua for what he has done in our province.
    <br>My wife and I want to give you a hug this night.

    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Good evening.
    <br>The truth is that I am not used to speaking much in public.
    <br>But I know that God will give me the perfect words to appreciate this great man.
    <br>I appreciate him on behalf of my people and above all, God.
    <br>As the Word of God says in Psalm 41:1,
    <br>“Blessed is he that considers the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the time of trouble.”
    <br>I thank him so much on behalf of everyone.
    <br>You know how much we have suffered with the earthquake
    <br>but we also know the promise of the Lord that it will not happen again because God is merciful
    <br>and we are praying to Him – the true and living God.
    <br>Everybody knows how much we suffered because of the earthquake,
    <br>but we have the promise of God that something like that will not happen again.
    <br>The mercy and love of God are with us.
    <br>Also many thanks to all the people who joined the pastor in this great work
    <br>because without God’s help, nothing would have been possible.
    <br>We always know that we were never alone because we have a living God
    <br>and His name is the Lord of Hosts.
    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>We also thank all those who joined the Emmanuel TV team to do this job,
    <br>because we know that without the help of God, we would not have been able to do it.
    <br>On behalf of my husband, my family and all the people of this nation, we thank you.

    <br>Cinthia Glas, Wife Of Vice President Of Ecuador Shows Appreciation To T.B. Joshua
    <br>So, finally, we would like to invite the representative of the Chachi community of San Salvador -
    <br>Mr Santiago to come and...
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team Welcomes The Representative Of The Chachi Community
    <br>Good evening, everyone.
    <br>This is a special moment not just for the guests present and the delegation from Emmanuel TV
    <br>but also for the community of San Salvador de Los Chachis for the monumental work
    <br>that we are inaugurating today.
    <br>This is a very special moment, not only for those who are here now - Emmanuel TV team,
    <br>but also for all of the Chachi community.
    <br>The videos and pictures show the process of the construction work and those who participated.
    <br>As you can see on the video and the pictures, they show the process of these amazing contributions.
    <br>The Chachi Community considers and appreciates what T.B. Joshua has done not only physically
    <br>but also spiritually and prophetically.
    <br>Mr Santiago, Chachi Community Representative Appreciates T.B. Joshua For New Ecuador School
    <br>The Chachi community appreciates what Prophet T.B. Joshua has done in our community;
    <br>not only a physical contribution and help - it has been a spiritual and prophetic help.
    <br>I say this because the school that collapsed in the earthquake was built 40 years ago.
    <br>This school was built by the hands of the community members.
    <br>This school is 40 years now and initially it was built by members of the community.
    <br>It was a blessing of God that something that we dreamt of a long time ago
    <br>has come to reality.
    <br>For us it is a great blessing from God, that what we always dreamt of, concerning the school,
    <br>has today materialized in our community.
    <br>The children – over 300 students and 14 teachers are very happy.
    <br>We as a community are also happy because our children don’t have to go through so much
    <br>difficulty in the education process as they had to before.
    <br>Now they have beautiful new classrooms to aid their learning.
    <br>More than 300 children from the school, the teachers and the whole community are very joyful
    <br>because now they can have their education in proper classrooms what they did not have before.
    <br>From the beginning of the construction process, the community joyfully received
    <br>the presence of Emmanuel TV and we had the faith and assurance that the job would be
    <br>carried out with success in line with the vision of the project.
    <br>From the beginning, we were very happy to receive the Emmanuel TV team,
    <br>and we truly believed that this work would be fulfilled.
    <br>We were sure that God was with us and with the power that God gave T.B. Joshua,
    <br>this project would be completed.
    <br>Mr Santiago, Chachi Community Representative Appreciates T.B. Joshua For New Ecuador School
    <br>We were sure that God was with us, and the power that God has given to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>would make this dream come real in our community.
    <br>On behalf of my community and the Chachi people of Ecuador, I want to convey
    <br>this joy and appreciation to T.B. Joshua, the Emmanuel TV team and everyone
    <br>who worked with the foundation as well as the technical team under the architect
    <br>and all those who came together to make this dream come true.
    <br>On behalf of the Chachi community of Ecuador, we appreciate Prophet T.B. Joshua for what he has done,
    <br>and we also appreciate all those who joined in this amazing job.
    <br>The Juan Lorenzo Anapa School Built & Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>On behalf of the community, we also want to express our desire for T.B. Joshua
    <br>with the help of God to continue aiding the needy all over the world
    <br>in disaster-affected areas like ours.
    <br>As a community we want to tell T.B. Joshua, with the help of God, to continue helping the needy,
    <br>when they face this kind of natural disasters.
    <br>We know that in humanitarian work, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Nigeria is a faraway country compared to Ecuador
    <br>but the humanitarian aid reached us and today we have Prophet T.B. Joshua in our midst
    <br>in Ecuador for which we feel very blessed.
    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>We learned that when someone wants to help, there is no barrier, there is no distance,
    <br>because you are coming all the way from Nigeria which is very far to come and help us.
    <br>We really appreciate that.
    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>We are immensely grateful to Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua for
    <br>the magnificent school built in our community.
    <br>Thank you and God bless you.

    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA OPENS SCHOOL IN ECUADOR 2017
    <br>The appreciation ceremony.
    <br>The Rabbi would like to come and say a few words.
    <br>Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav
    <br>Founder, ZAKA – Israeli Search And Rescue
    <br>Good evening, everybody.
    <br>It took us 26 hours of flying to get here for such a special occasion this evening.
    <br>ZAKA’s Rabbi Yehuda Appreciates T.B. Joshua And Greets Ecuadorian Dignitaries
    <br>My organisation, ZAKA, has unfortunately seen a lot of disasters in the last few decades.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>It is so wonderful to go and do things together with Prophet T.B. Joshua in his unique organisation.
    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>It is a privilege and honour that ZAKA and Emmanuel TV – two big organisations -
    <br>gather together to help others around the world.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>The Bible says that God created people; it doesn’t say what colour or what nation they were from.
    <br>He created people and we are supposed to help each and every person
    <br>wherever they are and whatever they believe.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>We are all brothers and are here to help each other in good times and in disasters.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>So, when someone from our family is in trouble, we are here to help in whatever way we can.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>God wants us to work together and help each other by sharing our knowledge and love.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>The Bible says that if you save one life, it is like you have saved the whole world.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>To save lives is not just by giving someone CPR or helping if they have a fracture.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>For the prophet to build a school for the students, they will learn more and teach their children
    <br>and it becomes a project for life.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>Like the prophet said in the meeting with the Vice President, ZAKA is here
    <br>to help you train people so that if this happens again, you can save more lives.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>Government Appreciation Ceremony In Quito For Ecuador School Donated By Emmanuel TV

    <br>Thank you.
    <br>ZAKA’s Founder Rabbi Yehuda Addresses Dignitaries At The Appreciation Ceremony
    <br>So, thank you very much, Rabbi Meshi Zahav, founder of ZAKA.
    <br>And now as we bring the proceedings to a close,
    <br>could we invite the Chachi community to come forward please.

    <br>T.B. JOSHUA OPENS SCHOOL IN ECUADOR 2017
    <br>The opening of the school.
    <br>Let us go back to the last words of T.B. Joshua on the opening day of the school donated by Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We give all glory to God!
    <br>I was with the Vice President yesterday.
    <br>I am going to have another meeting to let him know what I went through to come here today.
    <br>We cannot allow our children to continue like this.
    <br>It is too tense for our children.
    <br>They have to find something to do – most especially on the roads to this place.
    <br>Thank you very much.
