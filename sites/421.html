  <p>    
    <br>You know you have the spirit of witchcraft.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You always threaten this man with 
    <br>divorce; you want to leave the house.
    <br>Yes, it always comes into my mind.
    <br>I have thoughts that I have to commit suicide, that I have to leave him,
    <br>and that I have to make him nothing.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Holy Ghost!
    <br>I want to destroy her.
    <br>I want to destroy her and
    <br>I want to put his name on it.
    <br>You want to do what?
    <br>I want to make him nothing.
    <br>- You want to make him nothing?
    <br>- Yes!
    <br>Why?
    <br>Holy Ghost!
    <br>Talk!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, why do 
    <br>you want to make him nothing?
    <br>He says: "Myself and my family will work for God."
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Holy Ghost, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You say what?
    <br>To destroy him.
    <br>- You want to destroy him?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because he wants to serve God.
    <br>- Because he wants to serve God?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Because you hate him to serve God?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The evil spirits in a woman speaking - that this is the wife of this man.
    <br>The evil spirit says it wants to destroy the husband.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>If she is delivered and this man is not
    <br> delivered, we have not done anything
    <br>because she has deposited something in him.
    <br>So she is delivered and he is delivered.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>You can serve your God.
    <br>- I want to serve my God.
    <br>- You can serve GOD!
    <br>Yes! Hallelujah!
    <br>That is my only ambition: to serve my God to the last moment of my life.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Now you are free!
    <br>Go and give your husband a hug.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Total deliverance for the husband and wife.
    <br>"What the Lord has joined" together...
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You for setting us free and delivering us, Lord!
    <br>We want to serve You, Lord!
    <br>Where there is solution, 
    <br>there is forgiveness.
    <br>Where there is no solution,
    <br> there is no forgiveness.
    <br>This is solution.
    <br>Now, she is a wonderful woman.
    <br>It is the antecedent; it is biological make-up.
    <br>So now she is free, never in your life remind her again -
    <br>no matter what happens in the house.
    <br>If you people disagree,
    <br> that is the area you should not mention.
    <br>If you mention that, you offend God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God!
    <br> Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>She is going to join you in the ministry.
    <br>Yes, she is going to join you.
    <br>Wonderful!
    <br>She is an evangelist.
    <br>She is going to join you in the ministry.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Yes, indeed God is with us.
    <br>My name is Mrs Rina Matthew.
    <br>Next to me is my beloved husband
    <br>Matthew Varughese.
    <br>Next to him is our beloved
    <br>daughter Marylin Matthew.
    <br>We are originally from India 
    <br>but we are living in New Zealand.
    <br>The problem that brought us to
    <br>The SCOAN, Nigeria, was a marital problem.
    <br>Ever since I got married to my husband,
    <br> there was neither peace nor happiness.
    <br>There was always fighting;
    <br>there was a spirit of anger and hatred in me.
    <br>We never met together as
    <br> husband and wife in peace.
    <br>It was just a forceful sleep on
    <br>the same bed.
    <br>I was very angry and I was
    <br>having hatred within me.
    <br>But when the spirit was away from me, I used to pity myself and be very guilty about what I was doing.
    <br>But the moment the spirit came back to me,
    <br>I would be so rebellious and arrogant towards him.
    <br>When the spirit was in me, it was 
    <br>like a hundred-men power within me.
    <br>I could not be controlled by anyone.
    <br>I used to smash utensils, break things, bang the doors and tear clothes.
    <br>It was like a big mess.
    <br>My husband had taken me in
    <br> India to many pastors.
    <br>They said that there was some force in me,
    <br>and they advised me to fast and pray.
    <br>I did 40 days fast, 21 days fast 
    <br>and seven days fast.
    <br>They advised me to do Esther fast,
    <br> which is without water and food
    <br>for three days, and I did it but nothing happened.
    <br>I  was taken for prayers but the
    <br> spirit in me never manifested.
    <br>Once I was back home from the prayer
    <br>I used to fight with my husband telling him:
    <br>"You are insulting me, taking me everywhere and saying that I have got some spirits".
    <br>It was like my husband was just in hell, I can say.
    <br>In the house, it was like in 'hell'
    <br>but when I was outside meeting people,
    <br> I was such a humble person.
    <br>No one would ever think 
    <br>that I had such a behavior.
    <br>I am a nurse. At work, my 
    <br>concentration started diminishing.
    <br>I was not able to concentrate on
    <br> anything I did.
    <br>After eight hours of work, I used to
    <br>run back to the hospital
    <br>to see whether my patients were alright
    <br>and the documentation that I was doing was correct.
    <br>People used to ask me why I 
    <br>used to go back again to the hospital.
    <br>I would say: "Oh no, I forgot something".
    <br>And then I used to check all the documents 
    <br>whether they were correct or not.
    <br>Later, because the trouble was
    <br>too much, we came to New Zealand in 2004.
    <br>Over there also, we went to many pastors,
    <br>they all said that there was some demonic attack,
    <br>but no one was able to deliver me.
    <br>When I was at work in the hospital, 
    <br>my husband used to google
    <br>to find pastors who could deliver me
    <br>and restore our family.
    <br>In 2009, he found our beloved Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>on YouTube, delivering people 
    <br>and that was how we came
    <br>to know about him and ever since
    <br>then we had been trying to come.
    <br>But demons know that this 
    <br>is the arena of liberty
    <br>and whoever steps into it,
    <br>the demons cannot stay on that person.
    <br>So this was what brought you and your husband to The SCOAN,
    <br>and we've seen the cassette of what happened,
    <br>how you were delivered in the name of Jesus.
    <br>So tell us, what was that deliverance like,
    <br>and since then how has life been?
    <br>On the 27th of February 2011,
    <br>it was a Sunday service,
    <br>we were allowed to sit in the front line.
    <br>The moment I was given the seat,
    <br>the spirit within me was
    <br>quite unsettled and was telling me to go back.
    <br>So I told my husband, "I don't 
    <br>want to sit in the front line. Shall I go back?"
    <br>But he just held my hand and said,
    <br>"No, no, no. Don't worry, we'll sit in the front".
    <br>I was a bit disturbed, I didn't want 
    <br>to say something to my husband.
    <br>So the spirit in me said: "Don't worry. You have gone to so many places, you won't be located".
    <br>But thanks be to God, when the man of God just came to me all of a sudden,
    <br>the light that was flashing from the man of God -
    <br>the spirit within me could not withstand that light.
    <br>The spirit was exposed and you have seen the deliverance that has taken place in my life.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>And now since your deliverance, tell us how life has been.
    <br>What have been the changes in your attitude towards your husband, towards the ministry and so on?
    <br>Thanks be to God that I was delivered 
    <br>and ever since then, I have been so light.
    <br>I slept like a baby the same night 
    <br>and ever since then there is no anger and hatred.
    <br>There is love - immense love.
    <br>As our prophet has taught us that 
    <br>we are the sons and daughters of love,
    <br>that same love is flowing through me.
    <br>I love my husband. Ever since then, 
    <br>there was no fight,
    <br>and there is no more confusion in our lives.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>What a wonderful testimony of
    <br>a marriage and a family restored!
    <br>Now tell us, what is your advice to people who are going through the same kind of problem -
    <br>marital problem or marital difficulty all over the world?
    <br>Before that, I would like to say that the man of God prophesied to me,
    <br>saying that I'm going to help my husband with the gospel ministry
    <br>and I'm going to be an evangelist and that prophecy is true.
    <br>God gave me an opportunity for a year to study the Bible,
    <br>and I am sharing the Word to many people.
    <br>Now, I've gone back to my profession as a nurse,
    <br>working in NICU - that is neonatal 
    <br>premature babies in ICU.
    <br>I apply the Anointing Water every day before I go to work.
    <br>I pray with my husband and I take the sticker with me.
    <br>I put it inside my uniform and whenever I touch the babies, there will be miracles taking place.
    <br>Babies are getting healed before the doctors discharge them from the hospital.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You for setting us free and delivering us, Lord. 
    <br>We want to serve You, Lord.
    <br>Where there is solution, there is forgiveness.
    <br>Where there is no solution, there is no forgiveness.
    <br>This is solution.
    <br>Now, she is a wonderful woman.
    <br>It is the antecedent; it is biological make-up.
    <br>So now she is free, never in your life remind her again, no matter what happens in the house.
    <br>If you people disagree, that is 
    <br>an area you should not mention.
    <br>If you mention that, you offend God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>She is going to join you in the ministry.
    <br>Yes, she is going to join you. Wonderful!
    <br>She is an evangelist.
    <br>She is going to join you in the ministry.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus, the Miracle Worker!
    <br>To the whole world, I would like to say especially to my Indian brothers and sisters back in our country,
    <br>it has been taught that being a Christian, demons cannot possess you or attack you.
    <br>That is a wrong teaching, my brothers and sisters.
    <br>Wherever in the family there is trouble, fight, disagreement, anger, alcoholism and smoking,
    <br>it means that you are possessed with demons.
    <br>Demons have invaded your 
    <br>family and you need to be delivered.
    <br>Come to this place, The SCOAN, Nigeria.
    <br>You can spend whatever you have to get yourself delivered,
    <br>to restore your family and everything 
    <br>shall be added unto you.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands 
    <br>together for Jesus once again!
    <br>As we know, The SCOAN is just one of the many living churches all over the world.
    <br>And what our mother is advising 
    <br>us is that we must receive deliverance
    <br>to become a Christian or a truly born-again person.
    <br>You can receive deliverance in any living church
    <br>where the Holy Spirit is in charge all over the world.
    <br>Glory be to God! We thank God for your testimony.
    <br>We would love to hear a word from your husband now.
    <br>Sir, you are very welcome.
    <br>Please introduce yourself and share
    <br>your wonderful testimony with us.
    <br>I'm Matthew Varughese,
    <br>and my wife Rina Matthew and 
    <br>my daughter Marylin Matthew.
    <br>The prophetic message that 
    <br>was given during our deliverance,
    <br>especially for me to serve God,
    <br>and all this drama was taking place
    <br>because of my urge for serving God.
    <br>As the man of God says, faith attracts testing, and I was enduring for so many years.
    <br>We got married to have a good family life but I have seen hell on this earth.
    <br>But God helped me to stand; I only looked to Jesus Christ, who took everything on Himself.
    <br>Every day, I used to pray and read the Bible,
    <br>and that endurance made me to stand my ground.
    <br>Now the thing is that after that prophetic word,
    <br>he said that I should go and serve my GOD!
    <br>That opened a breakthrough for me
    <br>and after that, I have been used by God to pray for others
    <br>and a lot of breakthroughs have come.
    <br>God is using us nicely and I have really been strong enough now.
    <br>I need more grace but then I am strong enough.
    <br>God is helping me to do His work, 
    <br>and I'm happy with my family.
    <br>My wife understands me now; challenges come but we understand each other
    <br>and she is now able to assist me
    <br>in many things.
    <br>Glory be to God. So the prophecy 
    <br>of the man of God has exactly come true.
    <br>You have been able to serve the 
    <br>Lord in spirit and in truth.
    <br>Your ministry has had a breakthrough and your wife is assisting you in her role as an evangelist.
    <br>Is that right?
    <br>Yes, thank you.
    <br>Glory be to God. And what can you say about your wife's character towards you as her husband
    <br>and her character as a wife since the deliverance and the word of prophecy?
    <br>After the deliverance she takes care,
    <br>we sit and discuss so many things, we minister to people together,
    <br>and whenever people call us, we are able to pray together, before we pray for others.
    <br>Most of the situations are like what 
    <br>we have gone through in our life -
    <br>those problems are coming
    <br>so it is very easy to understand.
    <br>And as the man of God says that 
    <br>every cause has got a purpose
    <br>and that is really becoming true in our life,
    <br>and we are going through that.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our 
    <br>hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Pastor, we can see your daughter
    <br>standing next to you here.
    <br>Can you tell us - what changes have you seen between your wife and your daughter
    <br>since the deliverance took place?
    <br>Before the deliverance, the problem 
    <br>was that she was not taken care of.
    <br>She felt always lonely because she is the only child
    <br>who was born to us after seven years of marriage.
    <br>So she was lonely. She was not been taken care of.
    <br>But now after the deliverance, she and her mother are able to give more time to each other,
    <br>and they are having a better understanding
    <br>and we are all happy together.
    <br>Hallelujah. So finally, pastor, give us your word of advice to people watching all over the world -
    <br>both to pastors and to married couples who should seek the face of the Lord.
    <br>I would like to say, Jesus Christ
    <br>is the God whose ministry is restoration.
    <br>As at the marriage of Cana,
    <br>the water was turned to wine,
    <br>when a family had the
    <br>problem of being short of wine.
    <br>And then Jesus was there. When we call upon Jesus Christ, He will make a way for us.
    <br>So never ever quit, stay in faith, call upon God; 
    <br>ask, seek, and knock.
    <br>And definitely God will make a way for you 
    <br>and He will deliver you.
    <br>Let's put our hands together
    <br>for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My name is Marilyn Matthew.
    <br>I'm from New Zealand. 
    <br>This is my mother Rina Matthew,
    <br>and that is my father Matthew Varughese.
    <br>In 2012, I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God prophesied that the same spirit
    <br>that was haunting my mother was also haunting me.
    <br>I can testify to that. Yes, it was haunting me
    <br>because there were so many things that I did.
    <br>I felt anger and frustration
    <br>that I never used to feel before.
    <br>After the man of God prophesied to me,
    <br>I got delivered.
    <br>I was set free. After that, there is
    <br> happiness and peace in our family.
    <br>Hallelujah. So what would be your word of advice
    <br>to families watching you all over the world?
    <br>I would like to give advice to children because sometimes, when your parents are fighting
    <br>or your family is going through a bad situation, children are mostly affected.
    <br>And I want to tell them to hold on to Jesus, to pray to Jesus.
    <br>He will surely hear your prayers.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Wonderful! You have demonstrated and you have experienced
    <br>that earth has no sorrow that Heaven does not feel.
    <br>When God Almighty is aware of your situation, He will not leave you without a solution.
    <br>And as God has met you at the point of your need
    <br>and is taking you from grace 
    <br>to grace and faith to faith,
    <br>we pray God Almighty will give you that grace to remain in His Word,
    <br>abide in His Word and allow the Word to abide in you
    <br>that this will be permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
