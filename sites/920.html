  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you.
    <br>I know the thoughts of your heart; I mean, the disposition.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I release healing - that organ of yours, I command it to be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every infirmity, be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Satan, remove your hand from this man!
    <br>Remove your hand from this woman!
    <br>Remove your hand from my people!
    <br>You satan, I say, remove your hand from their business, career - remove your hand!
    <br>All knees shall bow at the name of Jesus.
    <br>I command you to remove your hand!
    <br>You satan, remove your hand from their career, business - remove your hand!
    <br>I can see you being released!
    <br>Everything that has been bound, be loosed!
    <br>Satan, I am waiting. Time to wait.
    <br>Pack your things, pack your load, your activities - I say, leave my people!
    <br>Leave my people, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>
