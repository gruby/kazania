  <p>    
    <br>You have received Jesus, but there is a spirit of snake that is disturbing you.
    <br>Deliver me, man of God.
    <br>Coming under the delivering influence of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>he falls to the ground, no longer able to hold himself under the power of deliverance.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua offers Spirit prayer,
    <br>the young man's body begins to shake and convulse
    <br>as the spirit of snake manifests
    <br>and is driven out by the authority of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Out!
    <br>MARTIAL ARTS SNAKE TATTOO
    <br>Personal Prophecy T.B. Joshua
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>See the brother under the delivering influence of the Holy Spirit right now.
    <br>This is the young man that received a prophecy
    <br>that he has accepted Jesus, but the spirit of a snake still disturbs him.
    <br>You can see that snake-like movement.
    <br>MARTIAL ARTS SNAKE TATTOO
    <br>Personal Prophecy T.B. Joshua
    <br>It is over today; he is free.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Write it down: The Lord wants to use you. Okay?
    <br>Because, remember the home you come from.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>There is a platform in your home.
    <br>Okay, man of God.
    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>My name is Timothy Rodriguez.
    <br>I'm from South Africa.
    <br>The man of God came to me during the service and said I had definitely accepted Jesus,
    <br>but I had not received full deliverance from the spirit of snake.
    <br>You have received Jesus, but there is a spirit of snake that is disturbing you.
    <br>How can you confirm this prophesy to be true?
    <br>I used to do martial arts and that was my whole life.
    <br>From doing that, I allowed the spirit of snake into my body.
    <br>I even got a tattoo representing the martial arts that I did.
    <br>And I can confirm that I had a spirit of snake inside me
    <br>because I was very aggressive and my life was different when I was doing martial arts.
    <br>I got involved in it as a sport,
    <br>but I didn't realise that there was a spiritual side to it.
    <br>There was a lot of meditation and drawing on energy from a source - obviously not God.
    <br>Basically, when you are doing your patterns you would draw power from demons, from contrary spirits.
    <br>How did that spirit really affect your life?
    <br>It changed me a lot. I was very aggressive and got into a lot of fights.
    <br>I was always fighting people. I was just a different person.
    <br>I fought in tournaments and on the streets, anywhere.
    <br>Anyone that would provoke you, you would just fight them?
    <br>Yes, that's true.
    <br>MARTIAL ARTS SNAKE TATTOO
    <br>Personal Prophecy T.B. Joshua
    <br>These three symbols that I have got here represent the martial arts I used to do.
    <br>The man of God said that you had accepted Jesus, but that you were not fully delivered. What can you say about this?
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>When I accepted Jesus, I did receive deliverance at a church,
    <br>but obviously there was still something left behind
    <br>and I am grateful that God completely took it all out of me, using the man of God.
    <br>When the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prayed for you what happened?
    <br>I started almost unwinding.
    <br>Some spirit was coming out of me -
    <br>the little bit that was left of it.
    <br>It wasn't voluntary.
    <br>It was just as if something was coming out of my body.
    <br>How are you feeling after the prayer now?
    <br>I'm feeling good!
    <br>He also said that God wants to use me
    <br>and I should remember the platform that I came from.
    <br>And write it down: The Lord wants to use you.
    <br>Because remember the home you come from.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>There's a platform in your home.
    <br>Okay, man of God.
    <br>That's definitely true because since I gave my life to Christ,
    <br>that's all my life has been about - it's just living for Him.
    <br>And I'm grateful to get a word like that.
    <br>How do you feel that the man of God said that God wants to use you?
    <br>I feel good. I feel great about that.
    <br>That's what I want to do with my life.
    <br>- That's been your heart's desire?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>I'm feeling good; I am delivered, in Jesus name.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your deliverance.
