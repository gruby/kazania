    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>When you were a student, you were in a cult.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>- If I'm right?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Nobody has delivered you; you just decided not to show interest and live a 'free' life.
    <br>You know it is a thing of the spirit – it is affecting you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You were in a very strong cult, you even headed the cult members.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I want to see you.
    <br>I want to be your friend.
    <br>You can imagine somebody walking towards you and saying, "You are in a secret cult".
    <br>That cannot be an imagination because things of a secret cult is not something you can just see,
    <br>if you are not "spirit-filled".
    <br>But this was discovered by a mere handshake.
    <br>I stretched my hand and he stretched his hand.
    <br>I felt that strange light in myself.
    <br>I said, "No. What is this? This is not one of us. It pretends to be light, but it is not light. He is not one of us.
    <br>He is the opposite. Oh yes!"
    <br>This is just it.
    <br>And not just...
    <br>He is very strong.
    <br>Not just a member of a cult but a very strong one.
    <br>By what happened to him, you will know that he is a very strong occultic master.
    <br>Very strong.
    <br>Let's listen why he is in a strong cult and who this man is.
    <br>My name is Samuel Adisa.
    <br>I was here last Sunday.
    <br>During the service the man of God prophesied to me.
    <br>The woman beside me is my new partner.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God just walked up to me and said, "You were in a cult, when you were a student".
    <br>I was looking at him.
    <br>He said, "This has really destroyed you so much. I want to be your friend".
    <br>I confirmed this to be true.
    <br>When I was in "primary 5", my grandmother called me and said that she wanted to tell me a secret
    <br>that I should not tell anybody.
    <br>I said, "Momma, what is that secret?"
    <br>She said, "Your mother had several stillbirths. Because of this, I and your grandfather
    <br>took you to a witchdoctor to rededicate your life, to redeem you so you would not die".
    <br>I told my momma, "What does it have to do with my life now?"
    <br>She said that she wanted to give me some warning, that from now on there would be some things
    <br>manifesting in my life according to the instruction given to them.
    <br>That I would be seeing ladies around me, running after me.
    <br>As they wanted to redeem me, the witchdoctor told us to go out
    <br>to look for a beautiful lady's menstrual pad and a male dog.
    <br>They would use all of this to do that.
    <br>She said they had given them seven days to get all of this.
    <br>On the fifth day, when she could not find a beautiful lady's pad, she saw that there was a neighbour
    <br>who she met in the bathroom - this lady was a divorcee.
    <br>She put her menstrual pad on the ground after taking her bath.
    <br>My grandmother picked the menstrual pad and took it to the witchdoctor.
    <br>They used it to do a sacrifice to save my life.
    <br>As I was growing up, according to what momma told me,
    <br>I began to see ladies, even older than me, in the school.
    <br>People would be coming around me.
    <br>All of the sudden, I would find myself in the night...
    <br>In the dream, I would find myself in the midst of people - having a meeting with them, like at a conference.
    <br>Then, I began to study things that happened in the dream.
    <br>There were some incantations they would make in my dreams.
    <br>When I came to the physical world, I would be making declarations of all those things to my mates.
    <br>This would be happening immediately.
    <br>People around me would see that I had powers. They would come and ask me to enlighten them about all this.
    <br>One of my teachers called me one day.
    <br>That day, one of the other students offended me.
    <br>I told that boy, "You will fall into the well and drown".
    <br>To me, I just uttered these words.
    <br>Grandma had warned me to never utter any negative words to my family members.
    <br>Anybody that offended me - anything I told them would come to pass.
    <br>In less than five minutes, some of the teachers called me, asking what power I was using.
    <br>The boy I declared to fall into the well and drown is now in the well. People are shouting for his rescue.
    <br>He asked me to resolve this matter and bring the boy out.
    <br>The following day, one of the teachers called me to his office.
    <br>He asked me, "Do you know that you have a crown on your head?"
    <br>I said, "Yes, sir".
    <br>He asked, "What is the implication of this crown?"
    <br>I said, "I don't know. I used to see this golden crown with seven stars on my head, even physically".
    <br>She said that she would let me know the implication of this and interpret this better for me.
    <br>That is how she used to invite me to her house, where she would also invite another occult master.
    <br>The man acted like a herbalist.
    <br>He was telling me to say some things, examining it whether it would become true.
    <br>After then, I went to secondary school, at which time that power was already a part of me.
    <br>I felt as if I was superior - I began to act like this.
    <br>When I finished my secondary school, I began to look for ladies.
    <br>I had no control over this.
    <br>Any lady I talked to...
    <br>I never saw a lady that could deny me.
    <br>Whoever I wanted to talk to, any kind of woman - they would submit to me - even the older ladies.
    <br>I believed it was a good power given to me.
    <br>Before I finished my secondary school...
    <br>My mother is a pastor.
    <br>She began to be worried - she realised that there was something wrong with me.
    <br>I would leave the house at any time and go to people I used to have meetings with.
    <br>She began to take me to different prayer houses.
    <br>There, they asked me what my problem was.
    <br>She was taking me to church all the time.
    <br>She would wake me at midnight to recite Bible quotations.
    <br>I refused to open up to her because of what grandma had told me - not to tell anything.
    <br>When I finished my secondary school...
    <br>Before I finished it, God had really blessed me - I accumulated a lot of wealth.
    <br>All of a sudden, I began to encounter one problem or the other.
    <br>The first business got liquidated.
    <br>Then, I travelled to the northern part of the country.
    <br>When I got there, I was looking for means of this...
    <br>There, I began to see people coming around me.
    <br>Again, ladies of different caliber.
    <br>They used to give me anything I needed.
    <br>I took it as another opportunity to enjoy myself.
    <br>This is how I was living my life.
    <br>Later, God blessed me again - I accumulated money again.
    <br>I joined three companies as a distributor.
    <br>In 2005 I met a lady who was seeking assistance from me.
    <br>I regarded her as a beautiful lady.
    <br>I approached her and she got pregnant.
    <br>She was living with me.
    <br>All of a sudden...
    <br>I never knew that she had another way of doing things.
    <br>Before I knew it, the whole business got liquidated, to the extent that I had a debt of 10 million naira.
    <br>I found a way - I sent her away.
    <br>That is how I was going on with my life, looking for a way to survive.
    <br>Last year, I met this lady here.
    <br>I approached her; I wanted to settle down with her.
    <br>I got divorced 10 years ago.
    <br>I told her I wanted to marry her and she agreed.
    <br>She often asked me if there was anything that would make me not to marry her.
    <br>I told her that if I saw my lady with any other man, I would send her out of my life and would get another one.
    <br>She told me that I should not worry and that there was something she wanted to tell me.
    <br>I went with her to her village - we came back on Saturday.
    <br>On Sunday morning she said she wanted to go to The SCOAN.
    <br>I asked, "For what? You have never been there. Why now?"
    <br>She said she wanted to be there.
    <br>She left and I refused to follow her.
    <br>When she came back, she told me that she had got the Anointing Water.
    <br>I told her not to spray it on me, not to put it on my clothes or on anything in this house.
    <br>She answered, "No problem".
    <br>After some few days, in the middle of the night, I felt a sensation on me - as if somebody sprayed a perfume on me.
    <br>I woke up from a deep sleep and asked, "What is happening here?"
    <br>The following day I called her and asked, "Did you minister the Anointing Water on me?"
    <br>She said, "Yes. What is your problem? Is it not an anointed water?"
    <br>I said, "OK. Don't do that again".
    <br>I fell asleep and had a dream - I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua in that dream.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He appeared to me and told me the history of my life.
    <br>Every lady I dated before and that I was ready to marry then -
    <br>I rejected them because they were either married before or I caught them with other men.
    <br>The Prophet was telling me about the lifestyle of these persons,
    <br>"This person lied to you that she is a single girl. These are her children".
    <br>I would see her children lined up before her. I would see all of them.
    <br>Coming to the lady standing beside me - I saw her too.
    <br>I saw three children before her.
    <br>I was confused, "No, this is a single girl. Although she told me she had been married and is a divorcee,
    <br>she never told me she had any children".
    <br>I called her and told her that I was not happy.
    <br>She said, "What happened?"
    <br>I said, "I had a dream. I wouldn't say that it was a nightmare. I saw children before you".
    <br>She said that these might be the children she would born for me.
    <br>I said, "OK".
    <br>All the children I saw resembled her so much.
    <br>Two days later, in the morning, she called me and told me that she wanted to tell me something.
    <br>I asked, "What is that?"
    <br>She said, "I told you I was a divorcee".
    <br>I said, "Yes".
    <br>She said, "OK. I want to tell you something.
    <br>If we are to go on with this marriage, let's go on with the marriage. If you want to break it, then break it.
    <br>I have three children".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I was battered.
    <br>I looked at my life - every lady I approached would tell me at the beginning that they were single,
    <br>at the end I would learn they had children.
    <br>My mind went back to what grandma had told me -
    <br>when she was looking for a menstrual pad of a beautiful lady,
    <br>she could not find it for five days, until she met a divorcee at her place.
    <br>It was the menstrual pad of that lady she used.
    <br>I told her, "OK, no problem. I will meditate on it".
    <br>She asked me what my decision was.
    <br>I said, "Don't worry. I can't conclude the matter now. I will talk to you later".
    <br>Last Sunday, I was in the house.
    <br>She called me again, saying that I needed to be at The SCOAN.
    <br>I asked, "To go there and do what?"
    <br>She said, "Is it not a house of God? Aren't you a Christian?"
    <br>I said, "I am a Christian. You can go. It is you who has a problem, not me".
    <br>She insisted and I followed her here.
    <br>When I got here, I was surprised to see the man of God walking towards me.
    <br>He began to tell me about the life I lived in the past.
    <br>I want the man of God to help me to get my deliverance.
    <br>I was already fed up with my life in 2005.
    <br>The only daughter that the first lady got for me...
    <br>There was a time I was fed up - I took this girl to the forest and I discharged the power into her.
    <br>At that time the girl was 4 years old.
    <br>That is my only daughter.
    <br>Since then...
    <br>She is 10 years old now.
    <br>Since then, people would call me...
    <br>The girl is staying with my mum, who is a pastor.
    <br>I allowed her to stay with her because I knew that what was happening to me might end up happening to her.
    <br>People, including my sister, were calling me, saying that the teacher in the school was suspecting
    <br>my daughter to be possessed.
    <br>Anytime they would bring this matter, I would dispel it and say that I don't want to hear anything about this.
    <br>Two or three weeks ago, my younger sister brought my daughter to Lagos and she told me,
    <br>"Brother, your daughter is very brilliant. She takes first or second position in her class but there is a question mark".
    <br>I asked, "What is this question mark?"
    <br>She said that when they went to churches, they would tell them that the girl was possessed.
    <br>In her school, some other girls accused her of initiating them.
    <br>I want the man of God to help me, to get my deliverance here.
    <br>OK. You mentioned your former wife - what were you saying?
    <br>I told you that there is a woman who has a child for me – one daughter – in the past
    <br>and I divorced her when I discovered that my business was liquidating because of her intervention.
    <br>It has been over 10 years since I saw her last.
    <br>Is that the only one you had in the past?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Or do you have more than that?
    <br>No!
    <br>It is 10 years now.
    <br>The daughter is 10 years because that girl was 1 year and 3 months when she left.
    <br>She left or you asked her to leave?
    <br>I asked her to leave when I saw the way things were going.
    <br>My sister - whatever you are, something good has come out from you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If not you, we wouldn't be talking about this man today.
    <br>You came here searching for salvation and you received the Morning Water.
    <br>You got home and you know the type of man you have.
    <br>He warned you not to minister this water at all.
    <br>But for better...
    <br>You said, "Whatever will happen, let it happen".
    <br>You studied him when he was sleeping and you ministered it.
    <br>He woke up crying, "Why do you minister this?"
    <br>That was the beginning of his deliverance.
    <br>The following day, he had the dream concerning you.
    <br>Yes, it was that Morning Water you ministered that changed the mind of this man
    <br>and the man came to The Synagogue.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This man came to The Synagogue today, and he was discovered and delivered.
    <br>If not, he would not be able to stand - somebody who has a contrary spirit -
    <br>he would not even want to come here.
    <br>When he had warned you that he didn't want to hear anything about The Synagogue -
    <br>but he is here today.
    <br>Can you tell us - what is your mission?
    <br>Are you purposed to marry this man and that is why you are doing this, or you just want him to be safe, or...
    <br>Tell us what is going on.
    <br>Who is this man to you and who are you?
    <br>The reason I'm asking this question is -
    <br>if you actually have the mind to marry this man, you would not have told him you didn't have any child at all,
    <br>whereas you have three.
    <br>And you knew that sooner or later the truth will come out.
    <br>This is what we don't know.
    <br>If you have lied and lied, the day the truth will come out, it will spoil everything you have been doing.
    <br>My name is Ngozi Ogbanya.
    <br>I am from Ebonyi State, Nigeria.
    <br>I got married in 2005.
    <br>The man I married never told me that he had another wife.
    <br>Who is that man?
    <br>My former husband.
    <br>Don't tell us about that one.
    <br>When I meet you one on one, we will discuss it.
    <br>Tell us only about the man standing by you.
    <br>Don't worry, I will see you one on one.
    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>I met him in 2005 - I was sick.
    <br>Somebody directed me to him.
    <br>When I met him last year, we developed a relationship.
    <br>He said he would marry me.
    <br>I asked him if there was anything that would make him not to marry me.
    <br>He said, no - unless he caught me with any other man.
    <br>I said, "I will tell you something".
    <br>Then, I asked him about his past life.
    <br>He said he was married to a lady, and that person had a boy about whom he never knew.
    <br>Later, he noticed that this person was married to another person.
    <br>I told him my own story.
    <br>What was the story?
    <br>Just in a nutshell.
    <br>I told him that I was married to a person who had never told me that he had another woman.
    <br>I discovered it six months later.
    <br>I went back to my parents - they took me back to that place.
    <br>I was never happy with the marriage; I kept grumbling all the time.
    <br>I thought of committing suicide.
    <br>I bought a poison - a rat killer - to drink it.
    <br>Don't worry about that.
    <br>OK, it's alright.
    <br>You love this man so much?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Is it love of a husband and wife, or just what is happening out there?
    <br>I love him with the love of husband and wife.
    <br>OK, why...
    <br>If you love him so dearly with the love of husband and wife...
    <br>The love of husband and wife is from the heart.
    <br>Why were you hiding the three children?
    <br>Sir...
    <br>Look, he would have even been a father to those children, helping you to take care of them.
    <br>That would not make him to say no.
    <br>He himself has told you that he has a child outside.
    <br>That was an opportunity for you to tell him about your children outside.
    <br>This is the thing that spoiled everything.
    <br>Sir, I was just afraid.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Who is this lady to you?
    <br>I took her to be my fiancée that I would get married to.
    <br>She annoyed me hiding these three kids.
    <br>OK, now you know she has three children.
    <br>That is why I want God to speak.
    <br>You said you have a wife somewhere.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>And you haven't seen your wife for the past 10 years?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>That is the one that gave birth to my child.
    <br>OK, you haven't seen her for 10 years?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>She gave a birth to a child?
    <br>A daughter.
    <br>A daughter?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>OK.
    <br>The last week you came here - I want to know whether our sister was here in the church.
    <br>Yes, she was in the church.
    <br>OK.
    <br>You know, in order to deliver you and our sister we have to go an extra mile.
    <br>When we interrogated you, we collected the telephone number of the sister you were talking about.
    <br>Now, we hear that she gave birth to a child.
    <br>There is no deliverance we can do here, while a child is out there.
    <br>For ten years no one stood to be a father to this child - God will not answer any prayer we will offer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will be very surprised to learn that the lady you haven't seen for ten years is inside the church.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>For the past ten years you haven't seen her - you will see her now, with the (child).
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>... with the child.
    <br>You have not seen her for 10 years.
    <br>The purpose of deliverance is for you to be set free.
    <br>Whilst you were undergoing deliverance, we interrogated you.
    <br>We asked you; "You have a child? You have a wife?"
    <br>Even if it was 50 years ago and they are still alive - we have to trace such a person
    <br>and to ask God for forgiveness.
    <br>We do not do that to separate the two of you but to bring everybody to the table.
    <br>You want to say something?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Having heard that you said that she is in the church...
    <br>No, I am not even asking you any question - don't worry.
    <br>OK, don't worry.
    <br>Don't be afraid.
    <br>Nobody can force you - God cannot force you.
    <br>You have discretion.
    <br>God cannot do anything without asking for your faith.
    <br>God will not say, "Take it!" - no.
    <br>Even God cannot force us.
    <br>That is why He gave us discretion that we can choose.
    <br>When He met this man at the pool of Bethesda, He asked, "What can I do for you?"
    <br>If the man had said, "No, I don't want You to do anything for me", Jesus would have said, "OK".
    <br>He will not force you.
    <br>What is not done well is not done at all.
    <br>If we just make it half-way - deliver both of you and send you out -
    <br>what about that woman and the child?
    <br>If she didn't have a child for you - no problem.
    <br>Can you call the woman out?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brother, you are supposed to be the happiest person in our midst, or even in the world.
    <br>I don't know you, you don't know me.
    <br>It was on Sunday, I saw you sitting down there - and I don't know anbody but Jesus who can do this.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is only Jesus who can do this.
    <br>Ten years now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ten years now.
    <br>God used my sister to minister the Morning Water and to bring you here.
    <br>If not my sister, you would not come here.
    <br>We are not doing that to humiliate you but to set everyone of us free.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>Can I ask my brother a question?
    <br>Do you know this lady?
    <br>I don't know this one.
    <br>How old is the other one?
    <br>Ten years, sir.
    <br>On my way here, I asked my sister to bring her here for deliverance.
    <br>OK.
    <br>So I don't know this one.
    <br>OK, it's alright, don't worry.
    <br>But you know this woman?
    <br>I know her very well.
    <br>It is the woman you were talking about?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>OK, it's alright.
    <br>Rest your peace.
    <br>OK, it's alright.
    <br>The daughter they are talking about is living with his mum?
    <br>Yes, she is living with his mum.
    <br>She was 1 year and 7 months old when they collected her from me.
    <br>She will be 10 years old in August.
    <br>She will be 10 years old in August?
    <br>OK.
    <br>If I give you just 3 minutes, you have to say everything in truth and in faith, OK?
    <br>I am Mary Adolor.
    <br>I am from Edo State, Nigeria.
    <br>This man standing by me is my husband, the father of my children.
    <br>I have a child for him - that is Precious, my first daughter.
    <br>Along the line we started having problems - the women issue.
    <br>A friend would come and visit me.
    <br>Before I knew it, my husband would see her off, befriend her and fall in love with her.
    <br>All my friends were going out with him.
    <br>That is where the problem started.
    <br>When this problem started, I didn't know that he was looking for a way to chase me out.
    <br>Then, he said that I should pack my things.
    <br>At that time I was pregnant for 1 month and 2 weeks.
    <br>This is that very girl.
    <br>He sent me out of his house to the village.
    <br>I went to my mother's place - I stayed there and gave birth to this girl.
    <br>He never asked about her or even called.
    <br>I picked his mum's number and called her.
    <br>I still had his mum's number then.
    <br>I told her that I was pregnant.
    <br>She said that she was happy.
    <br>I don't know when my husband told her that he was not responsible for that pregnancy.
    <br>When I put to bed, I called them, thinking that the mother or any member of the family would come.
    <br>His mother called me back and said that my husband said that he was not responsible for this pregnancy.
    <br>I said, "Mummy, what are you saying?"
    <br>She said that that was what her son had told her.
    <br>I said, "OK, if you say so. I will take care of her".
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>The 3 minutes I've given you - I think you have explained everything.
    <br>My sister here - she is my daughter.
    <br>The issue of marriage is not even to be discussed now.
    <br>Put the issue of marriage behind you.
    <br>I don't believe that, unless you are completely set free.
    <br>Madam, forget about marrying this man.
    <br>You too, you need to be set free first.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My sister, please - you need to be fortified.
    <br>Come and stand here.
    <br>You have to be alone - you are not married now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After your deliverance, you can decide what to do with your life.
    <br>The issue of marrying this man you are living with - remove it from the record.
    <br>You need to be set free.
    <br>When you are set free, we will talk.
    <br>You are a beautiful woman - look in the mirror.
    <br>When the lady is delivered, people will be looking for her, not her looking for people.
    <br>That is our real value.
    <br>What about this little one?
    <br>This is the only daughter that I know of.
    <br>This is my younger sister.
    <br>OK.
    <br>OK, this is the...?
    <br>The daughter.
    <br>You are the mother?
    <br>She is my daughter.
    <br>She is your mother?
    <br>No.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Give me your hand.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>Precious.
    <br>Look at her, look at this woman.
    <br>Who is she?
    <br>She is not my mummy.
    <br>Who is she?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>When did you see this young lady the last time?
    <br>It is 8 years now.
    <br>She will be 10 years in August.
    <br>You can see the reason why she says that she doesn't know you?
    <br>I know.
    <br>She cannot know you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK.
    <br>I want you to come next Sunday and give testimony of your freedom.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>God is in control.
    <br>Take my mother.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Please, take care of my brother.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Give me...
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Come on here!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Who are you?!
    <br>I will set you free today.
    <br>It is a lie!
    <br>Who are you?!
    <br>You can't deliver her; leave her for me.
    <br>I have destroyed her.
    <br>What have you done to her, her marriage, her family?
    <br>No matter how beautiful she is – no man.
    <br>I want to start from her - from one to two to three.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Who are you?!
    <br>I am the husband.
    <br>Husband, you listen to that.
    <br>I married her when she was young.
    <br>Her mother gave her to me.
    <br>Leave her alone!
    <br>Leave her!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>She did not marry the right person she was supposed to marry.
    <br>I made her life useless.
    <br>It is her that I want to destroy because she is my wife.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>When she was small.
    <br>So, leave her for me; you cannot deliver her.
    <br>I have married her – for years.
    <br>I destroyed her.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Her family – the parents disowned her.
    <br>I am sitting down there.
    <br>You think you can deliver her.
    <br>Leave her for me!
    <br>I made her to lie, here and there.
    <br>What kind of lie - explain!
    <br>She says what is not true because I want to marry her.
    <br>I have destroyed her.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Oh, this is momma.
    <br>Thank you very much, Momma.
    <br>You heard my call and you are here - thank you.
    <br>You can just come here.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Oh, this is our mum - thank you.
    <br>Glory be to God - this is my sister.
    <br>My sister is delivered, finally - she is free now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She is free.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are a beautiful woman.
    <br>It is satan who was trying to play a funny game.
    <br>You are a beautiful woman.
    <br>Now, after you deliverance, you might have discovered yourself -
    <br>"Why me of all this rubbish? Why me of all this?"
    <br>I want to be there for you.
    <br>The Lord will give you a wonderful husband and you will settle down.
    <br>OK.
    <br>All the previous journey is just your past.
    <br>It has become past.
    <br>Like I told you - I don't see you and this man - it is just trouble.
    <br>He has his own trouble, you have your trouble.
    <br>Now, the deliverance has come - you people cannot come together.
    <br>Your future now - I know that when you come back next time - big testimony.
    <br>She has been in the church since last Sunday.
    <br>She has been in the church.
    <br>So, I needed to bring you out.
    <br>I was not supposed to bring you out - but I needed to tell the world that all this is your past.
    <br>So please, thank you very much.
    <br>You go and have your seat.
    <br>It is no longer anything to you.
    <br>If you people have anything in common like house, money or whatever, we will iron it out.
    <br>That kind of relationship of husband and wife - God is not aware.
    <br>So, my brother, mummy - thank you for coming.
    <br>We thank God - satan is a liar.
    <br>My brother is free now.
    <br>My sister too, the former wife is here.
    <br>We told them after the service that this marriage cannot come together again.
    <br>You two cannot come together as a husband and wife.
    <br>The revelation God has given to me is: "Take care of your children."
    <br>OK?
    <br>If anybody is telling you that there is no link between you and this little girl,
    <br>the person doesn't want good for you.
    <br>It is just some of the things that happened to you in the past.
    <br>This is why I'm here to tell momma.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What I'm saying - this is the mother of this little girl.
    <br>Because last Sunday we were asking the little girl.
    <br>She said, "No, this is not my mother. I don't know her".
    <br>I said it was her mother.
    <br>Now, God has forgiven us and we are delivered.
    <br>Old things have passed away.
    <br>We should put everything behind us.
    <br>She should have access to her daughter.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Last Sunday the mother was asking if she could be with her daughter, I said, "No,  we need to see momma".
    <br>Momma is the one that has been with the daughter.
    <br>I needed to meet momma before this kind of agreement can come.
    <br>Momma needs to be aware of what is on the ground.
    <br>Momma is here.
    <br>We thank God and we thank momma.
    <br>Thank God, momma is a pastor.
    <br>This is a pastor.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>And you know that forgiveness gives us future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, what else again?
    <br>Whether their sin is big or small - forgive them.
    <br>Big sin, small sin - forgive them.
    <br>Therefore - big, bigger, biggest sin - forgive them.
    <br>So, that is it.
    <br>Forgive them - this includes you and me.
    <br>That it is - we put everything behind us.
    <br>So, the wife has to have access to her daughter.
    <br>So, we let the daughter know that this is her mother.
    <br>Till now, she has been grumbling.
    <br>After the service we will meet and eat together at the round table.
    <br>This kind of meeting is not to marry her or him but to acknowledge that this is her mother.
    <br>The mother should have access to her daughter.
    <br>There is another secret - something is going on.
    <br>This little one...
    <br>I say that as a man of God: if somebody is telling us something, we should not listen to him or to her.
    <br>Their evidence is nothing to go by.
    <br>It is God who we should listen to.
    <br>He is the father of this girl.
    <br>I am telling you - he is the father.
    <br>I am not listening to her mum, the woman there - I can't listen to her.
    <br>His evidence too - it is nothing to go by.
    <br>But God - that is evidence from God - he is the father.
    <br>Take care of this girl. The same way as you take care of this daughter.
    <br>Like I have said - it is all what God demands to open the door of the future.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>What's your name?
    <br>Victory.
    <br>You are the mother?
    <br>OK, thank you for coming.
    <br>I am happy for your coming here today.
    <br>Momma there and momma here - we have to be very careful about the issue of this marriage.
    <br>Whatever God says is final.
    <br>OK?
    <br>You have done your own marriage and this is their own.
    <br>Whatever situation that is at hand, let us ask God.
    <br>OK?
    <br>This is why I want to meet you after the service and to have a meeting with you people.
    <br>We are not having this meeting so that the two of them can get back together - no, there is nothing like that.
    <br>It is about the acceptance of this little girl.
    <br>The mother should also have access to the daughter.
    <br>So, thank you very much.
    <br>OK?
    <br>That is the next meeting immediately after the service.
    <br>OK, thank you, Momma.
    <br>Thank you for coming here.
    <br>Little one.
    <br>And this little one needs deliverance and maybe we will do that, OK?
    <br>Give me your hand.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Come on, sit down.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE.
    <br>My name is Samuel Adisa.
    <br>These are my children, my wife, my mother and my mother-in-law.
    <br>I want to thank God for how He intervened in my issues.
    <br>Earlier, before I came to The SCOAN, I had spiritual problems and setback in my business.
    <br>When I came to this church, the man of God prophesied to me that I was an occultist when I was in school,
    <br>and this has really affected my business.
    <br>This also affected my life because I was not delivered.
    <br>That day, God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver me.
    <br>After the deliverance, I have seen the mighty hand of God on me.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God for what He has done in your life.
    <br>We just want to, for the benefit of those who are watching us today for the first time...
    <br>You mentioned that came to The SCOAN and you received a message of prophecy
    <br>from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, mentioning that you were an occultist in the past.
    <br>Could you just put a bit of light on this and explain, in confirmation of this prophecy, how it was true in your life.
    <br>Yes, I can confirm this to be true.
    <br>The man of God spoke to me, saying that I was an occultist in my school days.
    <br>It all happened when I was around 13 years old.
    <br>My grandmother called me and began to tell me about my past lifestyle.
    <br>When I was young, they took me to some herbalists to initiate me into some spirits.
    <br>I was a still-born baby and they didn't want that anything would happen to me.
    <br>As I was growing up, I began to see myself mingling with people, using spirits to control people -
    <br>whatever I said would come to pass - so I believed this spirit was helping me,
    <br>not knowing that this spirit was causing harm to my destiny.
    <br>I didn't know about it till the moment I came to The SCOAN and the man of God prophesied to me
    <br>that this was really affecting my life.
    <br>He prayed for me and delivered me that day.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>After your deliverance from that spirit of occultism, that had really been affecting your life and your business,
    <br>as you mentioned - could you tell us how did you feel immediately after your deliverance?
    <br>Yes, I can confirm this to be true that after the man of God delivered me I have been seeing light in my life.
    <br>Most of the nightmares I used to have - they are no more.
    <br>I feel renewed and I see the light of God being restored in my life.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Now, after you received your deliverance at The SCOAN
    <br>and the man of God invited these people standing next to you, can you explain to us what is the purpose of all this?
    <br>The prophecy about the people standing here -
    <br>the prophecy about my daughter that I had disowned since birth and denied to be her father.
    <br>When the man of God intervened, he sought the face of God, and I learned that she is my legitimate daughter.
    <br>God has really used His prophet to join me with my children.
    <br>Today they are together with me and I will be going home with them, staying as a family.
    <br>Wow, we thank God for what He has done in your life.
    <br>For the benefit of those watching you - you mentioned that after your deliverance the man of God met you
    <br>and told you that there was a daughter that you need to take care of and pay the necessary responsibilities too.
    <br>The man of God made me to understand that there was an abandoned daughter that I need to take care of
    <br>and take up the responsibility, so that my future would be brighter.
    <br>He invited the mother to bring the daughter to me.
    <br>He sought the face of God and resolved the issue.
    <br>These are the children that God restored back to me.
    <br>The very girl you are talking about - can you point her out and tell us her name?
    <br>Yeah, this is the daughter the man of God has spoken about - Victory by name.
    <br>By the grace of God, she was brought to me to be my legitimate daughter.
    <br>Can you explain to us where was your daughter all this time.
    <br>Yes, my daughter has been with her mother since birth.
    <br>I was informed that she was pregnant.
    <br>I denied it and said then that I did not know anything about the pregnancy - this led to a big problem.
    <br>But by the almighty hand of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua was able to put light into this matter.
    <br>He made me to understand that the girl was my biological daughter.
    <br>By the grace of God I was able to see all the indices - everything indicates that she is my daughter.
    <br>It was the problem I had in the past that made me to deny her.
    <br>OK, glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God for all the wonderful things He has done in your life.
    <br>Now that you are here with your two daughters,
    <br>could you tell us their names and what your plan is for your daughters.
    <br>Yes, my daughters that are here: this is Victory Adisa and this is Precious Adisa.
    <br>By the grace of God, now I prepare myself to take them home to take up my responsibilities, to sponsor them,
    <br>to send them to better schools, and take up all necessary obligations.
    <br>What are you going to do now, upon receiving this wonderful message of prophecy and directions
    <br>you received from the man of God?
    <br>Could you tell us what is your plan for yourself now?
    <br>Yes. The man of God has told me in the prophecy that God created me to be great in life.
    <br>He paid a homage to me.
    <br>He said I was born to be a ruler. Therefore, I'm not to be suffering.
    <br>Now, I prepare myself to take care of my business, to put all my intellect into it so that the future can be brighter.
    <br>Right now, by the grace of God, I will abandon anything concerning women,
    <br>and I will take care of my business, so that the future can be better.
    <br>We thank God for this wonderful revelation, that God Almighty has used Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to bring about in your life.
    <br>We believe sincerely as you will take this instruction in righteousness and faith,
    <br>that the best is yet to come in your life, in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We also want to listen to the next person.
    <br>Mr Samuel Adisa & Family
    <br>Family Reconciled After Prophecy
    <br>Madam, we welcome you today to The SCOAN, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you introduce yourself to us?
    <br>My name is Mary Adolor.
    <br>Could you introduce to us the people standing next to you and tell us what God Almighty has done in you life.
    <br>This one here is my daughter Victory Samuel Adisa
    <br>and this is Precious Samuel Adisa - they are my children.
    <br>This is the situation God rescued me from:
    <br>I was pregnant with this girl for a month and 2 weeks, when I had a misunderstanding with my husband,
    <br>and he sent me away from his house.
    <br>I packed my things and came back to my parents' house.
    <br>Along the line...
    <br>When I got to the village, I found out that I was pregnant.
    <br>I called him and told him that I left his house being pregnant for a month and 2 weeks.
    <br>He told me that he was not responsible for that and that I should go and look for the responsible person.
    <br>I told him that I was sure that I had left his house being pregnant.
    <br>We argued about it and he denied the child.
    <br>I had nothing else to say than calling my God day and night.
    <br>I stayed with my mother in the village doing nothing.
    <br>After nine months of pregnancy I gave birth to Victory.
    <br>When I gave birth to Victory, I called the mum of my husband.
    <br>She said that she was happy.
    <br>She asked me why I hadn't informed her earlier.
    <br>I answered that there was a problem - I called her son and he denied responsibility for the pregnancy.
    <br>She said, "OK" - she was somehow happy.
    <br>Later, I received a call from her - she said that her son indeed denied the responsibility for the pregnancy.
    <br>I asked, "Is it what he told you?"
    <br>She said, "Yes".
    <br>I said, "OK, no problem - if he says so, but a time will come when he will come to look for her".
    <br>That is what I said to myself.
    <br>I said, "The time will come that he will come and look for her because I know he is the father".
    <br>She said, "OK".
    <br>When I called him again, he did not respond.
    <br>While I was in the village, there was no money because I wasn't doing anything - I was just trying to survive,
    <br>and to take care of this girl.
    <br>Because of the financial situation I would still call him to support me, to send money to me.
    <br>He wouldn't care and say that he would not come - so I gave up and forgot about it.
    <br>In January, the following year, my younger brother came to the village and met me.
    <br>He asked what I was doing in the village.
    <br>He was working in Lagos, and he just came to the village.
    <br>He saw the situation I was in and he said he was not happy about it.
    <br>He asked if I would come to Akwa Ibom.
    <br>I said, "Why not", because I was not used to live in the village - it was the first time I came back there.
    <br>He said I should come to Akwa Ibom with him.
    <br>He said that after he arrives in Akwa Ibom, he will look for an accommodation for me.
    <br>I said, "OK, no problem".
    <br>Having arrived there, he found an accommodation and he sent money to my account.
    <br>He said I should come to Akwa Ibom.
    <br>I said, "OK".
    <br>When I arrived there, he paid the 2-years rent for my room.
    <br>He started buying things and food, he started helping me.
    <br>That is how I started anew.
    <br>When my daughter was 1 year and 6 months old, my brother noticed that she was "sharp" and could talk.
    <br>He asked, "Why don't we look for a school for her?"
    <br>I said, "OK, but I don't have anything doing and I don't want to be a burden to you".
    <br>He said that I should send her to school.
    <br>There was one nearby school on my street - I went there and got admission for her.
    <br>She started to go to that school when she was 1 year and 6 months old.
    <br>I knew that staying home, doing nothing would not help me.
    <br>My brother wouldn't be there for me everyday.
    <br>He asked why I couldn't look for something to do.
    <br>I said, "Good. If you can also help with that, I will appreciate it".
    <br>He looked for a shop and gave me some money to start some business with it,
    <br>so I would be able to take care of the girl.
    <br>That is what he did for me.
    <br>My younger brother - I appreciate his help.
    <br>I thank God for what he did for me.
    <br>When I started the business, everything was going fine.
    <br>With the little money he gave me to start up, my business was going fine.
    <br>It was two years ago...
    <br>In 2014, I don't know what happened - my business collapsed.
    <br>That was 2014 - my business collapsed.
    <br>In fact, everything about me.
    <br>I was not able to pay her school fees anymore.
    <br>I started asking God, "God, what did I do wrong, so all this is happening to me?"
    <br>In the same year I lost my dad.
    <br>After the burial, in 2015 I tried to manage my life again.
    <br>I didn't know that this was God's will for me
    <br>because while I had money, I did not remember to call on God.
    <br>I put the loan I had taken into the business.
    <br>I could not earn money - everything went again like that.
    <br>That is when I started seeking the face of God.
    <br>I received a call from The SCOAN.
    <br>The woman told me that the man of God wanted to see me and that I should come to Lagos.
    <br>I said that I was not the one she was looking for.
    <br>She asked, "Is this Mary?"
    <br>At the beginning I said, "No", because I thought it was somebody I owed money.
    <br>I said I was not Mary to the person who called me.
    <br>She said, "No, I know that I am speaking to Mary".
    <br>I said, "No. I am not the one. It is my sister, who sometimes uses this number".
    <br>She said, "OK. How can I get her?"
    <br>I said, "OK, I will pass the message to her so you can talk to her."
    <br>She said, "Please, I need to talk to her".
    <br>I said, "OK".
    <br>After 15 minutes I got another call.
    <br>I was asked to call back.
    <br>I said, "Hello".
    <br>She said, "Hello."
    <br>I introduced myself as Mary - may God forgive me because of my previous lie.
    <br>I said, "This is Mary speaking".
    <br>She said, "OK. I couldn't reach you earlier on".
    <br>I said that my sister just came and gave me the information.
    <br>She asked me to come down to The SCOAN.
    <br>I said, "No. I am not the one. I heard about The SCOAN, but I have never been there.
    <br>I don't even dream of coming there".
    <br>She said I should come.
    <br>I said, "Please, check the number - I'm not the one. It is a wrong number".
    <br>She called me back, "Are you not Mary Adolor?"
    <br>I said, "This is me".
    <br>She said I was the one they wanted to see.
    <br>She didn't let me know that my husband was here.
    <br>I called my sister.
    <br>I told her that I received a call and they said I should come to The SCOAN.
    <br>She said, "No. Are you sure?"
    <br>I said, "Maybe someone wants to set me up, because I know what type of man my husband is".
    <br>I said I was not going.
    <br>I thought that maybe it was somebody else calling from Lagos.
    <br>She said that I should text the number to her.
    <br>I text the number to my sister.
    <br>When she called the number, she confirmed it to be from The SCOAN.
    <br>I then decided to come on Sunday or Monday.
    <br>I called The SCOAN - she told me that they wanted to see me on Saturday.
    <br>I said, "OK. I need to take a night bus on Friday night".
    <br>I arrived in Lagos on Saturday morning.
    <br>That is how I found myself in this place.
    <br>When I came to the church on Sunday, they called Samuel out and asked him questions about his daughter.
    <br>They asked him for how long he hadn't seen his daughter.
    <br>He said, "For the past nine years".
    <br>They asked him, "Where do you think the woman is now?"
    <br>He said that she was far away.
    <br>The man of God asked him then, "What if you see your wife now?"
    <br>He was shocked.
    <br>He couldn't believe that I was around.
    <br>Then, they said I should come out.
    <br>Then, he saw me and his daughter.
    <br>When he saw me, he was surprised to see me in the church.
    <br>When he saw the daughter, they then asked him questions.
    <br>They brought my first daughter - Precious - they asked her a question,
    <br>"Who is this woman to you? Is she you mother?"
    <br>She said, "No." That I was not her mother.
    <br>They asked her, "Who is she to you?"
    <br>She said she didn't know me.
    <br>The man of God said, "OK".
    <br>He asked my husband who my second daughter was to him.
    <br>He said he didn't know her, that Victory wasn't his daughter and he didn't know anything about her.
    <br>That is how it all happened on that Sunday.
    <br>We understand that after that, the man of God took his time to give words of counselling
    <br>and gave God's point of view concerning these children.
    <br>We understand the man of God prayed for you for your deliverance.
    <br>He prayed for us for our deliverance.
    <br>After the deliverance and the prayer - I thank God because I see changes.
    <br>When I came the first time, my husband didn't even want to see or call me.
    <br>He was seriously angry with me, seeing me in the church.
    <br>After the prayer and deliverance - the following morning I received a call from him.
    <br>He asked about me and my daughter and how we were doing.
    <br>I said we were fine.
    <br>He asked about our hotel and if we wanted to change it.
    <br>I said that we were comfortable.
    <br>I thank God so much because we, especially our daughters, met.
    <br>They didn't know each other.
    <br>Victory didn't know Precious, and Precious didn't know Victory.
    <br>Precious didn't even know me as her mother.
    <br>But now, we are all united together as a family.
    <br>I thank God so much, because He used Prophet T.B. Joshua to bring back this family again.
    <br>We thank God for what He has done in your life.
    <br>We really want to encourage you that as you continue staying obedient to the instruction of righteousness,
    <br>that the man of God has given, that the best is yet to come in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We also want to listen to our mothers.
    <br>I am Philomena Adolor.
    <br>I am coming from Edo State.
    <br>I thank God today for the life of my daughter.
    <br>I'm the mother of Mary.
    <br>I thank God - my coming to the SCOAN is a blessing to me, because the man of God has made me know that...
    <br>I thank God for answering me.
    <br>My granddaughter that was abandoned by her father - he came back to claim his daughter.
    <br>For that I give glory to God.
    <br>I knew that one day God would arrest him.
    <br>We were talking about this matter for a long time.
    <br>Today, we thank God for it.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has settled the issue and made us to be one again as a family.
    <br>We thank God today.
    <br>Now, Victory knows her mother and Precious knows her father.
    <br>For that we thank God - we give glory to God.
    <br>We also thank the man of God.
    <br>We understand that it was the man of God who invited you to come down from your State
    <br>to attend the Sunday Service, for you to witness what God Almighty has done for your grandchildren
    <br>and for your daughter.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua we are here presenting you with the cash sum of N100 000
    <br>for your transport and for your welfare.
    <br>This is on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners, and we bless God for that.
    <br>I thank the man of God. God will give him more grace.
    <br>I thank God today for what He has done for me. It was not easy. Thank you.
    <br>My name is Adisa Mary.
    <br>My son is Adisa Samuel.
    <br>I give all glory to the Lord Almighty for all He has done in my life and my son's life.
    <br>I thank God for all. What was spoilt before, the God of T.B. Joshua has turned it to good.
    <br>I thank God for everything.
    <br>He has done good to me, He has brought everything to good.
    <br>I thank God for that.
    <br>We thank God.
    <br>We understand that it was Prophet T.B Joshua that invited you to come down from your State

    <br>Amen.
    <br>Now, on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>we are here to present to you this cash gift of N200 000.
    <br>This is for your welfare, upkeep, and transport.
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>I thank God and Prophet T.B. Joshua for providing this money for me, my transport and welfare.
    <br>I thank God so much and I pray that Almighty God should continue making this ministry to grow,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>We thank God for this wonderful thing God Almighty used T.B. Joshua to do
    <br>in your life and your children's lives, bringing them back together for the very first time.
    <br>They are going to grow up together now and have a wonderful life together.
    <br>Could you just once again, for the benefit of those watching us, tell us what you plan to do now,
    <br>concerning your own future and the future of your children?
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>I really thank God today, for what He used Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in my life.
    <br>He has used him to reconcile my family and bring my children together.
    <br>I am here together with my children now.
    <br>From now on, I will take up the responsibility of taking care of my two daughters -
    <br>to give them the best education so that they can have a good life.
    <br>By the grace of God, by the instruction of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>I'm taking them to my house now.
    <br>They will be staying with me.
    <br>By the grace of God, we will be able to understand ourselves better.
    <br>By the grace of God, after receiving directions and the prophecy from the man of God,
    <br>I will now go out into the world to prepare myself for a bigger business.
    <br>God had really been doing this in the past.
    <br>God had been blessing me in the past, until this problem happened.
    <br>By the grace of God, the man of God said that if I go and focus on my career, God is going to bless me
    <br>and I will come back with a big testimony.
    <br>I will face my future henceforth, by the grace of God.
    <br>I will not allow womanising, spirit of lust, and other unnecessary things to distract my focus.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God for all He has done in your life.
    <br>Now, we are here...
    <br>Since you have given that promise that you are going to take care, and do your responsibility as a father,
    <br>the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent us to present this gift to you.
    <br>This is a cash gift of N320 000, given by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>I give all the glory to God Almighty for using Prophet T.B. Joshua to intervene in my case.
    <br>I really bless God that the man of God intervened in my issue.
    <br>I believe I am the one supposed to pay him for the service rendered to me.
    <br>God has really used him to bless me again with the sum of N320 000 to take care of my children.
    <br>I believe my future will now be better and brighter, by the grace of God.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God for this beautiful thing that God Almighty has done in this family.
    <br>We want to wish all of you the very best.
    <br>We believe that God Almighty will continue to dwell with you, as you will continue to
    <br>follow the instructions in righteousness given by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We believe, as your lives continue to be centred on the Word of God and on Christ - better is not good enough
    <br>but the best is yet to come in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We also want to encourage you - make sure you stay close to Jesus Christ, and raise your children
    <br>in the way of the Lord so when they grow up, they will not depart from it, in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
