  <p>    
    <br>How are you, brother?
    <br>Are you the one that betrayed this woman or she betrayed you?
    <br>I am the one.
    <br>Thank you. I am happy. This is a Christian.
    <br>How did you betray her?
    <br>That was in the first country I was staying in when I travelled out of Nigeria.
    <br>I had a baby girl with that lady.
    <br>You know at the beginning, that baby girl, you were trying to deny it.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>Even your voice is still not clear concerning that child.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The child is living with her?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What happened was that, when I was in that first country,
    <br>I left the country and went to another place.
    <br>When I got there, I met another person.
    <br>That was the reason I couldn't marry her.
    <br>Where is the child now? Where is the woman?
    <br>She is in Libreville, Gabon.
    <br>When did you hear from the child and the mother last?
    <br>I heard from them two months ago.
    <br>Two months ago?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What did she tell you because there was something she kept telling you?
    <br>That is the more reason that I called you.
    <br>She told me that she wanted to establish a business,
    <br>that I should establish a business for her,
    <br>So she said that she needs your help.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She said that she needs your help. Give her money and call her to pray for you.
    <br>She is a faithful lady.
    <br>At the time you met her, after you came into her life, you disfocused her.
    <br>She doesn't know what to do again.
    <br>She doesn't even have a settled home.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>If it was possible, she would want to marry you back because she cannot marry anybody.
    <br>She told me that I am 'the man of her life'.
    <br>You love her. It is the condition that actually changed you over there.
    <br>You were looking for a way of having a breakthrough.
    <br>Indeed, your heart is for this woman but you cannot go for two again.
    <br>You have to settle with this one and forget that one.
    <br>At this point now you cannot marry her but you should make her happy.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Without deliverance, she cannot forget you.
    <br>Without deliverance, she will not marry forever.
    <br>She doesnt have any affection for anybody.
    <br>After the money that you are going to give her,
    <br>give her and her daughter money for her ticket for prayer.
    <br>After the prayer, she can now have affection to get married to somebody.
    <br>She will remain the mother of your child.
    <br>You can be helping her in the future but she will leave you and you will leave her.
    <br>So that is it. Thank you.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Following the prophecy of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and supported by him,
    <br>the man sent for his daughter and her mother whom he had denied.
    <br>They met once again for the first time in 12 long years at The SCOAN.
    <br>Let's watch the encounter.
    <br>Can you see the power of prophecy?
    <br>This beautiful girl would have lost finally, just like that, if not for the prophecy.
    <br>It was that prophecy that made him agree that he is the father.
    <br>My name is Elijah Chikwendu.
    <br>I am a Nigerian living in DRC.
    <br>What happened was that I was having a lot of challenges in my life.
    <br>I was looking for a way out of the problems.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN last year.
    <br>The man of God prophesied to me that there was a lady I had disappointed.
    <br>I accepted because I knew that the man of God did not know me.
    <br>He prophesied exactly what had happened in my past life.
    <br>He told me to go and bring the girl to Nigeria for deliverance
    <br>so that she could be free and make a new life
    <br>because as you can see right now, I am married with four kids.
    <br>My daughter here - I have not seen her for the past 12 years now.
    <br>As you are seeing her here, this is also my first time of seeing her.
    <br>Man of God, please, I need your help.
    <br>These are the things blocking many of you.
    <br>He said he is seeing her for the first time.
    <br>But you are looking for breakthrough, blessing.
    <br>Witches and wizards are the cause.
    <br>But we don't know the one that we have caused by ourselves.
    <br>99% of our challenges are caused by ourselves.
    <br>So now, when this is settled, you have to take care of the child, pay school fees,
    <br>whatever this woman might have paid for the past 12 years.
    <br>You have to sit down and discuss - reconciliation, give them money
    <br>and take responsibility of your daughter as a father.
    <br>And whatever you need to give to the woman, give it to her and continue as a father.
    <br>And the future is bright.
    <br>The hindrance is removed.
    <br>Many of you don't know that this is the cause of your problems.
    <br>That is why, no matter the prayer you offer, your prayer cannot be answered.
    <br>Because something is there that needs to be removed - mountain.
    <br>No matter the fasting - if you fast for 40 days and 40 nights;
    <br>and pray and go to the mountain, nothing will happen.
    <br>Unless you meet a man of God that will tell you, "This is the mountain that you need to move".
    <br>If you move this mountain and say "Jesus!", Jesus will hear you.
    <br>But if you don't move that mountain and you keep shouting "Jesus!" -
    <br>something is blocking you - between you and Jesus.
    <br>Sometimes you say, "You pray, you fast".
    <br>Many of you say, "I am a Christian now".
    <br>Now you start being faithful, kind.
    <br>If you were a drunkard, you stop drinking.
    <br>If you were a liar, you stop lying.
    <br>If you were a thief, you stop stealing.
    <br>You start living a good life
    <br>People start to say,  "He is a Christian now".
    <br>But yet, the life has not changed.
    <br>People say, "But this man has stopped going to the night club, he is now going to church.
    <br>He is even an elder in the church, he fasts, he is an usher,
    <br>he is an elder, he is everything, he is always at home, he is preaching the gospel,
    <br>but his life has not changed. Why?"
    <br>There is a hindrance.
    <br>All that kindness, goodness - God is not hearing it.
    <br>Until that hindrance is removed.
    <br>Mountain
    <br>You gonna move, oh mountain
    <br>You gonna move
    <br>I say right now in the name of Jesus
    <br>Mountain
    <br>You gonna move
    <br>It is a lesson. It is not what happened to this man that matters now
    <br>but the lesson you will learn today from this matter.
    <br>The lesson you will learn today is more important than what the man is saying.
    <br>Man of God, the prophecy you gave to me is actually true.
    <br>What happened is that after the prophecy,
    <br>there were some certain things I remembered which I did
    <br>and before the prophecy, all these things had not yet come to my senses.
    <br>After the prophecy, I remembered that when she gave birth to my baby,
    <br>there was something that I went to their family house to do.
    <br>It was a kind of presentation for the family, without knowing
    <br>that it would have an impact on her or on myself in the future.
    <br>It was after the prophecy that I realised that in their place,
    <br>it means that she would be waiting for me.
    <br>Now, as it is, I am married; she is not married yet.
    <br>Man of God, please, now that I am married,
    <br>I want you to help me to break the covenant
    <br>so that this woman will be set free and remarry.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>This woman needs to be set free.
    <br>This woman needs to be delivered so that she can remove her mind from this man.
    <br>Because for the past 15 years, she still believed that this man was her husband.
    <br>Therefore, no one is like this man to her.
    <br>No one!
    <br>If she just sees anyone - a handsome man -
    <br>she just says, "He is not as fat as this man".
    <br>If she sees another one - "He is not as short as this man."
    <br>If she sees another one - "He doesn't know how to kiss like this man."
    <br>There is trouble!
    <br>That covenant needs to be broken so that the woman can be free.
    <br>Okay, this is your little girl?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So we are going to talk, what this woman has spent on this girl.
    <br>How much? - I am going to sit at the meeting
    <br>and you are going to take care of this daughter.
    <br>You are also going to establish this woman -
    <br>whatever you can give her to start her life after the deliverance so that they can go.
    <br>The restitution of this little girl will be your responsibility.
    <br>Whatever she might have spent in the past from when this girl was a baby, we have to return it.
    <br>That is restitution, not just deliverance.
    <br>It will go with restitution.
    <br>We take care of this girl, and the lady will go and visit you and take you as her father.
    <br>And you too will go to her house to greet.
    <br>You should let your wife at home know. I want to see her too.
    <br>To let her know that this lady is part of the family.
    <br>It is not something you do secretly.
    <br>Because if you do this secretly, it will not look polite.
    <br>You have to let her know; and I will let her know.
    <br>It is not going to disturb your marriage but know, she is part of the family.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Man of God, please, help me to beg them to forgive me - even my daughter.
    <br>Since Saturday, she couldn't come near me; she was always crying.
    <br>Because she doesn't know you.
    <br>She had your picture when she was very small.
    <br>Imagine how you were looking 12 years ago and how you are looking now.
    <br>After the service we will settle everything; everything will be fine.
    <br>How are you? Where are you from?
    <br>We are from Gabon.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>You are welcome!
    <br>Explain my own side, please.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Let the mother and the daughter know that God is in control.
    <br>After the service, I want to meet them.
    <br>She will receive complete deliverance so she can see her real value
    <br>and how to move forward.
    <br>I want her to forgive this gentleman here because God has forgiven the gentleman.
    <br>So, she has to forgive the gentleman and he will do the right thing.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Let me talk to the little girl.
    <br>Why was she running from her father?
    <br>He abandoned me.
    <br>Don't ask her another question, please.
    <br>Come!
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Don't worry, okay? I am going to see her immediately after the service.
    <br>And she will be very happy because God is involved.
    <br>God is involved!
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>She has no word to qualify that.
    <br>A very sharp word: He has abandoned me!
    <br>Not trying to explain herself - He has abandoned me!
    <br>In a hasty way. Can you see the bitterness!
    <br>So don't worry. I want to see you.
    <br>How old is she now?
    <br>I am 14 years old.
    <br>It means, she was two years old.
    <br>There is no way she could recognise this man.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>She is my guest, I invited them.
    <br>I want to thank them for obeying this message, for coming down to Nigeria.
    <br>So thank you very much! Please, help me thank them!
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Ask your neigbour, "What lesson have you learnt from this?"
    <br>Great!
    <br>It means, something can block one.
    <br>No matter how faithful you are.
    <br>No matter how kind you are.
    <br>No matter how nice, humble and obedient to God.
    <br>If something stands against you, that your obedience is self-obedience.
    <br>Self-faithfulness.
    <br>Until that thing is moved.
    <br>You need revelation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I need revelation".
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
