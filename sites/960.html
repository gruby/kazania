    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Children of God, Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ikeaguzi Rita.
    <br>The people standing beside me are my mother and my elder brothers.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>When I was staying in a village in 2012, a lady came to me.
    <br>She asked me if I wanted to travel out of the country.
    <br>I agreed and was very excited because I wanted to travel
    <br>and I thought that travelling was like Heaven.
    <br>I never knew that the journey I would take was very risky.
    <br>Then, the lady said she had called a man who would come to my house to speak to my family.
    <br>That was how the man came to our house and spoke to my parents and me.
    <br>The man said that I would travel to Europe; then, he asked me if I could hustle.
    <br>I asked the man which kind of hustle he meant.
    <br>The man said, "Anything to do with fashion like women's hair or jewelry".
    <br>Then I agreed that I could do it and got ready to travel.
    <br>The following day, the man said that I should meet him in Benin;
    <br>so, I went to Benin to meet the man.
    <br>When I arrived in Benin, I was with five other girls in a hotel room.
    <br>I asked the other girls but none of them knew what they were going to do in Europe;
    <br>all the man said was that they would hustle.
    <br>Then, we started the journey.
    <br>When we travelled, we passed some countries but I do not know the names.
    <br>Then, we passed through the desert to get to Libya.
    <br>When we passed through the desert, it was not easy; we were between life and death.
    <br>When we passed through the desert, we spent four days in a jeep.
    <br>The jeep was supposed to carry 10 people but they packed us in like sardines, so, we were 90.
    <br>You mean 90 people - nine zero (90)?
    <br>Yes, we were 90 people in a jeep.
    <br>You're 90 people in a vehicle that is meant for just 10.
    <br>Yes
    <br>Both males and females, we sat one in front of the other; they squeezed us in like ants.
    <br>Then, we passed through the desert; after passing through the desert, we arrived in Libya.
    <br>When we arrived in Libya, the man told us that it was the European country we were travelling to.
    <br>I did not know then that Libya was an African country.
    <br>The man separated us and took me to a lady; they hustled at her place.
    <br>I stayed with the lady with some of the girls and some of the girls stayed with the man.
    <br>One day, the man said that we should go and hustle.
    <br>I told the man that I would not hustle because he didn't tell me that to hustle means
    <br>doing prostitution in Europe.
    <br>The man said that I should start prostitution in Libya.
    <br>I told the man that he didn't tell me or my parents that it was for prostitution.
    <br>The man told me that I had to do prostitution.
    <br>Otherwise he would make trouble with my family in the village.
    <br>He even threatened to kill me saying that no one would ask of me; I would just die like that.
    <br>I felt I had no choice than to do the prostitution.
    <br>When I was at the lady's place - they call it 'Connection House' -
    <br>I would be in a room and men would be sent to me.
    <br>From five to eight men would come and sleep with me,
    <br>they would give me money and the man would take the money from me.
    <br>So, on a daily basis, you were meeting up to eight men,
    <br>you were kept in this room, and the men would come and meet you there, sleep with you.
    <br>Whatever money you collected from them would be given to this man,
    <br>who was acting as if he was your slave master.
    <br>Yes
    <br>One day, I ran away from the man.
    <br>When I ran away from the man....
    <br>Sister, before you ran away, for how long had you been there in Libya doing this?
    <br>I left Nigeria in 2012 and I came back in 2014; I was in Libya for almost two years.
    <br>I ran away from the man and got to another city in Libya, where I met a Cameroonian guy.
    <br>From there, we went to Cameroon and from Cameroon, we went to Chad.
    <br>Okay, so you started a relationship with this man from Cameroon
    <br>and he took you from Libya back to his country of Cameroon,
    <br>and then the two of you went to the nation of Chad.
    <br>What were you doing in Chad?
    <br>The man said we should go to Chad because of his art work, so, he brought me to Chad.
    <br>When we arrived in Chad, the man said that he was a painter but he did not get any work in Chad.
    <br>I don't even know if he could paint or not because I never saw his work.
    <br>The only thing the man used to do was to sleep around with different women,
    <br>sometimes, he would beat and curse me.
    <br>One day, I told the man that I didn't need this kind of relationship.
    <br>I was lucky, one fateful day, I met a Nigerian lady;
    <br>when I explained my story, she helped me get a job in Chad.
    <br>When I was working, the lady helped me look for another job in a beer parlour.
    <br>I started working in a beer parlour; when I was working there, I met a Nigerian man.
    <br>The Nigerian man told me that he had a sister in Europe and asked if I wanted to go there.
    <br>That is how I was deceived again.
    <br>I told him that the travelling I attempted before was very risky.
    <br>He told me that this journey was to Europe, not Libya and I agreed.
    <br>I spoke to a lady on the phone, who said I would give her 36,000 euros.
    <br>But then, I didn't know the value of 36,000 euros; I thought it was like 36,000 naira!
    <br>They continued talking to me, deceiving me that before five months,
    <br>I would have paid off the money and started to help my family - to relieve their suffering.
    <br>I agreed so, they took me to a native doctor.
    <br>They said the native doctor would prepare my body so that when I got to Europe,
    <br>I would see a man to help me and give me money.
    <br>My family never went to native doctors; it was then, I was introduced to native doctors.
    <br>The native doctor prepared my body by giving me a fowl.
    <br>and said that I should spin the fowl around my head several times and repeat what he said.
    <br>The native doctor said I should be naked and he brought a knife and other things.
    <br>The native doctors said that if I did not give the lady the money, I would die
    <br>and if I handed the lady over to the police, I would die.
    <br>He also said that if I sent money from the lady back to Nigeria, I would also die.
    <br>I said, "Okay, no problem".
    <br>Then, the native doctor took my finger nails, toe nails, pubic hair and underwear.
    <br>He kept those things and they are still with him now.
    <br>After I finished everything at the herbalist's, I travelled.
    <br>When I travelled, the lady's brother handed me over to another person.
    <br>I followed the person to travel; I was told that I would not travel by road but by air.
    <br>As we were going, we passed Lagos, Nigeria; I thought I would get my passport there.
    <br>When I asked the man, he said that it was not his business that I was just handed over to him;
    <br>he said he did not know what I was talking about, then we left.
    <br>We passed some countries, just like the first journey and we entered the desert again.
    <br>When we got to the desert -  the first time  travelled was better than the second time.
    <br>The second journey was very hard; I saw a lot of things on the way.
    <br>Some of them would demand for money because they would act like police to you.
    <br>But if you don't have any money to pay them, they will beat you and they can even kill you.
    <br>Many people died in the desert; many people even died in the jeep.
    <br>They surround the jeep with sticks to hold on; if you don't hold on well to the stick, you will fall and die.
    <br>Then, we got to Libya.
    <br>It is from Tripoli they 'push people' to Italy.
    <br>I spent one month and two weeks in Tripoli, before we crossed to Italy in a boat.
    <br>We just want you to explain how you were pushed into the ocean to go across to Italy.
    <br>Can you just describe the kind of boats that you entered,
    <br>and what it looked like and how many of you were inside?
    <br>The 'lapa-lapa' is a rubber boat.
    <br>We were 90 in the boat but normally that boat is supposed to carry 12 or 13 people.
    <br>Okay, so you're saying it is like a rubber boat.
    <br>Just a small rubber boat that is supposed to just contain 12 to 13 people,
    <br>but more than 90 people were on top of this boat.
    <br>Yes, and that was how we entered the sea.
    <br>Okay, and none of you in that boat could swim.
    <br>None of us could swim.
    <br>When we set out on the sea, it was 10pm; we arrived in Italian waters at 8am.
    <br>We slept in the boat on the sea before the Italian rescuers rescued us.
    <br>When the Italian rescuers rescued us, we were put into a camp.
    <br>I called the lady that I had arrived in Italy, she said that she would come and pick me up.
    <br>She picked me up and I stayed in her house.
    <br>The following day, she said that I should get ready to work.
    <br>When I asked her which work, she said, "Prostitution".
    <br>Then she told me that the 36,000 euros I was to pay her was equal to 7 million naira.
    <br>7 million naira?
    <br>Even more than 7 million naira is equal to 36,000 euro.
    <br>I told the lady that I could not pay the money, because it was too much.
    <br>I told her that she did not tell me it was seven million naira, I thought it was 30,000 naira.
    <br>The lady said that I must pay the money and if I reported her to the police,
    <br>I should remember the ritual I did in Nigeria - I would die.
    <br>So, I felt that I had no choice. The lady was also doing prostitution.
    <br>The lady took me to where they did the prostitution, which was on the road.
    <br>When a car came along, the lady would settle the price because the lady speaks their language.
    <br>After the lady would speak for me, she would tell me to enter the car;
    <br>I would enter the car and follow the man.
    <br>The lowest price would be from 10 to 20 euros, but if somebody wanted to take you to a hotel,
    <br>it would cost 50-100 euros. The lowest price was 10-20 euros.
    <br>I would sleep with different men, up to 10, 5 or 6.
    <br>One day, I could not bear it anymore; I told the lady that I wanted to go.
    <br>At this point, you had been in Italy prostituting for how many months,
    <br>when you told the lady you wanted to leave?
    <br>I stayed with the lady for eight months before I told her that I wanted to leave.
    <br>Then the lady said that I could not leave her and she started calling her people.
    <br>I told the lady that if she did not let me go, I would go to the police station and report her.
    <br>Even if I were to die, I was not afraid of death.
    <br>I wanted to go to the (police)station and tell them that I wanted to go back to my country.
    <br>Then, one day, I bought a second-hand phone with a SIM card already inside it.
    <br>I saw some numbers already stored in the phone so, I called one of them;
    <br>a man picked up the call, he was from Nigeria.
    <br>I told the man how I felt that I wanted to leave Italy because I was tired of my way of life.
    <br>The man said that if I felt that way and I didn't have anywhere to go, I could stay at his place.
    <br>I went to the man's place and stayed there.
    <br>This is someone you never knew before. You just saw a random phone number on a phone.
    <br>A second-hand phone that you bought in Italy, and you just called that man and agreed to go to him.
    <br>Yes, I bought a second-hand phone with a SIM card already inside of it.
    <br>I saw many numbers in the phone - I have never met the man before;
    <br>we just spoke on the phone, I had never seen him before; I didn't know him.
    <br>So that's how you ran away from that woman
    <br>who you were doing prostitution with, and you went to this guy.
    <br>Yes
    <br>Before I went to that man, he told me that he was working.
    <br>I did not know that he did not have a job; he was begging on the streets.
    <br>When I got to his place, I found out that he did not have a job and he was not doing anything.
    <br>I also didn't have anything to do; so, I joined him to beg because I didn't want to do prostitution.
    <br>It now led you to start begging on the streets.
    <br>Yes, we would go together to beg on the streets.
    <br>When we were together begging on the streets,
    <br>I told the guy that I was tired and wanted to go back to Nigeria.
    <br>He told me that I didn't know what I was saying and asked me how I could say that -
    <br>from Europe I wanted to return to Nigeria.
    <br>He said that people in Nigeria are suffering and looking for opportunity to travel -
    <br>for me to say I wanted to go back to Nigeria was not normal.
    <br>I told him that I was normal; I was tired of that way of life.
    <br>The guy told me that I should travel to Switzerland.
    <br>So, I travelled to Switzerland to seek for asylum.
    <br>When I travelled to Switzerland to seek for asylum,
    <br>I stayed there for three months in a camp.
    <br>They fed me and clothed me because I was staying there under care of the government.
    <br>Eventually, Switzerland rejected me because they said they had taken my fingerprints in Italy
    <br>so, they said I should go back to Italy.
    <br>In Switzerland, I met another man who I shared my experience with.
    <br>He told me that he had a sister in Belgium who would help me with documents to work.
    <br>Okay, so once again people of God,
    <br>we are listening to this life experience, so that everyone can pick one or two lessons.
    <br>Our sister never imagined in her wildest dreams that this was what she would encounter
    <br>when she was first told she would travel to Europe; she was expecting greener pastures;
    <br>she was expecting a beautiful life, a good job, but what she met was completely opposite.
    <br>To the point where she was begging on the streets, prostituting her body to make a living.
    <br>She said at this point she was unable to be given asylum in the nation of Switzerland
    <br>because of complications regarding her entry into Italy
    <br>and she was advised to go to the nation of Belgium.
    <br>So tell us sister, what happened when you reached Belgium?
    <br>When I got to Belgium, I was told that I could use someone else's documents to work.
    <br>When I got to Belgium, the lady said that she could not give me documents to work
    <br>because she was using the documents to take money.
    <br>I had nothing to do so, I went back to prostitution again.
    <br>I did not have anyone to feed me or pay house rent for me.
    <br>After doing prostitution for four months, I decided not to do it again - I was tired.
    <br>I went to the Belgium government to seek for asylum.
    <br>When I went to seek for asylum in Belgium, I told them that I wanted to go back to Nigeria.
    <br>When I told them that I wanted to go back to Nigeria, they asked me why.
    <br>I explained to them and they said that since I wanted to go back to Nigerian, they would help me.
    <br>That was how I returned to Nigeria and went home.
    <br>Okay, and when did you return to Nigeria?
    <br>I returned to Nigeria on the 9th of this month.
    <br>When I watched Emmanuel TV, my faith started to grow. Then, I decided to come back to Nigeria.
    <br>When I came back to Nigeria, I came to The SCOAN straight away.
    <br>We thank God that our sister is alive to actually tell this story, because we know
    <br>many embarked on a similar journey, and they are no longer alive to tell the story
    <br>Sister, what happened to you last week at The SCOAN when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you?
    <br>When the man of God was praying for people, I had not yet got close to him.
    <br>My whole body started shaking.
    <br>I didn't know what I was doing.
    <br>That is all I can remember.
    <br>And that was how you were delivered from that evil spirit that pushed you into prostitution?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And to the glory of God, ever since that deliverance last week,
    <br>what are the changes you've seen in your life?
    <br>There have been a lot of changes -
    <br>I don't have the urge to sleep with men anymore and I want to give my life to Christ.
    <br>I know God has delivered me and I am delivered forever, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And sister, we just want to understand  it. How old are you right now?
    <br>I am 25 years old.
    <br>Okay, so this journey started when our sister was just 20 years old.
    <br>She was aproached in the village by a man who promised to take her abroad to Europe for a better life
    <br>but opposite was the case.
    <br>We thank God that through it all, here she is today in the presence of God.
    <br>And sister, before we listen to your family members, what is your word of advice?
    <br>Especially to young people out there, a lot of young people have this impression
    <br>that they should travel abroad at all costs, that there'll be greener pastures, a better life there.
    <br>And they're not ready to go through the right process or procedure to travel.
    <br>As someone that has been on this hellish five-year journey,
    <br>what is your advice to them based on your own life experience?
    <br>I thank God for my life and I thank the man of God for delivering me from the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>My advice to viewers around the world, the youth and especially girls -
    <br>they may hear many things about Europe that it is like Heaven there;
    <br>I want to advise you that whatever you are doing - whether it is hair styling,
    <br>fashion design or sales work - just continue what you are doing.
    <br>One day, God will see you through.
    <br>I am not saying that people should not travel but if you do, travel in a mature way.
    <br>You should not listen to people who say, "I have a salon, supermarket, etc."
    <br>They are deceiving you.
    <br>If you are to travel, make sure you travel in a mature way; that is my advice to them.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>The confession you are giving right now, is your family hearing this for the first time?
    <br>The first time I travelled, my parents were aware of it.
    <br>Although, I did not know what I was going to do then.
    <br>The second time I travelled, my mother did not know about it;
    <br>at a point, I explained to my older brother what I was doing there.
    <br>My brother said that if that was what happened and the lady said I should pay her
    <br>seven million naira and I should get it through prostitution, it's better that I came home.
    <br>My name is Ngozi Ikeaguzi.
    <br>The thing your daughter just talked about now, what do you want to say about it?
    <br>Mothers and fathers, if you have girls and people approach you
    <br>to let your child travel abroad, do not agree because they are deceivers.
    <br>Ok, our mother is advising that if anyone approaches you as a parent,
    <br>offering to take your child abroad and you know it's not in the right way,
    <br>you should not be deceived by them because they're playing a tricky game.
    <br>So, mama, you mean that you never knew that your daughter was going to do prostitution abroad?
    <br>No, I did not know.
    <br>So, now that God has delivered your daughter, what do you want to say?
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>My name is Stanley Ikeaguzi. I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am very happy. I thank God that she came back alive and she promised to give her life to Christ.
    <br>Amen! Let't put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Ikeaguzi Rita. I'm from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>The people that stand beside me: These are my mother and my brother.
    <br>I was delivered from the spirit of prostitution
    <br>After my deliverance, I was set free. I no longer have the urge to sleep with men.
    <br>I am free forever!
    <br>I am going back to my state to start life anew, I will not go back to prostitution.
    <br>As much as you are delivered through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
    <br>the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, in line with Emmanuel TV partners all over the world said
    <br>that he would not allow you to go empty-handed.
    <br>He needs to give you something to start your life anew.
    <br>For that reason, Emmanuel TV partners alongside with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, said
    <br>that we should present to you the sum of 150,000 naira.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Thank you, Man of God. Thank you, Emmanuel TV partners. Thank you. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Ikeaguzi Rita & Family Receive Cash Gift Of 150,000 Naira
    <br>I'm free and I will never go back to my past life of prostitution. I will never go back again, in Jesus name.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God. Thank you.
    <br>This 150,000 naira that the man of God has blessed me with,
    <br>is enough for me to start whatever I am going to do.
    <br>I will never go back to my former life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Apart from the 150,000 naira, we also present to you the sum of 40,000 for your transportation.
