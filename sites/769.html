  <p>    
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Let's offer this prayer.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace not to be ignorant of your faith
    <br>under pressure of temptation, sickness and disease.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace.
    <br>Give me the grace, Lord, not to be ignorant of my faith
    <br>under the pressure or tension of temptation, sickness, disease, hardship and setback.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever you are facing under that temptation, ask God, Lord Jesus,
    <br>give me the grace not to be ignorant of my faith under the pressure of temptation of my situation.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>When the situation comes, we seem to forget that we are Christians.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The Simple SECRET To Defeat The DEVIL!!!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>You seem to forget, when you are facing a challenge, a situation, that you are what God says you are;
    <br>you can do what God says you can do.
    <br>You seem to forget that you have what God says you have.
    <br>When God is with you, all things are possible.
    <br>You seem to forget that when you are facing a situation.
    <br>You and God together.
    <br>You seem to forget that you and God can move mountains when you are facing difficulties.
    <br>You have to come together; you and who?
    <br>[God.]
    <br>You and God must come together, join hands together.
    <br>There is no mountain, and there shall be no mountain.
    <br>You and God - but you seem to forget this when you are facing what?
    <br>Difficulty.
    <br>You need to remember the more difficult and trying times you have been facing in the past.
    <br>The key to succeeding in life, if you are a child of God - any time there is a difficulty.
    <br>quickly remember the more trying and difficult times you faced in the past.
    <br>This will impart strength to face the present difficulty you are having.
    <br>Just take your time to remember.
    <br>This is what happened to David.
    <br>David walked majestically to the king and said,
    <br>'King, I am going to face this Goliath that has disturbed my brothers and country'.
    <br>The king looked at him: 'Who are you?'
    <br>He said, 'I used my bare hands to kill the bear'.
    <br>When this man came to disturb their country, he quickly remembered the difficult and trial times he overcame.
    <br>Having remembered the bear, he looked at Goliath and said, "Let me face this man".
    <br>In the same vein, that is the key for you to defeat your present situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is the key to defeat my present situation".
    <br>You can use the same key to open and lock.
    <br>Remember as David remembered, and he walked majestically to the king.
    <br>Take your time.
    <br>Any time you are facing a challenge or situation, remember the more difficult and trying times
    <br>you had in the past and you overcame.
    <br>That will impart strength to face your present situation.
    <br>I don’t know what I can face now that could be greater than the one I have faced in the past.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>In the same vein, I don’t know what you can face now
    <br>that can be greater than the one you have passed through in the past.
    <br>Once you remember this, that would impart strength to face your present situation.
    <br>You remember - half of us here came from village, if not 90% of people here.
    <br>You should remember those days when you were drinking dirty water.
    <br>But today you drink pure water, and yet - yellow fever.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now you drink pure water.
    <br>Where does the fever come from?
    <br>Tell me.
    <br>You, you are from the village.
    <br>Remember - in those days, when you cooked soup, it stayed for ten days and you kept warming it.
    <br>The more you warmed it, the more it became sweet.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you warm the soup today?
    <br>When you cook a soup today, can you warm it tomorrow and eat it?
    <br>[No]
    <br>But in the village...
    <br>These are the things that brought you up.
    <br>Remember how you were born.
    <br>Many of you were not born in the hospital.
    <br>The people you call your enemies now, they were the ones feeding you when you were a baby.
    <br>Your mummy alone could not have taken care of you - you would be left to move and roam around them,
    <br>but today you see them as somebody who can kill you.
    <br>This is a key I am giving you today.
    <br>Any time you are facing a difficult challenge, remember the more difficult and trying times you had in the past.
    <br>This will impart what?
    <br>[Strength]
    <br>To what?
    <br>To face what?
    <br>To face your present situation.
    <br>You need strength.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you talking of your career?
    <br>Remember the kind of school you attended in the village.
    <br>A school without a roof.
    <br>A school without what?
    <br>[Roof.]
    <br>You studied there under the rain, under the sun - but look today at what you have become.
    <br>If you don't know the kind of school you attended in the village in those days, go back to the village
    <br>and see where those children are studying now.
    <br>These are the things you put together.
    <br>When you think about all this, you will know that no one can stop you.
    <br>Say, "Only me can stop myself; no one can stop me".
    <br>No one can stop you; you can only stop yourself.
    <br>If you could not be stopped then, now, no one can stop you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need strength to further on.
    <br>This is how I nurture myself.
    <br>No matter what comes to me, now when I just remember and sit down and look at my antecedents -
    <br>where I'm coming from and what I have gone through.
    <br>Whatever happens now, I smile and say, "You are a baby".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I smile.
    <br>Once you don’t trade your joy with your situation, you overcome.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Stop trading your joy with your situation"
    <br>Once you stop trading your joy with your situation, you will always overcome
    <br>because you need joy to overcome a situation.
    <br>No matter how big the situation, if you don’t trade your joy with that situation, you overcome it.
    <br>But once joy is gone, you cannot overcome the situation.
    <br>This is what situation wants to take away from you.
    <br>It wants to take away your joy.
    <br>My God.
    <br>It wants to see you sad.
    <br>Situation wants to see you what?
    <br>[Sad.]
    <br>It wants to see you sad.
    <br>Once the situation comes, and you are sad...
    <br>How will I go over this?
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>This is too much for me.
    <br>Under that situation, you cannot pray.
    <br>Under that situation, you cannot think of God.
    <br>Under that situation...
    <br>Immediately you will lose a sense of reasoning, anybody around you is your enemy.
    <br>You will not be able to give your best.
    <br>I pick the phone call: - Hello
    <br>- Your house is on fire
    <br>- You mean my house?
    <br>- Yes. It is serious. Fire fighters are there.
    <br>Before that I was smiling.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People around me say, "What happened just now?"
    <br>I am coming.
    <br>I have traded my what?
    <br>[Joy.]
    <br>With what?
    <br>[Situation]
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: DON'T TRADE YOUR JOY
    <br>Look at you - you are happy now.
    <br>Satan knows what he can do to stop that happiness.
    <br>He knows.
    <br>Somebody wants to see you while you are dancing.
    <br>Where?
    <br>See me.
    <br>Where?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't make it very easy for satan.
    <br>Somebody is fighting you.
    <br>You relax instead of fighting back - you just make it cheap.
    <br>Somebody wants to see you while you are dancing.
    <br>Where?
    <br>OK. I'm coming.
    <br>You want to finish your dancing.
    <br>How many of you can do that?
    <br>Have you ever finished dancing before attending to somebody who wanted to see you?
    <br>No, I know you.
    <br>So please, stop trading your joy with your situation.
    <br>If you have a serious pain in your arm, you can choose not to trade that pain with your joy.
    <br>In serious pain.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Fine.
    <br>The pain is there.
    <br>Fine.
    <br>I have not been seeing you.
    <br>I was not around.
    <br>OK.
    <br>The pain is still inside me.
    <br>The pain does not want to hear joy.
    <br>Where there is pain and joy is there, the pain will not last.
    <br>Where there is sorrow and joy is there, the sorrow will not last at all.
    <br>They don't see each other.
    <br>It is like a cat and a rat.
    <br>If you choose to be happy while looking for a job, you will soon get it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you are sick, if you can choose to be happy in your heart - that sickness will not last long.
    <br>When your marriage is under threat, and somebody is trying to turn it upside down -
    <br>choose to be happy, and see what would happen next.
    <br>Do you know it is the situation that meets joy; it's not joy that meets situation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Situation meets joy; joy never meets situation".
    <br>If you study your life, it is situation that meets joy.
    <br>In one's life, situation comes to joy.
    <br>It is joy that owns you; situation never owns you.
    <br>Situation meets joy.
    <br>When the snake is coming to your house, you close the door.
    <br>You don't run away and open the door for the snake.
    <br>Stop trading your joy with what?
    <br>[Your situation.]
    <br>If you can do this, situation will come but it will not last and you will learn a mighty lesson that will help you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look at my antecedents from the beginning.
    <br>The name of this ministry was not supposed to be "Church Of All Nations".
    <br>When the church had only 8 members, the Lord said this is the "Church Of All Nations".
    <br>How many ministries do you know in your country that bear "Of All Nations"?
    <br>If it were not a ministry with a vision and mission...
    <br>The first church was destroyed, second was destroyed.
    <br>How many of you are still in the business you started with?
    <br>I don't think anybody here still remains in the business he began with, right from the beginning of his life.
    <br>After so many challenges...
    <br>If you don't know where you are going, you cannot continue.
    <br>You will not be able to wait for God's release if you don't know where you are going.
    <br>It is when you know where you are going, you will wait for God's release.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you know where you are going, you will wait for God's release;
    <br>you will wait patiently for God's release".
    <br>But when you don't know where you are going, you will release yourself.
    <br>You have been releasing yourself.
    <br>You release yourself in business, in marriage, in churches, everywhere you just...
    <br>This embarrassment...
    <br>How can you be lying against me?
    <br>You walk away.
    <br>You walk out of the community, business, church or marriage.
    <br>What kind of an insult is this?
    <br>This is an embarrassment, I can't believe what you are saying.
    <br>How can this pastor lie against me?
    <br>You walk out of the church.
    <br>In the marriage too - my husband is lying against me!
    <br>How can my wife do this to me?
    <br>You walk out of the marriage.
    <br>Business - oh my God.
    <br>I am supposed to be promoted.
    <br>Look at my junior - I trained this man.
    <br>Look at him - he has been promoted to the position above me.
    <br>You walk out of the business.
    <br>This is the life you have been living.
    <br>Situation has been releasing you.
    <br>Challenges have been releasing you.
    <br>You heard what Joseph said when he was in the pit.
    <br>He said, "I know where I belong".
    <br>You don't know where you are going.
    <br>He was in the pit where there was no water, no air.
    <br>There he said, "I know where I belong. This is not where I belong".
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you are laughing, satan is crying.
    <br>When you are crying, satan is laughing.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When you are laughing, satan is what?
    <br>[Crying.]
    <br>And when you are crying, satan is what?
    <br>[Laughing.]
    <br>Stop trading your joy with what?
    <br>[Situation.]
    <br>Situation.
    <br>No matter what happens, hold your joy.
    <br>It is by joy you can overcome your situation.
    <br>If you lose your joy, situation will overwhelm you.
    <br>Situation doesn't want to see joy.
    <br>When situation sees joy, it ceases.
    <br>When situation sees joy, it what?
    <br>[It ceases.]
    <br>Immediately.
    <br>It is stopped.
