    <br>We have one important guest in our midst.
    <br>Some time ago we met the God's general,
    <br>but there is another man who is my father in the Lord.
    <br>You know, for me to say someone is my father in the Lord...
    <br>Evan. Bill Subritzky's Testimony About T.B. Joshua
    <br>When the going was tough, he stood by me.
    <br>Evan. Bill Subritzky's Testimony About T.B. Joshua
    <br>In the past, he stood by me because his principle.
    <br>The Book of Romans 3:1-4 says, "Let God be true but every man a liar".
    <br>Indeed, everyone tells lies to his neighbour, whom can we believe?
    <br>But we can still believe true servant of God and God Almighty.
    <br>Here you meet a true servant of God, my father in the Lord.
    <br>Evan. Bill Subritzky's Testimony About T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>My name is Bill Subritzky and I'm from New Zealand, a small country 1200 miles from Australia,
    <br>a small country that have sent many preachers out.
    <br>The country is normally Christian, it is not fully Christian but many say they are Christians
    <br>and they need a lot of evangelizing.
    <br>This is my second wife, Kaylene.
    <br>After many years of very happy marriage with a beautiful Christian woman
    <br>who came to The SCOAN with me 11 years ago,
    <br>my wife, Pat who was a great admirer of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>passed onto glory two and a half years ago.
    <br>Before she went, she told friends, I didn't know this,
    <br>that if anything happened to her, I should marry again and I should marry this woman.
    <br>I knew nothing about it when I approached Kaylene and then I learned about it,
    <br>and also the Lord had spoken separately to Kaylene.
    <br>God is good, to give such a wonderful wife, a second wife,
    <br>chosen by my first wife without me knowing and I thank God for it.
    <br>So, this is Kaylene, my wife, a woman of God.
    <br>On March 10th 1971, as a practicing lawyer and business man,
    <br>a very successful one, I went to an evangelists meeting.
    <br>I didn't believe in healing but there I saw a person touched mightily by the power of God.
    <br>I gave my life to Christ in that meeting.
    <br>I was born again of the Spirit of God,
    <br>turned 180 degrees from darkness to light,
    <br>from the power of satan to the power of God
    <br>and God called me into evangelism, even though I was in business and law.
    <br>For the next 30 years, I travelled to many countries, held thousands of crusades
    <br>and spoken to thousands of people over those years.
    <br>After 30 years, I thought I knew it all.
    <br>When you think you know it all, you are in trouble.
    <br>Eleven years ago, somebody gave me a DVD of the meetings in The SCOAN
    <br>and the tremendous healings. I was astounded.
    <br>I mean, I had seen healings, cast out demons and written books on it.
    <br>I was regarded as an authority on it but I had never seen the like of it.
    <br>People were beginning to criticise in the western world and say that
    <br>the people who were claiming to be healed
    <br>were not the same people who were prayed for.
    <br>All sorts of lies began to develop in the western press about our brother.
    <br>So, I felt I should come here.
    <br>The Holy Spirit said, "Come here. Bring some pastors with you,
    <br>bring your sons and check it all out because this is a man of God."
    <br>Evan. Bill Subritzky's Testimony About T.B. Joshua
    <br>We spent 10 days here, listened to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and saw great meetings healings and miracles.
    <br>I took back 15 DVDs with me and began to reprint them
    <br>and distribute them by thousands in our country and other countries.
    <br>The criticism went on but the Holy Spirit always kept saying,
    <br>"This is a man of God. Support him."
    <br>I thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>As he mentioned the criticism which was terrible,
    <br>at the same time, he has weathered the storm.
    <br>He's come through, the enemy is defeated and God has won the victory.
    <br>So, I want to pay a tribute today.
    <br>When I left The SCOAN after receiving impartation from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>I called a public meeting.
    <br>Immediately after receiving the impartation,
    <br>I received a power that I had never known in 30 years of ministry.
    <br>I began to see people miraculously healed. I am not boasting.
    <br>In the name of the Lord, He, by the power of the Spirit
    <br>imparted through Prophet T.B. Joshua, radically transformed my ministry.
    <br>As a result of that and over subsequent crusades,
    <br>I have seen many tens of thousands of people come to Christ
    <br>and seen them healed in the name of Jesus.
    <br>So, my ministry was totally transformed by the power of God through
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, the man of God.
    <br>Today, I want to honour him.
    <br>I have listened to his theology.
    <br>When we went back, all the pastors that were with me checked his theology
    <br>and we were very satisfied that he was teaching the truth about Jesus Christ,
    <br>which he was criticised about.
    <br>But he was doing the truth and we praise God for it.
    <br>So, I believe today is a special day.
    <br>It is an honour for me to be here and to honour Prophet T.B. Joshua in your midst.
    <br>I am going to suggest now that we all stand for one moment in this place.
    <br>Can we all stand for a moment.
    <br>If you are watching on TV, in a moment I am going to ask you to participate.
    <br>What I am going to do is ask everybody to put their hands out
    <br>towards the platform, towards Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We, as the body of Christ,
    <br>are going to honour him at this moment - Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Father, we come in the name of Jesus Christ, as the body of Christ,
    <br>and we thank You for the millions who have entered the Kingdom
    <br>through the ministry that You have given Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We thank You, Lord, for the millions who are yet to enter the Kingdom.
    <br>We pray for dear Prophet T.B. Joshua, his wife Evelyn and their family,
    <br>for Your mighty blessing to be upon them in the days to come,
    <br>in health, strength and for that wonderful anointing that he has
    <br>to be imparted to many others.
    <br>At the same time, we pray that anointing will even increase more in the days to come.
    <br>We thank You for this mighty work that we see here.
    <br>After 11 years, the comparison is not possible.
    <br>We thank You for this mighty work that You have accomplished through him.
    <br>Father, we thank You that the Kingdom of God is being extended hourly through this mighty ministry.
    <br>Your man of God, bless him Father, strengthen him and in every way,
    <br>anoint him as a special servant of Yours.
    <br>We give You all the glory, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>and everybody says, Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Lord. Thank you and God bless you.
