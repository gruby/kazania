  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>There is a wonderful name Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Happy Palm Sunday!
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Many of us don’t know the purpose of life.
    <br>Sometimes, you see people lamenting because of their challenges,
    <br>crying because of their setback, complaining and worrying.
    <br>What is the purpose of life?
    <br>Your purpose of life will never be fulfilled without heat of trial.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your purpose of life will never be fulfilled without heat of trial. "
    <br>It could be setback, affliction, or whatever.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “What is your worry?
    <br>What are you lamenting about?
    <br>What are you complaining about?
    <br>Your purpose of life will never be fulfilled without that."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is no other way.
    <br>So, prepare yourself for the battle.
    <br>Prepare yourself for what?
    <br>For the battle.
    <br>Life is not perfect.
    <br>We are in the world but we are not part of it.
    <br>Life is not perfect.
    <br>We live in a world where the enemy will never allow God’s purpose to be fulfilled in our lives -
    <br>you need to put up a fight.
    <br>That is why we need God.
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>The song says, "This world is not my home"
    <br>There is no way you fall asleep, forgetting yourself...
    <br>We live in a world where the enemy will never allow God’s purpose to be fulfilled in your life -
    <br>we need to put up a fight.
    <br>This is why we need God.
    <br>This is why we are here.
    <br>Let me share a revelation with you.
    <br>Success is not about your weakness;
    <br>success is not about your setback.
    <br>It is about what Jesus did for us at the Cross.
    <br>He made us fit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Jesus made me fit”.
    <br>It’s a past tense event; it’s a past tense victory.
    <br>You are fit.
    <br>Jesus made us fit for God.
    <br>Hear what He said on the Cross.
    <br>He said, “Father, forgive them”.
    <br>The word, “them” includes both the offender and the offended, the accuser and the accused.
    <br>Once your sin is forgiven, what else?
    <br>You are fit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Once my sin is forgiven, what follows? Fitness for God .”
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Jesus made me fit for God”.
    <br>If you have lost that fitness, there is grace for you.
    <br>Spend your time with Him, at His feet, by meditation.
    <br>Meditate on His Word, the Word of God.
    <br>Those of you that want to re-dedicate yourself...
    <br>Because we are fit already; it is a past tense victory.
    <br>When I give you this, you may probably lose it, but we are looking for it again.
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>Meditate on the Word of God and turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>That is...
    <br>Meditation brings revelation
    <br>and revelation brings conviction
    <br>and conviction brings real movement.
    <br>You say, “I’m a child of God”.
    <br>If truly you are a child of God, that is real movement
    <br>and real movement is power steps.
    <br>A real movement brings power.
    <br>Real movement, "I'm a child of God" - power steps...
    <br>Power steps are steps with intent and purpose.
    <br>So, because it is not a true conviction; that is why power does not follow.
    <br>Where God talks, power talks.
    <br>I know many might have lost that grace of being born-again.
    <br>It is a past victory.
    <br>So, here you can come back to the table again, with God.
    <br>Meditate on the Word; turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>Meditation brings conviction and conviction brings real movement.
    <br>That is, "Yes! We are children of God." - it means you become a solider of God.
    <br>You are not alone; God is for you, on your side, behind all.
    <br>You with God are majority - that is a real movement.
    <br>If God is for you, what follows?
    <br>What follows?
    <br>That is it.
    <br>The promise of God brings hope and expectation.
    <br>I can see the hope and expectation.
    <br>You are expecting something!
    <br>I can see you have received promise.
    <br>If I'm talking to you...
    <br>The hope is so great.
    <br>The way you laugh; if someone is expecting something, you will see it in his movement, in his appearance.
    <br>When you are expecting something, you are going to the office -
    <br>somebody promised you million of dollars, and you know that is sure,
    <br>"Good afternoon, sir"...
    <br>But if you doubt what you are going to receive and you are not sure if you receive it...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But what I'm seeing now is very sure.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, I want to congratulate you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is huge.
    <br>This is a real movement, like I have said.
    <br>Real movement brings excitement.
    <br>I mean real excitement.
    <br>Real excitement; look what happened to Peter when Jesus was on the sea.
    <br>Peter said, "Lord, I want to come to You".
    <br>Because the real movement, you can see...
    <br>"I want to come to You."
    <br>He said, "Come!"
    <br>You can see an attempt to come on his own first because Jesus wants to see whether he is genuine.
    <br>Our genuine willingness plus God’s ability brings about the result.
    <br>You can see him with that genuine desire.
    <br>This is what I have seen today.
    <br>I'm just prophesying to you.
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>Yes. Now, what are we talking about?
    <br>That which you are worried about,
    <br>that which you are complaining about
    <br>and that which you are lamenting about -
    <br>the purpose of life will never be fulfilled without that.
    <br>Our walking with the Lord – both good and hard times alike.
    <br>Good and what?
    <br>Hard times.
    <br>Like I have said.
    <br>Success is not about your setback;
    <br>success is not about your failure.
    <br>It is about what Jesus did for you at the Cross.
    <br>All the way to Calvary He went for me
    <br>He went to set me free
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>He went to do what?
    <br>What else again?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Success is not about your failure;
    <br>success is not about your setback.
    <br>Success is about what Jesus did for you at the Cross.
    <br>He made you fit for God."
    <br>He made me fit to receive, to talk to God, to eat with God."
    <br>He went on the Cross to set you free.
    <br>So, what else?
    <br>Spend your time with Him and learn at His feet.
    <br>How do we learn at His feet?
    <br>By meditation.
    <br>Meditate on the Word; turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>It is not the way we are reading the Bible today.
    <br>The Bible is not just a book; it’s an inspiring one.
    <br>So, if truly you are a child of God, you talk of real movement
    <br>and real movement brings excitement.
    <br>Even when there is no food on the table you are excited.
    <br>Nobody will even know the difference when there is money in your pocket, and when there is no money
    <br>because your life will remain the same.
    <br>People will not know.
    <br>Because you know; money in the pocket does not make you a child of God,
    <br>and lack of money in your pocket does not make you a child of God.
    <br>Your vision is different from money in the pocket.
    <br>The man that is poor is the man that has no vision.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>You can know if this man is a true child of God
    <br>because real movement brings excitement and the promise of God brings hope and expectation.
    <br>But no hope...
    <br>A man without hope - you can see;
    <br>the appearance - nothing to write about.
    <br>Each time you have a little problem, people around you will know
    <br>and each time you have money, people around you will know.
    <br>What kind of life is this?
    <br>How can your situation dictate your direction, or rule you?
    <br>When you are good, you smile, when you are not good you run.
    <br>What kind of Christian is that?
    <br>What is the difference between you and the others?
    <br>Because those are the things that dictate their direction, their life, their mood, their dominion.
    <br>Those are the things that dictate their posture.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, “What is the difference between you and others?”
    <br>Others are happy when there is food on the table.
    <br>You are happy when there is money in your pocket.
    <br>You are happy when there is food on the table.
    <br>How can your situation rule your life?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The difference between us and others is simple:
    <br>We are happy when there is money in our pocket
    <br>and also we are happy when there is no money in our pocket
    <br>because the man that is poor is not the man that has no money but the man without vision.
    <br>Think about all this.
    <br>Your purpose in life will never be fulfilled without heat of trial.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(Your purpose in life will never be fulfilled without heat of trial.)
    <br>Your purpose in life will never be fulfilled without setback, temptation or affliction.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Once again, “Happy Palm Sunday!”
    <br>I'm happy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm just trying to listen to the sound of your clapping, to see whether...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>When you listen to that sound, you can know whether it is a joyful one, pretentious one or pretentious calm.
    <br>But the one I'm hearing now... hmm.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, it is your heart that is clapping.
    <br>It's not you.
    <br>And when our heart claps, God claps.
    <br>So, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>So, you are taking this lesson home.
    <br>Can somebody talk to me, what lesson are you taking home?
    <br>We want just a little counsel, what lesson are you taking home?
    <br>Brother, what are you taking home?
    <br>What do you hear me saying?
    <br>OK, what I'm taking home is that in this life I cannot escape challenges - this is number one.
    <br>Number two; I may by poor physically but the real poverty is when I live without a vision.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>That is your lesson - that is wonderful.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>Our father wants to talk.
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>He says, it seems, he will not be able to escape challenges.
    <br>And when that challenges come, they are meant to prepare him for the future.
    <br>- My name is... from Niger State.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>I learned the lesson from your message that there are no successes in life without challenges.
    <br>Challenges are just like fertilizers to make you very strong.
    <br>Clap for him!
    <br>Look at him, look at my brother; he says that challenges are fertilizers.
    <br>That is the tonic to our anointing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Challenges are like a fertilizer to improve us.
    <br>Challenges are like a tonic to our anointing."
    <br>You hear that; that's all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't forget; your challenges can be an affliction, hardship, temptation, setback, joblessness.
    <br>Try to understand that.
    <br>When you know that; yes - you have overcome.
    <br>Challenges are tonic, fertilizer.
    <br>So, why are we lamenting then?
    <br>Why are we worried?
    <br>When challenges come, once you worry, the purpose has been defeated.
    <br>Debts...
    <br>When you are worried, your heart will be in prison at the same time.
    <br>Worry imprisons our heart.
    <br>When your heart is imprisoned, you cannot communicate with your Heavenly Father.
    <br>You need a free heart to communicate, to talk to God.
    <br>When you have sickness and you are worried, then the purpose of that challenges has been defeated;
    <br>I mean you are in prison.
    <br>Once our heart is in prison we are finished.
    <br>Don’t worry yourself; leave it for God.
    <br>Once you worry, your heart is in prison because a joyful heart is for God.
    <br>Take note of this.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Worry means fear.
    <br>The sickness and challenge does not kill the fear of it kills.
    <br>The challenge does not kill but the fear of it destroys.
    <br>It is the fear of that challenge that destroys us, that destroys our relationship with God.
    <br>Fear would take you to occultist, witch-doctor, fear can take one to joining a secret cult.
    <br>Fear will make you to begin to look at Jesus in a very bad light.
    <br>With fear you cannot read your Bible, you cannot pray - whom are you praying to?
    <br>The word fear means worry.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Bible says, in this world there will be what?
    <br>Challenges.
    <br>Put it that way, “In this world, there will be challenges; cheer up – stop worrying – I have overcome.”
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In this world... this is why I say that the life is not perfect.
    <br>In this world, there will be challenges, situation; cheer up - stop worrying, lamenting, complaining -
    <br>that is the meaning of "cheer up".
    <br>The reason for stopping complaining; "I have overcome for you".
    <br>This is why Jesus said, He made us fit – meaning, He has overcome for you.
    <br>Once you are fit, you can face it.
    <br>Can we hear from our mummy or sister...?
    <br>OK.
    <br>You just tell us from the different angle.
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>I have learned that I'm not supposed to live the way others live in the world.
    <br>Even if there is no money...
    <br>Why you are not supposed to live the way others live?
    <br>Because; even if I don't have money in my pocket...
    <br>No, because you are a child of God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is not an issue of money.
    <br>When I say, "Your situation is different from others; as a child of God..."
    <br>If one has cancer and doctor discovered it by test, "this is cancer", and you are a child of God -
    <br>that cancer is different from others.
    <br>Other's cancers kill, destroy, but a Christian's that have a cancer - their cancer strengthens their desire.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That situation is to improve him, not to impair him.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>They can say, this man has cancer and this man has cancer.
    <br>The question is who is this man and who is this man.
    <br>It is not the cancer that matters.
    <br>Can't you see what I'm saying?
    <br>Success is not about your situation.
    <br>Success is not about your setback;
    <br>success is not about you.
    <br>Who is that man? 
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>It will determine the kind of cancer he has.
    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>It will determine the kind of situation he has.
    <br>This man belongs to others; meaning unbelievers.
    <br>When others have that situation; the cancer is a killer - they cannot escape it.
    <br>But a child of God with that situation – God is still saying something.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God can use anything to speak to us.
    <br>You can be going to work in the morning and suddenly you see a python on the way,
    <br>laying on the very road you need to pass - a big one.
    <br>And you are a type of a person that is always afraid.
    <br>What would you do?
    <br>You will even give that python your ID card in your bag, before you run.
    <br>Everything; you will just drop it on the python and start running.
    <br>And python did not ask you to give him the bag and the money.
    <br>After you had dropped it, because of fear, you started running...
    <br>God is still saying something; God does not want you to go to work.
    <br>If you went to work, something worse would have happened.
    <br>But to send you back home, something that can threaten you... like cancer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You start running, you abandon your...
    <br>By the time you get home, something will happen in the office.
    <br>You say, "Ah! Something happened?"
    <br>This is what God is trying to remove you from.
    <br>He often uses those things to preserve us, to stop you awhile in order to rearrange you.
    <br>Because you are too fast.
    <br>You are blessed; God gave you blessing and you received it.
    <br>This is a small office, where you are supposed to remain and continue your business.
    <br>Because when the money come, you will start opening offices everywhere and it will become a burden to you.
    <br>Now, situation may come and the whole office will be closed down, or you yourself will fall sick
    <br>and if you cannot run the office while being sick, the office will close down.
    <br>That does not mean the end has come.
    <br>... but to stop you awhile in order to rearrange you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell us the kind of situation in the past, God might have used...
    <br>- Emmanuel!
    <br>- OK, thank you.
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>My name is Albert.
    <br>My past situation that God used - I was in prison; that was the time I spent reading the Bible.
    <br>That was the time I got to know God and learnt more about God, while I was in prison.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>Because he is aware that God used that situation to strengthen him, to prepare him, to strengthen his desire
    <br>and determination for God, he will never regret.
    <br>It is when we regret... this is when we continue to make more mistakes.
    <br>But he is thanking God; and he is not even regretting, he is happy - and that situation was not wasted.
    <br>God was still saying something.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Can somebody stand up and tell us the kind of situation God might have used in the past to prepare you
    <br>or to rearrange you, or to stop you awhile?
    <br>OK.
    <br>My name is ... from Ghana.
    <br>About two years ago, when I first got into arm forces, everything was rosy.
    <br>I passed my first promotional exams.
    <br>I got married, when I wanted to get married.
    <br>A month after my marriage I had a child, so I thought life would be like that.
    <br>But I realised that when I wanted a second child, it wasn't coming.
    <br>I started complaining, and feeling anguish.
    <br>Then, a time came for me to do my second promotional exams to the next stage;
    <br>I tried and I failed the practical part.
    <br>This situation made me to go more to church, read more the Bible, seek the face of God more.
    <br>To the glory of God, at His appointed time, I did the second try of the practical part and I passed the exam.
    <br>At His right time, He has given me a second fruit of the womb.
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>So, what is your relationship with God now?
    <br>Are you fully persuaded concerning the Word of God?
    <br>Now, nothing would take me away from the love of God.
    <br>More than before?
    <br>More than before.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Now, I seek the face of God more, in all situations.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>And don't forget to carry those children along with you.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- OK?
    <br>Don't forget to carry those children God has given you.
    <br>When it comes to the issue of God, anywhere you step for God, allow them to step with you.
    <br>- OK?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>That is the greatest legacy you can give to your children.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I will.
    <br>Our mummy here mentioned two miracles, at first...
    <br>Once one is disappointed, worry comes; you begin to worry.
    <br>When you are worried, your heart will never be at its best.
    <br>Once you are heart is not at its best, you are in prison.
    <br>The heart that is in prison cannot communicate with the Heavenly Father.
    <br>When you go around; that is the challenge many of us are facing.
    <br>When we bring your heart out now, you will see within that heart worry, anxiety, pain of the past, offence.
    <br>Such heart cannot see God.
    <br>Blessed are the hearts that are pure.
    <br>So, these are the challenges we are facing.
    <br>And satan is aware of that; the only way he can get you is to make you worried, to make sure that the engine
    <br>of your car knocks.
    <br>When it is knocked, and it is time to go to church you say, "Ah. No, I cannot go to the church.
    <br>The engine of my car is knocked."
    <br>And you are forgetting that before you had that car, you were sleeping in the church.
    <br>You were even trekking from your house to the church but God has given you a car now
    <br>and the engine is knocked; you cannot come to church.
    <br>OK, let's listen to...
    <br>- Emmanuel!
    <br>- (God with us.)
    <br>"Alive" example to me.. it was in 2016; I was very sick.
    <br>I was taken to hospital.
    <br>I was having a stomach problem.
    <br>They run a lot of tests.
    <br>The doctor said they could not discover what the problem was but they would operate me.
    <br>I refused it; I said no.
    <br>They asked why.
    <br>I said I had a God, "Let me go and meet my God".
    <br>Luckily for me I went to...
    <br>Can I say something?
    <br>Will I believe that you have a God; that's why you refused the operation, or because of fear of death?
    <br>No, please - let us talk...
    <br>These two questions; this is clear to me because this is what I discover.
    <br>No. You tried all means.
    <br>Finally, operation was the last option, when they said, "No way"...
    <br>But for you to say, "After a lot of tests, they discovered they must do an operation..."
    <br>And you said to doctors, "No. I have a God."
    <br>That God would have done it first, and you would go for test to see the positive result.
    <br>When that trouble was so much, you would have gone to that God, of which you know is an "Alfa and Omega";
    <br>He would have done it and you would just go to doctor, "Test me. The sickness is gone."
    <br>But in this case, we have done tests, the pain was so much...
    <br>Later, they said there was nothing they could do, they had to operate you.
    <br>No! I have a God!
    <br>Let's hear from you.
    <br>So, I...
    <br>What later happened to your God?
    <br>I went to church and I prayed and I was made whole, I was healed, the pain disappeared.
    <br>I didn't take any drug, I didn't go back to the hospital.
    <br>There is nothing bad in taking the drug.
    <br>But the pain went away.
    <br>If you don’t believe God with your tablets, you will not believe God without tablets.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you don’t believe God with your tablets, you will not believe God without tablets."
    <br>Tell your neighbour!
    <br>(If you don’t believe God with your tablets, you will not believe God without tablets.)
    <br>This tablet is "nature"...
    <br>What is the difference between different juices you put together in the morning,
    <br>and the tablet you are talking about?
    <br>There is no difference.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is nature, and God is the God of nature.
    <br>I want you to clap for my sister because you took us to many areas people want to hear.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>- You have more to say?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>OK, say it.
    <br>Another case was...
    <br>When I wrote my first JAMB, I couldn't get that score for the course I wanted to do.
    <br>OK.
    <br>So, I had to pray and fast.
    <br>I told God, "This is the course I want to attend. Just help me..."
    <br>But that JAMB; you had first choice and second choice.
    <br>Yeah, but there is a particular...
    <br>Wait! Answer my question.
    <br>You know where I'm going.
    <br>- You had a first and a second choice?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>There is no alternative for our faith.
    <br>My first and second choice are the same thing, but I have different...
    <br>You know what many choices normally cause?
    <br>It cause you not to put all your effort, "You know, if I lose this I will go to this."
    <br>But if it is only only one course you apply for, you know there is no other way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>Thank you, my sister.
    <br>The big challenge; what happens to us, happens also to our children.
    <br>We always have alternatives...
    <br>Some will sit here and say, "Ah. If that pain is not going away, I will go to that place. But today let me stay.
    <br>Next week, I will not come here, I will go to another place."
    <br>We always have alternatives to our lives.
    <br>Alternatives...
    <br>Those are the same alternatives that have ruined us today.
    <br>... not only us but also our children.
    <br>One faith, one love, one God, one Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You listen to me?
    <br>One God, one love, one faith, one Holy Ghost.
    <br>Alternative...
    <br>The whole thing is all over the world today.
    <br>I hope you are getting your faith back.
    <br>Some faiths are very weak, with what we are hearing now.
    <br>Some of our mummies, daddies and those who are sick; you see them with the placard...
    <br>Some of you, when you see them with the sickness, affliction, you say, "Ah. It is because of their sin.
    <br>Ah. This is why they come to the church."
    <br>Ah ah...
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(A man can be sick in body and yet be a friend of God.)
    <br>A man can be sick; that sickness could be anything: cancer, HIV...
    <br>Sickness is sickness.
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a favourite of Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Today, you see people dying in silence because they don't want people to see them sick.
    <br>"What people would say?"
    <br>They would say, "They are not Christians. He is not a pastor."
    <br>They keep...
    <br>They can disclose their trouble to the doctor but to God... no.
    <br>A man can be poor and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>We should not allow our wealth, blessing, situation, condition to dictate or rule our life.
    <br>Be careful; the outcome of your prayer should not affect your faith.
    <br>Because you prayed and your prayer is not answered does not mean you do not have faith.
    <br>We base our faith on the outcome of our prayer.
    <br>People today base their faith on the outcome...
    <br>"I don't have faith; that is why my prayer is not answered. I will not pray." - No...
    <br>Stop basing your faith on the outcome of your prayer.
    <br>Some stand and, "In Jesus' name" - they would say, "This man has so much faith.
    <br>Look, he commanded and it happened, but I keep commanding and no way." - No.
    <br>Don’t base your faith on the outcome of your prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(Don’t base your faith on the outcome of your prayer.)
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>My name is ...
    <br>In 2016, when papa was telling us about forgiveness; there was a man that started crying at the audience.
    <br>It was 14th of February 2016.
    <br>He was crying that he have helped people and all of them have failed him.
    <br>I was in the overflow congregation in Ghana church.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After the service I called the friend, but deep inside me I haven't forgiven him, I still bore some grudges in me.
    <br>It took me some years.
    <br>Last year in December, facing difficulties in my life, I called this friend, but there was no answer.
    <br>Deep in me, God asked me to call that friend that had hurt me previously and I didn't forgive him.
    <br>I forgave him and went to him.
    <br>At that point of my life; everything that I wanted for all those years came back within one month.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Good.
    <br>This is a testimony people need to hear.
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>The dividend of forgiveness.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Listen to him.
    <br>Forgive and see what follows -
    <br>what you have been looking for for many years, what you have been praying for will come.
    <br>Forgive and see what follows.
    <br>I believe your faith is lifted up.
    <br>I will take it once again;
    <br>being a child of God is a movement – not just a movement but a real one.
    <br>“I am a born again” this is a real movement and a movement brings excitement.
    <br>If truly you are a child of God – excitement.
    <br>Even when money is not in the pocket, be excited.
    <br>When there is no food on the table, be excited.
    <br>It honours God when we believe in Him when things look rough.
    <br>Things look wrong, when there is no money in your pocket and you believe in Him - it honours Him so much,
    <br>more than when there is money in the pocket.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “It honours God more to believe in Him when there is no money in the pocket
    <br>than when there is money in the pocket.
    <br>It honours God more to believe in Him when there is no food on the table
    <br>than when there is food on the table.
    <br>Are you with me now?
    <br>What am I saying?
    <br>It honours Him more whey you believe in Him when you are sick that when you are not sick.
    <br>It honours Him so greatly, so much when you are sick and you believe in Him
    <br>more than when you are not sick and you believe in Him.
    <br>This is what satan has been using to rob us; our blessing.
    <br>Once we are sick, we cannot pray.
    <br>Once we are sick, faith is gone.
    <br>We begin to look at Jesus in a very bad light, "What have I done? Why this sickness?
    <br>I'm doing well, I'm going to church, I've stopped smoking, I've stopped lying..."
    <br>as if you are the one who stopped that smoking.
    <br>Has anyone power to stop smoking or lying?
    <br>(No.)
    <br>Truth is not our work but lying is our work.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(Truth is not our work but lying is our work.)
    <br>To say the truth is not our work; it is God’s work but to tell lies is our work.
    <br>We are very good at it.
    <br>No - this is what you should know.
    <br>To tell lies - yes, that is our work.
    <br>But truth - how can you say, "I stopped smoking"?
    <br>To smoke is our work but to stop is not our work; it is God’s work.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>To drink is our work.
    <br>To stop drinking is not our work; it is God’s work.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(To stop drinking is not our work; it is God’s work.)
    <br>Every, every like that...
    <br>To destroy...
    <br>Destruction is our work.
    <br>To build is not our work; it is God’s work.
    <br>How can you say, "Why all this now? I've stopped lying. Why all this sickness?"
    <br>Is it your work to stop?
    <br>Can you stop?
    <br>(No.)
    <br>Even if you try to stop on your own...
    <br>You stopped smoking on your own; when you sleep you smoke...
    <br>You will smoke...
    <br>This is what has happened; you smoke in the dream - by the time you wake up you start looking for a cigarette.
    <br>I hope you are blessed.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Thank you.
