    464 - How To STOP Bad Habits!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Let's look at the Book of James.
    <br>James 1:1
    <br>"James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings.
    <br>My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
    <br>knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
    <br>But let patience have its perfect work,
    <br>that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
    <br>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God,
    <br>who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him."
    <br>Let me go to verse 22.
    <br>"But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves."
    <br>The message's title:
    <br>THE FUTILITY OF SELF-EFFORT
    <br>Give me your heart.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Let me take you back to the Book of Psalms 66:18.
    <br>"If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me."
    <br>Take note of the words, 'In my heart'.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>"If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me."
    <br>Going by the song,
    <br>we are made in our heart to be like Jesus.
    <br>On the last day, we will be judged not by the colour of our skin
    <br>but by the content of our character.
    <br>On the last day
    <br>Only true believers shall be raptured
    <br>On the last day
    <br>Only true believers shall be raptured
    <br>Do you know there is another Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know there is another Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know that Jesus is my Saviour
    <br>We will be judged not by the colour of our skin but by the content of our character.
    <br>True Christianity lies in the heart, in the purity of the heart.
    <br>Book of James 1:22.
    <br>"But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves."
    <br>Many Bible students, church people and Christians are deceiving themselves
    <br>because they are not acting, living and doing the Word.
    <br>When you look at the Book of Colossians 3:10:
    <br>The mind is renewed by studying the Word and by acting upon it.
    <br>One may read or study the Bible for years.
    <br>If he or she does not act it, live it, is not a doer, the mind is not renewed.
    <br>In Colossians 3:10:
    <br>The mind is renewed by studying the Word and by acting upon it.
    <br>One may read or study the Word for years.
    <br>If he or she does not act it, live it, is not a doer, the mind is not renewed.
    <br>Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>Meditation in the Word is a visit to Him.
    <br>The Word becomes a part of us by meditation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Word becomes a part of you by meditation".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[The Word becomes a part of you by meditation.]
    <br>Meditation in the Word is a visit to God.
    <br>If you want to visit Him, meditate in the Word.
    <br>It is the Word dwelling in you which is equivalent
    <br>to Christ personally being in you.
    <br>The Word dominating you is the Lordship of Christ in you.
    <br>If you want to visit Him, meditate in His Word.
    <br>Today, many church people pray in the name of Jesus but within is doubt.
    <br>We must lift to God not only clean hands but a pure heart.
    <br>When you say, "Inner my heart" -
    <br>not only your hand but your heart must also be pure.
    <br>We must lift up to God not only clean hands but a pure heart.
    <br>We claim to stop our bad habits without but within the urge to do them continues.
    <br>When you stop your bad habit with self-effort...
    <br>You know, there is self-effort and God's effort.
    <br>God's effort is grace.
    <br>When you stop your bad habit with self-effort,
    <br>the urge to do them will continue
    <br>because self-effort cannot stop the urge but God's effort only can.
    <br>Many become Christians, born-again, pastors, bishops, prophets, with self-effort.
    <br>Self-effort leaves us with urge.
    <br>That which comes out of the heart defiles the man.
    <br>Self-effort is a wrong attitude towards sin.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit destroying the root of sin in us,
    <br>we are bound to be tormented from desire to return to our bad habits.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit destroying the root of sin in us,
    <br>we are bound to be tormented from desire to return to our bad habits.
    <br>The challenges many Christian believers are facing
    <br>is the problem of urge behind closed doors.
    <br>Urge to push this - they will not push this thing, but there is an urge to push it.
    <br>If there is an urge to push this thing and you are not pushing, you are in bondage.
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>I have the urge to slap you but I cannot because I'm a Christian.
    <br>That urge will put me in bondage.
    <br>Those who are inwardly pure show themselves to be under the power of pure.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Those who are inwardly pure show themselves to be under the power of pure."
    <br>If I have the urge to slap you but because people know me as a pastor -
    <br>if I slap you, that is the end, you will not believe me anymore.
    <br>Because I want to keep my name in the eyes of people, not in the eyes of God -
    <br>the urge to slap you is there but people are looking at me who know me as a pastor;
    <br>if I slap you, that is the end of my career.
    <br>I will resist that, but that urge is there - I'm in bondage - God cannot hear me.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit destroying the root of sin in us,
    <br>we are bound to be tormented from desire to return to our bad habits.
    <br>After stopping your bad habits by self-effort, the urge to do them continues.
    <br>Self-effort cannot stop the urge but God's effort, grace, only can.
    <br>This is where the word "contentment" comes in.
    <br>I'm a pastor.
    <br>No matter what I'm doing here; if there is an urge in me to do more...
    <br>What do I need again?
    <br>I will say, "Let me carry the money I have to become a car dealer.
    <br>Let me join politics.
    <br>Let me do this, that..."
    <br>Because there is an urge;
    <br>instead of me to think of how to expand the coasts of this Kingdom of God,
    <br>save more souls, deliver more people,
    <br>which is very possible,
    <br>the urge for this or that...
    <br>"I'm the president. Who is my wife - she is not fit enough.
    <br>I need a professor as a wife to follow me anywhere I'm going."
    <br>Many first ladies are not first wives.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have many business cards in your pocket.
    <br>You are an architect, contractor, lawyer, doctor, pastor at the same time.
    <br>It is all caused by urge.
    <br>You continue to chase it.
    <br>We have people that have 500 houses only in Lagos State
    <br>but they don't even know the number of houses they have - it is all caused by urge.
    <br>You are here today, you will look around to see the appearance of people.
    <br>Women will want to look at hair styles, "Oh, I like this style".
    <br>Tomorrow, you will begin to look for a hairdresser that will make your hair in the same way.
    <br>You will draw a picture, "This is the way I want my hair to be".
    <br>Every day, you keep changing the style of your hair.
    <br>Urge.
    <br>Are you talking of your colour?
    <br>You keep changing the colour, until the skin is destroyed.
    <br>Urge...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You don't mind to loan money to buy a car, because you like a certain car,
    <br>"Oh, this is the latest".
    <br>Are you talking of your iPad?
    <br>The manufacturer knows that when they release a new iPad today, you will drop the one you have.
    <br>You keep running after it - the latest handset, iPad.
    <br>If you don't have money, you will get money at all costs to get the latest technology.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>In self-effort, we only commit God's Word to memory, which is valuable,
    <br>but God's effort, grace is letting the Word become an integral part of us.
    <br>Self-effort cannot bring Jesus to the scene.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, be healed!"
    <br>Jesus cannot come to the scene, with one's self-effort to be born-again.
    <br>By self-effort you become a pastor, bishop or prophet, a Christian.
    <br>God's effort, grace brings Jesus to the scene.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith out of our mouth.
    <br>The happiness of seeing Jesus is promised to those
    <br>and those only who are pure in heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The happiness of seeing Jesus is promised to those
    <br>and those only who are pure in heart."
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The happiness of carrying out God's commission is promised to those
    <br>and those only who are pure in heart.
    <br>To carry out God's commission...
    <br>The Bible says, "Go into the world and preach the Gospel".
    <br>You say, "OK, let me go and preach the Gospel",
    <br>whereas inwardly you are not there.
    <br>You were in that business in the past.
    <br>You go out preaching the Gospel, "Jesus is Lord. You have to accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour",
    <br>whereas inwardly you are not pure.
    <br>And the Bible says,
    <br>the happiness of carrying out God's commission is promised to those
    <br>and those only who are pure in heart.
    <br>"Be healed, be delivered, be saved, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>When one says, "Be healed!" and you are healed -
    <br>you should know that inwardly something is there.
    <br>It's not what you say that really matters but the source.
    <br>If I said to you, "Be healed, in Jesus' name!" -
    <br>don't mind what I said because satan too can say, "Be healed, in Jesus name!"
    <br>You don't need a lesson to say, "Be healed".
    <br>Anybody can say, "Be healed, in Jesus' name".
    <br>What you should bother about is the source of that "Be healed, in Jesus' name".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I believe your faith is lifted up - let me see your hand.
    <br>After stopping your bad habits by self-effort -
    <br>"I will not drink again. I will not go there again" - you keep yourself -
    <br>the urge to do them continues because self-effort cannot stop the urge.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>The FUTILITY Of Self-Effort
    <br>After stopping your bad habits by self-effort, the urge to do them continues.
    <br>Self-effort cannot stop the urge but God's effort, grace, only can.
    <br>The FUTILITY Of Self-Effort
    <br>We are made in our heart to be like Jesus.
    <br>On the last day, we will be judged not by the colour of our skin
    <br>but by the content of our character.
    <br>The FUTILITY Of Self-Effort
    <br>There is self-effort and God's effort.
    <br>God's effort is grace.
    <br>When you stop your bad habit with self-effort,
    <br>the urge to do them will continue
    <br>because self-effort cannot stop the urge but God's effort only can.
    <br>The FUTILITY Of Self-Effort
    <br>Self-effort is a wrong attitude towards sin.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit destroying the root of sin in us,
    <br>we are bound to be tormented from desire to return to our bad habits.
