    <br>Can somebody say, "Thank You, Jesus"?
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Lord!"
    <br>Say, "Lord, You are good".
    <br>Say, "My Lord is good all the time and, all the time, the Lord is good!"
    <br>- Do you believe that?
    <br>- [Yes!]
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Racine.
    <br>I come from Djolof.
    <br>Do you know Djolof?
    <br>Somebody say, "No.You know Djolof".
    <br>You don't know Djolof, but you know jollof rice.
    <br>Do you know jollof rice?
    <br>I come from the country of jollof rice.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Where I was born is called Djolof; we call the people "Djolof Djolof".
    <br>These are the ones that invented this jollof rice - this sweet jollof rice.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>When I came to Nigeria, one day I was watching a famous news TV programme,
    <br>and the presenter was talking about Nigeria.
    <br>He said, "This is one of the delicacies of Nigeria - jollof rice."
    <br>I said, "Wait a minute. There is a problem."
    <br>"Jollof rice is from Djolof, from Senegal, not from Nigeria!"
    <br>But I tasted Nigerian jollof rice and I found it reliable, wonderful, so sweet.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am not here to say who is the best.
    <br>I would receive emails today.
    <br>Those who have tasted Nigerian and Senegalese jollof rice will be in the best position to judge,
    <br>and they are here; I know them.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>But there is another one.
    <br>There is one jollof rice from Heaven.
    <br>That one, only a man of faith can taste it.
    <br>I believe I'm talking to men of faith.
    <br>Am I talking to believers?
    <br>That one is called "Manna".
    <br>Let someone say, "Manna - jollof Manna".
    <br>I call it jollof Manna.
    <br>Say, "Jollof Manna".
    <br>When you eat it, you will hunger no more.
    <br>When you eat it, it gives eternal life.
    <br>David said, "Your Words are sweeter than honey to my taste" - Psalm 119:103.
    <br>Am I talking to believers today?
    <br>I believe I am.
    <br>When you ask anybody today, "Are you a believer?"
    <br>When you ask anybody in the world today, "Are you a man of faith or a woman of faith?"
    <br>The answer will probably be, "Yes."
    <br>But when you examine the object of their faith,
    <br>you will realize that if they have faith in anything, it is in what man can do.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>Science, works, organization.
    <br>The question is: How do you know that you are a child of God?
    <br>How do you know that you are a child of the Most High God?
    <br>Because Hebrews 11:6 says, "Only faith pleases God."
    <br>Only faith pleases God Almighty.
    <br>How do you know you are a Christian?
    <br>How do you know you are a child of God?
    <br>Today we say we are children of God because we have stopped lying,
    <br>because we have stopped smoking,
    <br>because we have stopped drinking.
    <br>We boast of all these because it is our doing: our self-righteousness.
    <br>Self - I have stopped smoking.
    <br>Self - I have stopped drinking.
    <br>Self - I have stopped holding grudges.
    <br>This is boasting.
    <br>God's righteousness is a gift from God.
    <br>Why is it a gift?
    <br>Because we are undeserving.
    <br>Let someone say, "We are undeserving".
    <br>This means no one can stop lying, no one can stop smoking, no one can stop drinking
    <br>without God's involvement.
    <br>What do I mean by God's involvement?
    <br>God is waiting for anyone at the point of His Spirit.
    <br>I mean, without the Holy Spirit destroying the root of sin in us,
    <br>we are bound to be tormented to turn back to our bad habits.
    <br>I repeat.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit destroying the root of sin in our heart,
    <br>we are bound to be tormented to turn back to our bad habits.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In an attempt to stop lying without God, though you may stop, the urge of lying is still there.
    <br>Let someone say, "There".
    <br>In an attempt to stop smoking, drinking, bearing grudges without God,
    <br>though you may stop drinking, smoking, holding grudges, the urge of smoking,
    <br>the urge of drinking will not leave you.
    <br>It is still there.
    <br>"Thou shall not kill", but the urge of killing is still there.
    <br>"Thou shall not lie", but the urge of lying is still there.
    <br>This is what happens to so many Christians all over the world today.
    <br>We seem to stop all these, but the urge of all these is still there.
    <br>The Christians we have today are based on their self-righteousness.
    <br>I mean, on their own way of belief.
    <br>Today you see man who never confess defeat find themselves in the realm of defeat,
    <br>because man's belief cannot tap God's blessings.
    <br>Let me encourage your faith today.
    <br>There is man's belief and God's belief - human and divine.
    <br>A consciousness of little faith is far from being the reason why you should not pray.
    <br>You are not called upon to look within you to see
    <br>how much faith you have, how strong you are.
    <br>You are called to look to God, to go to Him and take from Him the faith you need -
    <br>the faith He is prepared to give you.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, I believe; help me overcome my unbelief."
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>Say, "Lord, I believe; help me overcome my unbelief."
    <br>Again!
    <br>[Lord, I believe; help me overcome my unbelief.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Lord, I believe; help me overcome my unbelief.]
    <br>This is our message today:
    <br>I BELIEVE; HELP ME OVERCOME MY UNBELIEF
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Mark 9:23.
    <br>"Jesus said to him, 'If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.'
    <br>Immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears,
    <br>'Lord, I believe; help my unbelief!'
    <br>When Jesus saw that the people came running together,
    <br>He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it,
    <br>'Deaf and dumb spirit, I command you, come out of him and enter him no more!'
    <br>Then the spirit cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out of him.
    <br>And he became as one dead, so that many said, 'He is dead.' "
    <br>Verse 29:
    <br>"So He said to them, 'This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting.' "
    <br>Say, "Lord, I believe; help my unbelief."
    <br>When we come to Jesus, we think we believe - I mean, our own way of belief -
    <br>until we realize the weakness of our faith. Then we run to Jesus and say,
    <br>"Lord, help my unbelief."
    <br>There is trouble in the house, you have a problem in your marriage.
    <br>The marriage is at the brink of collapse.
    <br>As a woman or man of faith, you say, "Lord, I claim Your promises!
    <br>Lord, give me the victory! I call upon Your name.
    <br>Lord, restoration! Lord, victory!"
    <br>You pray, you fast, you engage.
    <br>At the end you rejoice, "Lord, I thank You because I know You have heard me.
    <br>Lord, I thank You because I know it is done already."
    <br>But after a little while,
    <br>a message comes to the phone,
    <br>you open and immediately the same person who prayed begins to cry, weep,
    <br>because of the message that came to the phone:
    <br>Court case for divorce.
    <br>You begin to worry as if you have never prayed before.
    <br>You begin to cry as if you have never prayed before.
    <br>When our heart is uneasy,
    <br>when we are fearful - fear for this, fear for that - when all hope seems to be lost,
    <br>this shows we have not yet believed.
    <br>Because whenever we truly believe, our heart is at rest.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>whenever we truly believe, our heart is at rest."
    <br>This is the case of the demon-possessed boy's father,
    <br>who, after realizing the weakness of his faith,
    <br>came to Jesus and said, "Lord, I believe; help my unbelief."
    <br>He was saying to Jesus, "Lord, I'm kind, obedient, faithful."
    <br>He was boasting in all this,
    <br>while the urge, weakness was still there.
    <br>When you discover the weakness of your faith, then you will discover your need for God.
    <br>When he realized the weakness of his faith, he ran to Jesus and cried for help,
    <br>"Lord, help my unbelief".
    <br>How could He help him?
    <br>To help him is to stop him acknowledge that he is the one doing it. No!
    <br>Until you acknowledge it is God helping you, then it is God's belief.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour. I believe; help me overcome my unbelief."
    <br>Today, we are like the demon-possessed boy's father,
    <br>claiming to be Christians, believers, while the urge for the fruits of the flesh is still there.
    <br>Let someone say, "There".
    <br>The question:
    <br>Where does the urge come from?
    <br>Who can answer the question?
    <br>Where does the urge come from?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The urge comes from satan, the architect of the life of the person that is still living away (from God).
    <br>Do you hear that?
    <br>"Who is there? Knock, knock." - knock at the door of your heart.
    <br>Say, "Who is there?"
    <br>Say, "My heart - the inner man. My heart - the seat of will, emotions, affections."
    <br>This is where prayer comes from.
    <br>This is where meditation comes from.
    <br>Can we say faith is of your heart when urge is of the heart?
    <br>Can we?
    <br>Who then is the landlord - is it faith, is it urge?
    <br>Who then is the tenant - is it faith, is it urge?
    <br>This is what causes conflict in our heart: a battle.
    <br>Let someone say, "A battle between faith and urge".
    <br>Urge to lie, to smoke, to drink, urge, urge, urge.
    <br>Our God is a jealous God.
    <br>He wants to be the Landlord of your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My God is a jealous God.
    <br>He wants to be the Landlord of my heart."
    <br>He does not share apartment with anyone.
    <br>Are you a Christian?
    <br>Because faith is of the heart.
    <br>Are you a Christian?
    <br>Because true Christianity lies in the heart, in the purity of the heart.
    <br>"I am a good man."
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>"I am a loving person."
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>"I am an obedient person. I am a faithful person."
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>"I forgive everyone."
    <br>Has your heart forgiven?
    <br>Are you such in heart?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is when you are such in heart that you are a child of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It is when you are such in heart that you are a child of God."
    <br>But today we are like the demon-possessed boy's father
    <br>who claim to be a Christian while the urge for the fruits of the flesh is still there.
    <br>This is what the Lord meant.
    <br>Today, our Christianity is of our mouth, not our heart.
    <br>Say, "My heart - the inner man.
    <br>My heart - the man himself."
    <br>My heart.
    <br>Just because a person calls himself a Christian does not mean he is a believer.
    <br>Our heart is the avenue, our heart is the landing point,
    <br>our heart is God's station.
    <br>Our heart is the contact point, the communication point for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Only God knows who is a child of God.
    <br>Only God knows who is a true believer.
    <br>Some say, "Oh, this is a good, loving man".
    <br>Today our Christianity is of the mouth, not of the heart.
    <br>That is what Jesus meant when He said, "You, unbelieving generation,
    <br>how long shall I put up with you? How long shall I bear with you?
    <br>Bring the boy to Me."
    <br>Jesus was simply saying, "With our mouth we confess; with our heart we believe."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>with my mouth I confess; with my heart I believe."
    <br>This reminds me of the case of Tyson Fury and Wilder.
    <br>Do you know them?
    <br>They fought for the heavy weight championship title.
    <br>This man - Tyson Fury - has been confessing Jesus Christ,
    <br>"Jesus is Lord. Jesus is the Saviour,"
    <br>right from the beginning of his career, which is rare among the athletes of our  time.
    <br>People thought he was just confessing Jesus like any one of us today.
    <br>People believed he was just confessing Jesus like any one of us today,
    <br>but the manifestation of the belief in his heart happened
    <br>because he confessed what he believed.
    <br>He confessed what he believed and the manifestation of the Spirit happened
    <br>and immediately he gave glory to Jesus.
    <br>Let us watch.
    <br>... to do what you just did. You said it, you called it and you made it happen.
    <br>You know, first and foremost, I want to say thank You to my Lord who saved me: Jesus Christ.
    <br>I said those who bring evil against me will not prosper.
    <br>I said those who stand in the dark can never come into the light.
    <br>All praise be to the One and only true God Jesus Christ.
    <br>You have seen the manifestation of his belief.
    <br>But today our belief is of our mouth, not in our heart.
    <br>When we see a person that we call a Christian because of his confession
    <br>or sometimes his doings,
    <br>when you see his heart, you will know that he is not a Christian.
    <br>Why?
    <br>He has no control of his heart.
    <br>You cannot see him lying, you cannot see him smoking,
    <br>you cannot see him drinking but his heart is smoking,
    <br>his heart is drinking, his heart is holding grudges.
    <br>Today people call us Christians because no one can read the heart.
    <br>Who knows the heart?
    <br>Only God Almighty knows the heart.
    <br>Therefore, be careful of good-intentioned people giving advice from the natural.
    <br>"This man is good, fine, kind."
    <br>Don't forget:
    <br>One can be kind, one can be loving, one can be faithful,
    <br>but the consistency of it is what we call Christian.
    <br>Let someone say, "The evidence of genuineness is constancy".
    <br>When you say, "I am a child of God",
    <br>when someone says, "I am a child of God, I am a Christian, I am a good man",
    <br>what he is doing now, the consistency of it - I mean, how long, how far
    <br>in the face of temptation, trials, tribulation -
    <br>will determine whether he is a believer or not.
    <br>God looks at the heart.
    <br>He is not looking at love now but love in fifteen years, love in thirty years, love forever;
    <br>not faithfulness now but faithfulness in five years, ten years, faithfulness forever.
    <br>But today: Love today; hate tomorrow.
    <br>Faithfulness today; unfaithfulness tomorrow.
    <br>Don't forget how many times you rise and fall.
    <br>We fall and keep claiming that we rise as a child of God.
    <br>But remember:
    <br>The Scripture says in 1 Thessalonians 5:2 that Jesus is coming like a thief in the night -
    <br>you can never know when that time shall be.
    <br>Jesus is coming like a thief in the night.
    <br>Who knows when and how?
    <br>When He comes, He may find you as a child of God or when you are not a child of God.
    <br>Who knows when He comes?
    <br>It may be when you are in line with Him
    <br>or when you are not in line with Him.
    <br>Will you be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>Finally, brethren:
    <br>Christianity is not an issue of boasting.
    <br>You can only boast about what you are doing, not on what God is doing.
    <br>Being a child of God is the Lord's doing.
    <br>Let someone say, "The Lord's doing".
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do, is not claiming God's promises alone
    <br>but the relationship we maintain and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.
    <br>There is atmosphere and there is an atmosphere.
    <br>The right relationship produces the right atmosphere.
    <br>God is waiting for everyone at the point of His Spirit.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit that helps us create an atmosphere of belief,
    <br>create an atmosphere of love, faith, faithfulness, kindness - the fruit of the Spirit.
    <br>This message is challenging you and me today to seek first the Kingdom of God
    <br>and His righteousness and every other thing shall be given to you.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>That Manna I told you about this morning, before this meeting,
    <br>today, if you believe, you will taste it.
    <br>Say, "I will taste it!"
    <br>When Jesus becomes your Coach, you will begin to see what has not yet been seen,
    <br>you will begin to describe the taste of honey while you are still in tears
    <br>because the Lord has done it.
    <br>Let someone say, "The Lord has done it."
    <br>What is the way out?
    <br>Only believe.
    <br>Say, "Only believe".
    <br>Say, "Lord, I believe; help me overcome my unbelief."
    <br>May God bless His Word, in Jesus' name.
