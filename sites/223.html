    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>Madam, how are you?
    <br>What happened to you and your man?
    <br>We are quarrelling.
    <br>You can't just leave, because of your children.
    <br>Go and wait for me.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Mrs Stella Mebawondun.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>The man of God gave us a prophecy last Sunday.
    <br>He said that my husband and I are quarrelling.
    <br>I said, "Yes."
    <br>The prophecy is true.
    <br>I caught my husband one day with another woman.
    <br>When I came home from the church, I found condoms on the floor.
    <br>That is why we are quarrelling.
    <br>- OK, you found condoms on the floor?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Plenty of them?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Was there plenty of them?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Oh no. Clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Imagine a man of God coming towards you and saying, "Don't leave your house. You are planning to leave.
    <br>Because of your children, please, don't leave your house. This is divorce.
    <br>Something happened between you and your husband. No, don't leave."
    <br>And she was planning to leave. What about the children?
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Those issues are more than enough evidence to separate the marriage.
    <br>So, let's hear from the man.
    <br>"I Found My Husband's Condoms!!!"
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING
    <br>You have not finished talking ...
    <br>Man of God, deliver my husband. My husband is a womanizer.
    <br>I am 57 years old.
    <br>- You mean we should deliver your husband?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- He likes what?
    <br>- He likes women.
    <br>"I Found My Husband's Condoms!!!"
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING
    <br>Let's hear from our father.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr Mebawondun Elisha Omobule.
    <br>I am from Ondo State.
    <br>I am residing in Lagos here.
    <br>I married my wife almost 40 years ago.
    <br>We have been living together.
    <br>She has been very instrumental to anything I have attained in life.
    <br>It got to a certain time, about two and a half years ago,
    <br>my madam told me that since she had entered menopause,
    <br>she would never come close to me again and we would no longer do anything in common.
    <br>Why?
    <br>She said meeting a man would cause her tummy to protrude, according to what people told her.
    <br>Since he womanizes, I don't want him to give me a sickness.
    <br>You are just talking now.
    <br>Mama said it is not an issue of menopause.
    <br>But because the man is a womanizer, she doesn't want to get any sickness from him.
    <br>She wants to live a long life.
    <br>She doesn't want this man to contract a disease.
    <br>What do you want to say?
    <br>That was what she told me.
    <br>They can lie to you, but they cannot lie to God.
    <br>She said she found condoms in your place and found you with many women.
    <br>She didn't find any condom in my house.
    <br>But she says she found you with a woman.
    <br>Whatever she is saying, she is relying on hearsay - what people told her.
    <br>She has never caught me with a woman.
    <br>It was true that you found condoms?
    <br>That very day, when I came home from church, he had intended to throw the condom in the dustbin
    <br>but it dropped on the floor and I saw it.
    <br>OK.
    <br>What does God say about this?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>I think baba needs to be delivered.
    <br>It is true - what mama is saying about baba.
    <br>Baba just needs to be delivered.
    <br>After the deliverance they will live as husband and wife.
    <br>"I Found My Husband's Condoms!!!"
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING
    <br>So this issue will not separate the marriage at this age - marriage of forty something years.
    <br>There is a limit to human endurance.
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul said that it is good for man not to touch a woman
    <br>but because of adultery, fornication and promiscuity, everyone must have his own wife.
    <br>The wife has no authority over her body.
    <br>What baba is saying now is that my mummy pushed him outside.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Aha!
    <br>Give me your hand.
    <br>- So, she pushed you outside?
    <br>- She pushed me outside.
    <br>OK, it is alright. She will not push you outside again.
    <br>She pushed me outside.
    <br>- She pushed you outside?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>"I Found My Husband's Condoms!!!"
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING
    <br>OK. Let's go.
