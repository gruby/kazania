  <p>    
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>WE ARE A TEAM | Full Message | T.B. Joshua
    <br>We are not alone.
    <br>When you say you are not alone, you are talking of your neighbour who is with you.
    <br>Or what are you talking about?
    <br>You mean you see beyond your neighbour?
    <br>You can see those who are with us?
    <br>If you can see those who are with us, let me see your hands.
    <br>Fighting for us.
    <br>Those who are with us, supporting us, if you can see them, let me see you hands.
    <br>Those who are with you here, fighting for you and defending you,
    <br>if you can see them, let me see your hands.
    <br>Where are they?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am justified.
    <br>I am no longer condemned.
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past".
    <br>Let me see your hands.
    <br>WE ARE A TEAM | Full Message | T.B. Joshua
    <br>We are not alone.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I know you have been fed with the milk of the Word, the essentials,
    <br>not the meat of the Word to make you strong.
    <br>I mean the milk.
    <br>There is a difference between milk and meat.
    <br>You know the work of milk and you know the work of meat.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>I don't mean milk or meat to what you are used to.
    <br>You have been fed with the milk of the Word, the essentials,
    <br>not the meat of the Word to make you strong.
    <br>I think this is the trouble between the people that were saying,
    <br>"I am for Paul" and "I am for Apollos".
    <br>Some in the church were proclaiming, "I am for Paul";
    <br>others were yelling, "I am for Apollos".
    <br>But when you ask God, "Who is Paul? Who is Apollos?"...
    <br>When you read your Bible 1 Corinthians 3:1-23, you will see clearly.
    <br>The Lord says there,
    <br>'My servants preached the Word to motivate people to faith.'
    <br>The real servant of God preached the Word to motivate people to faith.
    <br>In a different way, they ministered because they were given different spiritual gifts.
    <br>Some would not talk; mere breathing - the healing,
    <br>while some needed to say, "Be healed!"
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>WE ARE A TEAM | Full Message | T.B. Joshua
    <br>What was coming out of them healed people;
    <br>they said, "He doesn't call the name 'Jesus'".
    <br>While some would say, "In the name of Jesus, be healed! Come back tomorrow."
    <br>The following day, "In the name of Jesus..."
    <br>After 3 days you get healed.
    <br>While some, "In the name of Jesus, be healed!", and he is healed there.
    <br>You know what the Bible says,
    <br>whether you plant or water, we are a team.
    <br>Each will be rewarded for what he or she does
    <br>because we are all Christ's co-workers.
    <br>The one that says, "In the name of Jesus, be healed!", and the person still feels the pain,
    <br>maybe he will say, "Come back tomorrow".
    <br>The following day again, "Be healed!"
    <br>- "Pastor, I'm still feeling the pain."
    <br>- "Don't worry. Fast for 3 days."
    <br>You fast for 3 days; he says, "Come back".
    <br>On the third day, "Be healed!"
    <br>"Pastor, I'm getting better."
    <br>And also the pastor that says, "In the name of Jesus, be healed!" and he is healed instantly.
    <br>We are a team.
    <br>WE ARE A TEAM | Full Message | T.B. Joshua
    <br>You have been to many places where they may ask you to fast for 30 days and you are sick.
    <br>Maybe at the end of 30 days you will feel better but it motivated your faith.
    <br>If they ask you to fast - that is motivation.
    <br>We are given different spiritual gifts.
    <br>That is why our ministrations are different.
    <br>Because we have different spiritual gifts, that is why our ministrations are different.
    <br>We are all Christ's co-workers.
    <br>One thing is sure, the foundation has already been laid.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>For no one can lay the foundation because the foundation has already been laid.
    <br>The foundation is Jesus Christ.
    <br>WE ARE A TEAM | Full Message | T.B. Joshua
    <br>I must be careful how I work because the foundation has already been laid.
    <br>No one can lay the foundation; the foundation is Jesus.
    <br>I will build on the foundation of Jesus Christ.
    <br>WE ARE A TEAM | Full Message | T.B. Joshua
    <br>I talked of milk and meat.
    <br>I believe you have been fed with the milk of the Word, the essentials.
    <br>That milk renews our strength and the meat refreshes our mind.
    <br>The milk renews our strength while the meat refreshes our mind.
    <br>Some in the church, even today, will say, "I am for Paul" - and who is Paul?
    <br>Others will say, "I am for Apollos" - and who is Apollos?
    <br>But stated clearly this way:
    <br>The servant of God preaches the Word and motivates people to faith.
    <br>Their ministrations are different because they were given different spiritual gifts.
    <br>Like I have said to you, some may not bother to touch you,
    <br>they will just stretch their hand from a distance and you will feel the presence of God.
    <br>That is the restoration power.
    <br>You know what I mean by 'restoration power'?
    <br>Heat - you will feel lightening around you.
    <br>You know lightening - when it is about to rain, you hear...
    <br>You will feel the lightening from the hand stretched from a distance.
    <br>While others have to touch and touch before you feel.
    <br>Whether you plant or water, we are a team.
    <br>The one that touches so that the gentleman feels the presence - he also motivates people to faith.
    <br>The one at a distance, instantly also motivates people to faith.
    <br>We are a team.
    <br>Until the church knows this, we will not stop being envious and jealous of ourselves.
    <br>You will surrender, accept and say, "Thank You, Jesus"
    <br>for the blessing God has given you.
    <br>Each will be rewarded for what he or she does
    <br>because we are all Christ's co-workers.
    <br>For no one can lay the foundation because it has already been laid.
    <br>The foundation is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I will build on the foundation of Jesus Christ".
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>You cannot lay the foundation; the foundation has already been laid.
    <br>If the church knows this today, you would not fight for God; God would fight for you.
    <br>Because the house you are talking about, you cannot lay the foundation.
    <br>You are only building on the foundation that has already been built.
    <br>The way the church is going today...
    <br>We are behaving and acting as if we can lay the foundation.
    <br>That is why we can judge in the church.
    <br>That is why we can begin to measure ourselves by ourselves
    <br>and compare ourselves with others.
    <br>That is why we stand to say, "That religion is bad, that is good".
    <br>It is only the foundation, Jesus Christ that has the right to do that.
    <br>We will talk and He makes it happen.
    <br>We cannot make our words happen; we can only talk and He makes it happen.
    <br>The Word we speak is not ours.
    <br>It goes beyond us.
    <br>I will not see you because we are not operating
    <br>with the same spiritual level or gifts and begin to compare myself.
    <br>I will look to the Source of that gift, not you, no matter what you possess
    <br>or the gift of God you have.
    <br>I will look to the Source of that gift instead of you.
    <br>Whatever you possess or the gift of God you have,
    <br>what matters is the maintenance of that gift.
    <br>If you possess all the spiritual gifts of God and you are at the deepest side...
    <br>There are three levels for us - deep, deeper and deepest.
    <br>We ministers of God all over the world are placed into three categories -
    <br>deep, deeper and deepest; that is our relationship.
    <br>God is there and you are either in the deep, deeper or deepest.
    <br>This is why, what I can see, others may not see it
    <br>and what others can see, I may not see it.
    <br>This is where the trouble comes in.
    <br>When I know there are three stages for us, and others see something and I cannot see it,
    <br>I should surrender.
    <br>I should not say, "This man is not from God".
    <br>If I'm at the deep side, and someone is at deeper, he should be able to see clear,
    <br>the vision should be clearer than mine, he should be able to understand God better than me.
    <br>He should be able to see the insight better than me.
    <br>If I'm at the deeper site and someone is at the deepest side and he is talking about God,
    <br>I should surrender because he sees clearer than me.
    <br>That is the position of church and us, servants of God, all over.
    <br>The earlier the better you know where you belong
    <br>because there is a time for everything.
    <br>If you don't know where you belong now and later you get to know
    <br>and you want to reconcile yourself and do the right thing, you may not be able to
    <br>because of your age in the ministry.
    <br>We are a team.
    <br>Whether you plant or water, we are a team.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>Whether you stand at a distance and say, "In the name of Jesus!" and the person receives healing,
    <br>and the one also who went there to touch, "Be healed" - the person is not healed,
    <br>"Come back tomorrow. Go and fast for 4 days, 4 nights", and after fasting, no healing,
    <br>another day again, "Be healed!", or they call prayer warriors to surround you and pray -
    <br>all to motivate you to faith.
    <br>We are a team.
    <br>WE ARE A TEAM | Full Message | T.B. Joshua
    <br>One thing is clear, we are all Christ's co-workers.
    <br>For no one can build a foundation because the foundation has already been laid.
    <br>The foundation is Jesus Christ; I will build on the foundation of Jesus Christ.
    <br>What are we fighting for when you cannot build the foundation?
    <br>"This man is not good..." and begin to fight - no, what are we fighting for?
    <br>What are we dragging?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What are we dragging, when you are not the foundation?"
    <br>WE ARE A TEAM | Full Message | T.B. Joshua
    <br>"I'm for Paul. I'm for Apollos" - but what does this mean?
    <br>It means that we minister differently because we were given different spiritual gifts.
    <br>One thing is clear - for no one can build the foundation
    <br>because the foundation has been already been laid; the foundation is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I will build on the foundation of Jesus Christ".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[I will build on the foundation of Jesus Christ.]
    <br>Again
    <br>[I will build on the foundation of Jesus Christ.]
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Bless you.
