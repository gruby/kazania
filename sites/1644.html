  <p>    
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Good Morning to you in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come and wave your hand and say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Come and wave your hand and thank Him for His mercy.
    <br>Thank Him for His favour.
    <br>Thank Him for His compassion.
    <br>Thank Him for His unlimited grace in your life.
    <br>Thank Him.
    <br>They are new every morning, in Jesus' name.
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let someone say, "I am in the presence of God to receive from Him.
    <br>I am at the feet of Jesus Christ to learn from Him."
    <br>Are you sure?
    <br>Get ready to make His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Is your soul worried?
    <br>Do you feel like your faith is fainting?
    <br>Brethren, I want to assure you
    <br>that your life will run smoothly if you go by the way of the Cross.
    <br>The Bible says the Word of God is the Chronicle of God's love for His people
    <br>from darkness before Eden to eternity.
    <br>You are in it, I am in it but most importantly, God is in it.
    <br>This is the plan of God for you and me, the world and eternity.
    <br>Can you raise your Bible?
    <br>Raise your Bible.
    <br>Say, "This is the plan of God for me, the world and eternity."
    <br>In the Book of Hebrews 12:1, the Bible advises us to strip off all weight
    <br>that may slow us down from running the straight race with God.
    <br>Those worries, anxiety, cares and burdens...
    <br>Today many invest heavily on activities meant to prolong life and improve physical condition
    <br>but they spend little or no time on enhancing their spiritual life.
    <br>Many today invest heavily on activities meant to prolong life and improve physical condition
    <br>but they spend little or no time on enhancing their spiritual life.
    <br>How short-sighted it is to work so hard to improve this life and take no time to prepare for eternity.
    <br>Think about this.
    <br>How short-sighted it is to work hard to extend this life and not take time to prepare for eternity.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the Book of Luke 18:22 when Jesus advised the young rich man to sell all his possessions
    <br>and give the money to the poor so he could have treasure in Heaven,
    <br>Jesus was simply telling him to get rid of anything
    <br>that had become more important to his life than God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The same message Jesus has for all of us.
    <br>The same message Jesus has for you and I today, brethren, viewers all over the world.
    <br>We must get rid of anything that has become more significant to our lives
    <br>than our spiritual essence, God.
    <br>In the usual worry about what tomorrow might bring,
    <br>many have become useful instruments in the hands of satan, without even being aware of it.
    <br>You know, we are getting to the end of the year, the most sensitive and delicate time.
    <br>Let us learn from Christ Jesus to always be at God's finding rather than our own
    <br>and not to take any irregular course, irregular path, irregular way for our supply
    <br>when our wants are ever pressing.
    <br>God knows all you need.
    <br>Although He may not necessarily give us all we want,
    <br>the Bible says He will give us all we need because human wants are unlimited.
    <br>And this brings me to the title of this message for you this morning:
    <br>SLOW DOWN AND CARE FOR YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Slow down and care for your spiritual life."
    <br>Our spiritual life is the engine that carries all our possessions and flourishes them.
    <br>No matter how we live, life is too short to waste
    <br>on things that have no lasting value or lasting significance.
    <br>It is important for us to deal with undisciplined areas in our lives.
    <br>You know the areas of your life that are undisciplined.
    <br>Look at your neighbour and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>there is something far more important than your present situation."
    <br>Let's open our Bibles quickly to the Book of Matthew
    <br>and let's take the reading from verse 6.
    <br>Let someone say, "Slow down and care for your spiritual life."
    <br>Say, "Slow down and care for your spiritual life."
    <br>The Book of Matthew 6 from verse 19.
    <br>"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth,
    <br>where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal;
    <br>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
    <br>where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.
    <br>For your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
    <br>Now, let's go straight to verse 33.
    <br>"But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness,
    <br>and all these things shall be added to you."
    <br>From that Matthew 6 from verse 9 to the end,
    <br>I personally have come to realise that
    <br>what we treasure the most controls our life, whether we like it or not.
    <br>What we treasure the most controls us, whether we like it or not.
    <br>It is important to know that fleshly desires and spiritual desires are parallel lines;
    <br>they are diametric opposites.
    <br>No one can serve two masters with equal concentration and equal loyalty.
    <br>Remember, both masters want us to run a straight race with them.
    <br>'Fleshly desires' are our needs whilst spiritual desires represent eternity.
    <br>Jesus knows that we need those fleshly comforts to live for Him
    <br>but He would rather ask us to first seek the Kingdom of God and all His righteousness -
    <br>every other thing will follow.
    <br>Today many choose to live in a 'descending order',
    <br>rather than an 'ascending order'.
    <br>Instead of starting from 1 to 2 and to 3,
    <br>many choose to begin with 3 before regressing to 2 and to 1.
    <br>The Bible says that he who neglects the present for the future
    <br>is acting opposite to the order of God and sound wisdom.
    <br>Many today choose to focus so much on their situation,
    <br>neglecting the importance of living each day as if it were our last.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>By leaving your tomorrow's trouble to the One who bore our troubles on the Cross.
    <br>Ask yourself: How much loyalty do you give to the One who gives value to your life?
    <br>How much concentration do you give to the One who gives value to your life?
    <br>Ask yourself: How much attention do you give to the One who gives value to your life?
    <br>Remember God knows our challenges and He gives us enough grace to face each trial.
    <br>Let someone say, "Slow down and care for your spiritual life."
    <br>Many today are confined within a tiny slice of life.
    <br>Remember when your focus is only on making money, acquiring wealth, gaining popularity,
    <br>a large slice of life will pass you by.
    <br>It is very tempting to use good health, wealth, position, power and prestige to measure your life.
    <br>However, on God's scales, they are lighter than a puff of air, a breath of air.
    <br>Don't forget that the glory of the world is the most charming temptation to the carnally minded.
    <br>Many people are seeking a breakthrough, new relationship, new dream, new goal,
    <br>but I want you to know this morning that the glory of the world
    <br>is the most charming temptation to the carnally minded, and the life that carries it.
    <br>Whenever you are experiencing a 'down time' in life -
    <br>perhaps in your health, your relationship, your finances, your career -
    <br>it is an opportunity to slow down and care for your spiritual life.
    <br>You must understand that there is something wrong somewhere.
    <br>Whenever you are experiencing a 'down time' in life -
    <br>perhaps your dream, your vision, your marriage, your career, your destiny, even your health -
    <br>it is important for you to slow down and care for your spiritual life.
    <br>Are you young or old?
    <br>Are you rich or poor?
    <br>Are you sick or healthy?
    <br>It is never too late for you to slow down and care for your spiritual life.
    <br>If you are waiting for a more convenient time to do this, that time may never come.
    <br>Let someone say, "Slow down and care for your spiritual life."
    <br>Are you discouraged because of what life brings?
    <br>Remember, the cure for discouragement is to learn to leave all trouble
    <br>for the One who bore our troubles on the Cross.
    <br>Many would ask:
    <br>Why do these people keep talking about situations as if they are easy to face?
    <br>They keep talking about situations as if situations are easy to face.
    <br>Of course, we know how hard it can get,
    <br>but one thing Prophet T.B. Joshua made us to understand:
    <br>Unpleasant situations are not meant to stay; they will surely go if you take the right course.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Unpleasant situations are not meant to stay; they will surely go if you take the right course."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where there is a will, there is a way out.
    <br>Where there is a will, a determination, there is a way out.
    <br>Today the way out for you has come, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I don't care what the statistics say about you but if you can follow this instruction in righteousness,
    <br>I tell you the way out for you has come, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Where there is a will, a determination, there is always a way out."
    <br>Are you frightened by what your situation has to say?
    <br>Remember, when you are anxious about your situation,
    <br>you will not be able to differentiate between God's supply and satan's bait
    <br>in the face of certain trying situations.
    <br>That is why when satan gives something with the right hand -
    <br>something that apparently looks like peace with his right hand -
    <br>he takes from you what your life depends on with the left hand.
    <br>We have listened to so many testimonies of those whom satan gave peace,
    <br>things that apparently look like peace
    <br>but at the end of the day, he takes from them what their lives depend on with the left hand.
    <br>And that is why Jesus says in John 14:27, "I do not give peace as the world gives."
    <br>The peace of Christ is infinitely more valuable than that of the world.
    <br>The peace of the world is time-bound while the peace of Christ is for eternity.
    <br>The joy, the peace, the comfort that you enjoy
    <br>depend on where your breakthrough comes from.
    <br>Let us learn from Zacchaeus in the Book of Luke 19:9 -
    <br>a man who spent his entire life pursuing things that had no lasting value
    <br>until he understood the meaning of life and he reached out to Jesus
    <br>and salvation came to his house.
    <br>You just have to experience God.
    <br>Until we experience God, there will be dissatisfaction in our lives -
    <br>I mean a sense of hunger to know what life is all about,
    <br>a desire to know what happens after life is over.
    <br>You just have to experience God.
    <br>This is what I have learned from my father in the Lord, my mentor, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to desire God first and every other thing will follow.
    <br>Let someone say, "Slow down and care for your spiritual life."
    <br>Finally brethren, let's turn our Bibles to the Book of Romans 8:1
    <br>and let us take this home.
    <br>"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,
    <br>who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."
    <br>Let's take verses 5 and 6 together.
    <br>"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh,
    <br>but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
    <br>For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."
    <br>Can I hear you?
    <br>... is life and?
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>"How foolish it is to care for our needs and not to have a rich relationship with God".
    <br>How foolish it is for me to care for my needs and not to have a rich relationship with God.
    <br>What does this mean to you?
    <br>We care so much about our needs
    <br>but how much do we care about our spiritual life, our relationship with God?
    <br>Remember, the blessings of the world enrich the body temporarily,
    <br>while the blessings of Christ enrich the soul for eternity.
    <br>In other words, when you care for your spiritual life, you will see yourself the way God sees you.
    <br>Only then will you be dead to what your situation has to say and be alive in Christ Jesus.
    <br>As we approach the New Year, make a decision today whom to run your race for.
    <br>Are you going to keep running for fleshly desires or spiritual desires?
    <br>Remember, those who put their trust in Christ Jesus
    <br>shall find Him to be all-sufficient and their happiness shall remain permanent.
    <br>Let us live for eternity and we shall secure all that is available in it.
    <br>Salvation is available, prosperity is available,
    <br>good health is available, direction and freedom are available
    <br>if you can begin today to care for your spiritual life.
    <br>This is the message for you today.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of your heart, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let someone say,
    <br>"There is something far more important than my present situation - my spiritual life."
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
