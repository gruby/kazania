    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Can you tell us the meaning of that song
    <br>so that you will now sing it; I too, I want to dance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People were doing like this.
    <br>What is that?
    <br>It is Chukwu Na - God of the Heavens.
    <br>- God of the Heavens?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Sing it.
    <br>If it is God of the Heavens.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Are you ready to shout the name of the God of the Heavens and the earth?

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>I'm going to learn the song.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is a voice that was repeatedly, continuously put in my heart.
    <br>The Lord said I should say to you,
    <br>"What you have been going through will soon be a memory".
    <br>Yes. Write it down.
    <br>You know we are going through the end of the year.
    <br>What you have been going through will soon be a memory; it will be part of your history.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Your future is being fashioned at this time.
    <br>Write it down.
    <br>Your future is being fashioned at this time.
    <br>You may look at the way things are going with you.
    <br>All you need to do now - just take my word.
    <br>It's not from me - it's from above.
    <br>What will you say in the future about now?
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>What will I say in the future about now?
    <br>You have to sit down and begin to think, "Oh, this is what I went through.
    <br>This is what happened to me". Don't forget.
    <br>What will I say in the future about now?
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[What will I say in the future about now?]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[What will I say in the future about now?]
    <br>What will you say in the future about now?
    <br>When we say now - where you are coming from before coming here,
    <br>your past, what you have gone through and all that.
    <br>It will definitely come.
    <br>It is a prophetic word for your life.
    <br>Begin to think, write it down.
    <br>What will I say in the future about now?
    <br>Those pains, afflictions, hardships, embarrassments will soon be...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>It depends on your perspective, the way you look at things.
    <br>You look at T.B. Joshua - "he is a man, he is talking to me, he is lecturing."
    <br>I'm not a lecturer; I'm just telling you the message from above.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have found my own path - all because I see things differently.
    <br>It's not the way you look at things that I look at things.
    <br>I believe in God's authority, not people's majority.
    <br>See things differently.
    <br>That is why hardly you will say, "T.B. Joshua is at this occasion,
    <br>I found him at the party, I found him there".
    <br>I see things differently.
    <br>When you come through the valley of the shadow of death, you are different people -
    <br>wise, stronger and better people.
    <br>Remember what the Psalm 119:71 says:
    <br>"It was good for me to be afflicted so that I may learn the decrees of God."
    <br>Rejoice when you are going through trials and welcome trials as friends. 
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Open your lips right now and begin to release yourself.
    <br>If there is anyone in our midst or there is anything that is still holding you back,
    <br>right now, it is time to release yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>That thing that is still holding you back -
    <br>maybe your faith wants to see enough before coming to believe.
    <br>Now you have seen enough.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever is caused by you and evil spirits - out!
    <br>I present you before the Lord - be sanctified!
    <br>I present you before the Lord - be declared free!
    <br>I present you before the Lord - be healed!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>If there is anyone in our midst that is still holding back - be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and voice out your pain; voice out your complaints.
    <br>Voice it out.
    <br>We look differently, we see differently, we receive differently, we deliver differently.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Voice out.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I deliver you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Jesus is looking at your heart because your heart is the contact point.
    <br>Your heart is the link.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Jesus is looking at your heart.
    <br>How you look, your appearance, does not matter.
    <br>He is looking at your heart because your heart is the link.
    <br>Pray with all your heart.
    <br>Voice with all your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
