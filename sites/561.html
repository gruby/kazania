  <p>    
    <br>My name is Philomina Sunday. I am a widow.
    <br>I am a mother of nine children.
    <br>I have been suffering, begging for food to eat. Nobody will assist me.
    <br>I started going to dustbins to pick food to eat.
    <br>Even the clothes that I am wearing, I picked them from the dustbin, washed them to wear.
    <br>Even for my children, I will pick clothes from the dustbin and wash them for them to wear.
    <br>If we don't go to the dustbin early, we will not find food to eat.
    <br>When we go there early, we will find food to pick there.
    <br>Sometimes when we go there, we will find some foods like yam, corn, bread and groundnut.
    <br>We will pick all of those things there.
    <br>Things have been very difficult for me.
    <br>There was a woman who saw me at the dustbin.
    <br>She asked what I was doing at the dustbin with these children, picking food every day.
    <br>I said there was nobody to help me.
    <br>I have been suffering. If I go to people to give me money, they will disappoint me.
    <br>My boyfriend - I was thinking that he was going to help me and my children,
    <br>to send them to school. But the man disappointed me. He could not do it.
    <br>I told the woman that this is where I get food to eat.
    <br>She then asked me if I knew about The SCOAN. I said, "No".
    <br>She said she would help me.
    <br>I asked her how was she going to help me get to The SCOAN
    <br>because I didn't know anybody there.
    <br>The woman told me that I should not worry.
    <br>There was a day we went to a dustbin.
    <br>We were collecting food and cans.
    <br>We would sell the cans for 50 naira and use the money to buy food to eat.
    <br>The woman then came to me and told me that we should prepare now.
    <br>The woman chartered a bus and put us on it.
    <br>She said that if I wanted the man of God to really believe that I am suffering,
    <br>I should give the man of God this cassette and he should watch it
    <br>to see how I am suffering.
    <br>The woman gave me the cassette that I should take it to The SCOAN,
    <br>that the man of God would help me.
    <br>Let us watch the video.
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>Is that where you live?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>This is where you sleep?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>No matter your level in life, you are a solution to a problem.
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>He died in 2004, on the 18th of August.
    <br>Where is the senior one?
    <br>The senior daughter is here.
    <br>She has married?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>My Name is Abumare Faith.
    <br>What my mother is saying is true.
    <br>Because of the suffering, I saw a man that said he was going to keep me in his house.
    <br>I didn't know the man was suffering. I have two children from him.
    <br>He doesn't have any work.
    <br>The clothes I am wearing are from the dustbin.
    <br>My mum came one day and told us that she had something to tell us.
    <br>She said that a woman told her to go to The SCOAN.
    <br>I know that as we have come here, our story will turn around.
    <br>Whatever we want to do to restore this family, let them be part of our family.
    <br>We will counsel them so that these children will not be destroyed.
    <br>She has no reason for getting married but because of problems.
    <br>That is what she is saying.
    <br>They have to get accommodation. These children have to go to school.
    <br>They will go for deliverance now.
    <br>That poverty is not just poverty
    <br>but it has become a curse and Jesus can remove this curse.
    <br>All over the world. People like this - they are everywhere.
    <br>Please find them, help them and restore them.
    <br>Don't just pass by and close your eyes.
    <br>What can we do? Let us put an end to this.
    <br>First, we want to give her 500,000 naira.
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>They can give them 10 bags of rice.
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>They will stay in the church until we get them a house.
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>My name is Anthonia.
    <br>I thank the man of God for what he has done for us.
    <br>Since my mother has been suffering, I saw a man that said he liked me.
    <br>He made me pregnant.
    <br>After I gave birth to my baby, I found out that the man at times has a mental problem.
    <br>This June, the mental problem started.
    <br>Sometimes he will start behaving strangely outside.
    <br>People will start running away.
    <br>He used to beat me and my baby. Sometimes he will kick us out.
    <br>My mother doesn't have anything.
    <br>If I go to her, she doesn't have anything to give me.
    <br>She doesn't have any place to keep me and my baby.
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>That marriage should be immediately terminated.
    <br>It is a wrong marriage, caused by poverty. Your future first before marriage.
    <br>Let them face their career and future.
    <br>If the Lord says they will marry tomorrow, they can marry tomorrow.
    <br>But that marriage should be stopped for now.
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>What a beautiful girl! Look at this one.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>Esther.
    <br>Wow - look!
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>Look at the face!
    <br>Man of God, I have something to tell you.
    <br>I am thanking you for removing me from poverty to riches today.
    <br>I am thanking you for all the good things you have done for me.
    <br>You will live long!
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>The opposite is the case now. I am to thank you for receiving this gift.
    <br>Thank you for receiving this gift.
    <br>You will live long!
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Philomina Sunday. I am a widow.
    <br>I am 42 years old.
    <br>I am from Kogi State (Nigeria).
    <br>These are my children and grandchildren.
    <br>My husband died 5 years ago.
    <br>Since then, things have been difficult for me.
    <br>I have been suffering, begging for food, going to dustbins to pick food to eat with my children.
    <br>I thank God today that my case is over.
    <br>My husband was a very big man.
    <br>When I complained to him that I wanted to start a business,
    <br>he asked me what type of business I wanted to start.
    <br>I told him that I wanted to sell cows.
    <br>He gave me the money to start the business.
    <br>We were living fine and rich.
    <br>When my husband had an accident and broke his ribs,
    <br>I was taking him to different hospitals, spending money.
    <br>He then told me that the money is finished.
    <br>He said he was going back to his village.
    <br>We prepared to go to his village.
    <br>He sent me to bring a document,
    <br>telling me that I should not return on Monday but on Friday.
    <br>I asked him why he asked me to return on Friday.
    <br>He said it was so that he could prepare our property in the house.
    <br>I said okay.
    <br>I then went to Asaba.
    <br>On Thursday, I called Anthonia's phone number; it wasn't going through.
    <br>I was calling her daddy's number but it was also not going through.
    <br>So, I had to call my husband's cousin.
    <br>That was on Friday morning. I was feeling cold all over me.
    <br>I could not get myself.
    <br>He then told me that my husband had died.
    <br>I asked what had killed him.
    <br>He said double cross your heart and start coming,
    <br>do not to call any of your family to come. I said no;
    <br>I had to go and call my parents and my uncle. They followed me to that place.
    <br>My husband died on August 18th, that was on Thursday at 6 o'clock.
    <br>They buried him at 12 o'clock, midnight.
    <br>They didn't allow me to see the corpse. There were a lot of complaints.
    <br>I said, "God, let Your will be done".
    <br>When my husband died, there was no money with us.
    <br>Since then, I have been going to the dustbin to pick food, cans and clothes.
    <br>I sold the cans to get money.
    <br>To eat once in a day was difficult.
    <br>That is why my daughters fell into that situation, to meet a man to help.
    <br>They got married and had children.
    <br>This is my first daughter and she has three children because of our poverty.
    <br>My second daughter Anthonia has a baby girl from a man.
    <br>The husband has a mental problem.
    <br>The other children are not going to school anymore.
    <br>My name is Anthonia Sunday. This is my baby.
    <br>I thank God for what He has done in our lives,
    <br>for using Prophet T.B. Joshua to bless my family with 500,000 naira and 10 bags of rice.
    <br>We are very happy.
    <br>Now we no longer need to pick food from the dustbin but eat at the dining table.
    <br>God should continue to bless Prophet T.B. Joshua for all that he has done for us.
    <br>After giving Mrs Philomena Sunday and her family the sum of 500,000 naira and 10 bags of rice,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua sent the Emmanuel TV team to look for and rent an accommodation
    <br>that would be suitable for them as they prepare to open a new chapter in their lives.
    <br>This is the accommodation they finally chose.
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>One by one, the Emmanuel TV team enter, carrying different pieces of furniture
    <br>that would transform this new appartment into a comfortable home for the family.
    <br>New furniture, appliances and upholstery are being brought in,
    <br>soon to be arranged so that the family can move in.
    <br>In comes the new mattress and the frame for the bed.
    <br>TRY TO WATCH THIS WITHOUT CRYING!!!
    <br>As a finishing touch, the Emmanuel TV team and Partners purchased two comfortable chairs
    <br>and a coffee table to adorn the sitting room.
    <br>What an amazing contrast!
    <br>A family who was once suffering, living on the streets and eating from dustbins
    <br>is now about to move into a safe, clean, pleasant and comfortable environment.
    <br>What a transformation!
    <br>Glory be to God!
