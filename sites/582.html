  <p>    
    <br>WARNING! The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>A shocking condition brought this man to The SCOAN.
    <br>His body riddled with a lot of sickness.
    <br>Right from the crown of his head, his entire body has been engulfed in a plague,
    <br>shattering his skin into scale-like fragments.
    <br>There is not a hair left on his head as the frightening sickness has completely destroyed the skin.
    <br>From his head, the disease rages across his body, damaging every inch
    <br>and rendering his arms useless.
    <br>The skin flakes and peels horribly all the way down his arms to his fingers.
    <br>Not an inch of his skin has been left unaffected.
    <br>This is a body that cannot lie down, bend or work.
    <br>A once strong and healthy man - now not even a shadow of his former self
    <br>as this debilitating disease has even made menial tasks an unimaginable thought.
    <br>Right down his legs to his feet, the storm of destruction continued with no intermission.
    <br>Much of the skin has been scratched - here exposing the sensitive flesh.
    <br>Some of the broken pieces of his skin can still be seen barely hanging off his hurting body.
    <br>His legs are at places as rough as a tree bark; it is uncomfortable and just as disfigured.
    <br>Even the small movements he makes to turn must be causing him terrible discomfort.
    <br>Demonstrating his fragile state, he touches a piece of his splintered skin which comes off at his hand.
    <br>And you can clearly see that more is ready to fall.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>My name is Jude Oraka. I come from Anambra State (Nigeria).
    <br>I am 39 years old.
    <br>Can you please tell us the problem that brought you to The SCOAN today?
    <br>I have had skin disease for 6 years.
    <br>I cannot sleep; my body itches.
    <br>I cannot walk fine; I feel cold.
    <br>I have general body pain.
    <br>My body used to peel; my skin falls off.
    <br>I have gone to hospitals but the doctors don't have any solution.
    <br>I have gone to native doctors.
    <br>I have taken native medicine but there is no solution.
    <br>I am a driver.
    <br>Since that time, I can't drive; I stay at home.
    <br>So how did you hear about The SCOAN?
    <br>I watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I believe that God will heal me.
    <br>We pray with you that God Almighty will set you free
    <br>from this problem of terrible skin disease in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Watch your screen. That will help your faith.
    <br>Look at the case here.
    <br>It is a mysterious issue.
    <br>I never knew how he came here
    <br>because I don't know the kind of vehicle that would convey this man here.
    <br>So let him get free and go.
    <br>Man of God, please help my brother; he has skin disease for the past six years.
    <br>We have taken him all over; there is no solution.
    <br>Neither herbalist homes or hospitals have provided any solution.
    <br>Man of God, please help my brother. He has skin disease.
    <br>- For how many years? 
    <br>- For six years, sir.
    <br>Ok, let's hear from your brother. What is your problem?
    <br>Can you talk?
    <br>It is skin disease
    <br>Ok, it seems that he cannot talk.
    <br>As you see his appearance, so it is on the inside.
    <br>Both within and inside is like this.
    <br>You will be able to say a word with me?
    <br>Are you ready to accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>I command that disease, that infirmity in your body, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>I command that infirmity out! Begin to vomit it out!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In The Power Of The Holy Spirit
    <br>Out!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In The Power Of The Holy Spirit
    <br>I say, you disease, you can hear me. Come out of this man's life!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, come out!
    <br>You can see what the name of Jesus can do.
    <br>I say, out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>I say out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>It must come out because the name of Jesus is given to cast out demons
    <br>and to speak to disease.
    <br>With the name, we have dominion over all disease, affliction
    <br>infirmity, trouble and the challenges in your life.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>It is poison; he drank poison.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Can you see what I asked you to be patient for?
    <br>An issue like this cannot be handled in the same way I handle your case.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Look here!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, stand up.
    <br>Instantly, the man rises to his feet.
    <br>He's free.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Who is like my Jesus

    <br>The Beginning and the End

    <br>Who is that your Lord
    <br>God is what He says He is
    <br>I don't feel any pain.
    <br>- Are you sure? 
    <br>- I'm sure.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>So right now, the man is alive and he is here now in our midst.
    <br>Please, you are welcome.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>If Jesus Christ could bring Lazarus up from the tomb,
    <br>the power and effectiveness are still the same - yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Our brother is a living testimony.
    <br>Let us put our hands together beautifully for the King of Glory!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Please, let us have our seats.
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Brethren, Good Morning!
    <br>My name is Monica Odey.
    <br>The man beside me is my brother, Jude Oraka.
    <br>We come from Anambra State (Nigeria).
    <br>It all started... He was sick for over six years.
    <br>About two years ago, the sickness developed into chronic skin disease.
    <br>The disease started gradually but spread from the back to the stomach
    <br>to the legs until it affected his entire body, including his head, eyes and ears.
    <br>The problem kept getting worse. We took him to hospitals and herbal homes.
    <br>We took him everywhere! In short, it became a curse.
    <br>If he was coming on the way, people would leave the road.
    <br>We didn't have to ask for an excuse; we were already carrying one by our side.
    <br>Anywhere they saw us coming, people would start running.
    <br>They would ask if it was a ghost or a human being.
    <br>I want to thank God today - I didn't know that Jesus was still alive to bring
    <br>my brother who was dead back to life today.
    <br>We are here to celebrate life and return the glory back to God.
    <br>Last year, it was on July 5th that we came here.
    <br>When we got to the village, his condition became so terrible.
    <br>All of us gathered but nobody could proffer a solution.
    <br>They said the problem was beyond human imagination and understanding.
    <br>The family discussed what to do about it.
    <br>Nobody could offer a solution. At that time, I had just given birth.
    <br>I told them that there is only one man that can do this job - Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Okay. Point of correction.
    <br>Only God Almighty can do it through His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Remember that the man of God says, I am not the Healer but I know the Healer.
    <br>His name is Jesus Christ". All glory be to God!
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>We realised that there was nothing else to do as we had almost given up hope.
    <br>We knew he was a walking corpse, a dead man already
    <br>and any money invested on him was wasted as he had no hope of living.
    <br>I insisted they allow me to travel to Lagos with him to seek the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>They then asked me how he could travel from Anambra to Lagos.
    <br>They said he may likely die on the road but I said that if that happened,
    <br>we would return the corpse back to Makurdi.
    <br>I knew if I just stayed and watched him die, I would not be able to forgive myself.
    <br>I told them to take a step of faith.
    <br>I had a small child with me and they then asked who would travel to Lagos with him.
    <br>They said they didn't know about the church activities, so I said I would go.
    <br>They asked how I would take the man and my baby, considering his skin disease.
    <br>You could not hold him with your bare hands; you had to use a rag to hold him
    <br>because his skin was peeling off.
    <br>I asked my husband if he would allow me to travel with the child and he agreed.
    <br>I said I would go but they said I could not take such a journey alone.
    <br>His wife volunteered to go but said she would not be seen with him in public.
    <br>I said she should not worry as I was ready to bear the shame.
    <br>We took the journey. To dress him up, we put him in four shirts. From up to down.
    <br>We gave him thick socks and tied him with a headtie.
    <br>We gave him a cap and a pair of spectacles to cover his eyes.
    <br>Only the mouth was seen and with that, people were still detecting the problem.
    <br>When we got to the bus park, some people saw him and ran away.
    <br>I spoke to the driver that God wanted to use him to help us take the man
    <br>to The SCOAN in Lagos where God would show forth His mercy.
    <br>The driver agreed on the condition that we would stay at the back of the vehicle
    <br>so that the other passengers would not get distracted by his infirmity.
    <br>I said, "No problem".
    <br>We sat at the back but as the vehicle was moving, pieces of his skin were floating
    <br>inside the vehicle and it became a problem.
    <br>The other passengers became angry with the driver for carrying him,
    <br>"Must you collect money by force? Is it every passenger you see that you must carry?"
    <br>In short, we faced insults and discrace. Our bodies were smelling.
    <br>We kept faith and God brought us from Anambra to The SCOAN; we arrived.
    <br>When we were close to The SCOAN, no vehicle would take us to the church. All of them run away.
    <br>They said they could not carry such.
    <br>When the vehicle dropped us, the driver took a broom
    <br>and swept all the pieces of his skin and threw it away.
    <br>However, we couldn't find any vehicle to take us to the church in Ikotun.
    <br>They said they could not carry a dead man inside their vehicle.
    <br>All the taxis rejected us; we stood for about three hours, begging for help.
    <br>One driver eventually agreed although he charged double the fare.
    <br>I said, "No problem".
    <br>He then took us to Ikotun.
    <br>Upon reaching there, all the hoteliers ran away and denied their lodges.
    <br>Nobody agreed that they had a lodge for him to stay.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Ok, for those who don't understand this part:
    <br>What the woman is trying to say is that
    <br>after all the terrible experience they had, getting to Ikotun where The SCOAN is located...
    <br>Coming down from the bus stop, one would usually have those hoteliers
    <br>running round you for accommodation, "Please come! No, I'm the first person who got this one!"
    <br>"Oya let's go!" They would drag customers.
    <br>But when they saw this man, they all ran away.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>This was not the kind of customer they were looking for.
    <br>Ok, continue.
    <br>All of them ran away and said they didn't need this type of customer.
    <br>We stood at the road for about one hour until we talked to one woman.
    <br>She said she would give us an apartment on one condition.
    <br>I asked her, "What is the condition?"
    <br>- "Double payment." 
    <br>- I said, "No problem. We will pay".
    <br>The woman ushered us to the place.
    <br>Even when we entered the lodge, people staying there started running.
    <br>We were staying in our own private room but they all ran from the compound.
    <br>We give God the glory; the day of the Saturday prayer line came.
    <br>We dressed him in a raincoat and covered all of his body
    <br>because once you saw his body, you would get scared and not come closer.
    <br>Before then, we were going from hospital to hospital.
    <br>Could you imagine a sick person in a hospital waiting to see the doctor
    <br>who saw another sick patient and ran away for fear of contacting the disease?
    <br>Whenever we entered a hospital, all the patients would allow us to go first.
    <br>The doctor would have to come out and ask who brought such a patient.
    <br>When I said I was the one, he asked how I could do such since I had a little child.
    <br>He asked if I had no conscience towards the baby I was carrying.
    <br>I said the man in question was my brother and the child was my baby.
    <br>I said that I knew nothing would happen to the child.
    <br>He told my brother to stay far away from the entrance of the hospital.
    <br>He went to sit on a block outside, not even a chair.
    <br>They had to take their medical equipment outside to attend to him.
    <br>We tried all of this to no avail.
    <br>We came back and on that fateful day, as God may have it...
    <br>If God says your time has not yet come, no matter how the devil will try,
    <br>there will still be a solution.
    <br>This young man could not eat; his whole mouth was bruised.
    <br>The body had pus all over.
    <br>If you sat near him, he would be crying day and night that his body was very hot.
    <br>I asked him how we could help him.
    <br>He said the only assistance we could give  to him was to scratch the body with a broom.
    <br>We would carry a small, strong broom and sweep the body.
    <br>When did this, he would feel a little bit of relief.
    <br>I thank God that when the man of God stretched forth his hand and prayed for him on July 5th,
    <br>from that day, he started getting healed.
    <br>Today, it has become a history and we are here to say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Watch your screen. That will help your faith.
    <br>Look at the case here. It is a mysterious issue.
    <br>I never knew how he came here
    <br>because I don't know the kind of vehicle that would convey this man here.
    <br>So let him get free and go.
    <br>Man of God, please help my brother; he has skin disease for the past six years.
    <br>We have taken him all over; there is no solution.
    <br>Neither herbalist homes or hospitals have provided any solution.
    <br>Man of God, please help my brother. He has skin disease.
    <br>- For how many years? 
    <br>- For six years, sir.
    <br>Ok, let's hear from your brother. What is your problem?
    <br>Can you talk?
    <br>It is skin disease
    <br>Ok, it seems that he cannot talk.
    <br>As you see his appearance, so it is on the inside.
    <br>Both within and inside is like this.
    <br>You will be able to say a word with me?
    <br>Are you ready to accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>I command that disease, that infirmity in your body, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>I command that infirmity out! Begin to vomit it out!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In The Power Of The Holy Spirit
    <br>Out!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer In The Power Of The Holy Spirit
    <br>I say, you disease, you can hear me. Come out of this man's life!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, come out!
    <br>You can see what the name of Jesus can do.
    <br>I say, out!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>I say out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>It must come out because the name of Jesus is given to cast out demons
    <br>and to speak to disease.
    <br>With the name, we have dominion over all disease, affliction
    <br>infirmity, trouble and the challenges in your life.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>It is poison; he drank poison.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Can you see what I asked you to be patient for?
    <br>An issue like this cannot be handled in the same way I handle your case.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Look here!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, stand up.
    <br>Instantly, the man rises to his feet.
    <br>He's free.
    <br>As you can see, indeed, it has become a history
    <br>that he was once suffering from a chronic skin disease.
    <br>Looking at the before and after.
    <br>Wow, God has done a great thing.
    <br>Tell us, all through this period that he was passing through this terrible situation,
    <br>was there any hope?
    <br>Apart from the time you thought of bringing him here?
    <br>We had no hope at all.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>Now that the Lord, God Almighty has set him free,
    <br>you as a sister who had been bearing all the burden, how do you feel?
    <br>I feel very happy; if this is the only mission God gave me the grace to accomlish,
    <br>I am grateful to Him.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, we thank God Almighty for your patience and for being able to stand all this terrible challenge.
    <br>And we believe it wasn't you; it was the Spirit of God.
    <br>If everyone had deserted him, run away from him,
    <br>and you decided to take it upon yourself, even with a month-old baby,
    <br>I think it was the Spirit of God.
    <br>We also thank God for allowing yourself to be used by the Spirit of God
    <br>to bring him to the arena of liberty where he was eventually set free.
    <br>Once again, let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let us hear from the man himself.
    <br>Sir, we can't see the smile on your face.
    <br>Ok. Now tell us your name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Jude Oraka. I'm from Anambra State (Nigeria).
    <br>The person beside me is my lovely sister.
    <br>I want to thank God who used my sister to bring me to The SCOAN.
    <br>The problem I had was a chronic skin disease.
    <br>Can you just explain to us - because it is said, He who feels it knows it -
    <br>what you were experiencing, what was your condition at that time?
    <br>How did you feel in your body when you were having this problem?
    <br>At that time, I felt heat all over my body.
    <br>My body was overheating like a car radiator.
    <br>I could not sit down or stand but only lie down.
    <br>For 24 hours a day, I was lying down on a bed.
    <br>I could not go to the toilet by myself.
    <br>I needed assistance in everything I did.
    <br>And who was doing that?
    <br>My lovely sister was the one helping me.
    <br>I was taken to hospitals and also to a herbalist to get native medicine
    <br>but it was all in vain.
    <br>Everywhere you went, when people saw you, how did they react?
    <br>They felt like a masquerade was coming and ran away.
    <br>Ok. When you now eventually came to The SCOAN,
    <br>the man of God stretched his hand towards you.
    <br>Can you describe to us what happened at the prayer line.
    <br>When I came and saw the man of God, he asked whether I believed in God.
    <br>I said yes.
    <br>He then prophesied that it was a poison and I was going to vomit it.
    <br>He stretched his hand towards me and I began to shake.
    <br>By that time, I was not with myself; I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>I vomitted something.
    <br>From that time, I started recovering.
    <br>And how are you now?
    <br>I'm feeling okay.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Ok, we now want you to pull up the sleeves of the cloth you are wearing.
    <br>Let us see more of your body.
    <br>Also your shoes - let us see the feet that were as rough as the bark of an oak tree then.
    <br>But today you can see that it is as smooth as the skin of a bouncing new-born baby.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>For the glory of God, we want to see your feet because we know how it was when you came.
    <br>It was terrible looking. One side is okay.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now can you touch, tap, rub it and let us see.
    <br>Do you feel anything?
    <br>No pain.
    <br>Before, when you had this problem, this terrible skin disease,
    <br>were you able to touch or rub it?
    <br>I could not even bend down.
    <br>You couldn't even bend down?
    <br>Wow. Can you exercise your body now.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Thank you. Glory be to God in the highest.
    <br>Looking at what God has done in your life, setting you free,
    <br>bringing you back from death to life,
    <br>what word of advice do you have for people who are listening to you?
    <br>There are many people out there - doubting Thomases -
    <br>who don't even believe in the power of miracle but you are a living testimony.
    <br>What advice do you have for them?
    <br>What I have to say is that in any situation you face,
    <br>don't give up but put your hope in God.
    <br>Hallelujah. Thank you very much.
    <br>Indeed, no matter the circumstances, no matter the situation, do not lose hope.
    <br>Put all your faith and trust in God.
    <br>At God's own time, that problem will be over, in Jesus' name.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My advice goes like this:
    <br>Sometimes, women may have brothers passing through a difficult challenge
    <br>in such a way that it is difficult to associate with them.
    <br>But if you can summon courage, because even the day he was prayed for,
    <br>people who were watching live in Makurdi,
    <br>they were calling me to say that I was wicked.
    <br>I asked what manner of wickedness I had shown.
    <br>They asked why I took such a risk to travel with him and my child to Lagos.
    <br>They asked if the man had died on the road, what question would I answer.
    <br>I said that even if he died, I was not a murderer but looking for solution.
    <br>I knew that God would not allow him to die on the road.
    <br>But the risk you take today based on the leading of God will bring success tomorrow.
    <br>We are here today celebrating life.
    <br>Hallelujah.

    <br>And standing by, watching the man of God just stretching his hand at a distance
    <br>towards your brother and he started vomiting, how did you feel?
    <br>What can you say about the power of God?
    <br>Seeing the man of God alone, even before he stretched his hand to pray,
    <br>I knew my brother would not die.
    <br>When he stretched forth his hand, I knew the end to the calamity had come.
    <br>This is a new beginning!
    <br>Hallelujah. Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Indeed, a new beginning.
    <br>Old things are gone, all things become new.
    <br>That is the promise of God.
    <br>We want to thank God Almighty for your life, sir.
    <br>For being alive today to share this wonderful testimony
    <br>because of the grace of God in the life of His able servant Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We also just want to know, because of our viewers all over the world who want to know,
    <br>we know that miracle is only a means to an end but not the end itself.
    <br>The end is the salvation of our soul.
    <br>Can you tell us, since you received this miracle, this healing,
    <br>how has it influenced your life? Has it drawn you closer to Christ?
    <br>Are you living your life for the glory of God, now that you have received His mercy and grace?
    <br>Since I was delivered, I have surrendered my life to Christ.
    <br>I will never go back to sin again!
    <br>So the way you are talking now with ease,
    <br>were you able to talk freely like this with ease, before now?
    <br>No.
    <br>Hallelujah. No more pain?
    <br>There's no more pain. I can talk freely.
    <br>Hallelujah. Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Thank you. Indeed, this miracle is more than enough to change one's life entirely.
    <br>And now that you have recognised the power of God and have also encountered it,
    <br>we want to encourage you to remain in faith in Christ Jesus,
    <br>continue to make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and your miracle will be permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>So once again, sister, we want to thank you very much
    <br>for allowing yourself to be used for the glory of God
    <br>to bring this man to the arena of liberty where he was set free.
    <br>We thank God you are part of this wonderful testimony, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Mr Jude Oraka & Sister

    <br>To God be the glory. This is what we are praising God for.

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>We thank God today; we travelled all the way from Makurdi to come and testify.
    <br>The man of God sheltered us, gave us accommodation and took care of us.
    <br>He fed us with delicious food in the morning, afternoon and evening.
    <br>What he has done for us is wonderful and today, we are here to thank Jesus
    <br>for all God has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in our family.
    <br>May the Almighty God reward him, his ministry and his family.
    <br>I wish them Heaven at last. They shall make it.
    <br>When I had this problem, I couldn't work. My sister helped me to do everything.
    <br>She lent me money because I could not work for the past six years.
    <br>She gave me money, fed me and helped me in everything that I needed.
    <br>I had no money because I couldn't work then.
    <br>But now you are back to your work?
    <br>I'm back to my work as a driver.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua together with Emmanuel TV Partners decided
    <br>to give you the total sum of 200,000 naira and also transportation money of 20,000 naira.
    <br>Everything is here. The prophet said we should give you this.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank you, Man of God!
    <br>I thank you very much for assisting me. I give thanks to God.
    <br>I pray God will bless him, his family and the members of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am here to appreciate God who used Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He is one among millions; I have never seen someone like him before.
    <br>For God to use him to bless my family with the sum of N220,000,
    <br>I appreciate him and pray the good Lord would reward him, his family
    <br>and all the partners of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>His finances shall never run dry and the Lord, my God shall water him.
    <br>For the blessing given to this family, it will move from strength to strength,
    <br>never backwards. I return all the glory to God. Thank You Jesus!
