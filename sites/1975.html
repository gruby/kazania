    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Be in an attitude of prayer; it is time to pray.
    <br>Whatever pain, sickness, affliction you have,
    <br>the Word of God can heal you wherever you are.
    <br>Jesus sent forth His Word and healed them.
    <br>Are you ready to receive that healing?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be in an attitude of prayer; it is time to pray."
    <br>Be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>Right now, are you ready?
    <br>Ask God to help you to grow in love.
    <br>Help me, Lord, to grow in love.
    <br>Jesus, help me to grow in love.
    <br>Grant me a loving heart.
    <br>Ask Jesus, "Grant me a loving heart."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Grant me a loving heart.
    <br>Ask God, "Grant me a loving heart -
    <br>a heart to give and share."
    <br>Give me a loving heart - a heart to give and share.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, we cast out those evil spirits, afflictions, sicknesses and diseases!
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>I can't hear you.
