    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua, everywhere you go.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, prepare your hearts to receive
    <br>and get ready to pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, God Almighty will take you from glory to glory.
    <br>Pray along in faith, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Begin to disconnect yourself.
    <br>There are breakthroughs and there is a breakthrough.
    <br>Receive that breakthrough that makes one to forget the pain,
    <br>that makes one to forget the reproach.
    <br>When you receive this breakthrough, you forget the past.
    <br>Begin to receive that breakthrough right now.
    <br>Receive it right now.
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>There are breakthroughs and there is a breakthrough.
    <br>That breakthrough that makes one to forget the past,
    <br>that breakthrough that makes one to forget the reproach,
    <br>that breakthrough that makes one to forget the shame,
    <br>that breakthrough that makes one to forget the discomfort,
    <br>that breakthrough that makes one to forget the hardship,
    <br>that breakthrough,
    <br>receive it, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to receive it!
    <br>Receive it!
    <br>Viewers at home, open your lips.
    <br>I say to your business, breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough in your career!
    <br>Breakthrough in your finances!
    <br>Breakthrough in your marital life!
    <br>Breakthrough in your career!
    <br>Breakthrough in your destiny!
    <br>Say, breakthrough!
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Begin to receive that breakthrough!
    <br>Every step, breakthrough!
    <br>Every effort, breakthrough!
    <br>Every utterance, breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Confess the breakthrough!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>There are breakthroughs and there is a breakthrough -
    <br>that breakthrough that makes one to forget the pain,
    <br>insults you have received in the past.
    <br>I mean, that type of breakthrough I experienced over the years.
    <br>That breakthrough, when it comes to your life, you will forget the past.
    <br>You will forget the reproach.
    <br>You will forget the shame.
    <br>You will forget the hardship.
    <br>Say, breakthrough!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to confess breakthrough!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>You hear people complaining,
    <br>"I will not forgive him;
    <br>I will not forgive her".
    <br>"He insulted me. I will not forgive."
    <br>When you receive the breakthrough I experienced over the years,
    <br>you will forgive everyone!
    <br>Shame and reproach in the past, name callings,
    <br>whatever name they call you,
    <br>you have not received breakthrough; that is why you cannot forgive.
    <br>That breakthrough that makes one to forget the pain of the past,
    <br>the shame of the past,
    <br>the reproach of the past,
    <br>the name calling of the past,
    <br>the hardship of the past,
    <br>the discomfort of the past.
    <br>Say, breakthrough!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>I want to give you a prayer point
    <br>to help you maintain this blessing you have received.
    <br>Viewers at home, I'm giving you as it is given to me.
    <br>It is given to me and I'm giving you.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning and you are going to work,
    <br>say, "When I struggle, when I wrestle to discover the next thing to do,
    <br>the next step to take,
    <br>Oh Lord, open the door - door of mercy, door of favour,
    <br>door of breakthrough!"
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>And continue your journey.
    <br>It is the prayer language the Lord said I should give you.
    <br>It's for you.
    <br>You will not say this in vain.
    <br>Confess your freedom!
    <br>Confess your release!
    <br>Because you are released!
    <br>RECEIVE THAT BREAKTHROUGH!!!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
