  <p>    
    <br>If the way you pray is the same way I do pray,
    <br>my prayer would not answer.
    <br>Look, let me tell you a few words about prayer.
    <br>When you see me stretching my hand to pray for you,
    <br>that is not just the beginning.
    <br>I consider where I am coming from before I pray.
    <br>I must have been in an attitude of prayer before I say, "Be healed".
    <br>If I'm not in an attitude of prayer, in the realm of prayer,
    <br>I cannot say, "Be healed!"
    <br>Whom am I going to call when I'm not in the realm of prayer?
    <br>Jesus is in the realm of prayer; that is why He answers prayer.
    <br>When you are not in that realm of prayer and you are praying,
    <br>whom are you calling, whom are you talking to?
    <br>You are talking to yourself; you must be in the realm.
    <br>You can't stand here and begin to call somebody in Oshodi (Nigeria).
    <br>You must be in Oshodi (Nigeria) to call the person in Oshodi.

    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You can't stand here and begin to call someone in London (UK),
    <br>without being in London.
    <br>I mean, without any technology, using your mouth.
    <br>You cannot use your handset and begin to pray;
    <br>you want to use your handset to call Jesus. No!
    <br>It is not possible. You must get there and call the person.
    <br>It is meditation that takes us to Him.
    <br>When we get to Him, we pray.
    <br>But you don't meditate and you pray.
    <br>It is meditation that carries us to Jesus.
    <br>It carries us to Jesus. Look at the fruit.
    <br>Can you see the fruit here?
    <br>It is not possible for me here to take the fruit.
    <br>My hand is not that long; I cannot get any fruit.
    <br>I must get there to get the fruit.
    <br>To get there, it is by meditation.
    <br>Meditation will take me to the fruit.
    <br>And when I get there, I will now...
    <br>Prayer is ask, you shall be given; knock, it shall be opened.
    <br>That is prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, the picture of your life is:
    <br>You are here and you asking for fruit; you want fruit.
    <br>"I want fruit, I want fruit" - who will give you the fruit? You cannot...
    <br>Look at it - you are far from the fruit.
    <br>Meditation removes the obstacles and takes you there.
    <br>It takes you to the realm of prayer - meditation.
    <br>This is why we say: Meditation in God's Word is a visit with God.
    <br>Tell you neighbour.
    <br>Meditation in God's Word is a visit with God.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Meditation in God's Word is a visit with God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What are we meditating? God's Word.
    <br>Do you know that something is greater than all what you are waiting for?
    <br>Hearing from God is a much greater blessing than
    <br>any of the blessings you are waiting for.
    <br>To hear. You know when you hear from God,
    <br>you will know whether what you are asking for is the right thing to receive.
    <br>When you hear from God, you will know when to leave here.
    <br>When you hear from God, you will know who is talking to you.
    <br>When you hear from God, you will know when to go to work.
    <br>All this trouble that is happening all over the world - people don't hear from God.
    <br>Hearing from God while praying is a much greater blessing
    <br>than any blessing you are seeking - healing...
    <br>Hearing from God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are ignorant of things of God.
    <br>You see God as one of those things
    <br>and God is not one of those things. He is...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't wait until your last day before you know God; you have to know God.
    <br>Because you have wasted so many years and time.
    <br>If you knew the plan of God for your life,
    <br>you would be crying, "Ha, this is the plan of God for my life".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A break in prayer is a break in God.
    <br>You should be ready at any time.
    <br>It is not when the situation is at hand, you pray.
    <br>You should always be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>What is now going on in your heart?
    <br>If you don't engage your heart, something else will take over your heart.
    <br>Right now, begin to engage your heart.
    <br>The heart cannot be neutral; it must say something.
    <br>You must take hold of your heart so that your past will not take hold of your heart -
    <br>where you are coming from, your situation.
    <br>Take hold of your heart; Jesus loves you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
