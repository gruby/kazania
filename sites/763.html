    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, help me to walk properly!
    <br>Healing in Jesus' Name
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was led by the unction of the Holy Spirit
    <br>to pray for the sick and afflicted, and miracles, signs and wonders followed.
    <br>Healing in Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I came from Kang Won-Do and I am grateful! Hallelujah!
    <br>Healed in Jesus' Name
    <br>After a supernatural encounter with Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>Pastor Kim Hong Deok came back the next day of the South Korea Crusade
    <br>to testify to the world of his encounter with the Living God.
    <br>Let's hear from him.
    <br>SOUTH KOREA CRUSADE WITH T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>I am Pastor Kim Hong Deok,
    <br>I am from Kang Won-Do, South Korea.

    <br>I came to receive healing for my fractured leg.
    <br>As a pastor, I climbed a ladder to repair a projector on the ceiling with one of the elders.
    <br>The ladder could not support the weight of two people and it broke.
    <br>I fell from three storeys high.
    <br>The doctors diagnosed that both my legs were fractured
    <br>and that my right leg was in a severe condition.
    <br>They had to place an artificial heel implant.
    <br>So, I was operated upon in a hospital.

    <br>It has been six months since I did the operation.

    <br>The bones in my heel were shattered.

    <br>The doctor had to put an artifical bone in my heel and used screws to fix it there.

    <br>Every time I walked, I suffered a lot of pain in my feet because of the screws.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, the power of the Holy Spirit fell upon me.
    <br>After the prayer, I ran like this.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!

    <br>Thank You, Jesus!

    <br>Sir, we want you to explain what exactly happened to you yesterday
    <br>when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you. Just describe that experience.
    <br>I prayed
    <br>and when the power of God flowed through Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>all the screws and iron in my feet melted.
    <br>I prayed for about a month before I came here and I was sure that God would heal my feet and heel.
    <br>God hears our prayers.
    <br>Believers all over the world who are watching this crusade, I believed God heard my prayer.
    <br>I knew I would share my testimony right here at the 2016 South Korea Crusade.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, I felt the fire of the Holy Spirit working in my feet.
    <br>I instantly felt the fire of the Holy Spirit reach my foot as Prophet T.B. Joshua touched my body.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ. We give all the glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Hallelujah! We know there are many people who are here waiting
    <br>to receive their own touch from Heaven today on the second day
    <br>of the 2016 South Korea Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What is your advice to those who are present here and our viewers all over the world?
    <br>A prayer of faith will surely be fulfilled.
    <br>I pray that God will bless you all.
    <br>A prayer of faith will work and God will touch everyone in this room today.
    <br>God bless you. Thank you!
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Finally, sir, for the glory of God, can you just one more time demonstrate
    <br>what you can do now that you could not do before.
    <br>I was limping like this before but I always testified that God would heal me.
    <br>God heard my prayer and I received my healing.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Thank you!
