    <br>Jesus' name must be honoured.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Thank you. 
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You listen to the message, "Jesus' name must be honoured".
    <br>For Jesus' name to be honoured.
    <br>That is the question, "How can Jesus' name be honoured?"
    <br>John asked me to call you - you refuse to answer - that is not honour.
    <br>You say, "John, John!" - and John refuses to hear you, or you refuse to hear John - that is not honour.
    <br>You say, "John, John!" - no response - that is not honour.
    <br>For Jesus' name to be honoured - is a "million dollars" question.
    <br>"Kinsly, Kinsly!" - no response.
    <br>For Jesus' name to be honoured.
    <br>That is a question for everyone of us.
    <br>The question is, 'Is Jesus' name being honoured?'
    <br>Viewers, we know you are there and we can feel it.
    <br>You are with us and we are with you.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier and your Bible is there with you.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of John 6, verse 63.
    <br>Viewers, going by the song we've just sung now, "Jesus' name must be honoured.
    <br>Jesus' name must be honoured in my life everyday."
    <br>Is this being honoured in your life?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>John 6:63 says, "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.
    <br>The Words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit and life."
    <br>And you know that Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>Here in John 6:63 it says, "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.
    <br>The Words I have spoken to you – they are full of the Spirit and life."
    <br>Go also down, to the verse 65, "He went on to say, 'This is why I told you that no one can come to Me
    <br>unless the Father has enabled them.'"
    <br>You can't just wake up and say, "I'm going to Jesus" - you must be enabled.
    <br>This means you must be enabled and energised.
    <br>You can't just say, "I'm a child of God."
    <br>A lot of people say, "I'm a child of God" today.
    <br>There are many children of God, who say, "Jesus is Lord".
    <br>You don't need licence to do that.
    <br>Now, going by that John 6:65, "No one can come to Me unless he is enabled."
    <br>This means, for Jesus' name to be honoured, God's Word must be Spirit and life.
    <br>We have the language of today and the language of the Bible that saves, creates and rules over us.
    <br>For Jesus' name to be honoured, God's Word must be Spirit and life.
    <br>It's not just to be born of the Word but you must be born of the Spirit.
    <br>Because the Word refreshes our mind and the Spirit renews our strength.
    <br>This means, two things must join, merge and come together – the Spirit and the Word.
    <br>Two things must join and merge – the Spirit and the Word – to be born again,
    <br>for the name of Jesus to be honoured.
    <br>It's not just to say, "Be healed!"
    <br>It must be Spirit and life.
    <br>The power of God must go through the Word and the Spirit to bring about that.
    <br>That is, when you see God, you see power.
    <br>God must drive through the Spirit and the Word to bring about that.
    <br>The Word dominating you is the Lordship of Christ in you.
    <br>By meditation, the Word can dominate.
    <br>It dominates us through meditation, obeying, acting and reading.
    <br>Meditation is a visit to Him.
    <br>This is to say that the Word has priority over His name.
    <br>The Word has priority over His name.
    <br>This is why when you call the name "Jesus, in Jesus' name"...
    <br>Even in your dreams people come to attack you and you say, "Jesus!" but they keep attacking and beating you.
    <br>Or, after the attack you say "Jesus!".
    <br>You want to say "Jesus!" before the attack but there is no enablement, energy, power or grace.
    <br>Jesus' name is not to be called after the attack.
    <br>Anyone can say, "Thank You, Jesus" after the miracle but not everyone can say, "Jesus" before the miracle.
    <br>When you see the miracle is about to happen, you will be looking at it, "Will this happen? How will this happen?"
    <br>You will want to see how it will happen, "Can this happen?" - you will be looking at it.
    <br>When the miracle happens, "Jesus!" - but before it happens...
    <br>It takes faith to say, "Jesus"...
    <br>It takes faith to say, "Jesus, thank You" before the miracle
    <br>but anyone can say, "Jesus, thank You" after the miracle.
    <br>As you are sitting down, you have pain and challenges.
    <br>It takes faith to say, "Thank You, Jesus, It's over".
    <br>But it doesn’t take anything to say, "Jesus, thank You" when it is over.
    <br>After being healed, "Thank You, Jesus" - but now to say "Thank You, Jesus" - it takes faith.
    <br>Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He has promised to do – that is faith.
    <br>The man of faith will say, "Thank You, Jesus for blessing me" before blessing
    <br>but today, we say, "Thank You, Jesus" after blessing.
    <br>God's Word has power over His name - yes.
    <br>By the Word, we are saved.
    <br>It is the Word of God that has taught us the value, authority of the name Jesus
    <br>and our legal right to use the name, Jesus.
    <br>Anybody can use the name, Jesus but how many have the right to use the name?
    <br>How many of you can say, "Jesus" and Jesus will come to the scene?
    <br>So, until you have the legal right of using the name...
    <br>He said, "In My name you shall cast out demons" and you say, "In Jesus' name, out demon!" -
    <br>without the Word of God dominating your heart.
    <br>It is when the Word dominates your heart, it influences your character and thoughts
    <br>it influences your character and conduct.
    <br>"In My name you shall cast out demons" - yes, Bible says this.
    <br>I walk towards a demon and say, "In Jesus' name - be delivered!"
    <br>God's Word has priority over His name.
    <br>How would that happen?
    <br>How will you bring Jesus to the scene?
    <br>It is impossible.
    <br>If you don’t have God's Word, you have nothing at all.
    <br>If you don’t have God's Word, you cannot bring Jesus onto the scene.
    <br>If you don’t have God's Word, you have nothing at all.
    <br>If you don’t have God's Word, you cannot bring Jesus onto the scene.
    <br>You say, "Jesus!" and Jesus says, "What are you saying? What do you want?"
    <br>So, your song:
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br>In my life every day
    <br>How can Jesus be honoured when the Word is not dominating your heart?
    <br>It is when God's Word dominates your heart, it can influence your character, thoughts and conduct.
    <br>Your character before now: "I don't know if it will happen. Can this be happening?"
    <br>When God's Word dominates your heart, it changes your perception, the way you reason.
    <br>"This will happen. It can happen. This is God's Word."
    <br>It is God's Word that builds faith in the believers.
    <br>Christ can only come to your heart through faith; your heart is His dwelling place.
    <br>That is where He dwells; the panel where He controls you, the contact point – your heart.
    <br>That is why the Bible says faith is of man's heart.
    <br>By living in the Word and by the Word living in us, we have the legal right to use the name of Jesus.
    <br>We have the legal right to the name Jesus.
    <br>Yes - Jesus!
    <br>Look at the Book of Mark 16 verse 18:
    <br>"They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover."
    <br>This means nothing will ever happen without acting on the Word.
    <br>Nothing, unless we act on the Word.
    <br>Because the Word has priority over His name.
    <br>This is why you keep praying for people, "Be healed"...
    <br>Bible says, "They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover".
    <br>Because...
    <br>the Word gives value, authority and legal right.
    <br>When you call, "Jesus" without the Word, it is like you are calling your brother at home.
    <br>Many of your brothers have name Jesus.
    <br>Many people out there bear the name Jesus.
    <br>They say their own name is Jesus.
    <br>It is like calling somebody among you without the Word.
    <br>This is what you are facing.
    <br>No one can say, "Jesus is the Healer", no one can say, "Jesus is Lord",
    <br>no one can say, "Jesus is the Redeemer", unless he is guided by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You must be guided.
    <br>We want to be like Jesus.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is our guide.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I want to be like Jesus. The Holy Spirit is my guide."
    <br>He must be the One to guide you to be like Him.
    <br>He must guide you to be like Jesus.
    <br>It is not like imitating your father at home, observing what your father is doing.
    <br>My father has a beard - me too, I need to have a beard.
    <br>This is the way my father walks - I need to walk like that.
    <br>That is an imitation of a man.
    <br>Imitation of God – I want to be like Jesus; the Holy Spirit is my guide.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>Inner my heart.
    <br>I want you to open your mouth and say, "Thank You, Jesus for giving me faith to believe."
    <br>You hear what verse 65 of John 6 is saying.
    <br>It says, "No one can come to Me unless he is guided, enabled."
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus for giving me faith to believe."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is it.
    <br>I want to be like Jesus - Holy Spirit is my guide.
    <br>I cannot just wake up and say, "I want to be like Jesus. This is the way Jesus walks. I will read my Bible.
    <br>Let me see what the Bible says about Jesus - I will follow what the Bible says about Jesus" - no.
    <br>Following Jesus...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to be like Jesus - Holy Spirit is my guide.
    <br>He guides me, "Thank You, Jesus for giving me faith to believe" - this his how I offer my prayer.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus for giving me faith to believe."
    <br>Only faith pleases Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need to say that.
    <br>I know this is the first time you think about that this way, "You need faith to believe?"
    <br>He has said it.
    <br>It is the Word that has taught us the authority to say, "Leave, come, go!"
    <br>The Word of God taught us.
    <br>That Word must be Spirit and life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He has promised He will never fail
    <br>I will follow Him
    <br>I will follow Him
    <br>He has promised He will never fail
    <br>His faithfulness
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>His faithfulness.
    <br>That is why no matter what you are going through if life, declare God's faithfulness.
    <br>No matter what you are going through, no matter the situation you are in, declare God's faithfulness.
    <br>Whether He heals you or not, He is God.
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>Amen
    <br>Whether you are blessed or not...
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>Amen
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"No matter what you are going through, no matter your situation, declare God's faithfulness."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Stand up to declare God's faithfulness, no matter the challenges
    <br>because He has made a way where there is no way for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is how to overcome all those things you are facing.
    <br>You see what happened to Daniel in the lion's den and to Meshach, Shadrach, Abed-Nego in the furnace.
    <br>What manner of man is Jesus
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>That is over to you.
    <br>What manner of man is Jesus in my life I know.
    <br>In your life you know it is different.
    <br>No matter what you are going through - tell your neighbour, "Declare God's faithfulness".
    <br>(No matter what you are going through, declare God's faithfulness.)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(No matter what you are going through, declare God's faithfulness.)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(No matter what you are going through, declare God's faithfulness.)
    <br>Because I am sensing God's deliverance.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>I am sensing God's way out for you.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>No matter what you are going through, all you need is to declare God's faithfulness.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Will you open your lips and begin to declare God's faithfulness in your life.
    <br>No matter what you are going through...
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>That's all.
    <br>Just declare God's faithfulness and see what comes next!
    <br>If your declaration comes from the heart - oh my God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Is your declaration coming from the heart?"
    <br>(Is your declaration coming from the heart?)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(Is your declaration coming from the heart?)
    <br>You mean it?
    <br>(You mean it?)
    <br>Your declaration comes from the heart?
    <br>(Your declaration comes from the heart?)
    <br>If your declaration comes from the heart...
