    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, we are here as a contact.
    <br>As we are receiving, you will be receiving over there.
    <br>Anointing to heal, deliver and set free is transferable.
    <br>There is no difference between we that are here and you that are somewhere.
    <br>God manifests mightily in distance.
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>As we are being delivered here, you will be delivered there.
    <br>Believing is your connection.
    <br>Just get connected, right now.
    <br>Viewers, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Come out!
