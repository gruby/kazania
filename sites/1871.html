    <br>There is a gentleman here, you are fighting your wife because of a boy.
    <br>A baby boy.

    <br>She delivered a baby boy - you are saying they should go for a lot of...
    <br>Why do you say he is not yours?
    <br>This is why I am calling you.
    <br>Because you saw a letter?

    <br>You say this boy is not your own.
    <br>This woman slept with a man outside and carried the pregnancy to the...
    <br>This battle has been there - and the boy is there now.
    <br>This is tormenting your life.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>The Case Of The MYSTERY Child!!!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Prince Napoleon Paul Amanfo.
    <br>I came from Benue State.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave is actually truth.
    <br>I was sitting somewhere there when this prophecy came.
    <br>I quickly got up because I felt it was my prophecy.
    <br>Around 2009, I lost my first wife.
    <br>Later, after about one year, I went for another wife.
    <br>While we were preparing to get married, I went to my wife's business centre,
    <br>and I met her with one man.
    <br>She introduced that man to me as her boyfriend.
    <br>I watched the man.
    <br>I didn't feel bad anyway because I knew they must have known each other
    <br>ever before I came into her life.
    <br>So I turned, I shook a hand with the man - we greeted.
    <br>After an exchange of pleasantries, I told the man,
    <br>"From today, please - this woman has become my wife - I married her.
    <br>Whatever that is holding both of you should stop from today, henceforth."
    <br>The man agreed.
    <br>But to my greatest surprise I began to see this man around.
    <br>While we were preparing, my wife was still living in her own house,
    <br>where she was living before I met her.
    <br>One fateful day, I visited her - I saw a picture on the wall
    <br>and it was the picture of the man I spoke with.
    <br>I told my wife to remove that picture from there.
    <br>She promised to do that.
    <br>I was expecting her to do that immediately - she never did it.
    <br>Few days later, I went to her place.
    <br>The picture was still hanging there.
    <br>I called her and I said, "I thought you said you would remove this picture."
    <br>She said she would do that.
    <br>The third time I went to her place - she has removed the picture.
    <br>I was happy.
    <br>Later, she moved to where I live.
    <br>We started living as husband and wife, in the same apartment.
    <br>After some time, she told me that she had some feeling.
    <br>I asked her to go for a medical test.
    <br>She went and came back and it was pregnancy.
    <br>We were happy about that.
    <br>From that day she showed me pregnancy test, we never met again, until she gave birth.
    <br>In fact, we did not meet till she stopped breastfeeding the child.
    <br>She just lost affection.
    <br>We still continued staying together.
    <br>One day I was going through an album she gave me.
    <br>The very same picture I asked her to take away from her life was inside the album.
    <br>I smartly took the picture away and hid it and up till now she is not even aware of that.
    <br>I hid the picture.
    <br>As this child was growing...
    <br>Can you tell us the sex of the baby - the child you are talking about?
    <br>It is a baby boy.
    <br>As the boy was growing, I started having some feelings,
    <br>"Is this child actually for me?"
    <br>If my wife has stayed for more than a year without meeting with me,
    <br>that means she is having somebody outside who is having a good time with her.
    <br>That was just my feeling.
    <br>The suspicion kept coming to my mind.
    <br>As this boy was growing, without her knowing it,
    <br>I would sometimes bring this picture of this very man
    <br>and try to compare...
    <br>Prophesy Testimony
    <br>... try to compare the look; whether there is a resemblance of myself or of that man.
    <br>This thing kept going.
    <br>She never knew; nobody knew.
    <br>Sometimes, in her business centre,
    <br>if I come back from work and go there, I would see this very man sitting with my wife, chatting.
    <br>I would start feeling very bad.
    <br>I told her, "Leave this man. The problems we are having are based on this man."
    <br>That suspicion kept coming towards me.
    <br>It was affecting me actually, like the man of God said.
    <br>The reason I came here last Sunday was what she said two weeks ago, before I left home.
    <br>I was on my way to the East, and I said, "Let me come here and pray here."
    <br>She said something that touched my heart.
    <br>She said that since me and my children wanted to kill her,
    <br>because my first wife left two female children for me,
    <br>since we wanted to kill her, she would kill us one by one.
    <br>I felt bad.
    <br>I said, "This woman - something is wrong with her."
    <br>I called her and asked if she was the one saying this.
    <br>"Let me tell you; if you don't do away with this very man in you life,
    <br>this man will destroy you and the entire family."
    <br>That was what prompted my coming to Synagogue.
    <br>Behold, last Sunday, my meditation was, "God, settle my home."
    <br>Last Sunday, when I was sitting on the opposite side, the prophecy came
    <br>and I quickly grabbed it and came out.
    <br>That was how the whole thing went.
    <br>That is the wife coming forward and a little boy, as you are seeing.
    <br>Right now, we want to hear from them, what the wife has to say,
    <br>regarding the prophecy that was given to her husband.
    <br>My name is Ngozi Amonfo.
    <br>I reside in Benue State.
    <br>The boy beside me is Emmanuel Amonfo - he is my son.
    <br>I thank God for this day.
    <br>I am here in respect of the prophecy given to my husband.
    <br>Last week Sunday; before then he told me he was coming to the Synagogue for prayer.
    <br>I said, "OK, it is fine."
    <br>During the night after that Sunday there was no light because of the energy supply cut.
    <br>It was on the Monday morning I watched the replay - I saw the prophecy.
    <br>I said, "Glory be to God."
    <br>If it was the root of the problems and the unhappiness in the family...
    <br>When I saw the prophecy, I thanked God.
    <br>We met in a dirty environment.
    <br>I sold beer, and he was a worker in brewery.
    <br>That was how we met.
    <br>When he came to me and he asked for my hand, I accepted.
    <br>In the process of introducing, he told me that he had a girlfriend before.
    <br>I said fine.
    <br>Then, he saw my friend around - they greeted.
    <br>While preparing for the marriage I got pregnant.
    <br>If he comes to the beer parlour...
    <br>You know the nature of the business - you must have men and women around you,
    <br>you greet, you chat with them.
    <br>When he comes, he says he is not happy seeing this guy there.
    <br>Between two of us there is nothing.
    <br>In the process, I gave birth to this child.
    <br>All of the sudden, I noticed there was no affection towards him.
    <br>I was asking, "God, what is happening? What this little boy did?"
    <br>His daddy is not showing kindness.
    <br>He could not even hold him on the street, take him to bathroom to bath him.
    <br>I was confused.
    <br>I said, "No problem. God, You know how we started
    <br>and I know that anything that is not from You, You will put a stop to it."
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>Seeing him on the TV that day telling that he suspected...
    <br>I was confused.
    <br>We have heard from the wife, what she had to say regarding the prophecy
    <br>that was given by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty that everybody whom prophecy concerns is right here before us.
    <br>We are seeing clearly the picture right in front of us.
    <br>Right now, we can rest the case, because man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>will definitely come to the matter.
    <br>We are going to hear from the man of God the heart of God,
    <br>because God Almighty has the final say.
    <br>Right now, let us rest the case here and wait for God's instruction
    <br>through His anointed one, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Thank you very much for your response to the issue on the ground.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>If you honour a prophet because he is a prophet, you receive a prophet's reward.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>If I may listen to your testimony - when you said you people met in a very dirty environment.
    <br>I know you people had not given yourselves to deliverance,
    <br>and when you meet in such an environment, the first thing is to go for deliverance.
    <br>After the deliverance, you ask God for direction.
    <br>But why we are here today is because of this little one.
    <br>I was looking at the whole thing, trying to trace the father of this boy.
    <br>Look, my brother...
    <br>Forget about the circumstances surrounding your situation, your challenges -
    <br>so many circumstances -
    <br>this is your blood.
    <br>Wait, before...
    <br>Uncle, wait!
    <br>The Case Of The MYSTERY Child!!!
    <br>This is your blood.
    <br>There are so many circumstances but I traced it to your blood - this guy.
    <br>But I will not stand here and say the marriage should continue.
    <br>After the deliverance, you need to ask God:
    <br>Is this woman your wife?
    <br>Is this man your husband?
    <br>But my assignment at this moment - this boy is yours.
    <br>The Case Of The MYSTERY Child!!!
    <br>Irrespective of people that have met her in the past,
    <br>if 100 men sleep with a single woman
    <br>and at the end of the day, that woman conceives,
    <br>it is one of the 100 that owns the baby,
    <br>and you are the one.
    <br>The Case Of The MYSTERY Child!!!
    <br>This is just my assignment.
    <br>I want to meet you,
    <br>so that I can tell you people about the deliverance.
    <br>After your deliverance you need to ask God:
    <br>Who is this woman? Is it my wife?
    <br>Who is this man? Is this man my husband?
    <br>But this boy is yours.
    <br>The Case Of The MYSTERY Child!!!
    <br>Thank you very much.
