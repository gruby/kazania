    <br>Indonesia Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Let me introduce myself.
    <br>My name is Fikri Samosir. I am from North Sumatra in Indonesia.
    <br>This is my wife and my two children. I have two boys and one girl.
    <br>I would like to testify about what happened that night, September 28.
    <br>When I went to the crusade, I was touched by God.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua placed his hand on my head,
    <br>I didn’t know what happened after that.
    <br>Suddenly, my body was thrown backwards.
    <br>I knew that there were seven evil spirits in me.
    <br>One of them was called Beelzebub.
    <br>Because of the evil spirit in me, there was this hatred and anger
    <br>towards the servant of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Do you want to fight me?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>I hated him so much and was so angry that I wanted to attack him.
    <br>But because of the power of God in Prophet T.B. Joshua, the evil spirit in me had no power.
    <br>My body, at that time, was thrown backwards several times, like you can see on the video.
    <br>At that time, those seven evil spirits had to leave my body.
    <br>Now I am free! Because of the power of God, because God loves me, He did not abandon me;
    <br>He did not let those seven spirits to bind me.
    <br>I thank the Lord who loves me so much. He has blessed me so much.
    <br>I thank His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua, who is used by the Lord, and for his ministry.
    <br>Thank God because my wife, my children and I can be so happy and have such peace,
    <br>like nothing I have experienced before. I have never experienced it before -
    <br>a freedom that has been given by the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>And even right now, I have such a joy in my heart tonight that I can stand up here and give testimony.
    <br>I have a mission, a plan, a vision - I want to serve God full time because God loves me so much.
    <br>I'm going to continue to give my testimony, how much God loves me, how much I love Him.
    <br>I love Him so much because of His anointing that flows through me.
    <br>And tonight... Thank you so much to the Lord. Thank you so much.
    <br>I am not going to stand here any longer
    <br>because all of the things I've done in the past, when I was disappointed,
    <br>when I was angry, when I hated people - my family, my brother, sister, younger brother,
    <br>all those people, but the Lord set me free from that hatred.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. Thank You, Jesus. Thank You.
    <br>This is my testimony.
    <br>Please, pray for me.
    <br>Pray for my family, so that we will always be close and intimate with God. Thank you.

    <br>You are Holy
    <br>Holy Lord and forever You are God
    <br>Thank You Lord
    <br>You are Holy
    <br>Holy Lord and forever You are God
    <br>Indonesia Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>My name is Elisabeth, 52 years old, from Jakarta, Indonesia.
    <br>We saw you in the prayer line tonight and we saw Prophet T.B.Joshua coming towards you.
    <br>Tell us what happened when you were in the prayer line.
    <br>At first, I prayed for my daughter because she had autism.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, I felt something hot inside of me.
    <br>At first, I prayed for my daughter because she had autism.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, I felt something hot inside of me.
    <br>I felt a war within me that I wanted to hit the man of God. I hated him.
    <br>You want to fight me too?
    <br>Yes, I hate you.
    <br>It made my knees tremble so much that I fell down.
    <br>I felt like there was something cold that touched me, when the man of God prayed for me
    <br>that made me fall down to the floor.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>Indonesia Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Yes, that is right.
    <br>When I fell down, I felt like there was something heavy that was removed from my heart.
    <br>What I have just said is right.
    <br>After the prayer, he said that the evil spirit within me had gone.

    <br>Jesus!

    <br>She is free.
    <br>After the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua, how are you feeling in your body now?
    <br>I feel free because something that was in my heart for the past couple of years has gone.
    <br>OK, after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua, how are you feeling now?
    <br>I got something great and a great independence that I have never had before!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We thank God, for what He has done in your life,
    <br>and we want to ask you, now that Jesus Christ has delivered you and set you free
    <br>through His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua, what is your promise to God?
    <br>I will be faithful and serve the Lord, amen!
    <br>Her promise is that she will be faithful and serve the Lord. Amen!
    <br>Amen. We pray with you that God will give that grace to stay close to Jesus, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
