  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Let me see your Bible.
    <br>This one is as old as my age.
    <br>There are many latest, new versions and all that but this one is very new.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We all want to know more of our wonderful, unseen Guest.
    <br>Everyone wants to know.
    <br>You know you are walking but you know Someone is with you.
    <br>You know you are talking but Someone is there talking for you.
    <br>You know as you are sitting, Someone is sitting behind you, before you.
    <br>You just want to know more of your wonderful, unseen Guest.
    <br>Everyone wants to know.
    <br>If I'm alone here, I cannot stand here
    <br>because if I tell you what many hearts are saying, "Who is this man?
    <br>What does he want to do? Is that the one they are talking about?"
    <br>Let's see what he will do".
    <br>What do you want to see?
    <br>A lot of things are going on in your heart.
    <br>Many say, "Oh, what is going to happen? Well, let's see".
    <br>"I've been watching this man on Emmanuel TV and what does he want to say?"
    <br>If I were alone I would not be able to stand here today but Someone is with me.
    <br>Everyone of us wants to know more of our wonderful, unseen Guest.
    <br>If I'm talking to you?
    <br>If you sleep, you know Someone is sleeping with you; that is why you can see today.
    <br>You sleep, you wake up. If not Someone with you, you would not be able to wake up.
    <br>Tell you neighbour, "We all want to know more of our wonderful, unseen Guest".
    <br>That will take me to the title, 'Our Supernatural Guest'.
    <br>Let's quickly take a look at the book of John 14
    <br>and then we can take our reading from verse 15 there.
    <br>Jesus promised the Holy Spirit.
    <br>He promised the Holy Spirit.
    <br>He has promised He will never fail
    <br>I will follow Him
    <br>That is why you are following Him.
    <br>He has promised He will never fail
    <br>His faithfulness is forevermore
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>He has promised His faithfulness will never what?
    <br>- Never fail.
    <br>Here you are today, eating, sleeping, walking, looking freely because of His promise.
    <br>Let's take our reading from verse 15:
    <br>"If you love me, keep my commands.
    <br>And I will ask the Father..."
    <br>"I will ask the Father" - listen to that.
    <br>"...and He will give you another advocate" - helper.
    <br>In some of your Bibles, it says, comforter.
    <br>"He will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever."
    <br>Not now alone - forever.
    <br>Take your time to read.
    <br>We will have a lot of texts in the book of Acts of Apostles.
    <br>Let me just give you a few you can take note of.
    <br>After the service today, take your time to read over this text.
    <br>This will also lead us to the books of Acts 4:23,
    <br>Acts 6:3,
    <br>Acts 13:52 - that will also be one of our proof readings,
    <br>Acts 4:31.
    <br>The one about you in person, in particular is Ephesians 5:18.
    <br>That will also lead us to that.
    <br>Acts 16:6-7.
    <br>Our Supernatural Guest
    <br>Unseen Guest
    <br>The yearning, we are yearning...
    <br>If I were alone, I would not be able to do all this. Someone is with me.
    <br>If I were alone, I would not be able to escape this tragedy. Someone is with me.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Someone is with me in the person of the Holy Ghost".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Someone is with me in the person of the Holy Ghost.]
    <br>King of kings, Lord of lords I worship
    <br>In that text John 14:15-16, it says, "If you love me, keep my commands".
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>He does nothing without His Word. He speaks to us through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>I will take it again. It says, "If you love me, keep my commands".
    <br>You say you love me, you are a child of God.
    <br>Keep my commands because I speak to you through my Word, by my Spirit.
    <br>In verse 16, it says, "I will ask the Father and He will give you another advocate to help you...".
    <br>This means, the Holy Spirit is another Comforter, another Helper.
    <br>Jesus Christ was the first Helper, first Comforter.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is another Helper - I mean Comforter.
    <br>In the absence of Jesus, the Holy Spirit was to be sent -
    <br>to take the place of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Worthy You are worthy
    <br>King of kings Lord of lords You are worthy
    <br>Worthy You are worthy
    <br>King of kings Lord of lords I worship You
    <br>He was, in a sense, to take the place of Jesus - the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is to be with us forever.
    <br>Forever oh Lord Your Word is settled
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>You mean, His Word is settled in your heart?
    <br>Heaven here in my heart?
    <br>Forever oh Lord Your Word is settled
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>The Holy Spirit is to be with us forever - through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>This is why the first text in verse 15 says, "If you love me, keep my commands".
    <br>His Word reflects His character.
    <br>I love the Man of Galilee
    <br>For He has done so very much for me
    <br>He has forgiven me all my sins
    <br>And sent the Holy Ghost to me
    <br>I love the Man of Galilee
    <br>If you love Him, say, "I love the Man of Galilee".
    <br>If you love Him, keep His Word.
    <br>He speaks to us through His Word by His Spirit because His Word reflects His character.
    <br>This is why the Bible says the Holy Spirit is not known or receved by everyone
    <br>but only those who keep His Word, only those who prepare for Him.
    <br>This is why many of you say, "What is Holy Spirit?" You don't know what Holy Spirit is.
    <br>You cannot receive the Holy Spirit without keeping His Word, abiding by His Word.
    <br>He said, "If you love Me, keep My Word".
    <br>The Apostles knew Jesus because they knew the Holy Ghost.
    <br>You know Jesus; you know the Holy Ghost.
    <br>To know Jesus is to know His Word; to love Him, keep His Word.
    <br>Jesus was not only the embodiment of the Heavenly Father but also of the Heavenly Spirit.
    <br>Note: First, He is a person. Second, He is divine.
    <br>A person has the ability to walk; the Holy Spirit walks as He wills.
    <br>In Acts 16:6-7, it says a person has the ability to decide.
    <br>"Okay."
    <br>"This one."
    <br>"Which?"
    <br>You have the ability to decide -
    <br>exercising the will through the mind; that is a person for you
    <br>but the Holy Spirit has the power of choice.
    <br>Okay, you have decided it but this is the right (one).
    <br>Absolutely!
    <br>Final - that is the Holy Spirit.
    <br>That is why people like me can be here today.
    <br>Each time you are trying to give me a wrong direction,
    <br>the Father in Heaven will say, "No, don't follow that direction; this is the direction".
    <br>Each time you are trying to give me a rumour, "Man of God, this is what has happened!",
    <br>I'm a good listener; I will listen to you.
    <br>By the time I have listened to you, you have said it...
    <br>Absolutely, the Holy Spirit is there to say, "No, what they are saying, it is not like that. This is the way".
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>He is Lord Amen
    <br>That is all!
    <br>He has risen from the dead
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>Every knee shall bow
    <br>Every tongue confess
    <br>That Jesus Christ is Lord
    <br>That is, that Jesus Christ is final.
    <br>A person has the ability to teach; He is the Ultimate Teacher!
    <br>In that book of John 14:26, the Holy Spirit teaches as He wills.
    <br>You can go out to witness, to testify, but He testifies, He witnesses.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>That is the question, as a Christian.
    <br>The Bible says in that book of Ephesians 5:18, Who are you as a Christian?
    <br>"Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery.
    <br>Instead, be filled with the Spirit."
    <br>This means, all Christians should be filled with the Spirit.
    <br>What is the difference between being baptised in the Spirit and being filled with the Spirit?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>If you take it to the book of Acts 13:52, Acts 4:31 and Acts 6:3.
    <br>Okay, let's take a look at Acts 4:31.
    <br>When they had prayed, the place was shaken and they were all filled with the Spirit.
    <br>In that Acts 13:52, it says, "And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit."
    <br>Back to 31.
    <br>It says, when they had prayed, the place was shaken and they were all filled with the Spirit
    <br>and spoke the Word of God boldly - with boldness.
    <br>Take note - without evidence of miraculous power.
    <br>That is a Christian - without evidence of miraculous power.
    <br>This means, we could now say,
    <br>all that are baptised in the Holy Spirit will be filled with the Holy Spirit
    <br>but all that are filled with the Holy Spirit may not be baptised in the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When one is baptised in the Holy Spirit, he is also filled with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>But one may be filled with the Holy Spirit and not be baptised in the Holy Spirit
    <br>because the baptism of the Holy Spirit will not allow your spirit to be free.
    <br>He is in total control of your spirit, has dominion of your spirit.
    <br>Man's spirit would not be free, not allowed to do his will.
    <br>But to be filled by the Spirit - there is an option; it is an optional matter.
    <br>To be filled by the Spirit, as a Christian, is an optional matter.
    <br>But to be baptised in the Spirit is total submission.
    <br>A suggestion must be given to you from the Spirit.
    <br>In every step, in every moment, a suggestion must come from the Spirit -
    <br>when one is baptised in the Holy Spirit, under complete dominion of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>But in that book of Acts when the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost,
    <br>without evidence of supernatural power.
    <br>So this is what the book of Ephesians 5:18 says there.
    <br>That all Christians must be filled by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>All Christians must be what?
    <br>[To be filled by the Holy Ghost.]
    <br>To be filled with the Holy Ghost is an optional matter - that is, leaves one with an option.
    <br>Will leave you with what? - An option.
    <br>It is a key area of the Scripture. I will take it one by one.
    <br>Because what is going on today, you can't imagine.
    <br>You don't know Christians; we don't know apostles; we don't know unbelievers again.
    <br>It is a level.
    <br>So people carry a dangerous mission today.
    <br>Once you become born again, you see people praying for people, for miracles,
    <br>praying for people for this, fasting or whatever.
    <br>The baptism of the Holy Ghost was Christ's baptism,
    <br>in the sense that no one else could administer it but Jesus alone.
    <br>No one - that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>It was wholly divine and human hands could not be used.
    <br>That is baptism of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>And all that are baptised in the Holy Ghost are filled with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>But not all that are filled with the Holy Ghost are baptised in the Holy Ghost.
    <br>I will try to demonstrate what I'm talking about.
    <br>It is like soaking a rug in water or oil
    <br>Leave it for a while.
    <br>When you now bring it out, you will see it dropping the oil.
    <br>The one that is dropping is the fullness.
    <br>To be filled with the Holy Ghost is the one dropping from this.
    <br>But the one that is soaked is that baptised one.
    <br>Baptism experience of the Holy Ghost will not leave man's spirit free.
    <br>In every step, in every moment, a suggestion must come from the Spirit.
    <br>"Go!" - suggestion must come from the Spirit to go.
    <br>But in the case of a Christian, you must be filled; there is an option.
    <br>Be filled with the Holy Ghost - this is what the Bible says. There is a difference.
    <br>Be filled with the Holy Ghost.
    <br>I have a Friend who never fails
    <br>Forevermore
    <br>Listen to that!
    <br>The Holy Ghost is to be with us forever; He is to support us forever -
    <br>another Comforter, another Helper.
    <br>Amen
    <br>Jesus never fails
    <br>Thank you. Did you listen to what Jesus said?
    <br>He said, "I will not leave you as an orphan".
    <br>But if you step aside, it gives the supernatural Guest a chance,
    <br>"Ok, take over. But I will be there".
    <br>What are you doing with your supernatural Guest?
    <br>Didn't you hear what the Bible says?
    <br>The Holy Spirit is not known, not received by everyone - only those who prepare for Him.
    <br>Are you?
    <br>You know Jesus; you know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Apostles knew Jesus; they knew the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You know Jesus; you know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Apostles knew Jesus; they knew the Holy Ghost.
