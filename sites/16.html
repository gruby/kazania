    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>People of God, we church people should not be concerned with how many members are in church
    <br>but how many have been saved.
    <br>Here is Mr Enny, pretending to be a Christian
    <br>but is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
    <br>What is his mission here among the people of God?
    <br>Can darkness be in the midst of light?
    <br>No!
    <br>Capital no!
    <br>Look at Mr Enny praying.
    <br>Who is he praying to?
    <br>There is prayer and there are prayers.
    <br>There is fasting and there are fastings.
    <br>Where there is no Spirit of God, he will likely pretend to be among and carry out evil.
    <br>This is why the Bible states clearly that we should watch and pray.
    <br>See how the wheat was separated from the chaff.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel, moving under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>encounters Mr Enny wearing a fine white native and spectacles.
    <br>Immediately, the spectacles are removed.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel continues with the deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Mr Enny's reaction shows early signs of demonic activity.
    <br>Mr Enny tries to deceive and mislead the Wise Man,
    <br>giving gestures that he is okay.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for delivering me!
    <br>But Wise Man Daniel is not convinced by Mr Enny's deception
    <br>and never gives up praying for him in Jesus' name.
    <br>This time, the deliverance has gone to another level,
    <br>gradually exposing the man's real spiritual nature.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel offers spirit-filled prayer
    <br>in order to uproot every power of darkness in Mr Enny's life.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Fire on your back!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus! All over your body right now!
    <br>Fire on your clothes! Fire from your head to your toes!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus! All over your body!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire all over your body, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>All over your body - fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire all over your body!
    <br>It's a snake!
    <br>As the deliverance continues in The SCOAN,
    <br>the fire of the Holy Ghost forces the demons to show their real colours.
    <br>The man's movements continuously change
    <br>as the different demons possessing him manifest their own diabolic characteristics and actions.
    <br>The fire is getting too much
    <br>and the man tears his native top out of frustration and much agitation.
    <br>He begins to spit out poisonous saliva - a demonic attack.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>On your back!
    <br>On your back, snake!
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Wise Man Daniel continues to call down the fire of the Holy Ghost
    <br>to consume every atom of darkness in his spirit, soul and body.
    <br>The man tosses, turns and spins -
    <br>actions that express that he is not at ease with himself
    <br>as he undergoes the deliverance.
    <br>Satan is powerless in the face of God's armour and weapons.
    <br>The man tears his pants to pieces
    <br>as the fire of the Holy Ghost continues to descend upon him.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>He then quickly reacts, getting off the ground in an attempt to put on his shoes.
    <br>But Wise Man Daniel pours the light of God on his shoes,
    <br>sending the demonic spirit inside the man running.
    <br>He tries to escape making animal-like movements down the side of the church
    <br>before coming to a complete standstill.
    <br>The demons inside of the man are in total disarray.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Satan is powerless in the face of God's armour and weapons.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel commands the man to go back to where he was, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Remember, the child of God was created to be master over every power of darkness in the world
    <br>whether it manifested itself in the form of creatures that move in the air, on the ground or in the sea.
    <br>He was created to be master over them.
    <br>One of the demons possessing the man poses in its diabolic posture
    <br>and looks around for where it can attack.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel commands the man in the name of Jesus Christ to go down the stairs.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>And is eventually brought down to his knees.
    <br>The demons inside the man are in complete disarray,
    <br>realising that its powers are no match for the name Jesus Christ.
    <br>He begins to look for a way of escape and peeps down the stairwell
    <br>to try and flee from the Wise Man - a sign of defeat.
    <br>In desperation he reaches out his hand down the gap but there is no chance.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel swiftly puts the man back in his place.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>You are hiding T.B. Joshua from me.
    <br>I will blind his eyes.
    <br>If Idigun cannot do it, I, the queen, will do it.
    <br>I will blind you.
    <br>You will do what?
    <br>I will blind you.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>The wicked and demonic nature of the man continues to be uprooted
    <br>as he slithers on the ground before launching saliva at the cameramen
    <br>that have now gathered at the scene.
    <br>He then straightens and manifests into another demon.
    <br>Nothing seems to be working.
    <br>He makes yet another attempt to run away from the Wise Man.
    <br>This time launching up and over the wall and onto the gallery.
    <br>Come back here!
    <br>But Wise Man Daniel commands the man to come back.
    <br>The man under the influence of evil spirits slithers on the ground,
    <br>in complete confusion looking around the auditorium.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the light of the world.
    <br>Whoever follows Him will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.
    <br>The man yet again emits out of his mouth poisonous saliva.
    <br>Stop that!
    <br>Jesus is more than you!
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>And it scatters all over the ground.
    <br>At the mention of the name Jesus Christ, every demon shall bow.
    <br>The man moves off the ground.
    <br>The deliverance arena has been cleared
    <br>and Wise Man Daniel leads the way out for this spiritual combat
    <br>to be fought in the main auditorium.
    <br>All systems are "go!" and the battle begins.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Prophetic and Deliverance Service
    <br>You said you are who?
    <br>Speak, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>I am Idigun (god of iron).
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>Come back here! What have you done to him?
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Stop that!
    <br>What have you done to him? Speak!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am Idigun (god of iron).
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Is it the Idigun or what? The queen?
    <br>You are who?
    <br>I am the queen.
    <br>I am Idigun.
    <br>Ok. What have you done to him?
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>How did you enter him?
    <br>The queen can never speak.
    <br>How did you enter this body?
    <br>But Idigun wants to speak.
    <br>Speak. How did you enter this body?
    <br>It was because of me that he came out.
    <br>How long have you been inside him and how did you enter him?
    <br>How long have I been in him?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>How long have I been in him?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>They begged me for him to come out.
    <br>How?
    <br>Ask Martin Eboka.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>He serves me.
    <br>I'm from Delta State (Nigeria).
    <br>Who are you there?
    <br>I am Idigun (god of iron).
    <br>What do you mean by Idigun?
    <br>What do I mean by Idigun?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>What do I mean by Idigun?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What do you mean by Wise Man? What is your name, please?
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body, fire, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>The demons Idigun and queen possessing Mr Enny continue to manifest in and out,
    <br>taking turns at challenging Wise Man Daniel but all in vain.
    <br>They devise their demonic tactics and try to execute their attacks
    <br>but all proved ineffective.
    <br>The all consuming fire of the Holy Ghost is too much
    <br>and Mr Enny finds himself yet again on the floor, found wanting
    <br>after a superior beating and falls flat on his face.
    <br>After some time, he gets up and looks around the auditorium perplexed
    <br>and moves off the ground drained after much energy spent and finds a seat.
    <br>Time has run out in the Sunday service
    <br>and all other deliverances have been moved over to the Monday Live Service at The SCOAN.
    <br>Mr Enny, arrested in the power of the Holy Ghost, will have to wait for the Monday Live Service at The SCOAN
    <br>for his final and complete deliverance.
    <br>Mr Enny is given a few bottles of water to consume
    <br>after expending much energy throughout his manifestation.
    <br>Watch very carefully.
    <br>Mr Enny consumes the water in a bizarre manner,
    <br>drinking from the bottom end of the bottle.
    <br>The man was given a new set of clothes to wear
    <br>because the man completely destroyed his clothes during the manifestation and deliverance.
    <br>New Clothes Given To Mr Enny
    <br>Mr Enny Walks To The Bathroom To Wash And Change His Clothes
    <br>He makes his way to the bathroom to refresh himself
    <br>and put on a new set of clothes given to him.
    <br>Mr Enny Walks Out Of The Bathroom Wearing The New Clothes
    <br>Before dawn, Mr Enny left the church premises where he had stayed the night.
    <br>He headed to the police station to report that T.B. Joshua should be arrested.
    <br>The police recognised Mr Enny immediately from Emmanuel TV
    <br>when he was undergoing deliverance and rejected his request.
    <br>Annoyed, Mr Enny went to reinforce his diabolical power.
    <br>Equipped, he came back to the church with a black plastic bag.
    <br>Upon getting to the gate, he was stopped by security
    <br>who wouldn't allow him to enter without showing them the contents of his bag.
    <br>To their greatest surprise, they discovered a live chicken.
    <br>Let's watch to find out what happened next.
    <br>Here is Mr Enny returning to The SCOAN auditorium
    <br>after escaping the church grounds during the night.
    <br>He brought back with him a plastic bag containing all kinds of diabolic items and materials.
    <br>The security would not allow him to enter without showing them the contents.
    <br>He takes a live chicken out of the bag and hides it under his arm.
    <br>Where did Mr Enny go during the night and what is the live chicken for?
    <br>Let's find out.
    <br>I went to report to the police station but they refused to follow me here.
    <br>They said that they cannot arrest T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Why? Is there anybody that is above the law?
    <br>Bring your nylon bag.
    <br>He then brings out of a plastic bag a live chicken
    <br>and rips off its head with his mouth.
    <br>before spreading the blood all over his head and tossing it on the ground.
    <br>Blood gushes out of the chicken as it continues moving around without its head.
    <br>What could be going through his mind?
    <br>I don't know. But for someone to bite off a live chicken's head like that,
    <br>something is not right.
    <br>Yes, that is not normal.
    <br>Let's see who this man really is.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Fine.
    <br>Where have you been? I've been looking for you since yesterday. Where did you go?
    <br>You people have been toying me around so I went to report to the police station.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Just outside The SCOAN's auditorium,
    <br>Wise Man Daniel ministers prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit in Jesus' name
    <br>and the final battle is under way.
    <br>Immediately, Mr Enny begins to feel the fire of the Holy Ghost burning him
    <br>and he jumps out of his seat
    <br>and walks over to where he kept a plastic bag filled with demonic items.
    <br>He reaches into the plastic bag
    <br>and brings out the chicken he sacrificed earlier
    <br>and spreads the blood over his head.
    <br>Mr Enny implements a diabolic method to gain more evil power to challenge the Wise Man.
    <br>The name Jesus Christ is more powerful than all the combined forces of hell and earth.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel, not deterred by his diabolic method,
    <br>continues fervently praying in the power of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and sends the evil spirit in the man jolting in circles and climbing up the wall.
    <br>Mr Enny makes an effort to charge himself up, bouncing and dancing,
    <br>and even hopping up and down the wall to employ another demonic power boost
    <br>but Wise Man Daniel is quick to disable it in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Come down.
    <br>Jesus is more than you. Come down.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>All over your body.
    <br>Mr Enny is frustrated, wondering why the sacrificed chicken blood is not working.
    <br>He sprints over to the sacrificed fowl to apply more of its blood over his head
    <br>in order to enhance and maximise his demonic power in the spirit realm.
    <br>Mr Enny demonically empowered moves over to challenge the Wise Man once again
    <br>and begins to attack.
    <br>It fails miserably, and he finds himself mesmerised and disappointed.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel counteracts, using his foot as a point of contact for the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Fire, on your shirt, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Wise Man Daniel continues commanding the fire of the Holy Ghost over Mr Enny,
    <br>and the demons possessing him begin to burn in an inferno of heat.
    <br>The heat is unbearable for Mr Enny
    <br>as he carries on fidgeting, twitching and moving about restlessly.
    <br>Another demon is exposed in Mr Enny
    <br>as Wise Man Daniel continues praying without ceasing.
    <br>You, python, move, in Jesus' name!
    <br>The spirit of python is uprooted and begins slithering and rolling on the floor
    <br>and then manifests and springs up from the ground into another demon.
    <br>You can see the way he has fixed himself into a sitting position
    <br>with his two hands molded together.
    <br>Yet again another demon manifests in Mr Enny and parades about.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel continues casting fire on him in Jesus' name.
    <br>The victory is closing in as Mr Enny lays flat on the floor,
    <br>slithering like a python on its back.
    <br>The battle between the stone and the water - in time, the water wins.
    <br>Let's watch intently at what happens next.
    <br>I will talk!
    <br>I am an oracle of Idigun.
    <br>I am Idigun.
    <br>Your back on the floor, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I will talk!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am Idigun.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>The senior brother to the father,
    <br>when the mother was pregnant, they came to me.
    <br>The woman could not deliver; she was at the point of dying.
    <br>Martin Eboka begged and pleaded with me and I agreed with his plea.
    <br>I gave him my water and immediately, after he gave it to the mother of this boy,
    <br>she gave birth to this boy and gave him into my hand.
    <br>What have you been doing in the life of this boy?
    <br>I will talk!
    <br>Speak!
    <br>I will talk!
    <br>Martin could not maintain the oracle anymore.
    <br>I said, "Okay, let me walk into this boy".
    <br>I've been protecting him.
    <br>No danger will harm him.
    <br>But he is mine.
    <br>He is what?
    <br>He is mine.
    <br>He is yours?
    <br>Yes, he is mine.
    <br>Since you've been living inside of him, what have you done to the family, as an oracle?
    <br>My annoyance was the queen, who also came to drag the body with me.
    <br>Later, I agreed but before then the father suffered.
    <br>There is no sickness that this boy did not experience.
    <br>I will talk.
    <br>How many of you are living inside him?
    <br>We are two.
    <br>Mention them.
    <br>Idigun, the oracle, and the queen of all queens.
    <br>And the queen of all queens. The queen of where?
    <br>The queen of all queens, the queen of the coast.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>I will talk.
    <br>If I leave this boy alone, where will I go?
    <br>No!
    <br>I, Idigun? Go for who? No!
    <br>I am Idigun.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>What do you want from me?
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Why would I leave him?
    <br>Twenty-seven years ago, he was born into my hand.
    <br>What do you mean? Tell me.
    <br>He is my son.
    <br>I brought him to this world.
    <br>This is my world.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>You don't have money but he has money - he is a big boy.
    <br>I'm a big boy!
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, out of this body!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I brought him to this world.
    <br>No one can touch him, no one can handle him and no one can stand him.
    <br>Yes, it is me.
    <br>He gets what he wants.
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>The oracle Idigun that possessed Mr Enny for twenty-seven years began to talk,
    <br>confessing that the father gave the mother and the boy to him.
    <br>Later, the oracle Idigun entered into the boy, along with another demon -
    <br>the queen of the coast.
    <br>Urine pours out of Mr Enny as the fire of the Holy Ghost continues to torture the demons,
    <br>signalling that the deliverance is almost complete.
    <br>Do you think you can do away with the oracle?
    <br>You are going out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>It's me, the queen.
    <br>The oracle has gone. It remains you, queen; you are going.
    <br>Out, in the might name of Jesus!
    <br>The oracle Idigun is out and there is urine all over the floor.
    <br>Holy Ghost fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>The oracle Idigun that had possessed Mr Enny for twenty-seven years is out
    <br>and the queen speaks out of Mr Enny, saying, "It is only the queen remaining".
    <br>The queen of the coast is now in complete control of Mr Enny
    <br>and parades about in its final attempt to take on the Wise Man.
    <br>The queen prances around the Wise Man but is suddenly stopped.
    <br>Mr Enny stretches out his hand to attack but is unable to
    <br>and continues again parading around the Wise Man.
    <br>The queen attempted a demonic attack but it fails miserably.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>All over your body - fire!
    <br>It is now tamed on the ground.
    <br>The demon continues manifesting, moving its tongue like a snake
    <br>and once again slithers on the ground.
    <br>It lays on its back exhausted from the battle.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>I will get him!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>I will get him!
    <br>Go!
    <br>The queen of the coast that still remains inside Mr Enny is on its final legs.
    <br>Mr Enny brawls and struggles desperately around on the ground
    <br>and attempts a final attack but it doesn't work and has now run out of options
    <br>as it lays defeated on the ground.
    <br>Out!
    <br>Come out of this body!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord Jesus, for this deliverance.
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name, you are declared free.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Stand up; you are free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>My friend, come!
    <br>Turn off this camera!
    <br>Don't worry. Come - you're my friend.
    <br>Don't worry; you are free!
    <br>I'm okay.
    <br>You are free. How are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>Why are you like this?
    <br>Turn off the light; I'm ashamed.
    <br>Look at me; I'm dirty.
    <br>You are what?
    <br>I'm dirty.
    <br>You are dirty?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You don't know what happened to you?
    <br>People are surrounding me. I'm ashamed.
    <br>You don't know them?
    <br>No, I don't know them.
    <br>But you came to church here.
    <br>My eyes are turning.
    <br>Your eyes are turning? Do you need some rest?
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>I'm weak.
    <br>You don't know what happened to you?
    <br>I'm weak.
    <br>Do you know what happened to you?
    <br>Nothing is in me; everything is out.
    <br>I'm weak.
    <br>You are weak?
    <br>I'm weak.
    <br>Come; let me show you something.
    <br>Who brought these things?
    <br>Who brought this fowl?
    <br>Yes. Who brought it?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>You're not the one who brought it?
    <br>Me? No.
    <br>I'm not the one.
    <br>You're not the one?
    <br>I don't know anything about the fowl.
    <br>You don't know anything about it?
    <br>No, I don't know anything about the fowl.
    <br>But you're the one who brought this.
    <br>No.
    <br>You used your mouth to cut the head off of the live fowl.
    <br>No! Are you laying an allegation on me?
    <br>So, you are not the one who used your mouth to cut it?
    <br>No, I did not do anything like that.
    <br>It is funny.
    <br>You are delivered.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I'm free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I'm delivered!
    <br>I'm not heavy anymore! I'm light!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ! I'm free!
    <br>After the deliverance, the chicken Mr Enny sacrificed to gain diabolical power was burnt.
    <br>Watch what happened during the burning of the chicken.
    <br>Mr Enny Carries The Black Bag Containing The Dead Chicken
    <br>Mr Enny appears from out of the bush
    <br>where he had left the black plastic bag that contained the chicken that he formerly sacrificed
    <br>to enhance and maximise his diabolical powers
    <br>when he was under the influence and control of demonic spirits.
    <br>Mr Enny then pours kerosine all over the dead chicken
    <br>and then draws out a match, lights it quickly and then tosses it on the kerosine.
    <br>Immediately, the sacrificed chicken caught on fire and burst into flames.
    <br>Something unusual happens: Mr Enny somersaults away from the bonfire
    <br>and lays stagnant on the ground.
    <br>What could have forced Mr Enny to have somersaulted like that onto the ground?
    <br>Mr Enny slowly gets up from the ground and looks around.
    <br>He appears to be in a state of shock.
    <br>Is Mr Enny okay or has something happened?
    <br>The sacrificed chicken continues to roast in flames.
    <br>Mr Enny stares intensely into the fire in a deep state of sober reflection.
    <br>The evangelist wakes Mr Enny up from his deep concentration
    <br>and likely asks Mr Enny about his condition.
    <br>Another evangelist notices Mr Enny's unusual behaviour
    <br>This man says he cannot hear us.
    <br>Talk louder.
    <br>Mr Enny tries to signal with his hands that he has become deaf and dumb.
    <br>Mr Enny, we saw that the moment you burnt the chicken you were using before as a sacrifice,
    <br>you began to roll all over the ground. What happened?
    <br>You fell down - what happened?
    <br>The interview confirms that a deaf and dumb spirit has entered Mr Enny,
    <br>and he is now unable to hear or speak.
    <br>So you cannot hear at all what I am saying? You cannot hear me?
    <br>Mr Enny Is Not Able To Hear Or Speak
    <br>So it is very clear that our brother cannot hear or talk right now
    <br>after burning the chicken he had been using before as sacrifice.
    <br>But we thank God Almighty that God Almighty is in complete control of the situation
    <br>and his voice and hearing will be restored so that he will be able to expose to the world exactly
    <br>how he has been using these evil powers and demonic spirits.
    <br>Viewers around the world, stay with us.
    <br>We are going to hear from him and hear his confession very shortly
    <br>after God Almighty sets him free from this spirit that causes him right now
    <br>not to be able to speak, talk or listen.
    <br>Mr Enny is then taken to meet with Wise Man Daniel
    <br>for healing and deliverance in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's watch what happens.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Your voice - how are you?
    <br>Speak out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Jesus wants to hear your voice. How are you?
    <br>How are you? Speak!
    <br>You can hear me; I want to hear you. Speak!
    <br>How are you?
    <br>How are you?
    <br>How are you?
    <br>You, deaf and dumb spirit, I declare you out!
    <br>Out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>You, deaf and dumb spirit, come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Leave this body!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, you deaf and dumb spirit, come out!
    <br>You deaf and dumb spirit, come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Jesus wants you out.
    <br>Come out, you, deaf and dumb spirit!
    <br>Wise Man Daniel commands the deaf and dumb spirit that entered Mr Enny
    <br>when he set the sacrificed chicken on fire.
    <br>You can see the evil spirit manifesting in Mr Enny's body
    <br>as he repeatedly spins in circles on the floor.
    <br>The deaf and dumb spirit struggles to stay connected to Mr Enny
    <br>as the fire of the Holy Ghost continues to descend upon it.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>As the evil spirit finally loses its grip upon Mr Enny,
    <br>let's see Mr Enny's condition now after the prayer in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel uncovers the plastic from the Anointing Water
    <br>and prepares to minister it to Mr Enny for healing, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel Ministers The Anointing Water To Mr Enny
    <br>Sit upright.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Mr Enny is set free and commanded to rise to his feet.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Fine, sir.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>My name is Enny Eboka.
    <br>You're fine?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Thank Jesus. God bless you.
    <br>What happened to you that you were not able to talk?
    <br>I could not talk. It is just that...
    <br>Something came and hooked me on my neck.
    <br>It was as if I swallowed a lot of smoke.
    <br>That was why you could not talk?
    <br>I did not hear you.
    <br>You could not hear me?
    <br>But I can hear you now.
    <br>You can hear me now?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You can talk now?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>But before now?
    <br>I could not speak before.
    <br>Where did you see the smoke?
    <br>They said I should pour fuel on the fowl.
    <br>After I poured the fuel, they gave me matches.
    <br>As I lit it, the fire caught immediately.
    <br>As it caught fire, I swallowed smoke.
    <br>After that time, what happened to you?
    <br>I fell down; I was not myself.
    <br>The smoke was hurting me inside my chest, in my ears and in my hand.
    <br>It was as if I had hit it on something and it was stiff.
    <br>How are you feeling now?
    <br>Now, I'm fine.
    <br>Thank Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus; I'm healed!
    <br>I can talk now; I can hear you now!
    <br>I can hear anything you want to say now.
    <br>I can hear you; I can speak fine now.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>After watching the clips of how he received his deliverance from the satanic kingdom
    <br>and demonic activity he had been involved in for so many years,
    <br>Mr Enny is overwhelmed by emotion and his eyes are filled with tears -
    <br>a sign of remorse for the life he once lived.
    <br>Let's listen as he shares how Jesus Christ took him out of the satanic kingdom of darkness
    <br>and into the kingdom of light.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>King of kings and Lord of lords, I bow down before You.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Enny Eboka.
    <br>I'm from Delta State (Nigeria).
    <br>Here is my dad.
    <br>Here is the senior brother to my dad.
    <br>Here is my stepmother.
    <br>Here is my sister.
    <br>This is my cousin.
    <br>Here are my younger sisters.
    <br>After my deliverance, I began to pray and study the Word of God
    <br>seriously in the morning and at night.
    <br>The Word of God made me to know that
    <br>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom.
    <br>I have come to realise...
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>With what he is doing now also shows that really, satan is a liar.
    <br>God has a great promise in the life of this boy.
    <br>He is crying because he can't imagine what he has done. Ok, let's listen.
    <br>1 Peter 5:8 says, "Be self-controlled and alert
    <br>for the devil roams as a roaring lion looking for whom to devour".
    <br>I will disgrace the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>After my deliverance, I realised the definition of satan.
    <br>Satan can be defined as "your mistake".
    <br>God wants the best for you, while the devil goes for the best.
    <br>Have it in mind that satan does not miss an opportunity.
    <br>Have it also in mind that your temptation comes from the most precious thing you love.
    <br>So, do not love anything on earth or take it so precious.
    <br>Do not start a journey that you cannot end; otherwise, that journey will end you.
    <br>Double-mindedness kills.
    <br>Problems are good to be shared with those who have a solution
    <br>and not with those who will look for a solution.
    <br>Rich or poor, sleep like a visitor to live long.
    <br>The poor should speak like a rich man
    <br>for any word that comes out of your mouth is a secret of whom you are already,
    <br>while the rich should speak like a poor man
    <br>because any rich man that speaks according to his riches is a naked man
    <br>for the world of a rich man stands as a key to his door
    <br>but when a rich man speaks like a rich man, he has dug his six feet.
    <br>Be proud of your unfavourable condition because it is your weak point.
    <br>When I was a little boy, my uncle, the senior brother to my dad told me
    <br>that when my mum was pregnant,
    <br>my dad told my mum to come down to his house in Nsukka, Enugu State,
    <br>It was the first experience for both my mum and dad, so they were scared
    <br>because the pregnancy was overdue.
    <br>My mum came to my uncle for help, for a solution because
    <br>he was more experienced than them.
    <br>Then, my uncle was serving an oracle called Idigwu (god of iron).
    <br>He depended on Idigwu, the oracle, god of iron.
    <br>He met the oracle because, according to my uncle, my mum's colour changed
    <br>as if she had no blood in her body and wanted to die.
    <br>My uncle met the oracle and spoke to it.
    <br>Oracle, since I have been serving you, you have never put me to shame.
    <br>I have been serving you well.
    <br>Today would not be the first time that shame would weigh me down.
    <br>Idigwu, you know that this woman is the wife of my younger brother
    <br>which means the wife of my younger brother is my wife as well.
    <br>Anything that belongs to me belongs to you, Idigwu, the oracle, god of iron.
    <br>Please, help me that this woman will have a safe delivery and that she will deliver fast
    <br>That was the eleventh month that my mum was pregnant.
    <br>Then, he put his hand in the oracle
    <br>and brought out water from Idigwu, the oracle, god of iron.
    <br>He brought out the water and gave it to my mum.
    <br>When my mum drank the water, it was not long before she fell into labour.
    <br>Before you knew what happened, my mum delivered me -
    <br>the one standing here, Enny Eboka.
    <br>From that time, I began to imagine strange things about myself.
    <br>When I was in school, I beat people who were far older than me - my seniors.
    <br>I was six, seven years old then but I beat big people
    <br>because of that strange power in me; I had a very strong power.
    <br>That devilish mark in me took me to anywhere I could meet with the same devilish things.
    <br>There was a festival around my father's house; I attended that festival.
    <br>After the dancing, they shared food and drinks; I ate.
    <br>It was the old women there who shared the food and drinks; I ate.
    <br>When I came back home and slept, I found myself in another world.
    <br>In that world, people lived upside down.
    <br>They used their heads to walk; their legs were up and their heads were down.
    <br>We were marching on top of people; they used people as rugs or carpets.
    <br>Even where we sat as new members,
    <br>we were sitting on top of people, human beings lying down all over.
    <br>It was human beings they used as rugs over there.
    <br>We all had one head each but the king had eight heads upside down.
    <br>We were all upside down.
    <br>The king had eight heads.
    <br>Everything they were doing there was very strange to us, the new people.
    <br>They were dancing and jubilating.
    <br>After everything, they began to share human being flesh blood to us.
    <br>When they came to me to give me the blood, I resisted and was stubborn.
    <br>They dealt with me; I was forced to take the blood.
    <br>Immediately after I took the blood, I began to understand the language they spoke.
    <br>Everything they did there was no longer strange to me.
    <br>In the physical, I was six, seven years old then but in there, I was over forty years old.
    <br>While I was inside that kingdom, there was nothing like an old or small person.
    <br>Everybody was mature in that kingdom.
    <br>After they shared the blood with us and I drank,
    <br>the king brought out a very big record book
    <br>and began to call out names of the people over there in that language
    <br>that I could understand then because of the blood I took.
    <br>He began to call 50 names in number.
    <br>After he called 50 people out, he began to call them in groups of five.
    <br>He would first of all call out five and send them,
    <br>"Go to the highways to cause accidents,
    <br>so that you can get fresh blood which I will use tonight".
    <br>The five people would disappear.
    <br>The way we would disappear was we would gather our two hands,
    <br>fix it like this and disappear.
    <br>They called the second set of people out and said,
    <br>"We are sending you to schools.
    <br>Go to schools, win souls for me, bring students for me, share things and
    <br>attract members; I want members from schools".
    <br>The five of them would leave; they disappeared in the same way.
    <br>They called another set of people to go to hospitals.
    <br>He instructed two of those five people,
    <br>"Two people, your work is to cause miscarriages; bring new-born babies to my kingdom.
    <br>Later, they will come to me to ask for a child.
    <br>You, the remaining three people,
    <br>go and bring the doctors, nurses and workers in that hospital,
    <br>so that I will initiate them and send them back to the hospital and
    <br>they can initiate more people for me".
    <br>All these people were groups of five as they were sent out.
    <br>But when they called out another group, they called a group of 10.
    <br>They said, "These ten people, you will go to churches".
    <br>The church was the place to which they sent the highest number of people.
    <br>He said, "You, ten people, go to the church, cause confusion
    <br>and win souls - the pastors, ushers and the workers in the church.
    <br>Cause sleeping and distraction.
    <br>Bring souls to my kingdom so that I will initiate them
    <br>and send them back to the church to win more people,
    <br>to initiate more souls for me".
    <br>After everything, they would leave.
    <br>The first assignment that was given to me was to act as a beggar.
    <br>We were five; when they called the five of us out, they sent me to go out,
    <br>"Go and act as a beggar and initiate people; bring them to my kingdom".
    <br>I moved up and went to the dressing room.
    <br>If they assigned you for anything, you had to go to the dressing room
    <br>to disguise for that mission they sent you for.
    <br>When they sent me to go and act as a beggar and initiate people,
    <br>I stood up and went to the dressing room.
    <br>When I got to the dressing room, they asked me what my mission was.
    <br>I told them that my mission was to initiate people by begging.
    <br>He said that I should wait, that he was coming back.
    <br>He entered and brought clothes.
    <br>That cloth only had one eye and was for a crippled person.
    <br>The way you would appear on earth
    <br>would determine the type of clothes they would give you there.
    <br>If they gave you clothes with one sleeve and two legs,
    <br>when you wore the clothes, disappeared and found yourself in the world,
    <br>you would have one hand and two legs.
    <br>If they gave you clothes for a complete body but it was for a very big tummy,
    <br>when you saw yourself in the world, your body would be complete
    <br>but your belly would be very big as if you had an illness.
    <br>They sent me. It was any place I wished to go to that I would disappear to.
    <br>I would go to a place that was very crowded.
    <br>I would meet a very large number of people at bus stops, garages, parks
    <br>and anywhere where I could initiate many people.
    <br>I disappeared, entered and sat down as what they sent me.
    <br>I would see people walking.
    <br>Anybody with a flame of fire around them would never have pity on me
    <br>and give me money; the person would just pass.
    <br>The flame of fire means the real Christian, not Christians by mouth.
    <br>I mean, the real Christian.
    <br>The real Christian would never give me because
    <br>a real Christian has a flame of fire controlling the spirit being in him.
    <br>But when the flame of fire around you is not high,
    <br>that is when you argue with the spirit being in you.
    <br>When the Spirit says, "Move out from here",
    <br>you will bring your own suggestion - "let me still stay for five minutes".
    <br>That five minutes will be the time that something critical will happen to you.
    <br>That shows that you are not a Christian.
    <br>Anytime anybody who did not have a flame of fire passed around me,
    <br>he would feel sympathy and come to give me money as a beggar.
    <br>They would give and I would collect it.
    <br>That was how we kept on going.
    <br>If anybody without a flame of fire passed around,
    <br>he would contribute and help me; he would have pity on me.
    <br>After everything, I would gather my two hands, put them on my private part
    <br>and find myself in the kingdom.
    <br>There was a satellite in the kingdom which showed every activity you did.
    <br>When I got to the kingdom, I took all the money they gave to me and gave it to the king.
    <br>Immediately after I gave it to the king, he congratulated me
    <br>and my rank came up a bit as a first attempt.
    <br>That money I gave to the king,
    <br>the king would use it to welcome those people in their dreams
    <br>and initiate them the same way I was initiated the first day I entered.
    <br>The second mission they sent me on was to act as a wheelbarrow pusher.
    <br>In that market, anybody who did not have that flame of fire
    <br>would want me to help them to carry their luggage
    <br>to where they would enter a bus, a bike or whatever.
    <br>It kept on happening like that.
    <br>After everything, I would go back to my kingdom.
    <br>The third assignment was to go to church.
    <br>They called me and said, "You're going to church to seduce church members".
    <br>That was my third one and when I succeeded in it, it increased my rank.
    <br>They said I was going to seduce people in the church.
    <br>I went to the dressing room and they asked me of my mission.
    <br>I said my mission was to seduce in the church.
    <br>They told me to wait and then brought me clothes with a very strong perfume.
    <br>I wore it, placed my two hands on my private part and entered the church.
    <br>This was what I had been doing - going around all the churches in Nigeria.
    <br>I had been going to different churches.
    <br>That was just my mission and that increased my rank.
    <br>When I wore those clothes and I was inside the church,
    <br>if you did not have that flame of fire,
    <br>you would smell the odour of the perfume.
    <br>Immediately you smelt that perfume, you must ask me one question or another.
    <br>You may ask me, "Please, brother, don't be offended. What is the time?"
    <br>I would say that the time was 2pm or 12pm. Already, I initiated you.
    <br>I would still stay longer.
    <br>Anybody that did not have that flame of fire around him,
    <br>immediately you must smell the odour of the perfume and ask me something.
    <br>You would say, "Brother, don't be offended. Let me use your pen to jot down a Scripture".
    <br>I would say, "Okay, no problem", and give you the pen.
    <br>You might ask me, "Brother, don't be offended. I love your shoes.
    <br>Can you tell me where you bought them?"
    <br>I would ask for the phone and give them the number of the person I bought the shoes from.
    <br>This was how I kept going around, especially to big churches because
    <br>we who were in the spiritual kingdom of the devil would go for the best.
    <br>That was why we would go for the big churches.
    <br>I didn't go for all those churches that were not recognised.
    <br>I liked going for the big churches because that was where I could increase my rank.
    <br>I used to pay a huge amount in tithes. With those tithes, I initiated more people.
    <br>When I paid my tithe and offering, a very huge amount, after I had left,
    <br>whosoever touched the tithes, counted the offering or had anything to do with it
    <br>must come to the kingdom, be welcomed and initiated.
    <br>But after the initiation, the king did not retain them in that kingdom.
    <br>He would still send them back to the same church to act in the same position
    <br>as a pastor or usher, attending to people.
    <br>That will now stand as a key to initiate more people in the church.
    <br>That is why in the house of God today, we especially use the pastors, ushers
    <br>and other workers in the church to initiate people into our kingdom.
    <br>This was how I kept on going here and there.
    <br>But then, as all these things were going on, I kept on doing this sacrifice,
    <br>a strange thing, to Idigwu, the god of iron.
    <br>Anytime that power came upon me,
    <br>I would feel angry and controlled immediately.
    <br>My dad loved training pigeons; he had so many pigeons.
    <br>I used to move secretly to where he trained the pigeons and catch one.
    <br>I would take the pigeon to any secret place, especially where there was a river,
    <br>so that I could take my bath after the sacrifice.
    <br>I would use my hands to squeeze the pigeon and immediately turn it over my head,
    <br>just for that blood to gush on it.
    <br>Immediately that blood would pour on my head, I would regain myself and be okay.
    <br>But if I did not do that immediately, I would be acting stupidly and strangely.
    <br>I would not be myself.
    <br>I stole both fowls and pigeons, anything that came near to me which had blood.
    <br>When I got to the river, I would remove my clothes, pour the blood on my head
    <br>and afterwards, enter the river and swim. After this, I would return to normal.
    <br>Sometimes, my dad would see the feathers of a fowl or pigeon all over and ask
    <br>what was happening to his pigeons that he saw feathers everywhere.
    <br>I would say it was cats that came to catch the pigeons and he just took it like that,
    <br>but he did not know that I was really the one doing it.
    <br>So, one day, another strange thing happened to me.
    <br>As that urge came upon me, I went to catch a fowl and took it to the river.
    <br>As I normally did the sacrifice, I squeezed the pigeon's head and used the blood on my head.
    <br>As I was doing it, I regained myself and was okay.
    <br>I then entered inside the river, just as I normally always did.
    <br>Immediately I entered, I saw someone on top of the river, a very beautiful lady.
    <br>When I saw that beautiful lady, I was inside the river from my waist down.
    <br>That beautiful lady that I saw, her waist was also inside the river
    <br>while from her waist up, she was outside the river.
    <br>I began to feel something automatically then - my manhood became erect.
    <br>Immediately after erecting, I discharged into the water.
    <br>Immediately after this happened, it was like water entered into my nose.
    <br>I began struggling, the water entered my brain and it seemed as if I fainted.
    <br>After a short time, I suddenly realised I was inside the water and jumped up from the water.
    <br>I was confused.
    <br>I then found a place by the river to lie down and slept.
    <br>I then saw in a dream the same beautiful lady on the river sleeping with me.
    <br>That was how I was possessed by the queen of the coast, the queen of all queens.
    <br>That was how that came to possess me, apart from Idigwu, the oracle, the god of iron.
    <br>Then, because my rank became higher, I didn't like staying inside the house or around the house anymore.
    <br>I loved climbing on top of trees, the tallest trees near our compound.
    <br>I would climb to the top and sleep there.
    <br>Once I slept there, I would be in our kingdom.
    <br>I would be there, playing, having fun and eating very good food.
    <br>After everything, I would come down from the tree.
    <br>But one certain time, my dad discovered this and anytime he caught me,
    <br>he would flog me. My dad didn't flog me with a cane but with a big electric wire
    <br>because he knew that I was very strong.
    <br>When my dad kept doing this and took me to church, the kingdom became angry
    <br>and attacked my father.
    <br>They said, "Since you want to stand and you don't want to allow your son to serve us,
    <br>your business will not prosper anymore".
    <br>They tackled my father.
    <br>The condition he is in today is a result of what I caused him.
    <br>My father was into telecommunications but because of this,
    <br>there were no more calls for his services in bringing equipment or radio messages.
    <br>Everything ceased.
    <br>If I was in the house, we would find it difficult to eat
    <br>and when I went out, I would be hungry.
    <br>I would manage to eat the fried corn and unripe pawpaw.
    <br>So, if I was hungry, I would go to the kingdom and eat very nice food there.
    <br>Any time I did not have money, that anger would come upon me;
    <br>I would be very aggressive.
    <br>I would come out to the bank or road.
    <br>If I looked at you and you're shining, I'd know you're with my money.
    <br>I would walk to you, touch you and say, "Give me my money"
    <br>and you would give me the money in the nylon bag immediately.
    <br>I would say, "Go", and the person would move.
    <br>I did not work or do anything for a living but I lived flamboyantly.
    <br>I would buy a car today; before two weeks passed, I would sell it again.
    <br>I lived flamboyantly and won souls by spending money on people.
    <br>If I spent money on you or gave you money, that was how I initiated people.
    <br>That was my duty - going to churches around, paying tithes,
    <br>helping people and winning souls all over Nigeria,
    <br>just for me to be the king of all, all over Nigeria. That was why I did that.
    <br>I initiated millions of people; you would see them being handcuffed.
    <br>I killed people with my hands.
    <br>I had the power to command human beings;
    <br>if I needed money and I met you, I would say, "Give me my money",
    <br>and you would give it to me.
    <br>Even if you were inside your car, if I knocked the car and said,
    <br>"Mister, wind down", you would wind down and give me my money.
    <br>Sometimes, when I entered the bank
    <br>and saw you withdrawing a huge amount of money to put in a nylon bag
    <br>but you would not shine because there was a flame around you,
    <br>I knew that for some people, not all, if I saw that flame of fire around you,
    <br>you would not shine, meaning that it was not my money.
    <br>If I went to touch such a person, I would receive embarassment.
    <br>But when I saw you shining, either you or your car,
    <br>I would know it was my money. I would walk straight up to you in the bank,
    <br>touch you and say, "Mister, give me my money".
    <br>After giving me my money, I would hold it and say you could go out.
    <br>After you would have gone out, then I would walk out majestically from the bank.
    <br>Let's just go straight to how you managed to come here.
    <br>How I managed to come to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations -
    <br>I went to my father's house one day and was watching the television because
    <br>my dad loves watching Emmanuel TV all the time.
    <br>So as I was watching it, the thought came to me - "You know I have gone around
    <br>all the churches in Nigeria. It only remains T.B. Joshua's church.
    <br>Try T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When you meet T.B. Joshua...
    <br>How I used to know the glory that was upon men of God was when I entered the church,
    <br>and looked at the pastor, if I could see your bald head,
    <br>I would know that my power was more than yours.
    <br>If you held me, told me to come out for deliverance and prayed for me,
    <br>I would shout, "Amen! Thank You, Father! Holy Ghost fire!"
    <br>But I would not feel anything.
    <br>You could lay your hands on me but I would not feel anything.
    <br>But since I had been around churches and initiated many people,
    <br>it only remained this Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>I then said that this was where I would come
    <br>so that I would defeat the pastor and be praised all over the world.
    <br>I didn't stay in one state.
    <br>Today, I might go to a church and when I was done with it, I would go to another one.
    <br>This was how I had been going around all the churches in Nigeria.
    <br>So, one good Sunday, I came into this church and I was sitting in the overflow section.
    <br>While I was there, they announced that those who would like to get the Anointing Water
    <br>should come outside and ushers would direct you on how to go about it.
    <br>I said I was interested because I was very bold to believe I would subdue any power,
    <br>whatever name they called it, so that I would be praised, magnified
    <br>and know that I was on top of the world.
    <br>I rushed out, got the Anointing Water, came into the church and sat down.
    <br>Not long afterwards, I began to experience a strange thing within me.
    <br>Constant urination started. I kept going out to urinate and coming back to sit down.
    <br>This kept continuing until we were taken inside for the second service.
    <br>But I was still not discouraged because I came for T.B. Joshua, to see if I could see his bald head,
    <br>so that I would subdue him as I had done in other churches.
    <br>So when I came into the main church, that urination kept continuing.
    <br>I wanted to go out but the ushers at the door said,
    <br>"No, don't go anywhere, they are praying.
    <br>After the prayer, you can go anywhere you want to go".
    <br>I said, "No problem".
    <br>I saw the wise men going around and people were falling.
    <br>I said, "Look, they have started" but I didn't concentrate on that
    <br>because I was watching if I would see T.B. Joshua.
    <br>It was because of him that I came.
    <br>The prayer was going on; they were delivering people.
    <br>People were falling, turning up and down everywhere.
    <br>If I entered a church, I saw that anybody who was afflicted would be upside down.
    <br>That was how you would know the initiated ones.
    <br>They were praying but I felt less concerned.
    <br>Later, I sat down.
    <br>Someone came and touched me, saying,
    <br>"Please stand up, brother, they have not prayed for this line.
    <br>Please, don't be offended" and I stood up with boldness.
    <br>Before I knew it, Wise Man Daniel came to my front,
    <br>laid his hand on my forehead and immediately,
    <br>I began to receive a thousand slaps.
    <br>When Wise Man Daniel came to me, before he laid his hand on me,
    <br>he laughed and asked, "Who is this lady near to you?"
    <br>He laughed and laid his hand on me; I received a thousand slaps instantly.
    <br>I hit his hand off. He laughed and left me.
    <br>He began to pray for others. After a little while, he came back again.
    <br>He laid the same hand on me and I received the same slaps.
    <br>I knew that something was really wrong with me.
    <br>I became more angry.
    <br>He came to me and said, "Follow me".
    <br>I began to follow him but I was not myself.
    <br>He brought his hand forward and said I should shake it.
    <br>I wanted to shake him but I didn't see his hand; there was a flame of fire.
    <br>There was just a flame of fire.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>He forced me but I refused to shake his hand.
    <br>He persisted.
    <br>When he started praying for me, I turned and became more aggressive.
    <br>When I turned, I saw the cameraman recording me.
    <br>I said, "This is the same way I watched people get delivered on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Is that why this cameraman is recording me,
    <br>I who wanted to be exalted, be the king and be on top of the whole world?
    <br>And for me now to be recorded? No!"
    <br>I was aggressive and began to spit my venom towards the cameraman
    <br>to blind his eyes. I wanted to blind him.
    <br>So immediately I wanted to, it seemed that anything I had in mind,
    <br>Wise Man Daniel would know it immediately.
    <br>He went to the cameraman, laid his hands on him and prayed for him.
    <br>For a wise man to abandon the member and now go to the cameraman to pray for him.
    <br>This is the thing he never said out.
    <br>He was meditating it - "I will do this" - inside him.
    <br>But before he could throw that saliva, the Wise Man went to the cameraman.
    <br>So immediately he prayed for the cameraman, that same flame that was
    <br>on Wise Man Daniel came upon the cameraman seriously.
    <br>So, I could not do anything again.
    <br>I saw the video camera was still there.
    <br>I stood up and said to myself that since he had prayed for the cameraman,
    <br>I should use my venom to cover the lense of the video camera.
    <br>I wanted to do it but Wise Man Daniel commanded me.
    <br>I became confused because anything that I had in mind,
    <br>immediately, he would be aware of it.
    <br>He began to call fire which was burning me. Everywhere was hot.
    <br>The whole place was not conducive. I tore my clothes. It was not okay for me.
    <br>The only thing I was trying to do was to blind all the people around me
    <br>but Wise Man Daniel kept pouring the fire of God on me and praying.
    <br>This kept continuing. I knew I was not myself; I was misbehaving
    <br>but I could not control myself.
    <br>Every time I tried to regain or reinforce my power by standing up,
    <br>the fire would come again and I would fall down.
    <br>This kept happening until suddenly, where I sat down, he began to say, "Fire!"
    <br>As he said that thing, the fire became so much where I sat down.
    <br>If I wanted to react, it seemed as if my body would touch a wall around me - a flame of fire.
    <br>That was how that wall was around me.
    <br>If I wanted to move, the wall would not allow me so I decided to sit down
    <br>and respect myself so that the fire would not burn me more than it already was,
    <br>for me not to touch that flame of fire.
    <br>Mr Enny's father comes forward to share his experience.
    <br>He explains how the idol his forefathers worshipped possessed his son,
    <br>the strange behaviour he started noticing in his son right from a young age
    <br>and how the evil spirit tormented the family.
    <br>My name is Anthony Eboka.
    <br>I'm the father to the boy.
    <br>What I want to say to the whole world is that I noticed the human race
    <br>is in trouble if this could happen to my son.
    <br>I am a disciplined father to the core.
    <br>When my son was young, honestly, I suffered so much in the hands of this boy.
    <br>At that time, I was into telecommunications but to eat was a problem.
    <br>I noticed in the attitude of my children that although they seemed very humble,
    <br>if you saw them in my house, they were just like lions.
    <br>If you were ten attempting to fight Enny, he would beat all of you.
    <br>In the last case I had with him, even the police were ashamed because
    <br>he came to disarm them.
    <br>Looking at the junior ones, especially the girl that is next to him - I really suffered.
    <br>There was a time when a man approached her, maybe to chase her away.
    <br>She beat the man and used a bottle to remove one of his teeth.
    <br>She was not up to this age then.
    <br>I took the man to a hospital and paid for him to get an artificial tooth.
    <br>The junior ones don't have friends who come to the house to play with them.
    <br>Then I discovered that our origin is from Benin.
    <br>I'm from Delta State (Nigeria) but our family's origin is from Benin.
    <br>The town I am from is called Ancholana in Delta State
    <br>while the village inside there is called Ishekpe.
    <br>They said this means, 'Lion Head' which they used in going to war.
    <br>My village is known for being very stubborn. People don't go near there.
    <br>If they fight there, the fights are always deadly.
    <br>About what he was saying, Idigwu was the idol worshipped by my forefathers.
    <br>My elder brother started worshipping it out of ignorance but we were all involved.
    <br>When the mother came to me, I was to marry her but before then,
    <br>she gave birth to my first two children.
    <br>When she was pregnant with this boy, I sent her to Nsukka, Enugu State
    <br>because I didn't have experience in this.
    <br>On getting there, my brother gave the mother water to drink,
    <br>she took it and this boy was born into the family.
    <br>Since this boy was born, honestly, I have never experienced peace in my life.
    <br>Like he said that his father suffered - that is the truth.
    <br>Even my relations abandoned me.
    <br>Because of sickness, sometimes I would carry him on my shoulders, going everywhere alone.
    <br>I said to myself, "What are all these things?"
    <br>Parents should be careful with their children.
    <br>Before coming to this place, he came to me about two months ago.
    <br>Then, he stayed with me for about one month.
    <br>Glory be to God for Emmanuel TV!
    <br>He didn't come with his own clothes but was wearing mine.
    <br>If he wore it, I would refuse to wear it again.
    <br>I didn't collect his money, even though sometimes I'd see him with millions.
    <br>Even if he bought bread and brought it, I wouldn't eat it. The spirit in me rejected it.
    <br>One day, there was one of my neighbours who came and saw what was happening.
    <br>He began suspecting something and asked why I didn't wear anything my son wore.
    <br>I said I wouldn't wear it until I washed it or prayed over it. At times, I would burn it.
    <br>It was only when he saw what happened on Emmanuel TV that he understood.
    <br>This is what I am saying to parents.
    <br>There are many parents who die out of ignorance.
    <br>Honestly, if not for the grace of God in my life...
    <br>Look at what happened, the battle fought here with a spiritual man,
    <br>talk less of me who is in a nursery school in the spirit.
    <br>I thank God today.
    <br>When he came, because he watched T.B. Joshua 24 hours a day in my house, he got convinced.
    <br>I was coming back from church on Sunday when he called me and told me
    <br>he was in T.B. Joshua's church. I said, "Glory be to God!"
    <br>We came back home, tuned into Emmanuel TV and his siblings saw him.
    <br>They said, "Look at him! Look at our brother!"
    <br>I said, "Glory be to God!"
    <br>When the battle was going on, I was praying for God to take control.
    <br>The next day, he called me to say he was no more there.
    <br>I asked him where he was. He said he was outside, wanting to deal with T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He called me again and I told him to go back to the church.
    <br>He said that he would prepare himself first.
    <br>I said, "Good".
    <br>At the end, glory be to God for this ministry.
    <br>I thank God that this boy was delivered.
    <br>Mr Enny's uncle comes forward.
    <br>He was the one who worshipped the god of iron
    <br>that possessed Mr Enny after his mysterious birth.
    <br>Let's hear from him.
    <br>My name is Martin Eboka.
    <br>I am from Delta State (Nigeria).
    <br>I am based at Nsukka. I am a builder.
    <br>I was the one serving the idol called Idigwu but I entered into it out of ignorance
    <br>because my people said nobody was serving it anymore and it was for protection.
    <br>Since I was a builder, I decided to carry on the tradition and took it up.
    <br>So, I had been serving the idol, but after a certain time, my junior brother brought
    <br>his wife to me as she was having a problem in delivering her baby.
    <br>After eleven months of pregnancy, her colour started to change.
    <br>I said that since I was serving this idol, I should go to the seers to ask them what was happening.
    <br>The man said that I had an idol called Idigwu
    <br>and that I should use water to wash the idol, which was just like a stone,
    <br>and then give the woman to drink.
    <br>He said if I did this, she will go into labour that day and give birth.
    <br>I said, okay. It was on Sunday.
    <br>I called the woman and she agreed to drink it
    <br>because the pregnancy had already reached eleven months.
    <br>I washed the idol in water and then gave the water to her.
    <br>That day I had a meeting so I went there in the afternoon and came back around 7pm.
    <br>My wife was not in the house. They said she had gone to the hospital.
    <br>Around 10pm, someone came and said my brother's wife had delivered a baby boy.
    <br>I thanked God. It was on the same day.
    <br>So, I continued worshipping this idol but as time went on, nothing was working for me.
    <br>My wife's shop stopped - she couldn't sell again. My job - no way.
    <br>My children - promise and fail. None of my daughters has married.
    <br>I myself turned into a drunkard.
    <br>I didn't know what I was doing again.
    <br>I had been planning to come to T.B. Joshua to know what was happening in my life.
    <br>So, I thank God when my brother sent me this message that our son was there
    <br>and we were asked to come.
    <br>I was so happy and I fought to borrow money to come
    <br>because even to feed was a tug of war.
    <br>So, what I am begging God now is that I also need my deliverance.
    <br>I have destroyed the house of Idigun and thrown it inside the water.
    <br>Since then, I have not seen any spirit, to tell you the facts,
    <br>but what I was seeing was that things were hard for me.
    <br>As I am here, please, Man of God, deliver me.
    <br>Mr Martin explained that although he threw the idols away physically,
    <br>he and his family were still being tormented by the evil spirit.
    <br>The idol made him a drunkard.
    <br>and all his children were experiencing disappointments.
    <br>This goes to show that there is not enough physical strength to stop satan.
    <br>There is not enough mental strength to stop satan.
    <br>Satan can only be stopped by the strength of the Lord.
    <br>Children of God all over the world, I thank God and I am very happy.
    <br>Today is my happiest day.
    <br>Ever since my deliverance, I am now the man that God made me to be.
    <br>I am very happy. Before I didn't dream but now I dream.
    <br>I sleep well, read the Scriptures and pray.
    <br>I don't feel that demonic heat again.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to beg Nigerians.
    <br>I don't see Idigwu, the queen of the coast or anything of that nature again.
    <br>I am begging the whole of Nigeria and Ghana, to the people I have offended
    <br>by commanding them to give me their money.
    <br>I am begging you, in the name of God, to forgive me.
    <br>What I saw here was not what I expected.
    <br>At a point, I even begged to leave the church.
    <br>I was not even bothered about seeing T.B. Joshua again because the fire was much.
    <br>It was even Wise Man Daniel who was dealing with me like this.
    <br>Later, after the deliverance I was saying within myself that
    <br>if it was T.B. Joshua who prayed for me, the fire might have burnt me inside the church.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to beg T.B. Joshua for going to two police stations
    <br>to make my report in order to arrest him.
    <br>Please, I am very sorry for that. Forgive me.
    <br>People of God, help me to rejoice!
    <br>As I had initiated millions of souls for the devil,
    <br>I will serve God and win billions of souls for God all over the world,
    <br>in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Awesome God mighty God
    <br>We give You praise awesome God
    <br>We give You praise mighty God
    <br>Finally, Mr Enny has been delivered from the evil spirit that possessed him for so long.
    <br>Unclean spirits cause us to lose control and commit all shameful acts.
    <br>However, glory be to God, Mr Enny has been set free from the hands of darkness.
    <br>A deliverance that extends to the whole family.
    <br>Now, the chains satan used to connect their entire family to himself
    <br>has been broken, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers around the world, let Mr Enny's experience be a lesson to all of us
    <br>that demons are real.
    <br>Therefore, Christianity is not to be practised as a hobby for there are dangers in it.
    <br>Let the confession of your lips have your heart's full agreement as a Christian.
    <br>What a danger is a religion of words with no corresponding action.
    <br>We give You praise awesome God
    <br>We give You praise mighty God
    <br>You are highly lifted up awesome God
    <br>You are highly lifted up mighty God
    <br>Man made gods
    <br>I will never worship man made gods
    <br>Worship Time
    <br>Man made gods
    <br>I will never worship man made gods
    <br>Worship Time
    <br>Higher higher
    <br>Lift Him up
    <br>Worship Time
    <br>Jehovah Jireh
    <br>You delivered me my Lord
    <br>When my heart was in trouble o
    <br>I will glorify Your name
    <br>Jehovah Jireh
    <br>You delivered me oh Lord
    <br>When my heart was in trouble o
    <br>I will glorify Your name
    <br>I will sing You songs of praise
    <br>You are worthy of my praise
    <br>Forgive me all my sins oh Lord
    <br>I will receive Your mercy
    <br>You promised to carry my burden Lord
    <br>You promised to be with me forever more
    <br>I am here for You
    <br>Take me to Your Kingdom
    <br>Worship Time
