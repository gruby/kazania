    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On Sunday 22nd May 2016, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a word of prophecy
    <br>concerning the state of politics, especially in Africa.
    <br>Let us hear from him.
    <br>Let me now come to the politics here.
    <br>African leaders should quickly arrest the political situation.
    <br>Politics will not be business as usual.
    <br>You know, everybody wants to be a politician.
    <br>You run to this because of money; you invest your money on it.
    <br>It's not going to work like that - unless you are called to the job.
    <br>When you are called, you cannot resist; you cannot say, "No".
    <br>If God calls you to run, you cannot stop running.
    <br>If it is your calling to run, you will find yourself running.
    <br>You are not going to run because of money
    <br>but because of love for it, you are called for it.
    <br>So, it's not business as usual.
    <br>Whatever you spend in elections, it will only earn you good name;
    <br>you cannot get any profit from it.
    <br>If you collect money and expect to return it back, you cannot get it returned.
    <br>So, therefore, it's not business again.
