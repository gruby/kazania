  <p>    
    <br>When you leave here, where are you going, madam?
    <br>Yola.
    <br>To whom?
    <br>I stay with my mum.
    <br>Because I’m seeing you living on your own.
    <br>What is wrong with you?
    <br>You are frustrated.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>And this frustration has led you to do many things which you don’t want to do.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>And you are tired now.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>There was a man you were with for some time and you left.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- What happened?
    <br>There was something you discovered.
    <br>This is your daughter.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I say that your daughter is a troubled daughter.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I have problems.
    <br>We came all the way from Yola.
    <br>We came from Yola.
    <br>You don’t know what is happening.
    <br>Yes, sir, I don’t know, even in my own life.
    <br>Let's go.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Doris.
    <br>I am from Yola.
    <br>Last week Sunday, the man of God walked up to me and prophesied.
    <br>He asked me where I was going from here.
    <br>He saw me living alone and that I was frustrated and tired.
    <br>That has caused me to do things that I did not want to do.
    <br>He said that I broke up with a man because I discovered something
    <br>and that I was a troubled daughter which was very true and correct.
    <br>When he asked me where I was going from here, I said Yola but in Yola things were so difficult for us.
    <br>Our rent has expired and we have no money to pay for the house rent.
    <br>People look at me as if I was OK and as if I have money but I had nothing.
    <br>This caused frustration.
    <br>I even tried to stab myself many times, to kill myself but my mum would come and hold me.
    <br>I was just tired of the life I was living.
    <br>I have no work, nothing.
    <br>Look at me; I ought to be married but no man is coming.
    <br>So, what the man of God said concerning you was correct while asking where were you going -
    <br>you actually have nowhere to go now.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK. Can we hear a word or two from your mother?
    <br>I believe she also has something to say.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>We are from Yola.
    <br>When we came here, the man of God prophesied to my daughter that she was a troubled daughter.
    <br>Then, I got up and said: "Yes, and even myself."
    <br>Later, the man of God said that we should come and see him.
    <br>So, our lives are miserable.
    <br>Even when he asked where we were going to…
    <br>We have nowhere to go.
    <br>We have no destination.
    <br>We have nowhere to go because right now, we have nothing.
    <br>She wants to kill herself; she wants to stab herself.
    <br>Anytime she takes a knife to kill herself, I would hold her.
    <br>I would talk to her saying that she should believe in God because
    <br>God is the God that makes impossible possible.
    <br>Before we came here, I was thinking how it would be possible for us to come because there was no way.
    <br>Somebody gave me some things to sell.
    <br>I then took her and said: "Come, let's run to our father, T.B. Joshua."
    <br>I think this is the last bus stop.
    <br>So, madam, we just want to hear from you.
    <br>You can see the old woman shedding tears because of the situation they have been in, for years.
    <br>You said the man of God had prophesied that your daughter was a troubled child.
    <br>Can you tell us more about these troubles that your child was facing, before the prophecy was given,
    <br>during the last service?
    <br>The trouble she is facing is that she has no job, no husband or helper.
    <br>Even to eat is difficult and she has no house.
    <br>So, she decided that she was going to kill herself.
    <br>Several times, I’ve collected the knife from her.
    <br>Even rat poison – she would say she would drink it and I’d collect it from her.
    <br>The troubles of your child - how they affected you, as a mother?
    <br>It has affected me. 
    <br>Even right now, I am having heart problems.
    <br>The mother and the lady - when you listen to them...
    <br>You cannot blame them for their misfortune.
    <br>When we work, God still has to examine it.
    <br>That is; after you have done everything, humanly, God would still have to go through it and mark it.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>After you have done it perfectly to you, you cannot say: "It's alright".
    <br>God still will go through it and mark it one by one.
    <br>That is what you call grace.
    <br>After you have moved or walked, you say, "Yes, I do it perfectly" - as a Christian, that language is not right.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>As Christians we live under the grace - the grace covers us.
    <br>After you have moved or walked, done everything you could humanly,
    <br>and you say this was a right thing you have done - leave it for God.
    <br>God will still have to what?
    <br>Mark it.
    <br>So, it is up to God to give you a mark, whether it is 90%, 50%, 40% or ... it is over to God.
    <br>This is grace.
    <br>If anyone now says that this family is to be blamed, or you ask them, "You have hands and legs -
    <br>why can't you go and work?"
    <br>You need to ask yourself by what authority you achieved what you achieved.
    <br>The women - they have nowhere to live.
    <br>Mere look at their appearance and attire - very expensive and good looking -
    <br>but that could not confuse the Spirit of God.
    <br>The attire and everything were of the past glory.
    <br>Past what?
    <br>Glory.
    <br>Past glory - those things they had in the past.
    <br>So, the mother and the daughter...
    <br>We have learned that the house rent is not less that N200,000.
    <br>They should give them N500,000 to start something.
    <br>PITIFUL: Elderly Mother Finds Daughter Drinking Rat Poison!!!
    <br>The man of God said the sum of N500,000 should be given to them to support the woman and her daughter.
    <br>PITIFUL: Elderly Mother Finds Daughter Drinking Rat Poison!!!
    <br>You can see the woman's tears of joy that leak on her cheek.
