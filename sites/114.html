  <p>    
    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua together, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen right now.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
    <br>Viewers at home, begin to confess your release.
    <br>I release you from your past of failure,
    <br>past of hardship,
    <br>past of sickness,
    <br>past of disease,
    <br>past of barrenness,
    <br>loneliness,
    <br>rejection,
    <br>sickness,
    <br>life of infirmity.
    <br>I release you!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release you!
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Confess your release!
    <br>I am released from a life of hardship,
    <br>I am released from a life of failure,
    <br>I am released from a life of limitation,
    <br>I am released from a life of infirmity,
    <br>I am released from a life of hatred.
    <br>I am released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, begin to cover yourself with the blood of Jesus.
    <br>I RELEASE YOU!
    <br>Prayer with T.B. Joshua
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God
    <br>as you send your testimony.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
