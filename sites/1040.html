    <br>I am Venerable Banmah Victor.
    <br>I'm a retired anglican priest.
    <br>I served the anglican communion for 15 years before I retired.
    <br>The woman next to me is the wife of my youth.
    <br>You must cherish the wife of your youth.
    <br>I'm getting to 82 years.
    <br>Venerable Banmah Victor & Wife
    <br>Retired Anglican Priest
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>The story I'm about to tell you is
    <br>what the motto of this church is - that distance is not a barrier.
    <br>I am of the anglican communion.
    <br>As you will know how people behave - I should not have anything to do with The SCOAN.
    <br>But the faith of God - if you demonstrate it, if you have it,
    <br>you can tell that mountain to move and it will move.
    <br>A mountain is not a physical thing. It's not. It does not exist anywhere.
    <br>Illness is a mountain and that is what I had.
    <br>I had pains in my ear.
    <br>And you know if you have pain in your ear, you will lose your balance.
    <br>So I started to fall in places where I thought I didn't need to.
    <br>Sometimes, I would fall in my room.
    <br>So I was afraid that I may not be able to attain the age of 81 that I am today.
    <br>But one night, my wife scrolled down to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>And I was there. I was sitting down lazily; I was looking at what was happening.
    <br>That whatever the prophet directed, I would do.
    <br>He said, "Affliction!"
    <br>Everybody would say, "Go!"
    <br>"Affliction!" - I also said the same thing, "Out!"
    <br>Venerable Banmah Victor & Wife
    <br>Retired Anglican Priest
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>At the end of that session, I went into my room.
    <br>I started to have a slight pain on my temple.
    <br>I struck it a number of times, and the pain ceased.
    <br>But following that, immediately, I had some sensation in my nose.
    <br>And also following that, my right nostril was blocked.
    <br>I didn't know what it was. I thought it was mucus.
    <br>So I sucked it into my mouth and spat it out. It was like a twig.
    <br>I called my wife and said, "Something has come out from my nose".
    <br>We used the torch light. I started to look...
    <br>The evidence of what I saw is what is in this bottle.
    <br>It's a six-inches long worm.
    <br>You can imagine if this is in your body, you cannot live long.
    <br>I went to many doctors.
    <br>I went to an ENT specialist and she gave me drugs.
    <br>I also went to a physician who gave me exactly the same drugs.
    <br>They did nothing.
    <br>For over two years, I was battling with this problem.
    <br>Until that faithful day when I put my hand on the television
    <br>and said what the prophet was directing and this worm came out of my body.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Our father, with due respect, ever since this worm came out of you, what are the things you can do now?
    <br>I don't stagger and I hear perfectly well.
    <br>At that time, I couldn't bite a bone but listen to how I rattle my teeth.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now, our dear father,  what the Lord has done in your life,
    <br>what word of advice do you have for all who are listening to you?
    <br>Sorry, I have a second testimony.
    <br>It follows the same pattern.
    <br>The prophet was praying and he said, "Those who eat with dead people in the night..."
    <br>I knew that I was eating with dead people in the night in my dreams.
    <br>So as he was praying, I was rubbing my stomach downwards.
    <br>Then immediately, I felt some movement in my stomach and the urge to go to the toilet.
    <br>So I rushed to the toilet and the only thing that came out was a round object as big as a ping-pong,
    <br>looking exactly like a walnut.
    <br>I didn´t take the picture of that because it was inside the water. Praise the Lord!
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>And ever since you passed out that stuff, do you still eat with dead people in your dreams?
    <br>No dreams anymore.
    <br>It happened on the 20th of last month.
    <br>Till today, I don't dream of any dead people or eat with them.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>I will refer to the psalmist who said,
    <br>"If you hear the voice of God, do not harden your heart".
    <br>Today, the voice of God through the prophet is here,
    <br>it is louder and clearer and it is heard in all the continents.
    <br>So brothers and sisters, why will you not listen to the prophet?
    <br>Now, I´m imagining that very shortly, The SCOAN is going to become a pilgrimage destination.
    <br>That is, people will come from all over the world - not because they are sick
    <br>but to come and taste of what is happening here, to come and taste all the prayers,
    <br>to come and taste all the sermons and to come and taste all the teaching.
    <br>Brothers and sisters, I call on you. If you are far off, it doesn't matter.
    <br>Distance is nothing. It´s not a barrier. I call on you.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>The prophet of the Most High God T.B. Joshua also loves you.
    <br>He loves you with passion!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Mrs. Christiana Banmah. I'm 66 years old.
    <br>I confirm what my husband, my beloved husband, has said to be true.
    <br>And now you can see how fit he is, even at the age of 82 - going to 82.
    <br>He can chew bones but before this time, he could not do anything. I thank God Almighty!
    <br>I give Him the glory for using the great Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to do mighty works in this land, in the whole world, in the lives of men and women.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>I want to seize this opportunity, to use this médium to remind and to advise
    <br>the doubting Thomases and the faithless pharisees, in quotes.
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>Don't harden your heart as in the day of provocation.
    <br>The purpose of God will be established in this country, in this SCOAN, in the name of Jesús!
    <br>God is still saying something so don't harden your heart.
    <br>That is the only advice I have for them.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>God is still speaking.
    <br>He still has plenty of things to tell us.
    <br>And you can hear God through the prophet - the prophet of the Most High God.
    <br>What he has done for me, mainly through the televisión, it is a miracle.
    <br>When I mentioned it to my church - you know our church, you know how they can be.
    <br>They don't want to hear about any church where they make progress.
    <br>But I said, "No, this is not something I can keep to myself.
    <br>I must tell the whole world that there is a man in Nigeria, in Lagos,
    <br>in The SCOAN, that can do a lot of things to help humanity.
    <br>He has touched my life and he will touch the life of my children as time goes on. Praise the Lord!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the Miracle-working God!
