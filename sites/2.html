    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Ama Amo. I am a Ghanaian but I stay in Australia.
    <br>I'm here with the problem of being addicted to eating moth balls
    <br>or camphor balls normally known as moth balls.
    <br>It started two and a half years ago. I had a friend who requested for
    <br>camphor balls and I told him I have some at home
    <br>that I was not using and I would get them for him.
    <br>When I got home in the haste to leave my house,
    <br>I poured some of the moth balls into my bag and I carried it with me.
    <br>So, wherever I went and I opened my bag, the smell would get to me.
    <br>Something told me that this thing smelled very good.
    <br>From that time it occured to me that it smelled very good
    <br>and I started smelling the moth balls.
    <br>So, I kept on smelling it but it wasn't enough, I had a craving for more.
    <br>So, I started crushing it into powder and sniffing the moth balls.
    <br>It's a very toxic substance.
    <br>When I sniffed it, I would usually get a blocked nose and my nose would not clear up
    <br>till after some hours and it was very uncomfortable.
    <br>Then, something told me, why don't you just eat it.
    <br>When you eat it, you will get a better sensation.
    <br>So that was when I started eating the moth balls
    <br>and I have been eating it for the past two and a half years.
    <br>I have tried on my own to stop so many times, it has not been possible.
    <br>Back in Australia, you can't find any moth balls to buy.
    <br>It is not something that you can buy.
    <br>I always had to buy them from Ghana and have it sent over to me in Australia.
    <br>Whenever I went to Ghana, I would buy it in bulk, and then send them to Australia.
    <br>There was a time I stopped eating it;
    <br>I threw all that I had away and I said to myself that I would not take it any longer
    <br>but after a week, the craving came so strong, that I had to call my friend
    <br>that was coming from Ghana to Australia and I told her, please get me moth balls
    <br>and she brought me some and I have been eating it ever since.
    <br>When I was sniffing it, my husband told me that I must stop this thing.
    <br>It's not a normal thing. It is very abnormal; stop it.
    <br>He still doesn't even know that I still eat it up to this time.
    <br>I have been eating it and it has affected me in so many ways. I have some with me here.
    <br>Even in the church, I felt the craving to eat the moth balls.
    <br>How do you eat it? Eat it. Let's see.
    <br>My God!
    <br>Addicted To Eating Moth Balls
    <br>The woman said that despite the fact that this substance is very poisonous, she cannot resist eating it.
    <br>She has been addicted to eating it for the past two and a half years.
    <br>Who has the Anointing Water here?
    <br>If you have the Anointing Water here and you are just coming for the first time...
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>This is not the power, it's water but God affected it.
    <br>So, by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the name of Jesus Christ - ok?
    <br>That is it.
    <br>So face her!
    <br>Face her. In the name of Jesus - let's hear from you.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Ok, stand up!
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>What happened to you? Tell us first.
    <br>I just felt a force pushing me.
    <br>A force pushing you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Bring the camphor and let us see.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Take it! Close your eyes and take one.
    <br>Close your eyes!
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>The taste has changed, it's not nice anymore.
    <br>It used to be very nice, it had a sweet smell.
    <br>Now?
    <br>Now, it tastes like chemicals.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Ama Amo is now delivered from an addiction to eating camphor balls,
    <br>commonly known as moth balls.
    <br>She takes a drink of water and swishes it around in her mouth
    <br>in order to remove the remaining bits of camphor balls from her mouth
    <br>and now desires the taste of proper food.
    <br>She rejoices, thankful for her new found freedom in Christ Jesus
    <br>for when the Son of God sets you free, you are free indeed.
    <br>As she happily tucks into her meal, we are reminded that God is good
    <br>and because God is good we can bring our request to Him, share our concerns with Him
    <br>and cast our cares upon Him.
    <br>Jesus Christ is ready to meet you at the point of your need as He did for Ama Amo.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ama Amo.
    <br>I am here to testify of the very good thing the Lord did in my life.
    <br>Last week, I came here with the problem of an addiction
    <br>to eating camphor balls, normally known as moth balls.
    <br>I had been suffering with this for the past two and a half years.
    <br>I had tried so many times to stop on my own but it yielded no results.
    <br>So, I decided to come to The SCOAN for deliverance.
    <br>During the service, I narrated my whole issue and the man of God asked,
    <br>if there was someone who had the Anointing Water in the congregation.
    <br>So, a gentleman stood up and came.
    <br>The man of God asked him to administer the Anointing Water on me.
    <br>When he started spraying the Anointing Water, I felt a force come upon me
    <br>and I couldn't help myself; I found myself on the floor.
    <br>Since then, I have been delivered of eating camphor.
    <br>I thank the Lord!
    <br>All the symptoms I used to experience, all the stomach aches, the diarrhoea left me.
    <br>I am free today. I am totally delivered of eating camphor balls.
