  <p>    
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>I’m afflicted by a stiff neck due to cervical spondylosis
    <br>and a knee problem due to osteoarthritis with torn cartilages.
    <br>My name is Professor Ddembe Williams.
    <br>I’m a professor of complex systems and mathematics.
    <br>I cannot teach anymore because I cannot stand.
    <br>I can’t do research because I cannot sit for long.
    <br>Please, help me.
    <br>I have been everywhere, in every hospital; I had the best physicians and consultants but to no avail.
    <br>I knew that my last bus stop would be this place.
    <br>After your healing and deliverance, you should be ready to render your services
    <br>for some months, in Africa here.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Your wife...
    <br>because you have challenges.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It's God that saved you.
    <br>So, after the healing, we’ll talk about that.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>There's a boy.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Where’s this boy?
    <br>Back in United Kingdom.
    <br>But he’s not with you.
    <br>No, he’s not with me.
    <br>That is why I’m asking you.
    <br>Because these are the issues we are going to work on.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>But this is not the time to talk about that now.
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>OK, can you remove all this?
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Turn your neck.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I'm healed!
    <br>I can run!
    <br>Prof Ddembe Williams 
    <br>Healed In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Prof Ddembe Williams 
    <br>Healed In Jesus’ Name
    <br>I feel free. I feel light, very light!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>He is a picture of good health, to the glory of God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Professor Ddembe Williams.
    <br>I am a professor of complex systems & data analytics.
    <br>I'm from the United Kingdom.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN is affliction in my neck.
    <br>I had stiff neck and that caused severe pain; I could not turn or bend.
    <br>It also caused paralysis in my heart.
    <br>I also had osteoarthritis in my knees; later it emerged that I had torn cartilages in my knees.
    <br>Basically, walking, standing and sitting was difficult; I lived in pain.
    <br>It was some time back when my maid and my driver said,
    <br>"You know, we've seen people being healed at Emmanuel TV".
    <br>I said, "Which one is that?"
    <br>That was 6 months ago.
    <br>I started watching, got inspiration, built up my faith and kept on praying.
    <br>Even if I slept in the lounge, I would switch on my Emmanuel TV,
    <br>to have it on in the background while I was sleeping.
    <br>I could not sit for long to write my papers.
    <br>By the time I finished my PhD I had already about 20 papers, but I could not write this time,
    <br>I could not go to class to teach my PhD or Masters class, because I couldn't stand for long.
    <br>An hour was utmost and I would still be in severe pain.
    <br>That affected me, my career because I wasn't contributing to my job,
    <br>and my institution started getting worried, looking for an alternative to replace me,
    <br>put me on leave and so forth.
    <br>That affected certainly my performance, but also my family.
    <br>My wife had all the time to miss her daily routine, her job to take me to the hospital.
    <br>For example: Every winter I had to go to the hospital and she had to push me in a wheelchair.
    <br>When I was travelling, I was seated in the wheelchair.
    <br>It became very cumbersome for me to do any job, or any useful contribution to society and my own family.
    <br>You said you went to various hospitals.
    <br>Medically, what did the doctors try to do to help you with this condition?
    <br>Medically, I went to many hospitals as you said, so many consultants...
    <br>As you know in the UK to get a consultant takes quite a long time,
    <br>but when I saw them, they could not really specify medications for me to be healed.
    <br>They gave me painkillers.
    <br>In a day I would take about 8 different tablets.
    <br>I was a kind of a walking pharmacy and it became really problematic,
    <br>because my local GP (general practitioner) said, "It might be that you will never get a cure for that,
    <br>you will live with these medications all your life".
    <br>So, it became very difficult.
    <br>It is the Holy Spirit who led me to The SCOAN.
    <br>I could not directly get my visa in the UK,
    <br>so I had to go to Nairobi where I managed to get a visa and then I came here.
    <br>When I came here, I was welcomed and put in the prayer line.
    <br>When the man of God came near me, while he was preaching,
    <br>it seemed as if he was preaching to me all the time.
    <br>I kind of kept on getting uplifting...
    <br>By the time he reached me, I was already done, because I could only hear his voice,
    <br>the congregation kind of disappeared.
    <br>I could only hear his voice and I was responding to his voice all the time.
    <br>When the man of God approached me and touched my left arm to the shoulder,
    <br>there was a hammer all the time.
    <br>I really felt a big punch of a hammer hitting me wherever he touched me.
    <br>It wasn't easy.
    <br>I could see his hand moving lightly like this, but it was translated to the body as a big hammer.
    <br>That kept on building up, until he said, "Stand up", and I just found myself standing up.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And since that day, sir, what are the changes in your life, health, everything about you?
    <br>Phenomenal - that's what.
    <br>Right from that day, I started walking and I haven't stopped.
    <br>I think people whom I've been with; going to the prayer mountain -
    <br>they have seen - I've been all the time trying, and now I can use my legs properly,
    <br>I can twist my neck - no problem at all; the arm is doing very well.
    <br>For the first time in 5 years, I went to the prayer mountain, knelt and prayed to my God.
    <br>So, I would like to really recommend to the viewers all over the world and in the congregation
    <br>that it is only Jesus and faith that can work.
    <br>Also to my academics: I know there are diverging views between scientific endeavour and the biblical Word.
    <br>I think those views are converging now.
    <br>I'm an example where convergence of scientific and God's views are coming together.
    <br>When you have a miracle like this, we scientists say, "This is unexplained",
    <br>but I want to tell the whole world that that unexplained is Jesus plus faith.
    <br>And that's what really healed me.
    <br>The Holy Spirit helped me to build my faith and with the prayers Jesus really located me,
    <br>and gave me this healing through the grace of the man of God
    <br>whom Jesus used as His channel to heal people like myself.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Sir, can you just now demonstrate what you can now do that you couldn't do before, to the glory of God.
    <br>Well, I can walk smartly in front of my students and give a lecture.
    <br>I can do many things; maybe I'm going to start playing football.
    <br>And of course, I can shake my neck and twist my hands, which I was not able to do earlier.
    <br>It is amazing.
    <br>I can testify that since last week Saturday, I have not taken a single tablet;
    <br>whethers painkiller, whether vitamins - nothing at all.
    <br>Jesus is my medication.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Just a final question, sir:
    <br>During your encounter with the man of God, he actually gave you a Word of prophecy concerning your son.
    <br>Can you just confirm how that Word of prophecy is also true for your life?
    <br>Actually, the man of God gave me two prophecies; one was about my son.
    <br>Yes, we have a child...
    <br>All my kids, I would say are brilliant as academics, they pursue their academic endeavours excellently,
    <br>but we have one who really can't progress.
    <br>We have tried to support him, taking him to psychologists, sociologists, psychiatrists,
    <br>but of no avail.
    <br>With the prophecy, I'm sure that has now come to an end;
    <br>he will be able to progress forward like any other child.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>And he also prophesied about my wife.
    <br>We had challenges and I'm glad that...
    <br>Today, when I woke up in the morning, my wife was the first one to wish me the best for today -
    <br>so, that's already a breakthrough.
