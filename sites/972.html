  <p>    
    <br>Viewers, God’s time is the best.
    <br>Any moment from now, we shall be ushered into the New Year.
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>What is New Year?
    <br>What do we understand by year – ‘New Year’?
    <br>It is a gift from God – a part of the divine nature of God.
    <br>In the New Year, you are called to God’s kind of lifestyle – I mean, His divine essence
    <br>in terms of faithfulness, steadfastness and love.
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>It is all about God – the New Year.
    <br>If it is all about God, nothing of God can be possible unless our heart is pure.
    <br>In the Book of Matthew 5:8, Christ tells us, “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God”.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>It is all about heart.
    <br>What is the position of your heart?
    <br>Are you holding grudges?
    <br>When you hold grudges against a brother, you have already grieved the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Nothing good can come.
    <br>Viewers, let us pray.
    <br>Whatever barrier between you and the Spirit of God – be removed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>As you enter the New Year, whatever barrier between you and the Spirit of God -
    <br>be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever wall between you and the Spirit of God – be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I want to believe that your relationship with God has been re-established.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>In the New Year 2018, your relationship with God has been re-established.
    <br>Whatever wall, whatever barrier between you and the Spirit of the Father -
    <br>be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let there be a relationship between you and God, in Jesus Christ’s name!
    <br>Viewers, Happy New Year!
    <br>I want to let you know right now,
    <br>every unfavourable situation you have been in, in the year 2017 has been ended with the year!
    <br>Every unfavourable situation in your business, career, marriage and family -
    <br>cease, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Unfavourable situation in your health,
    <br>whatever challenges you are facing in your blood, fluids, tendons,
    <br>in your way, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>At the command of Jesus, Peter walked on the sea.
    <br>At the command of Jesus, Blind Bartimaeus received his sight.
    <br>I command every unfavourable situation you have been in, in the year 2017 -
    <br>cease and end with 2017!
    <br>You are ushered into the New Year, 2018.
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>Happy New Year, my brothers!
    <br>Happy New Year, once again!
    <br>This is the voice of God to you.
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>This is the right time and the Word you are receiving is from the throne of God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Happy New Year, once again!
    <br>Yes, I know you are expecting many things from me - the message and the prophecy for the New Year.
    <br>Yes, God's time is the best.
    <br>I want to assure you that this message will be delivered at God's appropriate time.
    <br>HAPPY NEW BEGINNING 
    <br>On Behalf Of T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Family
