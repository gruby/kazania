    <br>PROPHETIC MESSAGE FOR 2017 | Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Good morning! 
    <br>(Good morning.)
    <br>You may be seated - thank you.
    <br>The message is 'Your Faith Will Not Fail'.
    <br>Let me take you to the book of Luke 22 from verse 1 to the end but we will go straight to the proof text.
    <br>Luke 22:32. Are you there?
    <br>"But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail."
    <br>And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."
    <br>Look at the word 'turn back'.
    <br>This is the way you are going.
    <br>I am going this way and you are saying, "T.B. Joshua, when you have turned back,
    <br>remember your brother..."
    <br>'When you have turned back, remember your brother and also, help them to turn back.'
    <br>Let's read verse 33:
    <br>"But he replied, 'Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death'.”
    <br>Aah, that is too confident.
    <br>The Lord is telling him that, "I'm afraid of you."
    <br>"No, don't be afraid of me. I am for You."- "I doubt you will be able to stand for Me."
    <br>No, don't doubt I can die for you.
    <br>"Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today,
    <br>you will deny three times that you know me."
    <br>Jesus knew that he was going to betray Him.
    <br>Jesus said to him again, 'After you have repented, you are to strenghten your brothers'.
    <br>It means, Jesus knew that Peter would betray Him and also knew that he would repent.
    <br>You are here today - Jesus knows you will repent.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Because He knows you.
    <br>Whatever happens, you are a stakeholder of the Kingdom of God.
    <br>You have a seat.
    <br>If your seat is empty, He knows that nobody can take over that seat; you will still come back.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Jesus knows I will repent".
    <br>(Jesus knows I will repent.)
    <br>If that is the case, as a born-again, your faith may fail but not utterly, not fall off.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "My faith may fail, not utterly." I mean, not fall off.
    <br>Again.
    <br>(My faith may fail, not utterly.)
    <br>Yes. Your faith may fail as a born-again but not utterly - that is, not fall off.
    <br>Because that faith is your root, your seed.
    <br>It remains in you - that is, you will still come back.
    <br>If you are a true born-again, your faith may fail but not utterly.
    <br>That means, you will still come back.
    <br>If you have wronged now, if you have missed the mark, you will still come back.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>That is the meaning of "born-again".
    <br>Once you are born-again, no one and nothing can separate you from God.
    <br>It is just to be born-again, genuinely.
    <br>But if you are not genuinely born-again - forget.
    <br>But, if you are genuinely born-again, nothing and nothing can separate you.
    <br>Your faith may fail, not utterly, not fall off.
    <br>"Once you are born-again you can not make a mistake" - that is the teaching.
    <br>And when you make mistake, aah, you do not want people to know.
    <br>Do you know what mistake can lead to?
    <br>Mistake cause serious, difficult circumstances.
    <br>Mistake cause difficult what?
    <br>And through difficult circumstances, you will be offended.
    <br>Through situations, you will be offended.
    <br>If you have pain now, or a headache, fever or cancer
    <br>and that pain is all over you, little things can offend you, overwhelm you.
    <br>Even when people greet you - do not greet me!
    <br>As if they the ones that had put a cancer in your body.
    <br>Through pain, through difficult circumstances, it may be disappointment...
    <br>You went to the company, and you expect to receive some goods.
    <br>Getting there, they say there is nothing like that.
    <br>Or getting to your company, they give you a sack letter.
    <br>You realize that in your company the young one has been promoted to supervise you.
    <br>As a human being, how would you feel?
    <br>Offence.
    <br>Whatever you begin to do at that moment will not come from your heart.
    <br>Everything around you will irritate and overwhelm you.
    <br>You will not want to give your best.
    <br>Even if you see money, you want to dupe, embezzle, to change the figures.
    <br>Through difficult circumstances, you will be offended.
    <br>You wake up in the morning and you find that you have had a nightmare.
    <br>Suddenly you look at your bed, you see that you wet the bed, a lot of things happened to you in the dream.
    <br>By the time you wake up you feel irritated.
    <br>If our faith is being kept up in an hour of temptation, though we may fall -
    <br>that is, our faith may fall – yet we shall not be utterly cast down.
    <br>In the case of His disciples, Jesus said, 'I pray your faith will not fail'.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Your faith may fail but not totally, not finally.
    <br>As it was with Job, with God's permission, you can be tempted.
    <br>You know: satan went to God to beg, "Allow me to do this to this man."
    <br>Satan's desire for you, as a Christian, is to have you, to attack you.
    <br>Don't forget he begged for permission from God to attack Job.
    <br>With God's permission, you can be attacked.
    <br>With God's permission, you can be tempted.
    <br>So, you Christian, if you now say; "why all this happening to me, why this, why this attack? I am a Christian."
    <br>No - with God's permission, you can be tempted.
    <br>If God allows it, if God has knowledge of it, if God is aware,
    <br>as was the case of Job, don't doubt your God.
    <br>Do not begin to doubt; "Why me? Am I not serving the living God? Why God should allow this to happen ?" …
    <br>Don’t doubt your God.
    <br>Don't let it affect your faith.
    <br>You can be attacked but you cannot be destroyed if God allows it.
    <br>What is happening to you as a born-again?
    <br>You born-again, what is happening to you?
    <br>As it was with Job, with God's permission, satan can tempt you.
    <br>As it was with Job, with God's permission, satan can attack you but cannot destroy you.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you are a true born-again, a true follower of Christ,
    <br>satan can only attack you if God permits it."
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>That means he can only attack you if God permits it.
    <br>Such attack will result in your desire for God – will strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>It will strengthen your determination for God – will improve your relationship.
    <br>Such an attack will make you strong.
    <br>Such attack will not impair you but improve you, if God permits it.
    <br>It is when you know this, you become a beneficiary.
    <br>You see that is it an attack.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am a child of God.
    <br>Yes - God is aware.
    <br>God permitted it and He is going to improve me, strengthen my desire, my determination.
    <br>I am not here today, to tell you about Moses or Jeremiah but I am telling you about what is happening to you.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>This is exactly what happens to you.
    <br>You would have been growing in your Christian life better than this
    <br>but each time this attack came, you forgot you were a Christian.
    <br>And if you know you are a Christian, a follower of God, you should know that God has knowledge of it.
    <br>And if God has knowledge of it, it means this attack will not impair you but improve you.
    <br>If God is aware, this means this temptation will make you stronger.
    <br>If God allows it, this means your desire and determination for God will increase.
    <br>This is just it.
    <br>It's only we cannot continue to pray for an attack or temptation.
    <br>It comes naturally, if God allows it.
    <br>It's a blessing.
    <br>If you are not a Christian, opposite is the case.
    <br>We know if you are not a Christian, satan cannot attack his children.
    <br>Can satan attack his children?
    <br>If satan cannot attack his children…
    <br>You are not his children, that is why you are attacked.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Your faith will  not fail".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>This coming year, your faith will not fail.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>Our situation, I mean our difficult circumstances – satan uses them to draw us into sin.
    <br>Satan uses our situation, our difficult circumstances, to draw us into what? Into sin.
    <br>The moment this attack comes, your thoughts change, you begin to see God in a bad light.
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>Oh my God, you begin to see God in a bad light.
    <br>Your Saviour will now turn into …
    <br>To pray is difficult because your heart is not in its best state.
    <br>It is when your heart or your spirit is in its best state that you can pray.
    <br>But you are worried.
    <br>No one can pray to God while worried.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "No one can pray to God while worried"
    <br>You will make an attempt but you are not praying to God, you are praying to yourself.
    <br>You are worried.
    <br>You now say: Jesus, give me a biscuit...No no no no
    <br>Your heart must be at its best because our heart is the prayer room.
    <br>Can you see why you keep deceiving yourself?
    <br>"Our heart is the prayer room" - tell your neighbour.
    <br>Say, "My heart is the prayer room".
    <br>So, if your heart is the prayer room, your heart must be at its best.
    <br>If your heart is the prayer room, where you keep as the prayer room is an altar…
    <br>Look at the altar.
    <br>If you came this morning and you saw shit, urine, flies everywhere, dust bins,
    <br>would you be able to sit down?
    <br>… so, in the same way…
    <br>If your heart is not at its best, whom are you praying to?
    <br>If you are troubled, you cannot pray and if you pray, you are praying of yourself.
    <br>That is why the enemy will often use this as a bait to get you – your situation.
    <br>Satan uses our situation, our difficult circumstances -
    <br>disappointment, failure, nightmares and everything around you not going well -
    <br>satan uses all these to draw us into sin.
    <br>He knows it is the only thing that can change your heart.
    <br>Your heart when it is at its best – you think about Christ, you meditate, you sing;
    <br>but when the trouble comes you change your confession.
    <br>You begin to see Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>That is why satan was waiting for a time like that to attack Jesus.
    <br>After realising Jesus had fasted for forty days and forty nights, satan realized that that man needs food.
    <br>And you know that when you fasted for forty days and forty nights then you need food badly.
    <br>Oh yes, this is the time to attack this man, situation
    <br>This is the time to attack this man, difficult circumstances – oh yes, He has difficulties now.
    <br>He needs food. 
    <br>He now took Him.
    <br>He began to seduce Him with food and every beautiful thing in the world.
    <br>But thank God – He was not desperate.
    <br>But today you are desperate.
    <br>Your desperation leads you to take anything.
    <br>No matter from where it comes, as long as you have a relief.
    <br>Jesus was not desperate.
    <br>He said, 'Although I am hungry, but I am not desperate'.
    <br>Although I am hungry, I've been fasting for forty days and forty nights, I am looking for something to eat
    <br>but I am not desperate.
    <br>To be desperate is to be so anxious…
    <br>You do not mind from where the food comes from, you just want to eat.
    <br>It was a food, and you tested, and it was good.
    <br>As Jesus gives food, satan too, has his own food.
    <br>His food lasts for now but God's food lasts for eternity.
    <br>This is why you can't receive blessing - as you receive it, it disappears.
    <br>You become a billionaire today, next year you become a poor man.
    <br>The peace I give, the money I give, and the food I am giving you ...
    <br>Not as the world gives you, not as satan gives them.
    <br>Satan will give you all this, looking like things I give you, but the difference is
    <br>at the time you need it most it disappears.
    <br>You see many in our times.
    <br>Some of the blessings you need now - at the time you need those blessing most - you cannot find them.
    <br>In summary: as it was with Job, with God's permission, you can be tempted.
    <br>As it was with Job, with God's permission, you can be attacked by satan.
    <br>If you look around and see; yes – I am follower of God, nothing is wrong.
    <br>An attack comes - you should know that God is aware.
    <br>God has knowledge of it
    <br>God allows it.
    <br>Let them come - promotion is about to come.
    <br>If God aware of what you are going through, what is happening to you,
    <br>yes, the question is – what does He want to prove?
    <br>Ask yourself, "What does He want to prove?"
    <br>Speak to yourself and speak out.
    <br>When you pray: Lord Jesus, I have a headache – heal me, and you are not healed.
    <br>You say you do not have faith.
    <br>You shouldn’t base your faith on the healing of your sickness.
    <br>You may not be healed, yet you have faith.
    <br>These are the challenges we are facing now.
    <br>We always base our faith on improvement of our prayer.
    <br>We base our faith on what?
    <br>Improvement of what?
    <br>A prayer.
    <br>If you pray and pray and your prayer is answered – you agree that you have faith.
    <br>If you pray and pray and your prayer is not answered – you do not have faith.
    <br>It honours God when we believe in Him when every sense contradicts Him.
    <br>When everything is not good and you still believe in Him, it honours Him more
    <br>than when everything is good and you believe in Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>It honours God most when you believe in Him when everything looks bad
    <br>than believing in Him when things look good.
    <br>You are in church today because everything seems to look bad,
    <br>but the moment things turn around, and you begin to count in thousands, trillion, houses, and other;
    <br>you will check your expensive watch,
    <br>you look at the time and say: no no Joshua, I can't sit here - it is too warm, too hot here.
    <br>But here it is not hot now. 
    <br>You are ready to sit down.
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>Now, you are here today and I believe next time you will come as an ex-loser.
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>Ex-loser.
    <br>You need to believe God.
    <br>The same way, if not more - the way you believe in Him now.
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>And also, always realize that your difficult situations and circumstances are the things satan uses
    <br>to drive you into sin.
    <br>You know, sin begins in our heart.
    <br>The war you are seeing today started from the heart.
    <br>The discussion: "we are going to do that…" before planning.
    <br>Therefore, the wrong or whatever you might have done started from your heart.
    <br>When satan uses our situation, our difficult circumstances to drag us into sin.
    <br>it means at that moment you are attacked -
    <br>whether it is a nightmare - when you wake up...
    <br>It is always difficult for you to pray.
    <br>When you wake up and you find that this is bad, this is a nightmare...
    <br>Even when you pray, you pray with a disturbed heart.
    <br>When you pray with a disturbed heart, you are not praying to God but to yourself.
    <br>That is an attack.
    <br>He uses those attacks to drag us into sin, to separate us from God,
    <br>to overthrow us from our position as a child of God.
    <br>Any time there is an attack,
    <br>if anyone tells you that because you are a Christian, you will not be attacked,
    <br>what of if God permits it, allows it, has knowledge of it or is aware?
    <br>So also, faith is your root to God.
    <br>There is nothing you can do with a root, unless you do not have that root at all.
    <br>It is your seed; it remains in you.
    <br>No matter how it fails, but not finally or totally.
    <br>May God bless His word.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>How does this message apply to you?
    <br>Can somebody stand up to tell me?
    <br>I am a Christian for now.
    <br>Thank you. 
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>He says he is a Christian.
    <br>Not only a Christian, but a born-again Christian.
    <br>- If I'm right...?
    <br>- You are right.
    <br>You can answer the question.
    <br>This message is an inspiration.
    <br>But as a Christian, before now - how did you handle the issue of faith?
    <br>You say you are a born-again.
    <br>What was your understanding of issue of faith?
    <br>Tell us how it was before now.
    <br>Before now - when I get something and get hurt, I get discouraged.
    <br>So with this message - it gives an inspiration that any temptation in life is a test, to prove my trust in God.
    <br>So, it permits to believe more in God.
    <br>There is a question you need to ask yourself:
    <br>when there is an attack or whatever you are facing, you need to ask yourself,
    <br>"Are you still a born again"?
    <br>If you can answer that question yourself: "I am a born-again" - good.
    <br>There is another question: "What does God want to prove?"
    <br>God wants to prove Himself as faithful, when I am facing temptation.
    <br>If I were to encourage myself with this message today,
    <br>which is an inspiration:  when I face temptation, I know that God wants to improve my life
    <br>through that trial to become a testimony in my life.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Never forget that it honours Him more to believe God when we are facing challenges.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>It honours God more to believe in Him when we are facing difficult circumstances.
    <br>You want to improve your relationship with God.
    <br>That is the time to improve it.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>Every true Christian would like to improve their relationship with God.
    <br>No matter the level of your relationship with God, you want improvement.
    <br>You want to sleep and see visions, understand His voice, hear His voice in your heart,
    <br>God to talk to you and you to God, feel Him, reach that level, see visions,
    <br>you want to know God's opinion about yourself and about others.
    <br>Yet, although you are a true Christian you cannot tell people the opinion of God about others.
    <br>You do not even know the God's opinion about yourself.
    <br>What kind of Christian are you?
    <br>Thank you brother.
    <br>We are going to ask a different question entirely.
    <br>First of all tell us your position before God.
    <br>What do you understand about an attack now, if you are a Christian, Sir?
    <br>As a journalist I have a different opinion about what attack is all about.
    <br>I believe that an attack differs from one country to another.
    <br>The way you get attacked in the western world is different from the way you got attacked in Africa.
    <br>So I see attacks in Africa as more spiritual.
    <br>But the other world is just by the grace of God.
    <br>But I have a contrary opinion to what man of God has said before I got here.
    <br>As a journalist I was looking for news to write
    <br>But when you said something about Peter Simon - if Peter Simon who failed, who am I?
    <br>I am a mere mortal.
    <br>I can fail at any time.
    <br>OK, what my brother asked - I want somebody to answer this question.
    <br>What type of attacks or temptations are we talking about?
    <br>Any foolish thing that the devil can use against us.
    <br>Be it sickness, or children turning against you.
    <br>I want to thank you - thank you.
    <br>What do you understand about this so-called attack?
    <br>To me as a Christian and a born-again,
    <br>I believe that an attack is anything that would want me to react, or to diminish my faith in Christ.
    <br>And the way we react, or we want to defend ourselves during the attack really matters.
    <br>So, as a child of God when any attack comes we have to think, and we know that any attack -
    <br>it is a way God uses to have us much more faith in Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Saturday Service
    <br>What I learned through this message are two characteristics, of a true "born-again".
    <br>Number one is that we know a true "born-again" - when he misses the mark,
    <br>because naturally he comes back to repentance.
    <br>And second characteristics is that a true "born-again" can be attacked only when God permits it.
    <br>This is to improve his faith and make him come closer in his relationship with God.
    <br>And this will help him.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You listen what he said: there are two things that he said here.
    <br>When a truly born-again Christian is attacked, he will surely come back to repentance.
    <br>That is a true born-again. 
    <br>It comes naturally.
    <br>That you are a born-again does not mean you cannot be attacked
    <br>but the difference between you and those who are not born again is that when you are attacked,
    <br>you will come to repentance.
    <br>That is born-again.
    <br>Those who are not born-again when they attack them, they attack back
    <br>and continue to live that life of attack.
    <br>The attack they receive will make them to go deeper in the dark.
    <br>From one witch doctor to another…
    <br>They begin to point an "accuse finger", looking for his attacker.
    <br>A time of attack is a time of promotion, to improve your relationship with God.
    <br>Take note – when you are born-again, nothing can separate you from the love of God.
    <br>What is the love of God?
    <br>The love of God is the way of God.
    <br>The love of God is eternal life.
    <br>It is all about being a born-again.
    <br>You just need to check yourself if you are really a born-again.
    <br>How do we know we are born again?
    <br>Sit down Sir.
    <br>Can somebody tell me how do you know you are a born-again?
    <br>How do you know you are born-again?
    <br>Uzbekistan - speaker.
    <br>She says she is from Uzbekistan, and when she was coming here she was attacked
    <br>and her bank card was blocked, but she went into prayer and said,
    <br>"Lord this is your will, and if you want me to be there I will be there".
    <br>So, she received it, she humbled herself and the Lord opened a way for her to come here.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>It is not only while coming here.
    <br>Even if you apply for a job and that job would benefit you,
    <br>and your life depends on that job, and it is a destine job.
    <br>Immediately you think about applying the attack starts.
