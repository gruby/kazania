    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There is a lady there - you are bleeding.
    <br>As I am talking now, you are bleeding.
    <br>So, please come out.
    <br>You are bleeding as I am talking.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>The woman I said was bleeding - there is piles.
    <br>You have piles.
    <br>I am talking to this woman.
    <br>You have piles and the piles sometimes come out.
    <br>You have to use your hand to push it.
    <br>When I said a woman is bleeding and two women came out,
    <br>I need to identify the person I am talking about.
    <br>It is not guesswork.
    <br>It is Holy Spirit's suggestion.
    <br>When He showed me light in complexion and piles...
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Mrs Chinwe Eheli.
    <br>I am a Nigerian residing in South Africa.
    <br>Last week Sunday I came straight from the airport to The SCOAN.
    <br>Arriving to the church, I was located by the man of God.
    <br>The first prophecy that came was mine.
    <br>I and some other people came out.
    <br>The man of God looked at me and said, "You are the one I am referring to.
    <br>It is not guesswork."
    <br>He said, "It is not guesswork" twice.
    <br>I am here standing to tell you that when the Holy Spirit located me, it was not guesswork indeed.
    <br>I have been having this problem for about two and a half years now.
    <br>I had to deal with this bleeding.
    <br>You expect yourself to finish your menstrual cycle in 4 days.
    <br>When it gets to 4 weeks, 6 weeks, there is something else.
    <br>As a result of that I started having iron deficiency.
    <br>This iron deficiency was so strong that I had to use 'iron tablets' all the time.
    <br>I would drink 'iron tablets', I would use medications for sportsmen
    <br>just to elevate myself, to get a little bit of energy.
    <br>It went on and on like that.
    <br>It was not only the bleeding - the bleeding led to iron deficiency.
    <br>That iron deficiency graduated to eating soil.
    <br>I would go to the market, buy any soil there.
    <br>Sometimes, if I ran out of soil, I could go out, clean the top of any soil and eat it.
    <br>Now, the soil caused me to have constipation - I was not able to use the toilet as I should.
    <br>The piles came as a result of constipation.
    <br>This bleeding I am talking about - it is not just bleeding.
    <br>I would be bleeding from the normal menstrual cycle and from the anus,
    <br>so, it was double bleeding.
    <br>Because already a part of the anus was coming out, I had a wound there
    <br>that bled all the time, whenever I went to the toilet.
    <br>It was a hassle indeed.
    <br>It affected me so much, because as a woman I was always very tired.
    <br>I could not perform my duties as a wife.
    <br>I couldn't cook food because when I was tired I could not do anything.
    <br>My husband would be assisting me here and there.
    <br>Also, I could not perform my duties as a woman in the bedroom.
    <br>You understand what I mean.
    <br>It was to the extent that my husband ended up asking me,
    <br>"My wife, when I call you in the morning, you are not there.
    <br>I call you in the afternoon, you say at night. When it is night, you are not there."
    <br>And I am like, "You know what? Let's give God time."
    <br>About two weeks before coming here, he even said to me,
    <br>"Don't tell me you are going to Nigeria just like that."
    <br>And I was like, "The thing is still there. I don't know when it is going to stop."
    <br>At least, I could perform my duties as a wife.
    <br>I realised that this was not ordinary.
    <br>I was motivated because my husband came here last year and man of God gave him a prophecy.
    <br>He said that there was a man who had a prostate cancer.
    <br>When he came back, he was fine, so I was highly motivated by that.
    <br>I told myself, "I am going to The SCOAN."
    <br>That was the main problem that brought me to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I finally came to The SCOAN, the man of God said,
    <br>"There is a woman who is bleeding and she also has piles."
    <br>I could feel deep in my spirit that I was the one the man of God was talking to.
    <br>I came out and the man of God confirmed it, by saying, "This is the woman I am referring to.
    <br>It is not guesswork."
    <br>After the service I was taken to the restroom.
    <br>Instantly...
    <br>I couldn't believe what happened, I thought it was a joke.
    <br>I wiped and there was nothing.
    <br>The bleeding stopped instantly.
    <br>That is the evidence of Jesus Christ - lives changed.
    <br>Since last Sunday, I was still using a pad, thinking it would still come out somehow.
    <br>Because this thing - what it did to me in the aircraft...
    <br>I had a packet of pads, with 8 of them inside.
    <br>I thought it was going to be enough for the trip.
    <br>I found out that it was like a tap was open and it kept flowing.
    <br>It even stained the chair of the aircraft.
    <br>I think I went to the toilet more than 6 times, as if I was working in the toilet.
    <br>I didn't know what to do.
    <br>As a woman, I had to try by all means to put myself together.
    <br>In Nigeria they call it 'packaging'.
    <br>I packaged myself well, just that people would not see.
    <br>When I packaged myself, I came out as if nothing had happened.
    <br>Then I would sit and then I heard... and I jumped out of my chair and ran back to the toilet.
    <br>That trip was not enjoyed because of this problem.
    <br>Today, people of God, I am here to tell you that the problem is over
    <br>and I thank God so much for the deliverance.
    <br>I am back to normal.
    <br>I am no more bleeding.
    <br>I felt the pigmentation of blood in my palms.
    <br>That was the first thing that happened to me,
    <br>that confirmed to me that indeed I have been delivered.
    <br>My word of advice will be:
    <br>People of God - put God first.
    <br>I am a Nigerian; I haven't seen my mother for 4 years,
    <br>but I chose to come here straight because I know what God means to me.
    <br>So, I came from the airport straight, believing that God will see me through
    <br>and indeed that happened.
    <br>So, if you want a divine turnaround, learn to put God first in all you do.
    <br>Can you tell us how are you now, concerning that piles?
    <br>People of God, I have to confirm this:
    <br>This piles sometimes made not to be able to sit straight.
    <br>I would be sitting one-sided.
    <br>I would even cross my legs, as if it was a style.
    <br>There was no style there.
    <br>I just sat one-sided just to make myself comfortable because it didn't allow me to sit straight.
    <br>From that day henceforth, I am healed.
    <br>No more piles, no more pains.
    <br>I can sit nicely like a lady.
    <br>Before, this is how I sat.
    <br>I would go this way and I would cross my legs
    <br>because I would avoid sitting with my back straight,
    <br>because the pain came straight from the inside.
    <br>But now I can sit nicely, as you can see.
    <br>I can even... - just for you see - nicely.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>When you have health challenges...
    <br>Most of us would agree with me that most of our prayer points would be "Breakthrough",
    <br>until you have health challenges.
    <br>You will not remember that "Breakthrough", you will push it aside,
    <br>and all you would be hearing, "Healing",
    <br>because only a person that is alive would look for money.
    <br>Praise God!
