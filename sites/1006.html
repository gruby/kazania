  <p>    
    <br>During a Sunday Service at The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message
    <br>in which he referred to February as being a peculiar month in the Southern African subregion.
    <br>These were his words...
    <br>Ending of February - very peculiar month in the Southern African subregion.
    <br>I will not say more than that.
    <br>It means they have to be steadfast in prayer.
    <br>Ending of February is a peculiar month in the Southern African subregion.
    <br>Let us observe prayer sessions in the beginning for the leaders.
    <br>Ending of February to April.
    <br>That is, from the ending of February to April.
    <br>Let us observe prayer sessions.
    <br>I will let you know of further messages as they are revealed to me.
