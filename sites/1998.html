    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Start your prayer by removing the barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God.
    <br>And what are the barriers?
    <br>Somebody may have hurt you in one way or another.
    <br>Somebody may have cheated you in one way or another.
    <br>Somebody may have embarrassed you in one way or another.
    <br>And the Bible says that whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold an offence.
    <br>Because He is your Counsellor, Deliverer, Commander - He is the One fighting for you.
    <br>You can't fight for yourself.
    <br>If anybody offends you, leave it for God; God will fight the person.
    <br>So, are you now to take it upon yourself and begin to hold offence, wanting to fight?
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right.
    <br>You are not given permission to hold offence.
    <br>By the time you remove this barrier, your heart will be free.
    <br>The Bible says, a free spirit attracts the Spirit of God.
    <br>If your heart is not free, it cannot attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>Your heart needs to be free.
    <br>Right now, viewers all over the world, open your lips and say, "Lord, I want to be released."
    <br>FLUSH IT OUT!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer
    <br>Viewers all over the world, between your heart and the Spirit of God,
    <br>whatever barrier needs to be removed -
    <br>the barrier could be offence, pain of the past, bitterness, jealousy or envy.
    <br>Right now, it is time to remove them by confessing them and asking God to help you.
    <br>How do we confess them? We confess them when we confess them with all our heart.
    <br>Viewers at home, confess your release.
    <br>Confess your release with all your heart.
    <br>You are released, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I say, "Be released, in the name of Jesus Christ".
    <br>The Lord said to me, "T.B. Joshua, look at the heart of your people".
    <br>Viewers at home, viewers all over the world, anywhere you are, I can see your heart.
    <br>You, heart - be released in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Listen! the Lord said to me, "T.B. Joshua, look at the heart of your people".
    <br>I can see your heart being released!
    <br>I can see your heart being released in the name of Jesus from bitterness, jealousy, anger,
    <br>hatred and resentment - be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself, I disconnect you.
    <br>That which satan used to connect you - I disconnect you.
    <br>That which satan used to connect your career, children and destiny -
    <br>I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That which satan used to connect your country, community, good health - I disconnect it!
    <br>Be disconnected, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Listen to me; I can see your heart being released.
    <br>I can see your spirit being released.
    <br>It is over to you now.
    <br>You just confess your release, say, "Thank You, Jesus" and believe with all your heart you are released.
    <br>There are some offences and barriers you don't know.
    <br>Ignorantly, you may not know that this is the hindrance, the barrier.
    <br>Knowingly or unknowingly, you are released!
    <br>When you are not released from this barrier, who are you talking to?
    <br>You can't talk to the Heavenly Father.
    <br>It means whatever you are going to say, you say it to the air.
    <br>You just talk to the air.
    <br>"Be healed..." - You are talking to yourself, to the air.
    <br>It is a very important prayer.
    <br>You have to be convinced and you have to believe you are released.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God - I can see it being removed!
    <br>You have not seen it, but I have seen it.
    <br>How will you see it now? By believing what I have said.
    <br>That is all; it is simple.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If a man is on a wheelchair and I say, "Be healed, in Jesus' name"
    <br>and I then say, "I can see you being healed", but the man has not seen himself being healed,
    <br>how would this man know?
    <br>By just taking my word.
    <br>"This man said it; let me follow what he said..."
    <br>By the time he follows what I said, he will realise that, "Ah yes, he has seen this before me."
    <br>So, you have been released!
    <br>If you call them gods from whom the word of God came, the Scripture, the Bible, cannot be broken.
    <br>Take this - right now, before we start, I can see you being released.
    <br>I repeat again: I can see you being released!
    <br>Are you saying this statement from your heart?
    <br>And you believe you are released?
    <br>Let us go.
    <br>Now, we want to break every yoke.
    <br>Because you can talk to God right now and God also can talk to you.
    <br>The barrier has been removed.
    <br>You can talk now; get ready to talk.
    <br>And you have to talk with all your heart; you mean what you say and God means what He says to you.
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Every familiar spirit tormenting your way, that disturbs you,
    <br>every familiar spirit that causes you pain, lust, failure, sickness and setback -
    <br>begin to rebuke them right now!
    <br>FLUSH IT OUT!!! | TB Joshua Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You just have to mean it and say it with all your heart.
    <br>When you say something with all your heart, your mouth is not needed - but your heart.
    <br>These familiar spirits, they cause pain.
    <br>These familiar spirits, they cause setback.
    <br>These familiar spirits, they cause failure.
    <br>These familiar spirits cause limitation in progress.
    <br>Familiar spirits...
    <br>Open your lips right now and begin to remove them on your way and curse them.
    <br>Prayer!

    <br>Leave in the name of Jesus!
    <br>These familiar spirits, they cause sickness, disease.
    <br>I say, you familiar spirits...

    <br>it could be your words, it could be your character, it could be your attitude, it could be your way.
    <br>Satan can use our words to connect us to himself.
    <br>Maybe you talk arrogantly, with hate or pride, you talk offence, you belittle people.
    <br>Satan will use that to connect you to himself.
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself - begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>Disconnect yourself!

    <br>- Through school; when she was in school.
    <br>I entered her through her sister.
