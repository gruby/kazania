    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>God With Us (Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is on our side
    <br>[who can be against us]
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, to identify and acknowledge our weakness is victory itself.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>For you to know where you need to grow is victory itself.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>That, "I am a smoker; I don't want to smoke",
    <br>and you begin to say, "Jesus!"
    <br>- this is 50 percent of the victory.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>What are your weak areas?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>Drugs?
    <br>Fear?
    <br>Greed?
    <br>Anger?
    <br>Alcohol?
    <br>Moral compromise?
    <br>What are yours?
    <br>Knowing that answer is 50 percent of the victory.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Knowing that answer is 50 percent of the victory".
    <br>Again.
    <br>Knowing that answer is 50 percent of the victory.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What are yours?"
    <br>We are here today because of the areas we need to grow in.
    <br>All of us have areas we need to grow in.
    <br>This means, there is no perfect being.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: KNOW YOURSELF
    <br>There is no such thing as a perfect being.
    <br>Such people do not exist.
    <br>This is why we pray and fast.
    <br>We pray the more and fast the more because of the areas we need to grow in.
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>We pray the more and fast the more because of that area we need to grow in.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the book of Matthew 26.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Let's look at Matthew 26:69.
    <br>"Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. But a servant girl came to him, saying,
    <br>'You were also with Jesus of Nazareth'".
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Verse 70 -  "But he denied it before them all ..."
    <br>This means, in the presence of the crowd.
    <br>"No! I do not know what you are saying," whereas he knew and he heard.
    <br>Verse 71 - "And when he had gone out to the gateway, another girl saw him and
    <br>said to those who were there, "This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth".
    <br>This is another witness.
    <br>Verse 72 - "But again he denied with an oath".
    <br>You see, "Over my dead body".
    <br>This time the man is not only denying by saying, "No, I do not know what you are saying". He said, [snaps his fingers].
    <br>You know.
    <br>People commonly snap their fingers at others deceptively.
    <br>"Over my dead body".
    <br>Verse 72 - "But again he denied with an oath, 'I do not know the Man!'".
    <br>"I do not know him".
    <br>"I cannot associate myself with Him".
    <br>Listen to Peter again.
    <br>Verse 73 - "And a little later those who stood by came up and said to Peter,
    <br>'Surely you also are one of them for your speech betrays you'.
    <br>This time around because this language is 'for your speech betrays you'.
    <br>Now listen, this time he said ...
    <br>Verse 74 - "He began to curse and swear, saying, 'I do not know this Man!'".
    <br>"Leave me!".
    <br>People commonly snap their fingers at others deceptively.
    <br>"I do not know him. God forbid bad things. As for me ... God is my witness".
    <br>Using God's name even while lying - "God is my witness".
    <br>Because of fear, Peter denied and raised curses on himself to deny Jesus.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: KNOW YOURSELF
    <br>Today, people say what is not the opinion of their conscience,
    <br>but the opinion of others.
    <br>People express what is not the testimony of their conscience,
    <br>but the opinion of others -
    <br>what they read,
    <br>what they hear.
    <br>Biblically, leadership is about drilling deep until we hit the bedrock.
    <br>Deep, deeper, deepest -  that is relationship.
    <br>The unique temptations of a Christian can be spelt out in five words -
    <br>fear, ego, pride, greed and moral compromise.
    <br>As we grow in responsibility,
    <br>as we grow in power,
    <br>as we grow in influence,
    <br>these temptations increase in our behaviour and in our character.
    <br>That is why you say, "My pastor was a very simple man in the beginning,
    <br>but now we cannot even talk to him; we cannot even reach him".
    <br>As we grow in responsibility,
    <br>as we grow in power,
    <br>as we grow in influence,
    <br>these temptations increase in our behaviour and in our character.
    <br>Because we allow the blessing of God to control us; not the source of the blessing.
    <br>No matter the position you occupy - president, governor, apostle -
    <br>if you are a man of the people you should be very accessible, but untouchable.
    <br>But when you are not accessible, you are afraid of 'touch', you are afraid of destruction.
    <br>But if God is your security and protection,
    <br>then you should be very accessible, but untouchable.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because we are man of people, not man of man.
    <br>The evidence that God is the One that put you in the position is your accessibility.
    <br>When you are available to the poor,
    <br>to the privileged,
    <br>less privileged,
    <br>you show that God is the One that placed you there.
    <br>The unique temptation of a Christian can be spelt out in five words -
    <br>ego, pride, greed, fear and moral compromise.
    <br>We allow the power to control us, not the Giver of the power.
    <br>When you allow authority or influence or the responsibility you have -
    <br>you have been given so much responsibility - it is that responsibility that controls you.
    <br>"I want to see you". You say, "I am too busy".
    <br>Who gave you the job?
    <br>Was it not God?
    <br>It is God that gives to us.
    <br>A tired mind cannot make any serious decision.
    <br>Biblical leadership is about drilling deep until you hit the bedrock.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Yes, the job is half done.
    <br>Rise up right now and confess.
    <br>Remember, a man may profess "I'm good" and not such in heart.
    <br>A man may profess, "Jesus is Lord" and not such in heart.
    <br>A man may confess, "Jesus is my Saviour" and not such in heart.
    <br>I want you to confess whom you are, matching your action to your words. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Matching your action to your words.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Matching your action to your words.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Matching your action to your words.
    <br>Doing what you say.
    <br>Once you are ready to do what you say, the job is half done.
    <br>Right now, it is time to confess whom you are.
    <br>If you have not known the Lord and you are here also to rededicate yourself, open your lips.
    <br>Say after me:
    <br>Lord, Jesus,
    <br>I'm a sinner.
    <br>Come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul today.
    <br>My Saviour,
    <br>thank You for my salvation.
    <br>My Deliverer,
    <br>thank You for my deliverance.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The job is half done!".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah. You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Here Jesus comes in.
    <br>If you confess what is in your heart, what you believe, here Jesus comes in,
    <br>to bring us to balance.
    <br>This is referred to as "born-again".
    <br>When you confess what is in your heart - the picture of your heart -
    <br>here Jesus comes in to bring you to balance.
    <br>So, the job is half done.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
