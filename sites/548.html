  <p>    
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team set off on one of their missionary journeys
    <br>to carry out works of charity in righteousness,
    <br>in obedience to the commands of our Lord, Jesus Christ to be our brothers' keeper.
    <br>They set off to those who are in dire need of the love, compassion, mercy, goodness and kindness of God.
    <br>It was on that same day that they visited an old man named Ajiboro Osunla,
    <br>who had been abandoned in a dark room for a very, very long time.
    <br>Opening the door revealed a small dark room in a deplorable state,
    <br>with a repulsive odour piercing the murky atmosphere.
    <br>A closer look revealed an elderly man lying on a dishevelled bed in a shocking condition.
    <br>His sight had greatly diminished, due to the darkness of the room,
    <br>in which he had been lying in for such a long time,
    <br>and his speech revealed that he was indeed very weak and feeble.
    <br>Let's hear from him.
    <br>My name is Ajiboro Osunla.
    <br>Please, can you take me away from here?
    <br>If you can take me away from here and take care of me, I will be grateful.
    <br>I am sick and I want to be healthy.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>There is nobody taking care of me.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Please if you can take me away from here today, I will be happy.
    <br>Did they lock you up in the room?
    <br>They have been locking me up in the room.
    <br>In his words:
    <br>"My name is Ajiboro Osunla.
    <br>Please, can you take me away from here?
    <br>Please, can you take me away from here and take care of me?
    <br>I would be very grateful.
    <br>I am sick.
    <br>I am sick and I want to be healthy.
    <br>There is nobody taking care of me.
    <br>Please, if you can take me away from here today, I would be very happy.
    <br>They had been locking me up in the room."
    <br>Put yourself in his position - rejected, isolated, abandoned,
    <br>and in dire need of someone who cares.
    <br>You can see the cobwebs hanging from the ceiling -
    <br>a further sign of the level of negligence this man has suffered.
    <br>The situation suggested there was no hope.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Is this where you urinate and excrete?
    <br>I have not been excreting.
    <br>I don't have food to eat so I have not been excreting.
    <br>It is only those who eat that can excrete.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>It is almost three months since I ate spicy food.
    <br>There is no food.
    <br>My children are in Lagos.
    <br>"I have not been excreting.
    <br>I don't have food to eat, so I have not been excreting.
    <br>It is only those who eat that can excrete.
    <br>It is almost three months since I ate spicy food.
    <br>There is no food.
    <br>My children are in Lagos.
    <br>Could this be true that the man who has living children
    <br>could be left to rot and die in such an isolated manner?
    <br>One would even wonder that such a man would be living in an entirely isolated environment.
    <br>But no.
    <br>He has neighbours, who do not seem to care whatever happens to him.
    <br>A practical demonstration was when the Emmanuel TV team approached one of his neighbours,
    <br>to please allow him into her apartment for a few minutes,
    <br>while they clean up his apartment
    <br>but she bluntly refused.
    <br>I can't put him in my room.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Our father here who is in a very terrible condition.
    <br>The room itself is in a deplorable condition.
    <br>Words cannot describe the seriousness of the situation here.
    <br>Everywhere is very very dirty.
    <br>It is not fit for living at all.
    <br>There is a terrible smell everywhere.
    <br>And we have learnt from our father that he has not been eating for the last three months
    <br>therefore he has not been excreting or going to the toilet at all.
    <br>He can hardly see, he has very poor vision and he is unable to walk far, or move about.
    <br>So, he stays alone, isolated and rejected in this very room.
    <br>The door is closed, no one comes to visit him, to see him.
    <br>He is left by himself completely and he is nearly a hundred years old, as it is now.
    <br>You can see some bread here, that our father has been eating slowly and slowly.
    <br>So, therefore you can see even the condition of his skin.
    <br>It is in a very terrible condition.
    <br>He is unable to move about.
    <br>He is very thin, very emaciated.
    <br>You can see even the clothes he is wearing;
    <br>you can hardly call them clothes, he has been wearing them for a very long time,
    <br>he has not been changing.
    <br>Basically, what we can see is skin and bones on a skeleton.
    <br>He has asked for our help, to relocate him, to move him to a different area
    <br>because this is not at all a conducive place for anyone to live.
    <br>If you were here right now, this is not a conducive place to live at all.
    <br>The room is very small, very tiny and there is a terrible smell.
    <br>Everywhere is dirty.
    <br>No one is here to take care of him.
    <br>There is no one to look after him, no one to take care of his needs, no one to provide for him.
    <br>He has barely been living, you can just call it 'existing',
    <br>here, with no one to talk to him and no one to look into his situation.
    <br>But we are here today on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team,
    <br>to let our father here know that someone does care - Jesus Christ cares for him.
    <br>And we have a gift.
    <br>This is the gift of 5,000 naira for you, sir,
    <br>and this is a bag of rice, to take care of your welfare and your needs.
    <br>You can see - the rice is here.
    <br>This is the bag of rice for you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>As our father has made a plea to be moved to a different position,
    <br>we are here to help him and we want to take care of him.
    <br>So, right now, we want to take him out of this environment into a new, better environment,
    <br>where it is conducive for him to live and stay, and enjoy his last years comfortably.
    <br>We want to invite the Emmanuel TV team forward to help our father here
    <br>move out of this environment.
    <br>We want to take you to another place now.
    <br>You want to take me now?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>But the work must go on, and it did.
    <br>As soon as the Emmanuel TV team revealed their intention to move the elderly man
    <br>to another place, he rejoiced.
    <br>His reaction: "You want to take me now?"
    <br>He was glad.
    <br>He continued to praise the name of the Lord, saying,
    <br>"Hallelujah! 
    <br>Glory be to God!"
    <br>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
    <br>Matthew 25:45 says,
    <br>"Jesus Christ said, 'Whatsoever you do, or fail to do to the least of my brethren,
    <br>that you do unto Me.' "
    <br>In other words, Jesus was saying here, "I have no farm where I expect you to work for Me,
    <br>or an office where I expect you to help Me in checking My files.
    <br>My farm and my office are your fellow brothers."
    <br>Here, the Emmanuel TV team responds to this instruction,
    <br>knowing that we serve God when we help our fellow brothers.
    <br>They have taken the man to another room, and they lay him on a reed mat,
    <br>saying he should relax, while they clean up his former room.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Look at the appalling squalor this aged man has been subjected to for such a long time.
    <br>There is rubbish and refuse all over the place.
    <br>Who knows when the room was last cleaned.
    <br>But the Emmanuel TV team are cleaning the inhabitable room right now.
    <br>Here is the Emmanuel TV team who is taking care of baba.
    <br>We can see the state he was in.
    <br>There are even insects on the mattress where he has been lying for the last number of years - bed bugs.
    <br>You can see the remains of the food, bread crumbs
    <br>on this very mattress where he has been lying.
    <br>Right now, we want to totally clean the room.
    <br>The team is removing the mattress now.
    <br>If you look under the bed, you can see the extent...
    <br>The bed is now being taken out.
    <br>You can see; this room has not been cleaned for a very long time - a number of years.
    <br>These are the items that have been found underneath.
    <br>The disinfectant is being sprayed everywhere.
    <br>Right now the team is brushing the room,
    <br>the room that has not been cleaned for such a long time.
    <br>When we came into this room, it was totally pitch-black.
    <br>There was no light.
    <br>Dirt was everywhere.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>This is the amount of dirt and rubbish that was found in this room,
    <br>which the Emmanuel TV team is now clearing out.
    <br>Viewers, if you could come into this room when we first walked in, the smell was absolutely terrible.
    <br>New cobwebs are being removed.
    <br>Earlier, some of them had gone down right to the bed, which is now being removed.
    <br>So, this is a total and thorough renovation.
    <br>The room was full of insects - different kinds of creatures who were thriving on the dirt and dust.
    <br>He was living in a world of his own, with no one to help, no one to care.
    <br>No hope.
    <br>These are human excrements that are being picked up from the floor here,
    <br>which had been lying there for such a long time,
    <br>with no one whatsoever to take care of our father's room and look after it.
    <br>Once again viewers - these are human excrements that you are seeing right here,
    <br>which have been lying under this bed for a very long time.
    <br>These are the human urine and excrements that stained the wall for such a long time,
    <br>with no one to help him to go to the toilet, his bed became the toilet.
    <br>He has been sleeping, eating and living in this condition for an extremely long time.
    <br>Right now it is being cleaned.
    <br>Viewers, just imagine what it is like to live in such a condition.
    <br>This is why it is so important to reach out and help these people,
    <br>to care for those who have no one else to care for them,
    <br>because if not, such a man would surely die living in such a condition,
    <br>if not the renovation and support of the Emmanuel TV team and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You can see now the colour of the water.
    <br>It shows the amount of human waste and urine.
    <br>He was sleeping in his own urine.
    <br>As Christians, we are called to respond to all human needs,
    <br>just as the Emmanuel TV team have responded to the need of our father here today.
    <br>Viewers, respond to the human needs in your community,
    <br>and let God use you as a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Right now the team is drying the floor that has just been washed.
    <br>Here we can see a new mattress that the Emmanuel TV team has purchased,
    <br>as we are relocating our father to a new environment which will be much more pleasant
    <br>and comfortable for him.
    <br>So you can see the new mattress is now being brought in, laid on the bed.
    <br>This mattress will be much more comfortable.
    <br>And now the bed is being laid with fresh sheets.
    <br>He will be much more comfortable, knowing that Someone does care,
    <br>and His name is Jesus.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Under the bed is clean, as opposed to before,
    <br>when there was a terrible amount of human waste, human urine
    <br>and bits of food and dead insects that were found underneath.
    <br>And now the smell that was so terrible when we entered the room has changed,
    <br>and is replaced with a clean and enjoyable smell,
    <br>which is a major difference.
    <br>How God of mercy and tender compassion uses His mighty power
    <br>for the relief of those who for no fault of theirs are oppressed and distressed.
    <br>But He has no hands but our hands to do His work today.
    <br>He wants to use your hands.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team demonstrates that whatever is in their hands
    <br>is a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>As the Emmanuel TV crew member lifts the aged man in compassion and love,
    <br>we are reminded that acts of charity and righteousness by faith in Christ Jesus go together.
    <br>Although the demonstration of love for the lonely and needy alone
    <br>is not enough to bring us to salvation,
    <br>it forms the basis for judging our level of kindness,
    <br>as turning the other way when our brother is in need
    <br>is equal to rejecting Christ Himself,
    <br>when you look the other way when your brother is in trouble.
    <br>You imagine you were only in the company of the poor, the weak,
    <br>the disadvantaged and contemptible people,
    <br>you will be made to know perhaps, when it will be too late
    <br>that it was Jesus Christ whom you denied.
    <br>What is in your hands, viewers?
    <br>What is your gift?
    <br>That is what the Lord will use to bless others through you.
    <br>It could be your time, strength, material, money,
    <br>every good thing the Lord has given you.
    <br>There are many sick people in the hospitals around you.
    <br>Go there, visit them and show love and compassion.
    <br>Pray for them, pray with them.
    <br>Who knows - that may be all that is needed for their recovery.
    <br>Who owns this bed?
    <br>It is a new bed.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Did you relocate me?
    <br>This is where you were before; they cleaned it and put a new bed.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>The following week, the Emmanuel TV team returned to the house
    <br>where Mr. Osunla was staying to respond to his earlier request to care for him.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Hello. This is Annette reporting for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Right with me here is one of the healthcare professionals
    <br>and we would like her to introduce herself to us.
    <br>Madam, please tell us your name and your profession.
    <br>My name is Hannah Iheanacho.
    <br>I'm a nursing sister.
    <br>I trained at L.U.T.H. - Lagos University Teaching Hospital.
    <br>I have 21 years experience in nursing.
    <br>So you are a nursing sister and you have had 21 years experience in nursing.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Have you had much experience in caring for elderly people?
    <br>Yes. I have been carrying for elderly people: I have experience in that.
    <br>We would like to introduce you to one of the elderly people that we have here;
    <br>it is one of our friends - Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team would actually like you,
    <br>due to your level of expertise, your years of experience as a nursing sister,
    <br>to undertake employment.
    <br>We would like to employ you as a nursing sister, to take care of Mr. Osunla
    <br>and other elderly members in this community.
    <br>Would you be happy to undertake the position?
    <br>Yes. I'm very happy. I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I'm happy to take care of Mr. Osunla and other elderly people in the community.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for that.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>We can see the painters at work.
    <br>We are now starting on the second coat to make this environment one
    <br>that is comfortable for a man to spend the last days in a comfortable environment.
    <br>We would like to say "thank you" to all those Emmanuel TV viewers
    <br>who have actually helped, reached out in compassion and generosity
    <br>and given a gift, time, effort, money and every other good thing that God has given to you.
    <br>Having laid a new floor, fitted new lighting and unloaded a new bed,
    <br>Mr. Osunla's room is steadily taking shape.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Various household appliances have been provided,
    <br>and they are now being carried into their new home.
    <br>They include a brand-new fridge, a colour television, a fan, a wheelchair,
    <br>all for the comfort and care of Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Just as Jesus Christ Himself is the solution to the problems of all mankind,
    <br>so expects us to be a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>We should build our Christian lives around this principle,
    <br>knowing that we serve God when we serve our fellow brothers.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Ultimately, we are called to respond to all human needs,
    <br>for that is what love entails.
    <br>There can be no loving without giving.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>We are now in the completed, decorated room of Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Many of you will remember before - this is the very spot where Mr. Osunla was found
    <br>in a very dark room, in a dishevelled state, in a deplorable condition.
    <br>But Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team came together with one vision
    <br>to make this a room that is fit for a human being.
    <br>And today we can see that vision has come to pass.
    <br>If you look around, you can see that now it is somewhere that is comfortable
    <br>for a man of his age to live.
    <br>They provided a fridge, a television, a comfortable bed,
    <br>a fan for the time when it is too hot.
    <br>Over here we have a wheelchair, which is called a commode wheelchair.
    <br>If we lift it up here - this will make it so much easier for Mr. Osunla to go to the toilet.
    <br>This wheelchair will be also able to take him outside for fresh air.
    <br>Because Mr. Osunla is doubly incontinent,
    <br>we have incontinence pads, which the nurse will be using to care for him.
    <br>Mr. Osunla also has a walking frame to assist him to walk.
    <br>This is basically being made available through Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV team to let Mr. Osunla know that Someone cares.
    <br>Someone cares for the weak ones, the abandoned ones, the rejected and lonely in society,
    <br>and His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>This is just one of the many homes, that Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team
    <br>have gone out to help.
    <br>There are many lonely, sick people in the society, that need the help of you, our viewers.
    <br>They need you to reach out in compassion to give what is in your hands.
    <br>Everybody has something big or small to plant.
    <br>It could be your love, your money, your time, your strength
    <br>and every other good thing that the Lord has given you.
    <br>We just pray that this shall be an encouragement for many, who are in a position to give,
    <br>to give that gift that God has given to you.
    <br>We believe that this is going to go some way to make Mr Osunla's life much more comfortable,
    <br>comparing to the previous life that he was living,
    <br>a life that was not even fit for an animal.
    <br>And we thank God.
    <br>This is truly the work of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Jesus Christ has made it possible.
    <br>All we have to say is "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Hello, madam.
    <br>We just want to see if we can ask you a few questions.
    <br>We can see that you are very busy at work here.
    <br>Can you just tell us exactly what you are doing?
    <br>I'm putting the mackintosh so that it will protect the bed sheet so that the baba will not soil it.
    <br>So this is a mackintosh, a plastic...
    <br>We call it "mackintosh", to protect the bed sheets.
    <br>With the transformation of the room complete,
    <br>it is time to take Mr. Osunla to his new home.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Lying on his new bed, Mr. Osunla receives a tender bathing from the specially trained nurse.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>A freshly cooked nutritious meal is served to Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Your food is ready.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Here is Mr. Osunla enjoying his sumptuous meal, with the aid of a carer.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Right now, we want to speak to one of the other carers, who is also involved with
    <br>taking care of Mr. Osunla.
    <br>We will just speak to her here.
    <br>Hello, madam. Just introduce yourself to our viewers.
    <br>You can just turn to the camera here and tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Aina.
    <br>And you are one of the carers that Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team
    <br>have employed to take care of Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Yes. I have come to take care of him, cooking and cleaning for him.
    <br>So, you are cooking for Mr. Osunla, cleaning and taking care of his needs.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>Are you happy to undertake this position?
    <br>Yes. I am very happy; I am very grateful to be taking care of him.
    <br>Mr. Osunla, how are you?
    <br>Someone who can help me like this - the God he serves, will be my God!
    <br>The church he attends is where I would like to worship.
    <br>Mr Osunla is saying that on Sunday he would love to go to church and worship and pray.
    <br>And we can see that baba has had a change of heart
    <br>and he has accepted Jesus Christ as His Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Who else could justly do it?
    <br>It is none other than Jesus Christ.
    <br>Baba, how are you?
    <br>I'm alright.
    <br>On our journey to various villages and towns to visit and help the needy,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV team discovered Mr. Osunla, an elderly man who was found abandoned
    <br>in a dark, filthy and foul-smelling room.
    <br>Sick, with no food to eat, undernourished, with his skin in a poor condition,
    <br>Mr. Osunla was confined to a bed, being unable to walk.
    <br>Neglected in this condition for such a long time,
    <br>he was also found to be nursing bedsores and in much pain.
    <br>Mr. Osunla in this poor and dishevelled state was clearly facing mental and physical imprisonment.
    <br>Due to his poor condition, Mr. Osunla was assessed to be in need of complete and total nursing care.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team, with the help of Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>therefore employed a qualified nurse and a care assistant
    <br>to take care of all of Mr. Osunla's medical and high-care needs.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Three months later, the Emmanuel TV team went back to visit Mr. Osunla
    <br>to find out his present state of health.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Mr. Osunla was found to be a completely new man.
    <br>With the help of medical care from the nursing staff and carer and Emmanuel TV support,
    <br>Mr. Osunla was now able to do what he could not do before.
    <br>You could tell by the state of Mr. Osunla's skin
    <br>that he was now well nourished and healthy, experiencing life anew.
    <br>Mr. Osunla appreciating and praying for the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>I pray God Almighty will continue to take care of you.
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Before | After
    <br>SHOCKING: A Testimony That Will Make You CRY!!!
    <br>Indeed, we have had lots of emails and lots of phone calls from our Emmanuel TV viewers,
    <br>who have actually been asking for Mr. Osunla and about his progress.
    <br>Well, today you have the opportunity to see for yourself the follow-up of this story.
    <br>Mr. Osunla is still being taken care of by the nurse and the assistant
    <br>and his needs are still being very much taken care of.
    <br>Baba, we are here again, on behalf of the Emmanuel TV crew and Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>We have another bag of rice for you and yet another cash gift
    <br>because we want to continue to support you.
    <br>It is a bag of rice.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I appreciate it.
    <br>Baba, we also have a cash gift for you.
    <br>This is a cash gift for you, baba - you hold that.
    <br>Thank You Jesus! May you live long, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you for taking good care of us.
    <br>Mr. Osunla has just been praying for the long life of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Baba, it is wonderful seeing you again.
    <br>Now free from bedsores and pain, Mr. Osunla is now able to turn himself
    <br>and move freely on the bed.
    <br>Not only that.
    <br>Mr. Osunla was found to be able to stand, and glory be to God, walk.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>You can now see Mr. Osunla walking, demonstrating his new found freedom.
    <br>Man is always in want of one thing or the other
    <br>but the moment we encounter Jesus Christ in our lives,
    <br>we would lack nothing and want nothing.
    <br>Jesus Christ has taken over his problem and given him joy.
    <br>As it says in the Book of Psalm 30:5, "Weeping may endure for a night,
    <br>but joy cometh in the morning."
    <br>A new life has dawned in the life of Mr. Osunla.
    <br>Indeed, a million thanks are not enough for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Instead of criticising our fellow men or our sick society,
    <br>we should do what is good to change the bad we see.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
