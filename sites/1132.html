  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you. Thank you for your time.
    <br>I hope you are enjoying your time.
    <br>Time with Jesus - wonderful!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>As I look at true believers, many Christians, I do not forget the many insults,
    <br>I do not forget the many persecutions,
    <br>I do not forget the many temptations they endure to maintain their Christian life.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Injustice, pain, the opposition they endure to maintain their walk with the Lord.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>I think I'm going to build my message this morning around this.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I'm going to call it, 'The Secret Of True Believers'
    <br>because it is my secret - people don't know.
    <br>They see it as pain; they see it as a punishment.
    <br>Like what Job's wife said to him, "You say, you are a friend of God, God loves you so much.
    <br>Why are you going through all this pain, all this agony?"
    <br>Job said to his wife, "Why are you saying this?
    <br>Someone gave you butter, salad and later now gave you bitter leaf.
    <br>Why can't you take it?"
    <br>We have been eating the salad for so long.
    <br>and when bitter leaf now comes, we should take it.
    <br>Life is both sides - positive and negative.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let's take our reading from the book of James 1:1-4.
    <br>That is our reading.
    <br>But in other books you will find this that will help you:
    <br>2 Corinthians 11. You take your reading from verse 23 to 29.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>And also the book of Matthew 10. Take your reading from 19 to 20.
    <br>That will also help in your reading.
    <br>1 Thessalonians 5. Take your reading from verse 1 to 10.
    <br>That will also help.
    <br>'The Secret Of True Believers' - your secret.
    <br>Of which you don't know that it is your secret. It is your weapon.
    <br>Why is it your weapon? - We talk about it today.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>James 1:1: "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings."
    <br>Trial and temptation - this is all we are hearing today.
    <br>Trial and temptation.
    <br>James 1:2: "Consider it pure joy..."
    <br>But today, we consider it as sorrow, crisis, pain.
    <br>But the Bible here says, "Consider it pure joy..."
    <br>Can you consider trial as pure joy?
    <br>Insult - pure joy?
    <br>Persecution - pure joy?
    <br>Opposition - pure joy?
    <br>This is what the Bible is saying here.
    <br>James 1:2: "...my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds"
    <br>Poverty, hardship, sickness, disease, stagnation could be your trial.
    <br>Okay?
    <br>James 1:3: "because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance."
    <br>James 1:4: "Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."
    <br>Take your time and read from that verse 4 down.
    <br>I have given you those books that will give this message today.
    <br>Lord Jesus, we thank You.
    <br>Let Your Word in our hearts.
    <br>You should be ready right now, the prayer point given to you the last two to three sundays.
    <br>Lord, release my spirit to follow You; I have surrendered.
    <br>Say to yourself, "Release my spirit, Lord, to follow You; I have surrendered".
    <br>Your heart is very important.
    <br>Your heart must be at its best for God.
    <br>Your heart cannot be at its best without being spiritual.
    <br>Your heart must be at its best because the Spirit expresses itself through the heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The Spirit of God expresses itself through my heart.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[The Spirit of God expresses itself through my heart.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[The Spirit of God expresses itself through my heart.]
    <br>Yes, the Spirit of God expresses itself through your heart.
    <br>That is why you must have freedom of your heart, a free heart - liberation.
    <br>You need it because the Spirit expresses itself through your heart.
    <br>Can you see the connection of your heart?
    <br>Your heart is His prayer room, strong room.
    <br>Why is it secret? - It is your secret.
    <br>Couldn't you hear? - Let your trial be a joy.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>In life, we do have days, weeks, months and years that come with enormous challenges -
    <br>poverty, hatred, persecution, insults and so on and so forth.
    <br>What do we do as Christians when they come?
    <br>Believers may have challenges but our challenges are not like others.
    <br>As a believer, you may have challenges.
    <br>You know what I mean by 'challenges' - they could be sickness, poverty, could be this or that.
    <br>Our challenges are not like others.
    <br>They are to strengthen our desire and determination for God,
    <br>to improve us, not impair us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What do we do as Christians when they come?
    <br>The Bible says, "Watch and pray".
    <br>In one of the verses I gave you.
    <br>"Watch and pray."
    <br>How can you watch and pray?
    <br>It means you must discipline your heart before prayer.
    <br>You cannot watch for God without a disciplined heart.
    <br>'Watch and pray' means you must discipline your heart before prayer.
    <br>How do we discipline our heart?
    <br>Something that does not qualify for meditation does not qualify for conversation.
    <br>I'm telling you the process.
    <br>What are you meditating?
    <br>What does not qualify for your heart does not qualify for your mouth.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>What does not qualify for meditation does not qualify for conversation -
    <br>means, speak what you believe, say what you believe.
    <br>If I say, "Stand up for prayer!", if you don't believe, don't stand up.
    <br>If I say, "Sit down!", if you don't believe, stand!
    <br>But today, when I say, "Stand up!" - "Hm, man of God said, 'Stand up!'." You will stand up.
    <br>When I say, "Let us pray!" - you don't believe, yet you pray.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus!" - you don't believe and say, "Amen!"
    <br>"In Jesus' name!" - you don't believe what I'm saying and you say, "Amen!"
    <br>The whole thing has now become a national anthem.
    <br>Faith is not a hobby. We take our faith as a hobby.
    <br>There is no alternative for our faith.
    <br>How can we discipline our heart?
    <br>We submit to panic and you say you are a Christian.
    <br>When I say, "Hey, there is a lion somewhere there!", you say, "Where?"
    <br>That is the question you ask me - "Where?"
    <br>And I say, "There!"
    <br>Mere hearing the roaring - "Where is my bag?"
    <br>From that moment, you will not close your eyes for prayer again.
    <br>If I say, "Let us pray!", you say, "No, I cannot!"
    <br>Because a lion is around, you have to...
    <br>"In Jesus' name. Amen."
    <br>If the lion comes close, you say, "T.B. Joshua, the prayer has not sent the lion away.
    <br>It is still very close".
    <br>If the lion now kicks the door, you will abandon me here.
    <br>We should be still and not submit to panic.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>"Let us pray."
    <br>"Rise up and let us pray."
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>My brother is looking at the other brother, "When will you stand up?"
    <br>We believe in majority instead of God's authority.
    <br>"Let us stand up for prayer."
    <br>Okay, good!
    <br>Sit down.
    <br>By what authority are you doing this?
    <br>Authority that I put on suit!
    <br>Authority that I'm standing in front of you!
    <br>"Let us respect this man and stand up."
    <br>That is it.
    <br>If not, you don't believe what to say.
    <br>We should be still and not submit to panic.
    <br>That is our problem.
    <br>When you have a little pain in your heart - "Ey."
    <br>"What happened?"
    <br>"Ah, the thing has started."
    <br>"What started?"
    <br>And begin to do the right thing.
    <br>It is when you are still and not panicked that you can begin to do the right thing.
    <br>You don't do the right thing in a panic moment.
    <br>We should take control of our situation instead of being afraid.
    <br>Take control instead of being what? - Afraid.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sometimes discouraged but not defeated
    <br>Cast down but not destroyed
    <br>There are times I don‘t understand
    <br>But I believe it‘s turning around for me
    <br>I’ve had struggles and disappointments
    <br>There are times I felt so alone
    <br>Some of my friends they let me down
    <br>But I still believe it’s turning around for me
    <br>Around for me around for me
    <br>Around for me it’t turning around for me
    <br>I can see the breaking of day
    <br>God is making a way
    <br>A change is coming for me
    <br>If I stand strong and believe
    <br>There's no reason to doubt
    <br>I know He's working it out
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>And it won't always be like this
    <br>The Lord will perfect that concerning me
    <br>And sooner or later it will turn in my favour
    <br>It's turning around for me
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>That song hit you.
    <br>It hit you.
    <br>You must take control of your situation instead of being afraid
    <br>because satan himself, the cause of crises and challenges, has been defeated.
    <br>Yes, that is what you should know.
    <br>The cause of those challenges you are facing -
    <br>poverty, sickness, disease, affliction, stagnation, temptation, persecution, opposition -
    <br>the cause, satan, has been defeated.
    <br>When adversity comes, as a true believer, welcome it.
    <br>True believers greet adversity as a friend, greet challenges as friends.
    <br>Whatever it is, greet as a friend.
    <br>That you are a believer, you may have affliction, challenges
    <br>but your challenges are not like others.
    <br>We must learn that there is value in the challenges.
    <br>The situation that looks impossible - there is value.
    <br>There can be no promotion without examination.
    <br>There is value in the situation that looks impossible.
    <br>That is why people like me can be here today.
    <br>True believers must have determination not to listen to the panic of the moment
    <br>but to find the quiet voice of counsel.
    <br>Pause and listen to what the Holy Spirit has to say concerning the matter.
    <br>That sickness may be to stop you awhile in order to prepare you for a new level in life.
    <br>That stagnation may be to reprepare you, to redirect you, to improve you.
    <br>It's a transit point to connect you.
    <br>Transit point - when you are going country to country,
    <br>there is a place where you have to stop to connect your flight.
    <br>That is the challenges to connect you to the future you desire.
    <br>Transit what? - Transit point.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we listen to the Holy Spirit, He will protect us from the pitfalls of every enemy.
    <br>Continuously praying in the spirit and listening to His voice
    <br>will protect you from your daily challenges.
    <br>I know a place I can always run to
    <br>In times of distress, confusion and fear
    <br>But when my enemy surrounds me
    <br>Father I know I'm free
    <br>For You keep me and guide me
    <br>In the shadow of Your wings
    <br>In the shadow of Your wings I know I am safe
    <br>In the shadow of Your wings I find relief
    <br>For You will hold me and You'll guide me
    <br>With Your righteous hand
    <br>I find rest, peace of mind
    <br>In the shadow of Your wings
    <br>In the shadow of Your wings I know I am safe
    <br>In the shadow of Your wings I find relief
    <br>For You will hold me and You'll guide me
    <br>With Your righteous hand
    <br>I find rest, peace of mind
    <br>In the shadow of Your wings
    <br>I am safe in the shadow of Your wings
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>In our daily challenges, you need to find enough calm to think clearly and react diligently
    <br>and not submit to panic.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The challenges we are facing is just this: Our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.
    <br>When our heart is not in one accord with our mouth, whom are we talking to?
    <br>It is when our heart is in one accord with our mouth, then, we can bring Jesus on the scene.
    <br>Then, we can bring the Holy Spirit, Spirit of the Father into our hearts.
    <br>When we say, "Jesus!", our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.
    <br>"Amen!" - our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.
    <br>"Hallelujah!" - our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.
    <br>So, can you see? All what we are doing?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Did you pray for the situation you are in today?
    <br>Did you?
    <br>Did you confess the situation you are in today?"
    <br>It is what we have been saying, what you have been saying in the name of Jesus
    <br>is not such in heart.
    <br>What you have been saying in the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus,
    <br>"Amen", every day, is not such in heart.
    <br>So, this is what I mean.
    <br>Our heart is not in one accord with our mouth when it comes to God's Word.
    <br>Speak in the name of Jesus! Shout in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Our heart is not in one accord with our mouth.
    <br>Did you pray for this situation you are facing today?
    <br>This means, what you have been saying - "In the name of Jesus!" - is not such in heart.
    <br>No! It is not such in heart!
    <br>"In the name of Jesus! Father, bless me!
    <br>Father, give me this! Father, give me that!"
    <br>What you are saying is different from what is in your heart.
    <br>We begin to bring Jesus on the scene
    <br>or bring the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Father into our heart,
    <br>when what we are saying is in one accord with our heart.
    <br>Like I have said:
    <br>As I look at true believers, I do not forget the many insults, persecutions, hatred,
    <br>temptation, opposition they endure to maintain their Christian life.
    <br>I salute them.
    <br>We are soldiers in the army
    <br>We have to fight or we have to die
    <br>We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
    <br>We've got to hold it up until we die
    <br>We are soldiers in the army
    <br>We have to fight or we have to die
    <br>We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
    <br>We've got to hold it up until we die
    <br>We are soldiers in the army
    <br>We have to fight or we have to die
    <br>We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
    <br>We've got to hold it up until we die
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All the soldiers in the house, let me see your hands up!
    <br>One more time!
    <br>We are soldiers in the army
    <br>We have to fight or we have to die
    <br>We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
    <br>We've got to hold it up until we die
    <br>Let me hear you say:
    <br>We are soldiers in the army
    <br>We have to fight or we have to die
    <br>We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
    <br>We've got to hold it up until we die
    <br>The Church is marching on
    <br>The Church is marching on
    <br>The gates of hell shall not prevail
    <br>The Church is marching on
    <br>The Church is marching on
    <br>The gates of hell shall not prevail
    <br>The Church is marching on
    <br>We are soldiers in the army
    <br>We have to fight or we have to die
    <br>We have to hold up our Saviour's banner
    <br>We've got to hold it up until we die
    <br>You may be seated. Did you listen to that?
    <br>As I look at true believers, I do not forget the many insults, persecutions, hatred,
    <br>temptation, opposition they endure to maintain their Christian life,
    <br>to walk with the Lord.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These challenges force us to look deeper.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "These challenges force us to look deeper".
    <br>Tell your neighbour what he does not want to hear and see what will happen.
    <br>Okay. Say to your neighbour, "Your mouth is smelly".
    <br>These challenges force us to look deeper, explore possibilities,
    <br>increase our desire and determination for God,
    <br>pray and dream of other ways that might have been ignored.
    <br>Can you see the value in crises, challenges?
    <br>Just say to your neighbour, "Hey! Please, you are smelly!" and see what your neighbour will say.
    <br>By what he is saying, it will tell you, you will know that he is not a Christian.
    <br>But now he is a Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Now, you are a Christian.
    <br>Let challenges come and see whether you are a Christian".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These challenges force us to look deeper.
    <br>Tomorrow, just look for your best friend.
    <br>Give him a test.
    <br>Just come and say, "Ha, I never knew you were a thief".
    <br>"I'm a thief? I'm taking you to the court!"
    <br>"My brother, come! It is not like that!"
    <br>Challenges force us to look deeper.
    <br>"I never knew you were not my friend."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Without being tested, as a Christian, our genuineness cannot be determined.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your genuineness cannot be determined without being tested".
    <br>Test by what?
    <br>By joy?
    <br>By food?
    <br>By blessing?
    <br>By breakthrough? What is that test?
    <br>Tell your neighour, "Without being tested, as a true believer, your genuineness cannot be determined.
    <br>You are not here today because of miracles you have seen so far.
    <br>You are not here today because of prophecies God is using me to perform.
    <br>No! You are not here because of crusades all over the world.
    <br>You are here because after sitting down,
    <br>"Ah, what this man has gone through - he is a man of God!"
    <br>No human being has gone through that and succeeded.
    <br>Did you listen to me?
    <br>You are not here because of the miracles.
    <br>You are not here because of prophecies or what you have seen on Emmanuel TV so far.
    <br>You are here because after sitting down and saying,
    <br>"Ha, he is not a human being! The man is a spirit!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Without being tested, as a Christian, your genuineness cannot be determined.
    <br>As a believer, we must understand that when times are stable
    <br>and the sea is calm and secure, no one is really tested.
    <br>When the oceans rise and thunders roar
    <br>I will soar with You above the storm
    <br>Father You are King over the flood
    <br>I will be still and know You are God
    <br>When the oceans rise and thunders roar
    <br>I will soar with You above the storm
    <br>Father You are King over the flood
    <br>I will be still and know You are God
    <br>Hide me now under Your wings
    <br>Cover me within Your mighty hand
    <br>When the oceans rise and thunders roar
    <br>I will soar with You above the storm
    <br>Father You are King over the flood
    <br>I will be still and know You are God
    <br>When the oceans rise and thunders roar
    <br>I will soar with You above the storm
    <br>Father You are King over the flood
    <br>I will be still and know You are God
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We must understand that when times are stable
    <br>and the sea is calm and secure, no one is really tested.
    <br>Many abandon their faith because of challenges.
    <br>Many are running helter skelter.
    <br>The devil gets people to his side because of trouble.
    <br>When the trouble comes, the devil will say to you, "Can you see?
    <br>You say you are serving God. Can you see?
    <br>Where is your God?
    <br>God of crises? God of challenges?
    <br>God of tribulation? God of stagnation?
    <br>God of joblessness? Where is that God?"
    <br>In contrast, poverty, hardship, sickness, disease, stagnation, just name them
    <br>force us to come face to face with who we really are and what we can become.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier.]
    <br>Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier.
    <br>What do I mean? Match your actions with your words if you want to succeed in life.
    <br>I'm no longer a slave to fear
    <br>I am a child of God
    <br>You unravel me with a melody
    <br>You surround me with a song
    <br>Of deliverance from my enemies'
    <br>'Til all my fears are gone
    <br>I'm no longer a slave to fear
    <br>I am a child of God
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier.
    <br>I mean, match your action with your word.
    <br>Your action is different from your word.
    <br>The action is heart; the word is mouth.
    <br>Your heart is different from your mouth; that is why your life is like this.
    <br>You find yourself in the situation you are in today because your heart is different from your mouth.
    <br>Match your action with your word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Match your action with your word.]
    <br>"In Jesus' name", "Jesus is this", "Jesus is that" - are you what you are saying?
    <br>"Amen!" - do you mean it?
    <br>"Amen! In Jesus' name, be healed!" - do you mean what you are saying?
    <br>Match your actions with your words.
    <br>Apply yourself to your duty, apply yourself to your work, as a Christian soldier.
    <br>Viewers, thank you for your time.
    <br>Now, you know your position when it comes to challenges.
    <br>You know your position when it comes to temptation.
    <br>You now know your position as a Christian when it comes to tribulation.
    <br>Now, you know your position when it comes to stagnation.
    <br>You know your position when it comes to temptation.
    <br>Here you are.
    <br>Temptation and challenges are your friends.
    <br>It is time now you begin to see the value in the challenges.
    <br>See the value in the situation that looks impossible.
    <br>There is value there.
    <br>I'm a good example.
    <br>Here I am.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Those of you who were crying for me in the past, now you can see.
    <br>Cry no more!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You never knew my situation didn't demand for crying.
    <br>Your sickness is to force you to look deeper.
    <br>Look deeper when sickness comes.
    <br>When hardship comes, look deeper.
    <br>Whatever you are facing, look deeper.
    <br>It is time to explore possibilities.
    <br>It will increase our desire and determination for God.
    <br>Pray and dream of other ways that might have been ignored.
    <br>I bless you. Thank you.
