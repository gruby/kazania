    <br>USE YOUR FAITH TO PUT A DEMAND - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The presence of God here is awesome.
    <br>It is thick.
    <br>I can feel it.
    <br>USE YOUR FAITH TO PUT A DEMAND - T.B. Joshua
    <br>It is like a cloud.
    <br>When the cloud is coming down on you - like during the transfiguration.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I can feel the presence of God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>USE YOUR FAITH TO PUT A DEMAND - T.B. Joshua
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The anointing is present.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>The power of God is present to heal you.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>The power of God is present to heal me.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We are in His presence.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You have to use your faith to put a demand.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Use your faith to put a demand".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>God has given us the gift of faith for this purpose.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God has given me the gift of faith for this purpose".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[God has given me the gift of faith for this purpose.]
    <br>You are to use your faith to put a demand.
    <br>Faith is a channel through which the anointing flows.
    <br>Faith is like a light switch that starts the electricity flow.
    <br>Look; I'm enjoying this - can you see?
    <br>It is like what?
    <br>A light switch.
    <br>A light switch that starts the electricity flow - that is faith.
    <br>That is faith for you.
    <br>It is like a starter.
    <br>It is like what?
    <br>It's like the starter on a car - that is faith.
    <br>If the anointing is present here, the power of God is here to heal you.
    <br>You must put your faith to what?
    <br>Heal me, oh Lord; I will be healed.
    <br>Save me, oh Lord; I will be saved.
    <br>Bless me, oh Lord; I will be blessed.
    <br>Deliver me, oh Lord; I will be delivered.
    <br>You believe that?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>USE YOUR FAITH TO PUT A DEMAND - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I am here now and there is nothing I can do without faith.
    <br>Faith releases the many apostolic gifts,
    <br>prophetic gifts, pastoral gifts and evangelical gifts.
    <br>Without faith, there is nothing I can do.
    <br>Let's look at the word 'faith' - how people really were in faith.
    <br>Acts 5:14.
    <br>"And believers were increasingly added to the Lord,
    <br>multitudes of both men and women,
    <br>so that they brought the sick out into the streets
    <br>and laid them on beds and couches,
    <br>that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them".
    <br>They are talking of shadow - can you see the word 'faith' there?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Acts 5:16.
    <br>"Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem,
    <br>bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits,
    <br>and they were all healed."
    <br>We can see people coming from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem.
    <br>Where there is no demand, there is no supply.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>It is not normal.
    <br>The day you discover that what I'm looking for is not where I'm going,
    <br>you will be very disappointed.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>Where there is a demand, there is a supply.
    <br>USE YOUR FAITH TO PUT A DEMAND - T.B. Joshua
    <br>There is enough anointing available to heal you here.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>What do you need now?
    <br>[Faith!]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Faith!]
    <br>The Bible says, 'We can see many coming to see Jesus'.
    <br>Why were they coming to see Him?
    <br>Where there is a demand, there is a supply.
    <br>USE YOUR FAITH TO PUT A DEMAND - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Because there was enough available anointing to heal them.
    <br>There was enough available anointing to deliver them.
    <br>There was enough available anointing to save them.
    <br>That was why you saw them rushing there.
    <br>If you have been going to a place
    <br>and you later discovered that what you are looking for is not there,
    <br>you would be very mad.
    <br>USE YOUR FAITH TO PUT A DEMAND - T.B. Joshua
    <br>There is enough available anointing to deliver you.
    <br>Put your faith to a demand.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>As I told you, faith is a gift.
    <br>God has given us this faith for this purpose.
    <br>I am here today; I cannot do anything without faith.
    <br>Faith releases many apostolic gifts.
    <br>Faith releases many prophetic gifts.
    <br>Faith releases many evangelical gifts.
    <br>Faith is a channel through which the anointing flows,
    <br>like a light switch that starts the electricity flow.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>I know your faith is lifted up.
    <br>Let me see your faith!
    <br>Let me hear your faith!
    <br>Let me hear faith talk!
    <br>Let me see the joy of faith!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Faith is a channel through which the anointing flows.
    <br>I have given you those examples.
    <br>It's like a starter on a vehicle - that is faith.
    <br>Without this, the vehicle cannot move.
    <br>Like a light switch that starts the electricity flow - that is faith.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>The presence of God is here; I can feel it.
