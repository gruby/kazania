  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Good Morning once again.
    <br>I want to say, 'Good Morning' to the viewers all over the world.
    <br>I don't see myself leaving the word faith.
    <br>So let us begin where we stopped the last message.
    <br>Talk on faith.
    <br>Let's take our reading from the Book of Matthew - that is the first book of the New Testament.
    <br>Open to chapter 21, verse 18.
    <br>Jesus cursed a fig tree.
    <br>"Early in the morning, as Jesus was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.
    <br>Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves.
    <br>Then he said to it, 'May you never bear fruit again!'"
    <br>Because he could not find anything on the tree, except leaves.
    <br>"Then he said to it, 'May you never bear fruit again!' Immediately the tree withered.
    <br>When the disciples saw this, they were amazed."
    <br>What a manner of man is this?
    <br>'How did the fig tree wither so quickly?' they asked.
    <br>Jesus replied, 'Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt,
    <br>not only can you do what was done to the fig tree
    <br>but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go throw yourself into the sea and it will be done'."
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>The last verse. Are you there?
    <br>That is verse 22.
    <br>"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask in prayer."
    <br>Can that be true of you?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask in prayer."
    <br>Can that be true of you?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask. Ask your neighbor, "Can that be true of you?"
    <br>The Bible says, "If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask in prayer". Can that be true of you?
    <br>Can that be true of you?
    <br>The word 'believe' is not an application but faith is an application.
    <br>Faith is a demonstration. Faith is a conviction. Faith is an application.
    <br>You want to apply.
    <br>We can only apply all of God's blessings through faith.
    <br>If you say you believe, show me your faith.
    <br>"I believe" - show me your faith.
    <br>This is a question of the heart.
    <br>This is a question of what? - The heart.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>You may believe and not be able to express your faith.
    <br>Anyone can believe but not everyone can express their faith.
    <br>Many claim that they are believers, but they do not know how to believe and express their faith.
    <br>That is what is going on all over the world.
    <br>Everyone here says that they are believers; if they ask you - "I am a believer."
    <br>But they do not know how to believe and express your faith!
    <br>Faith is an application. Faith is a demonstration. Faith is a conviction. Faith is practical.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, I can see this fruit - that is belief.
    <br>Yes, this is fruit in my hand - that is faith.
    <br>That is you and Jesus.
    <br>I will demonstrate again, your relationship with Jesus; those who claim they are believers.
    <br>Yes, that is fruit, I believe it is fruit.
    <br>Yes! It is fruit, this is fruit, it is fruit.
    <br>The word faith now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is faith now - you have faith to take it.
    <br>Without faith, you will continue to see the power, deliverance and all of God's blessings.
    <br>But you will not be able to apply them to yourself or make them manifest in you.
    <br>It is by faith we make all of God's blessings manifest in us.
    <br>By faith, we can apply all of God's blessings.
    <br>Faith is a question of the heart - whom we trust.
    <br>You can say, "I believe", but you believe not with your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>For every matter, there are promises in the Bible - that God will do for us as long as we have faith.
    <br>Work without faith is dead, in the same way faith without work is dead.
    <br>What we do expresses what we believe.
    <br>The matter is quite simple - faith is expressed through work.
    <br>Faith works together with its work; by this, faith is perfected, proved and completed.
    <br>If you say you believe, where is your faith?
    <br>Faith is practical.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith.
    <br>The belief in our heart can only be released by faith; if not, your belief will remain dormant, inactive.
    <br>Ok, you can believe but it is dormant.
    <br>If our belief remains dormant, what is dormant? It is what?
    <br>If you say you have money and you cannot spend it, do you have money?
    <br>Can you say you have money?
    <br>Because you will need money - it means you will be borrowing money.
    <br>When you have money and you cannot spend it, it means you will be borrowing money.
    <br>You will become a debtor.
    <br>So, the belief in our heart can only be released by faith.
    <br>When you don't have faith, the belief in your heart will remain dormant.
    <br>Are you a Christian?
    <br>When there is no faith, the belief in your heart will remain dormant.
    <br>So how will you call Jesus, how will you talk to Jesus when the belief in your heart is dormant?
    <br>"In Jesus name" - you need faith but there is no faith to release the belief.
    <br>You can only say, 'Amen' - by faith you release the belief in your heart
    <br>but it is not released.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" - you can only say this when faith releases the belief in your heart
    <br>but the belief in your heart is dormant.
    <br>This is why I said, many claim to be believers but do not know how to believe and express their faith.
    <br>They claim to be believers but they do not know how to believe and express their faith.
    <br>You believe in God in a certain matter.
    <br>You should have the work of faith in that matter.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "If you believe in God in a certain matter, you should have the work of faith in that matter".
    <br>Faith without work is dead. It means without the work of faith, that belief is dead.
    <br>What is the work of faith? That is the question.
    <br>The work of faith can simply be defined in this way:
    <br>Absolute trust in God that He is now working out the answer.
    <br>That is the work of faith - absolute trust in God that He is now working out the answer.
    <br>That is the work of faith!
    <br>If a man says he believes that God is working for him,
    <br>but he is busy making his own plans, worrying and distressed, this is false faith.
    <br>I am about to go out and I realise that the cloud is dark and it is about to rain.
    <br>I now move into my bedroom and begin to pray,
    <br>"Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, I don't want this rain, I want to go to my work,
    <br>Lord Jesus, help me stop this rain. Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Then I say, "God has answered my prayer" and I now move
    <br>and say to my family, "Thank you, I am going to work. It will not rain I have prayed to God.
    <br>God said to me it will not rain" and at the same time I move towards an umbrella.
    <br>and I put it inside my bag, and I say, "Thank You, Jesus" and go to work.
    <br>What does that umbrella mean?
    <br>In case of what? [It rains]
    <br>That has nullified my what? [My belief]
    <br>My belief.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That alone has nullified my belief.
    <br>Because if I actually believe in a certain matter, I must have the work of faith in that matter.
    <br>Carrying an umbrella is not the work of faith.
    <br>The work of faith is an absolute trust in Him that He is now working out the answer.
    <br>Is that not the life we live?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You pray over some trouble which arises in your life,
    <br>and later you find yourself full of anxiety and worries, as if you have never prayed before.
    <br>Prayer should be followed by an absolute trust in Him that He is now working out the answer.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "Prayer should be followed by an absolute trust in God
    <br>that He is now working out the answer".
    <br>Yes, after you finish praying, what should follow? Absolute trust.
    <br>"Jesus, Jesus, thank You, Lord, thank You, Lord" - what are you thanking Him for
    <br>when you know He has not answered your prayer?
    <br>If you know you have not received, why are you saying, "Thank You, Jesus"
    <br>because every prayer ends by what?
    <br>If you have not received teaching, the promise of the Father, the Holy Spirit, in your spirit,
    <br>forcing yourself to do such acts is indeed a risk.
    <br>That is where your problem comes from - forcing yourself to do such acts is indeed a risk.
    <br>I believe that many of us have not received the promise of the Father in our spirit.
    <br>You need to be grounded in the Word of God.
    <br>Faith comes by hearing.
    <br>Since we have not heard and obeyed enough, you cannot act faith.
    <br>That is where our problem comes from.
    <br>You might have heard the Word but you have not obeyed what you heard.
    <br>You hear it to teach it; you hear it to practice it, not hearing it to live it.
    <br>Like the father of the demon-possessed boy - he said, "I believe, help my unbelief".
    <br>He was acting like us then.
    <br>He was acting like us, that is why he said to Jesus, "I believe, help my unbelief".
    <br>That kind of belief is like the belief we have today.
    <br>This is what the father of the demon-possessed boy said to Jesus,
    <br>"I believe, help my unbelief" - what kind of belief again?
    <br>If you believe and you are asking to help your unbelief,
    <br>it means the belief he had was a kind of hearing the Word of God to preach and to teach,
    <br>not to live the Word.
    <br>If you hear the Word of God and live it, you will act faith.
    <br>So, this is why we keep seeing the present darkness.
    <br>Physical eyes will always and continue to see the present darkness
    <br>and the eyes of faith will always see the light.
    <br>The present darkness is the situation you are in now, your challenges are the present darkness.
    <br>This is the only thing you can see, you can't see beyond your situation.
    <br>That is why you lament, cry, doubt, become sober, have anxiety, worry
    <br>because all you can see is your present darkness.
    <br>You cannot see beyond your present darkness.
    <br>Assuming you have faith, you will be able to see the light.
    <br>Physical eyes can only see what? Present darkness.
    <br>Our sight can only see the present darkness but the eyes of faith can see the light.
    <br>And what is the present darkness? Your situation right now.
    <br>I call it present darkness because as soon as you change, you have faith,
    <br>you are converted through conversion, it is gone
    <br>because it is not something that is going to permanent.
    <br>Once you change, the situation changes.
    <br>That is why I call it present darkness.
    <br>Your sight can only see the present darkness.
    <br>And this is what you are seeing and is worrying you - you are thinking of this,
    <br>of hardship, limitation, poverty, sickness, infirmity, of the message you received,
    <br>nightmare, the phone call you received - this is your present darkness you are battling with
    <br>and as a result of your sight.
    <br>If I lived the way you are living, you would not meet me here today.
    <br>Situations, challenges, what you people have done to me and what you people are thinking of doing to me -
    <br>it will not allow me to stand here to address you because I would be worried, thinking.
    <br>But I cannot see my present darkness at all, all I see is light.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And now that I am only seeing the light, it means that God is going to take care of
    <br>any darkness that appears to be darkness.
    <br>But you are seeing them and they are disturbing you,
    <br>you are being disturbed by your challenges and by all sorts of situation - you are worried.
    <br>Even when Jesus stands by you and you are seeing your present darkness - you will be worried.
    <br>"How will I go about it, what is going to happen next?
    <br>I don't know what will happen, will I overcome this situation?
    <br>How will I overcome the situation? The nightmare is too much, I am having pain,
    <br>my doctor says I should go and write my will, this is a deadly disease; what will I do about it?
    <br>This is debt - how will I pay this debt?
    <br>I don't know how to pay, there is no future, no hope.
    <br>Everything seems so rough."
    <br>Under that atmosphere, you cannot have faith - you cannot express your faith, it is not possible.
    <br>You can only express your faith when you see the light,
    <br>but seeing the present darkness, it is difficult to express your faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith demands for a free spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbor.
    <br>[Faith demands for a free spirit.]
    <br>But your spirit is not free; your spirit is in bondage, in prison.
    <br>Free spirit. Faith demands for a free spirit but your spirit is not free.
    <br>Your spirit is not free.
    <br>You need a free spirit to attract God.
    <br>So, this is why I said, since you have not received the promise of the Father in your spirit
    <br>or you have not been grounded in the Word of God -
    <br>to be grounded in the Word of God is to have your spirit join itself with God's Spirit.
    <br>That will now declare you a true born again. Not the kind of born again we talk about today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is a question of the heart: Whom do you trust?
    <br>This is why we need to struggle to believe.
    <br>And there is no need for us to struggle to believe.
    <br>You have to struggle - "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus."
    <br>You have to struggle to believe, and there is nothing like that.
    <br>It happens naturally; you have to struggle to believe.
    <br>We don't need to struggle to believe.
    <br>This is the way with all kinds of faith.
    <br>It is when you have problems that you fast, you run helter skelter to the church,
    <br>I mean, many of us were supposed to be here a long time ago.
    <br>Because the problems are getting too much, we run down to the church.
    <br>When the trouble has not become too much for you, you consult your elders,
    <br>'pharisees and sadducees' for advice - where to go.
    <br>But when you now have so many problems and you know these problems may likely take your life,
    <br>you don't need to consult them, you go on your own.
    <br>This is the way with all kinds of faith.
    <br>Anything that comes by force is not faith.
    <br>Faith is something that comes spontaneously - that is, naturally. That is faith.
    <br>Who will open the door for the belief that you have?
    <br>The belief is inside the box, being locked.
    <br>Faith locked the belief and put the key inside the pocket.
    <br>For the belief to come out, faith needs to bring out the key and open the door.
    <br>You have the belief but no faith; so, your belief is dormant, inside the box, inactive.
    <br>Christianity is not mere talk; we should put it to practice.
    <br>It's a thing of the heart - Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We need to talk to our heart. This is a question of the heart: Whom do you trust?
    <br>If I ask you, you will say, you trust Jesus.
    <br>Will you allow your heart to talk, instead of you to talk?
    <br>If I ask, "Whom do you trust?", you will say, "Jesus" which is quite different from what your heart trusts.
    <br>This is a question of the heart, tell your neighbor.
    <br>Christianity is a question of the heart.
    <br>When you are asked, "Who are you?", you say, "I am a Christian".
    <br>Anybody can confess this and profess what is not in the heart.
    <br>It is a question of the heart: Will you allow your heart to talk? Because faith is of man's heart.
    <br>Whom do you trust? Because faith is a trust.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "Faith is a trust".
    <br>For you to struggle to believe is wrong.
    <br>There is nothing like that, that struggle has ended over there.
    <br>You know the state where Peter's struggles ended.
    <br>When Peter saw Jesus on the sea, he said, "I want to come with you".
    <br>He started by putting his leg inside the water and was going inside the sea to meet Jesus.
    <br>As he was going, he was sinking - that is struggle.
    <br>He was sinking until the water level was here.
    <br>And Jesus said, "Come!"
    <br>He was still sinking and Jesus allowed him to struggle until the water level was here.
    <br>When the water level was above him and Jesus was only seeing his hands and fingers,
    <br>Jesus said, "Yes, I can see your genuine willingness. Come up!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I know you need to struggle before Jesus notices you, and that struggle must be genuine.
    <br>You must struggle, your struggle will not impair you but improve you.
    <br>So this is just the case.
    <br>Like I have said, what you are seeing is present darkness
    <br>and the moment you give all and surrender to Jesus, you will begin to see the light.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>You just have to see beyond this present darkness.
    <br>Listen to the voice of God: Someone is just changing your history.
    <br>Let your story change!
    <br>Story of your health - change!
    <br>Story of your career - change!
    <br>Story of your business - change!
    <br>Story of your finances - change!
    <br>Story of your marriage - change!
    <br>Let your story change, in Jesus' name!
    <br>When your story changes, you will no longer see the present darkness.
    <br>This is the voice of God: Whatever the story of your health - receive a new dream!
    <br>Breakthrough is a new dream.
    <br>Whatever the story of your career - receive a new dream!
    <br>Prosperity is a new dream.
    <br>It's your new dream - receive a new dream!
    <br>Whatever the story, I don't want to know - up and down story.
    <br>You know where you are supposed to be, going by your effort.
    <br>You know where you are supposed to be, going by your struggles.
    <br>You know where you are supposed to be. Let your story change!
    <br>Going by your effort and struggles, you know where you are supposed to be and where you belong.
    <br>You know.
    <br>Day and night effort to make it happen - it is the will of God to change your story!
    <br>Each time you sit down on your own, you keep asking yourself,
    <br>"How long shall we continue like this?"
    <br>You have exhausted all your efforts, tactics and strategies.
    <br>You thought when you study, travel to America, Europe, all over the world,
    <br>you thought when you have a good partner,
    <br>you have what you call rest.
    <br>Yet, you are still struggling; at this moment, you don't know what to do next.
    <br>This is why you run to God and say, "God, I have exhausted all my strategies and tactics,
    <br>I have applied every intelligence and effort, I have done this, that; I don't know what to do next".
    <br>Rescue me, Lord!
    <br>Rescue me, Lord, and rewrite my history!
    <br>Rescue me, Lord, and change my story!
    <br>Rescue my marriage, and change the history!
    <br>Rescue my business, and change the history!
    <br>Rescue my career, and change the history!
    <br>Rescue my finances, and change the history, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Until you realise that, "No, I need Someone wiser, smarter, cleverer who is Jesus!"
    <br>There is a wonderful name Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
