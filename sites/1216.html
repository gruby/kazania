  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to command all spirits operating in your life,
    <br>operating in your health, tongue, hand, eyes and life - begin to command them out!
    <br>Right now, command them out!
    <br>All spirits operating in your life - command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, I can see the falling of satan in your life.
    <br>I can see the falling of failure!
    <br>I can see the falling of affliction!
    <br>I can see the falling of setback!
    <br>Career failure - I can see the falling!
    <br>I can see the falling of nightmare!
    <br>Right now, in the name of Jesus, agree with me:
    <br>Whatever satan might have used to connect you to himself - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it failure - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it affliction - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it hatred - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it nightmare - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see chains have fallen.
    <br>Chains of affliction have fallen!
    <br>Chains of sickness have fallen!
    <br>Chains of failure have fallen!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Give thanks to God!
