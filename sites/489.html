    <br>Open your lips, and ask for the mercy of God for yourself.
    <br>You need the mercy of God to speak for you.
    <br>His mercy is enough.
    <br>His favour.
    <br>Mercy, mercy, mercy.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Viewers at home, ask for the mercy of God, the favour of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In Jesus Chist's name we pray.
    <br>When you take note of people
    <br>before you in your family,
    <br>you will notice that they had been aspiring for certain positions.
    <br>But they could not get it.
    <br>This shows that there is a limitation in the family.
    <br>Not only you, but people before you.
    <br>It has been their desire to get to certain positions;
    <br>it has been very difficult.
    <br>No way because there is a limitation in the family that needs to be broken.
    <br>As for me, each time I sit down, I say, "Wow!"
    <br>What a grace God has given to me to break this limitation.
    <br>You - you need to break your own.
    <br>I smile; I say I have broken this limitation.
    <br>The cycle of limitation.
    <br>We are not only talking of position this time;
    <br>we are talking about position and peace.
    <br>Position needs peace; position needs comfort.
    <br>Position minus peace is not position.
    <br>You need peace and comfort.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to break that cycle of life; that limitation in the family - break it!
    <br>I will join you in faith to break that limitation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Cycle of limitation - be broken.
    <br>Right now, begin to release yourself!
    <br>Release your family from that sickness, from disease, from limitation.
    <br>Begin to release your family.
    <br>Release your family.
    <br>I release my family.
    <br>I release myself.
    <br>I release!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes, we are moving forward.
    <br>Many of us, we do not know how to pray.
    <br>When you ask God for bread; immediately you say, "God, give me bread".
    <br>Immediately say, "Thank You for giving me bread".
    <br>Then you come back again - "Give me bread, give me bread.
    <br>Thank You for giving me bread.
    <br>Give me bread...give me bread...give me bread.
    <br>Thank You for giving me bread" - that is how to pray.
    <br>These two things must go together: ask and "Thank You".
    <br>But you will not say, "Thank You", because you want to receive before you say thank you.
    <br>This has been robbing you of your blessings.
    <br>"Heal me, Lord. Heal me, Lord. Thank You for healing me."
    <br>"Deliver me, Lord. Deliver me, Lord.
    <br>Thank You for delivering me."
    <br>That is how to pray.
    <br>Thanks must follow your request.
    <br>Pari passu.
    <br>Synonymous.
    <br>Not: "Heal me...heal me...heal me".
    <br>You won't say thank you until the pain disappears.
    <br>He is the Healer.
    <br>He can heal you.
    <br>Even if He has not healed you, He can heal you.
    <br>He is what He says He is.
    <br>He is the Healer, even if He doesn't heal you.
    <br>He is the Deliverer, even if He doesn't delivered you.
    <br>You have to give thanks to Him for those He has delivered,
    <br>and He has delivered you before - give thanks to Him.
    <br>Even if He has not delivered you now, give thanks to Him for delivering some people now.
    <br>Look at the sister that just shared her testimony, thanks must go along with your prayer.
    <br>Are you ready with me?
    <br>You want to release yourself and your community from this yoke.
    <br>Now we are here today to get it done,
    <br>and to release your family from the cage.
    <br>Now open your lips, and begin to release yourself and your family from the cage.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Cycle of limitation.
    <br>Certain position.
    <br>You deserve excellence.
    <br>Yes! Where is excellence in your health?
    <br>Where is excellence in time of peace?
    <br>Where is excellence in time of comfort?
    <br>Where is excellence in term of position?
    <br>There is limitation that needs to be broken by God's intervention through you.
    <br>Right now open you lips.
    <br>Begin to release yourself and your community from that sickness and disease,
    <br>from that cycle of limitation,
    <br>that limitation in progress.
