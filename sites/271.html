  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Forgiveness comes because there is no perfect relationship.
    <br>There must be forgiveness because there is no perfect relationship.
    <br>Let's quickly go to the Book of Romans 15:1,
    <br>"We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.
    <br>Each of us should please his neighbour for his good, to build him up.
    <br>For even Christ did not please Himself but, as it is written:
    <br>'The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me'.
    <br>For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us,
    <br>so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope".
    <br>There must be forgiveness because there is no perfect relationship.
    <br>Relationship means cooperation where people involved benefit or gain.
    <br>If one is weak in one area, he might be strong in another area.
    <br>This means, we have our strengths and our weaknesses.
    <br>We must recognise this in each other.
    <br>You, husband and wife, you must recognise the weakness and strength
    <br>for your relationship to endure,
    <br>for your relationship to last, survive.
    <br>Where I am weak is where you are strong.
    <br>This is the secret of my humility.
    <br>People say, "This man is too humble".
    <br>Why not to be humble, when I understand what life is all about?
    <br>Where I am weak is where you are strong.
    <br>That is the secret of my humility.
    <br>I know you deserve my respect
    <br>and I also deserve your respect.
    <br>You deserve my honour.
    <br>"Man of God - Good Morning" - if I first see you, I should be able to say, "Good Morning, sir" - not me...
    <br>Every time, "Good Morning, Man of God" - Man of God will not ever say, "Good Morning, sir";
    <br>every time, you are the first to call me "Good Morning, sir" - no!
    <br>If I am going and I am the first to see you, "Uncle, Good Morning, sir",
    <br>"Oh, Man of God - Good Morning!"
    <br>That is what life is all about.
    <br>Because I'm a man of God, I am the first to see you, I'm looking at you and I will not...
    <br>"I want to see whether he will not greet me. He doesn't know I'm a man of God."
    <br>NO PERFECT RELATIONSHIP: TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Where I am weak is where you are strong.
    <br>This is the secret of my humility.
    <br>I know you deserve my respect, honour
    <br>and I too, deserve your respect and honour.
    <br>It is not one-sided.
    <br>That is what relationship is all about.
    <br>If you reject one because of his weakness, you also reject his strength.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If you reject one because of his weakness, you also reject his strength.
    <br>I have a funny story that happened 2 weeks ago.
    <br>A woman was saying, "This is a man I would have married, but because of his weakness then..."
    <br>I asked myself, "Why regretting now?"
    <br>The man she has married now is working as a security guy in the company of the man
    <br>she had rejected on account of weakness.
    <br>One wonderful day she went to the husband's working place
    <br>because she could not see her husband early, the husband was coming home very late.
    <br>She tried to meet the husband at the working place.
    <br>On getting there she saw a sign board - so and so name.
    <br>She saw the picture.
    <br>On getting to the security post, she sat down and looked at the catalogue; she started crying.
    <br>She could not mention this to her husband.
    <br>I couldn't answer the nature of weakness but weakness is weakness.
    <br>"This is a man I would have married then but because of his weakness..."
    <br>Today, the man has become a successful person with a happy family.
    <br>If you know your friend's weakness, help him instead of rejecting him
    <br>because a person who is a thorn in your flesh today may be a helper tomorrow.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>A person who is a thorn, who is trouble - giving you pain today
    <br>may be your helper tomorrow.
    <br>Don't reject anyone on account of today.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't reject anyone on account of today because tomorrow is a mystery."
    <br>You know what mystery is?
    <br>When you open your dictionary, you may find different meanings.
    <br>Mystery simply means unknowable, secret.
    <br>This miracle, signs and wonders, divine truth, divine revelation - all these are mysteries.
    <br>Don't reject anyone on account of today because tomorrow is a mystery.
    <br>Mystery - what you don't know what will happen:
    <br>a murderer can become a deliverer, a president, a secretary general tomorrow,
    <br>Don't reject anyone on account of today because tomorrow is a mystery.
    <br>Many have rejected their prospective helpers
    <br>because of inability to see beyond their situation at hand.
    <br>Prospective helper - that is future helper because of differences.
    <br>"No, you lied against me; my friend, you can't do this to me."
    <br>Because of that you say, forever and ever you don't want to hear or see him.
    <br>The person in question may be a deliverer or your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>If you have abandoned him because of those differences, how would you go back?
    <br>Don't allow weakness and confrontation to tear you down or pull you apart.
    <br>Rather, see it as a means of coming closer together
    <br>and being prepared together.
    <br>If two strong people meet, there is no lesson to learn.
    <br>That is not relationship.
    <br>If I am strong and you are strong and we come together,
    <br>that is not relationship.
    <br>One must be weak, one must be strong.
    <br>When I am weak, you are strong. When you are weak, I am strong.
    <br>You are because I am; I am because you are.
    <br>NO PERFECT RELATIONSHIP: TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>No perfect relationship.
    <br>The mouth needs words.
    <br>Feet need to go places.
    <br>Eyes need a view.
    <br>Feet need to go places.
    <br>If you stand for a while on the spot, you will soon die.
    <br>The purpose of feet is to go places.
    <br>Don't reject anyone on account of today.
    <br>God can use broken things for a seat of power,
    <br>for throne, for authority, for a leader of tomorrow.
    <br>NO PERFECT RELATIONSHIP: TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>God often uses foolish things to express Himself.
    <br>I know our lives have been affected greatly because of this.
    <br>NO PERFECT RELATIONSHIP: TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>You have good; you are not pleased and you are looking for better.
    <br>You have better; you are not pleased and you are looking for best.
    <br>In the process of looking for best, you lose better and good.
    <br>NO PERFECT RELATIONSHIP: TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>You have good, you are looking for better behaviours.
    <br>In the process of looking for better behaviours,
    <br>you have forgotten that you too are not an island.
    <br>Where you are strong, the person in question is weak.
    <br>Where you are weak, the person in question is strong.
    <br>Take care of your relationships.
    <br>Relationship means cooperation
    <br>where people involved in that relationship benefit or gain.
    <br>Look at the whole world today; nation to nation.
    <br>There is no small country that does not have strength and weakness.
    <br>NO PERFECT RELATIONSHIP: TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Each country should know that this country is there because that country is there.
    <br>This country is there because that country is there.
    <br>God decided to arrange things like that so that you would not overthrow Him.
    <br>NO PERFECT RELATIONSHIP: TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>If you know how to run, you may not know how to jump.
    <br>If you know how to jump, you may not know how to run,
    <br>so that you would continue to depend on one another for assistance and help.
    <br>NO PERFECT RELATIONSHIP: TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>I can't come to the church and begin to address empty seats.
    <br>You are on the seat, that is why I am standing, talking to you.
    <br>I cannot be on the seat and at the same time address you.
    <br>We can't have 2 T.B. Joshuas.
    <br>T.B. Joshua cannot stand talking and at the same time sitting, listening to T.B. Joshua.
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>You are on the seat, that is why I am out, addressing.
    <br>This is my weakness.
    <br>I cannot sit down and at the same time be standing.
    <br>Your own weakness, you cannot sit down and at the same time, address people.
    <br>Where I am strong, you are weak. Where you are strong, I am weak.
    <br>NO PERFECT RELATIONSHIP: TB Joshua Sermon
