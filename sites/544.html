    <br>So, while we are praying, there is a brother somewhere there.
    <br>You are just in front of a woman that put on red.
    <br>You're wearing a shirt that has many flowers.
    <br>I called you out because of your daughter whom you love so much.
    <br>You travelled from your country to one country and someone deceived you to join a secret cult.
    <br>And this secret cult, right from the beginning, they said
    <br>that they would like to take your daughter for sacrifice.
    <br>Then, you had no female daughter.
    <br>That gave you boldness to join the cult.
    <br>Now, you have a daughter whom you love so much.
    <br>Would you want to give this child?
    <br>Please, come, you are there.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>You are a nice man but you were deceived.
    <br>It's very painful; you don't know how to go about it.
    <br>At the beginning, it was a normal thing in your community, in your environment,
    <br>in your society there that they would go to spiritualists.
    <br>But you too joined them.
    <br>You travelled from your country to a neighbouring country.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>When you got there, you told them that you needed blessing, that your business was not moving,
    <br>you were very poor and owed debt.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>And they said, "No problem."
    <br>From there, you began to enter and enter.
    <br>- You went there three times.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Before they finally told you that they would make you rich...
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>... but they would need your female child.
    <br>It is true, sir.
    <br>- Then, you didn't have a female child.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>You said, "Female child, I don't have a female child."
    <br>It was later that you gave birth to a female child.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>And you love this child so much.
    <br>Very much, sir.
    <br>But they said that they wanted to take this female child.
    <br>It is true, sir.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>He is free.
    <br>I will personally make you to travel back to your country.
    <br>I will pay for your ticket; you will go and bring your daughter here.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>Stand up; come here.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>They have deposited many things in his body.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>He is free now and the Holy Ghost has set a fire around the daughter.
    <br>I know that everybody is afraid.
    <br>This world.
    <br>Not that they would grab the child like this.
    <br>She would just sleep; she would not wake up.
    <br>Or it could be just like that.
    <br>He has a picture of the child.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The daughter is here and he himself is here.
    <br>What a beautiful daughter.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Alfred Mahlangu.
    <br>I come from Nelspruit, South Africa.
    <br>By profession I'm a legal consultant.
    <br>When I came here for the New Year Service on the 2nd of January,
    <br>I received a prophecy through the man of God.
    <br>In the prophecy, he said that there was a brother who was deceived to go with
    <br>a friend to a neighbouring country with the pretence of worshipping there.
    <br>So, while we are praying, there is a brother somewhere there.
    <br>You are just in front of a woman that put on red.
    <br>You're wearing a shirt that has many flowers.
    <br>I called you out because of your daughter whom you love so much.
    <br>You travelled from your country to one country and someone deceived you to join a secret cult.
    <br>And this secret cult, right from the beginning, they said
    <br>that they would like to take your daughter for sacrifice.
    <br>Then, you had no female daughter.
    <br>That gave you boldness to join the cult.
    <br>Now, you have a daughter whom you love so much.
    <br>Would you want to give this child?
    <br>Please, come, you are there.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>The prophecy indeed was true in my life.
    <br>I went to Mozambique with a friend of mine.
    <br>When we went there, unknowingly, I was initiated.
    <br>They also asked me in 1998 to bring my daughter as a sacrifice.
    <br>At that time, I didn't have a daughter but only boys
    <br>so to me, it was not a big deal.
    <br>In 2006, God blessed me with this beautiful girl and immediately after that,
    <br>she got sick and we never knew what the problem was.
    <br>Through prayer, God said I should give her the name, "The protected one" but I never understood why.
    <br>She went in and out of hospital until she got better.
    <br>So, when I came to The SCOAN, the man of God called me
    <br>and I came forward and I was delivered.
    <br>I found out that when I went back to South Africa that my daughter had a dream
    <br>that night of a huge man who came to attack her and wanted to open her skull.
    <br>This confirms the prophecy of the man of God that said that my daughter would die in her sleep.
    <br>But my daughter screamed at the time that I was receiving my deliverance here.
    <br>And I believe that when he said that the baby was protected by fire,
    <br>that was the time the huge man ran away from my child.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>My daughter has never been sick again and I was also delivered.
    <br>I am a legal consultant and my business had stopped functioning.
    <br>I specialised in labour matters but nobody came to consult me.
    <br>But since I came to The SCOAN, God has opened a lot of doors for me.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>Bring your daughter here.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>Come.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>Come here.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>Carry your daughter and stand there.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>That is all.
    <br>This is what you need today; tell your neighbour, "This is what I need today."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is what I need today."
    <br>That is all.
    <br>HEARTBREAKING: Innocent Girl Used For RITUAL SACRIFICE...
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Blessed be Your name, Lord.
    <br>Waive your hand.
    <br>Father, thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
