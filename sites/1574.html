    <br>ASK TB JOSHUA: Do MIRACLES Still Happen Today? ðŸ¤”
    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>QUESTION:
    <br>A well-known minister of God recently renounced Christianity because he said
    <br>there were no more miracles happening.
    <br>Man of God, what can you say about this?
    <br>ANSWER:
    <br>If the age of miracles is passed, no one could be born-again.
    <br>Anyone who claims that the age of miracles has passed is not yet born-again -
    <br>I mean, he is not a Christian, believer, pastor, evangelist.
    <br>Indeed, the greatest miracle is to be born-again!
    <br>For you to be born-again, you have to be a product of miracles.
    <br>You cannot say there are no miracles when you are a product of miracles!
    <br>Is it a miracle of healing for an affliction that you are referring to?
    <br>Believe me, that is a lesser miracle!
    <br>I repeat: The greatest miracle is to be born-again.
    <br>You cannot deny miracles since you are a product of miracles -
    <br>if truly you are born-again.
    <br>If unbelievers say this, we can understand - because they can also say Jesus is not the Lord.
    <br>Are we referring to unbelievers or believers?
    <br>If you are not a Christian, there is no way you can understand the depth,
    <br>the insight of the nature of God.
    <br>You may see, hear and learn but not practise.
    <br>You can master and quote the chapters and verses of the Bible for many years,
    <br>hear thousands of sermons and read many Christian books but still wear spiritual diapers.
    <br>For God to hear and answer prayer - whether the petition is for a postage stamp,
    <br>or for you to sleep and wake up or for the healing of someone crippled - it is a miracle.
    <br>If your prayer brings an answer, that answer is a miracle!
    <br>If there are no miracles, then there is no reason for faith.
    <br>God cannot answer prayer without miracle.
