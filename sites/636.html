    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Yuriy and I am from Ukraine.
    <br>The SCOAN is really a church of all nations. Let's praise the Lord for this.
    <br>Yuriy - Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>I want to tell you how Emmanuel TV really changed my life.
    <br>About two years ago, my wife and I started watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>and it greatly affected our marital life, relationships and my spiritual life.
    <br>When I watch Emmanuel TV, I receive a message,
    <br>some kind of revelation for myself each day.
    <br>Tell us, brother: How did you actually discover Emmanuel TV, all the way in Ukraine?
    <br>I was browsing on YouTube and found some interesting videos
    <br>about deliverances and prophecies by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I really got interested because I had never seen such deliverances and miracles before.
    <br>I got interested in what Prophet T.B. Joshua was doing.
    <br>About six months ago, an incident happened in our family.
    <br>You see my wife here.
    <br>One day, she was at home with our baby boy.
    <br>She just bent down to pick him up and something snapped in her back.
    <br>When I came into the house, I saw her lying on the floor and the baby was crying.
    <br>I tried to pick her up but it took me almost ten minutes to pick her up.
    <br>The pain was so intense that I had to lay her down on her side
    <br>and she laid there for nearly two days.
    <br>I had to roll her to move her because she couldn't move on her own.
    <br>We called the doctor and the doctor came and did some kind of massage
    <br>but nothing good happened; she rather got worse.
    <br>At that point, she was basically completely crippled. She couldn't walk, she couldn't move.
    <br>Absolutely. She couldn't move or walk.
    <br>In the evening of the second day, I decided to go to YouTube
    <br>to find videos of healing prayer for viewers with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Here, you can see in the picture how we were just touching the screen.
    <br>As you know, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>God filled my heart with belief that I could touch the screen
    <br>and then, touch my wife and God would touch her and heal her.
    <br>We prayed for about one minute and at one point,
    <br>I felt something moving inside of us.
    <br>I saw that my wife just stood up and started to bend down and to the left and right.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sir, as you prayed with Prophet T.B. Joshua on YouTube,
    <br>a prayer he had prayed for viewers around the world,
    <br>the power of God descended in your house in Ukraine, and your wife received her healing.
    <br>Yes, she received her healing and started moving and checking herself.
    <br>I even asked her what she was doing because she couldn't move before.
    <br>She went and dressed up on her own, without my help
    <br>and we went to testify to our parents for what God had done in our lives.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Ever since then, sir, how is your wife since that prayer
    <br>she offered with Prophet T.B. Joshua? What is her condition since then?
    <br>She feels absolutely wonderful. She is in Ukraine with our two sons.
    <br>God is blessing us very much. Praise the Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah. We can see the pictures here.
    <br>Can you just show us again. Who is this lady?
    <br>Her name is Julia.
    <br>Wow, we can see her testifying here after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>how she received her healing instantly in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Brother, what can you tell the world about Emmanuel TV
    <br>and especially how you encourage people to pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>on Emmanuel TV, anywhere they are in the world.
    <br>I'd like to say to the whole world that Emmanuel TV is really a gift of today.
    <br>You may not be able to come every day to The SCOAN
    <br>because you may live very far from here but distance is not a barrier.
    <br>You can watch Emmanuel TV and God will raise your spiritual life up.
    <br>If there is any trouble or affliction in your life or any problem of any kind,
    <br>you can pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua and God will move in your life.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Once again, this is a great encouragement for those who are living a very far distance
    <br>from the church here in Lagos, Nigeria. You may physically not be able to come
    <br>but by faith, join with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV
    <br>and the same power of God working here will touch you anywhere you are all over the world.
    <br>Even if you can't access Emmanuel TV on satellite,
    <br>on the internet Emmanuel TV is streaming 24/7
    <br>and there are also many wonderful clips on our official YouTube channel
    <br>which you can connect by faith with and God will touch you as well.
    <br>Brother, we thank God for your life, and we know the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
