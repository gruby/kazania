  <p>    
    <br>Welcome to the prayer line section of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>where Prophet T.B. Joshua is ministering prayer to the people in Jesus' name.
    <br>He ministers prayer to this man, and the man swings out of the prayer line.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua stretches forth his hand in Jesus' name, and the man drops to the ground.
    <br>This is the power and anointing of our Lord Jesus Christ throwing the man's back straight on the floor.
    <br>Wait a minute.
    <br>The man slowly rises back up,
    <br>and has an intense stare in his eyes.
    <br>This is round two.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua moves to the right with a kick, and down he goes.
    <br>Down on the ground and down for the count.
    <br>He did not know what hit him.
    <br>This is Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Do you want to fight me?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Do you want to fight me?
    <br>Who sent you to destroy me?
    <br>Who?
    <br>Who sent you to destroy me?
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>At the name of Jesus Christ, every spirit must bow.
    <br>Rise up, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The man rises to his feet and the spiritual battle continues.
    <br>Your back on the floor!
    <br>After the prayer his back is flat on the floor, and then he slithers back up.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>You are destroying me!
    <br>I'm destroying you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I'm the lion.
    <br>The lion?
    <br>You want to touch me? OK, touch me if you can touch.
    <br>Just touch and see.
    <br>The man possessing the spirit of a lion arches his fingers like claws,
    <br>and moves forward in an attempt to touch the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He gets into position and moves closer to grab the man's of God leg.
    <br>But look at his hand!
    <br>It begins to shake.
    <br>Satan's power is powerless in the face of God's armour and weapons.
    <br>And down he goes.
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>Watch!
    <br>Stop that! In the name of Jesus, stop it!
    <br>Many of you are toys in their hands.
    <br>They can only run from light.
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>This is a test of faith.
    <br>You can just come and stand in front of him and see whether he will not grab you.
    <br>Come and stand in front of him.
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>Come.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>Don’t touch me, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Get away from me, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Don’t touch me in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Leave the place.
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>If everyone should meet him, you would be able to know your level,
    <br>whom you are in Christ Jesus.
    <br>So, do we have a pastor here?
    <br>If you are a pastor, please come forward – this is Christianity in practice.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>This is a practical side of Christianity.
    <br>OK
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>Give him a mic.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>This is a very practical Christianity.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, out!
    <br>Stop that, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>Praying is not saying words.
    <br>The power comes in the praying not in saying the words.
    <br>Even if everybody here comes together and makes a force,
    <br>if that force is in the natural, he will still grab you all together.
    <br>He is on the other side.
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I declare you free!
    <br>Contrary spirit, out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Jesus Christ has delivered him, and the spiritual battle is over.
    <br>The man looks around strangely as he realizes that the demonic nature and power within,
    <br>have been defeated by the mighty power of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Emotions begin to flow as Jesus Christ has put an end to his past,
    <br>and he is now a new creation in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>See him crying.
    <br>The demon used his body as a temple.
    <br>Why are you crying?
    <br>I don’t know where I am.
    <br>I thank God for saving me.
    <br>Who is Jesus?
    <br>He is my Deliverer.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Here he comes.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel! God is with us. (Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chinedu Nwosu. I come from Abia State, Nigeria.
    <br>This is my mum.
    <br>I thank God for what He has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in my life,
    <br>for delivering me from the world of darkness we had gone into.
    <br>I was possessed with a demon.
    <br>I was a dragon in my world then.
    <br>Now, I've been delivered by Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>into this real world which God has placed me in.
    <br>And the powers I had then were so many.
    <br>I used those powers to sleep with people.
    <br>I would dream. Sometimes, the person would feel that their husband
    <br>was having fun with them but he was not.
    <br>I'd make the husband be like wood lying in the bed while I had fun with them.
    <br>Those are spiritual husbands.
    <br>Spiritual husbands come in two ways.
    <br>One comes from the marine world where I came from and one comes physically.
    <br>Then their husband would be nothing to them anymore.
    <br>But I thank God that Prophet T.B. Joshua has delivered me from this world of darkness.
    <br>I used the power of lion to put fear in people; they couldn't look at my face.
    <br>If they were about 15 to 30 trying to bring me down, I'd bring all of them down because they were nothing.
    <br>All of them would be like dead rats in my sight.
    <br>I would make sure I pulled every power they had down.
    <br>If care was not taken, sorry would be their name.
    <br>I would bring them down because the power in me didn’t come from me alone
    <br>but from the world of darkness.
    <br>If you feel that the world of darkness is not real, the devil is not real - the devil exists.
    <br>There is not any other power more than the blood of Jesus Christ.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, I was at the prayer line and Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me.
    <br>When he touched me, it was just like burning fire.
    <br>When he came a second time, I couldn't withstand him.
    <br>The spirit in me couldn't withstand it.
    <br>He asked me if I wanted to fight him and I was bold enough to tell him that I wanted to fight him.
    <br>Do you want to fight me?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Who sent you to destroy me?
    <br>Who?
    <br>Who sent you to destroy me?
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Assuming I pulled him down,
    <br>that would have been the glory to the kingdom world.
    <br>But he beat me to the end.
    <br>He made sure that he proved that the blood of Jesus Christ saves.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I declare you free!
    <br>Contrary spirit, out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>In the end, I was delivered. I was just like a dead lion.
    <br>Now at this moment, I give thanks to God because I am back to my original self that I was.
    <br>There is something that I saw in the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>There is a great light covering him so I could not hurt him.
    <br>The Lord, God Almighty has used Prophet T.B Joshua to deliver me.
    <br>I'm free and I'm free forever.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank God for saving my son.
    <br>My name is Mrs Mercy Nwosu. I am the mother of Chinedu.
    <br>My testimony goes like this. Chinedu is my son.
    <br>When I gave birth to him, he was a good child.
    <br>During his school age years, he was good
    <br>but a time came when he started changing from what I used to know him as.
    <br>His behaviour turned to something else; nobody was able to look at him.
    <br>If he was aggressive, 10 to 15 men could not withhold him.
    <br>Even in the school, they called him by the name, 'Ninja'.
    <br>I went and reported to the principal and the teachers that they should warn
    <br>these children not to be calling my son Ninja because he was behaving abnormally.
    <br>Many times, I used to see him act funny and do funny things.
    <br>He behaved harshly like a lion as he has confessed.
    <br>Everyone in the home used to fear him because of his aggressiveness.
    <br>The evil spirit used to come and go. We went to many places for his deliverance.
    <br>Many prayer homes, herbalists and many other places but to no avail.
    <br>I thank God. Last Sunday, we watched Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>live on Emmanuel TV, how God used him to save my son.
    <br>Many people even friends and neighbours were around watching live.
    <br>Many people gave their lives to Christ on Sunday.
