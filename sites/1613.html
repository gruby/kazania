  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, if you are not in covenant with God,
    <br>I mean, if you are not in right standing with God, why should He answer your prayer?
    <br>That is the question you need to answer:
    <br>Why should God answer your prayer when you are not in right standing,
    <br>when you are not in covenant with Him?
    <br>That is why we are here today.
    <br>Covenant-giving God.
    <br>Covenant-keeping God
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Alpha and Omega
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Covenant-keeping God
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>Alpha and Omega
    <br>There is no one like You
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now, say after me:
    <br>Lord, have mercy on me.
    <br>Forgive me of my sins.
    <br>Wash me and cleanse me of my sins.
    <br>If you mean it with all your heart, God will respond.
    <br>Mean it!
    <br>If you mean it with all your heart, the Lord will respond.
    <br>Have mercy on me.
    <br>Let Your mercy speak for me today.
    <br>Let Your favour...
    <br>Mean it!
    <br>This can be a soul-saving, life-changing prayer.
    <br>Mean it!
    <br>The Blood of Jesus
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>The Blood of Jesus
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>The Blood of Jesus
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>When we are washed with the Blood of Jesus, we are risen with Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Oh the Blood
    <br>Oh the Blood of Jesus
    <br>Oh the Blood of Jesus
    <br>It washes white as snow
    <br>Oh the Blood of Jesus
    <br>Oh the Blood of Jesus
    <br>It washes white as snow
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>If you must know a prosperous, happy and successful life, you must learn to plant.
    <br>Plant your love, your mercy, your kindness, your forgiveness, your money, your quality time -
    <br>if you want to know a prosperous, happy and successful life.
    <br>Quality time and every good thing the Lord has given you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is a wonderful name
    <br>Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
    <br>Listen once again.
    <br>If you must know a prosperous, happy and successful life, you must learn to plant -
    <br>plant your love, your mercy, your kindness, your strength, your quality time,
    <br>your faith, your money and every good thing the Lord has given you.
    <br>We want to know a prosperous, happy and successful life; that is why we are here today.
    <br>Be ready to plant your love.
    <br>Be ready to plant your kindness, your mercy.
    <br>Be ready to plant your quality time, not time you do not need.
    <br>Be ready to plant your money and every good thing God has given you.
    <br>I want to assure you - you will leave here with abundant blessing.
    <br>Say, I will leave here with abundant blessing and I will be ready to plant my love,
    <br>my kindness, my favour, my mercy, my money, my quality time, my strength, my faith
    <br>and every good thing the Lord has given me.
    <br>That is your promise.
    <br>Without planting, you cannot maintain your abundant life.
    <br>You cannot; there is no way you can maintain your blessing without planting
    <br>your love, money, quality time.
    <br>Be ready to plant your forgiveness.
    <br>I want to assure you - you are leaving here with abundant life, abundant blessing.
    <br>Be ready to plant in order to maintain this blessing.
    <br>There is no way you can maintain this blessing you are about to receive without planting -
    <br>love and be loved, help and be helped.
    <br>We are saved to save others.
    <br>Right now, begin to think of how you will plant; where you need to go when you leave here and help.
    <br>Don't wait until that is on the table.
    <br>Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised."
    <br>Don't wait until that is on the table.
    <br>There are many others out there who need your help.
    <br>You are going to be blessed abundantly today.
    <br>Believe that; let me see your heart.
    <br>Lord, open my heart to Your Spirit.
    <br>When your heart is not open to the Spirit, you will not understand what I'm saying.
    <br>I'm seeing your table full of essentials of life.
    <br>He will prepare a table before me in the presence of who?
    <br>[My enemies.]
    <br>Who is your enemy?
    <br>Those who you have not helped.
    <br>Those whom you refuse to help are your enemies.
    <br>When you say that someone is not greeting you and you greet that person,
    <br>he is no longer your enemy.
    <br>You are planting your love.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>I will not be able to move forward until your heart is ready to do this - plant;
    <br>ready to plant your love, strength, quality time.
    <br>The time you are giving to your neighbour is not a quality time.
    <br>Look at the time you are here today.
    <br>Because you don't have so much to do out there;
    <br>there is no business, bank is not open, no business - nothing;
    <br>that is why you are here today praying.
    <br>And I'm very sure if there was a big business out there, you would likely not be here.
    <br>Quality time.
    <br>Quality strength.
    <br>You are looking for quality things from God; you should also be ready to plant quality things.
    <br>What are you looking for?
    <br>Quality what?
    <br>Quality time.
    <br>Quality life.
    <br>This is what you are looking for from God.
    <br>You should be ready to plant quality things, not time you do not need,
    <br>not a car you do not need.
    <br>In your garage you just say, "Come on, carry this car".
    <br>These are the cars you don't use any longer.
    <br>Open my heart to Your Spirit.
    <br>- In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>- [Amen!]
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>God is reliable.
    <br>If you agree with me, let me see your hand.
    <br>He is reliable?
    <br>If He is reliable, trust in Him.
    <br>Your breakthrough - trust in Him.
    <br>He is reliable.
    <br>Right now, stretch your hand forward.

    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>See people still vomiting out poisonous substances in different parts of the church.
    <br>All that satan has planted in them and what they have eaten from the table of the enemy,
