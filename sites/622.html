    <br>Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua's teacher, who taught him Primary 1, 2, 3 and 4.
    <br>We are joined today by Mrs. Margaret Tolani Adejumo, who was one of the first teachers of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>back in his elementary educational days.
    <br>It is a great privilege to have her with us today.
    <br>First of all madam, could you introduce yourself to our viewers?
    <br>I am Mrs. Margaret Tolani Adejumo. I am a teacher by occupation.
    <br>I taught Prophet T.B. Joshua when he was in primary school.
    <br>When was this time? What year was this?
    <br>That was around 1974.
    <br>We would like to ask you what you remember about Prophet T.B. Joshua when he was in school?
    <br>What were the character or behavioural traits you remember seeing in him at that young age?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was a jovial pupil when I was teaching him.
    <br>He was not the class captain, but he acted as the class captain.
    <br>During the Scripture period, that is B.K. - which we call Bible Studies - he acted like a prophet.
    <br>When we finished talking about any topic in the Bible, he would further explain to the students what he understood
    <br>about the lesson I had taught them in Bible Knowledge (B.K.).
    <br>During that period, we called him 'small pastor' because he acted well.
    <br>People would say 'small pastor' because he was of small stature among his mates, but very active.
    <br>That was why people called him 'small pastor'.
    <br>He was very active, and he led them throughout the period he was in that class.
    <br>You have talked about him educationally, particularly in religious knowledge that he was very active in that subject.
    <br>Was he good in other subjects as well?
    <br>He was good in other subjects, but particularly in Bible Knowledge.
    <br>He was very bold and didn't tire of talking. If you asked him to explain something, he would explain it.
    <br>Whenever any of the pupils were causing problems, he would go and talk to them and try to make peace.
    <br>He would talk to them - "This is not good."
    <br>Every time he did this, he tried to talk to them from the Bible.
    <br>One day, when a mad man came to our school (he slept in the school compound), they saw him with a cutlass.
    <br>When the pupils came into the school, they were afraid of that man and no one could drive him away.
    <br>Even the teachers were trying to keep away from that mad man, telling the students to stay away from the man.
    <br>But T.B. Joshua went to him and people were crying, "No, don't go!"
    <br>But he said, "What? I will go to him."
    <br>So, he went to him and said, "Bring that cutlass" - he was commanding the man.
    <br>The mad man just gave the cutlass to him!
    <br>He then told the man to go, "Don't stay here", and he went away.
    <br>Did the man ever come back to the school to disturb you?
    <br>He didn't come back again.
    <br>- He never came back again?
    <br>- No.
    <br>This is an amazing story, and it reminds me of one of the teachings, where Prophet T.B. Joshua says that
    <br>David spoke the word of faith and the giant fell.
    <br>So, even at an early age, he was demonstrating the power in the word of faith.
    <br>At this incident, what was the reaction of the other students and the teachers?
    <br>I suspect he must have gained quite a reputation.
    <br>They were embarrassed because he was very small
    <br>and people that were taller than him couldn't come near the man.
    <br>They were afraid, thinking, "How could this small boy have the boldness to take that cutlass from the mad man?"
    <br>All the students and teachers were talking about him, "Only God knows what type of boy is this 'prophet'."
    <br>They were amazed and said, "This must be the Lord's doing".
    <br>Were there any other character traits that he displayed that made him different to the other pupils there?
    <br>During the time he was in the school, he had an interest in playing football.
    <br>If they were going to play anywhere, he would foretell whether his school or another school would win.
    <br>You are saying he would prophesy?
    <br>Yes, that "This school is going to win," or, "My school is going to win," and it would be so.
    <br>So, just as he would foretell or prophesy at that young age,
    <br>the outcome of the game before it happened would be as he said?
    <br>Yes and I knew he was going to be a great man.
    <br>You knew right from that young age that he was going to be great, and indeed today we can see the fruit of that.
    <br>I believe that must give you a lot of joy and happiness to see this man of God now
    <br>and know that you were one of the people who taught him and contributed to his life.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Age 17
    <br>The picture you are looking at is Prophet T.B. Joshua at the age of 17.

    <br>Age 20
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Age 25
    <br>Life is in stages: A time to be born, a time to grow, a time to face persecution, a time to overcome
    <br>and a time to show the proceeds of victory.
    <br>And here, Prophet T.B. Joshua is aged 44.

    <br>Age 45
    <br>This is Prophet T.B. Joshua at 50.
    <br>This is Prophet T.B. Joshua at 52.
    <br>This is Abati Street, the site of his first home in Lagos.
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua left his family home in Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria, he came to live in Lagos.

    <br>Mrs. Lasisi
    <br>(Landlady)
    <br>This is the room Prophet T.B. Joshua stayed in when he lived here.
    <br>The room was too small, so we used it as a store.
    <br>However, when he requested for an apartment, we removed the things we had in the store and rented it to him.
    <br>The landlady shows us the small room where Prophet T.B. Joshua lived when he first came to Lagos.
    <br>We doubted him when he first came to rent this house because
    <br>he was a young man and may not have been able to afford the rental fee.
    <br>So, I am surprised at who he is today - that God could choose him from among all.
    <br>I had a lot of tenants then, but God chose him from among all.
    <br>He loved the little ones and played with them, as well as the elderly ones.
    <br>He was a cheerful giver; he was not a fighter and he settled disputes among people.
    <br>Mr. Abati, Lagos
    <br>Coming out of the house is Mr. Abati, the owner of the street in which Prophet T.B. Joshua lived.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>Mr. Abati, Lagos.
    <br>People called him Tope then, but when I met him, I called him Prophet.
    <br>I got to know about him when people talked about him whenever they passed by.
    <br>He loved little ones, played and ate with them.
    <br>Because he is so humble, the Lord has lifted him up. I thank God for his life.
    <br>Mr. Abati, the owner of the street, said that he was one of the people who used to visit Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for prayer and counselling when he was living in Abati Street.
