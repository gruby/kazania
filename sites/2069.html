  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Good Morning Church.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: BELIEF IN HIS WORD
    <br>Belief in what?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Belief in His Word.
    <br>You begin to believe the Word of God when it dominates your heart.
    <br>No amount of Word of God in your mouth can influence your conduct and character.
    <br>No matter how brilliant you are - you commit It to your memory, without your heart.
    <br>It is when it dominates your heart, you begin to believe.
    <br>You begin to believe when the Word dominates your heart.
    <br>It is when the Word of God dominates your heart, you can go forth and go on
    <br>in the discharge of our Christian duty.
    <br>Yes, when the Word of God dominates your heart,
    <br>you can go forth and go on in the discharge of your Christian duty.
    <br>The words we preach, the words we say in counsel, in prayer, in teaching
    <br>must be according to God's Spirit.
    <br>That is, the more you think more about what you read, the more your heart acts upon the Word.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>That is, the more you think more - not just thinking.
    <br>Because faith prevails over thinking processes.
    <br>But thinking more - the more you think more about what you read in the Bible.
    <br>How do we think more?
    <br>When your passion and all of you is carried along while reading.
    <br>You may be reading and at the same time your mind will be somewhere.
    <br>While you are reading, you keep thinking about your situation
    <br>- that you are sick or business failure or your handset is beside you,
    <br>you are expecting a call from your debtor - and you are reading your Bible.
    <br>Your mind will be telling you, "When will this man call me? When will I receive this call?".
    <br>For you to think more, your passion and all of you must be carried along while reading the Bible.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>All of you must be carried along - that is, you must put your handset off.
    <br>Do you know what it means? When you want to read your Bible you must put your handset off.
    <br>This means that you are done with the things on the outside.
    <br>You want to receive the food for the spirit.
    <br>Do you know what it means? When you are eating food that you enjoy,
    <br>and at the same time while you are eating it you get a call, you may not answer.
    <br>Your passion and all of you will be there.
    <br>In the same vein, for you to think more,
    <br>while reading, your passion and all of you must be carried along.
    <br>Let's go to the book of John 6 from verse 63.
    <br>I will first of all read from verse 1: "After this, Jesus crossed over to the far side of the Sea of Galilee,
    <br>also known as the Sea of Tiberias.
    <br>A huge crowd kept following Him wherever He went.
    <br>because they saw His miraculous signs as He healed ..."
    <br>Take note of that: "They saw his miraculous signs as He healed the sick".
    <br>Let's go to verse 63.
    <br>"The Spirit alone gives eternal life" - Take note of that.
    <br>"The Spirit alone gives eternal life. Human effort accomplishes nothing.
    <br>And the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life".
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>You know, we are talking of the more you think more, the more your spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>If your spirit has not acted upon the Word, the Word will remain on your lips.
    <br>And I told you that there is no amount of Word on your mouth that can change you.
    <br>It is when the Word dominates our heart that it can influence our conduct and our character.
    <br>That is why today you can see many of us preaching the Word powerfully, but we cannot do anything with the Word.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord!" - we preach powerfully, we pray, but we cannot loose or bind.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This means every Word of God is Spirit and life.
    <br>Every Word of God is Spirit and life.
    <br>When we receive and obey the Word of God, the power of God works in us.
    <br>This means, the Word of God becomes the power of God.
    <br>How does the power of God work in us?
    <br>The power of God begins to work in us when we think more about what we read in the Bible.
    <br>And the more we think more about what we read,
    <br>the more our spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>When our spirit acts upon the Word, the Word becomes part of us.
    <br>And when something becomes part of you - you can loose and bind - it becomes an instrument.
    <br>It becomes an instrument when something becomes part of you.
    <br>Like this is part of you [your arm].
    <br>This one is part of me.
    <br>I can [punch]. But if it is not part of me, I can't [punch]. It is not an instrument.
    <br>Take note of that: We are talking of every Word of God is Spirit and life.
    <br>When we receive and obey the Word of God that is Spirit and life, what happens?
    <br>The power of God works in us.
    <br>This means, the Word of God becomes the power of God.
    <br>How do we have this power of God?
    <br>We have the power of God when we think more about what we read in the Bible.
    <br>Not thinking. Because faith prevails over thinking processes.
    <br>When we think more - to think more is to meditate.
    <br>When you are thinking, you cannot think above your situation.
    <br>All you will think about is, "My head, my business, my home, my husband, my wife,
    <br>the setback, the challenges, comparing yourself to others, measuring yourself" - these are the things you think about.
    <br>You think about your age, "Look at my age, my colleagues have made it. See me, I am still there",
    <br>your limited education.
    <br>These are the things you think about.
    <br>You can't think about that; it is not possible.
    <br>But when you think more, you will begin to think, "When this life is over, what happens next?".
    <br>That is, 'think more' started from, "When this life is over, what next?".
    <br>That is, when today is your last day on earth, what next? That is 'think more'.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>People keep asking me, "How do we have faith?".
    <br>In our message every day, you must know God.
    <br>Before you can have a foundation for faith, you must know God.
    <br>Because faith does not originate in us; faith originates with God.
    <br>Faith does not originate in us; it does not originate in saints.
    <br>'Saints' means apostles of the old.
    <br>If faith originates in us, it will become fragile, weak because we have an end and we have a beginning.
    <br>Both we and apostles have an end and we have a beginning - the day you were born and the day you will die.
    <br>Faith will die if faith originates in us.
    <br>You will suddenly die.
    <br>Faith does not originate in us; you cannot find faith in yourself.
    <br>Faith originates with God.
    <br>God has no beginning; He has no end.
    <br>If faith originates with God, how do we get faith?
    <br>You must know God.
    <br>If you know God, you will simultaneously have faith.
    <br>How do we know God?
    <br>We know God by the Word He speaks.
    <br>You may say, "Where is God? I can't see God".
    <br>By the Word He speaks.
    <br>And the Word He speaks represents His heart's desire.
    <br>If you see any ministers of God that say, "Be delivered!" or "Be healed!", it is not God, but a human being like you.
    <br>But the Word he spoke, if there is a before and after, and he speaks it and it happens, then God is that Word.
    <br>When God said, "Let there be light", assume there was no light, He's not God.
    <br>But He said, "Let there be light" and there was light. That made Him God.
    <br>We know God by the Word He speaks.
    <br>The Word He speaks represents His heart's desire.
    <br>So now, how do I have faith?
    <br>I have faith when I know God
    <br>and that faith continues to grow simultaneously
    <br>as I continue to look unto God, look at God, meditate on God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Do you want me to take you back again?
    <br>How do we have faith?
    <br>You have faith when you know God.
    <br>And faith continues to grow as we continue to look unto God, look at God, meditate on God.
    <br>If you know God, you will simultaneously have faith.
    <br>It grows.
    <br>Look at the case of a farmer,
    <br>like we have read in John 6:63.
    <br>When a farmer gets his seed into the ground,
    <br>he does not dig it up every day to see how it is doing.
    <br>We are all farmers; that is where we all came from.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When a farmer gets his seed into the ground, into the soil,
    <br>he does not dig it up every day to see how it is doing.
    <br>He believes it is okay, it is settled.
    <br>If a farmer could have faith in nature - just nature - we Christians must have faith in the imperishable Seed.
    <br>They have faith in nature - just nature - but we must have faith in the God of nature -
    <br>that is, imperishable Seed, the Word of God.
    <br>They have faith without any definite promise.
    <br>There is no assurance.
    <br>They carry their seed, make heaps, dig into the ground and put their seed into the ground.
    <br>And they have faith without any definite promise.
    <br>They believe that, "Oh, tomorrow it will germinate. Next week it will germinate".
    <br>No, it varies depending on the soil.
    <br>And the rain may not fall, and the weather may not be okay with the seed.
    <br>So they have many challenges that could actually frustrate their crops,
    <br>but yet they have faith.
    <br>You will never see a farmer coming every day to dig up and see whether the seed is growing.
    <br>You will never see them, "Let me check my seed to see whether it is growing". You will never.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why do we Christians not have faith in the God of nature?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Why not have faith in the God of nature?"
    <br>Your father has faith in nature.
    <br>Not even your father, but you - that is what brought you up when you were very small -
    <br>nearly 90% of us came from a village.
    <br>I said that 90% of us here were brought up by a farmer
    <br>and you were educated, you were sent to school, a scholarship was given to you by these farmers -
    <br>your upbringing from cattle-rearer, farming.
    <br>But you are suddenly forgetting your roots;
    <br>you were brought up in that way.
    <br>Until now many of us are still in that business.
    <br>So each time you remember that you have faith in nature,
    <br>but now to have faith in the God of nature is a problem.
    <br>Every day you want to dig up to see whether God is at work.
    <br>If I am talking to you ...
    <br>Every day you want to look at your bank account to see whether the money is increasing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Every day when I say, "Be healed!",
    <br>after the healing you look back and say, "I am healed!",
    <br>but tomorrow you go to the doctor for a check-up - to check your blood, to check your kidneys.
    <br>You want to dig up to see whether God is actually working.
    <br>You come with your medical report, "Heal me!".
    <br>"Be healed, in Jesus' name!".
    <br>"Amen".
    <br>I said, "You are healed!".
    <br>"Walk!".
    <br>That is not walking; you are jumping.
    <br>Even you that are fit, you can't jump.
    <br>Suddenly you are healed. "Walk!" and you start jumping.
    <br>There is still an element of doubt that, "If I am healed I should be able to jump, not even walk".
    <br>Every day you dig up to see whether God is at work.
    <br>But your fathers, when they get their seed into the ground, they will never dig up to see how the seed is doing.
    <br>They believe that it is well, it is settled, it is doing well.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Ask God to give you grace not to be ignorant of your faith
    <br>under any pressure of sickness, temptation setback, poverty, hardship.
    <br>Ask God, "Give me the grace not to be ignorant of my faith under the pressures of temptation, sickness, disease".
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Look at what I am saying now - ignorance of your faith under the pressure of sickness.
    <br>You are here. You say, "Jesus, heal me".
    <br>The man of God says, "You are healed, in Jesus' name!".
    <br>Look at what happened to the man at the Beautiful Gate.
    <br>When Peter and John saw the man begging at the Beautiful Gate,
    <br>he was stretching his hand to collect money.
    <br>And Peter said, "Silver and gold have I none. What I have I give you. In the name of Jesus, rise and walk!".
    <br>In the same vein today, "Be healed, in Jesus' name!",
    <br>and what you could not do before you find yourself jumping.
    <br>At the same time you begin to dance to show. You move your leg like that, "Are you sure I am healed?".
    <br>But when you get home, you go to your doctor again.
    <br>"Check me here. Take my blood; check it. Am I still having those traces of blood? Are you sure? Check it again".
    <br>After seeing that doctor, you still go to another doctor.
    <br>You are digging up every day to see whether God is really working the miracle.
    <br>If that is how farmers, after putting their seed in the soil,
    <br>imagine they begin to dig it up to see how the seed is doing,
    <br>what will happen to the seed?
    <br>But after putting the seed into the ground,
    <br>you will never see them going there to dig it up to see how the seed is doing.
    <br>They believe it is alright; it is settled.
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Ask God, "Give me the grace not to be ignorant of my faith
    <br>under pressure and tension of sickness, disease, poverty, hardship".
    <br>Because it is this pressure of sickness, disease that causes this.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>Give me grace not to be ignorant of my faith under pressure and tension of sickness, disease, poverty, hardship.
    <br>Not to be ignorant of your faith under pressure of sickness, disease, poverty.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Not to be ignorant of your faith under pressure of sickness, disease, poverty.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>If I were to pray the same way you pray, my prayer would not be answered ...
    <br>Let me tell you a few words about the prayer.
    <br>When you see me stretching my hand to pray for you, that is not just the beginning -
    <br>I consider where I am coming from before I pray.
    <br>I must have been in an attitude of prayer before I say, "Be healed!".
    <br>If I am not in an attitude of prayer, in the realm of prayer, I cannot say, "Be healed!".
    <br>Who am I going to call when I am not in the realm?
    <br>Jesus is in the realm of prayer; that is why He answers prayer.
    <br>When you are not in that realm of prayer and you are praying, who are you calling, who are you talking to?
    <br>You are talking to yourself.
    <br>You must be in the realm.
    <br>You can't stand here and begin to call somebody in Isolo, somebody in Oshodi.
    <br>You must be in Oshodi to call the person in Oshodi.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You can't stand here and begin to call someone in London without being in London.
    <br>I mean, without any technology, using your mouth.
    <br>You cannot begin to use your handset to call Jesus. No.
    <br>It is not possible. You must get there and call the person.
    <br>It is meditation that takes us to Him.
    <br>And when we get to Him, we pray.
    <br>But you don't meditate and you pray.
    <br>It is meditation that carries us to Jesus.
    <br>Look at the fruit. Can you see the fruit here?
    <br>It is not possible for me here to stretch to take the fruit.
    <br>My arm is not long enough to get there. I can't get any fruit.
    <br>I must get there to get the fruit.
    <br>To get there, it is by meditation. Meditation will take me to the fruit.
    <br>And when I get there, I will now ask.
    <br>Prayer is: Ask, you shall be given. Knock, it shall be opened.
    <br>That is prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The picture of your life is, you are here and you are asking for fruit; you want fruit.
    <br>"I want fruit". Who will give you fruit?
    <br>You are far from the fruit.
    <br>Meditation removes the obstacles and takes you there.
    <br>It takes you to the realm of prayer - meditation.
    <br>This is why we say that meditation in God's Word is a visit with God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Meditation in God's Word is a visit with God".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Meditation in God's Word is a visit with God.
    <br>On what are we meditating? God's Word.
    <br>This is why we have given you faith bracelets.
    <br>Because it will be very difficult for a baby Christian without something on the outside to help you.
    <br>And if I just tell you to begin to meditate, and you are a baby Christian, it is not possible.
    <br>Distraction - everything you are seeing.
    <br>"What will I meditate?". "In Jesus' name".
    <br>"TB Joshua", "In Jesus' name".
    <br>There are so many distractions.
    <br>We have blessed this to help your spirit.
    <br>We have blessed this so that on the outside it will connect to your heart.
    <br>At the same time when you are busy with it, it will take you 'off'.
    <br>Your focus will be off the body, off the flesh.
    <br>And the word has been given to us - there is an anointed word: "Take more of me; give me more of You".
    <br>That is anointed for you - "Take more of me; give me more of You".
    <br>Do you know that something is greater than everything you have been waiting for?
    <br>Hearing from God is a much greater blessing than any of the blessings you are waiting for - to hear.
    <br>You know when you hear from God, you will know whether what you are asking for is the right thing to receive.
    <br>When you hear from God, you will know when to leave here.
    <br>When you hear from God, you will know who is talking to you.
    <br>When you hear from God, you will know when to go to work.
    <br>All this trouble that happens all over the world - people don't hear from God.
    <br>Hearing from God while praying is a much greater blessing than any blessing you are seeking - healing etc.
    <br>Hearing from God.
    <br>Look at my faith bracelet.
    <br>On the outside it helps baby Christians.
    <br>We are all baby Christians,
    <br>because I don't know the time you have for God apart from today,
    <br>and I don't know when you will spend so much time with God like this, apart from today.
    <br>And today, because there is no business outside there.
    <br>There is no work. The bank is not open.
    <br>If you are not coming here, you will sit at home.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you get back home today you have many issues to put right. Many issues.
    <br>You know, many issues.
    <br>You are ignorant of the things of God.
    <br>You see God as 'one of those things',
    <br>and God is not 'one of those things'. He is [The One].
    <br>Don't wait until your last day before you know God; you have to know God
    <br>because you have wasted so many years and time.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you know the plan of God for your life you will be crying that, "This is the plan of God for my life!".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A break in prayer is a break in God.
    <br>You should be ready at any time.
    <br>It is not when the situation is at hand, you pray.
    <br>You should always be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>Now, what is going on in your heart?
    <br>If you don't engage your heart, something else will take over your heart.
    <br>Right now, begin to engage your heart.
    <br>The heart cannot be neutral; it must say something.
    <br>You must take hold of your heart so that your past will not take hold of your heart -
    <br>where you are coming from, your situation.
    <br>You must take hold of your heart so that your past will not take hold of your heart.
    <br>Take hold of your heart.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
