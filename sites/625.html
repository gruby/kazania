    <br>By the authority of Jesus, I release you from all hurts.
    <br>I mean, deep hurts - bitterness and anger.
    <br>Be released!
    <br>Whatever affliction; be it hypertension, be it diabetes, be it liver problem, be it kidney problem, fibroid -

    <br>Out!
    <br>You fibroid - I command you out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>Continue to loose that grip.
    <br>Say, "You demon, I curse you, by the authority in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Where are you in my career, business, family?
    <br>Out!"
    <br>Command them out.
    <br>What is that demon in your business?
    <br>What is that demon in your career?
    <br>What is that demon tormenting your career?
    <br>What is that demon tormenting your family?
    <br>Say, "You demon, I curse you.
    <br>Be cursed!
    <br>Loose your grip in my life.
    <br>I curse you in my business, career, family.
    <br>Where are you?
    <br>Out!"
    <br>Command them out!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>- <Seitele>
    <br>- What do you mean by that?
    <br>I am a destroyer.
    <br>I am a bushdog.
    <br>Move like a bushdog!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Watch the screen of your TV.
    <br>This young man is manifesting as a bushdog right now.
    <br>The evil spirit within is being exposed, during the time of mass prayer.
    <br>He is moving like a dog, right now.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>- How many powers do you have?
    <br>- Eleven.
    <br>What are the powers?
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I've got loads in the brain.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Why are you doing this?
    <br>Because I put things in him.
    <br>I have affected his legs.
    <br>Why do you make him to eat his shoe?
    <br>I want to destroy him.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I made him a womaniser.
    <br>I invited the spirits of Succubus and Incubus from Egypt into his life.
    <br>Those spirits of lust are the greatest spirits of lust.
    <br>We can see a tattoo on his body.
    <br>What is the meaning of this tattoo?
    <br>They are a skull and bones that will never leave him until he becomes a skull and bones.
    <br>- How many of you are in this body?
    <br>- Eleven.
    <br>The spirits of lust - Succubus and Incubus from Egypt.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>What else?
    <br>The spirit of anger.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>The spirit of poverty.
    <br>How long have you been living in this body?
    <br>I have been living in his body since he was six years old.
    <br>His grandfather gave him to me.
    <br>What are the things you make him to do?
    <br>How do you use him?
    <br>I use him to womanise.
    <br>I enslave him to his education.
    <br>How did you enter him?
    <br>The demons from Egypt were invited by another demon.
    <br>This demon is the grand demon in him.
    <br>What is the meaning of that?
    <br>The demon that destroys. He'll never see anything until he turns to skull and bones.
    <br>How did that demon enter you?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>How did it enter you?
    <br>The grandfather gave him to me.
    <br>Move like a bushdog, right now!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I made him lust after woman.
    <br>Women fall for him.
    <br>He has three children by three women.
    <br>I subjected him to poverty.
    <br>He can't even feed them.
    <br>I enslaved him to his education.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Viewers around the world, you have seen this young man -
    <br>the evil spirit within him manifesting like an animal.
    <br>He has the characteristics of an animal right now.
    <br>You can see him moving like a dog, even to the extent of eating his own shoes,
    <br>which we know is not possible, unless by the influence of these demonic spirits.
    <br>So this is what is happening in our midst, as the mass prayer is going on,
    <br>and Jesus Christ is exposing all demonic activities in our midst.
    <br>Viewers around the world - get connected by faith and receive your own portion of blessing,
    <br>as the mass prayer is going on.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Alexander Johnson.
    <br>I'm a Liberian living in Ghana.
    <br>I came to testify to the goodness of God who delivered me from the powers or darkness,
    <br>the spirit of lust and several other spirits.
    <br>It all started way back when I was just a kid.
    <br>At the age of five to six, I was a pet to my grandfather.
    <br>Whenever there was a break from school, he would call for me and I would go back to the village.
    <br>Whenever he went, he took me.
    <br>My grandfather was someone who was highly traditional.
    <br>I was there so many times when he invited masquerades,
    <br>even the greatest masquerade that came to the village.
    <br>What no child, female or even a male who was not part of our society was allowed to see, I saw it.
    <br>I was afraid whenever the masquerade came around but he tried to talk to me
    <br>and said that I shouldn't be afraid.
    <br>There was something inside of me that hated it but I saw all the masquerades.
    <br>On one of my regular visits to my grandfather, he took me to the bush.
    <br>He said he was going there for farming, which was normal.
    <br>I remember when he took me to the bottom of a tree, cut it
    <br>and drew from it something like 'palm wine'.
    <br>He called me there and gave me the 'palm wine' to drink.
    <br>I really enjoyed it, although I realised only later it was 'palm wine'.
    <br>It tasted very different and I really enjoyed drinking it.
    <br>After that, a few days later, I was taken back to my mother.
    <br>Two days later, in the afternoon, a lady who was mentally impaired
    <br>called me to her and asked me to sleep with her.
    <br>I didn't resist as even at that tender age, I had the urge for it.
    <br>I refused to mention it to anybody except for a cousin of mine who saw us that day
    <br>and he too did not mention it to anybody.
    <br>You mean, immediately you were initiated in that bush by your grandfather,
    <br>that spirit came into you and at that very tender age,
    <br>you started having affairs with women.
    <br>And you say you started with a lady that had a mental disorder?
    <br>I started having this lustful urge at that age.
    <br>At what age were you then?
    <br>I was six years old but it started growing stronger as I grew up in life.
    <br>I didn't care who you were or your age, whether a big person or a small child,
    <br>I would see you and fall for you.
    <br>Whenever I came and approached you, you would always say OK.
    <br>I would feel OK doing it but then empty and bad afterwards.
    <br>So you mean, elderly women, women that were bigger than you,
    <br>when you meet them, they would all submit to you and you would have an affair with them?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What I am saying is that even as I was growing up to be more mature,
    <br>women were showing interest in me at that age.
    <br>It was only when I viewed Emmanuel TV that I realised demons were behind it.
    <br>Sometimes I would ask myself why an old lady would feel interested in me.
    <br>I would also be interested and only afterwards would I begin to regret.
    <br>So it was the demon power in you that was causing them to be attracted to you.
    <br>Yes, it was the demonic power doing that.
    <br>Then, a few times I went to our capital to stay with my aunty.
    <br>Two or three days after getting there, I was chased by a big dog.
    <br>Before then, I had a dream where I fought and defeated a dog.
    <br>Two days later, a big black dog chased me and bit me on my leg.
    <br>I started developing fear for dogs, although I loved animals.
    <br>Because of my love for them, I started finding ways to raise dogs.
    <br>However, I specifically resisted black dogs because I didn't like them.
    <br>Whenever I had a dream about dogs or saw a black dog trying to fight me,
    <br>afterwards, I would easily get angry and fight anyone I saw.
    <br>I started playing football at a very young age and people would praise me
    <br>because I played well and my coach liked me.
    <br>However, later I would be deprived of the captaincy or dropped from the team.
    <br>I kept fighting to play but it's not been easy because of this problem of anger.
    <br>Then, people who shouldn't be afraid of me would be afraid when I got angry.
    <br>People who were much older than me would be afraid when I got angry.
    <br>I started losing friends and support and faced rejection and isolation.
    <br>So, if you were to have an encounter with anyone in terms of fighting,
    <br>how would this spirit of bushdog manifest?
    <br>If anyone dared to cross my path when I was angry, they wouldn't survive it.
    <br>No matter how strong you were, I would fight you.
    <br>I remember fighting someone with a gun during the war in Liberia.
    <br>I took the gun from him, kept it and then gave it to the commander.
    <br>I didn't fight in the war but everybody who did was afraid of me because
    <br>when I got angry, I didn't care who you were or what you had.
    <br>This anger grew in me throughout my life, as well as the spirit of lust.
    <br>People knew me as a brilliant student and I began teaching computer skills
    <br>but all of my students, including those who employed me as a teacher,
    <br>I would fall in love with them and mostly end up in a sexual relationship.
    <br>Tell us, because of that demon bushdog that was in you,
    <br>anyone you had a relationship, affair with - what happened to them thereafter?
    <br>A few years ago, I realised that everyone I had a sexual relationship with
    <br>would begin to depreciate in everything they did and go down.
    <br>If that person owned a business, it would go down unless they left me.
    <br>Then, I would try to help the person but I also went down to poverty.
    <br>There was no way I could help.
    <br>Each attempt I made led me further downhill.
    <br>Some of the worst things this spirit pushed me to do was to have
    <br>several sexual relationships at the same time.
    <br>Because of that, I impregnated so many women.
    <br>I was introduced by friends to abortion, not the normal method but using herbal medicine.
    <br>It reached the extent that I became a herbal abortion doctor.
    <br>I knew everything about herbal abortion.
    <br>You mean, when you started helping those women you met doing abortion,
    <br>as you continued doing that, you perfected the art of aborting for others?
    <br>Yes, I started doing it for other people and getting paid for it.
    <br>You started making a business out of that?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This continued until I had a child and things became really bad for me.
    <br>My mother too was not doing anything but she saw how I was suffering
    <br>and said I should send the child back from Ghana to Liberia.
    <br>The child has been with my mum for three years.
    <br>A few years later, I got two girls pregnant at the same time.
    <br>The two of them came to me just a few days apart to say they were pregnant.
    <br>I was fed up of doing abortions and felt sorry for the lives I had taken away.
    <br>I said that no matter what the condition, the two mothers should keep the babies.
    <br>Now, I have two more kids who are just three weeks apart in age.
    <br>There are two women that had two kids for you almost at the same time?
    <br>Yes, they are three weeks apart in age.
    <br>I have three girls in total.
    <br>I was not able to cater for them because I lost everything.
    <br>The more I continued this lifestyle, the more I was losing everything.
    <br>One of the kids' mothers invited me to stay with her.
    <br>The other lady said that it seemed like I was cursed.
    <br>Even the first lady said I was cursed and went out with another guy.
    <br>Her life is improving now.
    <br>The other one's life seems to be improving too.
    <br>This lady said that she was going to stick with me until the end
    <br>but I said she was wasting her time because I had tried every effort.
    <br>However, she wouldn't stop.
    <br>When I went to stay in her house, she introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The man of God said that demons were behind the abnormal things you did.
    <br>OK. Before you tell us about your encounter with Emmanuel TV and eventually your deliverance,
    <br>you said you were tired of doing abortion,
    <br>to the extent you advised those ladies to leave the pregnancy. Right?
    <br>If you were to take record,
    <br>how many abortions do you think you have aided in your life?
    <br>I can't give an exact record
    <br>but from the time I was mature enough to have a child,
    <br>I was impregnating women, so I can't even give you a specific number.
    <br>It's more than 20.
    <br>Before you had an encounter with Emmanuel TV,
    <br>can you tell us what effort you made to find solution to this problem?
    <br>I went to several churches because my mum didn't allow me to go to herbalists.
    <br>Since I moved far from her, I went to several witchdoctors.
    <br>I gave up because I had tried every effort to stop this but to no avail.
    <br>This girl, who said she was going to stay with me, went to see a witchdoctor.
    <br>We did some of the things she said, like bathing ourselves, but after three days,
    <br>she called us that she had a final solution for me.
    <br>She said she encountered the people responsible for what happened to me
    <br>and they told her she should not attempt to do anything for me because
    <br>no man could help me and if she tried, she would be destroyed.
    <br>She told me that the only one who could help me in my situation was God.
    <br>I told her that I had been to churches and loved God.
    <br>She then advised me that if I came to The SCOAN, God would help me.
    <br>She said Prophet T.B. Joshua and his evangelists would be able to help me.
    <br>We saw a tattoo on your arm.
    <br>Can you show us the tattoo and tell us what that tattoo symbolises,
    <br>and what is the significance of that tattoo to your evil activities then?
    <br>Whatever I involved myself in doing, I did well and people praised me for that.
    <br>I also began to work as an artist, although I didn't go to school for it.
    <br>So, I was drawing tattoos on people.
    <br>One day, in the afternoon, something told me I had to give myself a tattoo.
    <br>I was thinking about which nice tattoo I could give myself.
    <br>The next day, the urge to do the tattoo grew stronger and I did it.
    <br>This tattoo on my arm was the first one I did.
    <br>When I was doing it, I was being inspired by something within me.
    <br>I didn't know why I did it and only realised afterwards what I had done.
    <br>I knew it was not as beautiful as the ones I did for others but I did it anyway.
    <br>What symbol are we seeing there on your arm?
    <br>According to the tattoo, this is the skull and bones.
    <br>I put the letter 'B' on top of it but I don't know the meaning.
    <br>So, it was that demon that was inspiring you to all this?
    <br>I can see now that it was the demon which led me to do it because I felt inspired to draw it.
    <br>Tell us how you got an encounter with Emmanuel TV and came to The SCOAN.
    <br>My very first encounter with Emmanuel TV was in 2009.
    <br>I was just watching out of frustration because my school had closed.
    <br>Then, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophecy about
    <br>Nigeria's qualification for the World Cup - and it was exact.
    <br>I was wondering who this man was who gave such an exact prophecy.
    <br>Something within me said I needed to go there for help but I overlooked it
    <br>until I moved into the house of the lady who is the mother of one of my children.
    <br>She gave me the last money she had to come down to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I came here, I was sitting in the church when Mass Prayer started.
    <br>Something was telling me to get out.
    <br>So, I tried to leave but one of the ushers halted me.
    <br>I said I was feeling dizzy but he told me to return to my seat.
    <br>During the Mass Prayer, I was feeling reluctant to pray.
    <br>However, something in me said this was the only hope I had and I should pray.
    <br>Immediately I said, "Out", I felt something beating me in my ears.
    <br>My hands and the place where I had the tattoo began burning seriously.
    <br>That was all I could remember.
    <br>We saw you doing many things, as you can see right now on the left side of the screen.
    <br>During the mass prayer we saw you moving like a bushdog
    <br>and also doing strange things, as eating your shoes and all that.
    <br>You mean, you didn't remember you had done all this?
    <br>I didn't even know.
    <br>There is no way I could have done these things.
    <br>There is no way I could eat my shoes that I should put on my feet.
    <br>Two or three nights later, I was sitting down watching Emmanuel TV and I saw this.
    <br>I wanted to cry like I always did when I had a problem
    <br>but I felt some peace inside;
    <br>I felt I should be crying then but I felt so happy and peaceful.
    <br>I did not even cry; I was just happy.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We know it was the demon in you that was speaking and said a lot of things.
    <br>The demon mentioned some strange names.
    <br>What do you know about that?
    <br>This spirit caused me to masturbate even when I didn't see a girl.
    <br>If I saw a girl and she was not married, I would do it.
    <br>At around 4 am, I had this urge.
    <br>When I woke up, something pushed me back to the bed.
    <br>While I was going to sleep, dozing, something just crossed the room
    <br>from the wall to the window.
    <br>There was a naked demon with horns.
    <br>There was a voice speaking to me, "Succubus and Incubus".
    <br>As a computer guy, I went to the internet and searched for the images.
    <br>I saw the exact figure that passed me.
    <br>I noticed that one of the succubuses, the one called Karina
    <br>is actually a succubus for Egypt.
    <br>So, when the demon said that it was the succubus from Egypt, it wasn't strange.
    <br>I was just happy that God had actually delivered me.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Since after your deliverance last service day, tell us,
    <br>what are the changes you have seen,
    <br>what are the things that you noticed about yourself that confirm that indeed
    <br>you have been taken out of the kingdom of darkness?
    <br>There have been so many changes.
    <br>Initially, I felt that I was not walking alone.
    <br>There was something inside of me; I was heavy.
    <br>After my deliverance, I feel very light, as if I could fly anytime.
    <br>That is one change and another one that I can really mention is this anger.
    <br>After I left here, there have been some people,
    <br>I don't know if they are provoking me or congratulating me,
    <br>they called me 'bushdog'.
    <br>There is this little girl that stays right opposite of where I stop.
    <br>When she sees me, she says, "Oh mama, see manifestation!"
    <br>Normally, if that happened to me, I would beat you.
    <br>You would call your father and I would beat him too.
    <br>Now, I feel like she is just joking.
    <br>Now, I feel peace inside.
    <br>I am no longer under the bondage of that demon.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>And in your dreams; do you see any strange things appearing to you anymore?
    <br>No, I don't see anything anymore.
    <br>Two or three days before I came and got my deliverance,
    <br>I was attacked by a dog again; a very big, black dog.
    <br>The dog couldn't reach me because I always carry the Morning Sticker around my neck.
    <br>The dog saw the Sticker and couldn't reach me, so, I held it by its mouth
    <br>and almost killed it; so, it ran away.
    <br>The next morning, when I took somebody to the road, I was surprised.
    <br>When the dogs in my area saw me, they liked me
    <br>but that day, they were angry with me and ran away from me.
    <br>Before my deliverance, I had the Anointing Sticker on my chest.
    <br>Physically, I always wear it.
    <br>In my dream, I noticed that the dog saw it and went back.
    <br>The next morning it happened physically that the dogs ran away from me.
    <br>After my deliverance, I am not having any strange dreams, I am OK.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your wonderful deliverance and this beautiful testimony.
    <br>Now, that the Lord God Almighty has delivered you,
    <br>what word of advice do you have for people who are listening to your wonderful testimony?
    <br>My advice is simple: When you see something not going normal with you,
    <br>demons don't care if they entered you before you were born
    <br>or if you grew up and agreed to it.
    <br>Whatever it is, the Bible says they come to steal, kill and destroy.
    <br>That is their only aim.
    <br>So, if you see anything abnormal happening to you,
    <br>like Prophet T.B. Joshua always says, "Don't run from God; run to Him."
    <br>Find a way to go to God and God is always there to deliver you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>And that crazy urge that you used to have, the lust after women -
    <br>do you still feel such an urge anymore?
    <br>It sounds funny but I see every girl now as a boy-child.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God in the highest. 
    <br>We thank God Almighty.
    <br>Now that you are delivered, remember, you are delivered to follow Him,
    <br>that is to follow Jesus, to make Him the Lord of your life,
    <br>and the only way to do so is to make His Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Read your Bible every day, in order to establish a relationship with the Holy Spirit,
    <br>and as you continue to do that, the Lord, God Almighty is about to restore you,
    <br>all that you have lost, as the result of this demonic influence, and torment in your life.
    <br>And we believe someday you are coming back to testify to that blessing, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
