    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Right now, begin to confess your deliverance and healing because I can see you being healed.
    <br>Confess your deliverance; I can see you being delivered.
    <br>Confess your freedom because I can see you being forgiven.
    <br>I can see you being forgiven. I can see you being delivered. I can see you being healed.
    <br>Confess your healing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Faith is expecting Jesus to do what He promised.
    <br>Begin to confess your healing. I am healed; Jesus is my Healer.
    <br>I am delivered; Jesus is my Deliverer.
    <br>Confess your freedom; I can see you being free.
    <br>Confess it and give a chance to God.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Remember, whatever you are complaining about is darkness.

    <br>That affliction is darkness.
    <br>I command you out of darkness!
    <br>Whatever you are going through that is giving you nightmare,
    <br>I command you out of darkness!
