    <br>PRAYER FOR HEALING WITH PROPHET TB JOSHUA!!!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are, whatever sickness,
    <br>I order all pain, all infection, to leave your body in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your kidneys, in your blood, I order them to leave your body, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your kidneys, in your blood, in your muscles, in your bones, out!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Whatever name they call your sickness, never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>I order that sickness, I order that disease.
    <br>I say, I command that disease to leave your body,
    <br>to leave your bones, to leave your blood, to leave your muscles, to leave your kidneys,
    <br>to leave your bones, to leave your flesh, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Where can they hide?
    <br>Your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost. Where can disease hide?
    <br>My body is a temple of the Holy Ghost!
    <br>Your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost. Where can they hide?
    <br>Every hidden pain, every hidden disease, every hidden sickness, I command them out in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command them out in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua. Touch Your Screen By Faith in Jesus' Name.
    <br>Viewers, my body is a temple of the Holy Ghost. Your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Where can sickness hide? Where can disease hide?
    <br>Where can affliction hide?
    <br>Where can infection hide?
    <br>Holy Ghost!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua. Touch Your Screen By Faith in Jesus' Name.
