  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>wherever you are, I want to start from you.
    <br>Whatever situation, wherever you are right now, begin to come against every infirmity in your life.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>begin to come against every infirmity,
    <br>every spirit that stands against you,
    <br>every spirit that hinders you way,
    <br>every spirit that hinders you,
    <br>every spirit that causes you limitation,
    <br>every spirit that causes shortcomings.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to stand against every spirit, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Right now, order that spirit to go.
    <br>Begin to order the spirit to go right now.
    <br>That spirit of killing, stealing, destruction,
    <br>that spirit that causes you setback,
    <br>that spirit that causes shortcomings - begin to order the spirit, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I order the spirit out of your life, career, business and finances, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, confess your freedom.
    <br>Confess your freedom right now.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Every hidden sickness in your body,
    <br>every hidden disease in your body,
    <br>every hidden affliction in your system, I command them out!
    <br>I command them out!
    <br>In your blood - out!
    <br>In your kidneys - out!
    <br>In your liver - out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Confess your healing.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you have been
    <br>claiming your right;
    <br>there is nothing wrong with that.
    <br>You can claim your right
    <br>but don't hold unto an offence.
    <br>You can claim your right but don't hold onto an offence.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold onto an offence.
    <br>You must be free from offence.
    <br>Offences imprison you - self-imprisonment.
    <br>When you hold onto an offence, you have imprisoned yourself.
    <br>Offence of this.
    <br>Offence of that.
    <br>You have imprisoned yourself.
    <br>The Bible says, our spirit must be free to contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>Viewers, listen! Your spirit must be free.
    <br>I am not saying that you should not claim your right,
    <br>but don't hold onto an offence.
    <br>Offences imprison one.
    <br>Your spirit must be free from all offences.
    <br>Wrong accusation, whatever it is -
    <br>whether you are right or wrong,
    <br>your spirit must be free to contact the Spirit of God.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release your spirit from the pain of the past!
    <br>I release your spirit from past accusation!
    <br>I release your spirit from the pain of the past - past persecution, past pain - be released!
    <br>I say to your spirit, be released!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I know you are going through major trouble, hatred, persecution,
    <br>whatever you are going through - misjudged or whatever.
    <br>You have no right to hold onto an offence.
    <br>I release you from the pain of the past, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I release you from hurt - I mean deep hurt, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>There is hurt, and there is deep hurt.
    <br>Someone will say, "I can never forgive".
    <br>"No, no, no."
    <br>It is deep hurt.
    <br>I release you from hurt - deep hurt, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released from hurt - deep hurt, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Rejoice.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and pray to meet you there again.
