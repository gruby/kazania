    <br>Thank you. You are welcome.
    <br>I know you might have been praying since morning
    <br>and you pray for me?
    <br>How many of us here pray for me?
    <br>Say the prayer you offer.
    <br>That God abundantly will continue to bless you and you will live a long life.
    <br>So that I can be praying for you.
    <br>Distribution Of The New Anointing Water & Sticker To Partners In Nigeria
    <br>I pray that God should continue to strengthen you; that you will live long for us.
    <br>So that I can pray for your grandchildren.
    <br>I pray that the vision will grow more wider - that was my prayer. The vision will not die. To expand.
    <br>It will expand there for you.
    <br>Who else again?
    <br>I prayed that God should increase your grace, and the grace will extend to us, in Jesus' name.
    <br>To your grandchildren.
    <br>Thank you. You are here to receive the Anointing Water.
    <br>You have seen the other countries.
    <br>Even in America - they just place the Anointing Water on the table
    <br>and they pick it and the blessing happens
    <br>- and different countries like Ukraine and others.
    <br>But for me to come into your presence again ...
    <br>You might have acknowledged your challenges, your weakness.
    <br>To acknowledge your challenges is a victory.
    <br>For you to say, "I'm a smoker. I don't want to smoke again",
    <br>is a victory itself if you really mean it.
    <br>That is the reason why you are here.
    <br>You must mean it with all your heart.
    <br>If I'm right ...
    <br>So right now, I'm going to lay my hand on you.

    <br>Healed Of Blindness Due To Diabetes
    <br>After Prayer From Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>My name is Oluwafunmike.
    <br>I am from Ondo State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN today was that I cannot see.
    <br>I had gone blind due to diabetes.
    <br>I went to America to help my daughter take care of her newly born baby boy.
    <br>But diabetes didn't allow me to do anything.
    <br>I could not tell her that my eyes were not okay.
    <br>And that is why I said that I should return to Nigeria.
    <br>I always fell down.You can see the wound on my knee.
    <br>While coming here today, my granddaughter had to hold my hand.
    <br>When the man of God came, I could not see him until he reached me.
    <br>All the hospitals I went to told me that because diabetes had damaged my eyes they could not help me.
    <br>This is my granddaughter that brought me today.
    <br>When the man of God reached me, I cried because I was blind.
    <br>I told him that I had returned from America to Nigeria because of my blindness.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, God immediately restored my sight.
    <br>I thank God that now I can walk; I can do everything on my own.
    <br>I don't need my granddaughter to help me anymore.
    <br>Thank You, Almighty God!
    <br>My name is Oluwatomisin.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my grandmother.
    <br>I only came to church today because she could not come on her own.
    <br>The man of God touched her and immediately she confirmed that she could see.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I feel very happy because she does not need my help to take her around anymore.
    <br>She can now walk on her own and go to wherever she wants to go.
    <br>Can you see that I'm walking on my own?
    <br>I can do everything on my own.
    <br>I even see all these trees.
    <br>So, I thank God! Now I am free.
    <br>I can see you people now. You are close to me.
    <br>What colour is this dress?
    <br>This one is red, blue and white.

    <br>My name is Osas.
    <br>I am from Abuja, Nigeria. I am an Emmanuel TV Partner.
    <br>Before coming, I used to have pain in my chest for more than five years.
    <br>I had been taking drugs.
    <br>I came today to collect my Anointing Water.
    <br>I was the first person the man of God laid hands on.
    <br>As he touched me, I felt a shock all over my body.
    <br>When I got up, I felt so free and light.
    <br>The pain and symptoms had gone.
    <br>My family and I are free, to the glory of God.
    <br>I am going home with my own testimony, to the glory of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free; my family is free, for the glory of God.

    <br>My name is Chidinma.
    <br>I am from Rivers State, Nigeria.
    <br>I was called as an Emmanuel TV Partner to come and receive the Anointing Water and the Sticker.
    <br>During the process, when the man of God touched me, I felt a sensation all over my body.
    <br>Then, during the time of collecting the Anointing Water, I manifested.
    <br>Before now I couldn't wave with this hand.
    <br>I could not raise it higher than this.
    <br>People thought it strange and that I did not want to greet them, but it was because of pain.
    <br>But now I can raise it up very well.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am delivered! I am free! Thank You!
    <br>I have no pain; the pain left me instantly.

    <br>My name is Comrade Bright. I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>I work for an oil company but I was called to receive the Anointing Water today from The SCOAN
    <br>and I received double anointing
    <br>because I was experiencing pain in my ear drum.
    <br>It was making a noise and water was coming out of it.
    <br>It happened three years ago when I used my car keys to scratch my ear.
    <br>This damaged my ear and I went to the hospital.
    <br>They told me that my ear drum was faulty.
    <br>Ever since I have been managing it.
    <br>It has been making a noise and releasing water.
    <br>Today when I came to receive the Anointing Water,
    <br>as Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, immediately the noise stopped,
    <br>and the pain in the ear drum pain also stopped.
    <br>Now I am healed and delivered!
    <br>Previously when I bowed my head down, it used to make a noise.
    <br>But now I can bow down and it is not making a noise any longer.
    <br>Everything has stopped and I am healed.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>And now that you have received the New Anointing Water and Sticker,
    <br>what do you believe that God has in store for you?
    <br>I believe that God has done many things in the life of my family
    <br>and there are still more things ahead with this Anointing Water
    <br>that God will still use to do for me.

    <br>My name is Oghenekohwo. I'm from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>I came here to collect the New Anointing Water as an Emmanuel TV Partner.
    <br>I was feeling heavy and had pain all over my body.
    <br>When I came, I was touched by the man of God.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, I began to manifest and I saw myself on the ground.
    <br>I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>I received my deliverance.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I feel very light and free.
    <br>I have no more pain or heaviness.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am healed now!
    <br>Thank You, Father!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!

    <br>My name is Charity and I am from Ebonyi State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am an Emmanuel TV Partner.
    <br>He has taken my sorrow away
    <br>He has taken my pain away
    <br>Hallelujah! Jesus is mine.
    <br>The God of Prophet T.B. Joshua is awesome!
    <br>He has wiped my tears away today.
    <br>An ulcer I have had for thirty-two years is gone.
    <br>The man of God touched and prayed for me.
    <br>I vomited.
    <br>When I vomited, the stomach ulcer was healed. Previously I could not touch here due to the pain.
    <br>I could not eat fried food or pepper.
    <br>When we had lunch, I realised that I ate fried rice and stew without pain.
    <br>Formerly I could not do this.
    <br>An ulcer I had for thirty-two years is gone just from a touch of the man of God.
    <br>I want to give all the glory to the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And I want to thank God for the gift of Prophet T.B. Joshua to this generation.
    <br>Because without him I don't know what our lives would have been like.
    <br>I want to thank God for his life, his humility, the grace of God upon his life and for obeying his God.
    <br>May God continue to increase His anointing and His grace will never run dry, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>The New Anointing Water is an atomic bomb.
    <br>It blows away sickness and pain.
    <br>Poverty, hardship, stagnation is gone.
    <br>My family is delivered. It is not only me that is delivered.
    <br>And this good news, I will take it to my friends who are in need and have problems.
    <br>The Lord who has delivered me and my family will deliver them too through this Anointing Water.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!

    <br>My name is Christian.
    <br>I am a legal practitioner and also a priest.
    <br>The man of God invited me as an Emmanuel TV Partner to receive the Anointing Water.
    <br>And as I came, he touched me and I felt a vibration on my spine which went down to my legs.
    <br>The pain in my spine and legs made it difficult for me to walk,
    <br>and at times I would feel very tired.
    <br>Everything just ended and I felt like something went out of me.
    <br>Because when the evil spirit was talking, I discovered that they had been the activities of an evil spirit.
    <br>The evil spirit actually mentioned that he was a strong man operating in my life to destroy me.
    <br>I believe this because a lot of things happened in my past.
    <br>There was a criminal case where I had a partnership with another person and he ran away.
    <br>When this matter started in 2012, I sent a text message to the man of God to tell him about it.
    <br>He replied and said that he was praying for me.
    <br>That gave me the assurance that my own prayer had gone to heaven and that heaven had replied.
    <br>So, all through the matter and the trial I did not have any doubt about what God had done.
    <br>Two weeks ago the Lord gave me the victory in the Federal High Court.
    <br>I was acquitted of the charges.
    <br>After the prayer I felt so strong.
    <br>All the pains in my body, especially in my spine, had stopped.
    <br>I could see my spirit being reinvigorated, recreated with a new life.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. The pains have disappeared.
    <br>I can now bend and walk. All my pain is gone.
    <br>I give glory to God, in Jesus' name. Amen.

    <br>My name is Grace and I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>When I was nine months pregnant I noticed that my baby had stopped kicking.
    <br>I went to the clinic and the doctor told me that the baby had died and that they wanted to remove the baby.
    <br>I refused.
    <br>I went home and watched Emmanuel TV and saw our father in the Lord,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, introducing this New Anointing Water.
    <br>I touched the screen and then my stomach, and immediately the baby started kicking and turning.
    <br>I went back to the same clinic and they asked me what happened.
    <br>I said that when I got home, I touched the screen of Emmanuel TV
    <br>where Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed with the New Anointing Water, then the baby started kicking.
    <br>I then delivered my baby safely.
    <br>This is the baby I delivered without an operation.
    <br>This is the baby that they said was a dead baby.
    <br>She is almost three months old and her name is Value.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Today my father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has blessed me with this New Anointing Water
    <br>as an Emmanuel TV Partner. Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, Lord!

    <br>My name is Oladunjoye and the beautiful woman beside me is my wife.
    <br>We are both Emmanuel TV Partners and we are here in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>We were invited to collect our new Anointing Water and Sticker
    <br>and to the glory of God I received a double portion of the blessing today.
    <br>As the man of God prayed for my wife and I, and I also received my healing.
    <br>I have been seriously sick since the last week of January.
    <br>I had bronchitis and it affected me greatly.
    <br>I couldn't breathe and I couldn't do anything.
    <br>I was in serious pain.
    <br>At one stage I thought that I was going to die and I began to pray against death.
    <br>I engaged a doctor who came to treat me at my home and we were so shocked that this happened now.
    <br>I was experiencing a sharp pain on this side of my body up to my ribs.
    <br>I was taking antibiotics but they were not working.
    <br>But today, I want to bless the name of God.
    <br>When my family and I came to collect the Anointing Water,
    <br>we were told that the man of God was also going to pray with us.
    <br>When I stepped onto the Prayer Mountain I started receiving my deliverance - I started coughing.
    <br>The coughing was so severe that I was vomiting.
    <br>But I give God the glory because that was the beginning of my deliverance.
    <br>I want to tell you that Jesus is alive.
    <br>The moment the man of God touched me I received a permanent healing.
    <br>My pains disappeared.
    <br>My knees used to pain and I couldn't climb stairs.
    <br>But today, after the man of God touched me, I could even twist my leg and
    <br>I could raise my hand.
    <br>The pains are no longer there.
    <br>I want to bless the name of God because this is awesome.
    <br>Jesus has done a great thing in my life and the lives of my family.
    <br>My name is Mrs Oladunjoye.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband.
    <br>We are here today to give glory to God,
    <br>to thank His holy name, to appreciate Him,
    <br>because only He is worthy of our praise, thanksgiving and testimony.
    <br>Everything that my husband has explained is true - even more than that.
    <br>I struggled to sleep because I kept checking on my husband, like with a baby.
    <br>He would breathe, then cough at times for one hour without stopping.
    <br>I was very afraid but I continued to call upon the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>And I thank God that He has rescued the family.
    <br>The day before we were called, I had a dream.
    <br>In the dream I saw the man of God and he greeted me, "Good Morning!".
    <br>I ran, confused, and said, "Good afternoon, sir".
    <br>He said, "Look at her. She is not in the spirit".
    <br>I said, "Daddy, I am very sorry. Good Morning, Daddy! Good Morning, sir!
    <br>My husband is very sick".
    <br>He said , "Yes, don't worry. Don't panic. I know".
    <br>I said, "You know?". He said, "Yes, I know".
    <br>I said, "When are you coming to my house? When are you coming to visit me?".
    <br>He said, "Very soon I coming to see the family".
    <br>I said, "Thank You, Jesus! Thank You", and I woke up.
    <br>When I woke up I shared the dream with my husband and we prayed and thanked God.
    <br>The following day Emmanuel TV called us and we were very happy.
    <br>And it increased my faith.
    <br>I told my husband, "Yes, we are serving a living God - a God that is alive and is with us!".
    <br>When we came here today we were told that the man of God was around and he came out.
    <br>And he told us that we were not only going to receive the Anointing Water, but he was going to pray with us.
    <br>He came and touched my husband and I, prayed with us, and we both received our own healing.
    <br>As my husband was vomiting, I was also vomiting.
    <br>I give glory to God and I thank God for giving us double portion.
    <br>I am here with my children and they were all touched today.
    <br>I give glory to the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I want to appreciate God.
    <br>I thank Jesus for what He has done for us as a family today.
    <br>Emmanuel!

    <br>Healed Of Bronchitis
    <br>After Prayer From Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I couldn't do this before.
    <br>In fact when I attempted to breathe, I could only breathe halfway.
    <br>Because when I tried to breathe, suddenly it would stop halfway.
    <br>I give God the glory because immediately when Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me
    <br>I realised that my lungs opened
    <br>and I started coughing.
    <br>Mucus started coming out of my system.
    <br>And even after the man of God left me, I continued vomiting.
    <br>I give God the glory that I am free!
    <br>All the pain in my body has disappeared
    <br>and I give God the glory.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!

    <br>My name is Elizabeth and I am from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>I received a call to come and collect Anointing Water.
    <br>My problem was that I have had general body pains for three years
    <br>and I have been taking tablets every day and night.
    <br>But today when the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, came to me and touched me
    <br>I fell down and manifested.
    <br>After my manifestation, I stood up and all the pain had left me.
    <br>Previously I could not do this and I could not bend down.
    <br>As you are exercising your body now, are you feeling any pain?
    <br>I don't feel any pain at all.
    <br>I thank God for everything,
    <br>because what I asked God, He did for me today.
    <br>I prayed for a touch, and today the man of God touched me.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Jesus you are wonderful.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me and my family.
    <br>I am also blessed with the Anointing Water and the Stickers which the man of God gave to me today.

    <br>My name is Uzoma and I am from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I was invited to come and receive the New Anointing Water as an Emmanuel TV Partner.
    <br>When the man of God came, I complained to him that I was seeing double
    <br>which was caused by a car accident in 2019.
    <br>I then went into a coma.
    <br>When I was conscious again, I realised that I was seeing double - everything was appearing double to me.
    <br>Explain how this condition affected you.
    <br>Of course I could not drive because if I was on the road,
    <br>the road would appear double - one on top and one below.
    <br>It was confusing.
    <br>I could not read at that time.
    <br>When I looked at people, they also appeared double.
    <br>It affected my ability to walk on the street.
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me I felt a sensation.
    <br>I opened my eyes and I could see everything clearly and in single form.
    <br>I can now move around with ease and drive a car.
    <br>I thank God that I am healed! I don't have double vision anymore.
    <br>To the glory of God, we want to give you a Bible to read
    <br>to prove the mighty healing you have received today after Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.
    <br>John chapter 3.
    <br>"There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
    <br>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto Him,
    <br>'Rabbi, we know that Thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles
    <br>that Thou doest, except God be with Him'.
    <br>Jesus answered and said unto him,
    <br>'Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God' ".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I can read. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>How did the text appear if you tried to read before the prayer?
    <br>The text appeared double.
    <br>And right now?
    <br>But now everything is single - as normal.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!

    <br>I want to thank God for what He has done in my life today.
    <br>I was invited as an Emmanuel TV Partner to receive my Anointing Water.
    <br>I have been sick for almost a year.
    <br>I have been to many hospitals for treatment, and the doctors told me that I have a stomach ulcer.
    <br>Even though I have taken a lot of drugs,
    <br>I have been having a lot of pain all over my body, including my back.
    <br>I could not do any strenuous jobs.
    <br>Whenever I raised my arms I encountered pain.
    <br>I was praying to God before I received the phone call to come.
    <br>I thank God that I was here today.
    <br>The man of God laid his hands on me and I complained to him that I had an ulcer.
    <br>He prayed for me, touching my stomach, and I felt a sensation and started vomiting.
    <br>When I finished vomiting I realised that the pain has disappeared.
    <br>I became free and healed.
    <br>I want to thank God for what the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua has done for me.
    <br>I want to use this medium to appreciate Prophet T.B. Joshua for supporting me and my household.
    <br>I pray that God Almighty will continue to increase him more and more, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Previously I could not touch my stomach and do this.
    <br>You mean before now you could not do this?
    <br>Yes, I could not do this as I was in too much pain.
    <br>But now, the pain has gone.
    <br>I thank Jesus for what He has done. I am free forever.
    <br>And I will return for a bigger testimony, in Jesus' name.
