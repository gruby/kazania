  <p>    
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer in the mighty name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>all the works of satan in the lives of the people are destroyed,
    <br>bringing them out of the kingdom of darkness and into the kingdom of light.
    <br>As the man of God prays for this woman,
    <br>she falls to the ground as the evil spirit inside her begins to manifest.
    <br>Let us hear what it has to say.
    <br>I am a snake from the father's side.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>No peace. She thinks she wants to be married. For what?
    <br>There's no peace. The husband has another woman - for two years.
    <br>They have four children.
    <br>Eighteen years of marriage and he doesn't want to talk to her.
    <br>She took his money and ran away and came here - for what?
    <br>You people cannot deliver her. For what? Nothing!
    <br>She opened a business - she can't sell. The husband will close it.
    <br>Yes, everybody on the father's side - no marriage.
    <br>She is the one that said she wants to marry.
    <br>She is married for what?
    <br>As you can see, the woman is not herself.
    <br>She falls to the ground as the evil spirit - the snake -
    <br>that destroyed her marriage manifests.
    <br>No peace in her marriage. She hates the husband. They are fighting; every day, they are fighting.
    <br>From the father's side.
    <br>After the confession, T.B. Joshua delivers her in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for setting me free!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Angel Nwokoye.
    <br>I am originally from Mozambique but I live in South Africa.
    <br>I want to thank God that I came to The SCOAN, and I was located on the prayer line on Monday.
    <br>I was delivered from the spirit of snake that had been tormenting my marriage.
    <br>That spirit used to tell me to leave my marriage.
    <br>But I discovered that my husband, after our first child -
    <br>I didn't know that he had another child with another woman outside.
    <br>Three weeks after, he then told me that there was another woman who had a child for him,
    <br>that she came to his shop without the child.
    <br>After that, he was drinking, smoking, womanising and gambling.
    <br>Whenever I tried to talk to him, there was no peace; we would fight at home
    <br>and the children were scattered.
    <br>Because of that, I tried to report him to my dad.
    <br>My dad said he cannot do anything because I said I wanted to marry a Nigerian,
    <br>so I should go ahead and take care of myself.
    <br>Both my mother's family and my father's family abandoned me.
    <br>There was no one to help.
    <br>So now, I thought that I have four children with him.
    <br>For two years, he has been living with another lady; he only comes home to change.
    <br>He has rented a house for the woman in South Africa, taking care of the lady.
    <br>I even tried to confront the lady. The lady said she is not going to leave him
    <br>because he is the one who put her into that relationship
    <br>so if he wants, he must leave her but she is not leaving.
    <br>So now, when he decided that he was leaving, to come to Anambra (Nigeria),
    <br>because he is a Nigerian --
    <br>When he left, there was a friend of his that was supposed to bring money for him.
    <br>What I decided to do after he had left - I took that money,
    <br>I bought a ticket to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I arrived here on Sunday, I thank God that he located me through the prayer line,
    <br>and the man of God took care of me; he even gave me 15,000 naira
    <br>for my upkeep, food and everything.
    <br>So after that, I was delivered and set free.
    <br>When I was set free and went to the lodge to sleep,
    <br>the snake came to me, asking me what it was that I was doing.
    <br>That I now came to The SCOAN to seek for help to be delivered - for what?
    <br>When I tried to wake up to see who was talking, the snake vanished.
    <br>It vanished; I couldn't see it again.
    <br>That is how I realised that I was free and set free indeed.
    <br>Man of God, I thank you for what you have done for me.
    <br>I am here to seek God's intervention upon my marriage.
    <br>I have four kids with him.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me; I have nowhere to go!
    <br>I want my husband back but it is not in my hands; I don't want to go to the street with my kids.
    <br>We have just heard a wonderful testimony.
    <br>In other words, ever since you have been delivered,
    <br>you no longer see that snake?
    <br>No more - I'm free!
    <br>To God be the glory! And you are also here to know God's opinion about your marriage.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>To God be the glory! What about your husband?
    <br>I don't know where he is right now.
    <br>Ok, to God be the glory. This was a case that happened last week.
    <br>After she was delivered, the man of God took it upon himself
    <br>to ask the evangelists to invite her husband.
    <br>And to the glory of God, we believe her husband is in the midst of the people here right now.
    <br>So we want to invite him forward.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Ndubuisi Chika Nowokoye.
    <br>I am from Oka in Anambra State (Nigeria), residing in South Africa.
    <br>This is my junior sister - the last one from my mother's womb.
    <br>This woman is my wife.
    <br>It is true that she has four kids with me.
    <br>I met her seventeen years ago in South Africa.
    <br>She is resident in South Africa but originally from Mozambique.
    <br>So, when I met her, I approached her like a man approaches a lady.
    <br>From there, we entered into a relationship.
    <br>But before then, I had broken out from a relationship with a lady who has a kid for me.
    <br>When I met her, I approached her; we continued going from there.
    <br>She has a family in South Africa.
    <br>Her grandfather is living in South Africa; her grandmother is living in South Africa with their children.
    <br>So we went and met them.
    <br>After that approach to marry her, to which she agreed,
    <br>I went to Mozambique to pay marriage rights and everything.
    <br>First year to the fourth year, the marriage was so sweet.
    <br>Then, I don't know what happened, she wanted to 'ride' me; she wanted to be the man of the house.
    <br>She wanted to order me to do what she wanted.
    <br>I said, no, I am from Oka.
    <br>As far as I am concerned, no woman can put us under this thing.
    <br>It is true that I am in South Africa but I know where I come from.
    <br>No woman I know can put me in a cage, that whatever she says, is what I will do now.
    <br>She wants to know about my money, who I do business with, where I keep the money.
    <br>So, many times she would be threatening me that she will take the children and go;
    <br>that I will not see the children.
    <br>She has done it more than five times.
    <br>At a time, it was unbearable.
    <br>So, I complained to my sisters and family at home.
    <br>They were telling me that I know where I come from;
    <br>don't let a woman kill you in South Africa.
    <br>If worse comes to worse, let her go.
    <br>But I tried to patch up.
    <br>It came to a stage where I felt no more happiness in me.
    <br>It made me to drink a lot and go out.
    <br>Whenever I decided to go back home, my heart would tremble.
    <br>I would say, no, let me leave her at home and have my pleasure in the bar.
    <br>Six months ago, I had a fatal accident when I was about to go home.
    <br>I was drunk, driving home.
    <br>My car tumbled eight times; I nearly died.
    <br>I came out alive, nothing happened to me, but the car is beyond repair - crushed -
    <br>because of this woman.
    <br>So at the end of the day, I said to myself, no, for me to die,
    <br>I don't want to die for this woman; let me let her go.
    <br>I told her that I am travelling to Nigeria to visit my parents but she didn't know my plan.
    <br>My plan was that I am fed up.
    <br>I don't need her again.
    <br>I'm tired of the miserable life we have been living for 12 years now.
    <br>So, I came to Nigeria to look for a wife but I did not tell my parents.
    <br>I did not tell my father and sisters.
    <br>Whenever they are asking of her, I would be saying, she is fine.
    <br>When I call her phone, her phone is on voicemail.
    <br>Then, I don't know what happened, the whole Saturday I was stressed.
    <br>I asked myself, what happened now.
    <br>Maybe she has run away again because she ran away with the children many times.
    <br>Many times she ran away with my money and misuse it.
    <br>The next day being Sunday, I had a call from friends that they saw my wife in The SCOAN.
    <br>I said, what?
    <br>So does this mean that this woman left a kid of six months with other children for Nigeria?
    <br>But if she is in The SCOAN, I don't know, but I want to hear what the man of God will say.
    <br>They said that they saw her; she manifested.
    <br>I used to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I know what the man of God can do.
    <br>But now I have decided that I don't want this woman; I don't need her again.
    <br>On Monday, I had a call from The SCOAN. They said that the man of God wants to see me.
    <br>Hey! That's a call I can't refuse!
    <br>If it were her mother, father or brother, I wouldn't come.
    <br>But because of this call - it is a call I cannot say no to.
    <br>I called my sister that there is a call from The SCOAN,
    <br>and that there is nothing I can do; I have to come.
    <br>But what I want to tell the man of God - please, I know you get it directly from Heaven,
    <br>what is God saying here, but for me, it's okay.
    <br>I'm full.
    <br>So, I want the man of God to help me, to tell me so that I can continue looking for what I'm looking for.
    <br>We thank God for this occasion.
    <br>Could you, sir, tell us how many children the woman has for you.
    <br>Four.
    <br>To God be the glory. And you are here to hear God's opinion from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Yes, because I know that the man of God hears directly from Heaven.
    <br>Whatever he says to me now is what God says.
    <br>And that is the final conclusion.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>As we all know, the man of God, where he is, we believe he is listening to this situation,
    <br>and by the special grace of God, he will be coming out in the power of the Holy Ghost
    <br>to address this situation.
    <br>Let's wait patiently for the man of God's arrival.
    <br>Let's hear briefly from your younger sister.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chinyere Nwokoye.
    <br>I'm from Oka (Nigeria).
    <br>The man standing beside me is my elder brother.
    <br>The lady next to him is his wife Angel.
    <br>I've been hearing so many complaints from them.
    <br>Almost every week, they called me from South Africa.
    <br>If they don't call me, they call my elder sister,
    <br>complaining about one thing or the other.
    <br>But what I'm going to say is that I believe what is happening in their home is not ordinary.
    <br>So I plead with the man of God to also deliver my brother
    <br>as he has delivered the wife.
    <br>So I'm pleading with the man of God to deliver my brother too
    <br>so that peace will reign in their home.
    <br>As we have heard it earlier on, the man of God is in the best position
    <br>to tell the whole world God's position in this marriage,
    <br>and God bless you as you wait patiently to hear from the man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I was listening to my brother, and the sister has said it all.
    <br>Mr Nwokoye & Family - Nigerian Living In South Africa
    <br>The reason why my sister here was misbehaving in the house
    <br>was as a result of this evil spirit and she has been delivered.
    <br>Now you will have the good of her.
    <br>Now you are having a wife.
    <br>Now you too need to be delivered.
    <br>What marriage now after four children?
    <br>It is true you people have married but it is time now to rededicate your marriage.
    <br>She is free now from the past.
    <br>You too need to be free now from the past.
    <br>You know I said challenges - she has a lot of challenges, and God has delivered her.
    <br>You too have a lot of challenges, even to the extent that you went outside the marriage to have a child.
    <br>And I'm very happy for the honour you give to God.
    <br>And I want to tell you that I'm part of your family.
    <br>My sister, thank you very much for your intervention.
    <br>I want to tell the whole world that this marriage is from God.
    <br>After your deliverance, I want to invite you people again back from South Africa.
    <br>This is your home, and your home is also my home.
    <br>So, I want to tell you that I'm one of your brothers; thank you very much.
    <br>She's a wonderful wife; it is just satan, and satan has been removed.
    <br>On your own side too, satan needs to be removed
    <br>so you people can live in one accord.
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Following the words of the man of God,
    <br>that the deliverance of the husband will cement the marriage that is from Heaven,
    <br>removing the satanic influence and allowing them to live in one accord.
    <br>The husband was delivered in the power of the Holy Spirit
    <br>when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for him in Jesus' name.
    <br>The wife also receives a final touch.
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>And rising to their feet after the deliverance, they thank God and embrace in Jesus' name.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God, good morning!
    <br>My name is Angel Nwokoye.
    <br>I am originally from Mozambique but I live in South Africa.
    <br>The wonderful man beside me is my lovely husband.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>I'm here to thank God for my deliverance two weeks ago
    <br>when I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I came here and had an encounter with the man of God,
    <br>and I was delivered from the spirit of snake.
    <br>That spirit had really been tormenting me.
    <br>It was real because when I was growing up as a child,
    <br>I went to my father's village
    <br>and that is where my grandmother was telling me the story
    <br>that there is a house where that snake lives.
    <br>That my great-grandfather was a native doctor,
    <br>my grandfather was a native doctor, and my dad was the one
    <br>that was supposed to take over but he did not.
    <br>So the snake was moving around now, causing my sisters and everybody not to get married,
    <br>which was, I think, during that time that the snake entered me but I did not know.
    <br>So during that time my husband and I would be fighting; there was no peace.
    <br>I discovered that I normally used to see that snake on my pillow;
    <br>sometimes I used to see it between my husband and I.
    <br>I used to tell him that I used to dream of this big snake
    <br>that is coming in between us.
    <br>He would say, no problem, this thing will go.
    <br>But at the end of the day, I started noticing that this thing now -
    <br>I fighting with my husband and thinking that I could correct him - I'm not God.
    <br>Then it must have been this snake that is making him to hate me,
    <br>and making me to leave the house and misbehave.
    <br>So, during that time, I was watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>the man of God was telling us that in relationship and marriage,
    <br>you should stay true to God; don't budge, let God release you.
    <br>And I would be saying, how will God release me because I was already in pain;
    <br>I was undergoing depression. I didn't know who to talk to.
    <br>When I called my dad, he would tell me I should take the kids, come home and leave this man.
    <br>I would be saying, I know this is not the right thing to do
    <br>because where can I go with four kids; they are all his,
    <br>and there is nowhere I could go to, so why should my dad be saying this.
    <br>To the point when I now talked to my friends, nobody came up with a good advice.
    <br>At the end of the day, this thing was known everywhere
    <br>that my husband and I were fighting because a particular girl that was fighting with me
    <br>from the same church that we were going to.
    <br>So now I said, what will I do.
    <br>I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I said, God, use these children and remember me for eighteen years of marriage.
    <br>Even if I have offended You, forgive me by using these children.
    <br>I would take this journey and go to The SCOAN so that I will receive my deliverance.
    <br>That was how my husband said he was coming here in December for holidays, and he left the house.
    <br>So now when he left, he sent somebody to bring money to us.
    <br>I told my son, what will I do with this money because I want to travel to The SCOAN.
    <br>My son said, Mummy, even if we don't eat, take this money and go.
    <br>Man of God will see you; just believe.
    <br>That's what I did. I purchased the ticket without him even knowing that I was coming here.
    <br>And I came. When I came here on Sunday,
    <br>glory be to God that the man of God located me
    <br>and he delivered me from that spirit of snake.
    <br>After delivering me, because he is a man of God and hears from Heaven,
    <br>he even knew in his spirit that I didn't even have any money, I had nowhere to go to.
    <br>He offered me a place to stay, he offered me food,
    <br>he took care of me, and I was accommodated. To God be the glory!
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>And then my husband was invited to come over to The SCOAN last week Sunday.
    <br>He too was here because he was called to come for reconciliation.
    <br>So now, I'm here, Man of God, to thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, for the help and the love you gave to me.
    <br>I have never been to any church where I was offered accommodation and food for free.
    <br>All that you hear is "give"; even if you don't have, they don't want to know.
    <br>But God used you to reconcile me with my husband, my family and children.
    <br>I want to thank you and thank God Almighty for using you to reconcile me.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>Now, since I have been delivered from that spirit of snake -
    <br>on Tuesday when I went back to the lodge to sleep,
    <br>the snake tried to come whilst I was sleeping.
    <br>It was asking me, "Why are you doing this to me?
    <br>Why did you come to The SCOAN for them to deliver you?"
    <br>I tried to ask, "Who is that? Who is talking?"
    <br>And when I woke up, the snake disappeared; I didn't see it anymore.
    <br>Now I am delivered; I am free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>And ever since my deliverance, I can really hug my husband;
    <br>we can now talk like husband and wife;
    <br>we can now phone our children together, there is peace.
    <br>He keeps telling me that he loves me;
    <br>that we need to plan how to live together with the children in peace.
    <br>There is peace and joy.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ndubuisi Chika Nwokoye.
    <br>I am from Oka, Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am very happy to stand before the people of God in this great arena of liberty.
    <br>The beautiful lady standing by my side is my lovely wife.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>In June it will be 13 years that we've been married.
    <br>At first, it was love.
    <br>After five years, it became a war.
    <br>Because, you know where I come from, we believe in one thing -
    <br>that a woman never rules a man.
    <br>And when we go into marriage, we don't go in for love.
    <br>We go into marriage - I am an Igbo man - we go into marriage for children.
    <br>Even when the woman gives birth to only females and not males, it brings more war.
    <br>We don't look at the woman as the first thing.
    <br>We look at what she is producing for us because it is  like employment.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>If a woman does not give birth to a child, that is another big war.
    <br>Another thing is that the woman must be under us - under our authority.
    <br>She mustn't have a choice of her own.
    <br>She must be obedient, respect us - when we are wrong or right.
    <br>Because, as far as I know, in Igbo land, the chief can never be wrong.
    <br>If a woman goes out, it is a problem for the woman. But if a man goes out, he is still right
    <br>because he can have 2 or 3 wifes, according to the tradition of Igbo land.
    <br>But it came to a time - you can be possessed but you won't know that you are possessed.
    <br>If someone came to tell me before my deliverance that I was possessed, I would tell the person, "Get out!"
    <br>Because everthing I was doing was very right in my view,
    <br>never knowing that I was possessed.
    <br>This war between my wife and I - it came to a time when I could not take it anymore.
    <br>I said to myself, I have gone everywhere; I have gone to so many churches,
    <br>deliverance upon deliverance, but this woman is still the same.
    <br>I made the decision to take another wife
    <br>because in my place, we believe that if you want to quench a fire
    <br>of a woman in the house, marry another woman on top of her.
    <br>Then the war will leave you and be between her and the other lady that you are bringing in.
    <br>So, I told my wife that I was going to Nigeria for holiday, to visit my friends and family
    <br>but she didn't know that I was coming to Nigeria to look for a new wife.
    <br>As I was searching for this new wife in Nigeria,
    <br>I never knew that this woman that I had left in South Africa had landed at The SCOAN.
    <br>As I was here in Nigeria, in my hometown Oka, looking around, enjoying myself,
    <br>moving about as someone who is celebrating New Year and Christmas together,
    <br>looking for a new wife,
    <br>all the women I was seeing, I was comparing them with my wife,
    <br>I never saw someone as beautiful as her. I wanted to beat her with another beautiful one.
    <br>So, as time was going on, it happened on Sunday that I phoned my home in South Africa.
    <br>I asked my children, "Where is my wife?" They said that they didn't know her whereabouts.
    <br>In the evening I called back again. I asked, "Is she back?" They said, "No".
    <br>I asked, "What is happening?"
    <br>On Sunday, people started calling me that they saw my wife on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was shocked because I never knew about it.
    <br>I asked, "What happened?"
    <br>They said that they saw her.
    <br>Okay. I kept quiet.
    <br>On Monday, a call came from The SCOAN that they needed to see me here.
    <br>They said that the man of God wanted to see me.
    <br>That is a call I cannot say no to.
    <br>The way I was angry, I even said that I didn't want her forever.
    <br>Before I was hiding, then I was telling her openly, "No more!
    <br>Although you knew it before but now I'm telling you very openly that I don't want you forever".
    <br>She kept quiet; she didn't even answer.
    <br>If it were before, when I said something, she would answer with fire.
    <br>Okay. If it were the mother that called me, she knows I would not come.
    <br>Or her father or any of her relations.
    <br>But this was a call that touched my life.
    <br>The man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, is someone that
    <br>when I watch him on Emmanuel TV, my body is shaking.
    <br>So I couldn't say no.
    <br>I took my car, called my friends and said, "I'm going to The SCOAN on Saturday
    <br>because a call came from here that they needed me".
    <br>When I came here, I didn't want to see my wife's face.
    <br>I was so angry because in my mind I said,
    <br>"Whatever happens, I have taken the decision - I need a new wife".
    <br>So, I said, "Man of God, whatever you say, I will accept it because I know that you hear directly from God".
    <br>The man of God told me that this marriage is from God.
    <br>That calmed me down - number 1.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>Number 2 - that same Sunday evening, I went to the prayer line
    <br>where the man of God is delivering people.
    <br>When I was coming, I was myself.
    <br>Arriving there, immediately the man of God raised his hand,
    <br>I went back; I don't know what happened to me.
    <br>I fell under the anointing.
    <br>I said to myself, "Ah, am I myself?"
    <br>I wanted to stand up but there was no strength. I fell back again.
    <br>My head was as if it was divided into two.
    <br>This side is talking one thing; the other side is talking another thing.
    <br>So, I couldn't get myself very well.
    <br>After the deliverance, when I went to the place
    <br>where the man of God gave us to stay for free,
    <br>I told my wife, "Still now, I don't know what is happening to me!
    <br>My head is still divided. This one this side; this one talking another thing but I will see".
    <br>Then I fell asleep.
    <br>When I woke up in the morning, I looked at my wife.
    <br>She looked so young and beautiful.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>I said to myself, ""Wow! Is it a mistake that I should make?"
    <br>So this girl I came to look for in Nigeria is still the same one I left in South Africa
    <br>that came here beautiful like this.
    <br>I said to myself, "Now I know that I really need deliverance; I am possessed".
    <br>Because so many things I was doing before,
    <br>I see it was wrong - wrong after wrong.
    <br>I asked myself, "Was it me doing this?" I was shocked.
    <br>I said to my wife, "Please forgive me!
    <br>Whatever wrong I have done to you before, forgive me!
    <br>I was not using my real eye. I had eyes then but I could not see.
    <br>Now that I can see clearly, you are beautiful!"
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>From that day, every day she is looking new,
    <br>more than new, more than beautiful.
    <br>I said, "Ay!" Today I stand in this great arena to ask the people of God
    <br>to thank the man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, for me.
    <br>He really reconciled my wife and I.
    <br>I am very happy and I promise that I will love her more and more.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>My advice to people, married people, all over the world
    <br>that are having a similar problem to what I encountered before
    <br>is that never say no when you enter into marriage.
    <br>Think of the heart that you wanted to break.
    <br>It is really not your heart but someone's that came from her parents' house to be with you.
    <br>Remember what God said that the woman will leave her mother and father,
    <br>join with a man and they will become one.
    <br>Whatever you encounter, never say no.
    <br>If it is so much for you that you cannot carry,
    <br>know that there is a place - the arena of liberty - where your problem can be solved.
    <br>Try, make your way to The SCOAN1
    <br>When you arrive here, I know that the God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>that visited me and delivered me will surely do it for you.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Nwokoye - Deliverance / Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>My advice to the whole world and to married couples is that
    <br>we should always seek the face of God.
    <br>I know women would be saying that I don't know what I'm talking about.
    <br>But I went through so many pains; I've been there; I have done that.
    <br>Please, don't ever feel like leaving your home.
    <br>Just stay strong and help your husband. He might not know what he is doing
    <br>Be it you are a man and it is your wife that is misbehaving.
    <br>Be strong and believe in God.
    <br>Tell yourself that you will come together and find a solution.
    <br>And the advice I give is that the arena of liberty - The SCOAN -
    <br>whatever it will cost you, just land here and God will see you through.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Angel Nwokoye.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband, Mr Chika Ndubuisi Nwokoye.
    <br>We are here by the grace of God to testify for what God did in our lives,
    <br>concerning the reconciliation when I came to The SCOAN on January 15th.
    <br>I want to thank God because today, there is peace through the reconciliation;
    <br>there is peace and love between my husband and I.
    <br>Our children are happy, we are living happily
    <br>and I thank God and I thank Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua for allowing God to use him
    <br>to reconcile this marriage.
    <br>The situation was really terrible
    <br>but I thank God that I've been delivered
    <br>and now I'm fully happy in my marriage.
    <br>My name is Mr Ndubuisi Chika Nwokoye.
    <br>I'm from Oka, the capital of Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my lovely wife, Angel Nwokoye.
    <br>People of God, this is something I don't know how to explain.
    <br>It is something that is wonderful; something I have tried by all means to use my power.
    <br>I prayed to the Lord, fasted a lot but nothing worked. I became frustrated.
    <br>That is why I began to hate my wife the more
    <br>because when things were happening, I thought I could correct one or two,
    <br>but nothing was happening.
    <br>When I came here in January, I was invited by Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I came here - it was wonderful.
    <br>That touch of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua changed everything in my life;
    <br>changed everything in my family;
    <br>changed everything that I thought could not be done.
    <br>You know before, I didn't know my children much.
    <br>I always liked to stay out at night.
    <br>At day time, I would not come in.
    <br>Night time - that is when I loved to go out.
    <br>I spent my time in the bar, with friends and doing all sorts of rubbish,
    <br>not knowing that the real joy is my family.
    <br>That the real joy is to stay, to know my children and my wife.
    <br>After the touch of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua - wow!
    <br>It was something that I cannot explain.
    <br>I began to enjoy staying at home, studying my children and staying with my wife.
    <br>In fact, I was in marriage but I was not in love before.
    <br>But now, I have come back with love; my marriage has become sweet.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My life became sweet.
    <br>My marriage became sweet.
    <br>My children, everything around me became sweet.
    <br>In fact, another thing  - poverty that was following me disappeared.
    <br>Before, it was hand to mouth.
    <br>All the things I was bragging about was just a brag because no man paid.
    <br>But after the touch of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua, wonders started happening.
    <br>My father, Chika Nwokoye, 90 years old, passed away.
    <br>But you know in Igbo land, to bury someone is not an easy something.
    <br>Espcially an old man - a celebration of life.
    <br>But when I looked around, what God had given me after I visited The SCOAN,
    <br>I smiled because I was loaded.
    <br>Wow! To God be the glory!
    <br>I can see that our brother is full of joy.
    <br>My advice to people is that every man that is in marriage,
    <br>please know it that marriage is of God.
    <br>If you encounter what I have encountered, don't chase your wife away.
    <br>Don't go and take another wife.
    <br>Consult God and you will see that God is in The SCOAN.
    <br>God will do the same thing in your life that he has done for me.
    <br>I'm so grateful; I'm so happy.
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus!
    <br>Wow! To God be the glory! We thank God Almighty, and we also want to advise you
    <br>and encourage you as you rightly said, don't run from God but rather run to God
    <br>because He is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>Never a problem he cannot solve
    <br>because He has given that spirit of reconciliation to reconcile families,
    <br>to reconcile nations and to reconcile the whole world.
