    <br>Yes.
    <br>As a spirit of lust, what have you done to her marriage?
    <br>She will not have an affection for her husband.
    <br>She will not have an affection for her husband?

    <br>I make her frustrated.
    <br>You frustrate her?
    <br>How do you do it?
    <br>Disobedience.
    <br>I make her feel that she is not listening to her mother.
    <br>Why do you do that to her as little as she is?
    <br>I wanted to make her hate her mother.
    <br>To make her hate her mother?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Were you able to achieve that?
    <br>No.
    <br>Why was it difficult for you to achieve that?
    <br>It is because of this ministry.

    <br>It sets people free.
    <br>It sets people free?
    <br>Yes, from darkness.

    <br>No, we hate people.
    <br>You hate people being set free from darkness?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That means that you belong to the kingdom of darkness?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>Who is she to you?
    <br>My mummy.
    <br>She said that you are her mom.
    <br>No.
    <br>I am not her mum.
    <br>OK, tell her.
    <br>You are my mummy.
    <br>No, I have nothing to do with her.
    <br>Are you sure she is your mum?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Right now, it's time to leave this body.
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus, you demon!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come out of her, you spirit of lust!

    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You are delivered.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>Are you sure?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Who is this?
    <br>This is my daughter.
    <br>Are you sure this is your daughter?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Earlier you said that you do not know her.
    <br>I gave birth to her.
    <br>You gave birth to her?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But you denied her just now.
    <br>No. I will never deny her.
    <br>You will never deny her and this is your daughter?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You said you were the spirit of lust living inside her.
    <br>No, I cannot be a spirit.
    <br>So that very demon that was tormenting you is out. You are free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Are you happy now that your mum says that you are her daughter?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Are you happy?
    <br>Give her a hug.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you Jesus!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Indeed, God is with us.
    <br>My name is Carolien Coetzee, I am 39 years old, I am from Cape Town, South Africa.
    <br>The man standing next to me is my husband Emil Coetzee.
    <br>The reason we came to The SCOAN in Lagos is to share our wonderful testimony
    <br>of what God has done for us in our lives.
    <br>If it was not for this ministry, the living church we have seen,
    <br>we would not be here today to say "Jesus is Lord".
    <br>I received my deliverance from the spirit of abuse, which was constantly tormenting me for almost 29 years.
    <br>I heard constant voices in my head, which I all this years thought were me.
    <br>I always felt rejected, not good enough, always striving, being busy, never being able to settle down.
    <br>While doing things at home like cooking, I would be worrying about tomorrow or other things.
    <br>I would always be struggling and be frustrated.
    <br>Obviously, the atmosphere in the house was not good.
    <br>Even when I looked at other women, I would always feel not beautiful, not good enough,
    <br>and I would always try to hide myself.
    <br>We then decided to come for the candlelight service in 2012.
    <br>I wanted to bring my daughter, just to experience the blessing here.
    <br>I thank God because as wise man Daniel laid his hands on me, the spirit manifested -
    <br>the spirit of lust who was from the ocean.
    <br>I really didn't have any affection for my husband.
    <br>We would quarrel and fight constantly, never settling issues, just moving along,
    <br>hoping that it would be better tomorrow, or it would be settled by itself.
    <br>I just give glory to God that I brought my daughter, because if I hadn't brought her,
    <br>God could not have revealed the plan of the enemy to destroy our relationship.
    <br>Little did I know that the plan that the enemy had was for her to hate me.
    <br>Yes, I can confirm that it was a constant struggle with her in the house.
    <br>I would hear that voice telling me that she is disobedient. I felt frustrated with her.
    <br>I felt that she was not giving her best.
    <br>I can just confirm that since the deliverance we have such a nice relationship.
    <br>I just say, "Thank You, Jesus, for what You have done, for using this ministry, for using the wise men,
    <br>for using the man of God, to give us an opportunity to come here and receive our deliverance,
    <br>so that we can be free Christians, and really walk as born-again".
    <br>Can you now explain to us -
    <br>how did that affect your relationship with your husband and your daughter?
    <br>Well, the relationship with my husband - I had no affection for my husband.
    <br>If he wanted to meet as husband and wife, I would constantly look for an excuse.
    <br>I didn't have that affection.
    <br>And I knew it was not normal but it was like I could not help myself.
    <br>It is just the spirit controlling you.
    <br>You know it is not normal but you still feel it yourself.
    <br>With my daughter - you could see that she was still little then.
    <br>I would put out a set of clothes and then we would fight even over the clothes she must wear.
    <br>It was this spirit telling me that she is disobedient, she is not listening to you.
    <br>That made me to feel really frustrated with her.
    <br>But now after the deliverance, what are the differences that you have seen?
    <br>Glory be to Jesus!
    <br>It is a totally different relationship I have with my daughter now.
    <br>I picked her up from school.
    <br>Out of her own, she said, "Mummy, you are the best mummy in the world".
    <br>And I know if it was not for that deliverance, it would not have been possible.
    <br>We spend time together. We really have a good relationship.
    <br>And with my husband - I see him now with affection which he is glad of.
    <br>We are really growing stronger and stronger every day, and I just thank the Lord for that.
    <br>She said that they wouldn't be standing here together today if not for that deliverance.
    <br>Now, we would like to listen to the husband
    <br>and find out his own experience and his testimony of the deliverance.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Emil Coetzee. I am from Cape Town, South Africa.
    <br>My house used to be a very sensitive place -
    <br>a place where I used to stand on a tray of eggs,
    <br>a place of quarrel between me and my wife.
    <br>We would have quarrels, and in a time we would settle, but it would be a continuous situation.
    <br>I even noticed that the relationship between my wife and our daughter...
    <br>I actually spoke to her, saying, "You should take care of the way you are treating your daughter
    <br>because she might just start drifting apart". So I really noticed that.
    <br>Can you now share with us - what are the differences that you've seen
    <br>in your marriage and in your family since the deliverance?
    <br>We thank God.
    <br>After a day of work, I actually look forward to get home
    <br>There is peace in my house. The relationships are good.
    <br>The relationship between my daughter and my wife is wonderful.
    <br>The relationship between us: We are free, we can speak,
    <br>we can quarrel and make up, we can discuss things.
    <br>It's just the way a marriage should be.
    <br>And now after receiving this wonderful miracle
    <br>and seeing the change in your marriage and in your family,
    <br>what is your advice to those who are facing the same situation that you were facing?
    <br>I can honestly say, there are many living churches, but for us - if it wasn't for this ministry,
    <br>I do not know where our lives would have been.
    <br>So I can just encourage people to get linked up, watch Emmanuel TV, follow the Facebook page,
    <br>get the podcasts, try to get to The SCOAN, get to one of the branches, whatever you can do.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Exactly - distance is not a barrier for Jesus Christ to touch you.
    <br>Can you please give us your advice after receiving your deliverance?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My advice to everyone out there is that you should open your heart to God's Word,
    <br>to His Spirit, and to His faith.
    <br>God can take you from where you are now to where He wants you to be.
    <br>Just be open.
    <br>We just advise you after your deliverance that you should draw closer to Jesus Christ,
    <br>not draw back in the situation that you face,
    <br>and that you should make God's Word the standard for you life,
    <br>and for your marriage, and train your child up in the way of the Lord, in Jesus' Name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
