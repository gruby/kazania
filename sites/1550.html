    <br>Brain dead coma patient wakes up after TB Joshua's prayer in Nazareth!!!
    <br>Emmanuel! My name is Mrs Elvira Wi from Korea.
    <br>I have an incredible testimony to share to the glory of God!
    <br>I travelled from Korea to attend the Nazareth Meeting with TB Joshua.
    <br>I took with me the photograph of a friend named Sergey Pak who had been in a coma for 2 weeks.
    <br>He fell from a high roof while working for a company and suffered fractures all over his body.
    <br>After the fall, he was rushed to the hospital and declared clinically dead for one hour.
    <br>However, his relatives did not agree with the verdict of death and continued to proclaim life and pray.
    <br>Miraculously, he came to life but did not come to his senses. He was in a coma.
    <br>The doctors said that he would be like a 'vegetable' because his brain was for so long without oxygen.
    <br>They said he would be on a life support machine for the rest of his life...
    <br>So, in Nazareth, when I got into the prayer line with a photograph of Sergey, TB Joshua laid his hands on me.
    <br>At that moment, Sergey's father - Pastor Igor Pak from Kazakhstan - was watching the live service on Emmanuel TV!
    <br>When TB Joshua prayed for me, the sick son's father felt a force touch his own head!
    <br>The next day, Sergey regained consciousness!!!
    <br>Ever since, he has begun a remarkable road to recovery!
    <br>By God's grace, he can now speak freely and communicate with those around him!
    <br>I want to thank all those who prayed for me.
    <br>I also want to thank T.B. Joshua for praying for me in Nazareth!
    <br>All the doctors are shocked at this miraculous recovery!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!!!
    <br>Do you have a testimony?
    <br>Submit your testimony now!
