    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>we want to be like Jesus.
    <br>We want to be like Jesus in our heart.
    <br>We pray for right focus, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Whatever is disturbing you right now, our heart is always going up and down
    <br>you think about this and think about that - leave it for God.
    <br>We pray for right focus, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right focus, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Begin to receive a hearing heart.
    <br>A hearing heart.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>I separate you from familiar spirits.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,  begin to confess every loophole,
    <br>every area the familiar spirits are using to attack you.
    <br>It is using your weakness to attack you.
    <br>It is using your weakness to get to you.
    <br>Begin to confess those weaknesses. Begin to confess them...
    <br>Every area familiar spirits, satanic spirits are using to get to you, to attack you -
    <br>confess them right now before we sack them.
    <br>It is time to sack them!
    <br>It is time to give them a quit notice; it is the hour to give them a quit notice.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, begin to confess those weaknesses.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Right now, have the quit notice and begin to serve it to satan,
    <br>serve demons the quit notice.
    <br>Here is the quit notice!
    <br>This is notice!
    <br>Right now, out of my life; out of my temple.
    <br>Give them a quit notice right now; serve it to them!
    <br>Quit! This is a quit notice I'm serving you right now!
    <br>I'm giving you a quit notice to leave my life, business, finances
    <br>to leave my career, family, marriage, country!
    <br>to leave my life. This is quit notice, this is notice!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Viewers all over  the world,
    <br>yes, I know the challenges you have; God knows better.
    <br>Whatever challenges in your health, be it your bones, kidneys, liver, blood
    <br>are you unable to walk or are you on sickbed?
    <br>Whatever challenges, sickness is sickness.
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Dry bones shall rise again.
    <br>Whatever and wherever the sickness, disease is in your body,
    <br>ignorantly you may not know,
    <br>I say, be removed in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When Jesus says, "Be removed", who can say no?
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The name all names bow to -
    <br>all knees shall bow, all tongues shall confess.
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>At the name of Jesus, at the command of Jesus, I remove that sickness!
    <br>It is well
    <br>It is well with your soul, blood, kidney, muscles, liver!
    <br>It is well!
    <br>Rejoice!
