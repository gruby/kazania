  <p>    
    <br>There is a woman here.
    <br>There is a spirit of suicide.
    <br>Anytime this spirit comes upon you, you begin to look for knife, cutlery.
    <br>Anywhere you could find it, you would begin to look.
    <br>Dark in complexion.
    <br>Many times you would find a knife,
    <br>You want to kill yourself.
    <br>This is the spirit of suicide.
    <br>Please, come out.
    <br>Any time this spirit comes upon you....
    <br>They want to use you to commit murder
    <br>so that you could be sentenced to life imprisonment.
    <br>What a beautiful woman, come out.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The woman comes forward to confirm the prophecy of the man of God
    <br>concerning the spirit of suicide.
    <br>There is a spirit in you and when the spirit comes upon you,
    <br>you begin to look for knife, cutlery.
    <br>It is true, sir.
    <br>You want to commit suicide,
    <br>There was a time you ran to the kitchen and you carried a knife.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>And you were running, you wanted to kill, you wanted to slaughter yourself.
    <br>Yes, sir, it is true. It was like a snake was running around in my head.
    <br>Look at her, what a beautiful woman.
    <br>Satan just wants to destroy this woman.
    <br>There are two things satan wants to do in your life.
    <br>It is either you kill yourself or kill somebody
    <br>so that they can sentence you to life imprisonment
    <br>or you kill yourself, they don't want you in circulation.
    <br>Yes, sir. It is true, sir.
    <br>Please deliver me, sir.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>That is the woman undergoing deliverance.
    <br>The man of God gave a prophetic message.
    <br>Any time the spirit comes upon her, she will be looking for cutlery.
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>...to kill herself or anybody around her.
    <br>That there are two things that he wants to happen to her:
    <br>either she kills herself because they don't want her in circulation
    <br>or she kills someone around.
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Stand up and come here!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>We are commanding the spirit anywhere it is hiding; it's going and coming out.
    <br>But it should come now.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>You see the face - that is what normally happens when she carries a knife.
    <br>Can you see the face has changed?
    <br>This is exactly what happens.
    <br>Any time she carries a knife, this is the face she bears.
    <br>Can you see - when she is delivered, the face will come down to normal.
    <br>Out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, I command that spirit, out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>He's gone.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am free! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Do you see - the face is coming back now.
    <br>Now, she is free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Blessing.
    <br>I am from Abuja, Nigeria.
    <br>I was in the church last week when the man of God prophesied to me
    <br>that I have a spirit of suicide which is very true.
    <br>Each time I was at home - I really want to thank God.
    <br>I used to feel a movement like that of a snake all over my body
    <br>I couldn't sleep at night; I would be very aggressive.
    <br>I went to the extent of carrying a knife to try and kill myself.
    <br>My parents and husband would hold me.
    <br>I hated everyone around me, including my children.
    <br>In the night, I couldn't sleep
    <br>and my whole body would get so hot; it felt like I was burning.
    <br>I couldn't sleep at night but when the Prophet prayed for me,
    <br>he delivered me and now, I am free; I sleep like a baby now.
    <br>I no longer experience the snake-like movements in my body.
    <br>I give God all the glory, I give Him all the adoration.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>I am okay, I no longer have the spirit of suicide.
    <br>In fact, I am very, very okay.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>I want to advise people that if you are having a spirit of suicide,
    <br>come to The SCOAN and don't be shy about it.
    <br>Put your hope in God and God will surely deliver you.
