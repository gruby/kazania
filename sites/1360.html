    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>You may be seated; thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is so much blessing around.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm here to receive my own portion.
    <br>You know, what is good needs prayer, what is little needs prayer
    <br>and what is bad also needs prayer.
    <br>So I'm here to receive my own portion.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>You are what you do, not what you say.
    <br>You are saying, "Jesus is Lord, Jesus is this" during time of confession.
    <br>But the Bible says, you are what you do, not what you say.
    <br>This shows you have to match your action with your words
    <br>because knowing facts about Jesus does not change our relationship with Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Match your action with your words".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Match your action with your words.]
    <br>So all what you have been confessing, "Jesus is my Lord,
    <br>I will forgive my neighbour, I will do this, I will do that" -
    <br>you have to match it with your action.
    <br>When you get home, right from here, you begin to prepare your way.
    <br>When you know there is anything you have been doing in the past, before now,
    <br>it is time now to change.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>You are what you do, not what you say.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[You are what you do, not what you say.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[You are what you do, not what you say.]
    <br>So please, it is very important.
    <br>What are you taking home to maintain your holiness?
    <br>Right now, we are ex-losers.
    <br>Right now, you are an ex-loser.
    <br>Say, right now, I'm an ex-loser!
    <br>What are you taking home to maintain your life - Christ's life of holiness?
    <br>Because you have to maintain what you have received now.
    <br>You know that immediately you leave here, it is a different thing.
    <br>You meet a lot of friends - those who divide, those who subtract.
    <br>A lot of friends.
    <br>You cannot succeed alone; you need good people.
    <br>What are you taking home to maintain what you have received?
    <br>Just think about this.
    <br>Maintenance is very important.
    <br>Ask yourself, "What am I taking home?
    <br>All what I have been seeing - to maintain the life I have received today".
    <br>You have received a new life - life without affliction,
    <br>a new life - life without failure,
    <br>a new life - life without rejection,
    <br>a new life - life without hatred,
    <br>a new life - life without tribulation.
    <br>Ask yourself, "What am I taking home to maintain this life?"
    <br>That is the question now.
    <br>I'm seeing new people, a new beginning - everyone.
    <br>But the question remains:
    <br>How will you maintain this life?
    <br>You have been very quiet.
    <br>You know the kind of life we live.
    <br>You have friends over there, people out there.
    <br>So this is what we should be thinking about, right now.
    <br>The Bible makes us to understand about genuine humility.
    <br>Before honour is humility.
    <br>We don't have enough time to talk about humility.
    <br>Humility is not to put on rags, it is not "Good Morning, sir",
    <br>beginning to greet everyone - this is what we display. No!
    <br>Before honour is humility.
    <br>Unless we are humble, we will not bow to Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Unless you are humble, you will not bow to Jesus".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Unless you are humble, you will not bow to Jesus.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Unless you are humble, you will not bow to Jesus.]
    <br>Unless you are humble, you will not bow to Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say, "Ah, I'm very humble, that is why I'm in the church".
    <br>That is not the kind of humility we are talking about.
    <br>Humility will not do, hear or say without question but will ask Jesus
    <br>because Jesus is all the world to us.
    <br>Jesus is all the world to us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Jesus is all the world to me".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus is all the world to me.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Jesus is all the world to me.]
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Jesus is all the world to me.]
    <br>That means, you have no other life.
    <br>You want to sit down, you ask Jesus, "How will I sit down?"
    <br>You want to talk, you ask Jesus, "Will I talk?"
    <br>You want to look, you ask Jesus, "Will I look? Will I greet?"
    <br>You want to dress up, you ask Jesus,
    <br>meaning you know how much you need Him.
    <br>He is all the world to me - my life, my joy, my all!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My life, my joy, my all!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[My life, my joy, my all!]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[My life, my joy, my all!]
    <br>Jesus is all the world to me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You want to look - Jesus!
    <br>You want to sit - Jesus!
    <br>You want to greet, before you greet - Jesus!
    <br>You want to comb your hair - Jesus!
    <br>You want to eat - Jesus!
    <br>To maintain the life you have received today,
    <br>this is the procedure - Jesus must be all the world to you.
    <br>He is our strength from day to day.
    <br>He is my strength from day to day.
    <br>Say to your neighbour.
    <br>[He is my strength from day to day.]
    <br>Jesus is my strength from day to day.
    <br>Look, I want to move - Jesus!
    <br>Another leg - Jesus!
    <br>Back again - Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>Jesus is my strength from day to day; you don't have any other strength.
    <br>This means, the life you are living is not yours.
    <br>Oh how I love Jesus
    <br>Because He went for me
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>He went for you.
    <br>What manner of man is Jesus?
    <br>To maintain the life you have received now - this is a new beginning -
    <br>Jesus must be your strength from day to day.
    <br>Jesus must be your strength to maintain what you have received now.
    <br>Are you thinking about that?
    <br>For you to know that you have not been maintaining that life.
    <br>You can sit on your own - you just sit down, without relying on Him.
    <br>You just talk, you say, "Come here!"
    <br>Before you say that, "Jesus, come here!", He will guide you.
    <br>Because it is an independent mind.
    <br>I want to pray with you now.
    <br>Remember, you have received it all.
    <br>I am only just coming here to encourage you
    <br>and to make sure no one leaves here without being transformed.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Regardless of what you are going through - take note of that.
    <br>Regardless of what you are going through.
    <br>Say, "Regardless of what I am going through in the natural".
    <br>You can be having a headache now.
    <br>But above, over there, the headache is gone.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Take note of that. I want you to understand it before I offer my prayer to you.
    <br>You must know this.
    <br>Regardless of what you are going through in the natural.
    <br>It means, you can be in trouble now.
    <br>Not in the natural but over there, above, there is no trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>"Ah, I don't know why this is happening to me."
    <br>But you don't know whether what is happening to you is still happening to you in the spirit.
    <br>If what is happening to you now is not happening to you in the spirit,
    <br>definitely, you are blaspheming.
    <br>Someone is working out the answer -
    <br>what God is working out for you now.
    <br>Regardless of what you are going through in the natural -
    <br>it may be painful in the natural, it may be rough in the natural -
    <br>Jesus says, "The way out for you has come!"
    <br>Are you taking my word?
    <br>Jesus says, "The way out for you has come!"
    <br>By the time you leave here - you will leave here today, tomorrow or any other day -
    <br>you will say, "Yes"; you will send me an email, "You have said it T.B. Joshua".
    <br>Why can't you begin to rejoice?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You have been praying to play football.
    <br>But you have not played football.
    <br>But we are telling you, "This is the outcome of the game";
    <br>that you are a winner.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>The way out for you...
    <br>[...has come.]
    <br>I want you to finish the word.
    <br>[The way out for me has come.]
    <br>The way out for your business has come!
    <br>The way out for your health has come!
    <br>The way out for your marriage, career has come!
    <br>What else, if I'm telling you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>If you are praying to God, "Lord, please, this man promised to borrow me millions of dollars",
    <br>and you prayed that the Lord should touch his heart and you have been praying since morning,
    <br>will the man come inside the church to give you the loan?
    <br>And I'm telling you now that when you get home, the man is waiting to give you a loan.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>So this is just the picture of what I'm painting.
    <br>Concerning your health, that pain - you feel that pain.
    <br>You are telling me something in the natural and I'm telling you something in the spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching you!
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching your finances!
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching your finances, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I am not coming here to pray; I am here to prophesy.
    <br>What I have seen in the spirit is what I am telling you now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be patient and wait for the physical manifestation now!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Take note of 'now'! I'm not saying just be patient; wait for the physical manifestation now!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>This year, 1st January, the Lord said, "Go to the mountain. Meet me somewhere".
    <br>I said, "Which mountain?"
    <br>The Lord said, "A quiet place.
    <br>A place where when I'm praying, I will not be able to close my eyes because of fear.
    <br>Tiger can come this way, lion may come this way,
    <br>python may come this way. Inside the thick forest".
    <br>Where I will not be able to close my eyes.
    <br>You yourself - it is your idea and culture that when you want to pray...
    <br>If I carry you to where I went to last January - ah!
    <br>Even you would not want to pray louder because you don't know what is coming out.
    <br>When I got there, the second day, the Lord said to me, "This year is very fearful".
    <br>"This year is a very fearful year?"
    <br>"I'm bringing you here to pray for your nation and for the whole world at large and for your people."
    <br>"How will I offer the prayer?"
    <br>"Stay here for three days. I will give you a word to say."
    <br>I am just telling you what is in the spirit.
    <br>If care is not taken - proper care - it may hang for years.
    <br>Do you know that many are here that are not supposed to be a follower,
    <br>are supposed to be a leader and their leadership has been released in the spirit
    <br>but yet, they are still a follower.
    <br>Something can be hung for many years in the spirit
    <br>which is no longer in the hands of God.
    <br>God will release - "Ok, this thing is for Mr T.B. Joshua."
    <br>And it will continue rolling and rolling in the spirit there.
    <br>And yet, for years, T.B. Joshua has not yet received it.
    <br>And you will continue to pray to God, "God, give me bread, give me bread",
    <br>whereas that bread has been released over there.
    <br>But the bread you were to have received instantly is just there
    <br>because what you do is different from what you say.
    <br>So the thing will just be there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Sometimes, when I see people on the street and I look at them,
    <br>"This man is not supposed to be on the street.
    <br>He is supposed to be in the palace.
    <br>Ah, this man is supposed to be in the palace but he is on the street".
    <br>Sometimes I see people lamenting, crying
    <br>whereas when I look at the person that is crying and lamenting,
    <br>this is a crown; somebody who is supposed to wear a crown.
    <br>One of the best men in the world is now on the street - one of worst men in the world.
    <br>On the last day, you will now find out, "This is the life I lived. This is the life God designed for me".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am what I do, not what I say".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I am what I do, not what I say.]
    <br>I am what I do, not what I say.
    <br>Match your actions with your words.
    <br>That is why when we say, "In Jesus' name", we are talking to the air.
    <br>If you are what you say, anytime you say, "In Jesus' name",
    <br>Jesus will come to the scene.
    <br>But many times you say, "In Jesus' name", Jesus does not come to the scene
    <br>because you are what you do
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>Knowing facts about Jesus does not change your relationship with Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Knowing facts about Jesus does not change my relationship with Jesus".
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching you - touching your life, touching your career.
    <br>Somebody touched me
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>While I was praying
    <br>Praying to my Father
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>Somebody touched me
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>While I was praying
    <br>Praying to my Father
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>It must be Jesus
    <br>Jesus Christ touched my soul
    <br>While I was praying
    <br>Praying to my Father
    <br>Jesus Christ touched my soul
    <br>I can see God's healing touching you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I am telling you what I am seeing in the spirit.
    <br>Allow it to happen.
    <br>I can see God's healing touching your life!
    <br>Allow it to happen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be patient and wait for the physical manifestation now, in the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Recount again.
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching your life.
    <br>I recount again.
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching your business.
    <br>I recount again.
    <br>I can see God's deliverance touching your marriage, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Say to yourself, "The way out for me has come!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[The way out for me has come!]
    <br>The way out for your career has come!
    <br>The way out for my career has come!
    <br>The way out for my business has come!
    <br>The way out for my good health has come!
    <br>The way out for my marriage has come, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>This is my message to you.
    <br>You should allow it to happen.
    <br>You have a role to play to allow it to happen.
    <br>You should allow it to happen.
    <br>Don't forget.
    <br>Don't harbour unforgiving spirit; don't harbour grudges.
    <br>Holding offence grieves the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Lift up your voice and let us pray for your nation.
    <br>Whatever you have as a contact, contact point, let us pray for your nation.
    <br>God's intervention!
    <br>God's intervention, in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Let us pray for nations that are not at peace because of war, crises.
    <br>Wherever that nation is - all over the world - send your prayer of peace.
    <br>Lift up your voice and pray.
    <br>Ask God to rain the rain of peace, rain of harmony on nations.
    <br>Wherever - East, South, North continent, South Continent.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let us pray for your journey.
    <br>Your journey of righteousness is not yet over.
    <br>You need to live the rest of your life to maintain your holiness.
    <br>Jesus will come like a thief in the night - no one knows when and how.
    <br>Therefore, you have to be alert, be conscious of what you do and what you say.
    <br>"Ah, am I saying what God wants me to say?"
    <br>"Am I doing what God wants me to do?"
    <br>Don't go where Jesus is not invited.
    <br>Be conscious of what you do, what you say.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>Ask God to strengthen you.
    <br>Ask for the grace of God to cover to you, His strength from day to day,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>Right now, I pray you become God's channel from today -
    <br>a channel of light where there is darkness,
    <br>a channel of love where there is hate,
    <br>a channel of faithfulness where there is unfaithfulness,
    <br>a channel of obedience where there is disobedience,
    <br>a channel of humility where there is pride, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
