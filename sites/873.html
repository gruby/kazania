  <p>    
    <br>During the Monday service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is ministering prayer and deliverance
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The name above all names is power and fire
    <br>which causes satan and his agents to tremble and flee.
    <br>As the man of God prays for this man, demons within him manifest violently.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Why are you disturbing me?
    <br>He was donated to me by his great grandfather.
    <br>When he was seven days old, I wanted to take him; they dedicated him to me.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Idol from the father's house.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>I have used him in so many ways.
    <br>Explain!
    <br>He's meant to serve me!
    <br>No career, he has no future.
    <br>He has a heart of helping, but I can't allow him.
    <br>I have destroyed him in so many ways.
    <br>I have destroyed him in giving him so many sicknesses - cancer!
    <br>Every evil thing you can think of - I have made him to do.
    <br>He womanises.
    <br>I have destroyed his family; his family is nothing to write home about - all of them.
    <br>I took the mother. I took his father. I gave his daughter cancer.
    <br>I gave him cancer
    <br>Even his first son is not even talking for five years now.
    <br>- Who caused it?
    <br>- I!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Idol from his father's house.
    <br>How did you enter this body?
    <br>He was dedicated to me when he was seven days old.
    <br>Satan and his agents are powerless in the face of God's might and the man is delivered in seconds.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>People of God - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Mr. Prince Obaerechi.
    <br>The lady beside me is my wife.
    <br>It all started like this:
    <br>When I was 10 -12 years old, I noticed something unusual happening,
    <br>but those were things that I could not be able to control on my own.
    <br>Sometimes I went against my wish to do them,
    <br>but after doing those things, I would feel so guilty for doing them
    <br>but tomorrow, I would still do them again.
    <br>Things like...
    <br>At the age 10-12 years, I had a group of friends living the same kind of life, in the same neighbourhood
    <br>- in terms of stealing little things from people in the community.
    <br>It started by stealing money from my mother's handbag and using it.
    <br>At the end of the day, when asked, I would deny stealing it.
    <br>It went on like that for so many years.
    <br>When I was growing up, I noticed that something was wrong,
    <br>but I couldn't "fish out" what really was happening.
    <br>In 2006 I lost my mother.
    <br>After the burial, my mum's sister called a family meeting,
    <br>saying that there was something that they wanted to tell me.
    <br>I asked what it was.
    <br>They told me that when I was born,
    <br>from the first day I was delivered here on earth, I cried continually for 7 days.
    <br>My mother had no option but to take me to her father, who happened to be a very strong native doctor.
    <br>He never wore anything on his feet until when he died.
    <br>Everything in his compound was a shrine - he was as strong as that.
    <br>Nevertheless, he wasn't able to find a solution, so he went to another bigger witch doctor.
    <br>They consulted the witch doctor and he said that he was the one who came back as an incarnation,
    <br>that he wasn't supposed to be alive, that he was supposed to die before he came back.
    <br>But there was nothing the man could done.
    <br>They asked what they could do - he said that either they leave me to die,
    <br>or they go and buy things mentioned to them.
    <br>They were told to go to three junctions and perform some sacrifices, by 12 am.
    <br>After the sacrifice, the man would die for me to live.
    <br>It was a very big problem in the house.
    <br>They went back home.
    <br>The father of my mother had so many wives but he loved my mum as his first daughter.
    <br>He never wanted to disappoint my mum.
    <br>One day he called a meeting and said that he is going to do that sacrifice.
    <br>They asked him what would happen after the sacrifice.
    <br>He told them that they should keep me behind; when I grow up, I would continue where he stopped.
    <br>So, they went and purchased the items mentioned to them by the "bigger" witch doctor they went to.
    <br>By 12 am, the sacrifice was conducted.
    <br>After a few days, the man died.
    <br>That is how I stopped crying.
    <br>The story did not make sense to me;
    <br>I asked, why was the story coming then?
    <br>Why didn't it come before when my mother was alive?
    <br>The woman told me that she was the only woman who was living with my mum at that time.
    <br>She knew everything that happened.
    <br>But later the woman repented; she was the deaconess in the Assembly of God church.
    <br>My mum also repented.
    <br>They ignored the idol.
    <br>I never knew that all these years, the idol was living in me and working on me.
    <br>I was growing up and as the story didn't mean anything to me,
    <br>I started hanging out with my old friends.
    <br>Some of those friends became mature, having their own gangs.
    <br>Sometimes they would call me and we would go to people's houses and burgle them,
    <br>and take them away; sometimes we took money from them.
    <br>One strange thing always happened.
    <br>If I kept a glass cup on the desk, looking and be imagining that that glass cup would fall down and break,
    <br>I would be imagining for 4 or 5 minutes, then you would see that glass cup fall down and break.
    <br>If anybody offended me, they must have a big problem, leading to accident, or...
    <br>You must get yourself in a very big problem.
    <br>I was very proud of these things.
    <br>During those days, I made a lot of money.
    <br>I was using big cars, I made money; the money was coming.
    <br>You made us to understand that it was immediately after the death of your mother's father,
    <br>that this spirit fully possessed you.
    <br>- Is that correct?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- You were said to be his incarnation?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- And he was a notorious witch doctor during his time?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>It goes this way:
    <br>If you have a mission to carry out...
    <br>We thought that we were very smart and intelligent.
    <br>We would go to a witch doctor for a consultation.
    <br>During the consultation we called it to look into your side mirror,
    <br>and the witch doctor would tell you if you were going to make it or not.
    <br>He would tell you if you were going to succeed or not.
    <br>If there was a problem, you would have to fortify yourself ahead of the journey.
    <br>When we entered a house, I didn't need to ask where the money was; I would know where it was.
    <br>I would go straight where the money was and I would pick it.
    <br>That is how it was working for me.
    <br>In 2010, I noticed a problem - a growth that became bigger on a daily basis.
    <br>Another time I noticed another growth on my hip; this one was growing bigger than the first one.
    <br>So I kept it to myself; I didn't want to tell anybody.
    <br>I started going to hospitals.
    <br>There is no hospital in Nigeria that I did not go to.
    <br>I went to witch doctors.
    <br>I went to prayer houses.
    <br>I went to many churches - I don't want to call names - many churches.
    <br>I didn't want to die because all these years I thought I was being careful not to leave this earth.
    <br>But this sickness came then.
    <br>I would have gone to any place, no matter the cost.
    <br>There was a place, where I told the man, "If my health is going to cost a human head - tell me.
    <br>I am ready".
    <br>When the health issue stepped in, I started selling things because all my money was gone.
    <br>As there was no solution, I started selling my properties, cars, but at the end of the day nothing happened.
    <br>The person that bought my last car asked me, "Why can't you go to The Synagogue?"
    <br>I said, "Stop telling me that".
    <br>We used to read papers where they castigated the man of God and wrote a lot of rubbish about him.
    <br>We found it very comfortable to accept that there is no God.
    <br>Because if they could castigate someone like this, we could say, "There was no God".
    <br>Our conclusion was that all of them were the same.
    <br>I asked him, if he wanted to escape paying my money.
    <br>I wanted to treat myself, I had spent all my money; I sold my car...
    <br>He told me of somebody who had diabetes, who had come and received the Morning Water;
    <br>he was healed before he got home.
    <br>I told him to stop all those stories .
    <br>Then a friend of mine, who resides in Bayelsa State, was burying his mother;
    <br>I went to his mother's burial.
    <br>I then opened up to him, telling him what I was going through.
    <br>He is a member of this church.
    <br>He asked me if I had gone to The SCOAN.
    <br>I asked him to leave that conversation.
    <br>He tried preaching to me.
    <br>While the hearse was still going, he told me that I needed to go to The SCOAN.
    <br>I said I didn't want to go there, but he insisted.
    <br>At that time he provoked me and said, "Young man, if you want to know God, know God.
    <br>If you do not want to know God, leave the man alone.
    <br>This life is a battlefield and not a playground".
    <br>After he had said this, I was contemplating, "This world is a battlefield and not a playground.
    <br>If you want to know God, know God; 
    <br>if you don't want to know God, leave it".
    <br>At that time, these words kept ringing inside my mind.
    <br>When I tried to forget about it, it didn't go away easily.
    <br>It became like a little stream in my heart that refused to get dry.
    <br>At that time, there was a hotel I used to stay in.
    <br>At that time, I didn't go out "openly"; I always went to the rural areas and lodged there,
    <br>so that those who knew me would not see me.
    <br>So, I was staying in the hotel.
    <br>When all my hope was lost, I called one of my brothers, a friend.
    <br>I told him, "Young man, I've seen my death. I know that I am going to die
    <br>but before I die, look at how my burial must happen".
    <br>After that conversation with him, I began to scatter things in the room.
    <br>Somebody that was inside with me said that I should cool down, I would not die.
    <br>In the meantime, the television went off in my hotel room.
    <br>Somebody was trying to fix it, and I found Emmanuel TV.
    <br>When Emmanuel TV started showing...
    <br>I began to watch, I saw testimonies, healings and many things.
    <br>I wondered if this was the same man that they said things about.
    <br>Yet, I had not been convinced.
    <br>At the end of the day, I said to myself, "I went to herbal homes, prayer houses,  churches;
    <br>let me also go there."
    <br>I came only to try, like I tried in other places before.
    <br>When I got to the gate, a voice spoke to me to go back.
    <br>I went back to my hotel.
    <br>A friend advised me to go to India.
    <br>I went to India; this was my first time I went to India.
    <br>This is a medical visa.
    <br>I went and came back, I went to a hospital.
    <br>I spent three months, nothing happened.
    <br>I came back, I went back to another hospital in India,
    <br>I spent three months there and I came back.
    <br>I went back there again to "Action Cancer" hospital in New Delhi, India.
    <br>When I came back, they asked me to come back to SCOAN, since I had already gone to India.
    <br>The last time I was in India, the doctor asked me, "Who did I come with?"
    <br>I said, I hadn't come with anybody.
    <br>He left.
    <br>There was a young man I met in the flat while I was going; he had somebody there...
    <br>I told him, "Look where I'm going". I gave him my number.
    <br>After a few days, the person who received my number called me and they located me.
    <br>I told the man that since there was nobody here with me, I wanted him to assist me.
    <br>He took me to the "Action Cancer" hospital, where I was before.
    <br>When he examined the first medical check-up I had done at a different hospital
    <br>and the one they had already done,
    <br>the doctor shook his head, and he was a senior doctor.
    <br>He shook his head and asked me to go, and the man who was with me stayed with the doctor.
    <br>When the man came out, he was sweating.
    <br>I asked him what had happened.
    <br>He said that I needed someone to sign for me,
    <br>he couldn't do it because he didn't know me, and anything could happen.
    <br>He began to tell me the stories of people who came from Nigeria with cancer and died.
    <br>My mind was troubled.
    <br>I asked him to go back with me to the doctor.
    <br>The doctor told me that he was giving me only a 25% chance.
    <br>I had heard people being given a 50/50 chance, but in my case they gave only 25%.
    <br>I asked why only 25%. That meant 25% was already six feet under.
    <br>I was scared.
    <br>I came back to Nigeria, received the Morning Water and went home.
    <br>When I arrived back home, I was not satisfied.
    <br>I proceeded to submit my passport for another trip.
    <br>It takes four days to obtain a visa.
    <br>Before the elapse of the four days, my leg and my manhood had swollen up.
    <br>I couldn't wear shorts or trousers; I had to wear loose clothing.
    <br>If you pressed any part of my body, it would not return to its place.
    <br>The pain was unbearable - you wouldn't wish it to anybody.
    <br>When I got the Morning Water, I started to minister it and the pain went away;
    <br>a pain that previously made me to run naked at midnight...
    <br>So, the Morning Water...
    <br>Mr & Mrs Prince Obaerechi
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ; put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>You made us to understand that as a consequence of your involvement in acts of immorality,
    <br>based on the influence of this evil spirit that possessed you right from your childhood,
    <br>as a consequence of such acts, you were afflicted with pelvic cancer.
    <br>People have been hearing your story, how severe it was - they would like to see it pictorially.
    <br>Can you show us on the pictures what you are talking about, before you continue?
    <br>So that people can see how severe the case was,
    <br>for them to know that satan has nothing to offer, apart from affliction.
    <br>This is how it was, when I came the first time.
    <br>By the time I got to the gate, one spirit told me to go back;
    <br>I went back and travelled to India.
    <br>There, they gave me a 25% chance of surviving and I came back to Nigeria.
    <br>When I came back, this is the way it was - as you can see...
    <br>This is my flesh; the cancer had shrunk...
    <br>As you can see, it had affected my manhood; it was very large.
    <br>At that time, I couldn't wear shoes; I was smelling - the smell was very offensive
    <br>When I got the Morning Water, I started to minister it.
    <br>Before the visa came, I noticed that this unbearable pain had already gone.
    <br>I said, "The pain is gone - Ok".
    <br>Mr & Mrs Prince Obaerechi
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I said, "Ok, since this pain is gone, maybe something will happen".
    <br>On daily basis, I kept seeing changes.
    <br>The swelling leg started shrinking, so I was able to wear trousers.
    <br>I picked up the visa, but I didn't use the passport.
    <br>I said that something was happening.
    <br>When the leg finally come down to normal, I was very happy.
    <br>When the leg had come down, I began to wash the wound and administer the Morning Water on it.
    <br>In the hospital they told me that I shouldn't allow water to come on the wound.
    <br>But since I saw that my swollen leg was coming down, I was ministering the Morning Water on the wound.
    <br>The wound kept drying; I was very surprised, until it became like this.
    <br>OK, just a moment.
    <br>Before you finally saw the changes, you travelled to India twice, in search of solution?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- All to no avail?
    <br>Nothing happened.
    <br>And you also said you had been preparing for a third visit to India?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But after administering the Morning Water, when you started to see changes, you resigned to go to India?
    <br>Perfectly, sir.
    <br>And the same ministry where you believed, this man is not a true man of God,
    <br>is not from God, the same place you had your healing?
    <br>Perfectly.
    <br>Ok, right now, can you go to the noticeboard and show the present condition of your pelvic?
    <br>After ministering the Morning Water, the situation finally looks like this - I'm OK, no pain.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>You can see on the screen of your TV his present condition
    <br>as he is standing right now live and direct in our midst.
    <br>This is a clear proof that after the ministration of the Morning Water,
    <br>the pelvic cancer is completely gone.
    <br>And for the benefit of the viewers all over the world, could you just tap the place right now,
    <br>and tell us how you are feeling?
    <br>How are you feeling?
    <br>Nothing, I don't feel anything; it's already gone, as I'm talking to you...
    <br>Before, I couldn't even dare to...
    <br>You couldn't do like this before?
    <br>I couldn't even try it, or get close to that place.
    <br>Why you couldn't do it then?
    <br>Because of the pain.
    <br>The thing was very huge - it was a cancer of lymphoma, it can come out on any part of the body.
    <br>- But now you are completely free?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>The cancer is gone, and the pain is gone?
    <br>- You are hale and hearty?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ once again!
    <br>I started having those dreams I normally had in the past.
    <br>I would see myself in the village with masquerade chasing me,
    <br>with my gang when we were very small, trying to do some certain things.
    <br>At a point, a friend of mine said, "Let's go to a witch doctor".
    <br>I said Ok.
    <br>He said he didn't have money.
    <br>I gave him money and he went.
    <br>When he came back, he told me, "Yes, this is a place to be".
    <br>I said, "Ok. I want to go to that place, since it is a place to be".
    <br>I went to that place.
    <br>They cut my finger nails, my hair, marked my chest and feet, took my blood and put it on a calabash.
    <br>At the shrine, they told me to ask for anything I wanted.
    <br>After saying this, I should promise that the only thing the shrine was going to eat was blood.
    <br>I made some promises and I came back.
    <br>The whole thing became worse.
    <br>When I came back, I hated myself, "Why did I go there?"
    <br>Something inside of me said, "Forget about it."
    <br>That's how I got to know that I had two human natures existing in me;
    <br>one would be telling me positive things, the other the negative ones.
    <br>The one you choose to follow, that one will work for you.
    <br>At the end of the day...
    <br>Three weeks ago I was dreaming and it was said that the man of God would be coming somewhere.
    <br>I said I would go there. I went to the place.
    <br>When I got to the place, I saw people in white garments, but I didn't see the man of God there.
    <br>I looked at the front and I saw the man of God touching people,
    <br>and I ran to the man of God to touch me - I slumped.
    <br>When I slumped, it looked like I was confessing something, but I didn't know what I was saying.
    <br>Later I got up.
    <br>Can you tell us who the man of God you are talking about was?
    <br>Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Prince Obaerechi
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>When I woke up, I began to have this "disturbance"; one voice would say, "Go to Synagogue",
    <br>when I was eating, "Go to Synagogue", when I took a bath, "Go to Synagogue".
    <br>After two days of having that dream, the disturbance became too much.
    <br>Around 2:30 pm, I picked up my luggage and I entered a cab to go to Lagos.
    <br>Normally by that time, you wouldn't see any vehicle going to Lagos.
    <br>Inside the cab I was uncomfortable, until I fell asleep.
    <br>When I woke up, I saw myself in Lagos.
    <br>On Sunday I was in the church service; the man of God started mass prayer.
    <br>During that mass prayer I noticed that my chest, stomach, system - everything just changed.
    <br>My mouth filled up; because I don't like watching people vomit - it irritates me,
    <br>I didn't want to vomit.
    <br>When I opened my mouth, I vomited so many things.
    <br>I was very happy; my body calmed down.
    <br>On Monday, I was here.
    <br>When the man of God was laying hands on the people,
    <br>when there were only two people before my turn, I noticed that I was shaking,
    <br>all my body was vibrating, I couldn't even look at his face.
    <br>I'm just seeing it now when he touched me; I don't know how it all happened.
    <br>I woke up and saw myself being finally delivered.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Eventually, you were delivered that Monday, as you can see on the left-hand side of the TV screen.
    <br>You made us to understand that you were unconscious, and you didn't know what happened,
    <br>until now, as you watched the video clip.
    <br>Now, tell us...
    <br>We believe...
    <br>You experienced it, and your body knows it better.
    <br>Tell us - what are the changes you have seen in your life?
    <br>Compare your life before the deliverance and after the deliverance.
    <br>Before the deliverance, normally I had those dreams with women molesting me.
    <br>When I woke up, I would find myself wet.
    <br>I always had that spirit of lust.
    <br>I never had rest, a peace of mind.
    <br>But since that Monday - I slept off; somebody had to wake me up.
    <br>I slept very peacefully.
    <br>Somebody was complaining that there was a mosquito, but I didn't even feel it.
    <br>I slept, I was at peace.
    <br>In my dreams, people were fighting me, I was killing them - so many of them.
    <br>When I woke up, I wasn't even afraid.
    <br>I told the dream to my friend and he said it was a good dream.
    <br>Ok, in other words, God gave you victory over the demons that were attacking you in the dream?
    <br>Perfectly, sir.
    <br>Ok, now tell us - what changes have you seen, particularly on your body?
    <br>Concerning the spirit of lust - is it over?
    <br>Concerning the spirit of anger - is it over?
    <br>What about your relationship with your family members?
    <br>What can you say about that after your deliverance?
    <br>Before now...
    <br>My wife can testify that when I was angry, I could pull down this building within five minutes.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I didn't get angry up to three times in a year, because my anger would spoil things.
    <br>And I would never regret doing them.
    <br>But I noticed that I am now at peace; I take things more lightly, since that deliverance.
    <br>I have been overlooking things; I wouldn't see them as anything.
    <br>On Tuesday, somebody called me from Abuja about a federal contract for me.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>I have two advices.
    <br>One is for the parents: Some things you do in order to help your children will in the end destroy them.
    <br>When you have issues as parents, try to look for God first, before any other thing.
    <br>Two: to the youth out there who are watching me right now.
    <br>When you grow up, you will start noticing changes - things that are not normal in your life.
    <br>I wouldn't advise you to go to churches; I went to churches, to herbal homes, witch doctors;
    <br>they couldn't deliver me.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN, to the man of God I didn't want to hear about - here I got my deliverance.
    <br>Make haste! Don't waste time! Find yourself in the arena of liberty.
    <br>That God that saw me through, will definitely see you through!"
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Yes, we believe that our membership in our local church is merely symbolic.
    <br>What counts is Christ in you; the hope of glory.
    <br>We believe the summary of your advice is that everyone should make haste,
    <br>and look for Jesus Christ in any living church - is that true?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- To God be the glory.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us.)
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Elizabeth Obaerechi.
    <br>This is my lovely husband Mr Obaerechi.
    <br>Even before I married him, I knew he was a bad guy.
    <br>He told me that nobody could deliver him - that is what he always used to say.
    <br>No human being could talk to him.
    <br>I just want to thank this great God of Prophet T.B. Joshua;
    <br>that God used him to deliver my husband.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Amen! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We thank you so much for your patience all this while; you didn't give up on God,
    <br>you were with him to see this very day of his glorious testimony.
    <br>What is your advice to women like you out there?
    <br>Yes, I thank God; I always told him, that as far as Prophet T.B. Joshua is alive,
    <br>you must be delivered, and my happiness will be complete.
    <br>I want to give an advice to fellow women like me: They should be patient and trust God.
    <br>Nothing is impossible for God to do.
    <br>Amen! Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Finally, we thank God Almighty for what He has done in the life of your husband and in your own life,
    <br>for giving you enough patience to bear the situation with him, up to this present moment,
    <br>he is glorifying God with his testimony.
    <br>Remember, the deliverance, the healing came through the Word of God,
    <br>and we advise you to go and make the Word of God the standard for your lives.
    <br>As you do so, always have it at the back of you mind that better is not good enough,
    <br>the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
