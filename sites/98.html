  <p>    
    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities
    <br>which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua together, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen, right now.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
    <br>Viewers, the challenges you are facing right now - be broken!
    <br>Who says you are not a child of God?
    <br>It's sin; it's satan.
    <br>I say to you, you are a child of God!
    <br>Be blessed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That spirit of condemnation - you keep condemning yourself.
    <br>You cannot see beyond.
    <br>Condemnation all the time - you pray, you believe God cannot answer you.
    <br>That sin you committed yesterday - it continues to stand before you.
    <br>The thought you are having now continues to stand before you.
    <br>I say to you, be covered by the blood of Jesus!
    <br>Be covered by the blood of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Nothing is hidden to God.
    <br>That situation you cannot discuss with anyone.
    <br>You keep praying and fasting, but this situation refuses to go.
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Begin to confess your freedom right now!
    <br>I say to you, those of you who are under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>be blessed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I don't know that kind of doubt.
    <br>I'm speaking the Word and I'm the medium that God uses to speak the Word.
    <br>You can't see the Word. It moves; it's everywhere.
    <br>I'm saying, be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I declare you free!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen once again. Where are you?
    <br>God is there.
    <br>Anywhere you are, God is there.
    <br>Your situation - God is aware.
    <br>He is aware - that is why I am talking to you.
    <br>Be delivered!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever position you are in,
    <br>I pray the Lord will reposition you!
    <br>Receive a new direction!
    <br>Receive a new focus!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God
    <br>as you send your testimony.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
