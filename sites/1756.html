    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>- How are you, brother?
    <br>- I am OK.
    <br>- Concerning this son - a little boy.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>You have to agree and stop disagreeing.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Good morning, church.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Roland Asho-Ojong.
    <br>I am from Cameroon.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God walked to me and gave me a prophecy
    <br>concerning a disagreement over a son, that I confirmed to be hundred percent true.
    <br>Twenty years ago, I was having a girlfriend.
    <br>We had a daughter.
    <br>The second was the son.
    <br>My girlfriend came to me and said she was pregnant for me, which I refused.
    <br>Until the child was delivered, I never agreed that it was my son.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN...
    <br>OK, brother - we want to understand clearly.
    <br>You said twenty years ago a lady came to you and said that she was pregnant with a second child for you
    <br>but you refused to accept that this child was your own.
    <br>What was the reason that you did not accept this child?
    <br>Ya.
    <br>I didn't accept this child because I was still young, going to school.
    <br>We were just lovers like that and we were not living together.
    <br>So when she got the second pregnancy, she told me it was my son.
    <br>So, I refused because we were not living together and the child didn't look like me also.
    <br>So you mean by the time the lady gave birth,
    <br>you actually went to physically look at the child and you felt that the child did not resemble you,
    <br>so that encourage you to deny the child?
    <br>That's correct.
    <br>When she gave birth, I went there to see the baby, but the baby didn't look like me.
    <br>That is why I refused the child.
    <br>That was twenty years ago.
    <br>You mean all through the life of this particular boy, you never accepted that the child was your own.
    <br>Could you just tell us how was the child taken care of,
    <br>how was the child treated as a result of this?
    <br>Ya.
    <br>As a result of this, the child was being maltreated by my sisters and my parents and even me.
    <br>I didn't accept this was my child.
    <br>I wasn't considering him as my son.
    <br>During this period I travelled abroad to South Africa, to look for greener pastures.
    <br>There I was engaged in some illegal business, frauds, counterfeit business.
    <br>With this business I travelled all over the world;
    <br>to Mexico, to Indonesia, Europe, Latin and Central America,
    <br>doing this type of illegal business: black dollars, counterfeit business.
    <br>This is what I was doing.
    <br>Just very briefly explain to us that illicit you were doing.
    <br>You said you were selling counterfeit money.
    <br>Just briefly explain what that means.
    <br>That is correct.
    <br>I was selling counterfeit money; it could be used in black market,
    <br>but you could not use it in the bank.
    <br>So I always advised my customers not to go to the bank, so that they would not be arrested.
    <br>So, doing this counterfeit business took you around the world.
    <br>What happened in the course of you moving around the world, engaging in this illicit trade?
    <br>What finally happened to you?
    <br>Ya.
    <br>I moved around the world, I got money, I bought a house to my mother and my family.
    <br>Later I went to London, from London I went to Uzbekistan.
    <br>There I met one of our brothers who was from Cameroon.
    <br>He also came there for this type of business.
    <br>The person who made his visa was the same person who invited us also in Uzbekistan.
    <br>So when he came, he was only one week in the country.
    <br>The person who made our visas told him that we were his friends,
    <br>that we were also from his country.
    <br>So this guy met us.
    <br>The day he came, he was already spoiled.
    <br>As we met him, we were going to shopping centres, plazas, moving around, night clubs,
    <br>the police was following us without our notice.
    <br>So when this guy was arrested, they told him that he had his friends in this country,
    <br>doing the same business.
    <br>The guy was only one week in the country; we were three weeks in the country, in Uzbekistan.
    <br>The guy didn't even know where we were living.
    <br>When they arrested him, they called the person who made our visas
    <br>and he came and showed our house.
    <br>Ya.
    <br>When they came to our house, during the search they also found we were having counterfeit money.
    <br>So we were also arrested.
    <br>So you were arrested in Uzbekistan.
    <br>Just tell us the sentence for how long were you incarcerated
    <br>because of this crime that you were involved in.
    <br>Ya. Because of this illegal crime, I was arrested and given twelve years of imprisonment,
    <br>for belonging to organized criminal group from Cameroon.
    <br>Out of these twelve years we stayed for eight years, seven months,
    <br>before I was released.
    <br>Now, just tell us; because you had rejected your this child right from birth,
    <br>during the period that you were in prison,
    <br>what actually happened to him during this time?
    <br>Ya.
    <br>During that time that I was in prison,
    <br>my family couldn't take care of the child.
    <br>I was having my daughter and my son.
    <br>So the truth is, they sent the son away and told him
    <br>that he was not even the child of their brother.
    <br>The son went to mother and mother was taking care of him.
    <br>So we are understanding what our brother is saying
    <br>because when the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua met him,
    <br>he went straight and said that there is a disagreement over a son
    <br>and that our brother has to agree.
    <br>So our brother is explaining the genesis of this entire story and what happened,
    <br>how he was imprisoned, as a result of the lifestyle and throughout all of this,
    <br>he had rejected the son.
    <br>Brother, when you were released from prison;
    <br>just tell us what was the circumstances your were facing that led you to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Ya. When I was released from prison, nothing was moving in my side.
    <br>I tried all my best and nothing was moving.
    <br>Difficulties in life, everything has gone down, my business was down.
    <br>I wanted even to sell one of my lands, but I wasn't able to sell it.
    <br>One of my friends borrowed me money to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I came for a breakthrough, the man of God walked to me and prophesied
    <br>about the rejection of a son, the child.
    <br>So I stared thinking that twenty years ago I rejected a child,
    <br>so that was the cause of all problems I was facing.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hand together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Brother, you mean to say you never ever thought that what you had done to this child
    <br>was responsible for your problems.
    <br>It was only here, in The SCOAN that God opened your eyes,
    <br>through that word of prophecy to realize that the rejection of this boy
    <br>was what caused all of the troubles that you faced?
    <br>That is correct, sir.
    <br>I never ever realized that all the problems I was passing through were because of this rejection.
    <br>But when the man of God walked to me and gave me this prophecy, I was completely shocked.
    <br>I want to beg the church that...
    <br>Because of the prophecy of the man of God,
    <br>I believe in that prophecy and I will take the child to be my son
    <br>and I will do my best to support him and take care of him.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>By the special grace of God, after the prophecy that
    <br>Jesus Christ revealed to our brother through Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the lady in question and her son were invited by Prophet T.B. Joshua to come to The SCOAN
    <br>and today they are here in our midst.
    <br>We would like to invite them to come forward right now.
    <br>EMOTIONAL MOMENT FATHER EMBRACES SON HE REJECTED AT BIRTH!!! ðŸ˜­
    <br>Sir, just quickly - tell us the lady here - who is she to you?
    <br>Who is the lady to you?
    <br>The lady standing beside me here is the mother of my son.
    <br>OK. So right now we would like to hear a quick word from the lady here.
    <br>Madam, we thank God that you honoured the invitation of the Holy Spirit
    <br>through Prophet T.B. Joshua to be here today.
    <br>Could you introduce yourself to us and tell us who is the gentleman here to you
    <br>and tell us why you are here today?
    <br>My name is Natalie.
    <br>This man beside me is the father of my son.
    <br>OK, you are welcome ma'am.
    <br>So could you tell us how you met him and what happened when you were pregnant of your son?
    <br>I met him when we were young.
    <br>I had a first child - a daughter.
    <br>The second one is this boy.
    <br>When I was pregnant I went to him and told him that I was pregnant.
    <br>He refused the pregnancy and sent me away.
    <br>He said that the pregnancy was not his.
    <br>I said, "OK, I will go back home, if the pregnancy is not yours."
    <br>I came back to my mother's house.
    <br>Madam, could you tell us how you had been struggling, suffering to care for this child
    <br>without that fatherly care, right from birth?
    <br>He is now twenty years old.
    <br>Just tell us some of the struggles you have faced, as a result of this.
    <br>I was busy selling 'oje' in the market, so I struggled.
    <br>I had a little money so I lent a saloon.
    <br>When I finished in the saloon, I opened my own place.
    <br>I started to gather little money to send the child to school, struggling alone with the child.
    <br>I always was going up and down, suffering to take care of the child.
    <br>When the child grown up, the family came and took the child.
    <br>Then, the father of the child travelled and did not come back for nine years.
    <br>The family sent the child back to me, saying that I should take care of my son,
    <br>and that the father refused the son.
    <br>So people of God, we can understand what our mother has passed through,
    <br>trying to struggle and suffered to take care of this young man
    <br>because of that rejection right from birth.
    <br>Madam, today we can see you here, in The SCOAN.
    <br>Could you tell us the reason why you are here today?
    <br>I am here because of the prophecy that the man of God has said to my children's father.
    <br>I saw the prophecy.
    <br>I said that I thank God for the prophecy
    <br>because if not the prophecy, the father would continue to refuse this child.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>We join you to thank God for that word of revelation from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>that brought about what we are seeing here right now.
    <br>We want to hear a word from your son, right now.
    <br>My name is Kennedy Asho-Ojong.
    <br>I am the son of my mother, standing here, beside me.
    <br>Knowing that there was an issue concerning your father,
    <br>could you just tell us more about growing up and what happened to you?
    <br>Growing up was very difficult for me because
    <br>when I was still living with my mother, she had to struggle that I could go to school.
    <br>After, my father's people would come and take me, saying they wanted to live with me.
    <br>During that period there were difficulties.
    <br>When I was going to school, I was sent home to bring school fees.
    <br>At times, I would not even bother to go to school because I knew that
    <br>they would send me home to bring fees.
    <br>That was when he was travelling.
    <br>He went away from Cameroon for nine years.
    <br>His family was giving me things to go and sell.
    <br>When the school sent me for school fees, the family would give me things to go and sell in the market.
    <br>And we had a store in front of the door; I would sell in front of the store.
    <br>While growing up, when I was about 17-18 years old,
    <br>I was trying to do some little jobs around just to earn money for myself.
    <br>Could you tell us, brother; the time that they said this gentleman travelled for a long time
    <br>and you were sent back to your mother's house -
    <br>what did they actually tell you happened?
    <br>The thing is that they were hiding this from us, and from his mother.
    <br>When she went and came back, she called me and my sister.
    <br>She told us that his sisters are very wicked,
    <br>that they did not tell her that he has been in prison in the country he went to.
    <br>We were worried and we cried.
    <br>OK, so they were trying to deceive you concerning what actually happened to him
    <br>and that was how you were sent out of that house, back to your mother's house.
    <br>We thank God that our brother is here today in The SCOAN.
    <br>Right now we want to hear another word from our brother
    <br>who has received the Word of God, that word of prophecy from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Brother, we would like to ask you, in the light of this prophecy,
    <br>what do you want to say right now to the young man who is standing here?
    <br>In the light of this prophecy, that Prophet T.B. Joshua gave me,
    <br>I wanted to beg The SCOAN
    <br>that they should forgive me.
    <br>And I want to beg my son, that he should forgive me for all what I have been doing to his life.
    <br>I am going to accept him as my child and I am going to take care of him as a father,
    <br>in all what he needs.
    <br>So I am begging the church to forgive me.
    <br>I know I have done something very bad.
    <br>Please.
    <br>Please, my son, please.
    <br>In the name of God, I ask you to forgive me of what I have been doing into your life.
    <br>I beg for forgiveness.
    <br>EMOTIONAL MOMENT FATHER EMBRACES SON HE REJECTED AT BIRTH!!! ðŸ˜­
    <br>Forgive me.
    <br>I have forgiven him.
    <br>I am forgiving him because I never knew anything of what was going on,
    <br>even though they hated me.
    <br>The thing is that I never believed that I had a father, because...
    <br>... because his sisters told me that he was dead over there,
    <br>and after one year they needed to cut off his hands...
    <br>EMOTIONAL MOMENT FATHER EMBRACES SON HE REJECTED AT BIRTH!!! ðŸ˜­
    <br>So people of God, we have heard from this young man.
    <br>He said he never believed he had a father.
    <br>Even it came to a point where he was told that the man he thought was his father had been killed.
    <br>But today, through this word of prophecy, Jesus Christ has reconciled father and son.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>EMOTIONAL MOMENT FATHER EMBRACES SON HE REJECTED AT BIRTH!!! ðŸ˜­
    <br>We know that the right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>And it was through that prophetic Word of Jesus Christ, from Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>that peace has come to this young man and his father.
    <br>As the Prophet said in that word of prophecy that he has to agree and stop disagreeing.
    <br>And we can see the agreement in Christ right here.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>EMOTIONAL MOMENT FATHER EMBRACES SON HE REJECTED AT BIRTH!!! ðŸ˜­
    <br>For the glory of God, we want to quickly replay that word of prophecy right now,
    <br>for people to once again see what happened
    <br>when Prophet T.B. Joshua met this gentleman in the midst of the crowd.
    <br>He came for a breakthrough
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua went straight to the root cause of his problems.
    <br>Let's watch our screen and see that word of prophecy one again - what happened.
    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>- How are you, brother?
    <br>- I am OK.
    <br>- Concerning this son - a little boy.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>You have to agree and stop disagreeing.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>So sir, finally, we would like to ask you.
    <br>Now, through this prophecy, you have accepted to take your son as yours,
    <br>to take full responsibility.
    <br>In the light of this now, what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world
    <br>and people watching you right now?
    <br>My word of advice to the youths and viewers all over the world is that
    <br>you should never refuse your blood because you don't know what will happen with you in the future.
    <br>I have gone to prison for eight years, seven months.
    <br>I came back.
    <br>All what I worked for has gone.
    <br>Nothing is moving on my side.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN for a breakthrough.
    <br>I never knew that the cause of my problem was this rejection of twenty years ago.
    <br>I want to advise viewers all over the world to never refuse a child,
    <br>even if mother comes and tells you that she is pregnant, please,
    <br>I'm begging you, in the name of God, to just accept
    <br>because you do not know what this can cause to you in the future.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Finally sir, we know that you have apologized and showed remorse for your past actions.
    <br>Also, what would you like to say to our sister here,
    <br>that was taking out the full responsibility for twenty years,
    <br>suffering, struggling to care for this child?
    <br>We would like to ask you what you want to say to her.
    <br>I want to thank her for all the care that she has been taking for my son.
    <br>I'm taking this opportunity to accept my responsibility as a father
    <br>and that I'm going to support her and the son in any way I can.
    <br>And I want to ask her also to forgive me for all I have done.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Madam, I believe, in the light of what Jesus Christ has done,
    <br>I believe that you have accepted the forgiveness that our brother has asked for,
    <br>and you too are ready to forgive him right now.
    <br>Yes, I have accepted this forgiveness.
    <br>So I just want that we join hands together and take care of the son.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We give all the glory to Jesus Christ.
    <br>We believe that as God Almighty was the One that brought about this reconciliation,
    <br>Jesus Christ will inspire both mother and father
    <br>to continue to care for this son, in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
