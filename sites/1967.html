    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Children of God, praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Indeed the Lord is with us.
    <br>My name is Mr Abueze Ejike Timothy.
    <br>I am from Enugu state but we live in Kano.
    <br>My testimony is that the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua delivered me
    <br>from the spirit of bedwetting for 36 years.
    <br>You mean that you were having the problem of bedwetting for 36 years?
    <br>Yes. I grew up with it.
    <br>It was only when I was 36 years old that I prayed with Emmanuel TV and saw myself out of this mess.
    <br>It was a very challenging and difficult time.
    <br>The issue of bedwetting is more serious than poverty
    <br>because with poverty, man or a friend can help you but with bedwetting, nobody can help you.
    <br>I was unable to help myself or find a solution to that problem.
    <br>I tried, I prayed, I fasted.
    <br>Brethren, to be sincere, there was a time that I fasted from 6am to 8pm every day
    <br>for more than four months because of that problem but nothing came out of it.
    <br>I fasted again - four days dry fasting.
    <br>The day I completed the four days fasting, I bedwet.
    <br>I was helpless and nothing could make me happy when I was having that problem.
    <br>It was so severe that I knew that only God could help me.
    <br>I tried my best but nothing came out of it until a friend introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>What was your wife's reaction?
    <br>To be frank with you, my wife did not know I was having that problem.
    <br>She found out one night when she woke up and saw the bed wet.
    <br>It used to happen to me in my dreams.
    <br>I would be in the midst of people in my dream and excuse myself to go to the restroom.
    <br>Then, I would go to the toilet in my dream.
    <br>Immediately after going to the restroom, it would happen in the physical.
    <br>That night, my wife found out that the bed was wet.
    <br>You mean that before you married your wife, you never told her that you had the problem of bedwetting?
    <br>No, she was not aware of it.
    <br>You knew you were going to be always with your wife, 
    <br>so why did you not tell her about that problem you were having?
    <br>I would like to use this medium to thank her because she stood by me, even after noticing it.
    <br>She was the one who used to wash the bedsheets and encourage me that one day, it would be a testimony.
    <br>Today, by God's grace, it is now a testimony.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>At that time, when something good was about to happen in my life,
    <br>when a breakthrough was about to happen in my life, I would pray.
    <br>As I continued to pray, the next thing that would happen is that I would bedwet.
    <br>After I would bedwet, that thing would not come to pass; it would be a failure.
    <br>That was what I had been experiencing all these years until I got my deliverance through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Brethren, I did not enjoy anything like social gatherings, especially if it involved sleeping elsewhere.
    <br>I just didn't do it.
    <br>I would make sure I had an excuse to either leave before night or I would not go at all.
    <br>That was how it had been.
    <br>The enemy suppressed me so much because before I got my deliverance,
    <br>I would be in a dream and would feel pressed down.
    <br>I would be unable to move myself.
    <br>It was as if I was about to die.
    <br>Sometimes, a masquerade with strange faces would come to me.
    <br>It would hook and paralyse me.
    <br>I would be aware but not able to raise my arms or legs.
    <br>I was unable to wake up; it would come like a seizure.
    <br>It would grip me to the bed.
    <br>It was only after the torment when I was released that I could move myself.
    <br>That was how it had been all these years and it was very difficult for me to come out of it.
    <br>A friend of mine who had been watching Emmanuel TV for a long time, introduced me to it.
    <br>I bought the cable, installed it and began to see what was happening.
    <br>I began to see what God was using this ministry to do in the lives of people.
    <br>Hope came to me that I would be free one day.
    <br>During the mass prayer, I would gather my family and we would pray together
    <br>and most especially, during the time of prayer with Prophet T.B. Joshua - 
    <br>'Distance is not a barrier' - I would lay my two hands upon the screen
    <br>and begin to pray along with the man of God.
    <br>I would pray that everything that was bringing shame to my life,
    <br>in the name of the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, out of my life!
    <br>Brethren, before I knew it, I began to see the man of God in my dreams.
    <br>Now, to the glory of God, I might urinate in the dream but will not wet my bed.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You mean that after praying with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>that problem of bedwetting for 36 years came to an end?
    <br>Yes, not only the problem of bedwetting, even the pressing
    <br>and the things I used to see in my dreams sometimes like snakes and other things,
    <br>I no longer experience them and I am free.
    <br>I am totally free, in Jesus' name! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>So now you are no longer experiencing that problem of bedwetting?
    <br>It is now a thing of joy and a testimony.
    <br>I am now sharing it to the Glory of God.
    <br>The enemy has been kicked out of my life completely, in Jesus' name.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- Praise the Lord!
    <br>My advice to everyone hearing or watching me
    <br>is that Emmanuel TV is not just an ordinary station that we watch like movies.
    <br>It is a must for every home if you are really a believer because God is doing much through this medium.
    <br>My advice is to follow the Word of God in John 14:6, that Jesus Christ in the Way, the Truth and the Life.
    <br>Whatsoever one is passing through in life, Jesus is the only Way.
    <br>He is not one of the ways; I have tried Him and found that He is the only Way.
    <br>He will remain the only answer to every issue of my life and yours, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah. Put your hands together once again for Jesus!
