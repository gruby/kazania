    <br>Man of God, please help me! I was shot by an armed robber.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for this man in the power of the Holy Ghost
    <br>and uproots whatever that is not of Jesus Christ in his life.
    <br>Glory be to God! He is free.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Olufemi Daniel Olaegbe.
    <br>This woman by my side is my lovely wife.
    <br>I am here this morning to give thanks to the Almighty God, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>that delivered and rescued me from the valley of the shadow of death.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a face injury due to gunshot by armed robbers.
    <br>When I was travelling, I ran into an armed robbers' ambush, unknowingly.
    <br>There was no way for me to escape.
    <br>I don't know how God managed to take me through them.
    <br>Before I knew it, after I had driven a little distance,
    <br>I saw blood coming out - something was just pouring on my body.
    <br>When I touched my face, I realised it was shattered.
    <br>I was touching my bone - pieces of my bone - the teeth and everything.
    <br>I just kept driving until I got to a checkpoint where I met police men.
    <br>When they saw me, they were so shocked by the nature of it.
    <br>They were the ones that rushed me to the hospital.
    <br>At the hospital, I underwent many treatments and surgeries.
    <br>But after everything, the pain was still there.
    <br>Nothing could enter my mouth.
    <br>My mouth could not even hold water.
    <br>If I put water in my mouth, everything would drain out from here.
    <br>I was so worried, "Is this how I will continue to live my life?"
    <br>But I remembered that I used to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I have seen a lot of things being done by Prophet T.B. Joshua in the life of people.
    <br>I summoned courage and decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, I was opportune to be at the prayer line.
    <br>The man of God laid his hand on me.
    <br>You see that hand?
    <br>When he tapped me, I felt like my shattered jaw bone was being arranged.
    <br>Healed Of Face Injury
    <br>Due To Gunshot
    <br>I felt as if nothing had happened to me before.
    <br>I instantly felt alright.
    <br>When I got home after the healing, I felt hungry.
    <br>Whereas, I could not take anything apart from water during the time I had the problem.
    <br>But when I got home on that day, I ate.
    <br>I was surprised that I could use the jaw; the teeth could come together again.
    <br>I could eat, bite, and do everything.
    <br>Healed Of Face Injury
    <br>Due To Gunshot
    <br>Since then, up 'till this present time, I feel stronger and stronger every day.
    <br>As you see me now standing, I am 50 years old now 
    <br>but I have the strength of a 25 years old boy within me.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>I said, put your hands together louder for the miracle-working God!
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty. Our brother said it all.
    <br>He said his jaw bones were shattered because of the gunshot he received at the armed robbers' attack.
    <br>But today, we just want to have a look at that same jaw.
    <br>Can we have a look?
    <br>Tell us how you are feeling as you are touching it. Do you feel any pain?
    <br>I am free.
    <br>You can see, I can touch it.
    <br>Everything is okay, there is no pain.
    <br>I feel fine.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>Explain to us the pictures we are seeing on the board next to you.
    <br>Who exactly is on the pictures we are seeing?
    <br>This is me when I was at the hospital.
    <br>It was the doctors on duty that took these pictures to send to the surgeon
    <br>that they have a very severe case at hand.
    <br>Those are the pictures taken by the doctors in the first night at the hospital.
    <br>But after the prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>what happened to that wound we are seeing on that picture?
    <br>After the prayer from the man of God, the wound healed.
    <br>The doctors told me that the vein that comes from here and connects to the brain cut
    <br>and they could not join it together.
    <br>The doctors then said that even if everything gets better,
    <br>there will be a drain where water will be coming out from this place.
    <br>And that I should bear in mind that that is how I am going to be living.
    <br>But after the prayer of the man of God, everything miraculously covered up.
    <br>When they saw me back at the hospital, they were asking me about it.
    <br>They said that I am a very lucky man.
    <br>As you can see now, I am fine. Everything is okay now.
    <br>We thank God Almighty because our God is a God of possibilities.
    <br>What is impossible to man is very very possible to God.
    <br>God Almighty has proven to us once again that the age of miracles has not passed.
    <br>The Miracle Worker is still alive and His name is Jesus.
    <br>If you know that, put your hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Mrs Olaegbe.
    <br>My husband has said it all.
    <br>But I just want to give glory to God for saving him from death.
    <br>I couldn't believe it.
    <br>When I saw him in the hospital, it was terrible.
    <br>But I give all glory to God. Hallelujah!
    <br>Hallelujah! We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Viewers listening and watching me all over the world,
    <br>I want you to have faith.
    <br>Just as the man of God used to say.
    <br>Have faith in God, depend on God alone, and He will see you through.
    <br>Hallelujah! We know that with faith, all things are possible.
    <br>We give glory to God and we thank you for that wonderful word of advice.
    <br>We equally want to advise you as well
    <br>that God Almighty has healed you completely for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>So make sure you continue to follow Him along the way, making His Word the standard for your life
    <br>and His Word will continue to set you on the good road to the good life.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus!
