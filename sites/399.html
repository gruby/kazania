  <p>    
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>You have the grace to see the manifestation
    <br>in the power of the Holy Ghost;
    <br>how the name Jesus is working in the Spirit,
    <br>how the anointing of God is working in the Spirit,
    <br>and how the Word of God destroys the work of satan.
    <br>I stretch my right hand to destroy sin's power in your life.
    <br>All these things we are complaining about are as a result of sin -
    <br>unpleasant condition, situation, challenges
    <br>in your life, in your home, in your family, in your career.
    <br>Sin's power over you, be broken!
    <br>Power of idolatry, be broken!
    <br>Power of immorality, be broken!
    <br>Be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to break them!
    <br>Demonic power,
    <br>satanic power,
    <br>idolatry,
    <br>immorality,
    <br>unfaithfulness,
    <br>disobedience,
    <br>greed,
    <br>anger,
    <br>hatred,
    <br>sin's power over you,
    <br>over your life,
    <br>over your business,
    <br>over your career,
    <br>over your marital life,
    <br>over your family,
    <br>over your career,
    <br>over your destiny -
    <br>begin to break them!
    <br>Break them!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You know that sin is synonymous with satan.
    <br>It is synonymous with who? satan.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in -
    <br>the challenges you are facing,
    <br>unpleasant situations,
    <br>the challenges you are having -
    <br>are as a result of sin.
    <br>I say once again: Sin's power over you,
    <br>over your life,
    <br>over your career.
    <br>Whatever sin might have given you -
    <br>disease, affliction, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, HIV -
    <br>I say, be broken!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, begin to break it!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to break it!
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Break it!
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Will you turn to that pain, that affliction in your life;
    <br>I want you to turn now to that affliction
    <br>because God has given you the authority to heal yourself.
    <br>By His stripes you are healed!
    <br>Now it is time to heal yourself.
    <br>God has given you authority.
    <br>He has given you that authority to heal yourself, to cure yourself, and to cure others.
    <br>Right now turn to yourself and begin to break that sickness, disease, affliction.
    <br>Say, "You affliction, you sickness, you disease - let there be light!"
    <br>Let there be light!
    <br>You disease, you affliction - let there be light!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>If you do not hear me, your affliction will hear me.
    <br>I know that.
    <br>Because all power belongs to Jesus.
    <br>If you do not hear me, the poverty that is disturbing you will hear me.
    <br>Right now, I want to talk to that affliction in your life.
    <br>You affliction, hear me, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, let there be light!
    <br>Whatever sickness or disease you are having -
    <br>your challenges in your bone, in your blood -
    <br>I say be cured!
    <br>Be cured!
    <br>Be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, be cured!
    <br>Listen to me, say after me:
    <br>Be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, be cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, be healed, be cured!
    <br>Listen, you affliction - let there be light!
    <br>I say to your bone that has been under that affliction,
    <br>your blood that has been contaminated by affliction,
    <br>your skin that has been under the influence of affliction,
    <br>your muscle that has been under the affliction,
    <br>your fluid, bones, tendons, skin, muscle and blood -
    <br>Be cured!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
