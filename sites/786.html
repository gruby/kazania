    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>People of God - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The person standing here in named Etumodor Jonathan. I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am here to thank God for delivering me from the spirit of man which had led me into male prostitution.
    <br>It all started at my tender age when I went to the river to swim.
    <br>In the river, I found myself defecating.
    <br>It never ended there.
    <br>During the night, in the dream, I saw myself swimming in the river.
    <br>I began to see myself having sex with and affection for my fellow men.
    <br>The spirit kept coming to me at night to have sex with me, even when people were there with me.
    <br>When the spirit came, I had to satisfy the spirit.
    <br>I had to go to the toilet to masturbate.
    <br>This continued for more than five years.
    <br>I had the affection for my fellow men.
    <br>This became a part of me.
    <br>This spirit had led me to travel to various states, having affection for my fellow men.
    <br>I began to do male prostitution.
    <br>Older men would meet me, have sex with me and pay me.
    <br>They used to book a hotel room to invite me.
    <br>For me to achieve the goal of the spirits,
    <br>I had to start using the internet.
    <br>One of the sites is Facebook.
    <br>Second is "To go".
    <br>Third "Badoo", and so many other sites.
    <br>I registered myself on this site, "Chat With Men", which I didn't know about.
    <br>They would have to invite me to their homes, even when their wife was there.
    <br>They had to put me in their guest room, telling the wife that I was someone from their office or friend.
    <br>At night, we did what we planned to do.
    <br>If they had not yet married, they would come to me and have what they wanted to have.
    <br>It would not be limited to married men.
    <br>It was for married men and people from my age group or below my age group.
    <br>This act continued.
    <br>I travelled to an extent that I had to initiate people into this evil act.
    <br>There was a time I realised some money from the prostitution I was into
    <br>which I invested and started a business.
    <br>Then, I was thinking of quitting this act but never did.
    <br>When I was not fully into it, I began connecting people.
    <br>People would call me to come to Abuja but I told them that I had some things to do.
    <br>I told them not to worry an I connected them to someone else.
    <br>I started connecting people when I was not there.
    <br>People would go and give me my commission.
    <br>The spirit of man affected my dressing and the way I behaved
    <br>which was far from what a normal man would do.
    <br>I saw myself as a woman.
    <br>If I talked, I would talk like a woman.
    <br>If I acted, I would act like a woman.
    <br>I dressed like a woman.
    <br>My hairstyle is just like that of a woman.
    <br>Everything about me was just like a woman.
    <br>The spirit encircled me in the form of a woman.
    <br>If I spoke, they would ask me, "Guy, why are you talking like this?"
    <br>This was what happened to me.
    <br>This spirit led me too far.
    <br>It had infected me with HIV/AIDS Positive – 1.
    <br>Even with this HIV/AIDS Positive – 1, the spirit never stopped there.
    <br>It started pushing me to do more.
    <br>I knew that I had this for six years but the spirit did not let me stop.
    <br>If it was for a normal man, he could have stopped.
    <br>To me, it started pushing me the more – I became more into it.
    <br>I began travelling more.
    <br>I started infecting people and the people I infected, began infecting others.
    <br>The people I initiated were infected and they kept infecting others.
    <br>This attitude continued.
    <br>It all happened that I opened up a business but the business was not doing well.
    <br>I had to stop and go back to full-time prostitution.
    <br>As I was doing the prostitution, I had a good job.
    <br>Prostitution did not allow me to do the job.
    <br>I lost the job.
    <br>Then, I went fully into prostitution.
    <br>I tried to stop.
    <br>I remember when I was in Enugu doing the business.
    <br>I went to some prayer houses where they prayed for me.
    <br>I thought it was over but it was not over.
    <br>I found myself still doing what I used to do.
    <br>I had to go back to Delta to still do the prostitution.
    <br>I went to some churches for prayer but it never stopped.
    <br>A spiritualist prayed for me, asked me to throw away my ring and assured me that it was all well.
    <br>I threw it away.
    <br>I went to Lagos but during my first week in Lagos, I did male prostitution again.
    <br>Someone paid me and I kept the person as a partner for me to sustain myself.
    <br>So, despite your efforts these spirits refused to leave and they continued to push you into male prostitution.
    <br>Had you ever experienced a kind of public humiliation because of what happened as a result of these spirits?
    <br>A lot
    <br>I experienced a lot.
    <br>When I was in Delta State, I was publicly harassed that I had to run for my safety and life.
    <br>If it was normal and there was no force in it, I would have stopped.
    <br>The spirit never stopped.
    <br>I had to run all the way from Delta to Lagos for my safety.
    <br>If I was a normal man, I could have stayed away from this that drove me from Delta to Lagos.
    <br>I still went into such an act; I never stopped.
    <br>OK. Tell us how did you come to be here at The SCOAN.
    <br>When I was in Enugu, I stayed with my sister.
    <br>Whenever I came to her house, she always watched Emmanuel TV.
    <br>If I came closer or touched the TV, I always found myself on the ground.
    <br>I decided that when I came to Lagos, I would come to The SCOAN.
    <br>When you finally came to The SCOAN and Prophet T.B. Joshua was ministering mass prayer; just tell us
    <br>what happened at that moment.
    <br>At that moment, I felt uncontrollable.
    <br>I was trying to hold myself from where I was but I was uncontrollable.
    <br>I remembered when the ushers were holding me and when I was on the ground.
    <br>That was how everything happened.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>That was how the power of God Almighty arrested our brother.
    <br>The evil spirit within him was exposed during the time of mass prayer, as we saw earlier in the clips;
    <br>how that spirit confessed what he had done to him and to his affection.
    <br>We can see it on the screen.
    <br>Tell us brother, to the glory of God Almighty; ever since your deliverance here at The SCOAN,
    <br>what has happened to you life.
    <br>Since my deliverance, I didn't see my fellow men the same way – I always ran away from them.
    <br>When I see a woman, I will know if she is smart, lovely.
    <br>I have begun to like women.
    <br>I don’t wear tight clothes or do any hair anymore; I begin to dress properly like a man.
    <br>I begin to see myself as a man.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Right now, there is no more affection or attraction to your fellow men.
    <br>That spirit of man has completely left your body.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>We give all the glory to God Almighty for our brother's wonderful deliverance here at The SCOAN.
    <br>Looking back at you past; how did you feel thinking about how these spirits had pushed you to such
    <br>an extent of infecting so many men with the deadly disease, initiating men into this spirit?
    <br>Looking back; how do you feel upon, considering this?
    <br>I feel very sorry for what I have done.
    <br>To the people I had initiated, to homes I had broken
    <br>and to husbands whom I had taken away from their wives, I am very sorry for what I have done.
    <br>Please, it was not me.
    <br>We know it is not our brother, it were the spirits that actually pushed him to those acts.
    <br>It was beyond his own control.
    <br>We can just imagine how much havoc has been inflicted in the lives of many homes
    <br>as a result of this spirit and how many men have been infected with the deadly disease HIV/AIDS.
    <br>But we thank God that our brother is delivered and today he is set free.
    <br>In the light of this, what is your advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>Etumodor Jonathan Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We only have to hope on God for deliverance.
    <br>You may have it in mind that you were made that way but you are not made that way.
    <br>We are made according to the image of God.
    <br>Why do you want to go out away from God's image?
    <br>Please, wherever you are, run back to God.
    <br>It is only God that can deliver you from all situations.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>What our brother is saying here is that people having a similar problem, that are also affected by this spirit
    <br>of man or indeed a spirit of woman in the other case -
    <br>we know that deliverance from our Lord Jesus Christ is the answer.
    <br>That is why we are not here in any way to condemn.
    <br>We know that our Lord Jesus Christ hates sin but He loves sinners.
    <br>That is why we as Christians are to preach salvation and not condemnation.
    <br>That is why we thank God that the spirit that pushed our brother to such acts was exposed.
    <br>It is that evil spirit that we are fighting - not the persons themselves.
    <br>We thank God for our brother's deliverance.
    <br>We believe his testimony has really opened the eyes of many to realize this is a spiritual problem
    <br>and therefore requires divine intervention, and we believe that our brother is going to come back with more
    <br>wonderful testimonies to the glory of God, now that spirit has been kicked out of his life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>One more time; let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
