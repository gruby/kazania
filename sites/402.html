    402 - EDUCATION IS NOT SUCCESS - TB Joshua
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>You have offended your mum.
    <br>You see your mum as uncivilised; you are the one who is civilised.
    <br>Civilisation has carried you.
    <br>Please, help me.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>I met the lady when I was moving around.
    <br>I could see it in her that she had disappointed her parents.
    <br>You said they were not civilised.
    <br>Civilisation means maybe...
    <br>The young ones today - when they graduate, and their mummy is maybe just...
    <br>They believe it is unnecessary to call your mummy for advice
    <br>because she is not a graduate.
    <br>Someone who sent you to school is more than a graduate.
    <br>We don't know that education is not success but it is to help us to succeed.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Education is not money but it is to help us to get money.
    <br>You know the reason why education is like this today.
    <br>Our young ones believe that education is that success.
    <br>Once they are educated and they graduate they believe they have achieved success.
    <br>No!
    <br>You have to use it to look for success.
    <br>Success is different - it helps you to get success.
    <br>Education is this - success is this.
    <br>There are two successes - take note.
    <br>One success - God is carrying it.
    <br>Another success - satan carries it.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>This is success, this is another success - there are two successes.
    <br>This success - God Himself carries it.
    <br>This success - I will not carry it, it is satan's.
    <br>I will not carry it.
    <br>This success - satan carries it.
    <br>Education is to help you to get success.
    <br>Which success are you looking for?
    <br>Jesus says, 'The success I give you is not as satan gives you'.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The success I, the Lord Jesus, am giving you
    <br>is not like the one satan is giving you.
    <br>God Himself knows that satan gives success but with conditions.
    <br>When he gives you, he also attaches pain with it.
    <br>The success of satan - instead of you to enjoy the success,
    <br>it is that success that will be enjoying you.
    <br>The money satan will give you, instead of you to spend the money,
    <br>the money will be spending you.
    <br>Do you know that money is spending you?
    <br>You have money like this but you cannot eat anything you like.
    <br>They have to tell you, "If you eat this, you may collapse.
    <br>If you eat this one, you may not wake up".
    <br>If you use all that money from satan to send your children to school,
    <br>it would reflect in their life.
    <br>They may get it alright, first class, but you can see the pain they are going through.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>OK, let's listen to them.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Alfreda Dampreh Ofori.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my mum.
    <br>Then my dad and my auntie.
    <br>Last week, the man of God gave me a prophecy concerning me offending my mum.
    <br>What he told me was that I had offended my mum,
    <br>that I saw my mum as uncivilised and myself as very civilised.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>I am from Ghana.
    <br>I have never lacked anything.
    <br>From primary school, I went to secondary school - one of the best in the country.
    <br>I went to university after which I got a good job.
    <br>Everything had been going on well with me.
    <br>But I realised that when my mum talked, I would not listen.
    <br>Whatever I wanted to do is what I would do.
    <br>When my parents gave me advice, I would not count it as anything.
    <br>Whatever I had to do, I would do; I didn't care about their views
    <br>because I felt that they didn't know what they were saying,
    <br>that I was in the modern world and knew what I was talking about.
    <br>It happened that I got married to a medical doctor but things did not go well in the marriage.
    <br>There was no peace. There were quarrels.
    <br>My mum told me that I should have patience in the marriage.
    <br>I didn't listen to her.
    <br>I told her that I didn't care and to let whatever happened, happen.
    <br>This had been going on for some time until my husband left the house.
    <br>Now, he is nowhere to be found and we are trying to sort out the situation at home.
    <br>What the man of God said is very true.
    <br>Glory be to God - your parents are here.
    <br>Reconciliation is just the answer.
    <br>Nobody would ask you to go and bring them because you have no respect for them.
    <br>After that deliverance she realised that, "What I have been doing is bad.
    <br>I know he talked to them with honour and respect - that is why the family followed".
    <br>After my meeting here I called mummy, dad and let them know that it was not too late.
    <br>Take your daughter back - she is to be mummy and daddy's "pet".
    <br>They should bring her back home as a "pet".
    <br>She will start a wonderful life again.
    <br>All this while, you were very rude.
    <br>I'm going to talk to your parents and they will bring you back home.
    <br>They will take you back - you will start a wonderful life.
    <br>What a beautiful lady - you are not supposed to face these challenges.
    <br>So, thank you.
    <br>I want to thank your mom and your dad for coming here.
    <br>So, if mamma has a word...
    <br>I thank God very much.
    <br>My name is Mrs Mary.
    <br>What the man of God said is true about my daughter.
    <br>I thank God for using the man of God to deliver my daughter.
    <br>Thank you, mummy.
    <br>So, please, I will meet you and let you know that your daughter is going to surprise you this time.
    <br>The only thing you can begin to have a "cross" with your parents
    <br>is when you have faith in God of Heaven and earth
    <br>and they are not interested in that.
    <br>That is when you can be worried about your parents.
    <br>Any other thing; your mummy, father are not educated, unlike you -
    <br>that is not an issue.
    <br>So, I want to meet the family.
