    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I believe you are filled.
    <br>That is your confession. You say, "Fill me up, God!"
    <br>You are filled.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>One of the questions people continue asking - the reactions we receive:
    <br>What is the better way to define 'belief'?
    <br>You know, last week we were talking of belief or faith,
    <br>meaning what? Trust.
    <br>But the question they are asking me - and I realise that 90% of people that reply to us, ask this similar question.
    <br>So let's look at the Book of Mark 9.
    <br>I will just take a text from that verse 1-3 and I will go straight to the proof text Mark 9:2.
    <br>"After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him
    <br>and led them up a high mountain, were they were all alone.
    <br>There he was transfigured before them.
    <br>His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world..."
    <br>Let's now go to the proof text verse 23.
    <br>"'If you can'?' said Jesus.' Everything is possible for one who believes.'"
    <br>The question my viewers all over the world were asking me:
    <br>What is the better way to define 'belief'?
    <br>"Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, 'I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!'"
    <br>What is the better way to define 'belief'?
    <br>It's as good as, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief".
    <br>Because when you ask me, "What is the better way?",
    <br> that shows that your belief has not been giving you dividends, better fruits.
    <br>That is why you say, "I believe but I have not been seeing all this..."
    <br>"Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, 'I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!'
    <br>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit."
    <br>That is the unclean spirit.
    <br>He rebuked, "Leave the place! I command you".
    <br>"'You deaf and mute spirit,' he said, 'I command you, come out of him
    <br>and never enter him again'.''
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Take the Book of Matthew 14:26,
    <br>Phillipians 4:13 and I think that will also really help you.
    <br>One thing we need to know about belief is that it is like a seed.
    <br>You cannot plant a seed today and harvest the next day.
    <br>What kind of seed?
    <br>It develops in stages.
    <br>It develops in what? In stages.
    <br>There is a time to plant, and a time to harvest.
    <br>There has to be a time for you to believe and receive.
    <br>You may not have the manifestation
    <br>but you know that the seed has been planted, by the way you live.
    <br>Sometimes when you say, "I'm a Christian, why is all this happening to me?" - why are you saying that?
    <br>It means you are not a Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>"I am a Christian. Why is all this happening to me?" This means you're not a Christian.
    <br>"I am a pastor. Why is this happening to me?" This means you are not a pastor.
    <br>You are confessing your weakness.
    <br>You see somebody say, "I don't know, I pay my tithe, I go to church regularly,
    <br>you know I have not been smoking, I have left everything.
    <br>I don't know why all this is happening to me."
    <br>He is indirectly telling you that he is not a Christian.
    <br>You may not have the manifestation but you know that the seed has been planted.
    <br>In this world there will be...
    <br>This is why the Bible says, "I pray your faith will not fail."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The harvest is on the way.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>The harvest is on the way.
    <br>Don't forget what we are talking about: belief.
    <br>Say after me:
    <br>The development of the Word of God in your heart gives birth to the belief in your heart.
    <br>The development of the Word of God in your heart determines your capacity to believe.
    <br>The more the development of the Word of God in your heart, the greater the capacity to believe.
    <br>The capacity to believe depends on the rate at which you feed your soul with the Word of God.
    <br>CAPACITY TO BELIEVE
    <br>Say after me:
    <br>The capacity to believe depends on the rate at which you feed your soul with the Word of God.
    <br>The question: How do we feed our soul with the Word of God?
    <br>So much destruction,
    <br>unfinished job, unfinished argument,
    <br>unfinished discussion - business discussion,
    <br>political discussion: "Do you want to join us ?" - "No, when I come back from the Synagogue, I will see you."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Relationship discussion, debts discussion, credit discussion.
    <br>How do we feed our soul?
    <br>We feed our soul by reading our Bible slowly, repeatedly, attentively and with forgiveness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Look, the Bible is not a book you can just pick and say,
    <br>"I finished this Bible in one year." How can you finish the Bible in one year?
    <br>Each text, each paragraph, each message must be understood.
    <br>Sometimes when I'm reading my Bible, it may be just two pages.
    <br>I will stop because there are issues for me I don't understand.
    <br>I'll go back to my altar to pray, "What is the meaning of this? I don't understand!"
    <br>It may take me three days. I will not be able to read forward.
    <br>I will stop there, asking, "What is the meaning?"
    <br>How can somebody...
    <br>"What is the meaning?" - In revelation, they will show me the meaning. I'll continue.
    <br>I often hear people say they finish the Bible twice in a year.
    <br>They have turned the Bible into literature, history about events.
    <br>You cannot finish it, it's not possible!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because of the content there - we are not talking of the grammar.
    <br>As a professor, as an educated person you can read...
    <br>The understanding you give to it is different from...
    <br>When you are reading, there must be an issue, a message you don't understand.
    <br>Then go back to God, you can even meet the servant of God,
    <br>"Please, what is the meaning of this? I don't understand".
    <br>Until you understand that, before you go further.
    <br>We feed our soul with the Word of God by reading our Bible slowly,
    <br>repeatedly, attentively and with forgiveness.
    <br>You must have a free spirit to read; if not, you are not reading the Bible.
    <br>Without a free spirit, you are not reading the Bible, you cannot read the Bible.
    <br>A free spirit means, forgive and forget.
    <br>Whether you have been cheated, you are right or wrong, forgive everybody and forget.
    <br>Then you can take the Bible. If not, you are reading history - about events.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Slowly, repeatedly, attentively and with forgiveness.
    <br>The more you meditate on what you read, the more your spirit - your heart - acts upon the Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>To meditate, like you are sitting down now - meditation does not involve your body.
    <br>That is not meditation.
    <br>The more you meditate on what you read,
    <br>the more your spirit - your heart - acts upon the Word of God,
    <br>the more the Spirit of God will be released.
    <br>The Spirit of God will be released to the degree, on the level you stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.
    <br>How do we fill our soul with the Word of God?
    <br>By reading the Bible slowly, repeatedly, attentively.
    <br>So you need nature to read your Bible. You need what?
    <br>You need nature to read your Bible - nature enhances.
    <br>That is environment.
    <br>The question, the reaction of viewers all over the world:
    <br>What better way to define 'belief'?
    <br>Yes, when you talk of belief -
    <br>without God's will, God's promise, there's no belief, no faith.
    <br>There can be no faith without God's will - without God's promise.
    <br>God's will about every matter must be known to us before prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God's will means God's promises.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>God's will means God's promises.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>God's will means God's promises.
    <br>Yes, God's will about every matter.
    <br>Look at me. I want to turn, I must know when God asks me to turn, "Yes, turn".
    <br>If I do not hear from God to turn, I will turn on my own.
    <br>Many of us live life on our own.
    <br>He says, "Turn, go, go back!"
    <br>God's will about every matter must be known to us before prayer.
    <br>"Be healed!" - have you asked God, if the person will be healed?
    <br>Ask God. - "Yes, pray for them, they will be healed!" - "Ok, be healed."
    <br>But you don't know God's will about this woman that is seeking for healing and you are saying, "Be healed!"
    <br>That is why you see blaspheming all over today.
    <br>That is why you pray, as if you are talking to yourself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>God's will about every matter must be known to us before prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have not informed me that you are coming.
    <br>I suddenly saw you outside with luggage and everything; I will ask you, "What is this?"
    <br>So, can you see the reason why you keep praying, praying, praying as if you are not praying?
    <br>You pray, pray, pray, as if you are not praying.
    <br>Sometimes, when I move on my own,
    <br>I quickly withdraw because sometimes, at the beginning it was...
    <br>You know, a little baby sometimes may not hear his father clearly.
    <br>The father says, "Leave that place!"
    <br>You keep asking yourself, "Why only this ministry in the rural area of Lagos?
    <br>No branch here - in this rural area of Lagos!"
    <br>Because we are waiting for God's direction.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You would love to have a branch in your country,
    <br>you'd love to have a branch everywhere because everybody loves the ministry
    <br>but we don't walk by you, we walk by God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Love from God to man.
    <br>If God has not promised something and you force yourself to believe that God will still give you,
    <br>you are not believing, you are dreaming because you believe in your imagination.
    <br>In Mark 9:23, Jesus said that everything is possible for him who believes.
    <br>This means the level of belief differs - it's not the same.
    <br>What you may achieve in the name of Jesus, I may not be able to achieve it
    <br>because the level of belief differs.
    <br>What is possible for you in the name of Jesus may not be possible for me
    <br>because the level of belief differs.
    <br>Like we have said, the development of the Word of God.
    <br>Finally, as a Christian, you are what you are by faith.
    <br>A man is what he is by faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are what you are because of your capacity to believe.
    <br>God bless you!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, I have been talking since... But it is your turn to talk now.
    <br>Who wants to talk to me?
    <br>You want to talk to me concerning the message today?
    <br>Ok, I want to ask a question. How are you, sir?
    <br>Fine, sir.
    <br>What can I do for you?
    <br>I want to know God more.
    <br>Tell me the message today.
    <br>How does the message today help you to know God more?
    <br>The message today really spoke into my heart.
    <br>Because so many times you find out that the question in my heart is, "I am serving God so much.
    <br>Why is it that this is happening to me?"
    <br>By the grace of God, I follow your teachings, I study the Word of God,
    <br>practise them, not 100% but in those little areas, just as the Bible says that
    <br>if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain...
    <br>So the question will keep coming, "Why is it that as a Christian some certain things
    <br>that are happening to unbelievers, that don't even happen to them who don't obey God,
    <br>who don't practise all those things - why is it that it's happening..."
    <br>I am on the right man.
    <br>You are the right man. This one has answered our question.
    <br>A good example: You show love to people and you are the one that has the knife - they stab you the most.
    <br>- The people you show love to.
    <br>- Exactly.
    <br>Which is good.
    <br>Or in an office, you choose to be an exemplary leader.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>You want to be everything to everybody by the grace of God.
    <br>But the people that show wickedness to the staff the most -
    <br>they are the ones that they are loyal to.
    <br>You - they will fight you in everything.
    <br>But the message today has reassured me that as a Christian, that question, when it comes,
    <br>we should know that that is the true test, that we are disciples of Christ and we should wait for God's time.
    <br>That if it delays does not mean God denies us - God is preparing us better for it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good, our love to others - we should regard it as a sacrifice, not reward.
    <br>When you want to give, see it as a sacrifice because you don't know your tomorrow.
    <br>If you knew your tomorrow, you would be rolling on the floor to say, "Thank you, Jesus!"
    <br>God is keeping you for the future.
    <br>The future is great. That is why you are going through all this and this is the right time you can go through them.
    <br>Tell me the right time I should have gone through what I've gone through. This is the time.
    <br>I mean, this is the time. Time for everything.
    <br>There is time for everything; this is the right time - you are a young man.
    <br>You are a young man, so you must have a memory.
    <br>You must have a memory. If the Head of the house is being mistreated in such way,
    <br>who are you - you tenant?
    <br>The Head of the house, the Landlord went through all, and you are just a tenant of the house.
    <br>Generation yet unborn will live to see your work. That is why you are going through that.
    <br>That is what you should pray for - that generation yet unborn...
    <br>How many heroes you can claim today to say that they are your role models?
    <br>Generation yet unborn will need to see your work.
    <br>That means, you will live after today, your work will live forever.
    <br>That is why you are going through that.
    <br>So, please, see it as a blessing.
    <br>It's a blessing - listen to my message today.
    <br>The harvest is on the way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you very much, clap for my brother.
