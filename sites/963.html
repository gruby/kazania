  <p>    
    <br>My name is Chief Progress Neverdie.
    <br>The people standing beside me:
    <br>this is my sister,
    <br>these are my brothers - all of them are my brothers.
    <br>The last one is the PRO of the community.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My testimony goes like this: in January 2016, I was shot.
    <br>After they shot me, they shot others â€“ 10 people in number.
    <br>They shot me in the back of my head.
    <br>The navy there rushed me to Yenagoa and from there, to Abuja.
    <br>I was in a state of coma in a hospital, for three weeks.
    <br>My people thought I had died; everybody lost hope.
    <br>It was even posted on the internet that I deserved to die!
    <br>But, by the special grace of God I made it through!
    <br>Clap for Jesus!
    <br>I was with the Anointed Sticker when they shot me; it was close to my body.
    <br>People who are familiar with AK 47 will know that
    <br>if somebody shoots you in the head with one, you will die -
    <br>but by the special grace of God, I lived.

    <br>After I made it through the coma, the doctors said they could not remove the bullet from my head.
    <br>I was referred to India after undergoing three surgeries in Abuja that did not work.
    <br>Then, I could not move so they bought a wheelchair for me; I could not do anything.
    <br>It was then, they referred me to India.
    <br>After they referred me to India, they discharged me to a hotel;
    <br>in the hotel, I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>While you were in the hotel, you were watching Emmanuel TV?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you saw the man of God praying?
    <br>Yes, my faith was built up and I said that I wanted to touch the television.
    <br>I asked those around to help me and they did.
    <br>When I placed my hand on the television and prayed along with Prophet T.B. Joshua -
    <br>my brothers and sisters, wonders have not come to an end!

    <br>After the prayer, I began to vomit.
    <br>I vomited anything I put in my mouth.
    <br>My people were scared.
    <br>The bullet that the doctors could not remove came out by itself!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Our Lord is good.
    <br>You've heard a wonderful testimony.
    <br>Our brother still has a lot to say, but he is so exited at this moment...
    <br>This is the bullet - you can see it on the board.
    <br>This is my head.
    <br>This is exactly the spot the bullet came from, on its own?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You had three operations to have the bullet removed - all to no avail?
    <br>But after you prayed along with the man of God on Emmanuel TV, the bullet came out on its own?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>This is me on the photo.
    <br>One moment, sir.
    <br>This was at the time you were hospitalized?
    <br>Yes, this photo was taken when I was hospitalized in Abuja.
    <br>While I was on the wheelchair, I was wondering what I would do.
    <br>This was the first miracle - God was to finish what He had begun.
    <br>I asked my sister to bring me to Lagos and she did.
    <br>So, when I came I said, "God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, You are the One who created me -
    <br>not with a wheelchair; a wheelchair is not my portion."
    <br>I stood up and I told my sister to give the hospital their wheelchair back.

    <br>He said that after he had prayed along with the man of God on Emmanuel TV, the bullet came out by itself,
    <br>without any surgical operation.
    <br>He flew to Lagos but because of the crowd he could not enter the church.
    <br>While the man of God was praying, he prayed along with him at the auditorium.
    <br>Then he said to God, "This wheelchair is not for me. I want to get out of this wheelchair and walk."
    <br>That is how the miracle happened.
    <br>Since then he is walking on his legs without using the wheelchair.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>Now, for the benefit of the listeners, we want you to turn your head and show us the spot where the bullet was.
    <br>This is the spot.
    <br>When somebody shoots you in the head, you will die.
    <br>But I made it.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We rejoice with you greatly for having you rescued from the shackles of death
    <br>through your prayer whilst watching Emmanuel TV; right now you are healed and hearty.
    <br>Now, could you tell us - what word of advice do you have for those who are listening to you,
    <br>concerning what the Lord Jesus Christ can do because distance is not a barrier.
    <br>People of God: what you are hearing is real.
    <br>What I want to say is:
    <br>2 Kings 2:19-21 says the land was glittering, the people said the land was pleasant
    <br>but the water is bad and the land is barren.
    <br>Elisha healed the land with salt.
    <br>The man of God has the power to heal our land with the Word.

    <br>Now, we thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.
    <br>We certainly rejoice with you that the Lord has bestowed upon you the healing.
    <br>As you go and make His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>we pray that your miracle remains permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
