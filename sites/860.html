    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA - The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>I believe God will use me to add to your joy.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Already, there is joy in the house.
    <br>There is joy - you will agree with me that there is joy in the house.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's quickly take a look at the book of John 15:7.
    <br>"If you remain in Me and My Words remain in you,
    <br>ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."
    <br>This shows that Christ and His Word are one.
    <br>Simple. Take a look again.
    <br>"If you remain in Me and My Words remain in you,
    <br>ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."
    <br>This means, Christ and His Word are one.
    <br>Jesus - Word , Word - Jesus.
    <br>Christ and His Word are one.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>If the Word dwells in you, it produces prayer fruit.
    <br>F-R-U-I-T
    <br>How can this Word dwell in us?
    <br>It is not only committing the Word to memory,
    <br>because of where we are coming from
    <br>and how you are brought up.
    <br>You are educated and in education, academy, you need to memorise.
    <br>But coming to the house of God - the Bible -
    <br>it is not only committing the Word to memory which is indeed valuable
    <br>- it is good to memorise -
    <br>but allowing the Word to become an integral part of you.
    <br>You know we have a sitting room, and we have a bedroom.
    <br>So when you choose to memorise the Word,
    <br>it will only be acting in the sitting room but not in the bedroom.
    <br>But you need it in the bedroom because it lives in you.
    <br>It must dominate you, rule you and sanctify your spirit nature.
    <br>The reason why the Word must be an integral part of you is
    <br>because Jesus can only dwell in your heart through faith.
    <br>And Bible faith comes from God's Word.
    <br>I mean Bible faith; not faith - there are many faiths, all kinds of faith.
    <br>Bible faith comes from God's Word.
    <br>Like it is defined in the book of Romans 10:17.
    <br>Let me put it the way it is written there.
    <br>"Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing the Word of God."
    <br>When the Word dwells in you, dominates you, rules you,
    <br>lives in you, it will produce prayer fruit.
    <br>When you say, "In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name, Amen, Give me biscuit...",
    <br>you just receive them.
    <br>"Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus, here I am!
    <br>Forgive me, forgive me!"
    <br>You receive those things - these are the prayer fruits - if the Word dominates you.
    <br>The Word dominating you becomes the Lordship of Christ in you.
    <br>The Lordship; Christ Himself.
    <br>Letting the Word have right of way in your life is letting Christ Himself have right of way.
    <br>Say to your neighbour:
    <br>Letting the Word have right of way in your life is letting Christ have right of way.
    <br>Letting the Word have right of way in your life is letting Christ Himself have right of way.
    <br>If the Word has no right of way in your life, forget it.
    <br>So this is Christ - you go straight; it's like a magnet.
    <br>Nail - magnet.
    <br>If the magnet is there and the nail is here,
    <br>there's no way they can jump and attract - connect.
    <br>The Word dominating you is the Lordship of Christ Himself.
    <br>Message Title: BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>The Lord will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.
    <br>The Lord will only meet you when you obey what He told you to do, by His Spirit, based on His Word.
    <br>That is, act in obedience to God.
    <br>Like someone shared a testimony just now and said, "Praise the Lord!
    <br>The Morning Water, I sprayed it three times this way, four times this way.
    <br>At 12 midnight I sprayed it."
    <br>You quickly write down all those statements.
    <br>By the time you get your Morning Water, you get home and spray it.
    <br>"How many times did the lady say she sprayed it?
    <br>Oh! Four times!
    <br>This time - twelve midnight - four times!"
    <br>You now set your clock to 12 midnight.
    <br>When it rings, "Oh! I want to spray my Morning Water".
    <br>It will not work because this is imitation.
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Everything that becomes of us today is purely imitation.
    <br>You went to school because someone studied marketing and later became a general manager.
    <br>You say to your parents, "I want to study marketing".
    <br>"I want to study marketing."  - "Why?"
    <br>"Because that man is a millionaire and he studied marketing."
    <br>That is the only reason why you want to study marketing.
    <br>You have abandoned God's vision in your life.
    <br>You see a soldier or a military man with uniform - a general.
    <br>Beautiful!
    <br>You say, "Oh! I want to be a soldier!"
    <br>Just because of that very attractive uniform, you abandon God's calling in your life.
    <br>That's imitation of man.
    <br>Some people that are looking on might have seen some beautiful attire.
    <br>By the time they leave from here,
    <br>they will now begin to look for that attire in the market;
    <br>you want to buy the same uniform.
    <br>And I know many of you might have gone to the car park to see some beautiful cars.
    <br>You see a posh car - "Let me take a picture."
    <br>"When I leave church today, I have to look for this type of car. I need it."
    <br>Our life is full of imitation.
    <br>You look at different styles of hair, the way people plait their hair.
    <br>Message Title: BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>Life is full of imitation.
    <br>This is why we are very limited in our thinking, doings and way.
    <br>You can't go beyond when you are a type that copies.
    <br>You base your life on copying.
    <br>There is so much weakness in copying.
    <br>You can imagine how many business cards you have in your pocket.
    <br>You are the architect, you are the lawyer,
    <br>you are the accountant, and you are this
    <br>because you don't know what to do again - your copy.
    <br>Each time you see someone who is prosperous in his career,
    <br>you abandon your career - you jump into that career.
    <br>Prosperity is not evidence that you are called.
    <br>You can be rich in doing what you are doing
    <br>and yet you are not called for that job from Heaven.
    <br>You can be very rich in what you are doing
    <br>and yet, it's not your calling  from Heaven.
    <br>The end will prove that it is your calling.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The end will prove that what I'm doing is my calling from God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour. Don't be afraid.
    <br>The end will prove that what you are doing is your calling from God.
    <br>If there is nothing like that - people like me, where would I be today?
    <br>This is inheritance from Apostles.
    <br>The price they paid is what I am enjoying today.
    <br>So the price you are paying today, children yet unborn also need to enjoy them.
    <br>This is why we are saying that the world is coming to an end because everyone is copying.
    <br>No one is patient enough to wait for God, to hear from God.
    <br>You copy little things.
    <br>Even in the world today, we encourage copying.
    <br>When your children want to sit for an exam,
    <br>they are given opportunity for first choice and second choice.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So alternative everywhere.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>So it will be too soon for you now to say this is my calling.
    <br>What I'm doing is what I'm called from Heaven to do.
    <br>No! The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>Tell you neighbour: The beginner is not the owner of the job but the finisher.
    <br>When you start, you begin to run faster faster faster
    <br>and someone has been struggling to get to you.
    <br>But before getting to the end where you can receive the award, you suddenly fall down.
    <br>The one that is coming with effort passes you, and he will be the one to receive the award.
    <br>Issue of faith is an issue we should critically look into and see how it really affects your life.
    <br>Are you living by faith? Are you a faith man?
    <br>If you continue to copy and you are not patient enough to listen to God for direction,
    <br>you will go well and still come back where you started.
    <br>This is why you see people are up and down.
    <br>There is so much epileptic system of life today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A copy cannot stand the test of time.
    <br>This is why when challenges come, you lament and complain.
    <br>Challenges will come but a copy man cannot stand the challenges.
    <br>Who is the master of copy? Man is the master of copy.
    <br>But the master of original is God - God is the master.
    <br>No one can be built up with philosophy or theory about the Word.
    <br>You cannot be built up to walk with Jesus; it's not possible.
    <br>Or on the history - it is the history in the Bible that you rely on.
    <br>You want to hear story about Elijah and others. No!
    <br>The Word must live in you, and you must live in the Word to walk with Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As the deer panteth for the water
    <br>So my soul longeth after Thee
    <br>You alone are my heart's desire
    <br>And I long to worship Thee
    <br>You alone are my strength and shield
    <br>To You alone may my spirit yield
    <br>You alone are my heart's desire
    <br>And I long to worship Thee
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>You're my Friend
    <br>And You are my Brother
    <br>Even though You are a King
    <br>Sing on - I love you...
    <br>I love You more than any other
    <br>So much more than anything
    <br>You alone are my strength and shield
    <br>To You alone may my spirit yield
    <br>You alone are my heart's desire
    <br>And I long to worship Thee
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>We can only be a part of Christ when the Word dominates us.
    <br>You become part of Christ; then you can bring Christ on the scene.
    <br>"Jesus!" - you see Him on the scene.
    <br>Instantly!
    <br>You can only make a very thorough decision, true decision
    <br>when you begin to see each day as if it were your last day on earth.
    <br>But just look at yourself - "today's my last day on earth" -
    <br>you know you are going to meet Him,
    <br>so just take a decision. Let it be in your heart any time.
    <br>You say, "I want to accept Jesus, I want to follow Him.
    <br>Today is my last day on earth, I want to follow Him".
    <br>Just take that decision with the word "today is my last day on earth".
    <br>If today is your last day on earth, what else again.
    <br>You are finished with the world.
    <br>Over there. And He is the head of the immaterial world.
    <br>He is the head.
    <br>Invisible world - He is the head.
    <br>And you leave the visible world to the invisible world.
    <br>You will meet Him there.
    <br>Just take that decision today: "Today is my last day on earth."
    <br>You will stop all what you do; you accept Him.
    <br>Take that decision with this word of encouragement.
    <br>Your heart needs to be free; you need a free heart, free spirit to accept Jesus.
    <br>You are not free.
    <br>Free spirit can only attract Jesus - free spirit.
    <br>Your spirit is not free. So many things are going on in your heart.
    <br>A free spirit attracts the Spirit of God.
    <br>Free spirit.
    <br>To accept Jesus as our Lord and Saviour, begin to meditate on what you hear now.
    <br>The message you are receiving, begin to meditate on it, not think.
    <br>I'm not saying begin to think about the message.
    <br>No! Don't think about the message.
    <br>You can only think about your situation but meditate on the Word you hear now.
    <br>Turn it over and over again in your heart.
    <br>If you don't turn it over and over, it will remain on your lips.
    <br>There is a difference between the Word on your lips and the Word in your heart.
    <br>It is the Word in your heart that would release the authority.
    <br>There is power in your mouth; the belief in your heart is released by faith out of your mouth.
    <br>Let someone say, "There is power in my mouth;
    <br>the belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.
    <br>Again.
    <br>There is power in my mouth; the belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.
    <br>There's power in my mouth
    <br>When you say, "In Jesus' name! Amen!", power comes.
    <br>But before that power can be in your mouth, the belief in your heart must be released by faith.
    <br>If the belief is released by faith, it comes from your mouth again.
    <br>There's power in my mouth; the belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.
    <br>So this means faith is believing with my heart and confessing with my mouth.
    <br>There's power in my mouth; the belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.
    <br>So any moment from now we will begin to see what we are talking about - the power.
    <br>"Be healed!" - You see shaking.
    <br>"I'm healed, I am healed!" -  How does this come about?
    <br>Power in the mouth comes when faith release the belief in our heart.
    <br>"I believe" - No!
    <br>Faith must release that belief before you believe.
    <br>But today, we Christians believe without faith product.
    <br>Faith must bring that belief before we can say, "I believe, Jesus is Lord!"
    <br>If it is not released by faith and you say you believe Jesus is Lord,
    <br>you are speaking to yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>To speak of Jesus, faith must release that belief before it becomes a product or machinery.
    <br>"I believe, Jesus is Lord" - by what authority?
    <br>Yes, the authority is: The belief in my heart is released by faith out of my mouth.
    <br>Because belief rests in the heart.
    <br>There's no other place for Him.
    <br>That's the only place where He lives. He lives in our heart,
    <br>and it is released by faith out of our mouth.
    <br>Let's start something. Are you ready to start with me?
    <br>We will continue to build on it.
    <br>Meditation is of heart. Thinking is of mental assent.
    <br>Faith is not a mental assent.
    <br>Faith is not an intellectual agreement.
    <br>To have this faith now, all what you have seen and heard since morning,
    <br>and what you are hearing now, begin to meditate on it.
    <br>Meditation is of heart, not of mental assent.
    <br>The faith bracelet I gave you is not of mouth or of mental assent.
    <br>It is of heart and when your heart is engaged in something,
    <br>your body, face, appearance, faculty will remain quiet.
    <br>No one will know you are saying or doing something.
    <br>But today...
    <br>It's not of your heart but of your mouth.
    <br>Meditation is a visit with God.
    <br>If you want to visit Jesus, just meditate in His Word.
    <br>You will soon see Him, you will visit Him.
    <br>Come on, brother. Come here.
    <br>Stand here. I want to demonstrate something.
    <br>Stand here.
    <br>Come, stand here.
    <br>You see this lady is very close to this man.
    <br>Take, for example, that this man is Jesus, and she is close to Him.
    <br>My brother is a bit far; further than this woman.
    <br>If you want to go to Jesus, you will get there before this man.
    <br>So if we start meditation now, it will depend on the distance you are to Jesus.
    <br>Meditation is a visit with who?
    <br>With God.
    <br>You want to go and visit Him.
    <br>If the sister starts to meditate on God's Word,
    <br>and this man also starts to meditate on God's Word,
    <br>this woman will get to Jesus before this man.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So therefore, this is just a visit with Him.
    <br>You want to go and visit Him. To start the visit, it is not by running.
    <br>You cannot run to Jesus, you cannot cry to Jesus.
    <br>Crying cannot take you to Jesus.
    <br>Dancing cannot take you to Jesus.
    <br>Running cannot take you to Jesus. Walking cannot take you to Jesus.
    <br>Eloquent speech cannot take you there.
    <br>If you memorise the Bible, it cannot take you to Jesus.
    <br>The only thing that can take you there is when you begin to meditate on God's Word
    <br>and turn it over and over again in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Meditation is of man's heart. Man's heart means man's spirit.
    <br>Like I have said,  Bible faith is of man's heart - man's spirit.
    <br>And someone can also be here.
    <br>So if this woman calls, "Jesus!", He would likely hear it before this man.
    <br>I told you that faith is a Heavenly currency that purchases Heavenly resources.
    <br>What are we purchasing?
    <br>Salvation, healing, blessing and  prosperity.
    <br>They are Heavenly resources.
    <br>The amount of faith you have is the amount of Heavenly resources.
    <br>She seems to have more than this man.
    <br>This woman is having more Heavenly currency than this man.
    <br>If she just says, "Jesus!", she will likely cash.
    <br>This man will say, "Jesus!" 20 times before he cashes what this woman cashes saying, "Jesus!" once.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is an object that grows and develops in our heart or man's spirit.
    <br>Heart means spirit. As you know, spirit of man means heart.
    <br>So what I'm doing here now, by the time I reach there and say, "Jesus!",
    <br>the man begins to walk.
    <br>That does not mean that you don't have faith.
    <br>Maybe you are likely a bit further.
    <br>Maybe I'm a bit closer than you.
    <br>That's why when I say, "Jesus!", He answers.
    <br>You think you cannot do the same. You can do it but you are a bit further.
    <br>You just need to begin to meditate on God's Word and turn it over and over again.
    <br>You may overtake me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No one is born without that seed.
    <br>S-E-E-D
    <br>It is there, but maybe it is dormant.
    <br>It's just like a man saying, "I am poor" because you don't have money in the pocket.
    <br>No! A man that is poor is not a man that does not have money in the pocket.
    <br>It's a man without vision.
    <br>It is when our vision is closed - when it comes to an issue of blessing and
    <br>you don't have a vision for that, that's when you are poor.
    <br>So in the same way, people say, "I don't have faith".
    <br>Who told you that you don't have faith?
    <br>It's dormant - you have faith.
    <br>Faith activates prayer. Write it down.
    <br>You talk of activation. Faith activates prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>90% of my teaching is about faith because that is the only thing that pleases God.
    <br>You don't need to go to Heaven to see Jesus.
    <br>Religious people believe they must go to Heaven to see God.
    <br>Jesus came to restore the fellowship and relationship between God and man.
    <br>We are coming from a religious angle - all of us -
    <br>and we refuse to leave this idea of religionism - the idea of this is how it should be.
    <br>Yesterday's idea - we are still carrying it on to Christianity.
    <br>There is a difference between religion and Christianity.
    <br>That is why we receive so many attacks today.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>If you are not close to Jesus, you don't have a problem.
    <br>But when you try to be close to Him, you are in trouble - in the hands of satan.
    <br>That is why there is so much attack today on Christianity - everywhere.
    <br>With that, Christians are not united.
    <br>So who is the Christian? Christianity  is unity.
    <br>Christianity is not disunity.
    <br>Christianity is unity. Tell you neighbour.
    <br>Christianity is unity.
    <br>That is how we know a Christian. You can see them. They unite by love.
    <br>They greet by love. Their love sees beyond hatred.
    <br>Their love sees beyond attack. When you attack me, the love in me sees beyond that.
    <br>So that is it. Their love sees beyond.
    <br>But religious love does not see beyond attack.
    <br>When you attack them, they attack you back.
    <br>It is what you do to them, they do to you.
    <br>But in our case, when you do evil to us, we do good to you.
    <br>That is the Christianity that Jesus left behind - love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Your neighbour could be your enemy or those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>"Love them all" - this is what Jesus said,
    <br>This is the teaching of Jesus. What are we doing now?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Your neighbour could be your enemy or those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Love them first.
    <br>Don't say, "Because he's not a Christian, I don't want to see him".
    <br>You don't want to have anything to do with him.
    <br>Love sees beyond.
    <br>It is when I love you, you can know who I am and the God I am serving.
    <br>I can only win your soul when you are close to me - not at a distance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Draw me close to You
    <br>Never let me go
    <br>I lay it all down again
    <br>To hear You say that I'm Your friend
    <br>You are my desire
    <br>Lord Jesus
    <br>No one else will do
    <br>Nothing else will take Your place
    <br>To feel the warmth of Your embrace
    <br>Help me find a way
    <br>Bring me back to You
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>You're all I ever needed
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>Help me know You are near
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>You are my joy, You are my peace
    <br>You're all I ever needed
    <br>You're all I want
    <br>Help me know You are near
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will see that you must stop thinking about where you have been
    <br>and begin to think about where you are going now.
    <br>That's the answer and the way out.
    <br>When you look at where you are coming from, there's nothing glorifying God.
    <br>Meditate about where you are going
    <br>and stop thinking about where you are coming from.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>What does it take you to accept Jesus  genuinely?
    <br>The reason why it is difficult is because we believe in majority.
    <br>You have good friends, bad friends,
    <br>those who can influence you. Because of them, you cannot say no.
    <br>Whatever they tell you is what you will follow.
    <br>And you are going to be responsible for what you give your life to.
    <br>You will give account on the last day.
    <br>See Jesus as the final say and let us give all our heart.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and say after me:
    <br>Lord Jesus, I'm a sinner.
    <br>Come into my heart.
    <br>Save my soul.
    <br>Lord Jesus, save my soul.
    <br>Make me a channel - a channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Make me a channel - a channel of obedience where there is disobedience.
    <br>Make me a channel - a channel of pardon where there is injury.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Being a channel of shining light, out there in darkness.
    <br>We are in the world, we are not part of them.
    <br>Because in the world - full of darkness.
    <br>But when you are a channel - a channel of shining light - and you're walking in the world,
    <br>a channel of shining light walking in the midst of darkness.
    <br>There's so much injury and injustice, and now you're a channel of pardon.
    <br>So it is time now to give yourself to prayer.
    <br>Where you are accused wrongly - temptation, persecution - give yourself to prayer.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Begin to meditate. That will keep you busy.
    <br>There is nothing you have not done or seen.
    <br>The only thing you have not done well is your relationship with God.
    <br>It is time now.
    <br>Begin to meditate.
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into my heart. I am a sinner.
    <br>Come into my heart; wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me a channel of direction where there is no direction,
    <br>a channel of way where there is no way,
    <br>a channel of pardon where there is injustice.
    <br>Begin to refill yourself now.
    <br>Lord Jesus, I am a sinner. Come into my heart.
    <br>Don't say come into me. He lives in our heart.
    <br>Come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with your precious blood.
    <br>That precious blood is the blood of Jesus.
    <br>And save my soul.
    <br>If you are a type that lies; you can lie anywhere -
    <br>make me a channel - a channel of truth where there is lying.
    <br>Before you know it, where you want to lie, you will resist it
    <br>because you have called for help.
    <br>You have now become a channel of truth. You cannot lie again.
    <br>So you begin to fill yourself - fill yourself.
    <br>Make me a channel of truth where there is lying,
    <br>a channel of blessing where there is poverty.
    <br>Before you know it, you become complete two natures.
    <br>Because right now, it is like it is only one nature that is working.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>I said you have two natures but only one is working. The other one is shut down.
    <br>Which one is working? Human nature.
    <br>Your divine nature is shut down.
    <br>It is shut down.
    <br>That's why it's difficult for you to meditate. You can't meditate.
    <br>You struggle to say it in your heart because you cannot.
    <br>You struggle to say it because you are not used to it.
    <br>Every human being has two natures but today, people's divine nature is shut down.
    <br>It's only the human nature that is working, and human nature cannot pray.
    <br>The Bible says we don't know how to say a word in prayer.
    <br>We don't know how to pray but the Holy Spirit helps us to pray - that is divine nature.
    <br>We cannot meditate with human nature. You can only meditate with divine nature.
    <br>Because divine nature is of man's heart.
    <br>Divine nature is of man's spirit while human nature is this mental assent.
    <br>Memorising things - that is human nature.
    <br>That's why you have time to say, "Jesus, kill my enemies,
    <br>divide them, kill them, I sent back to sender."
    <br>Because there is nothing human nature cannot say.
    <br>It's killing, killing, killing; destroy, destroy, destroy.
    <br>The human nature wants to retaliate; they derive joy in retaliation
    <br>but your divine nature leaves all for God.
    <br>Divine nature, today, seems to be dormant, unused.
    <br>We need to revive it, we need to clean it.
    <br>We need to clean it very well, to revive it for action.
    <br>Thank you. God bless you.
    <br>I want to pray for your spirit and your heart.
    <br>Father, rescue my people.
    <br>Rescue my people.
    <br>You know you need rescue - you need rescue.
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>That is divine nature.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
