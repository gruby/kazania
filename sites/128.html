    <br>WORDS OF WISDOM
    <br>Let's look at our friend that has passed through this - a biblical character.
    <br>Let's go to the Book of Job; he is our friend - we are looking at his footstep -
    <br>how to handle the situation.
    <br>Job 1:21
    <br>“And he said, ‘Naked I came from my mother’s womb’.”
    <br>When you read that - it refers you to the first day when you were delivered - you said, "Ah ah".
    <br>If you did not cry, "Ah ah", they would give you a (spank).
    <br>They want to know whether you are still there.
    <br>Nobody actually came with gold and silver.
    <br>No matter what you are wearing now, no matter how beautiful or how you look,
    <br>"...'Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there’.”
    <br>No matter what they use on the last day to cover you; gold, silver...
    <br>By the time they just cover you with the dust and turn back,
    <br>if care is not taken, some people will come to dig the ground and carry the body.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>This is what Job is telling us now:
    <br>"...'Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there.
    <br>The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away;
    <br>Blessed be the name of the LORD.’”
    <br>This means no one can be so poor as he was at birth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>No one can be so poor as he was at birth.
    <br>You cannot be so poor as you were at birth.
    <br>You say, "I'm poor, this, that".
    <br>Remember how you came and also remember how you will return.
    <br>When you have this in your heart,
    <br>no matter the situation you are in, blessed be His holy name.
    <br>The purpose of life is to glorify God in good times and hard times alike.
    <br>Those who bless God in trouble prove their sonship.
    <br>"Yes, I'm a child of God."
    <br>You must honour God before men.
    <br>Prove your sonship, "I'm a child of God".
    <br>That you are sick does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>That you are sick does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>That you are poor does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>A man can be sick in body yet be a friend of God.
    <br>Don’t let your situation mislead you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Don’t let your situation mislead you.
    <br>I cannot heart you.
    <br>Don’t let your situation mislead you.
    <br>Job 1:21, I call words of wisdom.
    <br>It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, heal me!" - and you did not receive an answer to your prayer;
    <br>you say, "...because of my sin", or "I'm not a believer".
    <br>Satan is using that key to destroy people's faith.
    <br>"You have not received healing - go to witch doctor, go and see the spiritualist, don't waste your time."
    <br>"I have not been coming to church because I was not healed. I'm still having the pain.
    <br>My debt keeps increasing, so I cannot continue coming to church."
    <br>It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>I know many of you have the belief
    <br>that once you are sick, you are not a believer
    <br>but a man may be sick in body yet be a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>If a man is lying down on the sickbed, and at the end of the day the man dies,
    <br>it will be too soon for you to say, "He is going to hell".
    <br>A man can be sick yet be a friend of God.
    <br>If you know this, satan cannot come near you.
    <br>The devil wants you to curse God while under pain.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>The devil wants me to curse God while under pain.
    <br>"I don't know what is wrong. I pay my tithe, I go to church regularly.
    <br>This my friend; he is a smoker - he was never sick one day.
    <br>This my friend, he sleeps in the clubhouse - he never got cancer or whatever.
    <br>But me, I'm decent, I live right, I'm a Christian, I've been upright
    <br>since I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Saviour - why this cancer?"
    <br>The devil wants you to curse God while under pain, while under trouble.
    <br>That is why the devil takes delight in inflicting pain on people.
    <br>When he came to God, he said, "You said Job is upright, an honest man.
    <br>Tell me why Job would not be honest when You have blessed him with everything.
    <br>He has children, money, good health, and You are saying he is a good man.
    <br>Tell me why he wouldn't be good when he has everything.
    <br>Allow me to touch him and see whether he would not change his confession."
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>The devil wants you to curse God while under pain.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>The devil wants you to curse God while under pain.
    <br>And the Lord said, "OK, go ahead, but I will not give you his heart."
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>The Bible says faith is of man’s heart.
    <br>Those who bless God in trouble prove their sonship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Those who bless God in trouble prove their sonship.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Those who bless God in trouble prove their sonship.
    <br>"I'm a child of God because business is booming, there is money in the pocket."
    <br>Today, this is how we know a child of God.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>We know a child of God when money is in the pocket.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>We know a child of God when money is in the pocket.
    <br>The world turned upside down.
    <br>Situation is now misleading people.
    <br>People are being misled by what?
    <br>By situation!
    <br>When the goings are good, you wear a beautiful dress to church.
    <br>People can know when the goings are tough.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>The purpose of life is to glorify God in good times and hard times alike.
    <br>Those who bless God in trouble, those who bless God in temptation,
    <br>prove their sonship.
    <br>May God bless His Word.

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Just a short summary.
    <br>That you are sick does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>A man may be sick yet be a friend of God.
    <br>That you are poor does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>Don’t let your situation mislead you.
    <br>Whatever situation you are facing, don’t let your situation mislead you.
    <br>That you are having difficulty to move does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>A man or woman may have difficulty in walking or a fracture of the ankle
    <br>yet be a friend of God.
    <br>That you are barren does not make you an unbeliever.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>A woman may be barren yet be a friend of God.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>In the past, before you came here, you were questioning your faith.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>You were looking at God in a bad light.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>Your situation has affected your faith.
    <br>Yes, daddy. It is true, sir.
    <br>Your situation has misled you.
    <br>Yes, daddy. Sometimes, I don’t feel like going to church.
    <br>Sometimes, I don’t feel like going to the midst of people where they are praying
    <br>because I don’t know the value of it.
    <br>It has pushed you to spiritualists and all others.
    <br>You are correct, sir. Thank you, sir.
    <br>This is not supposed to be.
    <br>I think this is the first time you are hearing this message.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>This is the first time you are hearing the message.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What is going on in your heart now, with this message?
    <br>What is going on in my heart now is that I am OK
    <br>and God has answered my prayer.
    <br>Clap for Jesus.
    <br>This is what satan has been using.
    <br>The devil wants us to curse God while under pain,
    <br>under sickness, under temptation.
    <br>He wants us to begin to see God in a bad light.
    <br>And you are supposed to honour Him in that situation.
    <br>The devil wants us to curse God, to speak against God
    <br>while under trouble.
    <br>That is why the devil takes delight in inflicting pain on people.
    <br>You are about to receive the mother of miracles.
    <br>If your miracle is delayed, you are about to receive the mother of miracles.
    <br>This is your first time you are hearing this message.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Because of your situation, what was going through your mind?
    <br>I was asking myself what I had done to the Lord because it is five years now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line
    <br>Can you imagine that?
    <br>She said she was asking God, "What have I done to You?"
    <br>And God is whom He says He is - He does not change.
    <br>That is what the devil wants.
    <br>The devil wants us to curse God while under pain.
    <br>That is why the devil takes delight in inflicting pain,
    <br>inflicting poverty, inflicting sickness,
    <br>inflicting hardship on people.
    <br>There are many on the sickbed who have been rebuking God,
    <br>asking God, “God, what have I done to You?”
    <br>Those of you who are under the influence of this telecast, listen to me.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>You have been praying for so long, asking God to heal you,
    <br>"Heal me!" - and you are not healed.
    <br>Who knows if you were healed, what would have happened to you?
    <br>God’s time is the best.
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>Who knows if my prayer in the past had been answered, what would have happened to me.
    <br>If my prayer for healing, breakthrough, this, that, had been answered,
    <br>who knows what would have happened to me.
    <br>Whatever you are going through,
    <br>it may be to preserve you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to prepare you.
    <br>It may be to strengthen your desire for God, the situation you are facing today.
    <br>Pleasure cannot do this -  a time like this can do better.
    <br>Viewers at home, I pray with you.
    <br>I pray your faith will not fail
    <br>in the face of that crisis, in the face of difficulty
    <br>because satan wants you to curse God while under pain.
    <br>I pray your faith will not fail.
    <br>This is the prayer of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>He said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>I pray your faith will not fail.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I want you to say, "Blessed be His holy name".
    <br>In good times and hard times, blessed be His holy name.
    <br>In sickness, in good health, blessed be His holy name.
    <br>Blessed be His name!
