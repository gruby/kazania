  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>wherever you are, whatever you are doing right now -
    <br>when I say viewers, I mean those under the influence of my voice -
    <br>Jesus loves you just as He loves all His apostles.
    <br>Right now, it is time to pray.
    <br>I pray your faith will not fail.
    <br>Whatever resistance - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it your weakness, your shortcoming -
    <br>whatever resistance - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Resistance can be doubt, unbelief, bad habits.
    <br>Something is telling you, "No, your prayer cannot answer, don't worry yourself.
    <br>No, this prayer is not for you".
    <br>This is resistance.
    <br>Whatever resistance - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Resistance is a hindrance; it's a wall between you and God, the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>Ask yourself, what is that resistance?
    <br>You deserve excellence.
    <br>Say, "I deserve excellence".
    <br>What could be the resistance?
    <br>You are the head but today the tail.
    <br>Many are doing someone else's job.
    <br>Many are in a place where they are not supposed to be.
    <br>Whatever resistance - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are created as the head, not the tail.
    <br>Whatever resistance - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It could be your bad habit.
    <br>Resistance could be the way you walk.
    <br>Some of us - when you are walking, you put your hand in your pocket and begin to do like this.
    <br>This is the person that is homeless, he has no house.
    <br>But when he is walking...
    <br>It is only Jesus that can help people like that.
    <br>I remove that resistance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Some of us too as well - when you see the appearance of some of us,
    <br>they have nothing, everything they put on is borrowed.
    <br>And they want to get married
    <br>Instead of taking that person to his own house,
    <br>he will now rent a very big house for that purpose.
    <br>He will park a jeep, beautiful jeep, car.
    <br>And he shows the house, "This is my house".
    <br>"Eh, this is your house?"
    <br>By the time the lady gets to the house, she will realise that this is not the house;
    <br>it is somebody's house.
    <br>I remove that resistance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Many of us, what we are receiving is little but we are living in a duplex.
    <br>Cut your coat according to your size so that people can help you.
    <br>This is resistance.
    <br>Some people, when they drop their car, you will think that, "Ah, you cannot employ this one".
    <br>Whereas you can employ him - he has nothing!
    <br>I remove resistance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Please, let's cut our coat according to our size.
    <br>Those who want to help you also deserve some honour.
    <br>They deserve some honour.
    <br>Even to know that the person I want to help deserves it.
    <br>I remove the resistance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Think about this issue of resistance.
    <br>Let them see how you look.
    <br>Let them see, let them know.
    <br>Let them know you are from a humble background.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to rebuke that resistance in your life.
    <br>Everyone has this; everyone has this resistance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I want to believe the resistance has been removed!
    <br>Receive your deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your heart; allow the inner man to receive right now.
    <br>Receive your deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let God's Word be true for your bones!
    <br>Let God's Word be true for your kidneys!
    <br>Let God's Word be true for your blood!
    <br>Your bones, your tendons - every part of your faculties.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I'm speaking to you - give thanks to God.
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>I can see you being healed!
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>I can see you being healed!
    <br>Begin to give thanks to God.
    <br>Wherever that affliction is - I plead the name of Jesus, the blood of Jesus!
    <br>Right now - freedom!
    <br>In your kidneys - freedom!
    <br>In your liver - freedom!
    <br>In your blood - freedom!
    <br>In your bones - freedom!
    <br>In all faculties, in all your organs - freedom!
    <br>Receive freedom!
    <br>Good health!
    <br>Freedom!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
