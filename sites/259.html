    <br>I will put more light on this sticker
    <br>because I was praying and saying to God, let me put a cross, just a cross.
    <br>The Lord said, "Put your picture there".
    <br>I keep asking God, "Why my picture?"
    <br>He said, "Yes, people need the grace to dream dreams and to see visions".
    <br>Let love lead.
    <br>The rule in this is that you must love.
    <br>You must love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Love God above all.
    <br>If you can do that, no one can stand against you.
    <br>People will try it.
    <br>You have a battle. You may come out with bruises but you will overcome!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>You will overcome.
    <br>Now, don't just use one hand to collect it.
    <br>Collect it because you are collecting fire.
    <br>The New Anointing Sticker
    <br>Christ's workers sent by the Lord's servant Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>moved throughout the auditorium of the SCOAN,
    <br>sharing the new Anointing Sticker to the people in the name of Jesus and the blood of Jesus.
    <br>When the people started receiving the new Anointing Sticker,
    <br>hundreds fell under the healing and delivering power of the blood of Jesus and the fire of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The impact was evident all over the auditorium
    <br>as people that were held captive by evil spirits were exposed and delivered in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the book of Acts we read about how God Almighty used different mediums to express Himself.
    <br>Anything that had come in contact with Apostle Paul was taken to the sick and demon possessed
    <br>and they were healed and delivered. As it was then, so it is today.
    <br>The book of Acts is not mere history but a pattern of what Jesus Christ wants His church to be today.
    <br>His healing, delivering and saving grace has not stopped just because He is no longer visible in our midst.
    <br>In fact, it is even greater because Jesus can be at places at all times by His spirit.
    <br>Hundreds of people that were afflicted with sicknesses and diseases also vomited out
    <br>all the poisonous substances within their bodies
    <br>and they were healed when they received the new Anointing Sticker.
    <br>If there is anyone here that is trying to avoid this sticker,
    <br>because once you have this sticker, you are under the influence of God Almighty.
    <br>If there is anyone that was avoiding this sticker while they were giving it out - right now, Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>I rebuke you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Wherever you are!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits After Receiving The Anointing Sticker
    <br>Hundreds all over the auditorium that avoided the new Anointing Sticker
    <br>fell under the anointing of Jesus Christ as Prophet T.B. Joshua declared Holy Ghost fire
    <br>to consume whatever that was not of God in the peoples' lives.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits After Receiving The Anointing Sticker
    <br>You people should stop.
    <br>I will talk!  You people should stop!
    <br>I will talk.
    <br>I'm from the water.
    <br>You said what?
    <br>Please, I will not come again. Please allow me to go.
    <br>You will not come here again?
    <br>Allow me to go, I won't come again.
    <br>Please leave me now!
    <br>Your presence is biting me.
    <br>My body.
    <br>Have you been watching Emmanuel TV?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When my mother came here, you delivered her, and she left.
    <br>I decided to come. I wanted to leave when
    <br>you started distributing the Anointing Sticker.
    <br>My body is itching me.
    <br>You have delivered many of my people, I don't want you to continue again.
    <br>My name is Charity Omero. I'm from
    <br>Abia State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am 19 years old.
    <br>The woman standing next to me is my mom.
    <br>My mom was a queen in my kingdom
    <br>while I was a princess.
    <br>When she left the kingdom, everybody in the kingdom was annoyed.
    <br>They wanted her back by all means, but the prayer of the wise men couldn't allow her to come back.
    <br>So they decided that I should go,
    <br>saying that I should either kill Wise Man Daniel, Prophet T.B. Joshua or my mom.
    <br>I love my mom so much, that I didn't want to kill her.
    <br>So I decided to take the risk to come and kill Wise Man Daniel and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When I came inside the church, I had four powers.
    <br>Two in my hand, one in my eye, and the other one in my private part.
    <br>Whenever I travelled to my kingdom,
    <br>my upper body would be like a human being, while waist down would be like a snake.
    <br>So with the power in my eye, if I looked at you, you wouldn't get yourself again.
    <br>My hand was poisonous. Any drink or glass cup I touched was poisoned.
    <br>If I couldn't get you through this, my last hope was by showing my nakedness.
    <br>If you saw me naked, you would be attracted to me and you would fall for me.
    <br>When I came inside the church, my plan was that
    <br>I would waive my hand and all the electricity would go off.
    <br>I would make everyone in the church go to sleep.
    <br>Then I would come to the altar, tear the man of God's clothes and my own.
    <br>Then either he would do what I told him or if he refused,
    <br>I would wake everyone up and seeing that, they would not believe that he was a true man of God.
    <br>Through that, I would have damaged his name.
    <br>I have destroyed so many men of God and people around me.
    <br>Most of these men of God, if they came to pray for me in my house, I would look straight into their eyes.
    <br>Instead of them preaching the Word of God, they would turn around and say other things like,
    <br>"Come, let's go out. Where are we going to drink?"
    <br>I would start laughing at them.
    <br>I would say, "Look at these people!"
    <br>Later they would say that they are praising God and that they don't know what they are doing.
    <br>I did many things, especially to men of God because they are the ones tying us down.
    <br>When I came to the church, that was my plan for the man of God.
    <br>I tried waving my hand several times to stop the electricity, but it would not go off,
    <br>When I tried to do it to Prophet T.B. Joshua, I found out that this man was too strong.
    <br>I tried and tried, but it was not working for me.
    <br>I was angry, so I went outside.
    <br>As I went outside, I didn't know what pushed me inside the church again,
    <br>saying, "Come on, will you go back!"
    <br>I came inside angrily and immediately I wanted to sit down, one of the ushers gave me this sticker.
    <br>I didn't know whether I was to hold the sticker, throw it on the floor or reject it.
    <br>I collected the sticker.
    <br>When I took it, my hand became hot as if fire was all over my hands.
    <br>My hand was catching fire. It was as if someone gave me fire to hold for him or her.
    <br>I was hot from my hands, to my fingers, all over my body, my hair and inside me.
    <br>I felt like tearing my clothes, I wanted them to bring me water to pour over me,
    <br>to see if it would cool down but it was 
    <br>too much for me to withstand it.
    <br>I couldn't take it. I opened my handbag to put the Anointing Sticker inside.
    <br>After I put it inside, I was still holding my handbag.
    <br>But I couldn't even drop my handbag on the floor, so I took it out again.
    <br>I then put it on the chair, thinking that would stop it but the fire was still burning all over me.
    <br>I didn't know what to do. I fell down.
    <br>I was delivered through the Anointing Sticker and the prayers of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I would sleep when I felt like it was time to go to our meetings.
    <br>I would sleep like someone who was dead.
    <br>If anyone moved close to me and accidentally touched me,
    <br>I would die and not come back.
    <br>Therefore when I wanted to sleep, I would sleep alone.
    <br>These things had been happening to me since my childhood.
    <br>My mom was not with me.
    <br>She was out of the country, while 
    <br>I was alone with my brothers.
    <br>All of us, including my brothers, were from the same kingdom.
    <br>My mom was a queen in our kingdom,
    <br>while I was the princess.
    <br>She too was delivered in this church.
    <br>My mom was delivered from the spirit of water snake.
    <br>When the man of God was praying, a snake was inside me.
    <br>It was as if my stomach just opened and the snake just came out and
    <br>when the man of God said, "Holy Ghost Fire",
    <br>I saw the snake running out of the church and I was delivered.
    <br>Since then, I have had no dream or attack. I am free!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Wise Man Daniel valiantly removes the generational curses and demonic authorities
    <br>that are behind their failings and setbacks.
    <br>He continues throughout the congregation and encounters this woman.
    <br>She begins to manifest.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Daniel, I am the queen of all queens.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>Daniel, you should know all these things.
    <br>You know, I cannot open up.
    <br>This is the arena of liberty, Jesus is more than you.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>Let me ease myself first before I can talk.
    <br>What have you done to her before...
    <br>I am the queen of all queens and you know it.
    <br>Speak out! What have you done to her?
    <br>You know I'm the queen.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>I have destroyed her.
    <br>In what way?
    <br>Daniel, you know.
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>I will not!
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>I can't.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Come out of this body, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>This is a manifestation of the evil spirit.
    <br>Right now, she is not at ease with herself.
    <br>You are free. Rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>Open your eyes.
    <br>Am I drunk?
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>What are you doing here?
    <br>I'm not doing anything here. Nothing.
    <br>Nothing?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>So, you have forgotten that you have been abusing me.
    <br>I can't abuse you.
    <br>But you said you are the queen of the coast.
    <br>I can't be the queen of the coast.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. You are free.
    <br>Thank you. I'm sorry, Prophet.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Praise the Lord! Emmanuel!
    <br>(Matthew 1:23 - God is with us)
    <br>My name is Mrs Rita Ignatius Omero.
    <br>I'm a Nigerian living in Gabon.
    <br>What happened last week was that I came here for the normal Sunday worship.
    <br>I didn't come for any deliverance.
    <br>I was there when the man of God, Wise Man Daniel, came to me and he laid hands on me.
    <br>Before I knew it, the contrary spirit within me started manifesting,
    <br>confessing that I was a queen of queens.
    <br>This queen of queens all started in 2003, when I gave birth to my son.
    <br>I knew that I had a contrary spirit because
    <br>I was going from one church to another for deliverance.
    <br>There was even one church I went to in Gabon.
    <br>When they were in the deliverance section, and it reached my turn,
    <br>the man of God laid hands on me, and the contrary spirit in me gripped the man.
    <br>I wanted to strangle the man of God.
    <br>If it wasn't for the workers in the church, 
    <br>I don't know what would have happened.
    <br>I hit the man of God and beat him mercilessly.
    <br>Even the man of God came the next day to my husband, and asked him,
    <br>"How long have you been living with this woman?"
    <br>He said, "Please, sir, I don't want your wife coming to my church for deliverance again
    <br>because last night, the contrary spirit nearly finished my household".
    <br>That was how I stopped, but it continued.
    <br>Even when I slept in the night, my husband would lay his hands on me and pray for me.
    <br>When I woke up and saw him praying for me, the spirit in me would start manifesting.
    <br>At times my tongue would come out long like a snake.
    <br>My husband would run away and call the pastors.
    <br>When they came, everything would be settled and my husband would be embarrassed.
    <br>This thing was happening in my life all these years.
    <br>One day my son woke up in the morning and said,
    <br>"Mummy, please I don't want to call you by your name. I want to call you 'my queen'".
    <br>That was how he started calling me 'my queen'.
    <br>At a time, he stopped calling me 'my queen' and started calling me 'queen of all queens'.
    <br>Everywhere I went, people would call me 'queen of all queens'.
    <br>I did not know there was something attached to this 'queen of all queens' till last Sunday.
    <br>My husband has been passing through this all these years.
    <br>This thing has caused me sicknesses and has set my husband back.
    <br>Whenever my husband got a contract to work, he worked off shore,
    <br>whenever they called him for an appointment, due to this contrary spirit,
    <br>whenever my husband showed his face, they would reject my husband.
    <br>At times I would fight my husband when he was going to church.
    <br>Whenever I had a problem with my husband, the contrary spirit within me would beat my husband.
    <br>One time they beat my husband, and he could not turn his neck for four days.
    <br>Now you beat.
    <br>Because you are delivered, that's why you are saying that.
    <br>We agree that it was a contrary spirit.
    <br>Now you beat your husband.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Until last week, by the grace of God, I came here for a normal Sunday service.
    <br>God used Wise Man Daniel to deliver me.
    <br>Since last week, I've been sleeping well. I don't hear the sound of snakes anymore.
    <br>I don't have the fear of snakes anymore.
    <br>I don't have it in mind that I will see snakes everywhere I am going.
    <br>I'm free. I sleep well!
    <br>I thank God!  Emmanuel!
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>My husband is in Gabon.
    <br>Your husband is now a husband.
    <br>There is a wonderful name Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Rita Ignatius.
    <br>I'm from Nigeria but living in Gabon.
    <br>The girl beside me is my daughter,
    <br>Charity Ignatius.
    <br>She was a princess in my kingdom.
    <br>My brethren, I thank God for today. I thank God for what He has done in my family .
    <br>Many of you think that it's just a joke. It is not a joke.
    <br>I don't know how to start.
    <br>When the man of God was asking me to open up,
    <br>I said that I didn't want to open up
    <br>because I knew the reason.
    <br>I knew that my daughter would come back to fight for me.
    <br>It all happened when I came to The SCOAN
    <br>last year in April.
    <br>When I came, Wise Man Daniel touched me.
    <br>Wise Man Daniel provoked me.
    <br>The spirit in me was wildly provoked.
    <br>As God had it, he asked me a question,
    <br>"Who are you?"
    <br>I said, "I am the queen of all queens". And that was what I was.
    <br>Not a queen but queen of all queens; I controlled.
    <br>When he asked me, I didn't want to open up
    <br>because I knew where I was coming from
    <br>and I knew the disaster that would follow after my deliverance.
    <br>I stood on my words as I didn't want to open up.
    <br>I knew that my family would come for me.
    <br>Finally, the man of God, Wise Man Daniel, delivered me.
    <br>When he delivered me, I received a call
    <br>that my daughter was misbehaving at home.
    <br>I gave birth to them physically and spiritually.
    <br>When I travelled back to Gabon last week, I was watching Emmanuel TV because I didn't go to church.
    <br>I was feeling dizzy and said, "Let me pray with Emmanuel TV".
    <br>I was there when I saw my daughter. I said, "This girl resembles my daughter!"
    <br>I said, "Wow, God created two identical people in the world".
    <br>I said, "No, how can this girl resemble my daughter?"
    <br>She was wearing my daughter's earrings,
    <br>and I bought those clothes.
    <br>She has her own, and I have my own.
    <br>I said, "No! My daughter cannot come to The SCOAN without telling me!"
    <br>When I ran out because I was not
    <br>feeling comfortable, I phoned.
    <br>Somebody picked up her phone and said that it was my daughter that was manifesting there.
    <br>Myself - heat!
    <br>As I was breathing, I vibrated.
    <br>That was how I came down. I thank God
    <br>for delivering my family.
