    <br>SPECIAL NEW YEAR'S MESSAGE
    <br>from PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Viewers all over the world, there are many activities in this season.
    <br>Some celebrate this way, others that way
    <br>but we are here as children of God, born of God,
    <br>to celebrate in His presence.
    <br>In His presence, we are strong. Glory be to God.
    <br>Our message this season – 'Offence'.
    <br>Offence is the effective instrument used by satan to trap us,
    <br>to imprison us and make us bondservants.
    <br>We are here today to celebrate our Lord, Jesus. It's all about Jesus.
    <br>Just because you were mistreated,
    <br>just because you were wrongly accused or lied against,
    <br>you do not have permission or right to hold onto offence.
    <br>As we all know, offence is a trap of the enemy.
    <br>We are usually shocked, surprised and bewildered when offended,
    <br>as if we are the only one wronged.
    <br>Jesus made it abundantly clear:
    <br>It is impossible to live among people, to live this life
    <br>and not have the opportunity to be offended.
    <br>I mean, it is impossible that no offence should come.
    <br>It is not a question of opportunity to be offended but what your response will be.
    <br>Remember, our response determines our future.
    <br>Your response determines your future.
    <br>When I'm hurt, my response determines my future.
    <br>Expectation of certain behaviours from our dear ones sets us up for offence.
    <br>For instance, I'm expecting you to greet me
    <br>because I helped you and you ignore me.
    <br>This is one of the roots of offence.
    <br>This New Year, my brothers and sisters, expectation of certain behaviours
    <br>should carefully be observed.
    <br>I'm expecting this from you; I'm expecting that from you.
    <br>There is nothing bad about that but this should not lead to offence.
    <br>I want to greet you once again, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, the Lord said I should pray with you
    <br>after delivering the message and I want to pray with you.
    <br>Offence is the effective instrument used by satan to imprison us,
    <br>to entrap us and make us one of his own.
    <br>I want to pray with you.
    <br>Whatever caused by offence -
    <br>envy, jealousy, outrage, strifes, resentment, pain, hurts, deep hurts -
    <br>end with this year, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever caused by offence -
    <br>pain of the past, hatred, bitterness, envy, jealousy, isolation, depression -
    <br>end with this year, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free from whatever caused by offence!
    <br>I say, you are free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
    <br>I have a couple of things to introduce to you.
    <br>This is one of the blessings God has inspired me to give to you -
    <br>'Believer's Card'.
    <br>My prayer partner.
    <br>Your prayer partner – T.B. Joshua. I am your prayer partner.
    <br>This is a blessing for you with a seal of authentic authorisation.
    <br>I want to identify with you. We want to rededicate ourselves, our relationship,
    <br>and to let you know that I know you - you know me. Yes.
    <br>Viewers, thank you very much.
    <br>We want to prepare you in reading the prophecy for the year.
    <br>We have 3 parts, and I am going to read part 1.
    <br>Remaining parts 2 and 3 we leave for the next Sunday, or other Sunday.
    <br>Right now, I want to read the first part of the prophecy -
    <br>what you should expect next year.
    <br>I have to read it; it's an instruction from God.
    <br>It's purely Heaven; Heaven knows about this.
    <br>It came to me, I received it and the Lord said I should give you.
    <br>This is the Word of God.
    <br>SPECIAL NEW YEAR'S MESSAGE
    <br>from PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Viewers all over the world, before we start prayer,
    <br>I have with me the prophecy for the New Year.
    <br>There will be large scale scarcity, shortage of food.
    <br>As a state, country, continent, we have to go back to the farm to arrest the forthcoming situation.
    <br>Number 2:
    <br>Some countries will suffer excessive rainfall while others will suffer drought.
    <br>That means that some countries will have no rain, and if there is rain, it comes at the wrong time.
    <br>This is a prophecy for the whole world.
    <br>I encourage the governments of all nations to invest in agriculture
    <br>and to grant loans to deserving citizens to enhance this effort.
    <br>The continent of Africa – how much we have disappointed God.
    <br>Africa is supposed to be the breadbasket of the world.
    <br>We are supposed to produce a large sum of food for the whole world.
    <br>This is our natural resource base.
    <br>Food should be our primary export to other continents -
    <br>food in exchange for technology.
    <br>Let's go back to where we are coming from.
    <br>Let's go back to the promise of God we have abandoned.
    <br>Let's go back to our destiny.
    <br>Politics – African leaders should quickly arrest the political situation that is coming.
    <br>More African countries will be under siege by terrorists
    <br>because of pros and cons, for and against, in choosing leaders in their countries.
    <br>Mishandling of electoral processes will create a conducive atmosphere for terrorists.
    <br>Politics will not be business as usual because of limited resources.
    <br>There will be no profit in investing in politics
    <br>because of governments' limited resources and challenges.
    <br>This now gives grace to those who are genuinely called to the job.
    <br>When you are genuinely called to the job,
    <br>you will do it because of your love for it and not because of money.
    <br>This year, do what you love.
    <br>There is money in love.
    <br>Money in love brings peace and tranquillity.
    <br>Back to my country Nigeria and my president, President Buhari.
    <br>He has good intentions.
    <br>A king's intentions cannot be carried out properly without the support of the subjects.
    <br>He needs your support to lead us out of the valley.
    <br>We are in the valley.
    <br>Nigeria - we are in the valley.
    <br>I am not saying "valley of shadow of death" but I say "we are in the valley".
    <br>It is not our President who put us in the valley, it is a generational issue.
    <br>We have gradually been going into the valley.
    <br>The reality of that valley has come. We have seen, we are in the valley.
    <br>My country Nigeria – the president will do everything to reject revaluation of the naira,
    <br>which is a good idea from a good leader.
    <br>But there will be overwhelming pressure which he will not be able to resist.
    <br>No one can resist it.
    <br>As far as he is a human being, he will not be able to resist it.
    <br>There will be an overwhelming pressure from above him.
    <br>He will not be able to resist.
    <br>No one is to be blamed. Everyone has a portion to be blamed for.
    <br>If you are from Nigeria, you are to be blamed.
    <br>Let us share the blame and move the country forward.
    <br>Nigerians, let us support and pray for our leaders.
    <br>The future of this country is crying for help.
    <br>We are in the valley.
    <br>I am not saying "valley of shadow of death" - take note of that.
    <br>Press men, for your information; please quote me well. Thank you.
    <br>Being in a valley is different from being in a valley of shadow of death.
    <br>Valley means, there is a hill here.
    <br>There is a hill here; there is hill there.
    <br>But you are now trapped from coming out.
    <br>When you say "valley of shadow of death", you mean there is snake, python, lion, crocodile,
    <br>with you in the valley but our case is not like that.
    <br>We are in the valley but there is no crocodile, no lion, no tiger there.
    <br>We are just alone there.
    <br>But it is also very difficult because if you are in the valley, there is no food, no money.
    <br>Therefore, let us support our leaders, our president and pray for him.
    <br>We should pray for a North Korean leader this time.
    <br>But I'm not going to go into that because it is time to pray now.
    <br>Yes. My brothers and sisters, start your year on your knees.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Start your year on your knees".

    <br>Yes. As a Christian, God is our Rewarder.

    <br>As you lay your bed, you lie on it.
    <br>This is time for you to reconcile your way with the Lord.
    <br>In order for you to have Jesus Christ, you must let go of offence.
    <br>Let go of all hurt. Deep hurt – let go.
