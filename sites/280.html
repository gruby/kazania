    <br>As the evangelists continue to minister the anointing water to the congregation
    <br>the darkness in this woman's life was exposed by the light of God.
    <br>Try though it might, the demonic entity in her life could not withstand the power and armour of God,
    <br>working through the anointing water.
    <br>The Anointing Water Revival - Birmingham, UK
    <br>The woman was escorted to the front so that all could witness the power of Jesus' triumph
    <br>over the power of the devil in her life.
    <br>The battle between light and darkness was evident in the life of this woman,
    <br>as every chain that an enemy had used to draw her back was being broken, in the name above all names.
    <br>Watch how she received her freedom.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ! You evil spirit - it's time for you to speak out - who are you?
    <br>You say what?
    <br>There are many of us.
    <br>How many?
    <br>Many.
    <br>You must speak. How many?
    <br>Forty.
    <br>Begin to name yourselves. Who is number one?
    <br>Madness.
    <br>What is the meaning of that?
    <br>I destroyed her brain and made her go crazy.
    <br>I made her mad.
    <br>Who is number two?
    <br>I still want to speak.
    <br>Speak out. What have you done to her, madness?
    <br>She sees a psychiatrist, right now.
    <br>I wanted them to lock her up for life.
    <br>Why do you want them to lock her up for life?
    <br>Because I have tried to kill her; she won’t die. I tried to make her kill herself.
    <br>How did you try to make her kill herself?
    <br>She overdoses – tablets.
    <br>I have told her to jump off buildings.
    <br>She won’t. She prays, that is the problem.
    <br>Someone keeps on protecting her.
    <br>Who keeps protecting her?
    <br>You know who it is.
    <br>Who? Tell us.
    <br>I’m not telling you.
    <br>I will not utter that name.
    <br>Which name?
    <br>I will not utter that name.
    <br>But it's the name she prays to.
    <br>You know the name.
    <br>Don't ask me.
    <br>Who is number two?
    <br>Lust, seduction.
    <br>How many powers do you have in her body?
    <br>Many.
    <br>Where are the powers in her body?
    <br>You spirit of lust and seduction - where are the powers in her body?
    <br>In her hips.
    <br>Explain the power in her hips
    <br>And in her breasts.
    <br>You said you had power in her hips and in her breasts. Explain the power in her hips!
    <br>I came in after her father abused her.
    <br>So, that was how I came in.
    <br>I said - the power in her hips - how does she use the power in her hips?
    <br>She doesn’t have to do much. She only has to stand there and men come to her.
    <br>So, once men see her hips, they are attracted to her?
    <br>That’s right. They just use her.
    <br>She doesn’t have any power except in her hips for men to destroy her.
    <br>They use her. I made them use her.
    <br>And then, that’s when it hurts and then she goes crazy.
    <br>That’s what I want. I want her to go crazy and lose her mind.
    <br>How do you use her as a spirit of lust?
    <br>Get off me. Leave me alone. Let me go.
    <br>I said, what do you use her to do as a spirit of lust. What are the things she does as a spirit of lust?
    <br>How does it push her?
    <br>That lust makes her live in sin.
    <br>No matter how hard she tries, if she has lust, then she is still living in sin.
    <br>You mean that anyone who is living in sin and in lust - you can operate in them?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You demon, right now it is your time to leave this body.
    <br>You've made the greatest mistake by allowing her to come here.
    <br>However many you are, Jesus Christ is more than you.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ - it is your time to leave, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Come out of this body, and set her free!
    <br>Come out of her in Jesus' name!
    <br>Everything not of Jesus Christ - come out!
    <br>You have no place in this body. She belongs to Jesus Christ.
    <br>This anointing water is sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua. You must leave.
    <br>Whether you like it or not, you must go.
    <br>You are going to where Jesus wants you to go, but you must leave her! Come out!
    <br>Come out of her! Out!
    <br>You must leave. Get out of this body! Get out! Leave her alone! Go, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Deliverance Through the Anointing Water, in Jesus' Name
    <br>They are calling the name I don't want to hear.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Deliverance Through the Anointing Water, in Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name!
    <br>♪ Blood of Jesus
    <br>The blood of Jesus set me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The blood of Jesus set me free
    <br>Oh God, my life spent with you ♪
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ - you are declared free in Jesus' name! Rise to your feet.
    <br>Set Free Through the Anointing Water, in Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, sister?
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am OK, thanks.
    <br>I am just a bit dazed.
    <br>What just happened to you? Do you know what you were saying just now?
    <br>Not really. All I know is I felt the spray and from there, something came over me.
    <br>And right now - how are you feeling?
    <br>I feel at peace right now, with myself.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sister, you are declared free.
    <br>Go and live your life to follow Jesus and walk in the light of your testimony.
    <br>Thank you, so much!
    <br>I have suffered so much and it is good to know that I am free now!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>ANOINTING WATER REVIVAL IN BIRMINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM
    <br>ANOINTING WATER REVIVAL - TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Charlene. I am from Leicester - UK, originally born in Zimbabwe.
    <br>What was the problem that brought you to the Anointing Water Revival in Birmingham today?
    <br>I had constant torment, depression, chronic pain and sickness all the time.
    <br>I was in and out of the hospital with different illnesses, including mental health issues as well.
    <br>Can you explain the mental health issue you were having before?
    <br>Before – I had several issues - the impulse to cut myself, self-harm, suicide attempts.
    <br>I made several suicide attempts – overdoses and attempts like that.
    <br>Nasty stuff.
    <br>You said that you had suicidal thoughts, and you attempted suicide several times. Is that right?
    <br>Yes, that is right.
    <br>Constantly, I heard a voice telling me to kill myself. It nagged me.
    <br>If I was driving, it would say, “Drive into this wall”
    <br>or, “Go, jump off that building; you don’t deserve to live”.
    <br>It was a very negative voice.
    <br>Have you ever been hospitalized because of this problem?
    <br>Yes, I have.
    <br>I have been hospitalized, and I have seen a psychiatrist.
    <br>They tried their best in terms of treating me with medication.
    <br>I was on all the medication I needed to be on.
    <br>The medication and treatment - had that been able to put an end to the mental problem you were having?
    <br>No, not an end.
    <br>It just elevated my mood a bit.
    <br>It makes you feel a bit better.
    <br>It is just like a ...
    <br>The anti-psychotics worked really only for my mood but the problem didn't go away.
    <br>You mentioned that you made several suicide attempts.
    <br>Have you ever been hospitalized as a result of this?
    <br>Yes, many times.
    <br>I had been on life support in the past.
    <br>I had been in a coma because I attempted suicide.
    <br>I had to have my stomach pumped for the drugs to be taken out.
    <br>I was in hospital a couple of times, more than four times due to suicide attempts.
    <br>The last time was the worst.
    <br>I took about 60 tablets, 60 Tramadols.
    <br>I had a test that climbed to the scale of 3, which means I was clinically dead.
    <br>I was on life support and in a coma for a few days.
    <br>The doctors really thought I would die.
    <br>They left me on life support thinking that was it, they should just leave me
    <br>because I had stopped breathing for a few hours and they thought I would be brain-dead.
    <br>But somehow – it was God, really – I woke up.
    <br>A lot of people just die from brain damage but I woke up and I thank God for that.
    <br>They were shocked as well.
    <br>Amen. You said you were in a coma and on life support, you were clinically dead
    <br>but by the grace of God you came out of it. Is that right?
    <br>Yes, I did.
    <br>Is this what prompted you to seek for a solution from God Almighty?
    <br>I had always been a praying person but every time I tried to, there was a pattern.
    <br>Every time I tried to make my life right with God, I would get spiritual attacks.
    <br>I mean they are not just a ...
    <br>They had become physical as well.
    <br>One time, I got scratched in my eyes and couldn’t see for 48 hours.
    <br>Physical things like being thrown constantly around my room or my bed.
    <br>It was always a pattern.
    <br>When I started going to church and trying to live according to God’s will,
    <br>there were always issues that would come up.
    <br>I would start getting spiritual attacks, particularly with sickness.
    <br>What was it that was scratching your eyes and causing you to be thrown around the room?
    <br>It wasn’t just me; I have a sister as well. She got thrown up and down by it.
    <br>She called it a creature with goat’s legs and a weird face.
    <br>Could you see this creature?
    <br>I saw a shadow of it many times but she saw it.
    <br>But always, I felt it and it clawed me in my eyes.
    <br>Alright. You came to the Anointing Water Revival today with these challenges.
    <br>Can you tell us what happened when the Anointing Water was ministered to you?
    <br>When the Anointing Water was ministered, it felt stinging.
    <br>I just felt a sting and I felt like turning my head away.
    <br>I felt like leaving, like running away, basically.
    <br>I don’t know – that was not me because I was OK.
    <br>Something just came over me.
    <br>How did you feel at that time when the Anointing Water was being ministered to you?
    <br>It felt as if I was being stung by something; I just didn’t like it.
    <br>I wanted to go. It was as if something came over me; I wasn’t myself.
    <br>I was there but there was something inside of me that didn't like the Anointing Water.
    <br>At the end of the prayer - tell us what happened and how were you feeling.
    <br>After I came to back to my senses, I felt very light.
    <br>I feel like something has come out of me from deep inside.
    <br>I feel fresh air and that I can breathe now.
    <br>I actually enjoy breathing because it feels so good; praise God!
    <br>What do you believe Jesus Christ has done for you through the medium of the Anointing Water?
    <br>I believe Jesus Christ has shown immeasurable mercy to me
    <br>because of what I have been going through.
    <br>I have cried and cried in bed, asking Jesus why all that was happening to me all the time.
    <br>I would even say to Him, “I am so tired; I can’t wake up every morning like this”.
    <br>I would say to Him, “I know that suicide is a sin; I don’t want to go to hell.
    <br>If I die, I want to go and be with You, Jesus”. He answered my prayers.
    <br>Amen. Yes, the prayers of many years are not lost.
    <br>We thank God Almighty today for meeting you at the point of your need.
    <br>We thank God for shining the light of His life into your spirit, soul and body
    <br>and dispelling every shade of darkness in your spirit, in your soul, in your mind and in your body.
    <br>We encourage you to maintain this wonderful deliverance and a new life in Christ Jesus
    <br>by making God's Word the standard for your thoughts, your words, and your actions,
    <br>and it shall be well with you, day by day and hour by hour, till we are glorified at last in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus!
