    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>This woman came to The SCOAN bleeding from her mouth and nose,
    <br>due to a ruptured nasal artery.
    <br>It was a devastating condition.
    <br>The blood clots around her nose and mouth
    <br>show that this has indeed been a prolonged condition.
    <br>Her breathing was also affected as she was forced to breathe through her mouth.
    <br>You can see the bowl full of blood-drenched cotton wool,
    <br>the blood flowing from her mouth preventing her from speaking to reduce the blood loss.
    <br>Let's hear from her husband.
    <br>My name is Sima Imma, I'm from Edo State.
    <br>I am 38 years old.
    <br>We are seeing a woman sitting beside you.
    <br>Can you tell us who is she to you?
    <br>The woman sitting beside me is my wife.
    <br>Can you tell us what is the problem that brought you and your wife to The SCOAN today?
    <br>The problem that brought us to The SCOAN is bleeding from the nose and mouth.
    <br>How has this problem affected your life, as a husband?
    <br>It affected my life because I can't go to my work anymore.
    <br>Not only that, I'm the one bathing her and doing everything.
    <br>She cannot even go to the toilet. If she wants to go to the toilet, it's a problem.
    <br>If she wants to eat, it's a problem.
    <br>We have suffered a lot.
    <br>We went to many places.
    <br>We went to the hospital and she spent four days but there was no solution.
    <br>On Tuesday, the doctor discharged her from the hospital.
    <br>And now that you are at The SCOAN, what do you believe Jesus Christ will do for your wife?
    <br>I believe the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua will heal her.
    <br>Amen. We pray and believe with you that God Almighty will heal your wife from the problem of bleeding
    <br>from mouth and nose, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Here is Mrs Rosemary Imma bleeding profusely from the mouth and nose
    <br>due to the raptured nasal artery.
    <br>You can see the blood pouring into the bowl.
    <br>You need to see what I'm looking at.
    <br>You just need to see what I'm looking at.
    <br>I want you to look - watch your screen.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>The blood continued gushing out of her mouth and nose unabated.
    <br>It was almost like a tap was running.
    <br>There was nothing she could do to stop the horrific bleeding.
    <br>My Jesus can do it; He can heal.
    <br>He will give you succour today and He will deliver you.
    <br>I pray, you will be able to maintain the blessing.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Viewers at home, watch your screen.
    <br>Never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Whether you are close or far,
    <br>the lightning of God - thunder cannot stand it.
    <br>We call it resurrection power.
    <br>So right now, Jesus says she will be healed.
    <br>Receive you healing, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Right now the resurrection power of Jesus is flowing from Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to heal Mrs Rosemary Imma.
    <br>There is never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>She's free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I'm free!
    <br>That was all it took; with just a tap of God's fingers, she was completely healed.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Rosemary Imma, I'm from Edo State.
    <br>I stay in Bayelsa.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband.
    <br>This brother is my older brother and the other one is my younger brother.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a ruptured nasal artery;
    <br>I was bleeding from my nose and mouth for eight days.
    <br>My husband took me to the hospital.
    <br>When I got to the hospital, the doctor began to treat me and put me on a drip.
    <br>The more the doctor treated me, the more I bled and it could not stop.
    <br>I started crying, "My husband, please help me. I have no strength anymore."
    <br>For eight days, I had been bleeding.
    <br>I could not eat or sleep.
    <br>I couldn't look after my children.
    <br>I started crying but that could not solve my problem.
    <br>I said, "Please, take me to The SCOAN."
    <br>The doctor had already asked me to leave as he would not treat me again
    <br>because the blood was too much.
    <br>They discharged me and asked me to pack out.
    <br>My husband took me to Lagos after midnight, around 2 o'clock.
    <br>Early in the morning, on Thursday, he took me to The SCOAN and the workers helped me.
    <br>I was still bleeding non-stop until I entered the prayer line.
    <br>I was sitting down at the prayer line when the man of God came
    <br>and stretched his right hand towards me and said, "Receive your healing."
    <br>I said, "Amen!"
    <br>The moment I said, "Amen", the bleeding stopped just like that.
    <br>HORRIFIC: A Bloody Miracle!
    <br>Before I came to The SCOAN, I went to another church; everybody started crying.
    <br>They said they didn't know what to do about it.
    <br>I said, "I don't want to die. Please, help me. I have nowhere to go."
    <br>I couldn't sleep.
    <br>After the prayer on Thursday, I went back to the place we were staying at.
    <br>I slept like a baby until the next morning without any pain or bleeding.
    <br>HORRIFIC: A Bloody Miracle!
    <br>As you can see now, there is no blood in my nose anymore.
    <br>Before, I could not bend down like this; I always had to raise my head up
    <br>but the blood kept coming out.
    <br>Now, I can bend and turn around.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>HORRIFIC: A Bloody Miracle!
    <br>That is the wonderful testimony you have heard from Mrs Rosemary Imma.
    <br>She is here today with her husband and members of her family
    <br>to testify to the goodness of God in her life, having been saved from death.
    <br>She said the problem that brought her to The SCOAN was the problem
    <br>of severe bleeding from the nose and the mouth as the result of a ruptured artery.
    <br>She said this problem was for eight days and on the eighth day,
    <br>when she came to The SCOAN, she was bleeding non-stop.
    <br>Before she was brought to The SCOAN, her husband had taken her to many places
    <br>in search of solution; all to no avail,
    <br>including hospital where treatments were applied,
    <br>but the more the treatment, the more the bleeding continued.
    <br>And she said because of that she could not bend down.
    <br>If she bent down, the bleeding would be flowing out like a tap.
    <br>And she said she had lost strength.
    <br>And she said after much effort by the doctors, they could find no solution,
    <br>they discharged her and her husband rushed her to The SCOAN on her request.
    <br>She said when she came to The SCOAN and she was placed at the prayer line on Thursday,
    <br>the anointed man of God from a distance only stretched his hand towards her,
    <br>while she was still bleeding seriously.
    <br>She said as the man of God stretched forth his hand towards her and said, "Be healed in Jesus' name",
    <br>she shouted "Amen" and at that "Amen" the bleeding stopped.
    <br>Since then she can sleep very well.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Sima Imma.
    <br>We are from Edo State but we reside in Bayelsa.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>was that my wife had a ruptured nose artery.
    <br>She was bleeding from her nose and mouth for eight days.
    <br>When the bleeding started, I took her to the hospital.
    <br>We were there without any solution.
    <br>On Wednesday, the doctor went to call another doctor to see her because the blood did not stop.
    <br>They put her on a drip and drugs but the blood kept pouring out.
    <br>Every day, she bled continuously until we went to the prayer line.
    <br>The man of God came out and stretched his hand towards her, prayed for her
    <br>and said, "Madam, you are free."
    <br>On that very day, she slept like a baby.
    <br>Now, my wife is free. Praise the Lord!
    <br>Thank you. Can I just ask your wife a question?
    <br>When you heard "Be healed, in the name of Jesus" and you said "Amen",
    <br>how did you feel in your body?
    <br>I was shocked.
    <br>My throat and everything became dry.
    <br>I started swallowing my saliva.
    <br>Before, I could not swallow anything at all.
    <br>When I was still bleeding, the baby in my womb could not move.
    <br>I started crying and said, "I cannot feel my baby anymore."
    <br>Since I received my healing on Thursday, my baby is doing fine.
    <br>While the bleeding was coming, the baby stopped moving -
    <br>she could not feel anything in her womb because the baby was enjoying the same blood;
    <br>as she was affected, the thing affected the baby, and the baby stopped breathing.
    <br>Immediately after the healing, she was given succour and the baby started kicking as the bleeding stopped.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Mrs Rosemary Imma came back to The SCOAN for a second time,
    <br>holding her baby in her arms to testify to the glory of God,
    <br>that after the bleeding from the ruptured artery in her nose stopped,
    <br>she was able to deliver her baby without any complications.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Imma Rosemary.
    <br>I am from Edo State but I reside in Bayelsa State.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>The woman beside my husband is my mother-in-law.
    <br>The other lady is my sister-in-law.
    <br>The other brother is my brother-in-law.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was a ruptured nose artery.
    <br>I was bleeding through nose and mouth.
    <br>When I was bleeding, my husband took me to the hospital.
    <br>I was there without solution - I was still bleeding.
    <br>The more the doctor put me on a drip, the more the blood came out.
    <br>I did not know what to do, I was just crying.
    <br>I was at the point of death by then.
    <br>After three or four days, the doctor wrote a transfer letter to my husband.
    <br>I had nowhere to go.
    <br>I started crying, "Oh God, help me."
    <br>My husband told me to stop crying but he was also crying.
    <br>He rushed me to Lagos from Bayelsa State around 2 o'clock.
    <br>Early in the morning, they rushed me to The SCOAN; it was an emergency.
    <br>Immediately the man of God came out, he stretched his right hand towards me.
    <br>He said, "Receive your healing" and I said, "Amen."
    <br>The moment I said, "Amen", the bleeding ceased.
    <br>Wow. Hallelujah!
    <br>Madam, you mean that immediately the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>stretched his hand and prayed for you,
    <br>the bleeding that we saw coming from your mouth and nose,
    <br>that we can see on the screen right now that was filling that bowl, stopped immediately?
    <br>Yes, the bleeding stopped immediately.
    <br>I was not bleeding anymore.
    <br>Glory be to God. And since that day, how have you been and how are you feeling now?
    <br>I'm fine, now.
    <br>When I was bleeding, my baby was not moving anymore.
    <br>If the baby moved, it was only a little bit.
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me, I received my healing.
    <br>My baby started moving and I became hungry.
    <br>Before then, I could not even drink water, talkless of food.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Not only did she receive her healing from the ruptured nasal artery,
    <br>which caused the bleeding through her nose and mouth,
    <br>she also received her appetite back and her child also received strength
    <br>and was able to move inside her womb.
    <br>So tell us then, since that time, how have you been and how was the time of giving birth to your child.
    <br>Since that time, I don't bleed anymore.
    <br>In November, I was eight months pregnant.
    <br>I gave birth in December; I delivered safely - no operation.
    <br>I was no longer bleeding and I delivered safely.
    <br>I am here today to thank God and the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Hallelujah. A million thanks are not enough.
    <br>Tell us now, what is the name of your child.
    <br>The name of my child is Emmanuel.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Indeed God is with us through His Word and by His Spirit.
    <br>Madam, we want to hear a word of advice from you,
    <br>to advise the viewers watching you all over the world concerning the power of God.
    <br>OK, my advice:
    <br>Anybody who is in this condition, don't give up; run to God.
    <br>The God that healed and delivered me will also heal and deliver you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for the miracle-working God.
    <br>That is wonderful. Right now, we'd love to hear from the husband.
    <br>We can see many of her family members followed her for the testimony today,
    <br>but because of time we will just listen to the husband.
    <br>Sir, you are welcome. Introduce yourself please and tell us your joy at this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Sima Imma.
    <br>The woman sitting beside me is my wife.
    <br>This is my mum.
    <br>These are my younger sister and brother.
    <br>I have to thank the man of God for what he has done in my life
    <br>and for saving me and my family last year in October.
    <br>The problem that brought us here was a ruptured nose artery.
    <br>She was bleeding from her mouth and nose severely.
    <br>When it started, I took her to the hospital for days without any solution.
    <br>They came and discharged us; they said we should go home.
    <br>At that time, my wife was crying, "What will happen to me?"
    <br>We were there for a long time and suddenly, they discharged us.
    <br>The bleeding had not yet stopped.
    <br>The little you saw was just some of the bleeding.
    <br>When we were at the clinic, they hated us because the blood stained everywhere.
    <br>When we came here, we had the opportunity to go to the prayer line.
    <br>The man of God came out and stretched his right hand towards her.
    <br>He said, "Receive healing. In Jesus' name, you are healed."
    <br>Immediately, the blood stopped.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Before then, she could not eat anything
    <br>but that very day, when we got home, I bought her rice, she finished it and asked me to buy extra.
    <br>That very night, she slept like a baby.
    <br>I wondered which type of God T.B. Joshua has.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus for that!
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>That day we went home.
    <br>When she was about to deliver this baby, she called me on the phone around 9pm.
    <br>She said she was having waist pain but there was no sign of labour.
    <br>I told her to meet the doctor to find out why she was having pain.
    <br>When she got there that night,
    <br>they said all doctors and nurses were on strike; there was nobody to attend to her.
    <br>A lady said that she knew one of the nurses
    <br>and that she should meet the nurse at her house.
    <br>Immediately she told me that, I knelt down and prayed, "God of T.B. Joshua, finish Your work."
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>I took the Anointing Water, took her picture
    <br>and sprayed her forehead and stomach.
    <br>Immediately, my phone rang again.
    <br>I asked, "What is the problem?" She said, "I have delivered a baby boy!"
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>As we can see, distance is not a barrier to the power of God Almighty. Amen?
    <br>So sir, let's hear from you - what is your word of advice
    <br>for what God Almighty has done in your life and the live of your wife.
    <br>My advice to viewers all over the world is to experience God. Praise the Lord.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God. We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>We can see the rest of your family, they also want to say something
    <br>but because of time we have to bring this testimony to a close.
    <br>We want to advise you all that as long as you continue to make God's Word the standard for your life,
    <br>you will continue to cross the bridge of every adversity that comes on your way.
    <br>Make God's Word the standard for your life and let love lead, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
