  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you are under the influence of my voice.
    <br>Where can we go from His voice?
    <br>I know you are there for God's promises.
    <br>He is faithful; He is not a man. When He says, "Yes", His 'Yes' is 'Yes'.
    <br>If He has not promised anything, how can we believe or have faith in Him?
    <br>He must promise something; that is why you are there.
    <br>He loves you and He is concerned about you.
    <br>He is your strength - when you are weak, you are strong.
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>Whatever situation you are in, never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Never a problem Jesus cannot solve.
