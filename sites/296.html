  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>we know you are with us, and we are with you.
    <br>We just want you to know that
    <br>Jesus loves you, just as He loves all of His Apostles.
    <br>Wherever you are, whatever situation you are in,
    <br>I say to satan, loose your grip.
    <br>Satan must loose his grip on you.
    <br>Whatever situation you are - are you sick?
    <br>Whatever name they call that sickness - never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>All knees shall bow.
    <br>I say to satan in your life, bow.
    <br>Bow, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you satan, leave my people!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, leave my people!
    <br>I can hear you free!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough in your business.
    <br>I can hear breakthrough in your system.
    <br>Every dead faculty in your system, rise again!
    <br>Be it your bones, muscles, fluid, blood, all your faculties - rise again!
    <br>Rise again!
    <br>Let there be light!
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Say to your business, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Say to your finances, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Say to your faculties, "Good Morning!"
    <br>My marital life, "Good Morning!"
    <br>My nation, "Good Morning!"
    <br>It is a new dawn!
    <br>SATAN, BOW IN THE NAME OF JESUS!
