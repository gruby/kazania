  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, if you honestly examine your heart in light of God's Word,
    <br>you will discover that there is a spirit of unforgiveness, a spirit of anger,
    <br>a spirit of bitterness, a spirit of jealousy, a spirit of envy
    <br>and such a spirit breaks our communion with God, our relationship with God.
    <br>It opens the door to whatever situation you are in now.
    <br>You say, "I have sickness."  What is the root of sickness? Unforgiveness.
    <br>Hardship - what is the root of hardship? Envy, jealousy, anger.
    <br>That is the route, the road to get to you.
    <br>Are you sick, facing hardship, poverty, loneliness, rejection?
    <br>Whatever you are facing, the route of those things is unforgiveness, envy, jealousy, bitterness.
    <br>These are the routes.
    <br>You don't need the enemy to attack you; once you have these, you have attacked yourself.
    <br>Unforgivingness, envy, jealousy, bitterness, strife, and hatred
    <br>open the door to whatever you are in.
    <br>I release you from the pain of the past.
    <br>I release you from that unforgiving spirit, that bitterness, envy, jealousy.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>Father, release your children, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Release Your children, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>Every unclean spirit in your career,
    <br>every unclean spirit in your life,
    <br>every unclean spirit - leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>God has spoken - rejoice!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>I cover you with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>I seal you with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Be covered with the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Begin a new life!
    <br>A new beginning!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>A new beginning is a new life,
    <br>a new direction,
    <br>a new way.
    <br>A new beginning!
    <br>A new beginning, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
    <br>I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>God has spoken, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I can sense God's healing touching you.
    <br>I can sense God's deliverance touching you, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Hear this: God has spoken!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name.
