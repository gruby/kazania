  <p>    
    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua together, in the name of Jesus, can stop satan killing, stealing
    <br>and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen right now; engage with God!
    <br>Viewers at home, listen to me.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, satan is behind it.
    <br>Whatever authority, every demonic authority satan has over you,
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever satan uses to connect you to himself,
    <br>be it sickness, disease, affliction, limitation in progress,
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, say after me:
    <br>I am free, healed, delivered, blessed!
    <br>Defeat and failures are things of the past!
    <br>Sickness and disease, infirmities are things of the past!
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Power to heal, deliver, set free in Jesus' name.
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirt and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God, as you send your testimony.
