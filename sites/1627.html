  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I've been looking at you since morning.
    <br>You have used every faculty of your body to dance.
    <br>You've used this one to dance.
    <br>This one is tired.
    <br>This one is tired too.
    <br>This one is tired. What again? Head.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The Word of God is everything.
    <br>It has the power to quicken us spiritually.
    <br>And I know you are very very spiritual now.
    <br>You can see beyond T.B. Joshua.
    <br>If you don't see beyond me, you are not here.
    <br>You need to see beyond me to understand what is happening here.
    <br>If it is this body you are looking at, you are not seeing.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "If this body, this appearance you're just seeing, you have not seen anything."
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[If this body, this appearance you're just seeing, you have not seen anything.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[If this body, this appearance you're just seeing, you have not seen anything.]
    <br>You continue to see yourself,
    <br>but to really see what you are here for, you need to be spiritual.
    <br>You have seen the Word of God working in the Spirit.
    <br>The name working in the Spirit, "In the name of Jesus" - did you see what happened?
    <br>I saw a woman after the deliverance;
    <br>she was looking, imagining what might have happened.
    <br>I was just sitting...
    <br>"Ah, ah, my husband would be looking at me at home.
    <br>And my husband never knew that I'm here.
    <br>But now see me. All what I have said, I never even knew... Ah, ah, ah."
    <br>It was later she said, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>That is the Word of God for you.
    <br>It has the ability to quicken us spiritually.
    <br>Let's just look at the text; that is John 6:63.
    <br>"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.
    <br>The words I have spoken to you - they are full of the Spirit and life."
    <br>That is, the Words we have been listening to since morning, they are full of the Spirit and life.
    <br>That is the Word of God.
    <br>Since the Word of God is Spirit and life, your life has to depend on it.
    <br>To be a Christian and to continue growing as a Christian,
    <br>your life has to depend on the Word of God.
    <br>How can our life depend on the Word of God?
    <br>How do we have faith?
    <br>By paying attention as if our lives depend on it.
    <br>When your life depends on something, you will switch on your heart to it.
    <br>When you are desperate to get a contract, you switch off your handset;
    <br>even when people are calling you, you will not pick it until you get that contract.
    <br>After getting the contract you will switch it on.
    <br>You'll now say, "Hello. Hi. Help me to thank God".
    <br>You switch on your heart to the Word of God because your life depends on it.
    <br>No other life, no other way - the Word of God.
    <br>The same Word of God you have been seeing since morning
    <br>doing the healing, deliverance - you have seen all what has happened today.
    <br>You should not let each Word go without you understanding it.
    <br>They say, "Jesus" - what does that mean?
    <br>Because your life depends on knowing it.
    <br>Don't let each Word go without you understanding it.
    <br>Faith does not originate in ourselves.
    <br>No wonder faith cannot be found when we examine our life.
    <br>"Where is faith?" - it is not possible.
    <br>When we examine our daily lives, we can find out how much faith we have.
    <br>When you examine your daily life, you can find out how much faith you have,
    <br>how much you believe God.
    <br>You can know if you are a Christian - it is only we are deceiving ourselves.
    <br>You sit down, "Am I a Christian?" - you don't need to ask anybody,
    <br>you can know if you are a Christian.
    <br>You know what has happened to you.
    <br>Because your business prospers, it does not mean you are a Christian.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>The kind of peace that comes determines where your effort comes from.
    <br>A Christian - because you are a rich man...
    <br>The kind of peace that comes determines where your breakthrough comes from.
    <br>Today, when you see someone with breakthrough, money, everything,
    <br>you say, "God has answered this man".
    <br>No.
    <br>You have forgotten what the Bible says in the Book of John 14:27.
    <br>Let's go to the Book of John.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives..."
    <br>That means the the world can give the peace.
    <br>People of the world can give peace, even healing, whatever you call it;
    <br>breakthrough you are looking for - they can give you breakthrough.
    <br>Listen to what the Bible says here:
    <br>"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives..."
    <br>It means the world can give peace.
    <br>How can you have breakthrough, be rich and everything and there is no peace?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take note:
    <br>Your business can prosper, yet, you are not a Christian.
    <br>The kind of peace that comes determines where your prosperity comes from.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God is all knowing.
    <br>Don't look at others that prosper.
    <br>You too, you are running to be prosperous.
    <br>What kind of prosperity are you talking about?
    <br>Prosperity without peace?
    <br>Breakthrough without peace?
    <br>Success without peace?
    <br>These are the challenges you are facing as a Christian.
    <br>You allow your situation to rule you, to disturb you because it is difficult for you,
    <br>you believe you are not a Christian.
    <br>Whereas, that difficulty can be used to preserve you,
    <br>to prepare you, to strengthen your desire and your determination for God.
    <br>It is not yet over.
    <br>I'm here in your presence and you know me very well - you know my antecedent.
    <br>You know the kind of war I have fought in the past, compared to the wars you have fought.
    <br>Now, begin to compare yourself to T.B. Joshua; what you have gone through in life.
    <br>Forget about your age.
    <br>What you have gone through - what I have gone through.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can't look for peace where there is no peace.
    <br>You believe here is a refuge where you can run to - that is why you are here.
    <br>It means there is peace.
    <br>OK, let me run to your place too for refuge.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have been sitting since morning -
    <br>count the number of people that say, "Ah, thank you".
    <br>They are being in bondage and here they are released.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Ah, I can breathe now. Ah, I can eat now. Ah, I can see now and nothing in exchange, money."
    <br>Freedom - as it was given to us, so we give it.
    <br>Freely we are given and freely we give.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask yourself whether you filled any form at the gate.
    <br>When you were asked to give your offering - were they telling you you must give certain offering,
    <br>or your neighbour knows what you have given?
    <br>That is the way it should be.
    <br>That is the life of faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are so much concerned about you.
    <br>We want to make sure you leave here with abundant life, abundant blessing.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you leave here, you will continue that life - give.
    <br>Be a good giver, irrespective of religion.
    <br>First, love.
    <br>You should be known by your love because faith cannot work without love
    <br>and love cannot work without faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be known by your love."
    <br>I can't hear you; tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Be known by your love.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Be known by your love.]
    <br>Because only faith pleases God and faith cannot work without love
    <br>and love cannot work without faith.
    <br>"I am a Christian" - that is not the name of God; the name of God is Love.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is the name of God?
    <br>[Love.]
    <br>How many people have you tried to help today with all your heart?
    <br>Love will expect you to sit and look around you - whom to help, whom to care for,
    <br>whom you think will need your help.
    <br>Look around again; look at your back, look at your front - whom to care for,
    <br>whom to ask questions.
    <br>After leaving, you ask, "Madam, I have been seeing you since morning - you were sitting at my back
    <br>and your mood was not quite friendly.
    <br>I mean, I'm sorry."
    <br>"Oh, no. I don't have transport back home. I have some challenges I need to see the man of God for."
    <br>Love looks around to see whom to help, whom to care for.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Love looks around to see whom to help, whom to care for.]
    <br>It is a risk in our generation now - very risky,
    <br>but what is worth to live for is also worth to risk for.
    <br>If something is worth to live for, it is worth to risk for.
    <br>It is very risky to look around and see whom to help, but you have to take that risk
    <br>because you are a soldier of God.
    <br>Take this home.
    <br>No matter how great your faith, without love, it is zero.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No matter how great your faith, without love, it is zero."
    <br>Ask yourself, "How many people have you helped today?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>I know what your neighbour says, "I'm in the church, I cannot help you.
    <br>When I get home, I will help."
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Hallelujah. 
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Where is your faith? - ask your neighbour.
    <br>Let's start this way:
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives.
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives.]
    <br>OK, what is the meaning of that?
    <br>How do you manifest your faith in the small things?
    <br>What is that small thing in our daily lives?
    <br>Can somebody tell me?
    <br>OK, let me give you a good example of what I'm talking about.
    <br>See: a small thing.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I want to comb my hair - "Thank You, Jesus. Amen."
    <br>We must know how much we need God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need faith to sit, to stand, to turn your neck, to look up, to comb your hair;
    <br>you even need faith to greet.
    <br>But you just need faith for healing - that is you.
    <br>Breakthrough.
    <br>"Man of God, my business is not going well. I need faith."
    <br>"Man of God, I have pain."
    <br>"God, I need business..."
    <br>You must know how much you need God to wear your dress, to greet, to walk.
    <br>You need faith to run, to enter your vehicle, to drive.
    <br>You need faith.
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives.
    <br>Unless you start this way, you cannot be a woman or man of faith.
    <br>You must start somewhere.
    <br>You must learn the alphabet to be able to pronounce and study.
    <br>You must go through the primary, secondary to university.
    <br>That is the issue of faith, the issue of God.
    <br>You must know how much you need God.
    <br>You need God to talk, to sit, to cough.
    <br>"In Jesus' name. Thank You, God".
    <br>I want to button up, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" means it is God that is buttoning up.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" to comb your hair, it means what?
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" to iron your dress means...
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" to sit means...
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" to stand...
    <br>That is the meaning.
    <br>Give all glory and credit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your case is this way:
    <br>See the door - you don't need God to open it, you can do it.
    <br>What you can do yourself - you say, "Oh no, I will do it".
    <br>Now, you want to come out - you don't need God, you open the door - that is you,
    <br>until you know that you need God to open the door -
    <br>then, you can need Him to jump here.
    <br>Here you cannot jump.
    <br>When you want to jump, you say, "Emmanuel..."
    <br>You exercise.
    <br>"In Jesus' name."
    <br>Until you know you need God to open this door, then you can need God to jump.
    <br>OK, can you exercise this now?
    <br>You want to go on your seat; you need God, you say, "Thank You, Jesus",
    <br>you stand up - "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Let's start it now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Start this and it will be well with you.
    <br>When you get to your vehicle and you are about to open the door, "Thank You, Jesus",
    <br>sitting to start your vehicle, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Not only when you are facing an accident and your vehicle is about to somersault,
    <br>you say, "Jesus! Emmanuel TV!"
    <br>Emmanuel TV is now "god", when you find yourself in a situation beyond you.
    <br>God will begin to work for you when you begin to know how much you need Him.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" means He is the One doing it and He will do it perfectly.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Greet your neighbour and say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Yes!
    <br>As you greet your neighbour, you say, "Thank You, Jesus for giving me the grace to greet."
    <br>That is it!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for that grace.
    <br>If you are with me here, let me see your hand.
    <br>It is not a joke, this is the life I live.
    <br>That is why if some of you are lucky to get me on the line,
    <br>you will see when you are talking, I pause.
    <br>At that moment I'm saying, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>"Hello. OK, sir, I would like to speak to you" - I pause, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>"Hello."
    <br>He is my strength, He is my life.
    <br>Without Him, I am finished.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "He is my strength, my joy, my life. Without Him, I am finished."
    <br>That is it!
    <br>Look at my brother with this big agbada (gown) now - so beautiful.
    <br>Next week I want to wear this gown.
    <br>I just admire you.
    <br>But you need Jesus to wear this agbada (gown)
    <br>and you need Jesus to remove it.
    <br>If not, it will be too heavy for you.
    <br>You just remove it, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>As you are saying that, you acknowledge the Father.
    <br>Acknowledgment is a great thing.
    <br>It is not possible for you to continue pretending acknowledging
    <br>to wear your dress, to comb your hair, to greet, to eat.
    <br>You don't need to say, "In the name of Jesus", just say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>"Thank You" is OK - it solves the problem.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" and you will see what will happen next.
    <br>The great thing, the difficulty you are facing and you want Him to do -
    <br>first, acknowledge Him in the small things.
    <br>Anytime you are facing challenges, then, He will listen to you.
    <br>Even doing things you don't need Him to do - let Him know He is the One doing them.
    <br>You see people saying, "T.B. Joshua does not have speaking skills".
    <br>I need to call Jesus before I say a word - in my heart.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord! Amen!"
    <br>It is difficult for me to do that.
    <br>When I say, "In Jesus' name", I need to say "Thank You, Jesus" on my own.
    <br>"Be healed!", I pause, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You don't know this, but this is my secret.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When I start now, "Be healed, in the name of Jesus!", I pause,
    <br>I say, "Thank You, Jesus for giving me the grace to call Your name".
    <br>It is not the issue of, "Be healed! Be delivered! Amen".
    <br>What is all this?
    <br>Acknowledgment.
    <br>Not mine not mine the choice
    <br>Not mine not mine
    <br>Not mine the choice
    <br>In things both great and small
    <br>Be Thou my Guide my Strength
    <br>My Wisdom my All
    <br>That is all.
    <br>Acknowledgment.
    <br>Look at what happened to David, when he was called to face Goliath.
    <br>Listen to what he said.
    <br>He mentioned his antecedent when he was a cattle rearer.
    <br>Acknowledgment is the answer to your situation.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Can somebody give us a lecture for one minute, before we proceed?
    <br>From what we learned today, we should always concentrate on Jesus in our hearts,
    <br>thanking Him daily in everything we do
    <br>because in the little-little ways we concentrate on Him.
    <br>That will determine how big we can receive Him in our heart.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Faith is manifested in the small things in our daily lives.
    <br>The Word of God has the ability to develop a force within our heart called faith.
    <br>I don't need to say it out, but I want to say it, so that you will know what I mean.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>You will soon be pregnant of Jesus.
    <br>That is the secret.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the greatest name - the only name that can scare all your enemies and send them away.
    <br>Whether you mean it or not, try it - begin now
    <br>and see whether it will not turn to reality.
    <br>It will become a reality.
    <br>You will find the Spirit of God begin to defend you, be there for you.
    <br>We are about to enter the new year - enough is enough.
    <br>What you are going through in the hands of the enemy is a mess.
    <br>You deserve excellence.
    <br>Many people out there that say they are Christians,
    <br>they cannot actually say emphatically that they are Christians because of what they are going through.
    <br>You will sleep, masquerade will chase you - a lot of nonsense.
    <br>"Are you a Christian?" - that is the question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>Enough is enough.
    <br>The kind of peace that comes determines where your prosperity comes from,
    <br>where your breakthrough comes from,
    <br>where your success comes from.
    <br>Face your neighbour:
    <br>The kind of peace that comes determines where your breakthrough,
    <br>where your success come from.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>The kind of peace that comes determines what you are proud of.
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>Amen
    <br>He has risen from the dead
    <br>He is Lord
    <br>Every knee shall bow
    <br>Every tongue confess
    <br>That Jesus Christ is Lord
    <br>We pause now.
    <br>What should be going on in your heart - "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>You don't need to see what to thank Him for before saying, "Thank You"
    <br>and see what will happen next.
    <br>You move, walk, smile, greet, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Even if there is a situation before you - "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Difficult time before you - "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>You receive a very bad phone call, you say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>He will take care.
    <br>He likes thanks.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Say, "Jesus likes thanks".
    <br>He likes it so much.
    <br>Open your mouth to say, "Thank You" for Him.
    <br>Your heart should be full of thanks.
    <br>Thanks
    <br>We give You thanks
    <br>For all You have done
    <br>We are so blessed
    <br>Our souls have found rest
    <br>Oh Lord we give You thanks
    <br>Thanks
    <br>We give You thanks
    <br>For all You have done
    <br>We are so blessed
    <br>Our souls have found rest
    <br>Oh Lord we give You thanks
    <br>This is the habit you need to cultivate now.
    <br>Habit is a gift from God.
    <br>Sometimes you go on your knees, begin to say, "God, do this for me..."
    <br>Thanks settles the whole thing.
    <br>"Give me bread, biscuit..." - because you don't know what to say.
    <br>He is your Creator, He knows you more than yourself.
    <br>If you say He should give you this, it is like He doesn't know His responsibility.
    <br>"Thanks" has settled the whole thing.
    <br>When you cultivate this 24/7 - "thanks" in your heart, you are praying.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You are praying".
    <br>Yes!
    <br>A break in faith is a break in God.
    <br>You have to walk by faith 24/7, "Thanks. Thank You, Lord!" - you are praying.
    <br>"Thank You, Lord."
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>I'm supposed to meet you in prayer.
    <br>Now, I say, "In Jesus' name" because you have been praying, "Thank You, Lord"  - your heart is saying it.
    <br>That's why I say, "In Jesus' name".
    <br>But you are not always in prayer mood.
    <br>You are not always in an attitude of prayer;
    <br>this is why the enemy can catch you unprepared.
    <br>Anything can happen to you just like that.
    <br>When I'm going, walking on the street, you meet me, you challenge me,
    <br>you know I'm not walking alone because I pray all the time.
    <br>I'm going, you see me going.
    <br>Sometimes you say, "T.B. Joshua".
    <br>Before I answer you, "Hey, how are you?" - because I'm busy.
    <br>See me.
    <br>But you - when you are going, you just started...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You know - a lot you have said about me.
    <br>You prayed to bind me, you prayed to loose me.
    <br>There was a time you gave me four years - and it was almost thirty years ago.
    <br>I refused to disappear.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You keep rebuking me, binding me.
    <br>I'm always busy, "In the name of Jesus. Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>I cannot reply you because I'm busy with "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>When you are busy with "Thank You, Jesus", you will not have time to reply your enemy.
    <br>The word "thanks" means blessing.
    <br>Please, take note of this.
    <br>This is the reason why I don't reply my critics
    <br>because I'm busy meditating, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Right now, begin to cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>Now, you are supposed to be pregnant of this prayer, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You will be pregnant of Jesus and you have so much to give.
    <br>Anytime you talk, fire comes out, power comes out.
    <br>As you are saying it, begin to cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>That is what I'm expecting you to say.
    <br>Cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus, "Thank You, Jesus" in your heart, in your spirit.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Say that before you sleep; the Spirit will take it up.
    <br>When you sleep, you cannot say it again; the Spirit in you will say it.
    <br>The Spirit will take it up and continue that, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>No enemy can come against you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Cover yourself with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>"I cover myself with the Blood of Jesus. Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Only you know what you are thanking Him for; your enemy can never know.
    <br>You know why you are saying, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I cover myself with the Blood of Jesus."
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Whatever spirit that is operating in your life -
    <br>right now, begin to chase them out!
    <br>Operating in your business, career, family - whatever spirit...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Whatever spirit that disturbs you career, that disturbs you...
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever spirit, I mean, familiar spirit.
    <br>When I say "whatever spirit" - you know what it means?
    <br>"Whatever spirit" means familiar spirit.
    <br>Familiar spirits - these are the spirits that cause frustration, tension, pressure.
    <br>I rebuke them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That spirit that causes tension, pressure, frustration, setback, stagnation -
    <br>leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every nightmare...
    <br>Nightmare means what hinders what you deserve.
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Those things that hinder what you deserve -
    <br>you deserve excellence.
    <br>I say you deserve excellence.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Are you not a child of God?
    <br>You deserve excellence.
    <br>Those things that hinder what you deserve are nightmares.
    <br>Every nightmare...
    <br>Look at the instruction we are giving now;
    <br>this instruction, "Thank You, Jesus":
    <br>You cannot be saying "Thank You, Jesus" all the time and still do evil.
    <br>Look at me:
    <br>I'm saying, "Thank You, Jesus" and at the same time moving to dupe people.
    <br>It is not going to work.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" I'm saying in my heart and I'm going to steal - it cannot work.
    <br>That name!
    <br>There is wonderful name
    <br>Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
    <br>Don't forget:
    <br>Joshua said to his people to shout Hallelujah.
    <br>It's an instruction and I am giving you this instruction.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" is an instruction given to you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>He said, "Children of God, shout Hallelujah!"
    <br>And they shouted Hallelujah and the Jericho what?
    <br>So, in the same vein, in the same way, I'm giving you this instruction - don't forget.
    <br>Begin that, "Thank You, Jesus" 24 hours a day and you will know who gave you instruction.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Right now, the instruction given to you is the prayer I have for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>You open your door - "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>When you get used to it and that "Thank You, Jesus" becomes part of you,
    <br>the sky will be your limit.
    <br>At the beginning it will be very difficult because the enemy will want to resist you.
    <br>There will be stiff opposition in your spirit...
    <br>The beginning of everything is always difficult.
    <br>If it is not difficult, it calls for concern.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If it is not difficult at the beginning, it calls for concern".
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[If it is not difficult at the beginning, it calls for concern.]
    <br>At the beginning, it's always difficult - very difficult.
    <br>It shows that it's going to work for you.
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Right now, whatever pain you have in your system -
    <br>command that pain to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command that pain to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It is time - are you ready?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Whatever that is not functioning in your faculties, whatever that is not functioning in your body -
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now open your lips and begin to rebuke whatever that is not functioning.
    <br>Either your blood or your kidneys, your bones that are not functioning.
    <br>Whatever organ that is not functioning, right now command it to begin to function!
    <br>Begin to function!
    <br>Be it your bone - begin to function!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Place your hand wherever the area in your life you have challenges.
    <br>That blood must function!
    <br>That kidney - begin to function!
    <br>That liver - begin to function!
    <br>That bone - begin to function!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>I say begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Continue your "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Start this now; this is the time to start it.
    <br>Where you received that instruction is the place to start it.
    <br>Once you start it here, it becomes part of you.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Remember your country in prayer.
    <br>Whatever you have as a contact point - bring it out.
    <br>Ask God to protect your country.
    <br>Cover your country with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, begin to cover your country with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>Ask God to redeem your leader.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Right now, bring your case before God - your righteous journey as you are leaving here.
    <br>You want to remain a channel of God.
    <br>Where there is hatred, you want to remain as a channel of love,
    <br>a channel of forgiveness,
    <br>a channel of pardon where there is injury.
    <br>Ask God to make you His channel - a channel of shining light, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>A channel of justice where there is injustice.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Father, here are Your children - uphold them Lord, strengthen them,
    <br>give them their desire, guide them, Lord!
    <br>Your justice and Your righteousness shall be with them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let it be with them, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Hallelujah!
