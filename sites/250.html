  <p>    
    <br>We shall talk about faith today.
    <br>What is faith?
    <br>Faith is the evidence of things hoped for.
    <br>One thing is clear about faith:
    <br>Faith is in the present tense.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Faith is in the present tense.
    <br>And what are the promises?
    <br>It receives now.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>It acts now.
    <br>It believes now.
    <br>Now, now, now.
    <br>Our God is God of now.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: My God is God of now.
    <br>He is now.
    <br>He blesses now.
    <br>He saves now.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Faith is the unshakable confidence in the reality of the unseen world.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Faith is the unshakable confidence in the reality of the unseen world.
    <br>Three: The certainty of God's yet unfulfilled promises.
    <br>It is a firm expectation of what God promised us in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Now we have said so much about the definition.
    <br>Let us take it now one by one and explain it.
    <br>When we say faith with what we have heard now,
    <br>what is unseen is therefore the basis of faith.
    <br>What is unseen is therefore the basis of faith.
    <br>Let's now talk of what are those things unseen and those things seen.
    <br>I will take it from the world you are in now.
    <br>This world was not built out of what is seen but out of what is unseen.
    <br>If God had relied on what is seen, He would have nothing to build on.
    <br>What we read in Genesis, the world was formless, void.
    <br>What God relied on was faith in Himself, which was unseen.
    <br>It was that faith that found expression in the spoken word
    <br>which He used in creating the world.
    <br>In other words:
    <br>What is seen came into being from what is unseen.
    <br>What we are looking at - look here.
    <br>Pen or anything else you can talk of.
    <br>What is seen today came into being from what is unseen.
    <br>And what is unseen is faith.
    <br>What is seen today came into being from what is unseen.
    <br>My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes
    <br>Let's rise up.
    <br>My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes
    <br>Touch them.
    <br>My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes -
    <br>they all belong to Jesus!
    <br>Once again.
    <br>My head, my shoulders, my knees, my toes -
    <br>they all belong to Jesus!
    <br>Remember the book of Hebrews.
    <br>Only faith pleases Him.
    <br>When you are talking of God, you are talking of faith.
    <br>It means, they all belong to faith.
    <br>They come by faith.
    <br>An example of what is seen is you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: An example of what is seen is you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>An example of what is seen is you.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>An example of what is seen is you.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>An example of what is seen is you.
    <br>It means, you came into being from what is unseen
    <br>and you return to the unseen world.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Say, I will return to the unseen world.
    <br>You will return one day to the unseen world.
    <br>And the head of the community of the unseen world is Jesus.
    <br>You will return to the unseen community
    <br>Have your seat.
    <br>WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua
    <br>I'm a good example of what is seen - you can see me.
    <br>But when a person passes on, he or she becomes unseen.
    <br>When you say, this person is late, you will not see him or her again.
    <br>Back to where he came from.
    <br>What is unseen is therefore the basis of faith.
    <br>What is seen today came into being from what is unseen.
    <br>What is unseen is therefore the basis of faith.
    <br>I want to clean all of it.
    <br>What is unseen - can you see?
    <br>What is unseen --
    <br>My two legs can be seen.
    <br>My head is unseen.
    <br>Came to seen.
    <br>WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Came to being.
    <br>When we say what is unseen - what is unseen is eternal.
    <br>Eternal life
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>Faith is unseen.
    <br>If you must have faith, you must learn to hear God's Word
    <br>because faith acts on God's Word.
    <br>If you must have faith, you must learn to hear God's Word
    <br>because faith acts on God's Word.
    <br>The opposite of faith is feeling.
    <br>Nearly everyone acts on feeling but they don't know.
    <br>If you say you believe Jesus, you must have confidence in His ability to save, to heal, to deliver.
    <br>You believe in Jesus but you don't have confidence in His ability.
    <br>Even though you have confidence in His ability,
    <br>you have confidence in His ability when the goings are good.
    <br>When the goings are tough - no!
    <br>If I believe in Jesus as my Lord and Saviour,
    <br>I should have confidence in His ability to save, even in the face of trials.
    <br>Even in the face of difficulty, I should have confidence in His ability to protect.
    <br>But opposite is the case today.
    <br>Let's talk about your problem.
    <br>What is your problem?
    <br>You think you are acting faith but acting feeling.
    <br>You don't know the difference between feeling and faith.
    <br>As a Christian, you don't know.
    <br>The consequence, the result, the outcome, the product of faith
    <br>are not only emotional but also affect the realm of the mind.
    <br>The result of faith is not only emotional but also affects the realm of the mind.
    <br>That is, as a man of faith, what is happening around me, does not determine my comfort,
    <br>does not determine my peace.
    <br>When you have the kind of faith I'm talking about,
    <br>you will be fulfilled in Christ.
    <br>And when you are fulfilled in Christ, you lack nothing and you want nothing.
    <br>The Lord is my Sheperd - tell your neighbour -
    <br>I shall not want.
    <br>What is the meaning of that?
    <br>When you say, the Lord is your Sheperd, you shall not want,
    <br>what is the meaning?
    <br>When you are beside the still water -
    <br>this water that does not worry; calm.
    <br>When you move close to the still water, you will be afraid
    <br>because you will not hear the noise; even the fish in the sea will not disturb the sea.
    <br>When you are beside this still water, you will have a situation without panic,
    <br>a situation without fear, a situation without worry, pressure and tension.
    <br>How many of us have this kind of situation?
    <br>Just like what happened at the graveside of Lazarus.
    <br>Ordinarily, the situation did not call for thanksgiving.
    <br>But Jesus went there and saw a body in the tomb and said, "Thank You, Lord!"
    <br>The pharisees said, "Thank You for what?
    <br>We called you to come and raise the body and you say, 'Thank You, Lord'.
    <br>Oh, you mean, thank you for killing him?
    <br>Thank you for the death of our brother?
    <br>You mean, thank you for the body on the ground?
    <br>Thank you - for what?"
    <br>They were expecting Jesus to join them crying.
    <br>The result of faith is not only emotional but also affects the realm of the mind.
    <br>A man of faith may look poor but still happy.
    <br>A man of faith may look so dejected to people; they say, he is lonely.
    <br>But you see him smiling.
    <br>You meet him, "Brother, what is your problem?"
    <br>"No, I don't have a problem; I thank God!"
    <br>That is a man of faith for you.
    <br>We want to talk about this emotion.
    <br>You know when you say 'emotion', we mean feelings.
    <br>Emotion means feelings.
    <br>Sometimes people base their spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.
    <br>They think they are in spirit.
    <br>They say, "Eh, I'm in the spirit!"
    <br>"Oh Lord Jesus, I can feel the spirit of God now!"
    <br>"I can hear! Father, thank You! Thank You for everything!"
    <br>"Ah, I feel the presence of God!"
    <br>Where?
    <br>Because they feel cold air.
    <br>"Hm, thank You, Lord!"
    <br>Some will say, "I want to come to Lagos to see Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>but now I don't have enough money.
    <br>Next week, if I get enough money, God wants me to come to Joshua".
    <br>Before next week, you have enough money. You say, "Yes, God wants me to go".
    <br>How do you know?
    <br>Everything must be examined in the light of God's Word.
    <br>All these are feelings.
    <br>Are what?
    <br>Feelings.
    <br>Whatever sign you receive must be examined in the light of God's Word
    <br>because faith is not a feeling.
    <br>Sometimes people base their spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.
    <br>You say, "God, if you want me to go to church on Sunday, I don't have money.
    <br>I need to pay my tithe.
    <br>If you want me to go to church on next Sunday, please bless me.
    <br>Bless me".
    <br>But from now till Sunday you say, "God, over to you if you want me to go to church".
    <br>But you wake up in the morning and say, "Well, if you want me to go to church;
    <br>if you don't want me to go to church, over to you".
    <br>You should not give God conditions.
    <br>You are created for His own glory.
    <br>Whether good or bad, "Jesus is Lord".
    <br>Sometimes people base their spiritual experiences on feelings and emotions.
    <br>Problems arise when feelings and emotions change.
    <br>They just come.
    <br>"Brother, I have a message for you from the United Kingdom.
    <br>I just received a phone call".
    <br>"Tell me, tell me!"
    <br>I say, "No, I will tell you later".
    <br>Haa!
    <br>Whereas you have somebody at home that is seriously sick.
    <br>"Tell me - what is the message? From who?"
    <br>"Don't worry. I will tell you. Relax."
    <br>"What is the message? Brother, tell me!"
    <br>"No, no. I will tell you."
    <br>He keeps on saying, "Brother, please tell me the message!"
    <br>"No, no. I will tell you."
    <br>Until you go to bed.
    <br>You are about to sleep. You say, "Brother, tell me the message!"
    <br>"No, no. I will tell you at my free time. Don't worry.
    <br>The message is hmmmm."
    <br>"Oh, tell me the message."
    <br>Now you go to bed and start looking, "God, what is this message?"
    <br>"God!"
    <br>You are about to have a nightmare to confirm your message
    <br>because you are worried.
    <br>The realm of the mind is what? - Disturbed.
    <br>The realm of the mind is disturbed.
    <br>This is what I mean by: Problems arise when feelings and emotions change.
    <br>The brother's feelings have what? - Changed.
    <br>Because someone promised to tell you the news from somewhere.
    <br>Your emotions and feelings changed immediately.
    <br>You start thinking about what that message could be.
    <br>Faith is not a feeling.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>But Christians today, they don't know the difference between what? - Faith and feelings.
    <br>You just feel.
    <br>"Ah, my ear is noisy. That is the spirit of God.
    <br>Anytime I have that sign, something good is coming."
    <br>When you are moving around, your eye just starts blinking.
    <br>"Ey, I feel the presence of God."
    <br>Some will see when my stomach is making noise.
    <br>If you have not eaten, the stomach will be disturbing you.
    <br>Let me tell you about faith and feeling.
    <br>For faith to be consistent, it must be based on something with more stability than your feeling.
    <br>When you are controlled by feelings, you can never be consistent in your words.
    <br>You say, "T.B. Joshua is a man of God".
    <br>Another minute another person will come and say, "That man is not a man of God".
    <br>"Yes, he is not a man of God."
    <br>"He is a man of God." - "Yes, he is a man of God."
    <br>"This is red." - "Yes, this is red."
    <br>"You know it is not red, it is yellow." - Yes, it is yellow."
    <br>One can never be consistent in his doings.
    <br>You keep saying "A" today; another minute - "No".
    <br>Because you are like a paper in the face of storm.
    <br>Look at this. Can you see?
    <br>Do you see?
    <br>This is the kind of life one will continue to live.
    <br>When things are good, you say, "Jesus is Lord".
    <br>When things are tough, you say, "Jesus be cursed".
    <br>These are the people that are controlled by feelings and emotions.
    <br>For faith to be consistent, it must be based on something with more stability than your feeling.
    <br>What is the stability?
    <br>That is, feelings lack the quality of being stable.
    <br>Let's give a good example - a footballer.
    <br>What I believe in is training.
    <br>I need training.
    <br>I want to play tomorrow.
    <br>They say, "Brother, after your training you need to pray!"
    <br>"Pray? I need to work. please. My work is God."
    <br>We will get to the field.
    <br>Number 7.
    <br>WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua
    <br>What happened?
    <br>You are not saved because you feel you are saved.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You are not saved because you feel you are saved.
    <br>You are saved because you put your faith on God's Word and acted on it.
    <br>That is feeling.
    <br>After training you have to rely on God.
    <br>Even while training, you say, "In the name of Jesus".
    <br>Continue to meditate the name Jesus.
    <br>"By Your power I am doing this."
    <br>"I am weak. Manifest Your strength in my weakness, Lord Jesus."
    <br>"For when I'm weak, I am strong."
    <br>You are not saved because you feel you are saved.
    <br>You are saved because you put your faith on God's Word and act on it.
    <br>When you say, "Hey, I have practised", "Hey, I am very intelligent",
    <br>"I am a student, I read my books very well",
    <br>"I'm going to make it".
    <br>Read and pray because man has the ability to work
    <br>but the Holy Spirit works as He wills.
    <br>Man has the power to work.
    <br>The Holy Spirit works as He wills.
    <br>It means that He can use any medium.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>It means that He can use any medium to express Himself.
    <br>'As He wills' means He can use any medium to express Himself.
    <br>It could be medium of stone.
    <br>He can use a stone to do His work.
    <br>He can use the medium of attire, hem of garment.
    <br>Remember the woman with the issue of blood touched the garment.
    <br>He can decide to use the medium of sound or voice of servant.
    <br>Remember what happened at the Pentecost.
    <br>It was the sound, and the Holy Spirit came upon them
    <br>and they began to speak in tongues.
    <br>Remember what happened in Acts 3.
    <br>Peter and John said to the crippled man, "Silver or gold we have not".
    <br>That is voice to express Himself.
    <br>Look at what happened in Acts 16 about Paul and Silas.
    <br>It was just sound.
    <br>They started praising God and the miracle happened.
    <br>They never said, "In the name of Jesus, I rebuke!"
    <br>No! While they were chained - hands and legs --
    <br>I know, if you were in their position, you would say,
    <br>"Look, Jesus, if you don't loose me, I won't serve You again!
    <br>Loose me now because I'm innocent".
    <br>But they never said anything like that.
    <br>While they were chained, they were praising God.
    <br>Praising the Lord always
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart
    <br>Praising the Lord with all my heart always
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>They were saying, "The Lord is good", although they were chained.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Even though I am chained, the Lord is good.
    <br>Whether I'm chained or not, the Lord is good.
    <br>Whether I am free or not, the Lord is good.
    <br>Whether I'm okay or not, the Lord is good all the time.
    <br>Remember what happened to Joshua.
    <br>It was a matter of marching round the city,
    <br>and the limitation was broken.
    <br>Are you talking of David?
    <br>It was a matter of catapult.
    <br>He just picked the stone and put it.
    <br>Now, if we are able to define faith, what is feeling then, which is opposite to that.
    <br>Feelings and emotions are influenced by what we see, what we read and what we hear.
    <br>Remember the book of Psalm 12, which says, "Everyone lies to his neighbour".
    <br>This means, everyone is exposed to things that are not consistent with God's Word.
    <br>Everyone is exposed to things that are not consistent with God's Word.
    <br>What are the things that are not consistent with God's Word?
    <br>You want to see breaking news on the pages of a newspaper before you can read the paper.
    <br>Before you tune in to a station, you want to hear, "Oh, there is calamity somewhere! War!"
    <br>If we allow our feelings to control our faith,
    <br>we can be a Christian, yet controlled by satan's devices.
    <br>If our feelings control our faith, we can be a Christian, yet controlled by satan's devices.
    <br>Not that you will not be a Christian.
    <br>What people say, what you read, what you hear,
    <br>what your circumstances look like - this is what controls you.
    <br>One thing you must know.
    <br>You may feel great today, tired tomorrow, lonely next week.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>God's Word is going to say the same thing yesterday, today and forever
    <br>because He is unchangeable.
    <br>You may feel great today, tired tomorrow, lonely next week.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>God's Word is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Forever O Lord
    <br>Your Word is settled
    <br>In Heaven it is settled
    <br>Forever O Lord
    <br>When you look at the book of Hebrews 13:8,
    <br>"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever".
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This is why you must be forever grateful.
    <br>Help me sing this song:
    <br>I'm forever grateful to You
    <br>I'm forever grateful for the cross
    <br>I'm forever grateful to You
    <br>That You came to seek and save the lost
    <br>I'm forever grateful to You
    <br>I'm forever grateful for the cross
    <br>I'm forever grateful to You
    <br>That You came to seek and save the lost
    <br>Have your seat.
    <br>You must forever be grateful.
    <br>No matter what comes, no matter what happens.
    <br>When the goings are good, Jesus is Lord.
    <br>When the goings are tough, you must forever be grateful.
    <br>I think you have learned so much about feelings.
    <br>Feelings are influenced by what we see, what we read,
    <br>and what people tell us.
    <br>When those things control you as a Christian, you can never be consistent in your doings.
    <br>Your moment will look like cat and rabbit.
    <br>When a cat is chasing a rabbit, the rabbit will go this way.
    <br>When the rabbit sees that the cat is too much, it will go this way.
    <br>This is the way of cat and rat.
    <br>Left - right, left - right.
    <br>WHAT IS FAITH? Teaching With T.B. Joshua
    <br>Ok. Look here.
    <br>Here - faith.
    <br>All what we are saying here is all about within and without.
    <br>Many Christians today can fight but filled within with fear.
    <br>I'm having headache: "Jesus, heal me!"
    <br>When they realise the more they call the name Jesus, the more the headache,
    <br>and the headache is serious - "In Jesus' name" -
    <br>"I need to go and see my doctor
    <br>because I think God wants me to see my doctor!
    <br>That is why the more I call His name, the more the headache!
    <br>He wants me to go and see my doctor!
    <br>If not, He will answer my prayer!"
    <br>You see, many Christians today, when trouble is far, they are good in calling the name Jesus.
    <br>Like you learn that there is a war somewhere - far.
    <br>You read it on the pages of a newspaper; you saw it on a channel.
    <br>There is a war somewhere - far.
    <br>Now, you want to pray to stop the war.
    <br>"Hey, Jesus Christ, that war there should stop there, should just stop!"
    <br>By the time you open your eyes, you find that the war is just at your door.
    <br>The trouble you are trying to stop far away is now very close to your door.
    <br>This time, you will not close your eyes.
    <br>You say, "Ah! What do You want me to do?"
    <br>When faith fills our soul, it fills our soul with a strong desire
    <br>for the things we pray for.
    <br>It fills our soul with a strong desire to pray the more, even in the face of trial,
    <br>to pray the more even in the face of temptation,
    <br>to pray the more even in the face of threats to life.
    <br>Let me take you to the book of Daniel.
    <br>In Daniel 6: 10, "Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published,
    <br>he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem".
    <br>While the decree was published, Daniel still had that boldness to go to the upper room.
    <br>Faith fills our soul with a strong desire.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Faith fills our soul with a strong desire.
    <br>It fills our soul with a strong desire for the things we pray for -
    <br>desire to pray the more even in the face of trouble,
    <br>to pray the more even in the face of threats to life.
    <br>Like I was telling you:
    <br>If faith affects the realm of the mind, this means
    <br>whatever we see should be examined in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Whatever we hear should be examined in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Whatever we read should be examined in the light of God's Word.
    <br>When something happens to you, whether positive or negative,
    <br>as a man of faith, it will be too soon to jubilate or despair
    <br>without finding out what God says about it.
    <br>Because faith is not only emotional but also affects the realm of the mind.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: When something happens to you, whether positive or negative,
    <br>it will be too soon to jubilate, if it is positive;
    <br>it will be too soon to despair, if it is negative,
    <br>without finding out what God says about it.
    <br>If it is positive, it will be too soon to say, "Ahh, this is money!"
    <br>because when joy is not handled carefully,  it will soon turn to sadness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: When joy is not handled carefully,  it will soon turn to sadness.
    <br>When sadness is handled carefully, it will soon turn to joy.
    <br>How you handle your situation matters as a man of faith.
    <br>God sometimes uses foolish things to confound the wise.
    <br>To the wise, poverty is a foolish thing.
    <br>To the wise, sickness is a foolish thing.
    <br>To the wise, barrenness is a foolish thing.
    <br>To the wise, nightmare is a foolish thing.
    <br>To the wise, setback is a foolish thing.
    <br>Remember, it was disappointment that preserved Peter.

    <br>Our God is an awesome God

    <br>Amen!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>If you must have faith, you must learn to hear God's Word.
    <br>It is important for you to not only hear it with your ears, but also with your heart.
    <br>With your what? - Heart.
    <br>To hear God's Word in our heart requires openness and hunger for God's Word.
    <br>When you are hungry for God's Word - it means your life depends on knowing it.
    <br>If your life does not depend on knowing God's Word, you cannot be hungry for it.
    <br>You cannot.
    <br>And your life can only depend on knowing it when you have love for it, time for it.
    <br>When you learn to hear God's Word, you have affection for it.
    <br>Through hearing, belief comes.
    <br>Through believing, trust comes.
    <br>Through trusting, confidence is established.
    <br>Now, in conclusion.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This process is not automatic - the process of hearing and obeying.
    <br>I said, through hearing, belief comes.
    <br>Through believing, trust comes.
    <br>Through trusting, confidence is established.
    <br>This process is not automatic but gradual.
    <br>However, this process is not automatic but gradual.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>I mean, those who refuse to take these tiny steps cannot believe God.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Those who refuse to take these tiny steps cannot believe God.
    <br>Because they cannot understand the basic truth about faith.
    <br>Look at what happened to the boy's father.
    <br>Among the crowd, the boy's father put to shame the faithless generation with his belief and prayer.
    <br>These two things.
    <br>It was not automatic.
    <br>"I believe, help my unbelief!"
    <br>That is not automatic. If it were automatic, "I believe" and you would just receive.
    <br>He said, "I believe". At the same time he withdrew, "Ah, help my unbelief".
    <br>Let's take you there.
    <br>Mark 9:24, "Immediately the boy's father shouted,
    <br>"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"
    <br>Now, there are two statements there.
    <br>With his belief and prayer saying, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"
    <br>He put to shame the faithless generation with his belief.
    <br>Remember, with his belief; that is, traditional belief.
    <br>Because he said, "I believe" and later he said, "Help me overcome my unbelief!".
    <br>It means, that belief he claimed at the beginning was unable to receive from Jesus
    <br>because believing is the condition to receive.
    <br>Now, we say with his belief and prayer.
    <br>This statement is both an expression of his belief in our Lord Jesus Christ and prayer for help.
    <br>It was that faith that found expression in the spoken word.
    <br>Let me take you to Genesis 1:3,
    <br>"God said, 'Let there be light', and there was light".
    <br>Wow.
    <br>That command was an expression of God's faith in Himself.
    <br>Back to Mark 11.
    <br>If I may read verse 23.
    <br>"I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, through yourself into the sea' --"
    <br>Be thou removed!
    <br>It was God's faith in Himself.
    <br>Be thou removed!
    <br>That is God in action.
    <br>When the believer says, "In the name of Jesus, be thou removed!",
    <br>it is an expression of the believer's faith in God.
    <br>Let me take you to the book of Acts 3.
    <br>"Then Peter said, 'Look at us!'"
    <br>That is all!
    <br>That is the part I need.
    <br>"Then Peter said, 'Look at us!'"
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>That is attention!
    <br>I mean, genuine willingness.
    <br>Look at, "Pay attention to God's Word because God is in His Word".
    <br>"Then Peter said, 'Look at us!'"
    <br>It means, "Attention, please!"
    <br>If you must have faith - I'm telling you how to have faith - you must pay attention.
    <br>I mean, genuine willingness.
    <br>Genuine willingness means you must forget yourself.
    <br>How do we forget ourselves?
    <br>We forget ourselves when we leave it for God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Leave it for God!
    <br>We pay attention when we leave it for God.
    <br>Say, leave it for God!
    <br>Leave your trouble for God,
    <br>your worry for God!
    <br>Leave it for God!
    <br>God is aware.
    <br>He is aware of your injustice.
    <br>He will not leave you without justice.
    <br>He is aware of your sickness.
    <br>He will not leave you without healing.
    <br>He is aware of your yoke.
    <br>He will not leave you without freedom.
    <br>He is aware of your failure.
    <br>He will not leave you without success.
    <br>He is aware! Say, He is aware!
    <br>Leave it for God!
    <br>Leave it for God
    <br>Don't worry yourself
    <br>Leave it for God
    <br>Don't cry no more
    <br>Jesus is alive
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>You can face tomorrow
    <br>He understands
    <br>What you are passing through today
    <br>Let God glorify His name
    <br>Don't worry; leave it for God.
    <br>Your failure - leave it for God. Your poverty - leave it for God.
    <br>Your nightmare - leave it for God. Your trouble - leave it for God.
    <br>Your panic - leave it for God.
    <br>Leave it for God!
    <br>This is the only way you can have faith - leave it for God and stay focused!
    <br>You cannot show genuine willingness if you don't leave it for God.
    <br>It is either you are yes or no.
    <br>You cannot be yes and no.
    <br>It is either you are righteous or unrighteous.
    <br>There is no neutral kingdom.
    <br>God is able
    <br>Abundantly able
    <br>To deliver and to save
    <br>God is able
    <br>Abundantly able
    <br>To deliver those who trust in Him
    <br>Underline the word 'trust'.
    <br>If you trust Him, you leave your worry for Him.
    <br>If you trust God, you leave your failure for Him.
    <br>If you trust Him, you leave your panic for Him.
    <br>If you trust Him, you leave your barrenness, your nightmare for Him.
    <br>I have confidence in His ability to heal, to bless, to save.
    <br>If you believe Him, you must have confidence in His ability.
    <br>"Then Peter said, 'Look at us!'"
    <br>You know what Peter was saying?
    <br>He was saying, he should leave his worry for God and look at him.
    <br>To know Jesus is not only to see His works but to learn His way.
    <br>To know Jesus is not only to see His miracles but also to learn His way.
    <br>To know Jesus Christ is not only to see His works but also to learn His way.
    <br>Thank you very much, in Jesus' name!
