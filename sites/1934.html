    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr Waziri Fuwanu from Taraba State.
    <br>This is my lovely wife, Blessing Fuwanu Waziri, also from Taraba State.
    <br>My testimony is an Emmanuel TV testimony.
    <br>As you are seeing here, I am very happy to have this opportunity to testify
    <br>to the glory of the Lord in my life.
    <br>I was addicted to drinking alcohol, especially beer.
    <br>When I say 'addiction', it is not like ordinarily taking one or two bottles.
    <br>I could finish 14 bottles in a day.
    <br>In my car, you would always see a bottle or can of beer.
    <br>For how many years?
    <br>For 17 years, I had been drinking.
    <br>- For 17 good years?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- You have been under the influence of alcohol?
    <br>- Yeah.
    <br>Sir, we want you to tell us:
    <br>How has this spirit of drunkenness affected you?
    <br>Oh my God! It has affected me financially.
    <br>As you are seeing me here, I am an accountant serving with the Taraba State Primary Education Board.
    <br>I didn't know what I was doing with the money; I couldn't keep it in my account.
    <br>My car was my bank; I would always keep my money in my car.
    <br>If I went out and saw any beer parlour, I would park and drink.
    <br>On Sunday, I wouldn't go to church.
    <br>I would park my car at a beer parlour and drink with my friends.
    <br>When I entered the beer parlour, they would all hail me, expecting a free drink.
    <br>I really struggled with this addiction.
    <br>My mum even said she was going to curse me if I didn't stop drinking.
    <br>The more I tried to stop it, the more it persisted.
    <br>Until one fateful day, I was watching Emmanuel TV during a live Sunday service.
    <br>I saw the man of God moving in the midst of the congregation, prophesying to them.
    <br>He met one man and asked if he could speak to him.
    <br>The man said, "Yes".
    <br>He said, "You are drinking beer. If you don't stop drinking, they will poison you."
    <br>I was in my parlour with my wife; I just stood up.
    <br>Something told me, "See, this is your miracle! Go and touch the television."
    <br>Something pushed me; I just walked up and touched the screen of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I said, "I claim this prophecy, in Jesus' name. I will never drink again!"
    <br>I forgot myself completely and for two weeks, I didn't drink!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Yes, He is worthy of our praises.
    <br>After that - what happened?
    <br>As I touched the screen, I just felt a cold sensation in my heart.
    <br>I didn't go out that day at all. In fact, for two weeks I didn't go out to drink.
    <br>One day, I said to my wife, "It's been almost two weeks without drinking."
    <br>My wife said, "God of T.B. Joshua has done it!"
    <br>Let us put our hands together for our Lord, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sir, now that you have been set free, tell us - are you still having that urge?
    <br>Now, I don't like beer.
    <br>Even if you promise me N1,000,000 to enter a beer parlour,
    <br>you can take it away and let me remain in poverty.
    <br>Some people asked how I managed to leave this addiction to drinking beer.
    <br>I told them that the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua had done it.
    <br>I would open my phone and show them the picture of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>They glorified God and said they also planned to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I told them that I didn't even come to The SCOAN but just prayed with Emmanuel TV.
    <br>They were shocked.
    <br>Some of my friends even acquired Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>When I was in this trouble, I would not buy good clothes for myself
    <br>but I would mostly buy drinks for other people.
    <br>I could not buy good clothes; I didn't even take care of my wife.
    <br>If she asked me for N1,000, I would not give her but I could drink from N3,000 to N5,000 outside every day.
    <br>To God be the glory. Let us put our hands together for our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Yes, with Him all things are possible.
    <br>And tell us, sir:
    <br>You say you always were buying drinks for your friends,
    <br>they were always rejoicing when you were in the beer parlour.
    <br>And now, with this drastic change that occurred in your life,
    <br>can you tell us what happened to you?
    <br>It is really a miracle.
    <br>My friends who I was doing this with, I advise them to stop drinking alcohol.
    <br>When I received this miracle, from there I began to know the purpose of life.
    <br>The purpose of life is to glorify God, not to be going out drinking.
    <br>On Sunday, when people are supposed to be in the church,
    <br>you will see some of them in a beer parlour.
    <br>It is very, very bad!
    <br>It affected me spiritually and physically.
    <br>I didn't pray in the night.
    <br>When I got up in the morning, I would see my wife praying but I couldn't join her.
    <br>Somebody that got drunk yesterday would be weak.
    <br>Honestly, sometimes I would be hearing my wife praying for God to arrest and change me.
    <br>I would tell her to stop disturbing my sleep and let me rest.
    <br>But see, the Lord has done it now.
    <br>We are living happily!
    <br>There is no fighting.
    <br>I love her more and more now.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Let's us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Yes. We thank God Almighty for everything.
    <br>Tell us one more thing:
    <br>Please, for how long have you stopped drinking?
    <br>I stopped drinking alcohol on 28th June 2012.
    <br>Up till now, I have not taken it again. I hate it!
    <br>You mean no more urge for drinking?
    <br>- You are perfectly delivered?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Cleaned, in the name of Jesus, by the blood of Jesus.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>One of my friends is a lecturer in a Federal Polytechnic.
    <br>He even invited me for his birthday on the 28th June.
    <br>When I went there, they gave me a bottle of beer but I couldn't drink it;
    <br>I said that it was like poison and started to vomit.
    <br>Since that day up to today, I have not tasted alcohol.
    <br>I hate it.
    <br>Let us clap for Jesus one more time.
    <br>- You mean God Almighty has set you free?
    <br>- Really, really!
    <br>Because Jesus Christ rose from the dead for you to receive a new instruction,
    <br>a new life, a new health, new finances, a new marriage.
    <br>We thank God Almighty that God Almighty has indeed fulfilled your heart's desire, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Now, let us hear from your wife.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Blessing Waziri Fuwanu.
    <br>Here is my lovely husband.
    <br>My husband was addicted to drinking alcohol before we married.
    <br>Even before you got married to your husband, he had been drinking alcohol?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ever since this miracle has come upon your husband,
    <br>tell us how life has been in your matrimonial home.
    <br>Now we are together; before, we were not praying but now,
    <br>we are praying together and going to church together.
    <br>Whatever I request from him, he gives me.
    <br>I thank God!
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Yes. A Christian home does not just happen - it is built on the foundation of Jesus Christ.
    <br>People of God, it is really a miracle.
    <br>If you have run out of rope, grab onto faith.
    <br>The Lord will locate you as He located me, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I want to advise my friends who were in this problem with me - it is dangerous.
    <br>It destroyed my life before; I had a big stomach.
    <br>You would think it was because of money but it was because of beer, not money.
    <br>You can see my stomach is normal, now.
    <br>I am OK now and am feeling good.
    <br>You are perfectly fit, for the glory of God!
    <br>Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God Almighty.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>Emmanuel TV is also a medium; keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>One day, God will visit you.
    <br>Hallelujah! Emmanuel TV is changing lives, changing nations and changing the world.
    <br>Now that you have a new life, this new life gives you a new love.
    <br>Enforce this love into your life and God Almighty will back you up
    <br>by directing your steps, and this blessing shall remain permanent in your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus.
