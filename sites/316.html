    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers,
    <br>it is the for the glory of God.
    <br>An EYE-OPENING Miracle!!!
    <br>Here is Nosa Irabor who has come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>with the problem of eye cancer.
    <br>The cancer has affected his left eye so badly
    <br>to the extent that he can't see well.
    <br>Imagine the pain and discomfort he had to endure because of this problem.
    <br>As Nosa Irabor sits helplessly in the prayer line of The SCOAN...
    <br>Be healed in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The man of God, Prophet TB Joshua, stretches forth his hand and prays over him,
    <br>knowing that God has what He says He has,
    <br>He can do what He says He can do,
    <br>and He will do what He says He will do.
    <br>You are free!
    <br>There is another brother, that the Lord has set free from eye cancer
    <br>and you can see the brother giving thanks.
    <br>Three weeks after receiving prayer from Prophet TB Joshua,
    <br>Nosa Irabor came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to testify that he is completely free.
    <br>Nosa Irabor came to The SCOAN
    <br>for the first time at age 14
    <br>suffering from eye cancer,
    <br>causing his eye to be extremely swollen.
    <br>He couldn't do anything without pain.
    <br>But as you can see,
    <br>the once cancerous eye that had caused so much pain and discomfort to this young boy
    <br>is now a thing of the past.
    <br>Thirteen years after his healing,
    <br>Nosa Irabor came back to The SCOAN
    <br>testifying that he is still completely free.
    <br>Nosa Irabor 13 years later.
    <br>Now a fully grown man,
    <br>Nosa Irabor came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to share his testimony with the people of God.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Nosa Irabor.
    <br>I am from Edo State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>was the problem of eye cancer thirteen years ago.
    <br>Then, I was very small.
    <br>When I had this problem,
    <br>I went to so many places for a solution
    <br>but I found none.
    <br>The doctor said that he is going to operate on my eyes.
    <br>Then as a child, I started crying.
    <br>When I came to this church,
    <br>the man of God prayed for me
    <br>and instantly my eye burst
    <br>and pus started coming out of my eyes.
    <br>He said, "Go. Your healing is permanent".
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Since then I have not had any problems with my eyes.
    <br>I can see clearly with my eye and read with it.
    <br>I came to say, "Thank You, Jesus"
    <br>and to say thank you to the man of God.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
