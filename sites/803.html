  <p>    
    <br>Come here.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Who is she to you?
    <br>That's my ex-wife of 30 years.
    <br>There is a divorce and you are the cause.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You are the cause of divorcing.
    <br>Yes, I am.
    <br>That is why I have to talk to her; she's the issue.
    <br>If she says, "Yes" it's yes;
    <br>if she says "No", it's no.
    <br>You are the cause of all this.
    <br>I am the cause.
    <br>At a time, God was blessing you with money.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So, you messed up the whole thing.
    <br>Yes, I messed up.
    <br>At a time when things were very difficult, she was with you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, things are good, you go out looking for women.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That destroyed your marriage.
    <br>It destroyed me.
    <br>You did not keep your marriage and this is a woman who can take care of you.
    <br>Because you have tasted many women who are zero.
    <br>I wasted 30 years.
    <br>You have not seen anything unless God restores this marriage.
    <br>I can't say this in the presence of my sister - I need to see you.
    <br>This is sickness.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This is sickness.
    <br>It is sickness.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Velma Garland and the man standing next to me is my ex-husband Carl Garland.
    <br>We are from the USA.
    <br>Last Sunday was the first time I attended The SCOAN service.
    <br>The Prophet came over to us and he began to prophesy to me.
    <br>He told my husband that there was trouble.
    <br>He said that there was a divorce.
    <br>He asked where was the letter.
    <br>He was talking about the letter of divorce.
    <br>He looked at my husband and said, "You caused it".
    <br>He said, "When you had nothing, she was with you
    <br>but when God started blessing and the money started coming in,
    <br>you started going out, looking for other women".
    <br>This leads me to my problem.
    <br>I have been married to Carl for 30 years.
    <br>What the man of God said was very very true and accurate.
    <br>Women were calling me and leaving messages on my phone.
    <br>One even had the nerve to tell me that she'd been seeing him for 7 years.
    <br>One left a message and she had some things to say too.
    <br>I asked him about this.
    <br>He promised that he would never do it again but then it happened again.
    <br>I believed him because at that point we'd been together like 25 years.
    <br>We went on but then it happened again.
    <br>Because of his numerous affairs and his dealings with other women,
    <br>he made me sick and this led to our divorce.
    <br>This divorce happened last year.
    <br>In the process of this year I was looking on TV and I came across Youtube and I saw Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was watching the testimonies there, which were very compelling.
    <br>I live in US and this is Africa - I have never been to Africa.
    <br>I said, "If he can help those people..."
    <br>I was watching deliverances and demons manifesting.
    <br>These people were talking about how God had reconciled them after the deliverance.
    <br>I felt like if I could get here that maybe God could do the same thing for me and my marriage.
    <br>When I got here - this was the first time I had ever been here -
    <br>he laid hands on us and especially with my husband, he got delivered.
    <br>It started last Sunday - I started to see a change in him.
    <br>True repentance - I mean true repentance
    <br>Velma Garland & Ex-husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>and humility.
    <br>The arrogance was not there.
    <br>The affection for me came back.
    <br>Velma Garland & Ex-husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>He acts like he cares for me again.
    <br>Yesterday, we went to the prayer mountain.
    <br>At that prayer mountain we began praying.
    <br>I began to speak, as we were praying, in my heavenly voice because he didn't have the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Next thing I know; he started speaking in tongues - he got filled with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>You know; I told you that satan causes people to lose control.
    <br>The man, my brother, was losing control in the past.
    <br>He lost control.
    <br>But now he has come to his senses.
    <br>He realized that what he had been doing in the past was wrong.
    <br>Now you can see.
    <br>This is why you have to cultivate and have a habit of forgiveness.
    <br>Forgive your neighbour.
    <br>What they have done to you is not out of hatred but they lost control.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Forgive your neighbour."
    <br>[Forgive your neighbour.]
    <br>You can see now.
    <br>He lost control.
    <br>Now he has come to his senses and realized...
    <br>Look at the testimony the wife is giving about him.
    <br>She says she was shocked.
    <br>When you were under bondage and you are released, you will see the true colours of yourself.
    <br>This is why the Lord says, "Forgive and forget".
    <br>You have to learn to forgive.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Whatever anyone might have done to you; please forgive and forget.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>After the prayer, after touching him - I know it is not easy when you are not delivered.
    <br>Forgiveness must come through deliverance.
    <br>You cannot just say, "I forgive" - because it is not natural.
    <br>What happened to you is not natural.
    <br>It is spiritual and you must be released.
    <br>When you are released, you will see the need of forgiveness.
    <br>Man of God, here is the divorce letter that you spoke about.
    <br>OK, this is the divorce letter I told you about, "Look, this is divorce. Where is the letter?"
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>I want to know if the decision that I made to divorce him is wrong or right
    <br>and what God has to say about this reconciliation.
    <br>Yes, I'm happy.
    <br>Now, you have realized yourself and he has realized himself.
    <br>He lost control then.
    <br>That is why he committed those shameful acts.
    <br>Now, we have realized ourselves.
    <br>Love is natural.
    <br>It is from the heart.
    <br>When the love comes from the heart no one can stop it.
    <br>Now, the love that comes from the heart is what you have to exercise.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Not because he says sorry, cries or suffers.
    <br>Because of this, because of that  - no.
    <br>The love that comes from the heart - exercise it.
    <br>That is the love that can build a marriage.
    <br>Marriage is not for a while - it is forever.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The reason for which many marriages don't last is that this love is not from the heart.
    <br>If the love is from the heart, no matter what happens, the love from the heart will see you through.
    <br>What happened cannot destroy the marriage, cannot separate the marriage.
    <br>God can.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Because the love from the heart is love from God.
    <br>If God says "Yes", no one can say "No".
    <br>When the love comes from the heart, it does not mean there will be no tribulation.
    <br>There will be tribulation.
    <br>There will be all kinds of crisis.
    <br>I was telling people yesterday that God's plan for our life causes us to face trouble.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God's plan for our life caused us to face trouble".
    <br>Your trouble could be temptation, persecution, sickness, or of any other kind.
    <br>God's plan for our life causes us to face trouble.
    <br>And we are all running for the trouble.
    <br>That trouble is the one that strengthens our life.
    <br>Are you with me there?
    <br>What strengthens our life?
    <br>[Trouble.]
    <br>We run for the very thing that brings strength to our life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "We run from the very thing that strengthens our life".
    <br>We run from the trouble.
    <br>Naturally, no one wants trouble.
    <br>Naturally, when you see a trouble coming, you have to run.
    <br>It is that trouble that strengthens our life; just as fire strengthens gold, trouble strengthens our life.
    <br>Think about what I said; you will agree with me.
    <br>Just as fire strengthens gold.
    <br>You know; fire removes impurities from gold.
    <br>If not fire, you cannot discover pure gold.
    <br>Impurities cover gold.
    <br>But when gold passes through fire, it removes those impurities.
    <br>You will now see a shining gold.
    <br>In the same vein, problems strengthen your life.
    <br>God's plan for our life causes us to face trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God's plan for our life causes us to face problems".
    <br>What is the problem?
    <br>When a problem comes and you overcome it, you are promoted.
    <br>It comes, you are promoted.
    <br>Without problem, you remain on a spot.
    <br>We run from the very thing that brings strength to our life.
    <br>What is the very thing?
    <br>Problem.
    <br>Your problem could be persecution, hatred, sicknes, - just name it.
    <br>Look at homes today: divorce, divorce, divorce...
    <br>What is the cause of divorce?
    <br>Problem.
    <br>When you see a wonderful, successful marriage today...
    <br>When you meet them; in all areas they succeeded: children, home...
    <br>They are at their senior age.
    <br>When you meet them and ask them to counsel you, you ask them how they did manage
    <br>to keep the marriage from the beginning and you refused to divorce and you are at your senior age.
    <br>They will tell you that they have seen a lot in their lives.
    <br>A friend wanted to separate the marriage, an enemy came to separate the marriage,
    <br>satan came to separate the marriage, a lot of lies, a lot of stories.
    <br>Temptation came - we refused to separate.
    <br>Today, this is a wonderful marriage.
    <br>We run from the very thing that brings strength to our life.
    <br>We run from problem.
    <br>When a problem comes, we try to avoid it.
    <br>Whatever you can do, you want to do it.
    <br>When a trouble comes in the marriage - "your wife is this" - you, instead of sitting down,
    <br>knowing that trouble cannot separate a marriage from God,
    <br>"No, no, why should you behave like that?"
    <br>You are no longer interested in the marriage; you go to another one.
    <br>The same applies to work.
    <br>You have attempted a lot of businesses and jobs.
    <br>You were once an architect, contractor...
    <br>There is nothing you have not done.
    <br>If they look in your pocket, they will see different business cards.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Once you attempt the business and you run into loss, that is the end of that business.
    <br>You are looking for another business.
    <br>You don't want to hear about any loss.
    <br>And that loss strengthens our life to succeed.
    <br>Successful businessmen today, chairmen of many companies; when you meet them,
    <br>they will tell you about a lot of loss they have gone through.
    <br>A lot of "prison", damage, they run into debts, but they stood by.
    <br>You move from one business to another.
    <br>You don't want to hear anything about loss.
    <br>You don't want to hear about shortage.
    <br>You don't want to hear this.
    <br>When you hear about shortage, you run, you abandon the business, you run to another.
    <br>"Look, my brother is into clearing and forwarding, he made it" - you run to that.
    <br>You abandon the other one.
    <br>This is why our life is like this.
    <br>There is no business you do where you would not face trouble.
    <br>You keep running from trouble.
    <br>Look, you need to go to Heaven, if you say that you don't want to see trouble.
    <br>I have answered your question now.
    <br>Yes, you have.
    <br>If you are looking for a smooth marriage, you need to go to Heaven.
    <br>Velma Garland & Ex-husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>This is one of the things that strengthens marriage.
    <br>Dispute.
    <br>Trouble.
    <br>One of the things that strengthens the marriage.
    <br>When you get to the US, meet successful aged marriage couples.
    <br>Meet them, let them counsel you.
    <br>They will tell you what they have gone through in life to maintain their marriage.
    <br>So you may say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>This is God's marriage.
    <br>Let me hear from our brother.
    <br>My name is Carl Garland.
    <br>I am from the USA.
    <br>I just want to say that last Sunday we were sitting over there and the man of God came and touched me.
    <br>He prophesied to me that he knew that there was a divorce.
    <br>He said that I had a lot of money and I was messing with a lot of women.
    <br>He said he saw a disease.
    <br>Look, we are not even expecting you to talk.
    <br>This is our mum here.
    <br>Once we hear from our mum, we are OK.
    <br>Can you just give a hug to my mum and say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Give her a hug.
    <br>Velma Garland & Ex-husband
    <br>Reconciled Through Prophecy
    <br>Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me...
    <br>I love you.
    <br>I want to tell...
    <br>Look, my brother.
    <br>I want to tell you that this woman is your mum.
    <br>Try to be a father.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>She has gone through a lot of pain but because of Jesus, she put everything behind.
    <br>Velma Garland & Ex-husband
    <br>Reconciled Through Prophecy
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Man of God, I want to thank you for reconciling me with my wife.
    <br>I also want to say that I love you and I am very sorry.
    <br>And I want to say to you - listen to me:
    <br>that the marriage has been settled does not mean that the crisis has stopped.
    <br>There will be trouble and trouble and trouble...
    <br>The more the trouble, the more your strength.
    <br>Strength comes to marriage through what?
    <br>[Trouble.]
    <br>Through trouble.
    <br>No temptation can separate this marriage.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Velma Garland & Ex-husband
    <br>Reconciled Through Prophecy
    <br>Instead, the temptation will strengthen it.
    <br>As disagreement comes, strength comes.
    <br>Disagreement - agreement.
    <br>That is just life.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I want to meet you for counseling.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Give me your hand
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brother, come.
    <br>What would you do with those troubles coming to you?
    <br>I would not allow it to make me lose control.
    <br>Yes, you would not allow trouble to overwhelm you.
    <br>Because when it overwhelms you, you lose control.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When something overwhelms you, like wine - when you are taking alcohol,
    <br>your eyes begin to shine.
    <br>I know, when you sit sober with people taking alcohol,- they will talk well after the first cup.
    <br>But the second cup - you see their eyes becoming bright.
    <br>You ask them, "Are you all right?"
    <br>When trouble overwhelms you, it takes control.
    <br>If you don't allow it to overwhelm you...
    <br>How can the trouble overwhelm us?
    <br>When we begin to look at the trouble, giving respect to the trouble as it is a way of life.
    <br>When it comes, the end has not come.
    <br>You look at this trouble.
    <br>Remember, when you were in your mother's womb, when you were an embryo;
    <br>if trouble could not destroy you then, is it now that trouble would destroy you?
