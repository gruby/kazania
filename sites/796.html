  <p>    
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>Holy Spirit, we thank You. Give thanks to God.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>I want us to lift up our voice and pray this
    <br>coming Thursday.
    <br>Whatever that will happen that will cause
    <br>a conflict between the superpower nations.
    <br>Because I see a situation where one will tempt the other and that will provoke the whole thing.
    <br>This coming Thursday.
    <br>Please, raise up your voice and begin to pray.
    <br>Pray that God should hold their temper, no matter the temptation from the other side,
    <br>to another country.
    <br>The other country they tempted should hold its temper and should not be provoked to retaliate.
    <br>Then, if they retaliate - well, me and you
    <br>- our fate is hung.
    <br>Raise up your hand.
    <br>This coming Thursday, Friday - pray that whatever that will happen that will cause any nation,
    <br>one of the super nations to be provoked, to retaliate, the Lord should hold their temper.
    <br>No matter what happens, hold your temper.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Father, You are the Lord that created all things.
    <br>You can loose, You can bind.
    <br>Whatever that will happen this coming Thursday and Friday,
    <br>that will cause other nations to be tempted to lose their temper -
    <br>if one is tempted, it's attack
    <br>and the other may lose their temper; that
    <br>is it.
    <br>Father, hold their temper.
    <br>Let them be calm; we ask for calmness.
    <br>We ask for calmness, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>This is what I saw in 2015 and 2016.
    <br>I said, "The fight in Syria will provoke other
    <br>fights".
    <br>They are playing it now and I said, "The Lord should save us".
    <br>I was crying.
    <br>This coming Thursday and Friday are key days.
    <br>Please, fast from morning until 12 midday.
    <br>I know all the nations and people that watch Emmanuel TV,
    <br>when it happens, they will say, "Ah, this
    <br>man said we should hold our temper".
    <br>For the sake of peace, for the sake of harmony in the world.
    <br>What is on the ground now is a devil's workshop.
    <br>The foundation for a devil's workshop is on the ground.
    <br>We are talking of economic meltdown but another one entirely.
    <br>With what is happening now, we cannot talk of economic meltdown.
    <br>Whatever you see, you should heed it and talk about your safety.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>We continue to pray, since God has shown us.
    <br>We will see; God will intervene.
