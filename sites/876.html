    <br>Viewers all over the world, listen.
    <br>Tell your heart, this is instruction from above.
    <br>My heart, this is instruction from above.
    <br>Right now, I press in to touch You - Jesus, deliver me!
    <br>I press in to touch You, Jesus!
    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B Joshua -
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Sickness is a darkness the light of God dispels.
    <br>I command light wherever sickness is located.
    <br>Light in your kidneys!
    <br>Light in your liver!
    <br>Light in your bones!
    <br>Light in your blood!
    <br>Light in your fluids!
    <br>Light!
    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B Joshua -
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Wherever there is light, darkness dispels.
    <br>I command you to disappear!
    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B Joshua -
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Vanish in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Vanish in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B Joshua -
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>There shall be no trace, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Cure!
    <br>Cure, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I love you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I can see you being delivered!
    <br>Right now, begin to confess your deliverance and act it.
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>Being delivered is being given dominion over satan,
    <br>dominion over evil, dominion over devil.
    <br>Confess and give thanks to God.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>To the standard of Jesus, what is not done well is not done at all.
    <br>There shall be no trace.
    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B Joshua -
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>When Jesus cures, He cures perpetually!
    <br>Viewers, I know your state and I know what you are going through.
    <br>Those of us that are on the sickbed, I know what you are going through.
    <br>I know what is happening around you.
    <br>Begin to confess your healing right now.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, confess your healing.
    <br>Whatever result and whatever is coming as a report concerning your health,
    <br>Jesus is final.
    <br>Begin to confess your healing; confess it and receive it.
    <br>Confess healing and receive healing.
    <br>Confess freedom and receive freedom.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You have declared that this is your time; this is your moment to be healed and so shall it be!
    <br>Begin to confess your freedom and receive your freedom.
    <br>Freedom in your bones, blood, kidneys, liver!
    <br>Freedom!
    <br>Somebody believes he is healed and I can hear his voice!
    <br>That is the voice of joy! That is the voice of testimony!
    <br>I rejoice with you.
    <br>I would not mind to make a crazy noise!
    <br>Hallelujah!
