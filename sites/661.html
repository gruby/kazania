    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>On Sunday 31st January, 2016, during a Sunday Live Service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message regarding Saudi Arabia.
    <br>These were his words...
    <br>Saudi as a country - they should pray against attack.
    <br>That is, Saudi Arabia.
    <br>We continue to pray for the whole world but I am seeing something happen there.
    <br>Also, these are the issues I am seeing happen.
    <br>When and where, I've not gone into that but they have to pray.
    <br>So, this is just my message.
    <br>Pray for the nation any time you pray.
    <br>Saudi Arabia - I cannot locate the place but I am seeing an attack.
    <br>They should pray - how to unravel the attack.
    <br>They should watch out.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
