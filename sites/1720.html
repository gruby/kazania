    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel".
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>People of God, once again, you are all welcome in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>I have a very quick story I want to share with you, that will usher us into today's message.
    <br>Last year I was among those that travelled to Israel
    <br>for the wonderful Nazareth meeting with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Who watched the meeting in Nazareth?
    <br>Raise up your hand.
    <br>It was a wonderful, miraculous, incredible event.
    <br>When I went to Israel, shortly after I arrived, I met an elderly gentleman from Israel.
    <br>The moment he saw me, he rushed towards me, greeted me and said,
    <br>"Brother Chris, welcome to Israel!"
    <br>I was surprised how warm his greeting was.
    <br>And he now said this, "Do you know that I am your friend on Facebook?"
    <br>I said, "I'm very sorry, sir, but I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on any social media."
    <br>The man looked at me and said, "No. I spoke to you two days ago".
    <br>I had to try to convince the man, "Sir, look, I assure you - it was not me.
    <br>It was a fake person, someone fraudulent - I'm not the one."
    <br>He was insisting, "But you were the one that told me T.B. Joshua was coming to Israel".
    <br>This was a very bizarre conversation
    <br>because I had to start convincing this man that I am the real Chris and this person was a fake Chris.
    <br>Very confusing.
    <br>And the strange thing was - as I tried to convince him, he seemed to be more convinced
    <br>about the fake Chris on Facebook than the real Chris that was talking to him.
    <br>Why am I sharing this story?
    <br>Because this story is sadly a picture of what is happening in our generation today.
    <br>We live in a fake generation where it is very difficult to be real.
    <br>I mean, it is so difficult to live for God.
    <br>That's what the Bible says in Matthew 22:14:
    <br>"... many are called, but few are chosen."
    <br>In this generation that we are in today, don't just quickly arrive at a conclusion
    <br>without examining what you hear in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Those days of just taking what you hear, what you see and what you read at face value,
    <br>those days are gone.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Those days are gone".
    <br>Tell your other neighbour, "Those days are gone".
    <br>Let me try and explain what I mean, give some practical examples.
    <br>"Uh! Look at that beautiful lady. I love her."
    <br>People of God, those days are gone.
    <br>In this generation you have to look deeper; you have to go beyond the make-up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why?
    <br>Is she beautiful on the surface or beautiful in the heart?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Those days are gone".
    <br>Those days are gone.
    <br>"Come and look at this breaking news online. Quickly share it on your WhatsApp group - wow!"
    <br>Be careful!
    <br>In today's generation don't just quickly take what you read without confirmation,
    <br>because fake news is everywhere.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Those days are gone".
    <br>Those days are gone.
    <br>Or you receive a phone call,
    <br>"Look, I promise you; I'm ready to help you, ready to do it. Just give me one week, I'll settle everything."
    <br>Brothers and sisters, don't be too quick to jubilate.
    <br>The days of taking people at their word and holding onto their promises are gone.
    <br>Love everyone; trust only God.
    <br>"Uh, I'm thirsty. This is bottled water - it looks pure, clean."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Watch out!
    <br>The days of just accepting something as pure because it looks pure are gone.
    <br>In this generation you need to go deeper to confirm, "Is it really pure?"
    <br>lest you take something that is contaminated.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Those days are gone".
    <br>OK, another good example:
    <br>You tuned on your television and you see a pastor preaching a message.
    <br>You see the charisma of the pastor, who is saying,
    <br>"And the Bible says in Psalm 23:4 that even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
    <br>I will fear no evil!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The days of merely listening to a pastor, a prophet, a priest, a bishop, an apostle -
    <br>those days are gone.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The message may be true on the surface but you still need to confirm the messenger
    <br>because anyone can say, "Jesus is Lord!"
    <br>You need to confirm who the person is that is talking to you.
    <br>In the same vein, the days are gone when you can allow anyone to pray for you,
    <br>to lay their hands on you.
    <br>Those days are gone!
    <br>I am not excluding myself.
    <br>As you are listening to my message today, please go and confirm it in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Don't just take what I say.
    <br>Those days are gone.
    <br>What about politicians?
    <br>"No go area!"
    <br>Put on your television - you hear political rally,
    <br>someone campaigning for president, governor, mayor, this, that.
    <br>They say, "I will defeat terror within five months.
    <br>I will provide jobs for all the unemployed youth within six months.
    <br>I will put food on everyone's table and money in everyone's pocket if you vote for me now!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People of God, be wise.
    <br>The days of listening to a political campaign and immediately accepting what they say are gone.
    <br>You need to examine what you hear in the light of God's Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You see someone crying today...
    <br>Look, I'm not saying you should not comfort them - go and comfort them, but be careful of their tears.
    <br>Some tears fall from the eyes but not from the heart.
    <br>You know, I met a lady in the church several years ago.
    <br>After the service she approached me.
    <br>She introduced herself.
    <br>I asked, "What do you do for a living?"
    <br>She said, and I quote this exactly,
    <br>"I am a professional mourner".
    <br>I said, "Can you explain what you mean by that?"
    <br>She said, "Yes, very simple.
    <br>They hire me to go to funerals to cry for those who have died."
    <br>- "Are you serious about this?"
    <br>- "Yes. It's a very lucrative business."
    <br>"Even if someone who died was very wicked, by the time we go there and cry
    <br>they will think he was a heavenly person."
    <br>And you know how many of us have gone to funerals,
    <br>and we have seen people crying and we have joined them to cry,
    <br>not knowing that the tears were paid for by our own contributions.
    <br>That's why I said we are living in a fake generation where it is very difficult to be real.
    <br>That is why you have to examine everything in the light of God's Word.
    <br>What do I mean by examine?
    <br>Examination means don't just take things at face value.
    <br>Don't just accept things at face value.
    <br>Brothers and sisters, I would like you to reflect on your life.
    <br>Viewers around the world, reflect on your own life.
    <br>Many of the situations we find ourselves in today are as a result of not examining our deeds,
    <br>our relationships with people, our encounters with people,
    <br>the promises people made to us, the phone calls we exchanged with people,
    <br>the emails we exchanged with people.
    <br>Not examining them in the light of God's Word has put many of us in the situation we are in today.
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and say, "Neighbour,
    <br>appearance can be deceptive."
    <br>This is why the Bible says in Matthew 26:41, "Watch and pray".
    <br>Watch and pray because of the generation we are living in today.
    <br>Just go to a market, take any popular market in your state, area, country, residency,
    <br>go to that market to find a genuine product - it is difficult, but fake is everywhere.
    <br>To get something genuine, to get something authentic,
    <br>you have to go deeper because we are living in a fake generation.
    <br>This is why the Scripture tells us in John 8:32, "Find out the truth and the truth will set you free."
    <br>And this brings us to the title of today's message:
    <br>FINDING TRUTH IN A FAKE GENERATION
    <br>Turn with me to the Book of Acts 19, which will be our proof text for today's message.
    <br>Acts 19 - I'm going to read from verses 13 to 16.
    <br>This is the case of the seven sons of Sceva - I'm sure you know about it.
    <br>Verse 13 reads thus:
    <br>"Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits
    <br>tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed.
    <br>They would say, 'In the name of the Jesus who Paul preaches, I command you to come out.'
    <br>Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this."
    <br>Now, take note of verse 15.
    <br>"One day..."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "One day".
    <br>"One day the evil spirit answered them,
    <br>'Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but who are you?'
    <br>Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all.
    <br>He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding."
    <br>I want you to focus on those words in verse 15.
    <br>The subject we are looking at here is those two words: one day.
    <br>Don't forget that the seven sons of Sceva were fake.
    <br>They were unauthorised to do the job they were doing
    <br>and one day they faced a question they could not answer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People of God,
    <br>you can be rich and famous and yet be fake.
    <br>One day...
    <br>You can be popular, influential and yet be fake.
    <br>One day...
    <br>You can even claim to have reached the peak, the pinnacle of your career and yet be fake.
    <br>One day...
    <br>One day you will be asked the question: What are you doing? Where did this come from?
    <br>In other words, one day you will face a test of legitimacy.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>This means a season is coming where you will not be able to go further
    <br>because the only One who can take us to the end is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Nothing can take us to the end without Jesus
    <br>because He is the beginning and the end.
    <br>I hope you understand what I'm saying, people of God.
    <br>I hope you are with me.
    <br>You have a race - there is a race.
    <br>Let's say I'm going to run from here to the pulpit.
    <br>If I'm going to start this race...
    <br>The beginning of the race does not determine the winner.
    <br>OK, let's go half-way.
    <br>The midway point of the race does not determine the winner!
    <br>What determines the winner?
    <br>The end.
    <br>Only Jesus can take you to the end because He is the beginning and the end.
    <br>The beginning, the start, the midpoint are off-record;
    <br>the end will set the record straight.
    <br>Are you a graduate and you know how you got there?
    <br>You are using someone else's certificate, or you cheated in your exams.
    <br>One day...
    <br>Have you travelled abroad to another country using a fake visa,
    <br>using someone else's name or passport?
    <br>Look, you may get there, you may seem to be enjoying yourself.
    <br>One day...
    <br>Is your income coming from the proceeds of corruption, misappropriation of public funds?
    <br>Is it coming from stealing or fraud or deception?
    <br>Look, you may seem to be enjoying yourself today...
    <br>One day...
    <br>Everyone will face that question one day: What are you doing?
    <br>Where did this come from?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want you to ask yourself this question: Are you real, are you true
    <br>or are you simply imitating or copying someone else?
    <br>Because people of God,
    <br>anything that is real, anything that is true will stand the test of time.
    <br>It's a common principle:
    <br>Real products last; fake products fade.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>real products last; fake products fade."
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you real?"
    <br>An original document lasts; a photocopy fades.
    <br>What are you doing today that is not real and yet seems to prosper?
    <br>One day it will leave you at the time you need it most.
    <br>This is why Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "To become God's person, you must follow His process."
    <br>The problem is that our generation today is too impatient to go through the process,
    <br>which is why we seem to prefer fake over real.
    <br>Look, I can give you examples of this - they abound in our society.
    <br>Just look at marriages.
    <br>If you are married here today, just raise up your hand.
    <br>Thank you; I know there are more married couples than that.
    <br>Please, don't be offended by what I'm going to say
    <br>but I'm going to speak a reality.
    <br>Marriages today, if they are marriages, if there is marriage,
    <br>many of them nowadays are fake.
    <br>The reason of many marriages today is outward things: money, appearance, fame.
    <br>In marriage of today's generation, it is a matter of body agreement, not heart agreement.
    <br>So, if something happens that tampers with those reasons,
    <br>something happens to the appearance, money, fame -
    <br>the marriage has nothing to rest on and collapses.
    <br>Or you marry because of urge...
    <br>Let me tell you brothers and sisters, getting married cannot stop that urge.
    <br>You marry because of depression.
    <br>Getting married cannot solve the problem of depression.
    <br>You marry because of age.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It's not the right person that brings the right time; it's the right time that brings the right person.
    <br>What of our political life today?
    <br>Democracy was created to be a government by the people, for the people and of the people
    <br>but today that no longer seems to be the case.
    <br>Why is it today that our voices no longer seem to be heard,
    <br>the opinions of people don't seem to matter anymore?
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because for many, the process of their ascendancy to power was tainted.
    <br>Well, I have a very simple, clear message.
    <br>If you are a businessman here or a politician
    <br>and you have built your career upon a stolen mandate,
    <br>my brother, my sister, one day a test of legitimacy is coming your way.
    <br>Whether you like it or not.
    <br>I'm still giving some practical examples here.
    <br>Even in our places of worship, unfortunately, fake has infiltrated.
    <br>To show that fake is an epidemic in our society today - just consider this example:
    <br>There are many political parties whose members belong to different faiths
    <br>and different denominations, different churches,
    <br>and they come together because of politics -
    <br>they eat together, drink together, wine and dine together, work together,
    <br>they share positions among themselves.
    <br>Then, on Sundays, or the respective days of worship -
    <br>they go to their places of worship and now begin to condemn
    <br>criticise and discriminate against each other.
    <br>Is this not hypocrisy?
    <br>OK, let's come to you that are here.
    <br>Church, are you with me?
    <br>Those of you that are here today, I want you to reflect on this:
    <br>We are a large audience, a large congregation here today.
    <br>Many of us that are sitting here today in this wonderful sanctuary;
    <br>the place where you are working,
    <br>the place where you are sustaining your livelihood,
    <br>where you are getting your salary -
    <br>the owner of that place does not share the same faith as you.
    <br>The owner of that place does not attend the same church as you.
    <br>Am I right?
    <br>The same money that you have in your pocket right now,  when it is time for offering and thanksgiving,
    <br>you are going to drop is the money that came from the source of someone
    <br>who doesn't share the same faith or denomination as you.
    <br>Why would you now come to church and begin to speak against them?
    <br>Why would you come to church and begin to say, "Don't go here! Don't go there!",
    <br>whereas the money you are dropping in that same place of worship
    <br>came from the people that you were condemning?
    <br>OK, let me give you another example.
    <br>When you are sick and you go to a medical doctor -
    <br>do you ask the faith or religious background of the doctor before they treat you?
    <br>As long as they are specialised in your area, they will treat you.
    <br>OK, just imagine something happens; you have fallen into a coma and you are lifeless -
    <br>in that situation, do you have the ability to determine who will treat you?
    <br>Are you saying that you have resurrected from the coma and you come back to life,
    <br>and you see that the person that treated you is not part of your faith;
    <br>you will say, "Doctor, please send me back to the coma"?
    <br>You will not.
    <br>Many of us flew on a plane to be here today.
    <br>When you boarded your plane, did you ask the flight attendant,
    <br>"Sorry, flight attendant, what is the faith of the pilot that is flying me?"?
    <br>And your life is in their hands for the duration of that flight,
    <br>and you don't know their religious background or their denomination.
    <br>You are very hungry, you have not eaten for a long time and you sit down in a beautiful restaurant;
    <br>they provide the most exquisite and beautiful food,
    <br>and you begin to look at it, you are about to eat this food,
    <br>have you ever called the chef and said, "Chef, are you a Christian or a Muslim, before I eat this food?
    <br>I want to know which church you attend before I eat this food."
    <br>Have you ever done that?
    <br>Why would anyone now go to a place of worship and turn salvation into condemnation?
    <br>This is hypocrisy.
    <br>And leading a fake life gives birth to hypocrisy.
    <br>Let me rush in another quick story, as I round up this message today.
    <br>Two years ago, a man came to this church, a pastor from a prominent ministry in Nigeria;
    <br>I will not mention the name.
    <br>The man gave a very powerful testimony of how Jesus Christ healed him from an incurable disease,
    <br>after praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>He was open that he was a pastor from another church but he felt the need to give glory to God.
    <br>After giving that testimony, several months later, the same gentleman returned to the church
    <br>and came to meet the testimony department and said this:
    <br>"I was called to my headquarters and they asked me,
    <br>'Did you go and share a testimony at T.B. Joshua's church?'.
    <br>I didn't lie to them, I said yes.
    <br>At that moment they fired me as a pastor."
    <br>The reason I'm bringing up this point;
    <br>I want you to hear what this pastor responded to them,
    <br>because he told us his response.
    <br>The pastor looked at his seniors and supervisors who had just fired him
    <br>for giving glory to Jesus, for rescuing him from a life threatening situation
    <br>and the pastor told them this,
    <br>"My senior pastors, do you know that many members of our church
    <br>have gone to the Synagogue to receive healing?"
    <br>This is the pastor talking.
    <br>"Do you know that many members of this church have gone to The SCOAN
    <br>and received prayer for breakthrough and today their business is blessed?
    <br>Why don't you sack the offerings they are giving?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He didn't stop there, he now said,
    <br>"Go and look at the car park of this church here.
    <br>You will see anointing sticker everywhere.
    <br>Go and check the pockets of many members sitting down in your church;
    <br>you will find morning water there."
    <br>He now said to conclude,
    <br>"One of the high ranking official senior pastors in this church,
    <br>who was the one that instructed members several years ago
    <br>that you must never watch Emmanuel TV."
    <br>He said that several weeks ago he was invited to this man's house before this issue blew up
    <br>and as he approached the house, through the window -
    <br>do you know what he saw on the screen of the television?
    <br>Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The pastor did not know that his friend was close.
    <br>The moment he knocked the door, he changed the channel.
    <br>So many of us have asked the question of Prophet T.B. Joshua:
    <br>Why don't you respond?
    <br>Why don't you react when there is hatred and persecution
    <br>and false accusation and lies levelled against you?
    <br>But I think his response is clearly understood in today's message.
    <br>Time will tell.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Real lasts; fake fades.
    <br>I will not say more than that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>People of God, as I draw this message to a conclusion...
    <br>The only way to be real, to find truth in a fake generation is to depend on God alone.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is no other way; there is no other route.
    <br>Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>To depend on God alone, to love God above all,
    <br>to let the Word of God become the database for your personal opinion - that is the way.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You cannot fight truth and win.
    <br>You can fight fake and defeat fake but you cannot fight truth and win.
    <br>God is the only One who can expose fake.
    <br>Satan is fake; he cannot expose himself.
    <br>Anything the children of God have, satan has the photocopy which cannot stand the test of time.
    <br>He is fake.
    <br>So, I conclude with the following words:
    <br>Stop fighting the truth because the truth does not lose the battle.
    <br>I mean, God does not lose the battle.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whoever you are, whatever your status or stature in society,
    <br>remember that one day you too will face the test of legitimacy.
    <br>People of God, don't wait for that question before you repent and run to God.
    <br>Don't wait for that question before you repent and return to truth.
    <br>May God bless His holy Word in the midst of our hearts
    <br>as we abide by this message, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
