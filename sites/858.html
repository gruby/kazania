  <p>    
    <br>There is a man here; you are alleged that you killed a man.
    <br>I want you to come out.
    <br>Not only one; I see two children of yours who died in the process.
    <br>Come out.
    <br>Something happened. It's like you people were in the house.
    <br>Is it a new house? Are they celebrating in the house?
    <br>Which kind of occasion are they doing in a new house?
    <br>And something suddenly entered through the window and there was a storm.
    <br>Suddenly, almost three people died while they were praying.
    <br>Please, come out! Jesus loves you.
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua delivered a detailed prophecy of a strange event that took place,
    <br>a man boldly marched out towards the prophet.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>My name is Ubong Emah Willie.
    <br>I'm from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>I bought land many years ago.
    <br>I built a house and roofed three rooms out of it.
    <br>Then I invited a man of God to come and pray.
    <br>Immediately the pastor began to pray, an evil spirit entered the house,
    <br>killing my two children. And the pastor also died.
    <br>Who are they saying is the cause?
    <br>They said that I was the cause.
    <br>And they want to kill you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I want to stand here and tell them that those who are responsible for that, they are there.
    <br>Not only will this issue be settled but they will be exposed.
    <br>Akwa Ibom people - thank God you people know what the Lord of T.B. Joshua can do.
    <br>Because they have seen it and not one, not two, not three.
    <br>I want to tell you that this man does not know anything.
    <br>Lord, thank You, Jesus. It's true.
    <br>He knows nothing about this death.
    <br>The person that sent that evil spirit is a poor person.
    <br>Right from the beginning, you had problems with the land.
    <br>Yes, any time I went to church, they would tell me that the land is not good.
    <br>I don't really know but my pastor would always pray.
    <br>I want to say something.
    <br>The pastor that went there to pray for you, he used his two legs to walk there?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Was he sick before?
    <br>No.
    <br>Ha!
    <br>Even the two children of mine were not sick either.
    <br>Your children were not sick?
    <br>They were not sick.
    <br>Ok, it's alright.
    <br>This is a dangerous mission.
    <br>That is evil spirit for you.
    <br>If you cannot deliver them, they will deliver you.
    <br>When the man could not deliver them, they delivered him.
    <br>This man is not a wizard; he's purely nothing.
    <br>He is just a human being, just like you people.
    <br>After that thing had happened, there was a place they wanted you to go to.
    <br>You wanted to follow them but later, you said, "No".
    <br>That is why they said that you are the one who killed them.
    <br>I don't know what they call the place.
    <br>They said that I should come with them to a place but I refused to follow them.
    <br>The pastor you invited, that died in your house, what did you ask him to come and do for you?
    <br>I asked him to come and pray for me that I wanted to move into my new house.
    <br>Ok. You asked him to follow you to come and pray for you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Because you wanted to move into the house?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Immediately they started praying...
    <br>...the evil spirit entered.
    <br>What kind of prayer did the pastor offer before the evil spirit entered?
    <br>The pastor said that the land was not good,
    <br>that there was an evil spirit there and that we should pray to God to ward it off.
    <br>I am a witness. I am from his village.
    <br>My name is Ikpe Friday, I am from his village.
    <br>We thought that he used his children for money rituals.
    <br>Ok. All the villagers?
    <br>All the villagers thought that he used the children for money rituals.
    <br>He did not use them for rituals.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank God!
    <br>Let's go.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>The truth is further revealed as a man from Mr Ubong's village comes out to testify
    <br>that the prophecy given is nothing but the truth.
    <br>I am a brother to this man. He cannot speak well.
    <br>When this thing happened, the local Government Paramount Ruler sent
    <br>a committee and investigation committee on this matter.
    <br>The thing took us to Bayelsa State where we consulted a witch doctor,
    <br>though he did not go with us, I went.
    <br>The witch doctor said that the man was not involved,
    <br>that the problem came from the land.
    <br>By the time we came back to the village in Akwa Ibom State,
    <br>nobody believed; instead, they wanted to crucify this man. He ran.
    <br>Then at the end, the Paramount Ruler said that the only place he believed
    <br>that they would resolve this problem and by the time he said something,
    <br>everybody would believe was T.B. Joshua at The SCOAN.
    <br>O thank you people of Akwa Ibom. What an honour and what a privilege!
    <br>Thank you once again and I want to say to the people of Akwa Ibom,
    <br>any time I am praying, I will always remember you in prayer
    <br>for the honour and privilege given to me.
    <br>I know many things have happened in the past.
    <br>But for you to believe God,
    <br>that if I say something, it is from above, thank you very much for that.
    <br>So, you have someone praying for you.
    <br>So, you have been to many places?
    <br>Yes, of course. We went to a place in Bayelsa State.
    <br>What did they say?
    <br>The witch doctor said that this man was innocent,
    <br>though the man himself did not come.
    <br>By the time we came back, we told the chief in the village what the witch doctor said.
    <br>Nobody believed; instead they wanted to kill this man.
    <br>Already, the corpse of the pastor is not yet buried,
    <br>although his two kids have been buried.
    <br>The community now said that the son of that pastor should be a witness to our trip; he is seated there.
    <br>Where is the son?
    <br>The son of the pastor is at the back.
    <br>Please go and bring him.
    <br>Victor!
    <br>The son of the pastor is in the church here to witness the whole thing,
    <br>before they kill the man.
    <br>Victor, please come!
    <br>Let us watch the screen.
    <br>You have heard it from the man explaining as an eye witness all that happened in the village.
    <br>He said that when this matter came up, everyone in the village believed
    <br>that this man was responsible for the death of the pastor
    <br>and also had used his children for ritual.
    <br>They went to many places to investigate the cause of this
    <br>and they were told that this man was innocent
    <br>but no one believed it in the whole village
    <br>and that was how they all came together in the village...
    <br>This is the son of the late pastor and this man represents the Local Government.
    <br>He's the man the paramount ruler said should come with us,
    <br>while I represent the actual community where this thing happened.
    <br>Are you the son of the pastor?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>So, we heard what happened to your father. Can you tell us what happened?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Victor Anthony.
    <br>I so much thank God; God changed my life.
    <br>Before, I would do something like a mad person.
    <br>If I heard any problem, I would run there.
    <br>When I heard that my father was dead, I was annoyed -
    <br>I was annoyed with this guy.
    <br>When I asked my mum, she told me that this was the person
    <br>who came to invite my father to his house.
    <br>I asked, "How come he invited my father to his house? To do what?"
    <br>She said, "This man went to pick up prophets from different places
    <br>and then took my father to his house to pray for his house".
    <br>I asked, "What did the man put inside his house that he invited my father to come and pray over?"
    <br>God did not give my father the gift of prayer but a pastoral gift.
    <br>My father was a pastor.
    <br>Didn't I say that it was a dangerous mission.
    <br>You know that I said it?
    <br>I have never heard from him that his father was not a prayer warrior.
    <br>The son is saying that he never knew his father to be a prayer warrior.
    <br>Why should they call his father to come and pray?
    <br>She said this guy's two children died.
    <br>When I heard that, I was shocked.
    <br>They told me that my father was in the hospital.
    <br>I ran to the hospital to see my father; my father was dead.
    <br>I brought my father to the church.
    <br>They prayed for my father but there was no solution.
    <br>Some people came from other places.
    <br>Before then, I used to be hot-tempered.
    <br>People told me that we should go and burn the man's house and cause problems in the whole town.
    <br>I said, "No, let us do it like this, let us follow peace before anything".
    <br>Because I'm not like I used to be, so we tried to make peace.
    <br>I met the guy and they arranged to come and dress my father.
    <br>I even made a list of what this guy would use to bury my father.
    <br>And the list that I made was up to 4 million naira.
    <br>Can we just remain silent and hear God's will concerning this matter?
    <br>I said this because I asked my elders whether
    <br>anything like this had happened before. They said, "No".
    <br>Since I was born, I have never seen that kind of thing myself.
    <br>When a man of God goes to pray for a person and an evil power enters the house and kills people.
    <br>If you see those people and you are told that they were killed by an evil spirit,
    <br>you will never believe it; you will think that they were hit by a physical human being like me.
    <br>Because it was as if a heated piece of iron was used to beat them.
    <br>When such a piece of iron is used on a person, his skin would peel.
    <br>The two children of his that were hit by the evil spirit
    <br>were battered in the head and their brains spilled out.
    <br>If you saw them, you would not say that it was evil power that did this.
    <br>You would just say that it was a hired killer that had done it.
    <br>This thing happened in a way I do not understand.
    <br>That is why I said this guy should come and bury my father.
    <br>Even this place I came, people said that I shouldn't come here with him,
    <br>that I should just wait until he settled his problem
    <br>before he would come back and bury my father and take care of my late father's wife and children.
    <br>This is a very serious matter.
    <br>You can see the condition that followed.
    <br>Please, let us once and for all settle this matter.
    <br>One thing you people have to know, evil spirits, when they operate,
    <br>you will not see them but those who are in the spirit will see them.
    <br>They come out like a human being; they too use guns.
    <br>They can use a gun to kill too.
    <br>By the time the person dies, you will see the gunshot in the body.
    <br>They can use a cutlass but you will not see anybody.
    <br>But by the time the person lies down in body, you will see that it was a cutlass they used.
    <br>Sometimes, they may not use anything and the person will just die like that.
    <br>You will not see any trace of hitting, cutlass, knife but --
    <br>My brother, I want to declare to you that this brother is not a wizard.
    <br>So, there were some evil spirits that used that occasion to strike.
    <br>Now, concerning caring for your family and everything,
    <br>I don't want you to attach any condition.
    <br>I want to meet you so that we iron everything out.
    <br>But what matters is that this man is not the one that killed your father.
    <br>He is not an evil spirit; he is not a wizard.
    <br>I thank people in Akwa Ibom for bringing this matter here today.
    <br>I am very happy with them.
    <br>When I leave here today, I am going to pray for the State, Akwa Ibom.
    <br>This man is not a wizard.
    <br>He is not the one who killed your father. He is innocent.
    <br>But I will join you and your family; let's see what we can do.
    <br>He will not just fold his hands; he also has to support your family, do something.
    <br>But not by condition, since he is not the one who killed.
    <br>He must do something but I want to join force to support your family,
    <br>pray with your family and help your family financially and spiritually to restore the house.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. God loves me.
    <br>How many junior brothers do you have?
    <br>I have six.
    <br>Please, the words of mouth cannot just settle this matter like that.
    <br>I want to relieve this man from the condition, since he is not the one that killed your father.
    <br>In order to give him a great relief so that he will be out of this stiff condition,
    <br>personally, I am going to give you N500,000.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>So, if this man gives you N50,000, N100,000, please take it
    <br>because he is not the one that killed your father.
    <br>He will show love to really show
    <br>that he is really sorry for inviting your father for prayer and whatever.
    <br>He will feel what you feel.
    <br>But giving you N500,000 is a way of telling you
    <br>that you should remove that condition - that he must do this, he must do that - remove it.
    <br>So please, personally, I want to see your mum, your family and your children.
    <br>So, personally, this is my support.
    <br>I will give the family N500,000 to start something and put the matter behind them.
    <br>Brother, see the work your father went there to do as the work of God.
    <br>The nature of death does not matter.
    <br>Whether they kill you by plane crash or they crucify you or behead you,
    <br>what matters is the righteousness of God.
    <br>Two: The age at which we die does not matter.
    <br>Whether you are young or old, you are this, you are that, that does not matter.
    <br>The righteousness of God is the one that matters.
    <br>I want you to respect your father.
    <br>He went on a mission to pray and for your father to rest in peace,
    <br>please take it in that way - that he went on a mission.
    <br>Whether he was a prayer warrior or not, he went on a mission
    <br>to pray for somebody and in the process, something happened.
    <br>Say, "Glory be to God!"
    <br>But what matters, if this man is a wizard, I will tell you.
    <br>Now, I will tell you.
    <br>But I see nothing. He is not a wizard; he is nobody.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>That house, without deliverance, if another person enters that place again,
    <br>the same thing will happen. I am telling you, the same thing will happen.
    <br>Somebody was buried there before you built the house. There is a grave there.
    <br>We were told that 50 people would die inside that house.
    <br>For your information, the place needs to be sanctified.
    <br>If not, another person will die.
    <br>I want to pray for the people of Akwa-Ibom, the king there in the community and the council.
    <br>Thank you very much for this matter, for the soul and the peace we allow to reign
    <br>and also for coming to the root of the matter.
    <br>This man is not a wizard.
    <br>If he is a wizard, I will just tell you and he will be delivered. Simple.
    <br>Even if he is a wizard - I will tell you he is a wizard, I will deliver him.
    <br>I will come to the village and say, "Look leave him, he is already delivered".
    <br>So, the answer is not to kill the wizard but to deliver them.
    <br>But looking at him, I cannot see anything to be delivered, he is not a wizard.
    <br>Therefore, he is innocent; he doesn't know anything.
    <br>There is a pot in that place. They buried a pot; there is a charm there.
    <br>It works with thunder.
    <br>SHOCKING: Did This Man Kill His Own Children???
    <br>I want to meet the family, hand over my N500,000 and also support the family.
    <br>This man, like I have said, is just innocent.
    <br>They should pray for him because he's confused, so that he will not run mental.
    <br>They are trying him now.
    <br>He has been crying throughout the night.
    <br>This man? - Yes.
    <br>Because I see that he wants to run mental. When he runs mental,
    <br>they will now say that he is the one that killed them.
    <br>Whereas it is depression - depression wants to kill him.
    <br>He is not normal anymore. You will see him, he will be talking alone.
    <br>He needs to be delivered.
    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>My name is Ubong Emah Willie.
    <br>I come from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>The man of God prophesied that there was a man here
    <br>whose two children died.
    <br>He said that one of the pastors also died.
    <br>The man of God also prophesied that I called a man of God to come and pray in my house.
    <br>Immediately he started to pray, an evil spirit entered the house
    <br>and killed two of my children and the pastor.
    <br>There is a man here; you are alleged that you killed a man.
    <br>I want you to come out.
    <br>Not only one; I see two children of yours who died in the process.
    <br>Come out.
    <br>Something happened.
    <br>It's like, you people were in the house.
    <br>Is it a new house? Are they celebrating in the house?
    <br>Which kind of occasion are they doing in a new house?
    <br>And something suddenly entered through the window, and there was a storm.
    <br>Suddenly, almost three people died while they were praying.
    <br>Please, come out! Jesus loves you.
    <br>So, everything the man of God said is true.
    <br>So now, can you confirm to us this prophecy from the man of God.
    <br>Why did you say the prophecy of the man of God is true for your life? What happened?
    <br>The prophecy of the man of God is very true because the thing happened just like that.
    <br>Immediately we entered the house, we started to pray.
    <br>An evil spirit entered the house.
    <br>All of us fell down; then two children of mine died.
    <br>Then the pastor died also.
    <br>The other people sustained injuries, even I also had an injury.
    <br>Something beat us but we couldn't see it physically.
    <br>So, the prophecy of the man of God is very, very true.
    <br>Since after that incident happened,
    <br>can you tell us what happened to you in the village, in the community?
    <br>I was accused of killing my two children and the pastor.
    <br>So, they wanted to kill me but I escaped.
    <br>Later, the head of the village advised me to come back.
    <br>Later, the head of the clan told me to get N100,000
    <br>and travel to Lagos - four of us - to meet the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Ok. So, you mean this was the problem that brought you to The SCOAN, all the way from Akwa Ibom State?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok. Now we want to listen to the people standing beside you. Who are these people?
    <br>They are my brothers who the villagers assigned to accompany me to Lagos.
    <br>Ok. Let us listen to the men who are with you.
    <br>Can you please tell us your name and where you come from.
    <br>My name is Imoh Akpan Phenson.
    <br>I am from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>When this ugly incident happened, the whole community was in chaos.
    <br>The clan head then set an investigation committee to investigate
    <br>what had happened; that he had never seen this kind of thing before.
    <br>Actually, we have consulted a witch doctor at Bonni Local Government area of Rivers State.
    <br>We have consulted so many prophets and pastors.
    <br>All the revelations have always been that there is a problem in the land
    <br>on which this man built the house.
    <br>So, nobody believed this; the community never believed.
    <br>At the end, the clan head, having set up a committee, asked the man in question
    <br>Mr Ubong Emma Willie, the owner of the house, to find at least N100,000
    <br>so that we could take a trip to The SCOAN and see the man of God
    <br>and that whatever the man of God said about this, everybody would believe it.
    <br>This thing happened in a town hall meeting, a community hall,
    <br>that was where the decision was taken.
    <br>You mean all the reports given were not believed by the members of the community?
    <br>Yes. Nobody in the community believed that this man was innocent.
    <br>But by the time we arrived at The SCOAN, it was a very surprising thing
    <br>to see the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prophesying that there is a man
    <br>from Akwa Ibom State who is being accused of killing his two children
    <br>and a man, totalling three people, that the man should come out.
    <br>My brother, Mr Ubong, came out and the man of God even prophesied
    <br>that we have been to so many places including a native doctor's.
    <br>So, it was a surprising thing to me.
    <br>That's why I have to believe all that the man of God has said.
    <br>He has said that there is a poor man in the community.
    <br>The owners of the land have buried a pot in the ground.
    <br>That the pot is bringing all these upheavals in the house.
    <br>That if the house is not sanctified before living in it,
    <br>more people will still die.
    <br>That was the prophecy of the man of God.
    <br>Even as we are here, the clan head has even called us
    <br>that he had been watching us live; that the whole community too was watching.
    <br>We have been receiving phone calls since the prophecy of the man of God.
    <br>They have received thousands of phone calls from members of the community
    <br>and even from the clan head himself, who initiated this movement to The SCOAN,
    <br>that they have heard the voice of God
    <br>and indeed they believe that what the man of God said was nothing but the truth.
    <br>Can you tell us who the man next to you is?
    <br>The man next to me is the son of the late pastor, who is brought by the community as a witness
    <br>so that he will also believe what the man of God will say.
    <br>Right now let us listen to our gentleman here.
    <br>Can you please introduce yourself to us.
    <br>My name is Victor Anthony Kiddy.
    <br>I am the son of the late pastor.
    <br>I came here on a visit to hear what the man of God will say about this man who fell a victim.
    <br>I came here to know how this guy killed my father.
    <br>But the man of God let me know that this man is innocent.
    <br>As for me, I love God, so what the man of God told me, I believe it.
    <br>Because God cannot tell lies.
    <br>Now the man of God told me to leave the accused man alone
    <br>and he promised to give me N500,000 and also to take care of my family.
    <br>So now I believe what the man of God said that this man is innocent.
    <br>I believe because God cannot tell lies.
    <br>I am Uyoata Ndeayo Uttah.
    <br>I am a representative of the clan.
    <br>With absolute humility and respect to God Almighty and Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for what I have seen today.
    <br>Brethren, the story you have heard and the revelation you have seen today are wonderful.
    <br>I want to believe since we have witnessed that wonderful revelation,
    <br>we will still go back home and tell people.
    <br>I think so many people will believe.
    <br>I also want to thank the clan head, whom through his rulership, has sent us to this place.
    <br>He has really informed us that when we come to this place,
    <br>the truth about this matter will be revealed.
    <br>So I want to thank God and thank the man of God for having that privilege
    <br>and that opportunity to listen to us.
    <br>Today, we have seen the truth and the truth has been told.
    <br>To God be the glory! We thank God for everything.
    <br>Let us hear from this man. Tell us your name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ikpe Friday.
    <br>I am from Akwa Ibom (Nigeria).
    <br>I was down there, when I heard this prophecy.
    <br>The man of God said there is a man that built a house, they went to pray in the house --
    <br>So you mean you were in the church when the man of God prophecied to this young man?
    <br>Tell us what happened after that.
    <br>Immediately when I heard it, I ran out because it concerns me.
    <br>We thought this guy used his children for rituals, for money making.
    <br>I am from that community, I witnessed everything that happened.
    <br>Evil spirits entered the house and killed two of his children on the spot.
    <br>So, we were so surprised; we thought he used the children for money rituals.
    <br>I personally thank God that we have to got to know the truth;
    <br>the truth has come out today so that we now know this man is innocent.
    <br>Thank you very much. Indeed, we thank God for this wonderful prophecy
    <br>that has come today and the truth that has been revealed.
    <br>As the spirit of God has spoken, we also thank God that everyone concerned in this matter
    <br>has heeded the voice of God and believed that the man of God has spoken the mind of God
    <br>concerning this situation,
    <br>and we want to give glory to God Almighty for the peace He has brought in this issue today.
    <br>Thank you all also for taking the time to come here to find out the truth.
    <br>Thank you very much. God bless you.
    <br>As directed by Prophet T.B. Joshua, the following Sunday, Mr Ubong is at The SCOAN
    <br>with the late pastor's wife, son and some village representatives
    <br>who were present when the evil attack took place.
    <br>My name is Ubong Emah Willie.
    <br>I come from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>Last week Sunday, I was in The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God prophesied that there was a man here from Akwa Ibom
    <br>who built a house and called a pastor to pray in the new house.
    <br>Then an evil spirit entered through the window, killed his children and the pastor.
    <br>There is a man here; you are alleged that you killed a man.
    <br>I want you to come out.
    <br>Not only one; I see two children of yours who died in the process.
    <br>Come out.
    <br>Something happened.
    <br>It's like, you people were in the house.
    <br>Is it a new house? Are they celebrating in the house?
    <br>Which kind of occasion are they doing in a new house?
    <br>And something suddenly entered through the window and there was a storm.
    <br>Suddenly, almost three people died while they were praying.
    <br>Please come out! Jesus loves you.
    <br>What the man of God said is true.
    <br>I bought land and built a house on it.
    <br>Then I called a pastor to come and pray for me because I wanted to move into the new house.
    <br>As we began to pray, an evil spirit entered the house and killed two of my children.
    <br>We were all beaten but we couldn't see the person who beat us.
    <br>There was a flood of water inside the room where we were praying.
    <br>Then all of us fell down.
    <br>Even my brother fell down and his hand was wounded.
    <br>So, we took the pastor to the church, from the church to the hospital,
    <br>from the hospital back to the church. Then later, the pastor died.
    <br>After the death of the pastor, I was accused of using my children and the pastor for a money ritual.
    <br>So, the entire village and the clan said I killed my children and the pastor.
    <br>They wanted to kill me.
    <br>I ran away from the village.
    <br>After I had left, the village head later sent a message to me through my in-law
    <br>that anywhere I was, I should come back. Then I came back.
    <br>Then the village head told me that the only place where the truth could come out
    <br>was through Prophet T.B. Josua at The SCOAN.
    <br>So, on Sunday, I entered the church.
    <br>Immediately I entered the church, I started praying to God
    <br>that God should come and visit me and open my file.
    <br>Immediately I started to pray in my heart, Prophet T.B. Joshua, the man of God, prophesied
    <br>that there is a man here from Akwa Ibom who bought a land and built a house.
    <br>Then this man called a pastor there to exorcise the house.
    <br>Then an evil spirit entered, killing two children of his and the pastor.
    <br>That person is here and he should come out.
    <br>So, I stood up and shouted that it was me.
    <br>Then the man of God told me everything,
    <br>saying that I was not the one who killed them; that I was innocent.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Victor Anthony Kiddy.
    <br>I am the son of the late pastor.
    <br>This is my stepmother, the pastor's wife.
    <br>What brought me here is to listen to what God has to say about this man who killed my father.
    <br>When I came here, God used the man of God to speak to me that the man is innocent.
    <br>And I believe because what God told me is not a lie.
    <br>I had planned that even if this man is innocent or a victim,
    <br>he would give me 4 million naira to bury my father.
    <br>But now, God used the man of God to help him to take care of my father's burial.
    <br>I so much thank God for what He used the man of God to do for me.
    <br>My name is Uyoata Ndeayo Uttah.
    <br>I am the representative of the clan where this incident happened,
    <br>in Nna Local Government, Akwa Ibom State.
    <br>And here standing close to me is the wife of the pastor that died during the incident.
    <br>She will speak in our local language; then I will interpret.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Comfort Anthony Kiddy
    <br>She said she is Comfort Anthony Kiddy from Nna Local Government, Akwa Ibom State.
    <br>I was there in the house.
    <br>My husband told me that he wanted to go and pray.
    <br>My close friend.
    <br>I waited in my house for two days. My husband never came back.
    <br>For three days, I waited and waited but he never came back home.
    <br>I never knew he was taken to the hospital.
    <br>I went to the hospital and brought him back to the church.
    <br>The following Friday, my husband died - the pastor.
    <br>Since then, I have not been able to do anything;
    <br>rather, I have been weeping and weeping and I have decided to leave everything to God Almighty.
    <br>But on Sunday, when I was informed about the happening in my village
    <br>and later, that the accused person was innocent,
    <br>I could not do anything. I decided to leave everything for God.
    <br>My beloved brethren, I thank the man of God because what I initially thought
    <br>was that Mr Ubong Emah would bury my husband and take care of my family
    <br>and do everything for my family.
    <br>But when I was told last Sunday, I realised that this man is innocent.
    <br>I thank God and I thank the man of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Please, what I want to tell my Christian brethren is that Mr Ubong
    <br>will take care of my mother's burial which my late husband was supposed to have done.
    <br>That is what I want him to do.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Bassey Monday Udoh from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>One day, I was sitting in my shop when I heard a call,
    <br>"Brother, come; please, I want to see you immediately.
    <br>Wherever you are, I will pay for your transport".
    <br>So, I decided to rush down. On my way, I met this relation of mine.
    <br>So, I followed him into his house.
    <br>When we got to his house, I saw people who came to pray.
    <br>All of them are my friends; I know them.
    <br>When we were praying, an evil spirit came in and beat us
    <br>and gave me a very big wound as a result of which
    <br>I cannot raise up my hand up 'til now.
    <br>I cannot use my hand to write or do anything.
    <br>This is making two months and three weeks.
    <br>I use my left hand to eat; I cannot take my bath.
    <br>So, what happened to me in that house was that when we were praying,
    <br>an evil spirit came in the form of wind.
    <br>Then the thing was like tear gas whereby no one could open their eyes.
    <br>So, everybody fainted.
    <br>We didn't know where we were.
    <br>This man said, "Let us go and open the door".
    <br>He tried to open the door seven times; the door would not open again until 5pm,
    <br>before this guy took us to the church.
    <br>What happened to my hand is that they used a hammer to destroy my hand.
    <br>Up 'til now, I cannot bend my hand or touch anything.
    <br>The same evil spirit has destroyed my hair.
    <br>Up 'til now, my hair cannot grow on this spot anymore.
    <br>We have listened to their testimony, their confession.
    <br>Mummy, we invited you here today to let you know that this man is just innocent.
    <br>There is nothing like witchcraft in him.
    <br>So, someone is somewhere perpetrating this evil.
    <br>So, like I have said, I will support the family.
    <br>Don't cry; you just take me as your brother and son.
    <br>I will be part of your family.
    <br>From now on, you just call me in position of your husband -
    <br>whatever you feel your husband was supposed to have done or would do if alive.
    <br>So, call me; I will come into the matter.
    <br>Just let this man be free and forget about that
    <br>since he does not possess evil powers and he is innocent.
    <br>So, we should not bother him.
    <br>As a Christian, he should be coming to visit you and also see you as part of the family
    <br>but nothing should be compelled or forced on him.
    <br>So, I'm going to support the family. I know you have many children.
    <br>I'm going to support your family with N500,000.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>He is the father, he is the husband now.
    <br>So, I'm indirectly telling you that I'm going to join you. Okay?
    <br>After blessing the family of the deceased with half a million naira,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for the son and his mother.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>So that you will be able to stand as the head of the home.
    <br>He prays for the son to enable him to stand, now as the head of the home.
    <br>That is Mr Ubong himself receiving deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Who is this man?
    <br>This man is one of the victims.
    <br>Is he a pastor?
    <br>No, he is not a pastor; he is one of those who participated in the prayer.
    <br>Are you a prayer warrior?
    <br>I'm not a prayer warrior. This man is my relation.
    <br>We are from the same family.
    <br>You went there to do what?
    <br>We were there together.
    <br>To clap hands?
    <br>At least, to clap hands.
    <br>He said he went there to clap hands.
    <br>To eat rice or what?
    <br>I went there to pray with those who came to dedicate the house.
    <br>You have been doing that in the past?
    <br>Yes, when I was in the prayer band in the Apostolic Church.
    <br>That time, I was in secondary school.
    <br>So, we used to go to people's shops - to dedicate their shops.
    <br>After that, we would go back to the church.
    <br>Thank God you are here to hear the voice of God.
    <br>This man is not responsible for the death of your husband. He is just a victim.
    <br>He is not a wizard.
    <br>This man should be free.
    <br>At the same time, your husband was a pastor.
    <br>You should accept that he went for the call of God.
    <br>If you don't believe that, it means you don't believe your husband was a pastor.
    <br>You should see the death of your husband as a blessing because he was a pastor.
    <br>They should put this money in the bank. I will continue to support them.
    <br>Make sure the children go to school; and take care of the house.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>We thank Jesus. If this issue was not brought here and this man was killed,
    <br>how much can buy the soul and the body?
    <br>Because that would have been the penalty.
    <br>What we are doing is to send you back to the city and your community.
    <br>Help the needy.
    <br>There's no amount of money given that is enough for what God is using us to settle.
    <br>This is what would have taken life.
    <br>But God used us to settle the matter.
    <br>How much is N500,000? It is small money but for us to settle the matter, glory be to God.
    <br>There is no case anymore.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Ubong Emah Willie.
    <br>I come from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>My heart is full of joy because I didn't expect that when I come here,
    <br>the man of God would prophesy that I am innocent.
    <br>So, I am very, very happy for Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Then on Wednesday, the man of God called us and gave us N45,000 for transport home
    <br>to bring the late pastor's wife.
    <br>So, I am happy; I am very, very happy.
    <br>I thank my God and Prophet T.B. Joshua for delivering me.
    <br>My name is Victor Anthony Kiddy.
    <br>I so much thank God for what He has done for me.
    <br>He used the man of God to speak well to me.
    <br>He said that the man I wanted to hang is innocent.
    <br>I believe what God said to me.
    <br>I cannot deny it. I will believe what God said.
    <br>He gave me N500,000 to go and do my father's burial.
    <br>I so much thank God.
    <br>He also told me that he's going to take care of my family and my father's wife.
    <br>I'm so happy.
    <br>The man of God gave me money to go and do the burial
    <br>and take care of my brothers and my father's wife.
    <br>I am Uyoata Ndeayo Uttah from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>I am a representative of the clan.
    <br>Beloved Christian brethren, I thank God with absolute humility and honour to God Almighty
    <br>and the Prophet of God, the communicator, the mediator, the prophet in God's vineyard.
    <br>I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for the wonderful prophecy he has given in this case.
    <br>Beloved brethren, we came here last Sunday and we saw what happened.
    <br>When we went back to the village, everybody was convinced.
    <br>Now it is clear that the truth has been spoken.
    <br>It has cleared everybody's mind in our local government and the clan.
    <br>When we went back to the village the other time, it was celebration galore.
    <br>Everybody was happy about the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>So, I thank God for that in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>They accepted in good faith that what the man of God prophesied was correct and the truth.
    <br>That Mr Ubong is innocent.
    <br>So you are here in the service today
    <br>and you witnessed what the anointed man of God did for the family of the late pastor.
    <br>What do you have to say about that?
    <br>Yes, I am very, very glad about what I have seen today -
    <br>the presentation of N500,000 to the family of the deceased, the pastor.
    <br>I thank God because it is not easy.
    <br>Even politicians cannot do this.
    <br>I know what is happening in the world now.
    <br>I thank God because it takes a lot of time and sweat for somebody to give such a gift.
    <br>So, I want to thank God because I have seen that this place is God's vineyard.
    <br>So, I thank God for that.
    <br>Having witnessed all these things that God Almighty has done,
    <br>the reconciliation between the families and also the cash gift,
    <br>that was given to the late pastor's family,
    <br>what word of advice do you have for people listening to you,
    <br>most especially the people back in the village?
    <br>What word of advice do you have for them?
    <br>Please, my advice to the people listening to me and the entire world is
    <br>that when anything happens, you have to look before you leap.
    <br>It is very, very important.
    <br>It is not easy for you to accuse somebody.
    <br>Then at the tail end, you discover that that person is not the perpetrator;
    <br>he doesn't have any hand in that case.
    <br>So, I thank God for everything.
    <br>That when anything happens, you have to look before you leap.
    <br>Comfort Anthony Kiddy
    <br>She said she is Comfort Anthony Kiddy from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>We want to hear from her what happened today,
    <br>what God has done in her family, most especially in her life.
    <br>She said she is thankful to God Almighty and Prophet T.B. Joshua for the wonderful prophecy
    <br>that was revealed to us, and she is seriously impressed about the gift
    <br>of N500,000 to the family and believes that they will make use of the N500,000 judiciously.
    <br>My name is Bassey Monday Udoh.
    <br>I am from Akwa Ibom State (Nigeria).
    <br>What happened to me is something incurable because the thing happened unexpectedly.
    <br>I sustained a very serious injury, which I took to many places -
    <br>almost three herbalists - they could not heal my hand.
    <br>I spent a lot of money but they still could not heal my hand.
    <br>But I'm very happy today because the man of God prayed for me and healed me.
    <br>I'm normal now; I can do anything.
    <br>I also thank the man of God for the good thing he has done to help my friend
    <br>to take care of the incident.
    <br>The man of God has done a lot.
    <br>Giving them N500,000 is not an easy thing.
    <br>God bless that man continuously, in Jesus' name.
    <br>So, as the man of God said during the service that they should place you at the prayer line,
    <br>that he will pray for you, he actually prayed for you
    <br>and all this severe pain and problems are gone now.
    <br>Yes, all those things went out from me.
    <br>I feel very fine now.
    <br>We give thanks to God Almighty for what He has done.
    <br>Let us hear from the son of the pastor again.
    <br>This is the N500,000 that the man of God gave me.
    <br>I thank him so much, in Jesus' name.
