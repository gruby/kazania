    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prophecy
    <br>& Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>She has depression.
    <br>It's true. She is my wife.
    <br>She's your wife?
    <br>Yes, Man of God. It's true.
    <br>From where?
    <br>We came from the United States.
    <br>The United States?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She has depression and she has suicidal thoughts.
    <br>It's true.
    <br>Having received a prophecy about the spirit of depression and suicidal thoughts,
    <br>this woman is delivered in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>My name is Thania Requeno and I'm from the United States.
    <br>This is my husband Akeem Jequeno.
    <br>This is my elder brother Minor
    <br>and this is my sister-in-Christ Elena.
    <br>This is my baby Caleb.
    <br>What brought me to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations was that I was seeking deliverance,
    <br>seeking breakthrough from stagnation and for my career.
    <br>We were here on January 1st for the New Year Service.
    <br>When the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua was ministering, he laid hands on me
    <br>and I manifested.
    <br>I didn't really know what happened. I saw myself on the floor.
    <br>He prophesied about a spirit of depression and suicidal thoughts.
    <br>When I reflect back on that, I can see how the spirit was attacking me.
    <br>I am more of a people person and
    <br>there would be some times where I would just want to run away from people,
    <br>from my family and after I got married, even from my husband.
    <br>I would isolate myself and go to places.
    <br>Sometimes I would just take my car and drive somewhere and park somewhere and cry.
    <br>Sometimes, I would go into the bathroom, turn the shower on and just cry in the shower.
    <br>I had this deep sorrow in my heart and I didn't really understand why
    <br>because I was born again three years ago and
    <br>my inner spirit would tell me that I was saved, that I believed in Jesus Christ.
    <br>But I still felt this pain, this sorrow, this very deep sorrow -
    <br>I don't know how to explain it - in my heart.
    <br>I would come out of it.
    <br>Sometimes I would argue with my husband, but then I would come out of it and
    <br>then I would come back to him and apologise.
    <br>We would even joke about it.
    <br>He would joke about it with me - "One moment, you're sad and the next moment, you are happy."
    <br>We would joke about it but in all honesty, it was something serious.
    <br>So, when the man of God laid hands on me and he spoke that, it made a lot of sense to me
    <br>and I understood that all those episodes I had were really attacks from the enemy.
    <br>I also remembered that when I came to Christ three years ago,
    <br>I had this supernatural joy over my life that even unbelievers would testify to.
    <br>They would ask me, 'Are you high right now? Are you drunk? Why are you so happy?'
    <br>I would testify and tell them that it was Jesus Christ. I would preach the Gospel.
    <br>Anywhere I went, people would notice that - believers, unbelievers and my family.
    <br>Somehow along the way, that joy left me.
    <br>And so, when the man of God laid hands on me, I know that that joy came back to me.
    <br>I just thank God because I want to testify that Jesus Christ is Lord and
    <br>tell people that there is hope and they don't have to suffer from depression,
    <br>that these are just spiritual things, not physical.
    <br>They are spiritual things that everybody goes through but not everybody knows the solution.
    <br>I just want to thank the Lord for The SCOAN and for the favour and grace over my life,
    <br>over my family's life, over the prophet and over The SCOAN
    <br>because there has just been so much favour since we came on January 1st this year
    <br>and I am excited to go back home tomorrow and taste the goodness of the Lord
    <br>and just to walk with Him.
    <br>Indeed, words of the mouth are not enough to really express deeply
    <br>what the Lord has done in your life, other than to say, 'Thank You, Jesus Christ'.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.
    <br>In other words, you are making us to realise that initially you came purposely
    <br>because you wanted financial breakthrough - that was what you came for.
    <br>And all of a sudden the Spirit of God went deep to the areas that were really troubling your life
    <br>but you never took seriously. Is that correct?
    <br>That is correct.
    <br>Like I said, I came for breakthrough from stagnation in my life
    <br>and for my career because I always saw a pattern in those things.
    <br>But the Bible says that God searches the depths of our hearts
    <br>and I know that that was what He did that day
    <br>because I was not expecting to have received that word.
    <br>I wanted to receive something about my career - the stagnation again
    <br>but the root of my problems with stagnation and in my career
    <br>was actually depression and suicidal thoughts.
    <br>I could continue and get breakthrough in my career but then not be delivered from depression
    <br>and I wouldn't be able to enjoy that or testify to the goodness of the Lord
    <br>and so I'm just thankful again for the word that I received,
    <br>for the prophecy and for the deliverance.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Ever since the prophecy came to pass in your life and you were delivered,
    <br>are you still having depression or suicidal thoughts?
    <br>What can you say about the state of your mind and your entire body right now?
    <br>I do not feel any depression. I have no suicidal thoughts.
    <br>I can feel the genuine joy in my spirit ever since the prophet laid hands on me.
    <br>The following day, we also went for prayer and I felt something leave my heart again.
    <br>I know that the joy is going to keep coming and coming
    <br>and I'll be able to share the Gospel and share Jesus Christ with everyone.
    <br>I'm thankful for that.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>We rejoice with you greatly.
    <br>Before we hear from you a word of advice for all and sundry,
    <br>we just want to hear from your husband.
    <br>Could you just introduce yourself to us and tell us your own side of the story.
    <br>Good Morning Church!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Akeem Jequenu.
    <br>I am from Benin Republic but I reside in the United States.
    <br>This is my wife Thania.
    <br>That's my brother-in-law Minor and that's our sister-in-Christ Elena.
    <br>Concerning the prophecy, the word that she received from the man of God is true.
    <br>When I first got married to her, it was something that she would hide from people. People didn't know.
    <br>But being alone in the house with her, I understood that something was going on in her life
    <br>because one moment she would be happy and the next moment, she would be very very sad.
    <br>She would hide and cry. Sometimes I would surprise her when she was crying.
    <br>Then she would make comments like, "I just feel like going somewhere and drinking".
    <br>So, I knew it wasn't normal.
    <br>Being a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, we went to some churches and a lot of places in the US.
    <br>Those big names in the Gospel in the US, we went there seeking help for this trouble.
    <br>But we couldn't find anybody to help.
    <br>I remembered my experience with the Lord a little bit before I met her.
    <br>When I was still in Africa, people used to talk about Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>but for me, I concluded he was not a man of God because of the things I heard from people.
    <br>Also he's not a sweet talker.
    <br>I listened to him one or two times and asked myself, "Who goes and sits down in his church?
    <br>What do they do there?"
    <br>I didn't really believe he was a man of God.
    <br>But then, when I was in the US, I went through some tough times,
    <br>some very rough times, moments of my life.
    <br>One day I was in New York and I went to one of these mega churches for someone to pray for me.
    <br>The white lady who was praying for me asked me where I was from.
    <br>I said I was from Benin Republic and she said, "Do you know T.B. Joshua? That's very close to your nation".
    <br>I said, "Yes, I know T.B. Joshua".
    <br>And she started talking about how beautiful his ministry is and
    <br>how there were deliverance and family reconciliations, helping the poor and scholarships for the needy.
    <br>And I was like, "'This T.B. Joshua is everywhere. Why is everybody always talking about T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>Mr & Mrs Thania Requeno & Family
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>It's true that I didn't say anything bad about him but in my heart, I knew that he was not a man of God.
    <br>So, later on, I went on a fast because things became very terrible for me,
    <br>I was going through difficult times and hardship.
    <br>I went on a fast for 21 days, just to seek the face of God about my situation and my life.
    <br>And then on the fifth day of my fast, I had a vision early in the morning.
    <br>In this vision, I saw the Lord Jesus Christ in one corner and then I was happy, I was going towards Him.
    <br>But He was pointing to the opposite direction.
    <br>And then I turned back to see and there was Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Thania Requeno & Family
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Still at that moment in the vision, I still convinced myself that, "This is not a man of God!"
    <br>So I looked at him and I turned back. I was walking to the Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>and He said, "No, go to him".
    <br>So I turned back and I went to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the most amazing spiritual experience of my life happened that day.
    <br>Because he was reading my mind and telling me everything that I needed to know
    <br>and teaching me great teachings that day,
    <br>Even from that experience only, I can testify that he is a man of God
    <br>because there was no way he could know all those things deep in my heart that he told me.
    <br>After that he told me, "I have been appointed to take care of you".
    <br>And I said, "Does that mean that you are my spiritual father?" And he said, "Yes".
    <br>And I said, "Does that mean that I will walk in the same element as my dad?"
    <br>And he said, "Yes" and started laughing.
    <br>I remembered in the vision that I didn't have my documents yet to leave the country and come back.
    <br>I was going to say, "Pray for me so I can go to The SCOAN. I want to come now".
    <br>And he was smiling as if it was already done and then I came out of that vision.
    <br>Later on, I went online and listened to his preaching.
    <br>I saw that it is true that he doesn't give motivational speeches but he speaks from the Spirit of God.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Thania Requeno & Family
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ. Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>I also saw other sides to the ministry and I believe that people in my position then,
    <br>didn't know that he was doing all these things.
    <br>But from one blackmail to another, people make up their minds that he is not a man of God.
    <br>I sent someone to The SCOAN, saying, "Get me the Anointing Water, the Sticker and everything you can get".
    <br>So my friend came here to Nigeria and he sent everything to me.
    <br>I was able to file for residency in the US and I sprinkled and I prayed; I started following him.
    <br>One night, I was listening to the Mass Prayer, the one that he does with viewers all over the world.
    <br>I was convinced that night.
    <br>I asked myself, "Why wouldn't I think that this was a man of God
    <br>because everything that comes from his mouth is from God?"
    <br>A kingdom divided against itself cannot prosper - that's what the Bible says.
    <br>If this man is of the devil, why is he casting out devils?
    <br>So, it is not possible that he does all these things if he's not from God.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Thania Requeno & Family
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So I told my wife and my brother-in-law, "This is the experience I have had with this man of God in Africa".
    <br>I said, "We are going to go there as soon as I get my documents" and that's what we did.
    <br>When I got my green card, my brother-in-law told me, "What are we waiting for? Let's go now".
    <br>So, we got our tickets and then we just came here.
    <br>And when you finally came to The SCOAN, could you just reflect on what happened to your wife
    <br>and the state of her mind after the prophecy and deliverance.
    <br>How can you confirm that to be true?
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>He's somebody who doesn't live with us.
    <br>If we had filed everything and talked about depression before we came here,
    <br>maybe we would doubt and think that this man just read what we had sent via email and said something.
    <br>But we didn't file anything; we just came on our own and sat at the back there.
    <br>And he came and directly pointed at the issue.
    <br>He said, "Depression and suicidal thoughts".
    <br>How in the world would you know that it was not the Lord who told you?
    <br>Ever since he prayed for her, she is delivered.
    <br>Now, she's happy; even I am happy.
    <br>I used to be so frustrated. My wife would always be happy and then sad. It was on my neck.
    <br>But now, she is free and we are all a very beautiful and happy family.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracleworking God!
    <br>To God be the glory, I think we have to hear from you before you leave.
    <br>Formerly you were doubting, you never believed that this man was from God
    <br>but after your conviction in the dream, what is your opinion of the prophet
    <br>and also, what is your advice for all and sundry?
    <br>This is what I will say.
    <br>The Bible says that man looks at the outward appearance but God looks at the heart.
    <br>God knows everything about everybody.
    <br>Instead of just picking words from here and there and making up your mind about people,
    <br>why don't you just go to God?
    <br>Because if we are real Christians, we should go to God before we judge anybody,
    <br>or before we say this is not that or this is not a man of God.
    <br>I would advise everybody to just seek God in every situation
    <br>and make sure that your mind when it is made up is from God and His opinion about people.
    <br>That's what I would say.
    <br>Thank you very much for that word of advice. Let's also hear a word of advice from your wife.
    <br>With all you have experienced, having been delivered from depression and suicidal thoughts,
    <br>what word of advice do you have for everyone?
    <br>I would advise to not seek help from people like doctors or therapists or rehabilitation.
    <br>I would say, just seek God.
    <br>Like my husband said, God sees everything. He sees the deep things. God sees the outer things.
    <br>Most of the problems we face have a spiritual force behind them.
    <br>So, if you don't deal with it spiritually, you are not going to find a solution.
    <br>So, don't seek physical help from doctors or a rehab for something that is spiritual.
    <br>You have to go to God because God is the Deliverer.
    <br>God can touch you, He can heal you. He healed me and God is not a respecter of persons.
    <br>He loves you. After all, it is out of love that He will heal you.
    <br>So seek God and don't seek man. Seek God alone for everything  and anything.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We believe you are trying to make us understand that we serve the God of nature
    <br>and medicine is from nature.
    <br>Doctors treat while Jesus Christ heals.
    <br>And you are telling us that if it comes to spiritual matters, we should seek the face of God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>Let's hear briefly from your brother-in-law. He may also have some things to contribute.
    <br>Could you just introduce yourself to us and tell us what you have to say about your sister's life.
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Minor Requeno. This is my sister Thania, my brother-in-law Akeem
    <br>and my sister-in-Christ Elena.
    <br>This is our first time in Africa and we are just really excited to be here because
    <br>we know that everything that has been going on is from God.
    <br>We actually came a little bit unprepared but God has come through the whole way.
    <br>I want to thank T.B. Joshua for being a true man of God.
    <br>In America and all over the world, there are a lot of false teachers, pastors and prophets.
    <br>But being here for a week and witnessing him and listening to him, I can tell the whole world that
    <br>that this is a man of God.
    <br>To God be the glory and what can you say about your sister, ever since she has been delivered?
    <br>In my family, I was the first one who got saved and she was the second one.
    <br>I witnessed her salvation. She was just like a glowing beam.
    <br>Everybody could testify that she was full of joy.
    <br>Gradually though, it started to diminish and go down a little bit.
    <br>Akeem was going through hard times, I was going through hard times, with Elena and my sister,
    <br>we all decided to come over here seeking something from the Lord through T.B. Joshua.
    <br>So when he pointed that out in my sister, I knew that it was God, especially seeing her on the ground.
    <br>I knew it was the Lord.
    <br>Ever since then, we are all just really excited and we're just taking that blessing by force; we really are.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Finally, what is your word of advice to everyone?
    <br>I would say just like everyone else is saying to open up our hearts.
    <br>Seek the Lord from a true heart and from the bottom of your hearts
    <br>because like they said, He searches the depths of our hearts and we can't fool Him.
    <br>So, if we can just talk to Him and go to Him from the bottom of our hearts,
    <br>I think He will answer us and He will see us through.
    <br>Thank you. Let's finally listen to our sister.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Elena De la Cruz and I'm from the United States.
    <br>This is my sister-in-Christ Thania with baby Caleb, Akeem, Minor - my brothers and sisters in Christ.
    <br>I didn't even know T.B. Joshua existed. I had no clue.
    <br>I was always skeptical about internet preachers and pastors
    <br>because there are a lot of fake ones out there.
    <br>When they were telling me some of their testimonies and dreams
    <br>and stuff they experienced with T.B. Joshua and who he was,
    <br>I just trusted in God.
    <br>I prayed to the Lord and asked if He wanted me to come here to Africa because this is my first time.
    <br>And He gave me a vision of us coming.
    <br>I said, "OK Lord - Your will, not mine".
    <br>It's faith that brought us all here.
    <br>It's faith that broke barriers where most people might have been scared to even come.
    <br>And it's faith, it's God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit that delivered my sister.
    <br>I had no idea she was depressed; I had no idea she had suicidal thoughts
    <br>but that's a wicked demonic spirit.
    <br>Just trusting in God for deliverance, not in people or psychotherapists or what he, she or it says.
    <br>Just the Lord Jesus Christ gives you true deliverance.
    <br>To sit back and watch T.B. Joshua and his ministry, I feel like its a modern-day of what we read in the Bible.
    <br>It gives us so much hope, that the Bible is alive today.
    <br>It's such a beautiful thing to see all of this and everybody coming together
    <br>for the ministry to really deliver people, so people can be set free, so those chains can be broken,
    <br>so my sister can continue growing in the Lord, so her joy can be reignited and she can continue
    <br>spreading God's Word everywhere she goes and planting seeds.
    <br>Even her testimony is going to set souls free and give other people hope.
    <br>I'm so thankful to be along for the ride and to witness all of this.
    <br>It's a blessing; I give God all the glory.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Briefly before you go, having experienced the goodness of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
    <br>through His able servant Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>what word of advice do you have for all who are listening to you?
    <br>Trust God. Read His Word on a regular basis, love, love, love.
    <br>It's very important to be in the spirit.
    <br>One thing I learnt from T.B. Joshua is to constantly pray in the spirit.
    <br>I didn't know you could do that.
    <br>Instead of having negative thoughts, etc. constantly stay in the spirit and pray in the spirit
    <br>before you go to bed, in the spirit.
    <br>Be in the spirit and know that the Holy Spirit in you can do all things.
    <br>Jesus Christ's death, burial and resurrection is just love. I love it.
    <br>I give Him all the glory.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Yes, it's been awesome.
    <br>As far as this family is concerned, it is a clear proof that everyone is going home hale and hearty
    <br>and with the goodness of the Lord.
    <br>I believe that by the time you get back to the United States of America,
    <br>you will continue to share your testimony with all who care to listen.
    <br>We also want to admonish you by letting you know that
    <br>you have been healed, delivered and blessed through the Word of God.
    <br>Make sure you go back and make His Word the standard for your lives
    <br>and always have it at the back of your minds
    <br>that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come!
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
