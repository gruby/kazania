    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Look here! Stand up!
    <br>Stand up! Who are you?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am a snake.
    <br>You are a snake?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>Disappointment.
    <br>How? Explain!
    <br>I give her discouragements. There is no concentration at school.
    <br>I own her.
    <br>You as a snake, how did you enter her body?
    <br>I entered her body through friends.
    <br>Through friends?
    <br>Through friends she keeps.
    <br>I have a covenant with her.
    <br>What kind of covenant?
    <br>Tattoo covenant.
    <br>Tattoo covenant?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Where is that tattoo?
    <br>Why are you asking me?
    <br>I own her.
    <br>You said you have made a tattoo covenant with her.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Where is the tattoo?
    <br>I have a covenant with her.
    <br>Where is the tattoo?
    <br>It's on her back.
    <br>On her back?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How many powers do you have inside of her?
    <br>I have three powers.
    <br>Three powers?
    <br>Yes, three powers.
    <br>Mention them one by one!
    <br>I have on her legs, her two hands, and I use her body.
    <br>You use her body?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Those tattoos, when I have a covenant with her, she used to dream about me.
    <br>I am the snake of the marine spirit.
    <br>I am the snake.
    <br>The moment, I did the covenant with her, she started working for me.
    <br>In what way does she work for you?
    <br>She works for me by getting people for my kingdom.
    <br>She gets people for your kingdom?
    <br>She gets people for my kingdom.
    <br>How does she get people for your kingdom?
    <br>And soon, I will make her the queen.
    <br>How do you take people to your kingdom?
    <br>Through my legs when I am walking in the streets.
    <br>Whoever that looks at my body also comes to my feet
    <br>and when he comes to my feet, I take him to my kingdom.
    <br>Okay, walk the way you walk in the streets. Let's see!
    <br>They come to my kingdom.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>How many people have you taken to your kingdom so far?
    <br>I've taken a lot of people.
    <br>How do you use the power in her hands?
    <br>The power in my hands, I use it when she's angry. I gave her the spirit of anger.
    <br>Whenever she is angry or whenever you try to insult her,
    <br>she points her hands at you; then you are in my kingdom.
    <br>Okay, any person she points her hands at...
    <br>I use these two fingers.
    <br>You use it as what?
    <br>This is part of the power I gave her.
    <br>I use it to get people for my kingdom.
    <br>Every power that I gave her, the three powers that she has,
    <br>she uses them to get people for my kingdom.
    <br>The power in her legs is also part of her to also get people for my kingdom.
    <br>How?
    <br>By the way I walk.
    <br>You said, the body too has power?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How do you use that one?
    <br>The body - no one can resist her body.
    <br>Look at these people.
    <br>Who are these people to you?
    <br>I don't know anyone of them.
    <br>You don't know them?
    <br>Yes, I don't know anyone of them. I came alone.
    <br>You came alone?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>From where? Where did you come from?
    <br>Firstly, I came from the sea; she has the spirit of fish.
    <br>She can't sleep without putting her legs together
    <br>She doesn't sleep on one side; she sleeps straight up.
    <br>She sleeps straight up?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Ok, show us!
    <br>She plays at night. She comes to me.
    <br>We play at night in the river with other people in our kingdom there.
    <br>We play all together.
    <br>Can you show us the way she sleeps at night?
    <br>She sleeps like this. This is just the way she sleeps.
    <br>Stand up! Now, show us the way she walks!
    <br>This is the way she walks, and whenever you look at her legs, you look at her legs, you are in our kingdom.
    <br>Move like a snake! Let us see how a snake moves.
    <br>Move!
    <br>I am a snake. Oh, please, leave me alone.
    <br>Now, move like a fish! You said you are also a fish!
    <br>Now, stand up! Come here!
    <br>What can you say about your sister?
    <br>Spirit of fornication is too much.
    <br>Do you live with her?
    <br>I stay with her almost all the time.
    <br>What she is saying is true because she has the spirit of anger.
    <br>She is always angry.
    <br>She is always angry?
    <br>She is always angry.
    <br>It is almost like we are younger than her because she wants to be on top.
    <br>You cannot tell her what to do. She will tell you what you will do.
    <br>If you don't want to do it, you will stay away.
    <br>So, anything she says, you people have to obey it in the house?
    <br>Exactly, that's what she wants. That is what she wants us to do all the time.
    <br>If you don't obey her, what will happen?
    <br>She just gets angry. She might end up not talking to you for one week.
    <br>She might be washing dishes and then you come to her and ask her to do something for you.
    <br>She would just look at you. I don't know what she saw though.
    <br>But she would not do it - as if I was younger than her.
    <br>Most of the time when I got back from school, my mother kept complaining
    <br>that when she stands, she keeps her feet up like this - she keeps her feet tipped on the floor.
    <br>My mum keeps asking her to straighten her legs but she doesn't.
    <br>Most of the time, she stands like this.
    <br>When she sleeps, she sleeps like this, with her right hand upward like this.
    <br>My mum would come to knock at my room and say that she keeps her hand upward like this at night.
    <br>Now, you demon, you said that you have destroyed many men.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Through fornication
    <br>Yes!
    <br>How do you destroy them? What will happen to them?
    <br>Any man that sleeps with her, what will happen to the person?
    <br>If he used to succeed, his success would be drained - it would go down.
    <br>You would be seeing us in your dreams, we would come and torment you.
    <br>That is how we work.
    <br>I have destroyed a lot of people - every aspect of the society.
    <br>Whenever they sleep with me, their businesses will go down.
    <br>If you are  expecting anything, it will go down
    <br>and they will be part of our members. That is how we work.
    <br>Now tell us - how many men do you get in a day?
    <br>In a day, four or five.
    <br>How do you get them?
    <br>Whenever she walks in the streets, she gets all the attention.
    <br>I gave her the power.
    <br>The people that she gets, what class of people are they?
    <br>High class people but I want to punish her because she can't have anything close to those people.
    <br>I send her to get them for me, and that's it.
    <br>The caliber of people I am talking about here are big men.
    <br>I don't know the type of business they do.
    <br>I want them to come to my world, then I will give them more wealth,
    <br>if only they obey me.
    <br>Anyone who doesn't want to obey me, they go down.
    <br>Everything that has a beginning must have an end. Your end has come in this body.
    <br>Now you are going.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, out of her! Holy Ghost fire all over your body!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! All over your body!  From your head to your toes!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ! Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out of her, you demon!
    <br>You snake, out!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for this deliverance!
    <br>You are declared free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, sister?
    <br>I'm okay.
    <br>Who are these people to you?
    <br>These are my brothers, and this is my mum.
    <br>Okay, you said that you are a snake and a fish.
    <br>No, I am not a snake, I am not a fish. I am Princess by name.
    <br>Your name is Princess?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You listened to that. It means that the person talking before was an evil spirit
    <br>and Jesus has cast that evil spirit out.
    <br>She is delivered and all those things that she has confessed,
    <br>she is not the one responsible for it; it was the demon.
    <br>Therefore, you should never for a moment use her confession against her
    <br>so that you too will not be tempted.
    <br>She is free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am delivered!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for delivering my family!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Princess Obasi.
    <br>I am originally from Nigeria but I live in South Africa.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations was
    <br>that I was possessed with the spirits of snake and fish.
    <br>The spirit of snake gave me three powers which I used to initiate people into our kingdom.
    <br>They gave me power in my two hands, legs and in my body as well.
    <br>The power I used the most was the power in my legs
    <br>because from my waist downwards was a fish
    <br>and from my waist upwards was like that of a human being.
    <br>They gave me the assignment to go out and bring people into our kingdom
    <br>especially men that are of the high class in the society.
    <br>If I initiated any man and he became a part of our kingdom,
    <br>his finances would go down and he would become a member
    <br>and he would go out and get more souls.
    <br>When I walked on the streets, the thing that caught men's attention were my legs.
    <br>They showed me the way I would walk.
    <br>I also made a covenant with a snake which was the tattoo on my back
    <br>which was shown on the screen.
    <br>You said when you walked on the streets, your legs actually drew attention.
    <br>What was in your legs?
    <br>There were a lot of powers in my legs - the powers of a fish.
    <br>I used it when I walked on the streets to catch the attention of men.
    <br>The only men I went out with were men that drive.
    <br>If I walked on the streets and you looked at my legs, you would be tempted.
    <br>I would stop, we would exchange numbers and meet at a guest house.
    <br>Whenever we had sexual intercourse, you would become part of our kingdom.
    <br>That was how I worked for those marine spirits.
    <br>I had a covenant with them which was the tattoo on my back.
    <br>Before I got this tattoo, I had a dream where I was with them.
    <br>We were playing the way we usually did in the river.
    <br>Whenever I was in the river, you would see part of my body as a fish
    <br>but physically, you wouldn't see it as a fish.
    <br>Only I knew that a part of my body was a fish.
    <br>When we were playing, they told me that they wanted us to have a covenant.
    <br>and that was what I would do to make a covenant with them.
    <br>They showed me the pattern of the tattoo I would get.
    <br>After dreaming, I woke up and I had the urge of getting a tattoo.
    <br>I went to where they do tattoos and they brought out patterns of tattoos.
    <br>I particularly chose the pattern that they had given me.
    <br>I chose the pattern and got the tattoo.
    <br>When I got the tattoo, I became their full member.
    <br>The power I had in the tattoo was that when any man saw my nakedness
    <br>and then saw my tattoo, they would stick to me.
    <br>They wouldn't go out there.
    <br>Married men's homes would be destroyed because of the evil spirit I had.
    <br>What of the beads?
    <br>It was also part of the initiation that I had.
    <br>It was part of my powers. I got the tattoo before the beads.
    <br>I chose the red colour because in my kingdom, red is the colour we like
    <br>and that is my favourite colour in real life.
    <br>Those three powers were the most powerful powers the marine spirits gave me.
    <br>Those were the powers that I normally used to work for them.
    <br>I had gotten a lot of souls in those years.
    <br>They said that at the end of this year, they would make me a queen.
    <br>By the grace of God, I was delivered this year from the marine spirit and the spirit of snake.
    <br>I am no longer in that kingdom and I am no longer going to be the queen
    <br>or whatever they promised to do for me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Did you have an association where people would come together for a meeting
    <br>or did you people purely meet in the spirit?
    <br>Yes, there was a physical association, coming together but it was within the friends I kept.
    <br>We would do everything together but we wouldn't talk about
    <br>what was happening in the spiritual world, when in the physical.
    <br>Within us, we didn't know we were in the same kingdom
    <br>because we had different works they had given us to do physically.
    <br>Did you have particular people you always went for
    <br>or you just wanted to get men to your kingdom?
    <br>I had particular people that I was directed to.
    <br>When I was dreaming, they would show me the type of people
    <br>and how my day would unfold physically.
    <br>They would show me what type of men would approach me
    <br>and what type of men I would be with.
    <br>The type of people that I met in life were high-class business men.
    <br>Those were the type of people we wanted.
    <br>Whenever I initiated them, they would work for us.
    <br>They would receive more wealth.
    <br>If you were stubborn and didn't want to work for us, we would take down your finances.
    <br>That was how we worked and how I was sent.
    <br>That was what the spiritual people would tell me to do.
    <br>Every day, I could sleep with four or five men in total.
    <br>The evil spirit inside me would confuse you.
    <br>We could go to your house or to a guest house
    <br>but mostly, we would go to a guest house.
    <br>Were you interested in a financial gain apart from spiritual attacks?
    <br>You collected money. What was your physical gain apart from the spiritual attacks?
    <br>A part of me was interested in the finances.
    <br>Another part of me had a different work that I had to do
    <br>because that was the spirit they had given me.
    <br>I couldn't just wake up in the morning, sleep with a man and come out empty-handed.
    <br>That was how the evil spirit worked in my life and destroyed my life.
    <br>Personally, it was not your desire to go after men
    <br>but there was a force that was pushing you to do so.
    <br>Is that what you are trying to say?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Sometimes, I was not controlled by the evil spirit.
    <br>It had times when it would come to me.
    <br>When it came to me, I couldn't control myself.
    <br>When you were going out the way the spirit used you -
    <br>was your mum then aware that you normally went out for men?
    <br>No, she did not know.
    <br>If I wanted to go out, I would do the house chores.
    <br>I would make sure I did everything at home.
    <br>When I went out, I would tell her I am going to my friend.
    <br>She didn't know where I was really going to.
    <br>So, you never did anything for them to suspect?
    <br>There was no time that they suspected you were into that business?
    <br>Yes, there was a time they suspected. Whenever they talked about it, I got angry.
    <br>I had the spirit of stubbornness; I didn't listen to anyone.
    <br>When they started talking about it, I knew that what they said was true
    <br>but I wouldn't listen to that.
    <br>When they started talking about it, I would just walk out.
    <br>What is your advice to the youth?
    <br>Start by telling the youth what they should guard against.
    <br>How did this thing initially come into your life?
    <br>If you were aware that something like this was going to ruin your life,
    <br>initially, you would not have allowed this to happen.
    <br>Could you advise the youth how they can guard against this?
    <br>Was it through a friend you contacted this affliction or what?
    <br>What can they guard against so that they would not fall into this?
    <br>Like I said before - my name is Princess Obasi, and I am 18 years old.
    <br>My advice to the youth and teenagers out there is that they should focus on their education.
    <br>Listen to your parents because if I knew that such things could happen to me,
    <br>I would have never lost concentration in school.
    <br>I didn't have concentration in my studies.
    <br>Not that I couldn't listen in school, I could listen and study,
    <br>but I had the spirit of distraction. I was normally distracted.
    <br>So, my advice to the youth out there is to have faith in God.
    <br>If you are suffering from what I suffered from, you should come out
    <br>and share your testimony to the Lord and the Lord who delivered me
    <br>will also set you free from every evil spirit that has been tormenting you.
    <br>Wow!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Okay, what can you say?
    <br>You were once in the world and at your age you know better
    <br>because in the world today, your age, your class is 90% over there.
    <br>They have taken over the whole world.
    <br>Can you tell us - are you afraid of the future of this world,
    <br>going by what has happened?
    <br>Can you tell us about what is happening in the world.
    <br>Can you also prophesy and tell us about what you think will likely happen
    <br>if we do not pray, concerning the world at large.
    <br>Tell us about what is happening in the world.
    <br>Now that you are out of the system.
    <br>From my aspect of view, I think that this world is full of atrocities, fornication
    <br>and a lot of things that are happening are against the Bible.
    <br>Sometimes, I would also get confused about my own future
    <br>because I had a particular dream of what I wanted to be
    <br>but the evil spirit usually pushed me away from my dreams.
    <br>I think that what happened to me is happening to every other youth and teenager.
    <br>If we don't take time, because of what I have experienced,
    <br>I think the world is going to be like Sodom and Gomorrah.
    <br>I want a person like her to speak to the world and she has said it all.
    <br>She is saying, if we do not pray to change what is on the board now - it is written already -
    <br>with prayer, it can be erased.
    <br>She is saying that if prayer is not offered intensively,
    <br>the world will turn upside down.
    <br>From my own aspect of view, from what I have experienced and seen in the world,
    <br>I think that if we are not prayerful and don't take time,
    <br>this world is going to be like Sodom and Gomorrah.
    <br>When I say Sodom and Gormorrah, I mean the aspect of youth going to Facebook.
    <br>You can see fathers, married men and women on Facebook.
    <br>In every chatroom, you can be initiated into those things.
    <br>That was what I meant when I said Sodom and Gomorrah.
    <br>You can easily be initiated in those chatrooms.
    <br>What I meant when I said Sodom and Gomorrah
    <br>was the aspect of facebooking, internet, pornography and chatting.
    <br>You can see young people, married men and women putting themselves on Facebook and internet.
    <br>Some people are there looking for husband, friendship and dates.
    <br>Internet, Facebook, Eskimi, 2go are initiating people as well.
    <br>They are initiating you and that is what we are experiencing in this world.
    <br>This is what I mean by Sodom and Gomorrah.
    <br>That is misusing of those things.
    <br>One thing we don't know - as God's children are using those things,
    <br>satan's children are also using them.
    <br>As you chat on whatever medium you are chatting on,
    <br>satan's children also use them to chat.
    <br>There is a medium now they can use to capture you.
    <br>You will not know the person that you are talking to.
    <br>At the time you will discover, realise the person you are talking to, you have gone too far.
    <br>A relationship can be too far to disconnect from.
    <br>My advice to the world, as I was tormented by the spirits of snake and fish
    <br>and was delivered from all the marine spirits that had been tormenting my life,
    <br>if God could deliver me, He can also deliver other people with different situations.
