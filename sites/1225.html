    <br>Viewers all over the world, prayer is a work of faith.
    <br>Have faith in God.
    <br>All things are possible; have faith in God.
    <br>Today, many of us pray but perhaps, not prayer of faith.
    <br>Have faith in God; all things are possible.
    <br>This means, only faith counts.
    <br>Faith comes when we allow the Word of God to dominate our heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Faith comes when we allow the Word of God to dominate our heart, our spirit.
    <br>I can sense God touching you right now.
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, I can sense God touching you right now,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>Say to the Lord, touch me, Lord.
    <br>Let all spirits in your life leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Spirit of stagnation, spirit of affliction, spirit of rejection, spirit of failure, spirit of hardship -
    <br>leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>No turning back
    <br>Let all spirits operating in your life leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Spirit of stagnation, spirit of failure, spirit of setback, spirit of barrenness, spirit of affliction -
    <br>leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>I command that affliction to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command that bed of affliction – leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it in your bones, kidneys, liver – wherever in your organs – leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You affliction, sickness, disease, leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>What manner of man is Jesus
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>Leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I cover your business, career, future, family, marriage with the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus’ Name
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>This is habit.
    <br>I want to tell you a little about my habit.
    <br>Habit is a gift from God.
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart.
    <br>As I am talking to you, there is prayer going on.
    <br>As I am looking at you, there is prayer going on.
    <br>Constantly pray – prayer without ceasing
    <br>in hymns, spiritual songs in your heart.
    <br>At the beginning, it may be very difficult
    <br>but as you continue, the Lord comes into the matter, helps to do it for you.
    <br>To show your genuine willingness, you have to start on your own.
    <br>Peter said, “I want to come with You, Lord, on the sea”.
    <br>He said, “Come!”
    <br>Peter was thinking that from the beginning, Jesus would help to carry him spiritually
    <br>but Peter moved on his own.
    <br>As he moved on his own, he found himself drowning – going down the sea.
    <br>When he was about to disappear, only his hand remained up in the sea.
    <br>Jesus realised, "Oh no, that is genuine willingness".
    <br>I will make you fishers of men
    <br>If you follow Me
    <br>To make you a fisher of men,
    <br>you become a deliverer, healer...
    <br>People have problems; you remove their problems, you point them the way, "This is the way".
    <br>If someone is thirsty, you cannot give water, you cannot tell him the way.
    <br>If someone is hungry, you cannot give food, you cannot tell him the way.
    <br>When someone is thirsty, needs water and you give water, he will say, "Ah" -
    <br>"Where are you going? Take this way" - he will follow.
    <br>I will make you fishers of men
    <br>If you follow Me
    <br>This is Jesus for you.
    <br>You are to start, take my habit – constantly pray in your heart.
    <br>When you are doing this, it cannot affect any other thing you are doing.
    <br>You can still talk to your neighbour while you are doing that – constantly pray in your heart.
    <br>That is prayer in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>This is what I do – I meditate day and night on the Word and whatever I do prospers.
    <br>Do that and see what will happen.
    <br>When you are going to work, you wake up in the morning,
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, in the Blood of Jesus..."
    <br>Even that is enough.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, in the Blood of Jesus", in your heart.
    <br>And people would greet you, "How are you?" - "Fine."
    <br>"... in the name of Jesus, in the Blood of Jesus..."
    <br>What do you need the name of Jesus, the Blood of Jesus for?
    <br>For sanctification.
    <br>Our heart is so funny.
    <br>Flesh, spirit - there is so much conflict.
    <br>Your desire and God's desire - conflict.
    <br>There is so much division; "Steal - don't steal. Fight - don't fight. Help - don't help him. For and against" -
    <br>this is our heart.
    <br>To sanctify this heart and make it focused; just one focus, one way.
    <br>One way
    <br>Only one way to Heaven
    <br>I’m so glad
    <br>I’m so glad that Jesus is the Way
    <br>The way, not a way.
    <br>When your heart begins to say, "Go this way, that way" - you know there is trouble.
    <br>The way, not a way.
    <br>I meditate on the Word day and night.
    <br>When I say; “On the Word”,
    <br>I mean, constantly pray in my heart
    <br>in hymns - you have many hymns -
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You, oh Lord Jesus"
    <br>You should be busy with that.
    <br>Melody in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are inviting Him; He will come at a time you are not expecting.
    <br>Once He takes over that heart, He will take control.
    <br>Yet, now, you are wrestling - there is so much conflict between this and that.
    <br>Take care of your heart – that is my habit.
    <br>You may stay with me for one day, you will not see me going to the prayer room to pray.
    <br>You will say, "Does it mean that he doesn't pray? But it is a prophet, I have not seen him today praying.
    <br>I have been seeing him moving around; he didn't even go on his knees to pray."
    <br>Oh, who told you I don't pray?
    <br>24 hours, 24/7 my heart is praying.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, please take care of your heart.
    <br>My habit – habit is a gift from God.
    <br>Pray without ceasing – constantly pray in your heart in hymns, spiritual songs,
    <br>make melodies in your heart to the Lord.
    <br>Everywhere is quiet, but hearts should engage in what?
    <br>In prayer.
