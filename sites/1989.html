  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Nathalie Nkobetchou.
    <br>I come from France.
    <br>I am a project manager in a French bank named Société Générale.
    <br>I come today to testify of the goodness of God in my life.
    <br>I came last year, June 11th to The SCOAN during the revival session.
    <br>At that time I had a broken elbow.
    <br>I got the opportunity to be in the prayer line and to be prayed for by the man of God.
    <br>That day we were in the church and he touched me and prayed for me.
    <br>He started to touch my arm, my elbow - the reason why I came.
    <br>Then, he touched my shoulder and my head and continued touching me, praying for me.
    <br>After that, we removed the arm cast I had.
    <br>At that time I was with my mother.
    <br>Usually, I could not wear heels for a long time
    <br>because I had a surgery in 2011 where I got 2 broken bones again.
    <br>It was the first time on my ankle.
    <br>You can see the scar I still have because I had a surgery.
    <br>That is the scar of where you had the fracture on your ankle.
    <br>They had to do a surgery so I got this scar.
    <br>It was painful.
    <br>But when I came to The SCOAN for the revival session, I didn't come for that
    <br>because for me it was starting to be normal life, so I didn't even pay attention.
    <br>I remember that man of God touched my knees - both of them.
    <br>I was asking for prayer for my elbow.
    <br>He started by the elbow and then touched my knees - both of them.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I had to stop working for 3 weeks
    <br>because I couldn't do anything with my elbow.
    <br>Usually, I work all day at a desk; I have to type on computers.
    <br>I couldn't do that because of my broken elbow.
    <br>They had to stop me.
    <br>I got hit by a car and this is how I got the broken elbow.
    <br>The policeman came and brought me to the emergency in France, where they did an x-ray.
    <br>This the first picture you can see on the board.
    <br>You can see the x-ray of my elbow.
    <br>Here you can see it very clearly.
    <br>This is where my elbow was fractured.
    <br>You can see on the picture the fracture of the elbow,
    <br>and that was an x-ray that she took after she had an accident.
    <br>As you can see there is "G" - in French it means 'gauche' - left.
    <br>On the left, you have the report - the results.
    <br>After doing the x-ray, they do a report to say what your problem is.
    <br>As you can see, it is written that I had fractured the bone named 'epicondyle'.
    <br>It is written here - that is the same word in English.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN, and I went to France right after.
    <br>I went to see a surgeon.
    <br>At first, he looked at me and said, "Oh, I guess your bone was broken long time ago."
    <br>I said, "No, it has been 2 weeks."
    <br>He said, "No, that is not possible. You are not wearing any arm cast and I can see that you can move.
    <br>So, it is not possible. When the bone was broken 2 weeks ago, you wouldn't move like this."
    <br>I said, "Yes."
    <br>I brought my x-ray for him to see the dates on it, because the date is written.
    <br>He was like, "OK, so we have to put the arm cast back,
    <br>the arm cast that was removed at The SCOAN."
    <br>So, I said, "No. We cannot put it back."
    <br>He said, "Yes. Otherwise, you might have some aftermath with your elbow.
    <br>You know, elbow is very sensitive."
    <br>I said, "No. Please do an x-ray first and then we will see."
    <br>So, he asked for an x-ray.
    <br>This is the second x-ray that was done.
    <br>So, that was the x-ray you did after the man of God prayed for you?
    <br>Yes, right after, when I came back.
    <br>As you can see, it is not broken - there is nothing.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ?
    <br>First, the doctor was confused, so he asked an x-ray specialist to read the x-ray.
    <br>I had to wait for 2 days.
    <br>This is the report that came out of it.
    <br>Here, if you zoom in, you can see that is for the left elbow.
    <br>For the results they only put "control" which doesn't mean anything.
    <br>Normally they are supposed to say, "OK, it was a fracture and this is what you have."
    <br>Here, they didn't write anything so I had to call the hospital
    <br>and I said there was nothing written on my report.
    <br>They were like, "OK, we will ask the x-ray specialist to call you back to explain to you."
    <br>He called me back and said, "I don't know what to say about your x-ray.
    <br>I don't see anything. You should have left the previous one, then I could have told you something,
    <br>but I have nothing in hand and I don't see anything on your x-ray."
    <br>So it confirmed that really I was healed.
    <br>Even the doctor was confused by the reason I was coming there.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ?
    <br>You can see all the evidences - the x-ray, the report to show the before and after
    <br>of what the Lord, God Almighty has done in her life.
    <br>Can you now demonstrate that you are now free and you no longer feel any pain after the fracture?
    <br>How do you feel now?
    <br>I feel very good.
    <br>I am really healed.
    <br>At work they were surprised - they thought I lied about the fracture,
    <br>because I came earlier, and they said, "Are you sure you had something?"
    <br>I had to show pictures of myself with the arm cast.
    <br>So, it was hard to believe that you actually had an accident with your elbow?
    <br>They thought that I just went on vacation for a small trip like this.
    <br>Wow. Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I want to advise people to really believe in God.
    <br>God can do everything, even what you stopped hoping for - He can still do it for you,
    <br>at His own time.
    <br>So, we have to praise Him all the time to thank Him for what we are enduring and wait for God's time.
