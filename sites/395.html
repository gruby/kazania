    <br>THE MAIN THING ABOUT CHRISTIANITY: TB Joshua
    <br>Be all God has called you.
    <br>If you want to be all God has called you to be,
    <br>you have got to spend time with Him
    <br>and learn from Him, at His feet.
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not what we do.
    <br>"In Jesus' name" - you spend all your time fasting, praying - fine.
    <br>You preach and teach every day; they send you from one place to another - it is good, fine.
    <br>You pay your tithes - fine.
    <br>You sleep in the church - fine.
    <br>All this - fine.
    <br>It is not what we do but the relationship we maintain
    <br>and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.
    <br>If you say you have a relationship with God,
    <br>that relationship must definitely produce an atmosphere.
    <br>What we do for God is only a reflection of the relationship we have with Him.
    <br>Satan hates an independent mind, the mind that would think for itself.
    <br>Satan hates an independent mind,
    <br>the mind that is determined to find out from God the truth.
    <br>What are you saying?
    <br>He is a good listener; he will listen to you but he will still find out from God before taking action.
    <br>Satan would want you to take all you hear without question.
    <br>Don't be afraid to say, "I don't know" if you don't know.
    <br>If you know, say, "I know".
    <br>That is the mind of Christ.
    <br>The presence of God comes by relationship with Him.
    <br>Work on your relationship with Him.
    <br>Stop deceiving yourself, "I'm a pastor, this, that" and wasting of your time, sleeping in the church;
    <br>it is wasting of effort, let us work on our relationship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Work on your relationship".
    <br>And stop deceiving yourself, "I'm a Christian, pastor, prophet, bishop, evangelist,
    <br>counselor, deacon, deaconess".
    <br>Go and work on your relationship with Him.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Because all these titles cannot take us to Heaven.
    <br>"I'm a prophet"; on the last day God will not say, "T.B. Joshua, he is a prophet - allow him to enter".
    <br>Which kind of prophet?
    <br>It is relationship with Him that will take you to Heaven.
    <br>All these, "I'm a pastor, prophet, deacon, deaconess, Christian, this, that" are symbolic.
    <br>Jesus - the hope of glory.
    <br>Work on your relationship.
    <br>The atmosphere produced by that relationship will usher you to Jesus.
    <br>Be all God has called you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
