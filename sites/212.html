  <p>    
    <br>In the arena of liberty, the wise men are being used as battle axes in the hands of God,
    <br>cutting down demonic chains that have held the people in bondage,
    <br>setting them free at the mention of Jesus' name.
    <br>Jesus is the sinners only Saviour.
    <br>What you are watching is the reality that Jesus lives and never said "goodbye".
    <br>Watch as Wise Man Daniel moves along this row, and the reaction of this young man,
    <br>as he encounters the Wise Man.
    <br>He doesn't want to look at the Wise Man's face, and has become suddenly uncomfortable,
    <br>as the Holy Spirit is at work exposing the darkness in his life.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Why are you touching the veil?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Don’t touch the veil.
    <br>Fire! Come out and speak out you demon!
    <br>Speak out, who are you!?
    <br>I said I am Morpheus!
    <br>And who else apart from Morpheus?
    <br>Leo!
    <br>Leave him!
    <br>Can you open your eyes? Do you know where you are?
    <br>Open your eyes! Say now where you are! Open your eyes!
    <br>Stand up and talk, you demon.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>You want this boy to destroy the world?
    <br>No – not what our master has so far acquired.
    <br>You said you were Morpheus?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Who is the next person?
    <br>Leo. I am a big cat.
    <br>You are a big cat?
    <br>The lion.
    <br>A lion.
    <br>Who else again?
    <br>I said Adder.
    <br>Adder?
    <br>It is a relative of a viper.
    <br>A relative of the viper?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We are three beings in him because this guy is too strong,
    <br>too powerful and too supreme in the spirit realm.
    <br>You might be seeing him as a little, small, simple and humble boy
    <br>but in the spirit realm, when he opens his mouth to praise God or pray,
    <br>our kingdoms are threatened heavily.
    <br>Every secret in this world is revealed.
    <br>That is why we came in him to silence his destiny
    <br>but all the prayers of his beloved mother keep on saving him all the time. You see?
    <br>I don’t know what is making me say this but I am under an influence I cannot fathom.
    <br>It is making me confess; I will say it.
    <br>Before...
    <br>Our master will kill me but I cannot control myself.
    <br>Who is the master that sent you?
    <br>Please don’t make me say his name.
    <br>Speak out! Come on - speak out!
    <br>It’s Baphomet. He is a pagan god for whom the Righteous One closed all sacrifice
    <br>and worship that was supposed to be made in the open.
    <br>The Righteous One came to this world and destroyed it
    <br>and now our master only receives his praises and sacrifice through this world's music.
    <br>I am telling you. This boy is a very good singer.
    <br>You say he is what?
    <br>He is multi-talented.
    <br>He is good in arts, science; he is good in anything.
    <br>Music, basketball, you name it.
    <br>Our master saw that his soul was only answering to the Righteous One.
    <br>His soul yearns for the Righteous One.
    <br>My master is the one that people in the music industry of this world worship.
    <br>OK. You said that all the "openings" through which he receives sacrifices
    <br>were blocked by the Righteous One.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And that they devised another means...
    <br>Through music!
    <br>Does it mean your demonic kingdom rules through worldly music?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>You may know us with different names.
    <br>Like what?
    <br>Above all we have the satan’s church, we have the Illuminati,
    <br>we have the AMORC Rosicrucian Order and the Ku Klux Klan.
    <br>And you say you people operate through the music?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Can you explain how you operate through the music?
    <br>We do our signs like this.
    <br>Take it easy. What is the first one? The first sign...
    <br>Come on! Show the first sign. What is the first sign?
    <br>The first one.
    <br>Is it how you show the first sign?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>What does it represent?
    <br>It is a way of rendering glory, power, adoration and above all, loyalty,
    <br>to the master, meaning, “I have only one master”.
    <br>Of which kingdom - kingdom of light or darkness?
    <br>When I mention the pagan gods, we rule the celestial, atmosphere, land
    <br>and the seas, more especially darkness.
    <br>Darkness?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When they were about to give birth to this soul, we killed four of his initial siblings ahead of him.
    <br>His mother was known to be barren.
    <br>He came and my master sent us to kill him.
    <br>On that day, that very night in the hospital, somewhere in Imo State...
    <br>oh no, not Imo State, but somewhere in the Ibo land. It is what we call "Arondisog".
    <br>Yes, I remember vividly well.
    <br>We came that night to take him out of the womb and the Righteous One intervened.
    <br>He cut us off. We were paralysed; we couldn’t kill him.
    <br>He was born and our master vowed that we – Leo, Morpheus and Adder -
    <br>must make sure that this soul dies before he is eight years old.
    <br>We tried all means but he survived because of the fervent prayers of his mother.
    <br>We tried other ways to kill him; we caused accidents and catastrophes, you name it.
    <br>We tried but his mother’s prayers and the heartbeat of this soul, his heart...
    <br>Just like you say in the Bible, “David is a man after God’s heart”. That is true.
    <br>You said what?
    <br>I said, I did not stutter...
    <br>I said just like in the Bible - "David is a man after God's heart".
    <br>This soul is also a man after God’s heart.
    <br>He doesn’t love vanity; he doesn’t love material things.
    <br>He only has love for humans, even for those he doesn’t know.
    <br>As long as he knows that person is in need, he is willing to help.
    <br>He is willing to share anything he has.
    <br>OK, can you tell us how you rule the world through worldly music? How?
    <br>I said, when we sing, we twist the mind and the soul of the human body
    <br>to have 100% lust for vanity, music, sex and anything that is sinful.
    <br>Such soul can never – as we are doing to this soul – read the Word of God.
    <br>They can never pray fervently or visit the house of God steadily.
    <br>You will always...
    <br>Please!
    <br>You want to do what?
    <br>The soul will always look for beer parlours, clubs, prostitution houses, you name it.
    <br>Anything that involves sin but does not involve the Righteous One.
    <br>Through this music you lure human souls into the things that involve sins.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Does it mean that you possess these worldly songs?
    <br>Before these worldly songs are released, our worshippers render our own prayers.
    <br>When they offer the prayer - is it physically or spiritually?
    <br>It is always in the secret chamber, undisclosed to man.
    <br>Undisclosed to man?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Where is that secret chamber located?
    <br>They are around everywhere in this world.
    <br>Everywhere?
    <br>We are everywhere.
    <br>We own this world but the Righteous One wants to take it from our master.
    <br>The Righteous One wants to take this evil kingdom from your master?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You said anytime a music is released, you people offer prayer in your secret chamber.
    <br>Can you answer me!
    <br>You say what?
    <br>You pray?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When you offer a prayer, what does that prayer do to the music, before it is released?
    <br>It’s not just ordinary prayers. It’s like an incantation.
    <br>Like an incantation?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Do you know that language?
    <br>I cannot disclose such language.
    <br>Answer - do you know the language?
    <br>It is not for us to say; it is for the worshippers to say.
    <br>It is worshippers that say it?
    <br>The language is just like a programme. It programmes us; it gives us license.
    <br>To do what?
    <br>To manifest into the human.
    <br>Let's say that somebody is listening to some of the music you have possessed;
    <br>what would happen to that person as he is listening to the song?
    <br>What would you do?
    <br>For instance, by merely listening to the music, we don’t have full license into you
    <br>until you use a catalyst that will speed up the reaction.
    <br>What is the catalyst that speeds up the reaction?
    <br>You can talk about drinks, morphine, heroin, cocaine or marijuana -
    <br>anything that will open the mind and make the gateway to the mind free,
    <br>that will send the Spirit of God away from the gateway of the mind.
    <br>Before that, we tried so many ways to initiate this soul.
    <br>As of 2009/2010 after his service as a copper,
    <br>he came in contact with our full member who was tattooed on his body.
    <br>There were tattoos?
    <br>Our member who was tattooed from the shoulder region to the stomach.
    <br>He saw our symbol which is the eye you see on a dollar bill,
    <br>just like in the pyramids in the days of old.
    <br>When he met with your full member what happened to him?
    <br>He was supposed to be the right-hand man to welcome Damien into this world.
    <br>Who is Damien?
    <br>Damien is popularly known in this world. His mark is 666.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How many people have you possessed through music in this world?
    <br>They are billions, zillions, an uncountable amount.
    <br>Uncountable?
    <br>Uncountable.
    <br>What is happening to their lifestyles now?
    <br>When they go to church, they hear God’s Word
    <br>and we are being forced to run outside and wait for them.
    <br>When they come out, because of their habit which is the catalyst, we come back.
    <br>What do you do to their lives when you come back?
    <br>We make it even worse than before; we tarnish everything.
    <br>You said that those who listen to your worldly music which you possess,
    <br>they don't have the time for God.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>How do you distinguish those people from real children of God?
    <br>It’s simple. We know by the catalyst they take. Alcohol is also a catalyst.
    <br>What is the difference between those people and the children of God?
    <br>Those people are like vessels for us; vessels that we possess.
    <br>Those who take this catalyst?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They are vessels.
    <br>Can you people possess the children of God through this worldly music? Is it possible?
    <br>No, because they don’t use the catalysts.
    <br>The catalyst facilitates your going inside?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is only those who use...
    <br>It is our license.
    <br>It is your license?
    <br>Yes - to enter.
    <br>To enter?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How did you enter this body? There must be a means. Is it through a catalyst?
    <br>How did you possess this body?
    <br>He was introduced to that catalyst when he was in school.
    <br>His first cousin who is a cultist tried to initiate him.
    <br>He didn’t but he succeeded in giving him the catalyst.
    <br>This very soul, being the only one in that zone and far away from the Righteous One,
    <br>took that catalyst as his daily bread. He cannot eat, sleep or rest without having it.
    <br>That is how we came into possession of him.
    <br>Before, we could only cause havoc and harm his way.
    <br>We stripped him off of his work in oil companies that he was supposed to have.
    <br>We stripped him of his talents as a computer engineer.
    <br>We made him...
    <br>OK, listen. Can you mention the talents this boy has that made you want to destroy him?
    <br>What are the talents? Mention them one by one. The first one?
    <br>He’s good at music; he’s good in praises.
    <br>He started worshipping God from the children’s choir, to the teenage choir, to the adult choir,
    <br>until when he got into university and the catalyst was introduced.
    <br>OK.
    <br>We made him...
    <br>Listen. From the primary school to the secondary school level he was closer to God?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But when they introduced the catalyst to him - you entered.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you manipulated him
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you show us the second sign you were trying to demonstrate?
    <br>Second sign!
    <br>What does it imply?
    <br>It implies Damien’s mark.
    <br>Does it mean that some humans beings possess these signs and marks you are talking about?
    <br>No. They don’t just possess the sign. They feel it is just like a freestyle sign,
    <br>like you do in music but it simply says, “Damien, I am your vessel to possess.
    <br>I am your soul to claim”.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Once again. You said you people were three dwelling in this body.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The first person?
    <br>His name is Morpheus.
    <br>Second person?
    <br>Which is Leo!
    <br>The third person?
    <br>Adder!
    <br>Morpheus, Leo, and Adder; you say you operate like a lion, cat...
    <br>... and the god of dreams.
    <br>And the...?
    <br>The god of dreams!
    <br>What do you mean by the god of dreams?
    <br>The god of dreams is the one who puts the human mind in a trance, whether drugged, high or normal.
    <br>OK, right now; you Morpheus, you Leo, you Adder, that manifest in a form of a lion, cat,
    <br>or wicked god of dreams - it is time to leave this body.
    <br>Jesus wants you out right now.
    <br>Please, we are begging you. Please, do not remove...
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Hey - you are going.
    <br>This one will destroy our works.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Inside your head.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. You are free. Rise up!
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>This light is too bright.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Good day, sir.
    <br>Good day.
    <br>Do you remember what happened to you?
    <br>Why am I sweating?
    <br>Are you sweating?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What made you to be sweating?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>How did I get here?
    <br>How did you...
    <br>How did I get here?
    <br>I was about to ask you because I am surprised that you are here. How come you are here?
    <br>I don’t know these people.
    <br>You don't know which people?
    <br>Who brought me here?
    <br>It must be a bad dream. What happened?
    <br>How did I get here?
    <br>I was supposed to ask you. I'm asking you too. I'm surprised to see you here.
    <br>I can’t remember anything.
    <br>Come.
    <br>It all calls for joy. OK?
    <br>OK.
    <br>But you just said something now. Do you remember what you said?
    <br>I said, "How did I get here?"
    <br>Is that all you said?
    <br>You didn't say anything else?
    <br>I remember the last one. I asked if this was a bad dream or something.
    <br>OK. Maybe I should remind you what you said?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You said you were Morpheus...
    <br>Me?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Sorry, you mistook me for someone else.
    <br>My name is Ochia Innocent Oluchi Chidozie.
    <br>OK. It's a pleasure to meet you.
    <br>OK, it’s a pleasure, sir.
    <br>You said you were Adder.
    <br>Adder?
    <br>I do not understand.
    <br>I don’t know who is Adder, please.
    <br>You said you were Leo.
    <br>Leo?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>No. How can I be Leo?
    <br>You said you manifest as a lion.
    <br>As a lion?
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>Sir, if you look at me physically, I am a human being.
    <br>I don’t have claws, teeth, or fangs like a lion.
    <br>Not only that. You said that you manifest as a big cat.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>Big cat, sir – maybe you are mistaking me for someone else.
    <br>And also like a viper.
    <br>No, sir. It’s not me.
    <br>It is a clear proof that that demon that tormented your career and life is out.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>Praise be to God.
    <br>Oh, this is a house of...
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>I never knew I was in the House of God.
    <br>You never knew you were in the House of God? You discovered it now?
    <br>Yes. I thought it was a theatre, maybe showbiz…
    <br>No. This is a House of God.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! 
    <br>I am free!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Citizens of Heaven - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ochia Innocent Oluchi Chidozie. I am from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I come from a family of four; I am the firstborn.
    <br>I was a member of the church and in the children's choir
    <br>from when I was a child and then I was in the teenage choir.
    <br>I gained admission into university, where I then met my cousin who was an occultist.
    <br>He initiated me into the acts of drugs, smoking, drinking, and everything.
    <br>After I was initiated, I stopped everything that had to do with music -
    <br>the choir, the church – I stayed away from the church.
    <br>I loved the new me that I was introduced to.
    <br>OK. You said that you were introduced to drugs.
    <br>Can you tell us the drugs that you were introduced to
    <br>and how much of these drugs you were taking.
    <br>I was introduced to marijuana, morphine, and other types of drugs.
    <br>How much of these were you taking on a daily basis?
    <br>On a daily basis, I could pop three pills of a drug and mix it with another.
    <br>I would also smoke a bag of marijuana, in order to feel stronger and high.
    <br>In the process of taking these drugs, I discovered that I hated the world; I was anti-social.
    <br>If people would come around me, I would block my ears with earpieces and listen to worldly music.
    <br>I would not pay attention to what people were saying.
    <br>Before this time you were growing up in the church, you were in the choir, you were a Christian.
    <br>As you were growing up, it was these drugs you were introduced to,
    <br>that actually took you away from God.
    <br>Yes. Those drugs blotted out everything that had to do with God within me.
    <br>It was as if they erased it from my memory and from my body.
    <br>I got joy out of taking drugs.
    <br>It was as if it was a tribute I had to do for something that was inside of me -
    <br>to manifest and possess me.
    <br>I didn't know.
    <br>Yes, I started listening to all kinds of worldly music.
    <br>I never had...
    <br>If you played any Christian music around me, I would simply walk out and not want to be around it.
    <br>I wouldn’t download Christian music on my phone – only worldly music.
    <br>As I was introduced to drugs and was taking them every day,
    <br>I noticed that I had several encounters but I never knew what it was.
    <br>I took it as if it was a part of my day-to-day activities.
    <br>I went for service and I came back to reimburse myself.
    <br>I needed to get more money in order to complete my service.
    <br>I served in Niger State and I didn’t see any means of getting money there,
    <br>so I went back to my parents to get more money.
    <br>When I got home, they told me that they couldn’t give me the money immediately.
    <br>They said that I was looking thin – as though I hadn’t eaten.
    <br>They said that I should stay home and eat well, before going back.
    <br>I would still sneak out and continue my bad habits – smoking and drinking.
    <br>Then it occurred to me...
    <br>I went to a special bar where people would drink and at the back, they’d smoke.
    <br>I went there, isolated myself from the crowd and was smoking as usual.
    <br>I played my music loud.
    <br>Three beings then manifested.
    <br>They were three people that I did not know.
    <br>I hadn’t seen them before.
    <br>I was just surprised.
    <br>They came exactly to where I was and sat down in a circle.
    <br>One was directly facing me – he was dark in complexion.
    <br>The other two were at my side.
    <br>I didn’t converse with them because I had joy in what I was doing.
    <br>I had love for what I was doing.
    <br>I was saying in my head that any song I hear, I could make it and say it exactly,
    <br>I wished I could be a popular musician.
    <br>I wanted to be like that.
    <br>The one directly facing me uttered that he could hear my thoughts,
    <br>that he could hear everything I said.
    <br>I was stunned. I pointed to myself and asked, “Are you referring to me?”
    <br>In my mind, that was what I said because I wanted to be sure that he was talking to me.
    <br>He said, “Yes” and pointed towards me, “I was talking to you”.
    <br>I didn’t want to speak in English or orally.
    <br>I wanted to be sure that he wasn’t using any gimmicks or is a second-class magician.
    <br>I asked, “What was I saying?”
    <br>He said, “You said, ‘I want to be famous, like a rap star’.”
    <br>He said, “It comes at a price”.
    <br>I said in my head, “What is this price?
    <br>If it involves bloodshed, I am not going to partake in it”.
    <br>He said that it didn’t involve bloodshed but there was an initiation, a ritual I had to do.
    <br>I told him to show me the ritual, that I would do it.
    <br>I never spoke aloud to them; they were reading my every thought.
    <br>It was as if the gateway of my mind was open for them to see what was going on inside there.
    <br>They read my every thought.
    <br>He told me that in order for me to continue the procedure, I had to follow some instructions.
    <br>I said he should tell me the instructions.
    <br>He then removed his clothes.
    <br>I was baffled. I was scared, instantly because of what I saw.
    <br>I had never seen such a tattoo before, on any human being.
    <br>He was tattooed from the neck down to his stomach.
    <br>There was a pyramid with an eye inside it.
    <br>It was the same tattoo all around; there was no other tattoo.
    <br>The same tattoo was repeated all over his body.
    <br>He stopped speaking to me orally and started speaking through his mind.
    <br>He said I should follow the procedure - that I should look at the tattoo and lust after it,
    <br>as if I was being seduced by a lady.
    <br>He said that was the procedure.
    <br>I said, “OK”.
    <br>He stretched forth his arm and I started lusting after the tattoo on his arm.
    <br>When it got to his neck, I noticed that he started moaning as if someone was making love to him.
    <br>I asked, “What am I doing? This is a man. I’m not gay. Why should I lust after a man?"
    <br>I stood up and left the circle.
    <br>He shouted orally to me, “You are going to die in four days!”
    <br>I didn’t complete the initiation.
    <br>When I went home, in my dreams, before those four days elapsed,
    <br>I kept seeing a being manifesting with a face of somebody I knew.
    <br>He told me, “You are a mut. When we call you, you run.
    <br>When we want you to do something, you run away.
    <br>You don’t want to finish it”.
    <br>He said that they were not happy with me
    <br>and that I’d never be successful until I finished the initiation.
    <br>He said that I’d never be the rap star I wanted to be until I finished that initiation.
    <br>I took it as a mere dream; I didn’t take it seriously.
    <br>After the four days elapsed, I went back to a different spot and was smoking and drinking as usual.
    <br>When I was listening to the worldly music, the voices became clearer.
    <br>I was able to decipher song lyrics, as if they were sent straight to me.
    <br>They would tell me what to do, how to dress and how to manipulate.
    <br>They put me in a trance.
    <br>When I entered that trance, I saw myself walking normally along a footpath;
    <br>I didn’t know that I was walking in the middle of a highway.
    <br>The cars were too scared to hit me – I didn’t know what caused that.
    <br>People who were near to me were screaming, “What is wrong with you? You are on the highway!"
    <br>I didn’t answer them.
    <br>My life became stagnant.
    <br>I wasn’t going forwards or backwards, I just stayed where I was.
    <br>If I submitted my CV, there would be no phone call for a job.
    <br>Anything I did, there was no way.
    <br>When I tried to go for projects, to study external courses in computer,
    <br>I ended up having white elephant projects – I ended up running away.
    <br>I ended up being in rehab and everything about me was messed up.
    <br>Immediately after that encounter, any time you listened to this worldly music
    <br>you would be hearing a voice
    <br>that would be telling you exactly what to do, how to dress, how to behave.
    <br>Can you just give us an example of what that voice was telling you to do?
    <br>The voice told me the first day I started hearing it, that I was an ace in the hood,
    <br>that nobody could manipulate me
    <br>and that if I doubted it, I should do the instructions and see what would happen.
    <br>He told me that there were baggy jeans that my uncle sent me from Germany,
    <br>which is one of a kind and not available anywhere, that I should press the logo of an ace on them
    <br>and that I should walk around dressed like a gangster in any neighbourhood
    <br>and that I would see what would happen.
    <br>I obeyed the voice. I went and did exactly as instructed.
    <br>I customized the jeans and dressed up like that.
    <br>I walked into dangerous neighbourhoods, even in the North, where people were armed with guns.
    <br>I was like a fearless lion.
    <br>When I entered, they all gave way.
    <br>Even people who were asking who I was wanted to know me,
    <br>they would want to stop me but I knew what to say to them and they would just give way.
    <br>They wouldn’t stop me; I’d have my way.
    <br>If I needed something and had no money, I would open my mouth and say, "This is what I want"
    <br>and they would give it to me.
    <br>When I was in that hood, when I sang under the influence of that evil spirit,
    <br>everybody would go into a trance.
    <br>Some of them who could not stand the trance would run away,
    <br>while some would end up sleeping as if they were lifeless.
    <br>They would not know themselves.
    <br>I did whatever I wanted to do and walked away.
    <br>The life I was living under the influence of that voice was a terrible life - a very dangerous one.
    <br>Anyone who was a Christian could sense that there was a force on me
    <br>because I would look at you as if I wanted to devour you, as if you were a prey.
    <br>It was as if I was ready to jump on you and kill you.
    <br>I didn’t like official things like suits or anything corporate.
    <br>I didn’t have any of them.
    <br>I didn’t have any zeal for them.
    <br>I loved anything that had to do with gangsters, different ugly signs, skulls
    <br>and all kinds of things that portrayed the evil realm.
    <br>I loved it so much.
    <br>I would feel this ego in me that would grow and made me walk as if I was a demi-god in society.
    <br>Nobody would mess with me. Everybody was scared of me. Everybody is afraid of me.
    <br>Even those who were strong enough to test me,
    <br>I would know what to say to them and they would just walk away.
    <br>I went to rehab on two occasions.
    <br>On the first occasion, I went for three months.
    <br>When I came out, I thought it was all over.
    <br>The voice came back and told me not to worry, that I was taking much before
    <br>that this time, I should take a little.
    <br>That if I took a little, it would be OK, that I would not be taken back there.
    <br>I obeyed the voice and when I started to obey the voice, the same spirit came back and possessed me.
    <br>This time around, I caused a catastrophe at home:
    <br>I scattered my room, punctured my ceiling, scattered my dad’s car and never said, "Sorry".
    <br>I was even feeling proud that what I was doing was right.
    <br>Then I was sent back to rehab for another six months.
    <br>So, altogether, it was nine months I spent in rehab.
    <br>When I came out of rehab, I thought it was all over.
    <br>I never knew that the stigma was still there and that evil spirit that was talking to me.
    <br>I was hearing this voice clearly.
    <br>It was telling me, “See, you are not moving forward, there is no work; you are only at home.
    <br>Why are you sitting down at home? Go and smoke and forget your problems
    <br>and you will see, everything will be fine".
    <br>I went back to it and started to see the manifestations again.
    <br>I enjoyed it and reasoned that it was better to manifest than to be idle.
    <br>When I was taking those drugs, I had a hundred percent hatred for the Word of God.
    <br>I could not open the Bible for five minutes.
    <br>If I opened it, it was as if I was looking through pages; nothing would enter.
    <br>I could not pray at all. My prayer life was really low.
    <br>I never fasted, paid tithes or offering. I hated everything about that.
    <br>I was absent...
    <br>Even on the Sabbath day, the day which is holy for God, I never attended church.
    <br>I preferred staying at home, washing my clothes and doing other things.
    <br>That was the day I set out to wash my clothes.
    <br>I didn’t wash clothes on any other day except on the Sabbath day.
    <br>How did you come to be in The Synagogue Church Of All Nations?
    <br>I was informed by my parents that their older sister was delivered at The SCOAN.
    <br>We didn’t have this station at home, we watched DSTV.
    <br>I didn’t know about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>They told me that my auntie was delivered but they couldn’t go, so I should go to represent them.
    <br>I said OK since it was just one day. I could go and come back.
    <br>I rushed down with a few things and came down.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, it was a Saturday deliverance service.
    <br>I was feeling very uncomfortable.
    <br>I was wondering where I could go and smoke.
    <br>I had never watched Emmanuel TV. I never knew what was happening here.
    <br>I just thought it was going to be like a normal day church service.
    <br>When the Wise Man prayed for me, it was as if fire was burning me.
    <br>It was so hot, I couldn’t stand because everything about me was inflamed.
    <br>I couldn’t fathom the force.
    <br>The force was so strong; it compelled me to say everything.
    <br>I went blank. It was as if something in me came up.
    <br>I started manifesting. I didn’t know what was happening
    <br>but I noticed that I was blank and I felt something was burning me.
    <br>From my head to my toes, I was on fire.
    <br>That was what if felt like.
    <br>All glory be to God Almighty, ever since I was delivered,
    <br>I have been able to sleep well like a baby, without taking drugs.
    <br>I have been able to eat well.
    <br>Even the pain I had in this knee for almost four years - I didn't know what caused the pain -
    <br>went instantly when the Wise Man touched my leg.
    <br>I no longer feel the pain.
    <br>I can now kick my leg and stretch it to any limit and I don’t feel any pain.
    <br>I said “wow”- this is really the touch of God on my life.
    <br>The craving that I had disappeared.
    <br>The voice I heard, I no longer hear it.
    <br>Rather, I hear a good and gentle voice telling me what to do, say and how to act.
    <br>You mean to say, brother, that since your deliverance,
    <br>you have not gone anywhere near drugs, cigarettes, or alcohol.
    <br>Yes, since my deliverance I have never dreamt of or had any urge for drugs or alcohol,
    <br>I have not even thought about it.
    <br>The thought of it doesn’t come to me at all.
    <br>It is as if the Holy Spirit sealed the gate so that anything not of God cannot come in.
    <br>I was so delighted. I kept on praying for that gate to continue to be sealed from now on till I die.
    <br>When I open the Bible, it is as if the Bible is talking to me,
    <br>it’s giving me guidelines on how to move, giving me steps to take.
    <br>I make sure that I have a notebook with me because every second
    <br>Words of God keep coming through the Prophet.
    <br>I hear words that inspire me that tell me how to fortify myself
    <br>to reach out to the youth out there and tell them how to avoid those devices
    <br>and to tell them how to protect themselves from those devices.
    <br>That is what the Word of God has been doing to me.
    <br>Viewers all around the world, I have this message for you.
    <br>We are Christians, meaning Christ-like.
    <br>Jesus Christ came; He was humble and loyal to His Father.
    <br>He did not partake in things that concern the flesh.
    <br>So, if you want to make it to Heaven, avoid things that concern the flesh -
    <br>the spirit of lust, alcoholism, seduction, everything, please do not go into it,
    <br>even drugs – these are the food of the enemy, the devil.
    <br>It is not from God; Jesus Christ was not a drug addict.
    <br>He was not a smoker, He was not a drinker, He was not a womaniser.
    <br>Please, avoid those things, for they give the devil access to you. Thank you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.

    <br>sermons and testimonies from The SCOAN.
