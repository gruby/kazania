  <p>    
    <br>My name is Victory Imasuen.
    <br>I am a deportee from Libya; me and my colleague.
    <br>I am from Edo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I'm here to share the experience I had in Libya
    <br>and I want to give testimony about what God has done in my life.
    <br>Before I went to Libya, it was very difficult for me to start up something as a young boy.
    <br>When I lost my father at the age of 11, it was only my mother and I
    <br>who could take care of six children.
    <br>During that time, it was not easy for me and my mother.
    <br>I had to take the step of faith to see if there was anything that I could do to assist my mother.
    <br>So, I did all sorts of jobs and activities to sponsor myself in school.
    <br>After all, I found myself learning how to cut hair.
    <br>Few months later, I became very good at it and I worked as a professional barber.
    <br>One day, I was cutting one of my customers' hair and he advised me saying that
    <br>since I know how to cut very well, if I could go to Europe, I would make it
    <br>and earn a lot of money to take care of my juniors and I would be able to do what I wanted to do.
    <br>I asked him how much it would cost me and he said it was 350,000 Naira.
    <br>I said that I didn't have such a big money and he asked how much I had.
    <br>I said I only had 140,000 Naira which was the money that I had been contributing
    <br>at the end of every month – 10,000 Naira – and that was only I could save out of my salary.
    <br>The man then said that he would help me; if I paid with what I had
    <br>and when I got to Europe, I could pay the remaining money.
    <br>Then I gave him 140,000 Naira.
    <br>We moved from Benin to Kano and from there to Agadez.
    <br>We took a car to the desert.
    <br>On the third day, we were moving in convoy with different passengers
    <br>who were also going to Europe and it was about 30 cars.
    <br>One of the cars had a terrible accident which only two or three passengers were able to survive.
    <br>Then on the fourth day, our water got finished and that was when everything started.
    <br>There was no more water for us to drink and I almost gave up on myself
    <br>but something was telling me that if I gave up on that point, who would take care of my juniors
    <br>who were the reason I started the journey.
    <br>It was as if a force came upon me; I had strength and I was no more thirsty.
    <br>On the sixth day, we arrived in Libya.
    <br>When we got there, the driver said that the trafficker did not pay for our transportation.
    <br>We said that we had already paid our money to him.
    <br>We tried to make a call but to no avail.
    <br>The man said that he was going to sell us into slavery.
    <br>The driver took us to Sabat to sell us into slavery and there were ladies among us.
    <br>We were 11 in number.
    <br>When we got there, we were sold to a Ghanaian man and he took us to his place.
    <br>In his place, there was another underground house in which whenever they beat us
    <br>but even though we shouted, nobody would hear and come to help us.
    <br>When I entered, I met a lot of Nigerians and people from other countries.
    <br>We were locked up in a small room and we were about over 200 people.
    <br>There were also ladies locked up in a room opposite ours.
    <br>The next day, they started beating me saying that I should call my mother to send me money.
    <br>That was the time my mother got to know that I was not in Nigeria because I did not tell her before I left.
    <br>Then she knew that I was not in Nigeria and she asked me where I was.
    <br>I told her that I was in Libya and I explained the situation I was in.
    <br>I told her of the money that they were demanding – 250,000 Naira.
    <br>She said, "I don’t have such a big money. How am I going to get the money?"
    <br>For months, I did not hear from my mother; not even a phone call.
    <br>When there was no call for me, they kept on beating me everyday.
    <br>Even going to the toilet was very difficult at times.
    <br>When I went to use the toilet, it was very painful and discharged blood at that point.
    <br>For the ladies, they would wait three or five days for their money but if the money did not come,
    <br>they would sell the ladies to do prostitution.
    <br>Some women would come to our place to buy the ladies and take them to traffickers
    <br>where they would start prostitution.
    <br>Even though she got to the point where she would be able to pay the money back,
    <br>the traffickers would sell them to another trafficker so that she could start another work.
    <br>I saw such case more than three times.
    <br>On the eighth month, I got freedom back; I paid money and came out of the prison.
    <br>To get to feed myself was very difficult because when I called my mother,
    <br>she said she did not have money for feeding.
    <br>I had to go wherever they sent us to work.
    <br>A lot of ladies became pregnant without knowing the father of the babies
    <br>because they would sleep with men from different countries.
    <br>Due to the prostitution, most of them became pregnant without knowing the father of the child.
    <br>I was working trying to make money to feed myself.
    <br>About two months later, after I came out of the prison, I was able to raise some money
    <br>by working in a barber shop.
    <br>Then, I planned to move to Tripoli to cross the border but before I could get there, I was kidnapped again.
    <br>They said they would deport us back to Nigeria.
    <br>When we got there, they took us to a prison and I met a lot of Nigerians there; more than 10,000.
    <br>The life was very difficult in the prison.
    <br>Even the way we ate – we ate only once in a day; one piece of bread and nothing else.
    <br>Even the water we drank was salt water.
    <br>They decided to deport ladies first and at that point, we asked the ladies
    <br>that whenever they left, they should try to take some men claiming to be their husbands.
    <br>Luckily, one of the ladies took me and claimed that I was her husband.
    <br>That was how I found myself in Tripoli deportee camp before a CNN reporter came.
    <br>I said to myself that I might get some help from this media if I spoke, so I decided to speak
    <br>to CNN and they interviewed me.
    <br>We see on the screens of TVs...
    <br>We have just heard from the brother, who was sharing his experience during his stay in Libya.
    <br>He said that he had left Nigeria as a professional barber.
    <br>After arriving to Libya he went through lot of experiences.
    <br>He ended up in the underground house.
    <br>Many of people there were packed in small cells, which were designed for two persons.
    <br>He was sold to kidnappers who told him that he had to pay the ransom, in order to get his freedom.
    <br>He said it had been by chance that somebody was able to rescue him out, paying the kidnappers the ransom.
    <br>After leaving this place he ended up in a prison.
    <br>From the prison he was sent to the deportation camp.
    <br>While his stay in the deportation camp, the CNN came to make a report on deportees there.
    <br>We just want to ask our brothers...
    <br>On the screen of TV we see our brother.
    <br>Can you just explain what were you doing there?
    <br>On the programme of the TV, I am the one who was talking.
    <br>When CNN came, I decided to speak because I really needed help.
    <br>At the end, nothing came out of it and finally, I was deported to Nigeria
    <br>through IOM (International Organisation for Migration) who assists deportees from Libya.
    <br>I decided to come to The SCOAN
    <br>because even before I left, I heard that The SCOAN renders help to others and also deportees like me.
    <br>I decided to come here to seek prayers because I thought it was because of the curse
    <br>which made it really hard on me and I prayed every curse and poverty in my family would break.
    <br>I would share my testimony of how God brought me back alive.
    <br>I really want to say, "Thank You, Lord" for everything He has done for me.
    <br>We just heard from the brother -
    <br>after he was taken to the deportation camp, the CNN came to interview them about their experiences
    <br>of their journey through Libya.
    <br>He was able to share his experience.
    <br>He was deported back to Nigeria - he was taken to his State
    <br>but he decided to come to Lagos, to The SCOAN, because he knew God would surely use T.B. Joshua
    <br>and Emmanuel TV partners to rescue him out of this terrible conditions,
    <br>that he had found himself in, during his journey by illegal means in Libya.
    <br>That is why he is here today to seek help from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>so that he can start his life anew.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>I'm Osazee Aghimiee.
    <br>I'm from Edo State.
    <br>I was a driver before I left Nigeria.
    <br>I have married and have one baby boy who was born just three days before I left Nigeria.
    <br>Suddenly, most of my friends called me and told me that I should come to Europe.
    <br>I agreed with them and told them that I would gather money.
    <br>As a driver, I would follow my friends to Lagos, Abuja or Port Harcourt, any time I didn't have work.
    <br>From there, I gathered a little money.
    <br>One day, I told my wife that I wanted to travel to Libya
    <br>and she said that I should manage with little work I had.
    <br>When the day came, I woke up and she was wearing a baby belt holding our baby.
    <br>I left the house with my passport and everything I needed.
    <br>I paid 200,000 Naira to the trafficker who said he would take me to Libya.
    <br>That day, I ran away to his house and on the third day, we left for Libya.
    <br>When we got to Agadez, they put us inside 24 vehicles.
    <br>They arranged us into 24 cars.
    <br>There were 34 people in each vehicle.
    <br>We left for Sahara desert.
    <br>After two days, close to Duruku, one of the cars had an accident.
    <br>We came down to help them and buried four people who died.
    <br>The car was going fast.
    <br>Our driver said that we would not bury them because he was in hurry.
    <br>Where actually was your destination?
    <br>My destination was Europe.
    <br>When I arrived in Saba, I called my wife that I was already in Libya.
    <br>I asked her to help me to send money for my account so that I could use it to cross the border.
    <br>But, she refused because she just gave birth to my baby so she needed to take care of him.
    <br>I said that there was no problem because I would be working.
    <br>I saved 1,500 Dinars and they took me to the seaside.
    <br>When we got to the seaside, they put us in lapalapa (balloon boat).
    <br>The same night, they pushed us.
    <br>From Tunis to Malta then to International sea where there was a boundary.
    <br>Getting to international sea, we saw a very big ship surrounded by almost 25 balloon boats.
    <br>Before we knew it, we saw foreign ladies coming and they told us that
    <br>they were international rescuers and they came to rescue us.
    <br>They welcomed and addressed us that we should wait
    <br>then they would come back in 20 minutes to rescue us.
    <br>There were also other boats to the ship and they couldn't attend to all of us
    <br>so we should wait and we were waiting for them.
    <br>Within a short time, the Libyan terrorists called 'Asma boys' drove speed boats to the big ship.
    <br>They started entering balloon boats; one of them entered my boat and others to other boats.
    <br>They drove our balloon boats away and said they were taking us back to Libya.
    <br>As they drove our boats, everybody was shouting for help.
    <br>The three ladies came and begged them to leave us because we were already on international sea.
    <br>They refused and started using guns to hit people inside the boats.
    <br>They drove us to Janzur and Tripoli.
    <br>As we were going, the Asma boys poured the fuel we kept for our journey inside the boat.
    <br>There was already water in the balloon boat.
    <br>They poured the fuel inside the balloon boat.
    <br>The sea water is with salt - you cannot mix this water with fuel.
    <br>After they poured the fuel inside the boat, they told us to lie down and we did.
    <br>Then the fuel started burning us; if you see my leg, you can see the scar.
    <br>The second time, after I was freed from them, the man who was holding the camp came
    <br>and said that the second chance had come and they wanted to try to push us again.
    <br>We said as long as we decided to go to Europe, there was no problem.
    <br>At night, we took out the balloon boats that we kept in the camp
    <br>and they took us to the seaside; we were 160 people.
    <br>They took us to the seaside and pumped and fixed the boats.
    <br>When we drove about five hours on the Mediterranean sea, we saw a fisherman
    <br>and he said we should go back because the wave would become stronger within an hour
    <br>and we still had to travel more than three hours.
    <br>We told our captain to turn the boat but he said we couldn’t lose the second chance.
    <br>As we continued, people were shouting; because the fisherman warned us to go back,
    <br>they were shouting and started leaving the boat so, we told the captain to turn the boat.
    <br>Before we realised, the weather changed and started rocking the boats.
    <br>A lot of people died; we were 160 in number.
    <br>I can remember that it was about 20 people survived.
    <br>Two girls from my village died.
    <br>Almost 100 people had died during that journey.
    <br>I was praying to God to take me to Heaven and let me see my baby.
    <br>Suddenly, a bird came dipped into the water, sprinkling the water around.
    <br>As the sea became calm, 10 minutes later, we saw a big ship coming from Libya.
    <br>They came to rescue us and asked whether we were still going to Italy.
    <br>We said we're going back to prison and they took us to deportation camp in Subratha to Gharyan.
    <br>When we got to Gharyan, we saw many people – Nigerians, Gambians.
    <br>In the deportation camp in Gharyan, people from IOM used to come to check if we were doing fine.
    <br>We would say that we were fine because if we didn't, when the IOM left, they would beat us.
    <br>After this experience, every time IOM came to ask us, we always had to say we were fine.
    <br>They then transferred us from Gharyan to Tajoura.
    <br>As we got to Tajoura, they told us that a Nigerian ambassador has come to register us
    <br>and give us tickets to flight to Nigeria.
    <br>We spent three months before IOM came and shared T-shirts and gave us necessaries.
    <br>We were finally deported to Nigeria and that was this week.
    <br>When we came back, they said we should go back to our states but I said that I didn't want to
    <br>but I wanted to go to The SCOAN and meet the man of God, T.B. Joshua who I had heard about.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN with my friends and as we came, they gave us food and water
    <br>and they gave us 1.2 million Naira to share with my friends.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners - they want to support you, deportees.
    <br>They want to support you with a sum of 1.2 million Naira.
    <br>Deportees Receive 1.2 Million Naira
    <br>From T.B. Joshua & Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>Everybody in this country, Nigeria, please note that it is not safe to travel by land.
    <br>Just wait for God's time and it would be the best.
    <br>If you are a tailor or whatever profession you are, just be satisfied with what you have.
    <br>Ask God to help you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I want to advise young people to try to be yourself and wait for God's time because God's time is the best.
    <br>If I knew, I wouldn't have joined the journey.
    <br>I also learnt my lesson.
    <br>We have heard from the brothers, who have been able to share with us their experiences
    <br>from their journey to Libya.
    <br>They are not the first set of deportees.
    <br>For months, we have been receiving thousands and thousands of deportees from Libya.
    <br>As they said, after their landing here they made the decision to come to The SCOAN, having heard of
    <br>the goodness of the God Almighty through His anointed, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>in the lives of other deportees.
    <br>They said that was why they also made this decision to come down to The SCOAN.
    <br>They are here today sharing their experience.
    <br>When they and thousands of other deportees came to The SCOAN, they were welcomed and given money.
    <br>They have come here to share the experience to the world and give advice that
    <br>if you want embark on any journey abroad, it must be taken legally.
    <br>We have heard their experience.
    <br>They have made their heart desires known to Prophet of God - T.B. Joshua.
    <br>They are here today to receive help from man of God -T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>so that they can be useful to the society and avoid falling into bad companion.
    <br>They have shared their experiences during the Sunday service.
    <br>The man of God has made us understand that we are called to respond to all humans in need -
    <br>that is what love entails.
    <br>We cannot look the other way when our brothers and sisters are in need.
    <br>Jesus Christ has given us that commission to respond to needs of others.
    <br>That is exactly what the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners do.
    <br>In addition to the money already given, the man of God wants to give each of these two brothers
    <br>the sum of 200.000 Naira.
    <br>The purpose of this is to establish them out there.
    <br>They have spent their all savings to go Libya, where they were able to gain nothing -
    <br>they have come back empty-handed.
    <br>In order to prevent them from entering the bad companion in the world Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and Emmanuel TV partners help them financially, apart from the money given them initially.
    <br>They also received a book titled "the Mirror" - a faith building book.
    <br>As you read it your faith will be lifted up - you will see a need to follow Jesus Christ along the way.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for what He has used the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in the lives
    <br>of these two brothers and other people who had been deported from Libya.
    <br>I want to say thank you to Prophet T.B. Joshua for helping me with the sum of 200.000 Naira.
    <br>With this, I will be able to start something.
    <br>I interviewed with several media who targeted us from other countries but nothing returned.
    <br>But with this...
    <br>I don’t know how to express myself but I really want to say thank you
    <br>for everything that you have done for me and my fellow members who are also deportees.
    <br>May God continue to bless you and grant you for many years ahead.
    <br>Thank you for everything you have done for us, sir.
    <br>May God bless you, sir.
    <br>I thank God for my life and Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>for giving me the sum of 200,000 Naira to start up my life.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We have heard the testimony from the brother of what God Almighty has done in his life,
    <br>using the Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>We also give glory to God Almighty for what He has done in your lives.
    <br>We want to advise you that you make sure to follow God along the way,
    <br>making His Word a standard for your life - and the Lord will continue to be with you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you very much.
