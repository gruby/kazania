    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA VISITS THE CITY OF JERUSALEM
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel
    <br>In the heart of the ancient city of Jerusalem is situated the new headquarters of ZAKA,
    <br>the renowned and UN-recognized disaster victim identification organization in Israel.
    <br>Joined by Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav, chairman and co-founder of ZAKA, Prophet T.B. Joshua visited the site
    <br>of the new ZAKA headquarters to review the design of the building.
    <br>We want to bring the design so you can see it here.
    <br>So, there will be an entrance from the road.
    <br>Here we have “Israel Care” as Prophet asked.
    <br>We also believe in it and spoke to our volunteers who think it is a very good idea
    <br>because at the end of the day, we are here to give care to everybody.
    <br>Once we go in, we have our different offices.
    <br>We have our international dispatch center.
    <br>We have our conference room.
    <br>Downstairs, we have all the equipment we need if there is a war or something big around the world.
    <br>All the different units we have in ZAKA, each of them will have a room in this building.
    <br>In here, we can continue the love the Prophet always speaks about, all around the world.
    <br>The Rabbi says the most important thing is that the Prophet’s office in Jerusalem is here.
    <br>This is your home.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel
    <br>Where is this tree here?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel
    <br>One of the main things ZAKA is trying to do around the world is also avoiding bad things.
    <br>We will have classes here to show people the harm that happens everywhere
    <br>and how we can change and be better people.
    <br>Once we are better people, we work from our heart.
    <br>We love each other and we help other people.
    <br>Rabbi wants to say something.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel
    <br>Rabbi says the way you see the layout outside is the real layout.
    <br>What is important here is that there is a lot of light in this building.
    <br>We believe that we can "open the light" to other people, to everybody.
    <br>It is wonderful.
    <br>We want you to keep it, Prophet.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>This is your office in Jerusalem.
    <br>No problem.
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>Look at this place; it starts little but it becomes big tomorrow.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Site Of The New ZAKA Headquarters, Jerusalem, Israel
    <br>Rabbi says this is the beginning but we are with you all the way.
    <br>Under the name "Israel Care", the new ZAKA headquarters is designed to include a permanent office
    <br>for the man of God - Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Rabbi Yehuda embraces the Prophet at the site of the new ZAKA headquarters,
    <br>showing him that he has a home in Israel.

    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives For A Meeting With Religious Leaders In Jerusalem
    <br>Accompanied by Rabbi Yehuda, Prophet T.B. Joshua meets with renowned religious leaders in Jerusalem
    <br>to discuss unity and peace.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives For A Meeting With Religious Leaders In Jerusalem
    <br>Welcome!
    <br>I’m Rabbi David Rosen; a great pleasure to meet you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>This is Mr Oded Wiener.
    <br>We have already met.
    <br>Shalom. Trond Bakkevig from Norway.
    <br>Hello; I’m Bishop Munib Younan.
    <br>Hajj Salah Zuheka.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives For A Meeting With Religious Leaders In Jerusalem
    <br>I am Trond Bakkevig; I am the Convener of the Council of Religious Institutions of the Holy Land.
    <br>We created the Council of Religious Institutions in order to have a continuous entity
    <br>where we could meet constantly from all three religions and you are here.
    <br>The Council was created in order to have open lines of communication between religious leaders
    <br>so that through good times and bad times and in crisis situations,
    <br>there is a possibility of communication to solve problems,
    <br>which we have sometimes managed to do.
    <br>It is all about love; God is love.
    <br>Like the Book of 1 Corinthians 13:13 says, the greatest is love.
    <br>Also in the Hebrew Bible, the love of God appears many more times than the fear of God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let us love one another.
    <br>God is love.
    <br>We must love one another.
    <br>If we preach in love and faith, God preaches.
    <br>If we teach in love and faith, God teaches.
    <br>Love looks around to see who is in need, who is crying, who is unsafe.
    <br>That is love.
    <br>Failing to walk in love almost shuts down our spiritual walk with the Lord.
    <br>When I met Rabbi, I realised what he is doing in Jerusalem, Israel and all over the world
    <br>transcends the issue of religion.
    <br>I said we have to come together and see what we could do.
    <br>We cannot just look to the other side.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives For A Meeting With Religious Leaders In Jerusalem
    <br>In his meeting with religious leaders from the Council of Religious Institutions of the Holy Land,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua emphasizes on the importance of love, as the language that transcends all barriers
    <br>of race, religion, nationality and culture.
    <br>Love is the greatest.
    <br>If love is the greatest, there is nothing we can do without love.
    <br>All our efforts and attributes without love are nothing.
    <br>Thank you for coming.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Meets With Religious Leaders in Jerusalem
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, "The world needs to see our unity and our love for one another".
    <br>In a gesture of unity, the religious leaders of the Holy Land exchange hand shakes with the Prophet
    <br>and express their desire to work together.
    <br>My name is Rabbi David Rosen.
    <br>As I mentioned earlier, once upon a time, I was Rabbi of Seapoint in Cape Town, South Africa.
    <br>I was then Chief Rabbi of Ireland.
    <br>I have been back in Israel since 1985.
    <br>I am the Advisor of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel on International Relations.
    <br>I am part of the Steering Committee of The Council Of Religious Institutions Of The Holy Land.
    <br>I am Oded Wiener.
    <br>I used to be the Director General of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel for 14 years.
    <br>Before that, for 12 years, I was in charge of all the Jewish Holy Sites in Israel.
    <br>Now, I am Advisor to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel on all Interfaith Dialogue around the world.
    <br>It is very interesting to hear about his work for the poor and needy around the world.
    <br>It’s not just in Nigeria but countries like Colombia, Haiti
    <br>and other countries where we heard about his noble work.
    <br>It is very interesting to know the person and hear about his unbelievable work.
    <br>It is an honour for us to meet such a great person.
    <br>Our job here is to promote peace and work together.
    <br>We would be honoured and glad to work together.
    <br>I am Trond Bakkevig; I am a priest of the Church of Norway, Lutheran Church.
    <br>I am here in Jerusalem because I am the Convener of The Council Of Religious Institutions Of The Holy Land.
    <br>The purpose of the Council is to bring the religious leaders of Jerusalem and the Holy Land together
    <br>which are the three religions – the Jewish, the Christian and the Muslim,
    <br>in order to make them an instrument for peace in this land.
    <br>It is nice to meet him and good to hear what he is doing.
    <br>It is impressive to hear what he is doing for relief work around the world.
    <br>I hope we can continue our contacts.
    <br>I am Bishop Munib Younan; I am the Lutheran Bishop of Jerusalem.

    <br>T.B. Joshua Arrives At The Jerusalem Municipality To Meet With The Deputy Mayor Of Jerusalem
    <br>In the square, an acquaintance of the ZAKA founder Rabbi Yehuda welcomes the Prophet to Jerusalem.
    <br>Welcome to Jerusalem.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Arrives At The Jerusalem Municipality To Meet With The Deputy Mayor Of Jerusalem
    <br>I hear you are a friend of Israel, a friend of ZAKA.
    <br>It’s very important for us and for all the people around the world.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Arrives At The Jerusalem Municipality To Meet With The Deputy Mayor Of Jerusalem
    <br>The municipal authorities are housed in the offices of the mayor of Jerusalem, located in Jerusalem district,
    <br>around Safra square in the Daniel Garden.
    <br>It is here that Prophet T.B. Joshua, accompanied by Rabbi Yehuda arrives for a meeting
    <br>with the deputy mayor of Jerusalem.
    <br>Shalom.
    <br>He is in charge of building and building and building more.
    <br>I am in charge of young adult families...
    <br>He makes sure the people get the "right culture", growing up in the right way.
    <br>The magic of Jerusalem is the fact that it’s diverse.
    <br>It’s not just a city of one colour; it has many colours and we can cooperate together.
    <br>Jews and non-Jews, we live all together.
    <br>He says that his office is in a beautiful place.
    <br>We are going to go out and see all the beautiful nature.
    <br>When they come back to their offices, their heads will work better.
    <br>The deputy mayor and the councilman then take the man of God on a tour of the office,
    <br>overlooking the ancient city.

    <br>This is what we call the "New City".
    <br>T.B. Joshua Surveys Jerusalem With Deputy Mayor Yosef Daitsh And Councilman Hanan Rubin
    <br>This is 4,000 years old. In the days of the Holy Temple, this is the place over there.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Surveys Jerusalem With Deputy Mayor Yosef Daitsh And Councilman Hanan Rubin
    <br>This is the old city of Jerusalem and as Yosef said, it is a combination.
    <br>This is an Arab part of the city; Christians and Arabs are over there.
    <br>Jewish people and these are orthodox over there.
    <br>Beautiful, isn't it?
    <br>After showing the Prophet the beautiful views of the historic city of Jerusalem, which is over 4,000 years old,
    <br>they take a photograph together to remember this day.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Meets With Deputy Mayor Of Jerusalem Yosef Daitsh And City Councilman Hanan Rubin
    <br>This is the symbol of Jerusalem - the ‘Lion of the Tribe of Judah’.
    <br>The strong one, being able to stand for many years; 4,000 years.
    <br>It’s a symbol of the Kingdom of the Jewish people, Judah.
    <br>This is a symbol of the Jewish people – the lion.
    <br>Deputy Mayor Of Jerusalem Presents T.B. Joshua With The Lion of the Tribe of Judah Pin
    <br>OK, nice.
    <br>In a gesture of appreciation, the deputy mayor fastens the Lion of the Tribe of Judah pin to the Prophet's shirt.

    <br>Prophet, I have something here; I think this is an appropriate place to do this.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua decided to become one of ZAKA’s leaders,
    <br>helping people no matter what religion they are – Jews, non-Jews, from Israel and all over the world.
    <br>The Chairman, Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav, wants to give you a token of appreciation.
    <br>We give it only to special people who know that our role is to give to one another.
    <br>Rabbi would like to give this to you together with the Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem,
    <br>showing our appreciation for all that you have done and are going to do
    <br>towards helping other people all over the world.
    <br>You deserve much more but this is a small symbol from us.
    <br>Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav Presents T.B. Joshua With The ZAKA Shield Of Humanity Award
    <br>In our Scriptures, it says, if you save one soul, it’s like you save the whole world.
    <br>It looks like you have saved a lot of souls.
    <br>This is the voice of Jesus. If you save one soul, you save the whole world.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Together with the deputy mayor of Jerusalem, Rabbi Yehuda presents T.B. Joshua with

    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA VISITS THE CITY OF HEBRON
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits The Holy Land And Journeys To Hebron
    <br>During his visit to the Holy Land, Prophet T.B. Joshua travels south of Jerusalem to the cave of the patriarchs,
    <br>the tomb of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in Hebron, ancient Judea.
    <br>As recorded in Genesis 23, "Afterward, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah
    <br>near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan".
    <br>This is the visit of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Welcome.
    <br>Abraham buried his wife Sarah here.
    <br>Why did Abraham bury his wife Sarah here?
    <br>He bought this from Ephron.
    <br>Why did he buy this place?
    <br>Because he knew that Adam and Eve were buried over here as well.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>As recorded in Genesis 25, "Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age,
    <br>an old man and full of years".
    <br>His sons, Isaac and Ishmael, buried him in the Cave of Machpelah near Mamre.
    <br>There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.
    <br>Above this big structure, there is a church from the time of the Crusaders which was built on top of this structure.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>This is the Seventh Step.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>The Jews used to come to the Seventh Step, which is over here.
    <br>Today, thank God, since we liberated in 1967, we can enter the cave.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>When we speak about the actual graves, you have to understand they are three stories down.
    <br>Herod built this structure; then the Turks, the Ottomans came and built this structure.
    <br>And because it is a holy place, they built two mosques on top.
    <br>And still today, we have a church on the roof which was built in the time of the Crusaders.
    <br>Come, please.
    <br>The history of this Biblical site is recalled, as Prophet T.B. Joshua arrives at the entrance
    <br>to the Cave of the Patriarchs.
    <br>Let us follow his journey, as he visits the tombs of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
    <br>who requested in Genesis 49, "Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron".
    <br>"There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife,
    <br>there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife,
    <br>and there I buried Leah." (Genesis 49:31)
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua makes his way up the steps, not just to see the resting place of the heroes of faith
    <br>but to honour the God they served.
    <br>We cannot help but remember the voice of Jesus in Matthew 22, "Have you not read what God said to you,
    <br>‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?"
    <br>He is not the God of the dead but of the living.
    <br>Tomb of Abraham.
    <br>Tomb of Sarah.
    <br>At this precious site of the burial place of father Abraham and his wife Sarah, some of the heroes of faith,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>His heart deeply engaged with God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua spends a moment at the tomb of Abraham,
    <br>adorned with references to the Holy Scriptures.

    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>The Cave of the Patriarchs – four patriarchs and matriarchs were buried here 4,000 years ago.
    <br>You are touching the Bible here, the Old Testament.
    <br>Please, come.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>Continuing around the outside of the structure, Prophet T.B. Joshua makes his way to the wall that is believed
    <br>to surround the exact location of the resting place of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah
    <br>- a sacred site, which has become a place of prayer.
    <br>Standing with Rabbi Yehuda Meshi Zahav, Prophet T.B. Joshua offers a prayer to the God of Abraham,
    <br>Isaac and Jacob, in Jesus' name.
    <br>He then continues through the spiritual monument.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>We are standing here; this rock where we stood is what is called the Seventh Step.
    <br>Because so many people, generations, over hundreds of years stood in this place,
    <br>like the Wailing Wall and prayed and cried and asked God for whatever,
    <br>today we believe that if someone comes and also sits here and has a problem in life,
    <br>and wants to ask God for something, anything -
    <br>for a medical problem, financial problem or fertility problem,
    <br>people come here to pray and God hears and accepts their prayers.
    <br>The tradition is that this is the entrance to Paradise.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>Hi.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I'm great.
    <br>It is nice to see you here.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Visits Cave Of The Patriarchs - The Tomb Of Abraham, Isaac And Jacob In Hebron
    <br>Prophet, we are standing here near an olive tree orchard.
    <br>Somewhere over here was King David’s palace.
    <br>King David became king in Hebron.
    <br>He was king for 40 years – 7 years in Hebron and another 33 years in Jerusalem.
    <br>As 2 Samuel accounts, David asked, 'Where shall I go?' 'To Hebron', the Lord answered.
    <br>Then the men of Judah came to Hebron, and there they anointed David king over the tribe of Judah".
    <br>Welcome to one of the most ancient places in Israel, maybe in the world.
    <br>Please come.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua continues past David's Hebron palace and the tombs of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
    <br>to a hilltop near the Cave of Machpelach and enters a small ancient edifice, the tombs of Jesse,
    <br>father of King David, and Ruth, the great-grandmother of King David.
    <br>This is believed to be the tomb of Jesse, father of King David, and Ruth, the great-grandmother.
    <br>Hi.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Inside The Tomb Of Jesse And Ruth In Hebron
    <br>This is a ram's horn.
    <br>We believe, on our special day once a year, that when we blow this, anyone who hears the sound should think
    <br>about all the bad they did around the year and make sure that next year, they're not going to do it again.

    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua On A Hilltop In Hebron - The Site Of The Tomb Of Jesse And Ruth
    <br>Continuing through the complex, Prophet T.B. Joshua arrives at yet another ancient structure.
    <br>Prophet, there are hundreds of structures like this in Hebron.
    <br>I want to show you something.
    <br>This is an old structure, probably dated about 1,000 years ago.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua In Hebron Near The Site Of The Tomb Of Jesse And Ruth
    <br>Making their way out of the small entrance at the back of the structure, barely large enough to pass through,
    <br>they find themselves in an open grassy field in front of another edifice.
    <br>Passing through a tiny opening reveals an ancient room,
    <br>where Prophet T.B. Joshua immediately kneels down to pray.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Prays In An Ancient Synagogue In Hebron
    <br>Prayer is the shortest route between your heart and God.
    <br>God Almighty delights in hearing the prayers of His righteous children.
    <br>We pray not to pull God to our mind but to bring ourselves to His.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua In Hebron Near The Site Of The Tomb Of Jesse And Ruth
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua At The Tomb Of Jesse And Ruth Near The Cave Of The Patriarchs In Hebron
    <br>Leaving the tombs of Jesse and Ruth, Prophet T.B. Joshua returns to the area believed to be the location
    <br>of the Hebron palace of King David.
    <br>As he surveys the grassy field, one can only imagine the view of the area in the time of David,
    <br>a man whose devotion and commitment to God and His Word
    <br>earned him divine recognition as a man after God's own heart,
    <br>a man who prayed in Psalm 130, "I wait for the Lord, my soul waits and in His Word I do hope.
    <br>My soul waits for the Lord, more than those who watch for the morning".
    <br>Somewhere over here, we believe was the castle of King David.
    <br>What I can tell you for sure is that King David, as a young shepherd, used to walk around here.
    <br>That was 4,000 years ago.

    <br>We are looking East.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron
    <br>In the Southeast was the Biblical city of Sodom.
    <br>Lot, the brother of Abraham, came from Sodom.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron
    <br>God said He was going to annihilate Sodom because of the bad things happening there.
    <br>Abraham speaks to God and says that maybe there are 100 righteous in Sodom.
    <br>God says no and Abraham asks if maybe there are 50 righteous in Sodom.
    <br>50, 40, 30, 10 - not 1.
    <br>And then God annihilates Sodom.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron
    <br>During the day, if we were here, we could look into Jordan.
    <br>We would see the Dead Sea; we are looking East.
    <br>What happens after Abraham, our father, speaks to God?
    <br>He says the first prayer to God in the world.
    <br>It is believed to be over here.
    <br>We are standing in the place where the first prayer to God was prayed to God.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron
    <br>Let's go to the structure over here.

    <br>Entering a small structure on the hill, a Bible is opened and they begin to read.
    <br>“And the Lord appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamre” (Genesis 18:1).
    <br>Mamre is 1 kilometre South of here.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua In The Holy Land, Hebron
    <br>“As he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day” (Genesis 18:1).
    <br>Abraham was sitting in the heat of the day and three angels came
    <br>and told Abraham that Sarah was going to have Isaac.
    <br>It happened 1 kilometre South of here.
    <br>This is where Abraham prayed the first prayer to God
    <br>and this is also the place where Abraham and Lot separated.
    <br>Lot went back to Sodom and Abraham went the other direction.
    <br>There is a tradition here and we are not sure which tradition it is, regarding these footprints.
    <br>We don’t know which tradition it is but it says these footprints are of Abraham when he prayed.
    <br>Do you see those two footprints?
    <br>It is a tradition. We think...
    <br>I brought an archeologist here about two months ago.
    <br>He told me that this is a Christian structure because it faces East, South East.
    <br>This is a Christian structure that was built 900 years ago.

    <br>You can step here.

    <br>I want to remove my shoes.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua In Hebron At The Footprints Of Abraham
    <br>James 2:23, "And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, 'Abraham believed God,
    <br>and it was accounted to him for righteousness, and he was called the friend of God".
    <br>I want to pray.
    <br>In whatever form you pray, if our action is genuine, the Holy Spirit will affect it.

    <br>We left Jerusalem, we drove South on route 60 - this is the "Kings Road".
    <br>We drove to Hebron.
    <br>Then we drove out of Hebron and we took a right turn down here and we are right here.
    <br>We'd looked East into Jordan as I told you, and we would see the Dead Sea if we were here during the day.
    <br>Of course, it is not enough that Abraham our father was here.
    <br>Who was also here?
    <br>This is where King David wrote The Psalms as he fled from King Saul.
    <br>There is a village here at a junction, called Ziph.
    <br>It says in the Bible, that when King David, before he was king, was fleeing from King Saul,
    <br>because King Saul wanted to kill him, he was hiding in the village of Ziph.
    <br>The Ziphim came and wanted to extradite him to King Saul but it didn't happen in the end
    <br>because he said a special prayer to God.
    <br>It happened 500 meters from here.

    <br>Concluding this spiritual journey overlooking the ancient grounds of Hebron, Prophet T.B. Joshua takes a moment
    <br>for reflection in a sacred place, where God Almighty communed with His holy people,
    <br>as we can read in the Bible today.
    <br>As it was, so it is; the Lord speaks to our hearts through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>And when God speaks, the wise listen.
