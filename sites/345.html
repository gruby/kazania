    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line
    <br>3 months ago she had an accident and she could not do anything since that time.
    <br>She is from a French speaking country?
    <br>Whether it is Togo or Lome, it is French speaking.
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>No matter the situation you are in.
    <br>After your healing, you have to reduce your stature.
    <br>It's a burden - this body.
    <br>So to reduce this stature is not to eat anything -
    <br>not everything you see!
    <br>You have to reduce this stature!
    <br>You will be healed and I will make sure that you reduce this stature.
    <br>So people in French speaking countries - never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Right now, be rescued!
    <br>Be healed!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line

    <br>Reduce your stature!
