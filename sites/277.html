  <p>    
    <br>Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua ministering prayer at The SCOAN prayer line.
    <br>He has been sent in the name of the Lord  to break the powers of darkness of
    <br>all those who have come afflicted with various hindrances, sicknesses and diseases.
    <br>Powers and principalities are nullified in full at the mention of the name Jesus Christ.
    <br>Look at the reaction of this woman, as she receives prayer in Jesus' name.
    <br>- Who are you?
    <br>- I told you we are many.
    <br>Ancestral spirits, the great lion.
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>I have destroyed her - everything.
    <br>I have given her powers.
    <br>- How many powers?
    <br>- Too many.
    <br>- Where they are located?
    <br>- Eyes, tongue - her whole body.
    <br>I make her do anything I send her.
    <br>Like what? Speak out. How do you operate?
    <br>I have given her wisdom to do what I want her to do.
    <br>She is a witch doctor.
    <br>I have given her powers to create things that people want to have
    <br>like other's people husbands, positions.
    <br>I speak to her.
    <br>I have given her wisdom to do what I want her to do:
    <br>to break people's marriages, to break homes.
    <br>On our knee!
    <br>Come out.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prays, she spins, then falls down delivered, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>She is now free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Olipha Dube and I'm from South Africa.
    <br>I am 34 years of age.
    <br>I am standing here, in front of you to share my wonderful testimony
    <br>of the wonderful deliverance that I got here at The SCOAN.
    <br>God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver me from a life of evil spirits that were tormenting me.
    <br>I was a witch doctor, a herbalist, a traditional healer in my country.
    <br>This is the time to expose the kingdom of darkness
    <br>and what the devil is doing in so many people's lives by deceiving them
    <br>to believe that witchcraft, witch doctors, herbalists and traditional healers have a solution.
    <br>As a matter of fact, they don't.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>Professionally, I am a registered nurse.
    <br>After completing my diploma, I went into business in the nursing industry.
    <br>I had a placement agency for nurses in South Africa
    <br>and in 2005, I was awarded a tender with the Department of Health
    <br>where I was supplying nurses to government hospitals on an ad hoc basis.
    <br>My business was going very well, everything was OK
    <br>until I started experiencing problems.
    <br>It was a life of problems every single day.
    <br>Until one day, a friend introduced me to a witch doctor, a herbalist.
    <br>I went there in search of solution for the problems that I had in my business and life in general.
    <br>When I got there, they gave me charms.
    <br>From the first day you walked into a witch doctor's place,
    <br>it was just charms that were given to you.
    <br>They gave me charms to try and help me with the problems that I had.
    <br>I found that when I was using those charms,
    <br>they would work for a few days or a week
    <br>but soon afterwards, the problems would be worse than before.
    <br>The solutions I would get would either be temporary or not work at all.
    <br>That caused me to go from one witch doctor to another
    <br>in search of a lasting solution or greater power.
    <br>I kept on going on and on like that until one day
    <br>I went to another witch doctor who told me that those other witch doctors
    <br>I had been to before could not help me because I had a gift from the ancestors
    <br>and I was supposed to be a witch doctor.
    <br>In our country, it is called inyanga or sangoma.
    <br>I agreed.
    <br>To me at that time, I thought it was a solution.
    <br>I agreed.
    <br>I went through the initiation school; they initiated me.
    <br>From the very first day when you go to the initiation school, you are given charms.
    <br>Charms were put all over your body,
    <br>incisions are made all over your body to put in those charms
    <br>that give you powers to see what other people didn't see
    <br>and powers to be able to communicate with the spiritual world.
    <br>After I finished my initiation school,
    <br>I went and practiced as a traditional healer, a sangoma at that time.
    <br>I have to explain that in our country, in this field, there are categories.
    <br>Sangomas were basically the entry level into the industry.
    <br>From there, as I had continued to practice, I found that as a sangoma, my resources were limited.
    <br>There were other things that I could not do because as a sangoma, you were not taught much.
    <br>You were given just a little bit of knowledge and you were expected
    <br>to depend on your initiator for problems that you could not solve.
    <br>I found that as I practiced, I would come across clients
    <br>that would require assistance and I would not be able to help them
    <br>because my powers were sort of limited.
    <br>Then, I went in search of more powers and more knowledge
    <br>to be able to practice to a broader scale into my field.
    <br>Then, I went to another initiator.
    <br>I paid a lot of money and then, he taught me how to use plants, herbs, trees,
    <br>to mix them with animal parts to produce whatever charms that you wanted to produce.
    <br>When you were in the process of being taught, the schooling,
    <br>charms were also used on your own body to enhance the knowledge quicker,
    <br>to make you fit into the whole thing.
    <br>In the process of learning how to use charms, I would also use charms on myself.
    <br>I had lived a life of using charms constantly on a daily basis,
    <br>in order to enhance my powers and to be in a level to communicate quicker, better on a daily basis.
    <br>My daily routine was a routine of charms, from waking up in the morning,
    <br>before I could speak to anyone, I had to speak to the ancestors
    <br>at my altar to thank them for what they did for me, and ask for guidance.
    <br>The spirits would come and communicate with me.
    <br>They would tell me how my day was going to be.
    <br>They would tell me the challenges that I was going to meet,
    <br>people that were going to come and see me or that I would go to meet.
    <br>They told me the charms to use so as to be able to succeed through the day.
    <br>From talking to my altar, when I went to bathe,
    <br>I bathed with charms according to what they had told me.
    <br>OK sister, at this point we want you to describe the altar you were talking about.
    <br>Where is it located? Is it in your house, or it is a separate building?
    <br>Just describe it.
    <br>As an inyanga, I had an altar in my bedroom.
    <br>Let's say, at night I had a dream, a message from the ancestors,
    <br>I had to quickly go to the altar and communicate.
    <br>You are required to have an altar in your own bedroom.
    <br>Then, there was another altar that you had outside your house but in your yard.
    <br>You were supposed to build a separate house or room for the ancestors
    <br>in your house, which was mainly used by them only.
    <br>You would use there to store your charms and for consultation.
    <br>So, this evil altar was actually a separate building entirely,
    <br>that was purely dedicated to these evil spirits,
    <br>that were communicating to you as a witch doctor?
    <br>Yes and depending on how many ancestors you were initiated into,
    <br>in my case, I was initiated into the ancestors from my mother's side
    <br>and ancestors from my father's side.
    <br>In my yard, I had two rooms, two houses for the ancestors,
    <br>one for my father's side and one for my mother's side.
    <br>We want you to describe to us how people would come to you.
    <br>Just give us an example of the kind of request they would make,
    <br>and the type of charms that you would provide for them,
    <br>and how you would actually make these charms.
    <br>Basically, the services that you would provide as an inyanga or sangoma,
    <br>you were sort of like a one-stop-shop.
    <br>You were expected to provide solutions for a variety of problems.
    <br>For example, a client came, a young lady would come and she would say
    <br>that she could not get married or that no man looked at her.
    <br>It was as if she was invisible; no man had come to approach her
    <br>to ask for marriage or anything like that.
    <br>I would be expected to assist her to get whoever that she wanted.
    <br>Our point of departure would be that I would ask her if she had
    <br>a specific person in mind that she wanted.
    <br>Sometimes, you would find that they wanted people who were already married.
    <br>Sometimes, they wanted pastors; it depended.
    <br>Depending on what or whom she wanted, then that would be our point of departure.
    <br>The stronger the person that she wanted, the stronger the charms that we would have to use.
    <br>We would come to an agreement.
    <br>If she was willing to pay what I wanted her to pay,
    <br>we would go all the way to getting her what she wanted.
    <br>Most of the time, we got what we wanted.
    <br>This specific example you used - the lady looking for a husband:
    <br>What charms would you use for her and describe how would you make the charm - the ingredients.
    <br>This is the information that inyangas, traditional healers would not tell you.
    <br>Even when you walked into their altar rooms,
    <br>and you found bottles of charms labelled, they didn't use the correct names
    <br>to label what was in the bottles because should people know what was in there,
    <br>I think they would run away.
    <br>In this case, a lady wanted to get attention from this man who was already married,
    <br>meaning, we first had to create the attention.
    <br>It means that this man could not see her.
    <br>We had to use herbs, plants, trees to get this man's attention.
    <br>In our country, I am a Zulu.
    <br>In Zulu culture, every tree, plant and animal had a name.
    <br>You would find that most of the time,
    <br>trees and plants were named according to their characteristics.
    <br>Let me make an example of a tree called, 'Umkhanyakude' meaning
    <br>'Light from afar' or 'Light from a distance'.
    <br>If you take that tree and you steam or bath a person with that plant,
    <br>the effect would be that if she appears, she would appear as fake light.
    <br>She would be visible and everybody would want to speak to her.
    <br>She would be attractive and the centre of attraction.
    <br>That was what we would use.
    <br>But in this case because we were using it for a specific person,
    <br>we would have to mention the person's name -
    <br>that this charm was supposed to work on Mr So-and-so.
    <br>When she walked in the presence of Mr So-and-so, definitely he would recognise her.
    <br>After we had gotten Mr So-and-so attention, we had to move on to a stronger level
    <br>where we were supposed to create affection.
    <br>To create affection, we would probably move to another level of using animals.
    <br>In this case, you had to know the characteristics and characters of different animals
    <br>in order to choose according to the outcome that you were expecting.
    <br>In this case, we would use a female dog at a certain time.
    <br>When the dog was captured - it would not be captured at any time -
    <br>it would be at the time of mating.
    <br>We knew that at that time the dog would be enraged,
    <br>it was uncontrollable and just wanted to mate.
    <br>You would get that dog, remove the parts you required from that dog,
    <br>dry them in the sun and mash them.
    <br>When people came, they would just see powder.
    <br>They didn't know that it was actually an animal.
    <br>We would do incisions and put that animal together with other charms
    <br>in the person's body and blood.
    <br>That is going to produce that effect that you got
    <br>from the behaviour of the dog in that person's life.
    <br>When Mr So-and-so saw this lady, something would happen to him -
    <br>he would just lust after this lady.
    <br>Now, in this particular instance; the person concerned -
    <br>do you mean that spirit of dog would now enter the person?
    <br>That spirit would have entered that person at that time.
    <br>OK. We are just asking these questions so that people of God can learn.
    <br>As our sister said, so many people just seek charms
    <br>but they don't actually know what's happening behind the scenes for these charms to be made.
    <br>You mean, sister that even upon the charms that are given to such a person,
    <br>it would not actually give them solution, it would actually cause greater problems,
    <br>once the charm actually was in effect?
    <br>Yes, if the charm provided a solution, it would be temporary.
    <br>It would be OK for a month.
    <br>The person would come and tell you, "I'm very happy. Mr So-and-so has approached me
    <br>and we are actually in a relationship."
    <br>But after a short period of time, things would become worse.
    <br>The man would actually start to hate this woman and not only him,
    <br>every other man would hate her; it would be even worse than before.
    <br>You would find that when the person kept on coming to you that
    <br>she would tell you that she felt that she was in a worse situation than before.
    <br>At that stage, people would start moving from one witch doctor to another
    <br>because they would think that your charms were not powerful enough.
    <br>Most of the people who go to witch doctors hip-hop
    <br>from one witch doctor to another; that was the reason.
    <br>And each witch doctor they are going to is entangling them deeper in darkness
    <br>and initiating them with more and more problems.
    <br>The more they go to witch doctors, the more they use charms and
    <br>the more they go deeper and deeper into problems.
    <br>This was exactly what was happening to me as the witch doctor.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Apart from the issue of a lady asking for a man to be attracted to her,
    <br>can you give us another example of common cases someone would bring to you,
    <br>and the charm that you would use for that person?
    <br>Another example was when a gentleman came,
    <br>saying that he wanted his boss' position -
    <br>maybe his boss was a CEO and he wanted that position.
    <br>He did not have qualifications but he wanted the position.
    <br>So, it means that we had to create a situation where we'd move the CEO
    <br>and he would be appointed.
    <br>In that case, we would go around and see which animals we could use
    <br>in order to produce that temporary image, so to speak,
    <br>for the particular man, so that he could get the position he wanted.
    <br>At the same time, we would also create problems for the CEO in this case
    <br>so that he would feel uncomfortable in the position.
    <br>He would either be fired or step down
    <br>and then this person would be appointed.
    <br>Basically, those were the services we were providing
    <br>but the industry had made people believe that there was a solution for everything.
    <br>You would find that in the beginning, it might look like there was a solution for everything
    <br>but believe me, the solutions would not last.
    <br>Instead, they put people into deeper spiritual problems.
    <br>Madam, we want to be very clear because we know viewers around the world are watching,
    <br>people present here are listening to you, and there is a lot of lessons that can be learnt.
    <br>You mean to say that anyone who receives a charm from a witch doctor and uses it,
    <br>instead of actually bringing a solution to the problem, the solution would be temporary,
    <br>and it would increase the person's problem, causing them to move to even more witch doctors,
    <br>and by so doing initiate them deeper into darkness and more into the problems.
    <br>Is that the purpose of witch doctors just to cause the people to go into more and more problems?
    <br>I could say that their aim was to get people hooked
    <br>because once a person was hooked, I don't think it was possible to get them out.
    <br>I am also speaking for myself
    <br>because as a person who was providing that service for people,
    <br>I was also in problems that I could not get myself out of.
    <br>So, I found that in a situation like that, people went hunting for greater power.
    <br>The more you hunt for greater power, the more you expose yourself into deeper problems
    <br>because you could even get to the level where you go to traditional healers
    <br>who used human body parts to create charms.
    <br>I believe we all are listening to our sister and learning from her experience.
    <br>She herself was involved in this business,
    <br>so what she is saying she says from her own personal experience.
    <br>Now sister, we hear a lot in the church here about people manifesting the things
    <br>such as spiritual husband, spiritual wives.
    <br>As a witch doctor - people would come to you requesting that you assign
    <br>a spiritual husband to a particular person - how would you go about doing that?
    <br>In this case, let us say a client came and said, "This lady is my enemy
    <br>and I want to destroy her; I want to teach her a lesson."
    <br>We knew that the best way to create problems in a person's life
    <br>was to get a spiritual husband or a spiritual wife.
    <br>In this case, we would go to the graves to raise this spirits.
    <br>How we raised the spirits - we had to know our charms.
    <br>We used those charms that we knew its purpose was to raise.
    <br>They could raise anything - war, confusion, poverty -
    <br>depending on how we spoke to them.
    <br>I wanted to raise the dead spirit, so I went to the grave and would choose any grave.
    <br>If you wanted to raise a spiritual husband for a woman,
    <br>you would choose a male grave.
    <br>In our country, most of our graves have tombstones
    <br>and the name of the owner of the grave is written on the tombstone.
    <br>So, I would randomly select any male grave
    <br>while looking at the name on the tombstone.
    <br>I would then put the charms there.
    <br>The most important thing was that you needed to buy the spirit.
    <br>So, I would use a coin to buy the spirit and then raise the spirit.
    <br>I would tell the spirit that as from that day, it was married to so and so,
    <br>so and so was your wife.
    <br>You were going to stay with her
    <br>and do all the duties that a husband would do to and for a wife.
    <br>Her children were your children; her home was your home.
    <br>She would never do anything without your approval.
    <br>If she did something without your approval, you were not going to allow her.
    <br>That was basically how we did that.
    <br>What would then happen to the person that you were sending the spiritual husband to?
    <br>We would not see because remember this person that we were fighting against
    <br>we don't even know them.
    <br>I only knew my clients.
    <br>It was my clients that would come to me and say they were very happy.
    <br>Now, so and so's life was in shambles. She lost her job.
    <br>This and that was happening. Her husband left her.
    <br>I wouldn't know. I only got to know for the very first time when I saw Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Wow. So, such a person would then begin to experience dreams,
    <br>where a spiritual husband would come to them,
    <br>and then the subsequent destruction in their live would occur.
    <br>Sister, at this point we want to ask you a question.
    <br>If you encounter someone who wanted to send such a spirit
    <br>or use a charm against someone who is a Christian, a genuine child of God -
    <br>just describe what would happen, if you have ever had such an encounter.
    <br>Yes, I have had Christian clients.
    <br>People who would come to me calling themselves Christians
    <br>or born again looking for help for the very same reasons that everybody else
    <br>who came to me was looking for -
    <br>looking for someone else's husband, someone else's job, promotion or a child.
    <br>First of all, a lady would come and say she wanted the pastor to marry her.
    <br>The pastor was married but she wanted the pastor to divorce his wife and marry her.
    <br>We would do the same procedure.
    <br>First of all, we would throw the bones and look into the pastor's life.
    <br>When we were looking into the pastor's life,
    <br>at that time, I only knew the person's weakness or entry points.
    <br>You looked into the pastor's life and found out how strong they were.
    <br>The bones would tell you that this person was a person of prayer
    <br>but this person could not control his temper.
    <br>Then, I would know that their temper was my entry point
    <br>or maybe this person's prayer life was not constant.
    <br>Some days he prayed seven times, some days he prayed two times
    <br>and some days he forgot.
    <br>So, I would watch for that day when he forgot to pray to attack.
    <br>So, you mean to say that if someone is consistent as a Christian, and consistent in prayer -
    <br>would you be able to attack such a person?
    <br>No, basically what we would do; we didn't follow a person for a very long time.
    <br>We would basically give it like a seven day period in monitoring this particular person.
    <br>After the seventh day, if the person was consistent,
    <br>then we would need to give up and try after six months or later
    <br>but I had never had an encounter where in these seven days
    <br>there was no weakness that I found
    <br>that would assist me to penetrate the person's life.
    <br>So, it would be like that; if we saw that this person's problem was temper,
    <br>then we were going to create situations in his life
    <br>that would cause him to be temperamental all the time.
    <br>We created problems at work because we knew that he was going to lose his temper.
    <br>We created problems at home; we knew he was going to lose his temper.
    <br>Everywhere, we created problems.
    <br>When they were busy entertaining that life of temper, then we were able to penetrate.
    <br>Viewers, I believe we are all listening and we are learning from our sister's experience.
    <br>Just to completely understand you, sister;
    <br>you mean to say that for example you are trying to attack a pastor or cause a divorce
    <br>in a life of a pastor, a minister of God or a genuine Christian,
    <br>you would be looking to see the weaknesses of that person,
    <br>and the weakness of that person, maybe it is a spirit of anger, or lust,
    <br>it would be the avenue for you to enter and cause such an attack.
    <br>But if the person is strong in prayer and consistent, you would not be able to attack.
    <br>Is that correct?
    <br>If a person is strong and consistent for that period of time,
    <br>then, we couldn't do much.
    <br>We had to wait for some time and tell the client to wait for three to six months.
    <br>In the meantime, we would try other things.
    <br>Could they access their clothing?
    <br>Could they get their pictures?
    <br>What was in contact with this man's body
    <br>that they could get for us so that we could try and use it?
    <br>During your deliverance the evil spirit mentioned that you had some specific powers
    <br>located in parts of your body.
    <br>Could you just explain what those powers were and how you used them?
    <br>The powers that I had were powers in my eyes, tongue and all over my body.
    <br>If you were to take a look at my body, you would see that I had incisions everywhere,
    <br>even in my private parts and everywhere, where I put charms to enhance or give me power.
    <br>This would be powers to see, like I just explained we were able to see;
    <br>sort of like prophecy; we could see a person's life - past, present and future,
    <br>and further on, be able to identify where the problem was.
    <br>The powers you had were basically to assist to connect more with the spirits
    <br>because the spirits were now giving you information
    <br>and knowledge on a continuous basis.
    <br>You were supposed to always be connected to the spiritual world.
    <br>For example, if I was in a mall and standing next to a person,
    <br>the spirit would be telling me that this person's name was so and so
    <br>and these were his problems.
    <br>I am sure people from South Africa had been through experiences
    <br>where they just met a sangoma and they would start telling them about their lives.
    <br>This was how it happened; you would meet this person
    <br>and the spirit would start telling you that this was so and so, these were their problems
    <br>and then you would approach the person, Mr So-and-so.
    <br>Obviously, they would be shocked; who was this, who was calling their names?
    <br>"My name is So-and-so and this is what I am seeing in your life.
    <br>There are problems in your life; you are not sleeping at night
    <br>or there are problems at work or you are fighting with your wife and I can help you."
    <br>Everybody is looking for a solution.
    <br>Once they heard the words, "I can help you,"
    <br>they would actually put it together with the information that you had given them
    <br>and they would be convinced that actually you had a solution.
    <br>The next thing I would do was give them my phone numbers.
    <br>They would call, make an appointment, then come.
    <br>So, this power would enable you to see and prophecy to other people's lives,
    <br>but you didn't have the power to actually solve their problems.
    <br>Just by coming and enticing them in, you would be able to initiate them
    <br>with the charms and then introduce them to even greater problems.
    <br>Yes, but when we were taught, we were not told that.
    <br>We were told that we were providing solutions for people.
    <br>But when you were doing it, you realised that there was no solution.
    <br>The solutions were temporary.
    <br>They would either not work at all or they were temporary.
    <br>And each person that came, they would have to pay a fee,
    <br>and you'd collect money from them according to the charm they wanted.
    <br>Yes. There was no consultation for free.
    <br>Consultation had a charge and the charge was only for consultation.
    <br>Consultation was when we used the bones.
    <br>We threw the bones on the floor and got the information we wanted
    <br>about the past, present and future.
    <br>Subsequently, after we had identified the problems,
    <br>if the person said, "OK, can you help me solve these problems?",
    <br>we moved to the next level.
    <br>When we moved to the next level, they had to pay.
    <br>They paid according to the problems.
    <br>The deeper the problems, the more the money.
    <br>At this point sister, we want to ask you:
    <br>With all the finances you were receiving, as a witch doctor,
    <br>you said that in the midst of this you yourself was still facing terrible problems.
    <br>Do you mean to say that in spite of the powers you possessed
    <br>and the people that were coming to you for help,
    <br>you were still encountering these situations.
    <br>In the midst of all that, I would find that most of the time,
    <br>the charms I would use for people would work temporarily on them.
    <br>To me, they would not work at all, most of the time.
    <br>In the process, I found myself having more and more problems in my business.
    <br>and as a result I lost my business.
    <br>I lost all my assets.
    <br>I basically lost everything in that process.
    <br>It was then I realised that this thing did not work.
    <br>I was very upset, bitter and angry.
    <br>I decided that it was time for me to find something else.
    <br>But, when I made the decision to find something else,
    <br>I had not made the decision to find God.
    <br>Because of the Christians that were coming for consultation,
    <br>I did not know that in Christianity there was solution.
    <br>I told myself that I would go on further in search of this power I did not know.
    <br>I went to a lot of other herbalists, traditional healers and witch doctors.
    <br>They couldn't help me, instead, my situation got worse and worse
    <br>until I lost everything.
    <br>Tell us about how at this point God Almighty led you to the ministry here, The SCOAN.
    <br>I was then, in my country, what we call a 'mogela',
    <br>meaning, I had now opened my own initiation school
    <br>to initiate other people to become traditional healers, sangomas and inyangas like myself.
    <br>My sister was one of the people that I initiated.
    <br>In the spiritual world, I was their father.
    <br>They would not call me by my name; they would call me father.
    <br>In our Zulu language, they would call me 'Baba'.
    <br>These people basically worshipped me.
    <br>When they spoke to me, they had to be on their knees.
    <br>They couldn't look me in the eye.
    <br>They called me father and I called them children.
    <br>They were my children.
    <br>These were elderly people, people that were older than me!
    <br>One of 'my children', one of my initiates came to me and said -
    <br>at that time I had tried, I had been to churches also in search of solution,
    <br>I had tried deliverances before - they did not work.
    <br>I thought that probably there was no solution.
    <br>Then, she came to me and said to me, "There is this channel
    <br>that I want you to take a look at and I believe it is going to help you."
    <br>These people had so much faith in me and in what I could do
    <br>and in what I could produce as a traditional healer,
    <br>when I stopped, they also stopped because they were sort of confused.
    <br>She told me about Emmanuel TV, then she came together with her husband,
    <br>put the settings on and I started watching.
    <br>From that very day, I was shocked.
    <br>I saw people manifesting,
    <br>people actually talking about the very same things that we would do to other people.
    <br>These things were manifesting in their lives.
    <br>People were saying that they were dogs, spiritual husbands, anger, this and that.
    <br>I was shocked.
    <br>Then, the other thing that shocked me the most, was how the demons were cast out.
    <br>I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua and the wise men commanding the spirits
    <br>to go out just like that.
    <br>One word, 'out', and the spirit was gone.
    <br>I said, "No, this is impossible. This cannot be happening."
    <br>I looked at the effort we had to go through in putting the charms together.
    <br>It was hard to put an effective charm together
    <br>because when your charms are effective, you would get a good name
    <br>and that would attract more clients.
    <br>These charms that we worked so hard for were cast out by one word.
    <br>I thought, "No, there must be something to this man."
    <br>I started watching.
    <br>I saw people with the same problems that I had.
    <br>At that time, I knew that this was where my solution would come from.
    <br>Wow. Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>We thank Jesus.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God for Emmanuel TV that God is using to change lives, nations and the world.
    <br>Sister, we know that by the grace of God you came to The SCOAN.
    <br>We watched the clip earlier how you were in the prayer line and Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you.
    <br>Can you just describe that experience?
    <br>What happened to you in the prayer line?
    <br>At the prayer line, as we were standing there, the prophet was approaching us.
    <br>As he got closer and closer to where I was, I felt this force -
    <br>I can basically explain it as force - this big force blew me.
    <br>As it blew me, I felt something in my stomach, deep inside my stomach
    <br>shifting and shaking my intestines in an uncontrollable way.
    <br>At that very time, something was telling me in my head that "You have time,
    <br>you can run. The best thing to do now is run, run away."
    <br>Actually, it was showing me how, "Look at your left."
    <br>I looked at my left hand side and saw a gap between two people that were standing there.
    <br>The spirit said, "You can actually run and escape through that passage between those two people."
    <br>I actually wanted to do that but as I tried to move, something got hold of my feet.
    <br>I could not move.
    <br>Olipha Dube
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Remember, this thing happened very fast.
    <br>I had this conversation inside of me and in the meantime, the prophet was approaching.
    <br>As he approached me, the force got stronger and stronger
    <br>and I could not resist it.
    <br>I never thought that would happen to me.
    <br>The last thing that I remember was the prophet asking me, "Who are you?"
    <br>But what I saw was not the prophet.
    <br>I have to say that what I saw was not the prophet. I cannot explain it.
    <br>I saw a man who was full of power and authority.
    <br>I felt as if he was looking deep inside my heart.
    <br>He knew everything about me.
    <br>He knew what I was thinking.
    <br>He knew where I was from.
    <br>I could not hide what I was feeling.
    <br>I just had to surrender right there.
    <br>Olipha Dube
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Before I knew it, this lady grabbed me by my hand and said,
    <br>"Sister, rise up, you are delivered."
    <br>I knew something was happening.
    <br>Bits and pieces of everything, I could see them but I had no control.
    <br>Everything happened so fast, I couldn't even think of anything at that time.
    <br>Wow. We give glory to God that our sister is standing her     delivered.
    <br>Tell us sister, ever since your deliverance, what is your testimony.
    <br>Ever since my deliverance, I have to mention that in that life I used to live,
    <br>I was living in constant fear.
    <br>People did not know this but I was afraid.
    <br>I even gave my car away because I was even scared to drive.
    <br>This information, nobody knew, even my family didn't know.
    <br>I don't know what they are thinking right now as they are watching.
    <br>I gave my car away because I was too scared to drive.
    <br>I was thinking that something was going to happen to me.
    <br>I was going to die and these spirits always told me that I was going to die.
    <br>There were events also that happened to me where I almost died.
    <br>I had an encounter in my sister's house; we had a house robbery.
    <br>Armed robbers came into the house.
    <br>There were about six adult ladies there me included and three kids.
    <br>But out of all those people who were there, they just picked me.
    <br>They picked me, took me and said they were going to rape me.
    <br>Thank God they did not rape me because I fought back but in that process
    <br>that man assaulted me.
    <br>I was unconscious and in hospital for five days.
    <br>I knew that these spirits were after my life.
    <br>Since the deliverance, I have this peace inside of me.
    <br>Another thing that happened because these spirits
    <br>constantly talked to me, I had what we called a flight of ideas.
    <br>I couldn't keep my mouth shut because this thing continuously talked to me.
    <br>Everywhere you saw me, you would see me talking to people.
    <br>This thing troubled me because people knew me as a person
    <br>who talked too much and I did not like that.
    <br>After the deliverance, I found myself without anything to speak.
    <br>There is peace. I can sleep. I am just in tranquillity.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, this is an evidence of deliverance - lives changed.
    <br>We want to ask you right now:
    <br>Now, that you are delivered, set free, what is your advice to people of God,
    <br>especially those out there who used to patronize, people like the person you once were,
    <br>witch doctors, traditional healers, herbalists - what is your advice right now?
    <br>There are quite a few advices I have.
    <br>My first advice would be to Christians, like Prophet T.B. Joshua said,
    <br>if you want to be a Christian, be a Christian.
    <br>People of God, the only solution is in Jesus Christ.
    <br>There is no solution out there.
    <br>People who go to traditional doctors and herbalists, hear it from me,
    <br>there is no solution there.
    <br>You will finish your money.
    <br>At the end of the day, it will even eat up things that you did not get through them
    <br>because there are things that they would give you but they will eat those things
    <br>and even eat those that you did not get from them.
    <br>There is no solution through herbalists, traditional healers or witch doctors.
    <br>The only solution is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Olipha Dube
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ louder!
    <br>Indeed, Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life.
    <br>As our sister is talking, remember what Prophet T.B. Joshua said.
    <br>He said that when the devil gives you something with his right hand,
    <br>he gives you apparent peace, he would take something from you with his left hand,
    <br>something that your life depends on, and leave you worse than before.
    <br>We thank God for our sister's deliverance.
    <br>We want to encourage you, now you have been delivered by Christ's Word,
    <br>continue to be ruled by His Word and walk in the light of your testimony.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
