  <p>    
    <br>The action of the Holy Ghost still continued, as one by one God continued to release His power and promises
    <br>into the lives of the people receiving the ministration of the anointing water.
    <br>Watch how one of the principalities contrary to this purpose was disgraced, lost his grip and was cast out
    <br>of this young man.

    <br>Anointing Water Revival In The UK At The Troxy Theatre, London
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I don't have strength.
    <br>Do you know what just happened to you?
    <br>I could hear things but...
    <br>Do you know what you have just said?
    <br>No.
    <br>Jesus Christ has set you free from the demon that was tormenting your life.
    <br>Give glory to God!
    <br>I praise You, Father!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Well, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Our brother is coming forward right now to share his wonderful testimony, to the glory of God Almighty.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My brother, it is great to have you in our midst.
    <br>Please, introduce yourself to us.
    <br>Tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chris Jensen.
    <br>Originally I am from Sydney but I've been in Holland for the last two months.
    <br>You are very welcome, Chris.
    <br>Tell us first of all what were the problems that actually brought you to the Anointing Water Revival in London.
    <br>When I was 12 years old, I was clinically diagnosed with depression.
    <br>My parents sent me to many counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists for help but nothing helped me.
    <br>I was on medication since I was 12 years old.
    <br>I am 25 now.
    <br>Tell us how this depression really affected your life and things it caused you to do.
    <br>I got panic attacks, which are like anxiety attacks that came upon me.
    <br>In high school, I would have to leave the classroom.
    <br>I couldn’t study well, function or socialise.
    <br>I would isolate myself in my room in the last few years a lot.
    <br>I was struggling.
    <br>You used to stay alone in your room, just isolating yourself?
    <br>That is correct. Yes.
    <br>Anytime you try to move out with people and be around with people - what would happen?
    <br>How would this affect you?
    <br>If I was in public, like at a restaurant or somewhere in particular,
    <br>I would have to run out because I'd have an anxiety, panic attack.
    <br>I always felt troubled inside.
    <br>So, I could never socialise or talk much.
    <br>Tell us about your dreams at this period.
    <br>What were the types of things that were happening to you in your dreams?
    <br>Sometimes, I had dreams of hanging on a rope or suicidal thoughts of death.
    <br>I dreamt of coffins.
    <br>I always dreamt that I was falling in the sky – things like that.
    <br>Apart from these dreams, physically, what were the types of thoughts that used to go through your heart,
    <br>as a result of this severe depression?
    <br>When I saw a sharp object of any kind, like a knife in the kitchen, I would have a vision or an impression
    <br>in my mind that I was stabbing myself or someone near me.
    <br>So, anytime you saw sharp objects, something would tell you to stab yourself, or someone close to you?
    <br>That is correct.
    <br>How would you restrain yourself?
    <br>I looked to the Lord and to a verse in the Word and decided I would heed to it and not do it.
    <br>You mean that right from this young age you've had these suicidal thoughts,
    <br>as well as these dreams of death?
    <br>The suicidal thoughts, visions of death and nightmares had been more recent over the last five years
    <br>but since the age of 12, it's been mainly depression and panic attacks.
    <br>We can just understand our young brother here, what he has passed through in life as a result of this situation.
    <br>Tell us, where did you go to in search of solution, when this problem was at its worst?
    <br>That's interesting.
    <br>I went to Jesus most of all.
    <br>I went deeper in my relationship with the Lord.
    <br>I sought Him in prayer and fasting and read His Word for hours.
    <br>The counsellors could not help me; medication could not help me.
    <br>So, I was looking to the Lord for a breakthrough.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ for that faith.
    <br>In your search for deliverance; did this take you to anywhere else in the world - searching for this freedom?
    <br>That is right.
    <br>I went to Redding, California for a year to study but there was no breakthrough still, even after being there.
    <br>What did you study when you went there?
    <br>I went to the supernatural school of ministry that basically, gives you more identity in Christ
    <br>and how to walk in the things of the Spirit of God.
    <br>You even went to the Bible school, to try to draw closer to God, to get rid of this problem, but
    <br>even upon that, the problem was still there?
    <br>The problem was still there. Yes.
    <br>Well, we can just understand from our brother what he has really been passing through,
    <br>but we give glory to God that he is here, in our midst.
    <br>Tell us, how did you find out about the Anointing Water Revival and the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I have known about the ministry of T.B. Joshua for about five or six years.
    <br>How did you discover the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>I think it was through the internet on YouTube.
    <br>You were watching clips on YouTube and that's what has encouraged you
    <br>to come along to the Anointing Water Revival service?
    <br>That is right. Yes.
    <br>We just saw the clip of what happened.
    <br>Describe that experience.
    <br>Tell us exactly how you felt.
    <br>What happened when the anointing water was ministered to you.
    <br>That clip was new to me.
    <br>I had never seen that.
    <br>So, it is quite startling for me.
    <br>I don’t remember much of what happened to me but what I do recall is that when I was standing up there,
    <br>I felt quite nervous.
    <br>My teeth were cluttering together.
    <br>Then, all of a sudden, my hands felt like there was lighting, like electricity and this anger arose in me.
    <br>I can't recall what happened after that.
    <br>So, at that moment, what you saw just there...
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Chris Jenson
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>What you saw just there, with that demonic voice speaking through you; you have no recollection of it?
    <br>No.
    <br>This is truly a wonderful deliverance that our brother received.
    <br>Once again, what we saw was not him speaking; it was evil spirit within him that had been destroying his life
    <br>behind this terrible depression, that actually was exposed by the light of God in the anointing water.
    <br>Christ, it has been 3 weeks now since your deliverance.
    <br>Just testify - what has happened to your life since then?
    <br>I no longer have that torment.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>I've got peace.
    <br>The Prince of Peace is in my heart!
    <br>Chris Jenson
    <br>Anointing Water Testimony
    <br>A stable mind – Christ gives you the mind of His own.
    <br>So, you no longer have torment but peace – His peace.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Before you said you had this terrible nightmares, there was this voice pushing you to commit suicide.
    <br>Tell us, how has been your experience, since the deliverance.
    <br>I no longer have that torment.
    <br>It is a mind that is able to think properly.
    <br>I am able to move forward.
    <br>I have the capacity to move on now.
    <br>I feel that I can socialise much better and life is going to go from glory to glory.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hand together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>What about all those terrible suicidal thoughts; how have you been since the deliverance?
    <br>They had to go and they have definitely gone.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>So, you no longer have that thought to stab yourself or others, when you see sharp objects?
    <br>Absolutely now, no.
    <br>This is a wonderful testimony.
    <br>How have you been sleeping since then, Chris?
    <br>Perfectly, really well.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We believe you are in a really good position to advise people of God,
    <br>especially those here waiting for their own touch.
    <br>What do you want to advise them, firstly concerning this anointing water, and also concerning the problem
    <br>you were having, and how people can get out of it?
    <br>God is bigger than your problem.
    <br>No matter how narrow the way may seem to be for you, there is a solution;
    <br>Jesus is that solution and He is going to bring you through.
    <br>Last night, before I fell asleep, I saw our Lord, Jesus Christ on His throne with many crowns on His head.
    <br>I felt that He wanted you to know that He is above all principalities,
    <br>powers and dominions and He has the answer for you today. Amen!
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>What can you say about this anointing water, that God used to set you free?
    <br>If you read the Word of God, He used many mediums to anoint with power from on high.
    <br>The anointing water is a medium to deliver you, like Jesus, Himself delivered.
    <br>So, today you are going to receive your touch through the anointing water, through Jesus Christ.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>Lastly Chris, we know that the issue of depression, suicide is such a big problem all over the world...
    <br>You have gone through that, you have come out stronger, through Jesus Christ.
    <br>What is your advice for people out there who are going through the same problem you once had?
    <br>My advice would be that the Lord is bigger than all earthly means.
    <br>So, continue to look at the Lord, hold on to His Word and press through;
    <br>no matter what you are going through because Christ did it too.
    <br>Amen. One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
