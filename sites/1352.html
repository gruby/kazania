  <p>    
    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Emmanuel!" (God With  Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake and say, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!" (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>God is with us.
    <br>You are welcome once again to the presence of God
    <br>and you may have your seats in Jesus' name.
    <br>It is such a privilege to be in the presence of God
    <br>because here in the presence of God, healing, deliverance, breakthrough are just like breathing.
    <br>As you have entered into the presence of God today
    <br>and you are joining  us live on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>we know that your case will not escape the anointing of God.
    <br>So let me just quickly ask you a question.
    <br>You can answer the question from wherever you are in the church auditorium.
    <br>The question I want to ask you is this:
    <br>What are you here for today?
    <br>I want you to shout it out wherever your are: What are you here for today?
    <br>Ok, I'm hearing deliverance, salvation - very good.
    <br>Did someone say breakthrough?
    <br>Are sure you are here for breakthrough?
    <br>Ok. I heard someone say promotion.
    <br>Ok, now next question:
    <br>Who is the One who can give you these things? Let me hear you.
    <br>[Jesus!]
    <br>I'm not sure. Can you say that again.
    <br>[Jesus!]
    <br>Wonderful, you agree with me that what you are here for, Jesus is the One who will give you.
    <br>Excellent!
    <br>We know that whatever you receive here today will be from our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>through the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It is not man's plan; it is not by our own effort.
    <br>It is not by our human intelligence or wisdom.
    <br>It is by the grace of God that you will receive what you will receive today.
    <br>The Holy Spirit uses the Word of God to bring healing, to bring deliverance
    <br>to bring blessing, to bring peace into our hearts.
    <br>So, let me ask you the next question:
    <br>Is the Holy Spirit welcome into your heart?
    <br>I didn't hear you very clearly. Let me ask you again.
    <br>Is the Holy Spirit welcome in your heart?
    <br>Ok, we believe that yes is a genuine one.
    <br>Because I want to try and paint a picture that I believe can help you relate to this truth.
    <br>Just imagine that a very influential or important person is coming to visit you in your house.
    <br>Let's say maybe for example the president of your country or someone you know in society
    <br>that is very influential, someone that's very well known is coming to visit you in your house,
    <br>coming to eat with you.
    <br>Let me ask you this question. I want someone to answer.
    <br>How will you prepare your home to receive such a person?
    <br>If you would like to answer the question, just raise your hand.
    <br>Ok, our sister here has raised her hand.
    <br>I will clean up my house and put everything in place.
    <br>Ok, I hope you listened to what she said. She said she will clean up the house.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Clean up the house".
    <br>Ok, what else would you do?
    <br>I will make sure there is nothing on the ground, everything is fine.
    <br>Everything looks beautiful. Everything looks spick and span.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok. If you are going to prepare food for the influential person, what kind of food will you prepare?
    <br>The best food I like to eat.
    <br>The best food - ok, what is your best food?
    <br>Rice, baked beans and chicken.
    <br>The president is in for a very special dish.  Ok, what kind of rice?
    <br>Baked rice.
    <br>Wow! I hope you see where we are going here.
    <br>Our sister is saying the truth.
    <br>If you are going to receive a very important person into your house,
    <br>you will prepare very especially for that.
    <br>You will clean up everywhere. You will make sure that everywhere is beautiful.
    <br>You will make sure there is no dirt or things around. You want to make a good impression.
    <br>You want to impress the person that is coming to visit you. Is that not right?
    <br>You want to make sure the person is happy when they leave.
    <br>That they have a good impression about the visit to your house.
    <br>I want to relate this to the way and manner we often approach the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Today in our Christian lives, we often approach the Holy Spirit as a very special guest
    <br>that we want to welcome into our house for a short period and then He goes.
    <br>When we want to welcome Him, we quickly make sure we prepare everywhere.
    <br>We clean here, clean there, make sure this is fine.
    <br>We quickly stop anything that we know is not in line with Him,
    <br>because we want Him to come, we want to impress Him, we want to receive something from Him.
    <br>But let me tell you a valuable and an important truth today.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is not just here to visit your heart; He is here to make His home in your heart.
    <br>There is a difference - a visitor can come and go.
    <br>After the visitor has come, the mess that you cleared up, you can get messy again.
    <br>You say, "I have made a good impression, I have impressed my visitor".
    <br>But the Holy Spirit wants to make His home in your heart, to dwell in you,
    <br>to live in you permanently - not to come and go.
    <br>So I ask you the question again:
    <br>Is the Holy Spirit welcome in your heart?
    <br>Or do you just quickly clean up to impress Him?
    <br>Because you want healing, you want breakthrough, you want promotion,
    <br>you have a challenge that you are facing that is beyond you.
    <br>You say, "Let me run to church, I need this from God".
    <br>But you are just putting up an impression to try and woo the Holy Spirit to give you,
    <br>whereas you are not ready to really welcome Him to live in your heart.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says, the Holy Spirit may convict us, may operate through us.
    <br>He may speak through us but He cannot make His home in our heart unless we are recreated,
    <br>unless our hearts are conducive for Him to stay.
    <br>Many people today say they want the Holy Spirit to come,
    <br>they want the benefits, the results, the fruits of the Holy Spirit
    <br>but in  their private lives, behind closed doors, when they are back at home,
    <br>they still engage in things that grieve the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Holy Spirit goes where He is desired, not just where He is needed
    <br>because we all need the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Everyone needs Him; the question is: Do you really desire Him?
    <br>We need the Holy Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit, who are we?
    <br>Our Christian lives depend on the Holy Spirit.
    <br>No one can say no to sin and yes to righteousness without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>No on can say, "Jesus is Lord" effectively without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit, our church service today is just a religious occasion - just a gathering.
    <br>Without the help of the Holy Spirit, our prayers are just mere words.
    <br>Without the help of the Holy Spirit, we can fast and fast but we are just going on a hunger strike.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit, this message I'm preaching, this sermon is just a motivational talk.
    <br>It can inspire you, it can charge you emotionally but cannot change you spiritually.
    <br>You can only become spiritual by the help of the Holy Spirit
    <br>because God is Spirit and His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and in truth.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit, this Christianity that we claim is nothing more that religion -
    <br>serving a God we don't know.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>So I ask you again:
    <br>Is the Holy Spirit welcome to live in your heart?
    <br>The human spirit fails unless  the Holy Spirit fills.
    <br>And this brings us to the title of today's message:
    <br>WELCOME THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>Tell your neighbour: WELCOME THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>Now, let's quickly turn in our Bibles to the proof text for today's message.
    <br>That is Ephesians 4:30-32 and it reads thus:
    <br>"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
    <br>with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."
    <br>Verse 31.
    <br>"Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger, brawling and slander,
    <br>along with every form of malice.
    <br>Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other
    <br>just as in Christ God forgave you."
    <br>Now, let's quickly as well turn to the Book of Romans.
    <br>Romans 8:5-6.
    <br>And it reads thus:
    <br>"Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires;
    <br>but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their mind set on what the Spirit desires.
    <br>The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace."
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua says and he said this from his many experiences travelling
    <br>all over the world ministering to pastors, ministers, people in crusades all around the world.
    <br>He said that:
    <br>"I have witnessed the Holy Spirit descend on many people but He does not remain -
    <br>I mean, He does not stay when He is grieved."
    <br>How do we grieve the Holy Spirit?
    <br>I'm going to explain this to you in four very simple points,
    <br>and I encourage you to examine your life in the light of these truths.
    <br>How do we grieve the Holy Spirit?
    <br>Number 1: We grieve the Holy Spirit by our pride.
    <br>Number 2: We grieve the Holy Spirit when we hold a grudge against someone.
    <br>Number 3: We grieve the Holy Spirit when we ignore Him.
    <br>And number 4:
    <br>We grieve the Holy Spirit by forcing Him to see and hear what is opposed to His will.
    <br>I'm going to go through one by one with you.
    <br>Number 1: We grieve the Holy Spirit by our pride.
    <br>Pride. What is pride?
    <br>When you consider yourself more than God,
    <br>when you care more about your ego than your conscience,
    <br>when you care more about your image than your destiny,
    <br>when you care more about your ambition than your salvation.
    <br>Pride.
    <br>This pride is expressed in many ways. Let me just give you one or two ways which
    <br>you can identify someone that demonstrates that pride.
    <br>Have you observed that in life and in society in general
    <br>it is very common for people when they succeed and do well,
    <br>to attribute the glory to themselves
    <br>but when we fail, we look for a scapegoat.
    <br>When we fail, we point fingers.
    <br>We blame - "I'm from a bad family, poor family background,
    <br>this person is the one responsible for this I'm facing..."
    <br>We easily point fingers when we fail but when we do well, we attribute it to ourselves.
    <br>This is pride.
    <br>Pride causes you to view yourself as a victim.
    <br>Whenever you face a situation that is contrary to your expectation,
    <br>you begin to say, "Why are they treating me like this?
    <br>Why is it happening to me like this?
    <br>This guy - we were working together; he was promoted, not me.
    <br>Why me of all this, me, me?" Pride.
    <br>This pride grieves the Holy Spirit.
    <br>As a Christian, we should take our stand. Do you know what the stand of a Christian is?
    <br>As a Christian, we know that victory is not final and defeat is not fatal.
    <br>If we succeed today, we give glory to God because the best is yet to come;
    <br>if we fail today, we submit to God's will because the end has not yet come - that's a Christian.
    <br>It's so common for people today to attribute their success to themselves
    <br>whereas we know that we are who we are, where we are and what we are by God's grace.
    <br>Everything we have today comes from God.
    <br>All we are doing is simply giving back to Him what we have freely received from His generous hands.
    <br>It's all about Jesus.
    <br>But today another example of pride: you see people boasting about their material possessions,
    <br>boasting about the number of cars they have,
    <br>boasting about the amount of money in their bank accounts,
    <br>boasting about A, B, C, D
    <br>when the Bible says, the Spirit is greater than material possessions.
    <br>You see even - I'm sorry to say this - but even in the house of God today, pride is trying to infiltrate.
    <br>You see in some places, they celebrate the name of the pastor more than the name of Jesus,
    <br>building the brand of the ministry more than building the Kingdom of God.
    <br>We as part of this great commission have a wonderful example in the life of Prophet T.B.Joshua.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua said and I quote - I remember this so vividly -
    <br>he said, "The more God uses me, the more I humble myself because the work of healing is not mine,
    <br>the work of deliverance is not mine, the work of prophecy is not mine."
    <br>No man can claim credit for God's work.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't take the credit".
    <br>That is pride.
    <br>Pride hardens our hearts.
    <br>Pride masks the true condition of our hearts.
    <br>Pride clouds the eyes of our understanding.
    <br>Pride distorts our vision.
    <br>Pride keeps us from dealing with the truth.
    <br>Pride blinds us from reality.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because you begin to view yourself as a victim, pride easily leads to offence.
    <br>Someone embarrasses you, someone insults you, you say, "How can they do this to me?
    <br>How can they say this about me?"
    <br>Because of pride, we quickly pick offence and by so doing, we grieve the Holy Spirit.
    <br>I want to give a practical example of this.
    <br>If I can just have one volunteer; any volunteer if the Lord puts it in your heart, just come forward.
    <br>One volunteer. Ok, thank you very much, madam. God bless you.
    <br>Now, this a very simple example but I want you to examine your life in the light of this.
    <br>Madam, we are both Christians, we are brethren, we are colleagues in Christ
    <br>but I want you to do something; I want you to insult me, ok?
    <br>Don't worry, just for this example.
    <br>We are here together; I just want you to insult me and after you insult me, walk off.
    <br>You are stupid.
    <br>What?
    <br>Ok, now stop.
    <br>I hope you  follow the example now.
    <br>She is  a Christian, I'm a Christian. She just called me what?
    <br>She said, "You are stupid," and she walked off.
    <br>Now at this moment, if I have pride, do you know what I'm going to do?
    <br>I'm going to start looking at her - "How can this lady call me stupid?
    <br>What kind of nonsense is this? Does she not know who I am?
    <br>Are we not colleagues? What is the meaning of all this nonsense?"
    <br>As a result of pride, what happens? Offence steps in.
    <br>I hope you are with me.
    <br>Grudges step in, unforgiveness steps in, bitterness steps in
    <br>and your grudge grieves the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Do you know when you need the Holy Spirit?
    <br>When you are insulted, the Holy Spirit is there to comfort you
    <br>but today, we reject the comfort of the Comforter.
    <br>Today, we reject the help of the Helper by our grudge, our offence, our pride.
    <br>And when we reject the help of the Helper, what do we do?
    <br>We start looking for human help to make us feel better.
    <br>You go and meet someone and say, "Sir, do you know what that lady just called me?
    <br>What kind of nonsense is this? This is terrible. This is ridiculous".
    <br>And you are going to have sympathy on me.
    <br>Oh, we are sorry.
    <br>Do you know how many people have said, "We are sorry" to you?
    <br>And their sorry has not changed you.
    <br>We look for human sympathy, we quickly... we can call someone up and say,
    <br>"Ah, do you know that this woman, do you know what she just said to me? This is nonsense.
    <br>And we are friends. Do you know how she called me stupid in public?
    <br>What kind of nonsense is this?"
    <br>And the person will begin to say, "Haa, it's true; it's very bad.
    <br>"How can they say this to you? Sorry, hee hee".
    <br>And the person you are sharing the problem with cannot solve your problem.
    <br>In fact, the person you are sharing the problem with, often has the same problem as you
    <br>and you wonder why your problem does not go.
    <br>What we are doing by this offence -
    <br>we are rejecting the help of the Helper, we are rejecting the counsel of the Counsellor,
    <br>we are rejecting the comfort of the Comforter,
    <br>and we're on our own because we grieve the Holy Spirit,
    <br>the Holy Spirit that is there to comfort us, to provide for us, to guide us, to strengthen us
    <br>in those moments when we're insulted, embarrassed and tempted.
    <br>We grieve Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Check yourself".
    <br>Are you with me, people of God?
    <br>Now do you know the very painful thing about this?
    <br>Our sister here, whilst I'm busy nursing my grudge, nursing my bitterness, nursing my pain,
    <br>my sister here is also a Christian - do you know as she's left, you don't know what is going on in her heart.
    <br>The same Holy Spirit is convicting her, "That what you said is not right,
    <br>you are not supposed to use that kind of language".
    <br>And do you know that this same lady that night, whilst I'm busy in pain,
    <br>this same lady went on her knees and reconciled with God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now imagine the scenario.
    <br>The person that offended me is free and me that was offended is in bondage.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, let me continue.
    <br>Madam, you are going to come back; I'm still busy nursing my wound.
    <br>You are going to meet me, come back and just say, "I'm sorry," greet me and walk off.
    <br>And I want you to see how many of us react. Ok, come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>- Good morning.
    <br>- Good morning.
    <br>I am very sorry about what I said to you the other day and I apologise.
    <br>It comes sincere from my heart.
    <br>- Ok.
    <br>- I'm very sorry about that.
    <br>No problem.
    <br>Now, she is going to turn away. I want you to look at me.
    <br>Ok, go ahead.
    <br>- Please forgive me.
    <br>- I have forgiven you; no problem, go ahead.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I hope you are following me.
    <br>You say, "I have forgiven you, go ahead". In your heart - "You stupid woman!
    <br>Do you call this an apology? What kind of nonsense is this?"
    <br>And she is free. She is continuing her journey. Nothing is disturbing her heart.
    <br>She is the one that insulted you, but she is free because she didn't grieve the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit prompted her conscience to repent, she repented.
    <br>But you that was insulted, you are in a chamber of bondage.
    <br>You've rejected the help of the Helper when you needed His help the most.
    <br>You rejected the comfort of the Comforter when you needed His comfort.
    <br>That is why we start going to look for comfort in the world, to look for comfort from friends,
    <br>to look for help from people with good intentions who can provide human sympathy, human pity
    <br>but no amount of human sympathy has changed you; no amount of human pity has changed you.
    <br>Only the Holy Spirit can change you and we grieve Him.
    <br>Thank you very much. Let's clap for our mother here.
    <br>A wonderful insult.
    <br>Just grab an altar fruit by the grace of God and you can go back to your seat.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Wow! Just because of "you're stupid", see what she is enjoying. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>In this world, there will be disturbance.
    <br>If you want to be in a place where nothing will disturb you, you will reach Heaven.
    <br>In this world, people will insult you, embarrass you, falsely accuse you.
    <br>You will face... look, I just used the example of insult.
    <br>You can use your own scenario and insert it into this example.
    <br>Perhaps you are facing barreness, perhaps there are marital challenges,
    <br>perhaps there is lack of promotion at your work place,
    <br>perhaps people hate you for no just cause.
    <br>We all have a situation.
    <br>Something pokes us, something prods us, something hits us - that's this life!
    <br>In fact, that's the beauty of our journey into eternity.
    <br>It is these things that help us to realise how much we need God.
    <br>Today, when we are tempted, when we are tested, when we are troubled,
    <br>the Holy Spirit that Jesus sent to comfort us is the same Helper that we reject
    <br>because we grieve the Holy Spirit by our pride, by holding a grudge against someone.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is there to comfort you with the Words of God; He is there.
    <br>And I remember Prophet T.B.Joshua saying something that touched me so much.
    <br>He said this and I quote:
    <br>"There is nothing I cannot overlook for the sake of Jesus."
    <br>I want to ask you to examine yourself.
    <br>What are you facing in this life that Jesus Himself did not face?
    <br>Jesus said, a servant cannot be greater than a master,
    <br>if the world hated me, they will hate you also.
    <br>Are you being hated? Are you being falsely accused?
    <br>Jesus Christ was called the king of demons.
    <br>Have you been betrayed? Jesus Christ was betrayed by His disciple.
    <br>Have you been persecuted?
    <br>Jesus Christ was nailed to the Cross of Calvary and He said, "Father, forgive them".
    <br>But, today, just a little poke, you hold offence.
    <br>Just a little prod, you say, "Why me?"
    <br>Just a little hit, you say, "Why is God allowing this to happen to me?"
    <br>By so doing, we grieve the Holy Spirit
    <br>I ask the question again:
    <br>Is the Holy Spirit welcome in your heart?
    <br>The Holy Spirit cannot share a heart that is full of offence.
    <br>He cannot share a heart that is full of unforgiveness, pain of the past, bitterness, grief.
    <br>He will not force Himself on you.
    <br>If He sees the place that He is supposed to be is not conducive,
    <br>He will leave and you are on your own.
    <br>That's number 2: the way we grieve the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Number 3: We grieve the Holy Spirit when we ignore Him.
    <br>Let me just give a capital example of how we ignore the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Today, it is common for people to pick their Bible and quickly start reading it
    <br>without seeking the attention of the Holy Spirit
    <br>when this Bible we are seeing was inspired by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>For you to read the Bible effectively, you must be carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Jesus said His Word is Spirit and life.
    <br>Reading the Bible without the Holy Spirit is just reading literature, history, reading about events
    <br>This is why the Bible makes no meaning to us.
    <br>We can quote Scripture but our lives don't seem to quote the evidence of Scripture.
    <br>We grieve Him when we take our Bible and read without involving the Holy Spirit,
    <br>without asking for His help, seeking His attention.
    <br>"Holy Spirit, take more of me and give me more of You."
    <br>You can't read this Bible unless the Holy Spirit helps you to understand.
    <br>We grieve the Holy Spirit when we ignore Him.
    <br>Number 4:
    <br>We grieve the Holy Spirit when we force Him to see and hear what is opposed to His will.
    <br>This is affecting almost every one of us today, especially the younger generation.
    <br>Today, we are so often exposed to things that are contrary to God.
    <br>We watch lustful things, dirty things, abominable things
    <br>and the Bible says that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>1 Corinthians 6:19-20.
    <br>Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and you want the Holy Spirit to dwell, to live in you.
    <br>You sit down and watch things on television, on the internet, read things in books, listen to music
    <br>that is contrary to the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You grieve Him; you want to force Him to see what is opposed to His will,
    <br>watching things that promote lust, fornication, hatred, violence.
    <br>You may say, "It's not affecting me, I'm just watching it to pass my time".
    <br>A Christian must be careful of what he sees because what he sees influences his thoughts.
    <br>I'm sure you can relate with this; many times you have watched something just once
    <br>but you can replay what you have watched a thousand times in your mind.
    <br>I remember when I was a young boy, around nine or ten years old,
    <br>I accidentally walked into a room where they were playing a horror film - disgusting.
    <br>I just saw that clip for 2 minutes, and I left.
    <br>I had nightmares for 2 months.
    <br>When I closed my eyes, I was re-watching what I saw in those 2 minutes.
    <br>I just saw it once, I didn't mean to go there.
    <br>I just came in, adults in the room were watching this.
    <br>I am not supposed to be there as a young boy.
    <br>I saw it, I quickly left but what I saw affected my heart.
    <br>You can just watch pornography and replay what you have watched a 100 times in your head
    <br>and you are grieving the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Think about our young generation today.
    <br>Parents here - examine what your children are exposed to.
    <br>Today, it's so easy with the accessibility of technology and the internet
    <br>You find people at a young age exposed to things that are immoral,
    <br>exposed to things that are corrupt, exposed to things that are dirty,
    <br>and we want the Holy Spirit to live in us.
    <br>The Holy Spirit cannot dwell in a dirty place.
    <br>Our children are playing video games where they are shooting each other
    <br>and you wonder why they have violent tendencies.
    <br>Our children are watching films and movies and soap operas where they celebrate lust
    <br>and they think it's normal for there to be sexual immorality
    <br>and you wonder why at a young age,
    <br>you see young people begin to go into all kinds of stupid and nonsensical things
    <br>because they are watching things, reading things, listening to music
    <br>that's contrary to God and we grieve the Holy Spirit.
    <br>1 John 2:16.
    <br>Are you with me, people of God?
    <br>That's why when I ask that question, "Is the Holy Spirit welcome in your heart?",
    <br>the question is pregnant.
    <br>You need to examine yourself in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Perhaps 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the areas I have spoken of today may relate with you.
    <br>The truth is, as you're here in church today, coming to receive something from God,
    <br>you cannot make spiritual progress on the platform of pretence.
    <br>You are here, you want to impress God, impress the Holy Spirit into releasing what you here for,
    <br>but in your private life, behind closed doors, when you are back home, you are still grieving the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You cannot deceive God.
    <br>God knows you better than you know yourself.
    <br>Do you know how you can know when you grieve the Holy Spirit?
    <br>You can now when there is absence of peace; everyone here can identify with this.
    <br>You know when you take an action that steals your peace.
    <br>You can run away from God with riches and wealth
    <br>but you cannot run away with peace of heart.
    <br>Peace!
    <br>Why can't we strive and struggle for peace?
    <br>When there is peace of heart, there is no need for division, fighting, conflict, envy and jealousy.
    <br>What is the cause of all of the challenges so many of us are facing today?
    <br>We are not content. You have A, you want B, you have B, you want C,
    <br>you have C, you want D, you have D, you want E.
    <br>When will you stop wanting? We are not content.
    <br>Little things, we compare ourselves with others; little things, we judge ourselves by others.
    <br>Little things, we measure ourselves by ourselves
    <br>because we are not content; we don't have peace.
    <br>And the Holy Spirit is the Giver of peace.
    <br>We reject the peace of the Peace-Giver when we harbour offence in our heart.
    <br>We reject the joy of the Joy-Giver when we are prideful.
    <br>We reject the guidance of the Roadmap when we ignore Him.
    <br>We reject the strength of our Strengthener when we watch things intentionally
    <br>that are contrary to His will.
    <br>So brethren, in conclusion:
    <br>Don't grieve the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't grieve the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Holy Spirit wants to be the Lord of your life.
    <br>He wants to possess you entirely
    <br>so that you are no longer in control of this little vessel in which you sail.
    <br>You are a passenger, you can be a crew member but you are not in charge.
    <br>You are not in control.
    <br>Put the Holy Spirit in charge; put the Holy Spirit in control.
    <br>When you welcome the Holy Spirit into your heart, you begin to think differently, dream differently,
    <br>you begin to have a sensitivity you never had before.
    <br>You will have the privilege of letting the Creator of Heaven and earth assist you in all you do.
    <br>And I pray that this Word finds a place in your heart today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts.
