  <p>    
    <br>You need to know who you are.
    <br>I am a spirit; you are a spirit living in a physical body, learning to live in the natural world.
    <br>I listen to my spirit because it is controlled by the Holy Spirit
    <br>for I walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.
    <br>I examine my leading in the light of God's Word.
    <br>So, you must know who you are.
    <br>Open your lips and confess this with me.
    <br>I am a spirit living in a physical body, 
    <br>learning to live in the natural world.
    <br>I listen to the voice of my spirit because it is controlled by the Holy Spirit
    <br>for I walk not after the flesh but after the spirit.
    <br>I examine my leading in the light of God's Word, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you are there.
    <br>You are a spirit; we only live in the physical body.
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>In Jesus Chist's name, we pray.
    <br>Whatever way you have been imprisoned by demons and evil spirits,
    <br>right now, you are declared free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips: Whatever way you have been caged and imprisoned financially, health-wise,
    <br>physically and spiritually, right now, be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to release yourself.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I command that affliction, out!
    <br>Out of your body - that sickness, disease!
    <br>Command them out!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are right now, I say to the sickness and disease, leave my people!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, leave my people!
    <br>Wherever it is located, in your blood, bones, tendons,
    <br>you sickness, disease and affliction, leave my people!
    <br>You are declared free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
