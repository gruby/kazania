  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I know your faith is lifted up.
    <br>There never has been and there never will be another person quite like you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There never has been and there never will be another person quite like you".
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again,
    <br>"There never has been and there never will be another person quite like you".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>There never has been and there never will be another person quite like you.
    <br>That is why you are here today.
    <br>Your faith needs to be tested.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Your mission and your vision need to be tested.
    <br>You know, for so long you have been planning to come here.
    <br>Many have been planning to come here but something happened that will hold them down,
    <br>but here you are today.
    <br>There never has been and there never will be another person quite like you.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because you are wired.
    <br>MAKE JESUS YOUR BOSS!!! | TB Joshua Short Sermon
    <br>You are what?
    <br>[Wired.]
    <br>You know, to wire something is not to 'quack' people.
    <br>When a thing is wired properly, you are wired in a very unique way.
    <br>In a very what?
    <br>[Unique way.]
    <br>... by the Creator of everything.
    <br>It is not a human being that wired you - the Creator of everything...
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am wired in a very unique way by the Creator of everything".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I am wired in a very unique way by the Creator of everything.]
    <br>Nothing can disconnect you.
    <br>Can poverty?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Affliction?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Trouble?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Pain?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Sickness?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Nothing can disconnect me because I am wired in a very unique way by the Creator of everything".
    <br>MAKE JESUS YOUR BOSS!!! | TB Joshua Short Sermon
    <br>Paul said, "Nothing..."
    <br>Can poverty, calamity, affliction, humiliation?
    <br>He said, "Nothing ..." because he was wired. So also you are wired.
    <br>Your trouble will prepare you for extraordinary service.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>When you make the Lord your boss, CEO, director of all you do, you are wired.
    <br>You become connected.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You become connected when you give your life to Jesus
    <br>and make Him your director, CEO, boss of all you do".
    <br>You become connected to the One who created you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>If you are distant to your Lord, or you want to rededicate yourself, rise up.
    <br>Let me lead you.
    <br>Let me usher you to the connection.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You can ask Jesus Christ right now to be the Lord of your life.
    <br>It is quite simple.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul today.
    <br>My Saviour, thank You for my salvation.
    <br>My Redeemer, thank You for my redemption.
    <br>My Healer, thank You for my healing.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
