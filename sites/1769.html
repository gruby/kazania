    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>During the Pastors' Conference with Prophet T.B. Joshua in the nation of the Dominican Republic,
    <br>he gave messages of prophecy concerning individuals that revealed the root causes of their problems.
    <br>Let's listen to one of the prophecies.
    <br>There is a woman there who will be going for an operation this week.

    <br>She has been booked for the operation three times but she tried to avoid it.

    <br>Please, come out; I want to counsel you.
    <br>You will still go back to the operation; it will come out successfully and nothing will happen.
    <br>God will lead the doctor to do it.
    <br>Prophecy Time At The Pastors' Conference In The Dominican Republic With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The person concerned comes out to confirm the prophecy.
    <br>My name is Rosanna, I come from Miami.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy from the man of God.
    <br>Three times, I avoided to confirm the surgery for uterine fibroids.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Good Morning, church!
    <br>My name is Rosanna Marte and I come from the United States.
    <br>I connected, by God's invitation, with Emmanuel TV in July 2016.
    <br>Ever since then, with every preaching, the Word of God changed my heart
    <br>through the preaching of the man of God, T.B. Joshua.
    <br>As I continued to connect throughout the next two years, I experienced the deliverance process,
    <br>one day at a time.
    <br>During those two years, I was diagnosed with uterine fibroids.
    <br>The fibroids were diagnosed as the size of my head.
    <br>During that time I went to the emergency room with severe abdominal pain.
    <br>I was seeking a solution to the problem that caused the abdominal pain.
    <br>The problem was exposed through the diagnosis of the doctor in the emergency room.
    <br>I was seeking God, because the man of God always preaches that every crisis takes us closer to God,
    <br>and that crisis took me closer to God.
    <br>I sought God more and connected more with Emmanuel TV, praying and seeking deliverance.
    <br>But it seemed that God was going to use another means of divine intervention.
    <br>I was continuing to experience much pain
    <br>and the fibroid was so big that it was putting pressure on my bladder.
    <br>This meant I had to go to the bathroom continuously, at all hours of day, interrupting my work.
    <br>At times, I tried to ignore the pain I was experiencing and not complain about it.
    <br>I consulted doctors and visited them, but I knew my divine intervention was going to come from God.
    <br>But I was diligent with the doctor, who told me I had to do surgery or else the fibroid would grow even more,
    <br>and I could lose my uterus.
    <br>At that point I became desperate, praying that something had to happen quickly.
    <br>It was then that I heard through Emmanuel TV that the man of God T.B. Joshua was going to hold a crusade
    <br>in the Dominican Republic in November 2017.
    <br>I felt compelled, I was seeking the Word of God, I needed to know if it was to be surgery,
    <br>or if He was just going to heal me through deliverance and a prophetic word.
    <br>I travelled from the US to the Dominican Republic in November 2017 seeking something from God.
    <br>When I was there, on the third day, God was so faithful.
    <br>There were very few prophecies and within those few, I was the first one, because God is faithful.
    <br>I am here today because of God's invitation, and God invited me to the Dominican Republic.
    <br>He opened the door for me to go there so that He could use the man of God T.B. Joshua
    <br>to bring me the confirmation, so that when I returned home to the US after receiving the prophetic word,
    <br>I immediately went to the doctor, because God was going to use the doctor,
    <br>according to the prophecy, to heal me.
    <br>In February 2018 I had surgery, and it was successful, glory be to God, just as the prophecy had said.
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Can you tell us once again, what was the prophecy that the man of God gave to you?
    <br>The prophecy was that there was a woman who had cancelled surgery on several occasions.
    <br>I cancelled it personally because I was afraid and I was seeking God -
    <br>I didn't know if the surgery was going to have repercussions.
    <br>I just wanted to obey the Word of God, because I knew He could heal me,
    <br>whether through a doctor or just supernaturally dissolving the fibroid.
    <br>I was seeking that confirmation and when he confirmed  that the surgery was going to be successful,
    <br>that God promised to use the doctors to bring a divine intervention,
    <br>that was when I understood that God was going to use the doctors
    <br>and when I returned to the US I could confirm the surgery.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>God is faithful.
    <br>I was just tormented by the decision.
    <br>I know that I serve a real, powerful, supernatural God
    <br>and I was asking Him to show me the root of the problem so He could provide the solution.
    <br>I knew the challenge would bring me closer to Him.
    <br>During this time I was tormented and confused, seeking an answer everywhere.
    <br>I was seeking through my Quiet Time with the Word of God, through connecting with Emmanuel TV
    <br>and when I received this prophecy, it was overwhelming for me.
    <br>I had been overwhelmed by torment, which was not from God, and God delivered me from that torment
    <br>and brought me to a peace, knowing that He is with me.
    <br>So this prophetic word delivered me; the prophetic word delivers and that's what this prophecy did for my life.
    <br>Hallelujah, put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
    <br>So you went back to the US and you had the operation and it was successful to the glory of God.
    <br>Now tell us, was your uterus removed?
    <br>No, I have my uterus;
    <br>it was saved, glory be to God, just as the prophecy confirmed that the surgery was going to be successful
    <br>and He was going to lead the doctor.
    <br>Thank you very much; we can see some pictures on the board.
    <br>Do you want to tell us what these pictures are?
    <br>This is my uterus.
    <br>TB Joshua Counsels Lady To Do OPERATION | "GOD Will Lead The Doctors!!!"
    <br>God was so graceful that they didn't even have to open my stomach; it was a robotic surgery.
    <br>This is my uterus and this is the doctor opening my uterus and this is the fibroid.
    <br>This is the fibroid being removed from my uterus.
    <br>It was bigger than that - that is just half of the fibroid.
    <br>And this is my uterus saved and sewed back together after removing the fibroid, glory be to God.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Challenges bring you closer to God.
    <br>Challenges in the life of a Christian are to bring you closer to Him, to seek Him, to know Him,
    <br>to understand that His heart is to bless us and for us to walk in deliverance and blessing.
    <br>Deliverance is the bread of the children of God, for us to walk in that deliverance.
    <br>Whether the deliverance comes through a doctor with surgery, or through a prophetic word, or through prayer,
    <br>that is God working in your heart.
    <br>It is an encounter with your heart; I realised during this time that it is an issue of the heart.
    <br>God transformed and healed my heart and brought my heart closer, because my heart is the prayer room.
    <br>When my heart is troubled, that can bring problems to my relationship with God.
    <br>I tell any woman who has an issue of the heart, or an issue like fibroids, seek God because He's your Father.
    <br>Glory be to God, the challenge is so you can seek Him and know.
    <br>I am here today to testify of His name, that He is real today, yesterday and forever.
    <br>Thank you very much for that wonderful advice.
    <br>We also want to advise you that as God Almighty has delivered you through His Word,
    <br>through that prophecy, you should go and make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Remember, using the Word of God that you have read, at all times, helps you to ensure that your prayer
    <br>is in line with God's will and intention for your life.
    <br>So, make sure you make God's Word the standard for your life and it shall be well with you, in Jesus' name.
