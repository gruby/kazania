    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>You are captured for the glory of God.
    <br>My nation, receive salvation - economic salvation, political salvation.
    <br>Lord Jesus, thank You, Lord!
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>When I say, "Give thanks to God", I know what God is doing in your life.
    <br>Let me tell you something: I know before you.
    <br>When you are healed, I know before you.
    <br>The prophets in the Bible - that is the gift - before you know you are healed, they know.
    <br>They will be the one to say, "You are healed. Check yourself".
    <br>Before you now say, "Uh? Check myself?".
    <br>"I'm healed!"
    <br>I say give thanks to God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>If I say, "Give thanks to God", what does that mean?
    <br>The meaning is: I know you are delivered!
    <br>See what happened when Jesus said to His disciples, "Something came out of Me".
    <br>Even the woman didn't know that her blood had dried up.
    <br>It was when Jesus said to His disciples,
    <br>"Locate her. The woman touched the hem of my garment and something came out of Me".
    <br>They started looking for the woman.
    <br>"Are you the one?".
    <br>"Yes, I am the one. Oh, I'm healed!".
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>We can't wait to hear your testimony.
    <br>Remember the message today: The Holy Spirit is the Maintainer.
    <br>Whatever you have - your career, your life - cannot be maintained except by the help of Who? [The Holy Spirit].
    <br>That is why we are up and down today.
    <br>People are selling their property,
    <br>a lot of has happened,
    <br>from one position to another,
    <br>good yesterday, bad today - because of lack of maintenance.
    <br>You cannot maintain it.
    <br>So now, for our maintenance, let us commit ourselves to God, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Open your lips. Right now, say after me:
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me Your channel - Your channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me Your channel - Your channel of love where there is hate.
    <br>Make me Your channel, Lord - Your channel of pardon where there is injury.
    <br>Make me Your channel, Lord - Your channel of forgiveness where there is wrong, sin.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for dying in my place.
    <br>Thank You for Your salvation, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>I can't hear your 'Amen'.
    <br>Now, you need to ask yourself: Am I a channel of love? Because out there is hatred.
    <br>Am I now a channel of shining light? Out there is darkness.
    <br>Am I now a channel of forgiveness? Out there is wrong, mistakes, sin.
    <br>If so, you are God's representative.
    <br>Ask yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Ask yourself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Here I am send me.
    <br>If the Lord wants somebody here I am send me
    <br>Here I am send me.
    <br>If the Lord wants somebody here I am send me
    <br>Thank You, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Hallelujah!
