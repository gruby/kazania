    <br>EMMANUEL TV DISASTER RELIEF
    <br>On the 23rd of March, 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa
    <br>announced a new measure to combat the spread of virus,
    <br>also known in South Africa:
    <br>a five-week nationwide lockdown with severe restrictions on travel and movement,
    <br>supported by the South African National Defence Force,
    <br>from midnight, the 26th of March, to midnight, 30th of April.
    <br>With lockdown, national borders were closed, social distancing was introduced, and meant:
    <br>no more gatherings, no more church meetings, and no more school.
    <br>The lockdown is one of the factors for South Africa's downgrade to junk status.
    <br>The Reserve Bank predicted that many businesses will close
    <br>and there will be one million job losses due to the virus.
    <br>South African Airways, the national carrier, has suspended all regional and international routes
    <br>until the 31st of May, 2020, in response to the South African government's travel ban.
    <br>Gender-based violence rose dramatically as 87,000-plus cases were made in the first week of lockdown
    <br>with women and girls being terrorized inside their homes.
    <br>Dozens of schools have been burgled, trashed or burnt to the ground.
    <br>After lockdown, thousands of children will have no school to return to,
    <br>depriving them of the right to education.
    <br>Eskom, the parastatal power company, reported an increase in cable theft and vandalism,
    <br>resulting in power supply interruptions and damage that will cost millions to repay.
    <br>Public property is being vandalized, while the entire country experiences hardship.
    <br>The masses fear that starvation will kill them, and not the virus.
    <br>The situation is dire with the ripple effect of prolonged poverty, unemployment, and even starvation
    <br>in the brittle economy, whether individuals or families in self-isolation or the homeless
    <br>forced into makeshift shelters in stadiums.
    <br>Fear is everywhere.
    <br>TB JOSHUA'S MESSAGE TO SOUTH AFRICA DURING VIRUS LOCKDOWN!
    <br>Good morning, viewers! As you can see, the Emmanuel TV team are shopping at one of the biggest bulk retailers
    <br>in South Africa this morning, as rows of trolleys are being pushed to the checkout pay point.
    <br>The nation is in crisis and disaster relief is necessary.
    <br>In this time of lockdown, vulnerable people like the aged cannot travel to buy groceries.
    <br>Many cannot earn an income anymore as whole industries have shut down
    <br>and the masses are helpless to provide for themselves in these dire circumstances.
    <br>The task is enormous.
    <br>That's why we are here today on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Let your seed move your faith, and your faith will move God.
    <br>Having met with some of the charities, old-age facilities, and shelters, a shopping list of food, clothing, bedding,
    <br>personal items, and household items was made to fulfil specific needs.
    <br>The bulk purchase meant that this retailer
    <br>assigned a dedicated shopping team to assist us with sourcing groceries
    <br>like rice, canned vegetables, maize meal, milk, sugar, canned meat,
    <br>oats, pastas, soups, and various condiments.
    <br>The clothing includes men's and women's long-sleeved jackets to keep warm,
    <br>shoes, underwear, and baby clothes.
    <br>The bedding includes 60 blankets and 60 pillows.
    <br>Personal items include soaps, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and towels.
    <br>And the household items include sanitizers, dish washing liquid, bleaches and disinfectants.
    <br>You can see the large box deep freezers, fridges, and a stove are being loaded on the Emmanuel TV truck.
    <br>At the end of an eight-hour shopping day, two of the Emmanuel TV eight-ton trucks were loaded.
    <br>Emmanuel TV South Africa Outreach To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>We queued at a farmer's market for the popular fresh produce of vegetables like
    <br>cabbages, potatoes, onions and carrots, as well as seasonal fresh fruit like apples, bananas and oranges.
    <br>Emmanuel TV South Africa Outreach To The Needy During Lockdown
    <br>These trucks are being unloaded at the storehouse and items are grouped so that they can be divided
    <br>for the various charities, shelters, and old-age homes.
    <br>Fourteen mattresses, 60 blankets, and 60 pillows have been purchased for the homeless.
    <br>You can see the Emmanuel TV team picking and packing hampers as well as grouping
    <br>large items like the fresh vegetables and fruits,
    <br>while others are sorting products for packing.
    <br>God has called us to the Kingdom for a time such as this.
    <br>What special grace in an unprecedented time like this, that Emmanuel TV can bring
    <br>God's assurance with messages of love and hope, countering fear!
    <br>When you give, you are planting seeds that will be multiplied back to you a hundredfold.
    <br>We arrived at the gate and the manager explained that all old-age homes
    <br>have now gone into an absolute lockdown:
    <br>no coming in or going out, not even for essential items.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua is often quoted:
    <br>"Where are your elderly?
    <br>Look after them and you will reach old age."
    <br>We have 95 residents in this old-age home. Each and every person here will get three hampers.
    <br>The hampers contain sugar, flour, rice, maize meal, samp, pastas, milk powder, cooking oil, salt,
    <br>tomato sauce, tinned fish, tinned beans, tinned meat, mayonnaise, large jam, large peanut butter,
    <br>soups, toothpaste, household cleaning products like: disinfectants, dish washing liquid, soaps,
    <br>washing powder,  and clothing softener.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team has packed 285 hampers for this old-age home,
    <br>and this is being unloaded and packed in front of the elderly.
    <br>As you can see, they've all come out to see what is happening.
    <br>This is totally unexpected.
    <br>Besides the three hampers per person, fresh fruit like bananas, apples, and oranges
    <br>as well as vegetables, have also been supplied in bulk.
    <br>As the Emmanuel TV van is being offloaded, the joy and gratitude is almost tangible.
    <br>We are standing here at the residential old-age home with the manager, Mr. Nick van Staden.
    <br>We take care of the elderly. We've got about 95 residents at this site at this stage and
    <br>our main priority is to look after them, their health and everything.
    <br>We are one of the fourteen old-age homes in the group of homes that stretches as far as The Cape.
    <br>I think you are doing an amazing job for the community. Thank you.
    <br>At first I thought it wasn't going to be so bad, but now that we are deeper into the lockdown, I find that
    <br>emotionally, it really affects me because we do not have the companionship of our community.
    <br>We can just say "hello" and "goodbye", but we cannot speak to each other or enjoy a cup of tea together
    <br>and because I don't have family support, I really really miss this and I get very lonely.
    <br>And so, what you are doing for us is absolutely outstanding.
    <br>I can tell you that I feel loved and I feel that God is taking care of us from Above through you.
    <br>And therefore, my gratitude can never never be enough.
    <br>In my 74 years of being on Planet Earth,
    <br>I have never ever seen something like this, and I thank you, Prophet Joshua,
    <br>because you are in God's hands and you are His instrument to give us a joyful day,
    <br>especially being the Easter weekend, where Jesus gave His all.
    <br>You came and you gave to us what you have. Thank you. Thank you very much.
    <br>I want to thank T.B. Joshua, the prophet, for what he is doing for us.
    <br>It means a lot to us, especially to me, who's been watching him for many many years on TV.
    <br>I cannot express the gratitude that I feel for the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>and T.B. Joshua, the prophet, for what he is doing for us.
    <br>I am astonished and without words. It is amazing and God bless you.
    <br>ItÂ´s fantastic.
    <br>Thank you very much. This was totally unexpected. Seriously, thank you very much.
    <br>You are truly amazing doing things. God is good. He is our Provider.
    <br>Thank you so much. You are wonderful people.
    <br>You must know that, whatever you are giving, what we give is not as important as the way we give it.
    <br>The humble home of the three founding sisters in Johannesburg caters to the homeless.
    <br>Their heart and soul is in their feeding ministry for the past 20 years.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV truck arrived and the team unpacked the bulk groceries:
    <br>50 kg maize meal, 40 kg rice, 30 kg samp,
    <br>pastas, salt, tomato sauce, vinegar, mayonnaise, and juice.
    <br>The fresh vegetables included carrots, spinach, potatoes, sweet potatoes, green beans, and cabbage.
    <br>The seasonal fruits are oranges, apples, and pears.
    <br>No sooner have we arrived, and the homeless queue for a hearty meal.
    <br>This five-star meal is served every Sunday.
    <br>The children line up first, then adults.
    <br>I'm looking at this queue; it extends all the way down the street and around the block.
    <br>I think about 400 people are here!
    <br>We are here today in Johannesburg by The Mount Like Eagles Mission.
    <br>I'm standing here with the three founders of the Mount Like Eagles.
    <br>Madams, can you tell us more about what Mount Like Eagles Mission is all about?
    <br>We started this 20 years ago. My main aim was on the destitute, the homeless.
    <br>That was our passion because we saw how things are here in the south of Johannesburg.
    <br>Nobody has done that for us in these 20 years. Everything came out of our own pocket.
    <br>Sometimes we sell clothes on a Saturday just to sustain their needs on a Sunday
    <br>because we believe that what we're eating, we need to give back to them.
    <br>Even when you eat, you always think, even in your prayer, about the one that does not have.
    <br>I think I'm starting to get emotional because I can see the Lord in it.
    <br>This morning, He remembered Mount Like Eagles Mission!
    <br>I never thought this could happen because we did this for all these years on our own.
    <br>It was not really on our own but on behalf of the Lord, but we fully and faithfully trust in the Lord.
    <br>Whether we have or we don't have, these people are dependent on a decent meal
    <br>and we're going to cook for them.
    <br>And now this is just mind-blowing. It's just amazing!
    <br>As the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua teaches us:
    <br>the beauty of life does not depend on how happy you are, but on how happy others are because of you.
    <br>So when we told him about you, he said that he wants to give even more.
    <br>God laid it on his heart to even do more.
    <br>So he sent us, he commissioned us to go and get you grocery vouchers up to the value of 50,000 Rand.
    <br>Oh, what shall we say? I thank the Lord; I see Him in this, it's not man, I just thank Him.
    <br>Thank you, prophet.
    <br>May the Lord grant you more and more and release an awesome fresh anointing upon your life.
    <br>Thank you, thank you so much.
    <br>I want to thank Emmanuel TV for the food parcel I received.
    <br>We really appreciate it. Thank you very much.
    <br>I would like to say, "Thank you!"
    <br>My name is Charles and this is my fiancÃ©e, Heather; she is a pensioner.
    <br>We've been struggling a lot;  we've been going through a rough time.
    <br>I just started working a few weeks before the virus outbreak and the 21-day shut down.
    <br>We went without food.
    <br>Thank you very much!
    <br>God bless you!
    <br>May you keep up the good work.
    <br>Thank you very much!
    <br>The House Group is a safe house for underage girls who have been abused.
    <br>Many are refugees.
    <br>Their identities are protected for their safety, as recently they had to relocate under threat
    <br>and consequently left most of their belongings behind.
    <br>We arrived early in the morning with a police escort and the Emmanuel TV eight-ton truck.
    <br>Because of the extreme importance of no gatherings in lockdown,
    <br>we had to unpack and leave as soon as possible under the supervision of the South African Police Force.
    <br>Their list includes canned products like fish, meat, vegetables, sweetcorn, beans, and fruit.
    <br>Beverages include coffee, tea, juices, Milo, and hot chocolate.
    <br>Condiments here are spices, sauces, mayonnaise, and vinegar.
    <br>The general groceries include the basic foodstuffs like milk products, rice, maize meal, samp, pastas, sugar,
    <br>cooking oil, flour for baking, and many different cereals like cornflakes and oats,
    <br>and tasty spreads for sandwiches like peanut butter and jam.
    <br>For their nutrition, fresh vegetables are included like cabbage, potatoes, butternuts, carrots, onions,
    <br>beautiful green peppers, and seasonal fruits like bananas, oranges and apples.
    <br>All children like treats, so we have crisps, biscuits, ice cream, custard, jellies, and ice lollies too.
    <br>Personal items are things like shampoo, conditioner, soaps, various creams for face, body and hair,
    <br>toothpaste, toothbrushes, face towels, shoe polish, and Vaseline.
    <br>Beautiful Bibles are provided for the girls in the safe house too.
    <br>Household products were purchased in bulk and these are: santizers, disinfectants, pot scourers, garbage bags,
    <br>soaps like dishwashing liquid and washing powder, mops, brooms, feather dusters, and cleaning swabs.
    <br>It is our privilege today to be here in Johannesburg at The House Group
    <br>and I'm standing with Riana Gasper, who is the Managing Director.
    <br>We have made a commitment to our children to keep them safe, healthy, well-fed,
    <br>and well educated during this lockdown period.
    <br>The man of God instructed us also to get you air conditioning (heater),
    <br>sewing machines, laptops, a freezer, and a fridge.
    <br>Thank you! This room gets freezing cold!
    <br>So, as the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua teaches us:
    <br>the beauty of life does not depend on how happy we are, but on how happy others are because of us.
    <br>So he instructed us to give something extra, which is vouchers to the value of 30,000 rand.
    <br>I really think we are covered even if our president says: "Lockdown till July"!
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV!!!
    <br>We love you!
    <br>Your life is a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>Give and receive more of what you plant.
    <br>The Tshwane Leadership Foundation is an inner city community organisation with programmes,
    <br>health facilities, shelters for women, children, the youth, and the homeless.
    <br>Umbrella charities like the Tshwane Leadership Foundation
    <br>have multiple projects to address issues of poverty.
    <br>These umbrella foundations need bulk groceries for their various shelters.
    <br>The bulk groceries include: 20 kg rice, 200 tins of canned vegetables, 50 kg maize meal,
    <br>120 litres of milk, sugar, 200 tins of canned meat, oats, pastas, soups, sauces,
    <br>20 kg each of all fresh vegetables like cabbages, potatoes, onions and carrots.
    <br>The clothing includes men's and women's long-sleeved jackets to keep warm,
    <br>shoes, underwear and baby clothes.
    <br>The bedding includes: 60 blankets, 40 mattresses, and 60 pillows.
    <br>Personal items include: soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and towels.
    <br>And the household items include: sanitizers, dishwashing liquids, bleaches, and disinfectants.
    <br>We also purchased a large box deep freezer and a large fridge, a stove with oven
    <br>and tents for the homeless, who cannot be accommodated in shelters
    <br>but are forced to sleep outside in stadiums and parks.
    <br>So, today we are in Tower Village in the city of Pretoria, South Africa, and I'm with Wilna de Beer.
    <br>She's the CEO of The Tshwane Leadership Foundation.
    <br>This building, the Tower Village, used to be a brothel.
    <br>We used to do outreach here to the women in prostitution
    <br>and, eventually, through our low-cost housing company, Yeast City Housing,
    <br>we approached the owner and asked if we could develop this into proper low-cost housing.
    <br>He refused, but a while later, through prayer and God's grace, he put it up for auction.
    <br>We currently have 82 housing units here and we have this specially built facility
    <br>for vulnerable communities where we can run our programmes.
    <br>We are here in Tower Village with Mr. Themba Mkhwanazi. He's the site manager for Tower Village.
    <br>Themba, would you please explain to us more of your day-to-day work,
    <br>how you go about caring for these families and the people living in your facility?
    <br>At the moment we have six patients that we've taken in, and we are looking at taking up to 29 patients,
    <br>so that we operate at full capacity.
    <br>We are going to take in elderly men, for now, aged 55 and above, who have chronic illnesses.
    <br>It could be mental health or any kind of care that they need, so that we can care for them.
    <br>So we are not basically a shelter; we are a healthcare facility.
    <br>Before I came here - to Tower Village - I came from Limpopo.
    <br>My parents and siblings said I was living a rough life;
    <br>I used to drink too much but now I quit everything, and now I'm a churchgoer.
    <br>I even registered my company now.
    <br>I changed my lifestyle, but they don't want to accept me back.
    <br>So I decided to come to Pretoria and roam around the street
    <br>until the government picked me up from the street.
    <br>So if it wasn't for Tower Village and the shelter and what they are providing for you, where would you be today?
    <br>My life would have been completely shattered.
    <br>I don't know where my life would be if it wasn't for this organisation.
    <br>I thank this organisation, which took me from the street and put me here where I am today.
    <br>I am fed and taken care of, as you can see.
    <br>At the front door, there's a message on a paper: "Please sanitize your hands before entering."
    <br>And the Holy Spirit gave me this one:
    <br>"Please sanitize your mind and emotions before entering a room and communicating with people."
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for all the help you have given me so far.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>There is no amount of contribution too little or too great for the projects at hand.
    <br>Let every hand be on deck. As you do so, may the good Lord prosper you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>In a world that cares less, we should care more.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua and thank you, the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>You have made all this possible.
    <br>Good morning, Emmanuel TV viewers, our names are Mr and Mrs Makgoba.
    <br>Get involved in God's projects and He will get involved with you.
    <br>The breadth of our success is determined by the depth of our relationship with Jesus Christ.
    <br>We would like to further extend our gratitude in thanking the man of God, T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV Partners, who completely funded this outreach.
    <br>Without them, this would not be possible.
    <br>Good morning. I'm Ronald Knott-Craig from Pretoria, South Africa.
    <br>I just want to say a big and huge thank you from the bottom of my heart to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>It was a humbling experience and it was really needed.
    <br>I saw the appreciation by all the people that received the food parcels.
    <br>By your generosity, you gave to the people in need.
    <br>Thank you very much for that.
    <br>I'm Dr. Irene, an Emmanuel TV Partner.
    <br>I want to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>for funding this charity project here in South Africa
    <br>to help the needy and destitute during this lockdown due to the sickness.
    <br>Good morning, my name is Michelle.
    <br>All that you see was provided by Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Thank you for your love; thank you for your care.
    <br>What a rare privilege it is to be in a position to give, as it is more blessed to give than to receive.
    <br>In perilous times such as these, we all stand in desperate need of God's mercy and favour
    <br>and what better way to position yourself to attract God's attention
    <br>than by becoming a father to the fatherless,
    <br>a companion to the lonely and a benefactor to those in want.
    <br>Let this be an inspiration to us all to reach out to the weak and vulnerable in our communities,
    <br>especially at a time like this.
    <br>May God bless you as you become His hands of relief and comfort to a distressed world.
    <br>Emmanuel! My name is Matthew Buthelezi from South Africa.
    <br>I'd like to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua, Emmanuel TV  Partners and viewers all over the world.
    <br>The slogan of the church is: Changing lives, Changing nations, Changing the world.
    <br>We have seen Prophet T.B. Joshua doing that in South Africa during this lockdown.
    <br>He was giving food to the homeless and elderly.
    <br>A thousand million thanks are not enough.
    <br>We say thank you, Prophet T. B. Joshua, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Better is not good enough; the best is yet to come!
    <br>Good morning, I'm Anthea van Heerden from South Africa.
    <br>I watched as hundreds of thousands of Rand were spent on goods for this nation.
    <br>I was amazed when I looked at your love, your kindness, your generosity towards all.
    <br>I will never ever forget the faces of the people as they received: the destitute,
    <br>the homeless, the desperate and the elderly.
    <br>You have touched this nation.
    <br>I want to thank you for what you are doing in this world
    <br>and I want to thank all the Emmanuel TV Partners!
    <br>Emmanuel! My name is Maki Lekaba from South Africa.
    <br>Everyone has something to give.
    <br>You must assist with all you have to reach out;
    <br>it can be your time, your strength and your money.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>for funding and sponsoring the South African Virus Outreach,
    <br>giving to the needy, the aged and different charitable organisations.
    <br>Good morning, my name is Hercules. I am an Emmanuel TV Partner from Johannesburg, South Africa.
    <br>It really touched me and just made me question again my own commitment
    <br>to the poor, the needy and to giving.
    <br>Just seeing how much Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV give to the poor and the needy and
    <br>just really care for them - even in a country that's not their own
    <br>and people that they never even met.
    <br>I am Phillip Imoru from Johannesburg, South Africa.
    <br>This wonderful outreach is fully funded by Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>God bless you. Thank you.
    <br>Good morning, my name is Izak Malan from South Africa.
    <br>Indeed, we touched many lives when we gave them the gifts here in South Africa.
    <br>Their richness and simplicity, their humbleness and joy are contagious.
    <br>It touched me deeply.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners, thank you for funding this outreach in South Africa.
    <br>Good morning, my name is Elmarie Malan from South Africa.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for funding this charity in the virus crisis.
    <br>Thank you so much Emmanuel TV Partners for your donations.
    <br>We have seen how a little bit can mean so much to those in need.
    <br>As you bless, God will bless you.
    <br>As you give, God will give to you.
    <br>Indeed, it's a much greater blessing to give than to receive.
    <br>Let love lead. The best is yet to come.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Pinky Netshidzati, a Partner of Emmanuel TV from South Africa.
    <br>It was a blessing indeed.
    <br>I thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>It was the Emmanuel TV Partners and Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>who sponsored all that we have given out today to the needy.
    <br>Good morning. My name is Kenny. I am from South Africa.
    <br>There is something special about helping those in need,
    <br>about being involved with God's plans and projects that words cannot express.
    <br>Indeed, no state of being is as rewarding as living in tune with God.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners sponsored this entire outreach.
    <br>Thank you for making this possible.
    <br>My name is Kabelo Raphatlello from Pretoria, South Africa.
    <br>As the Bible says, there can be no loving without giving.
    <br>I would like to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>for making this project a success. Emmanuel!
