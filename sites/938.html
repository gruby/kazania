  <p>    
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Harrison.
    <br>I'm 40 years old.
    <br>I was among the 126 deportees last week from Libya.
    <br>We wanted to cross the mediterranean sea to Italy.
    <br>God saved me as I was not supposed to go home free.
    <br>I am supposed to come to His altar and thank Him very much.
    <br>It would be very bad for me to go home without thanking God.
    <br>So, I decided to thank God in this church.
    <br>We were 126 deportees last week.
    <br>The last two weeks and upper last week was almost 600 thanks to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>They gave us 7 million naira and two bags of rice each.
    <br>A big thanks to Pastor.
    <br>Mr Harrison
    <br>Libya Deportee Sharing Life Experience
    <br>The experience I had there - what my eyes have seen, I cannot put it into words.
    <br>I was working as a dock worker at Ibru Jetty where they have between 18 and 20 oil companies.
    <br>After some of the dock workers were registered as staff and I was not, I had to think of a way forward.
    <br>That was how I took the decision to go to Italy through Libya.
    <br>On our journey from Liby to Italy, we were almost 142 passengers who travelled
    <br>through the mediterranean sea in an inflatable boat.
    <br>When we were about to embark on the journey, it was discovered that the boat was leaking
    <br>and we decided to turn back.
    <br>They wanted to go again but 30 minutes into the journey,
    <br>it was discovered that there was not enough fuel, so we came back again.
    <br>My mind was telling me not to go.
    <br>I wanted to go back but I decided that as a man, I would take courage and go,
    <br>instead of staying in my country.
    <br>I was forced to embark on that journey.
    <br>The third time, when we passed Tunis, we got to another country before getting to Italy.
    <br>On getting to Malta, the boat started leaking again. People started screaming,
    <br>especially the girls among us. We were warned not to stand up and were told to squat.
    <br>Out of fear, the girls started standing on their feet, causing the boat to sink.
    <br>People were falling into the water, dying.
    <br>We were even seeing many whose boat had already capsized.
    <br>We were not even thinking about them; we were thinking about how to save our own lives.
    <br>There was a woman and a man who had a newborn baby there.
    <br>They held the baby up in their hands as the boat was sinking.
    <br>I was even thinking of what I could do -
    <br>turn by turn I would die so let me pray and ask God for forgiveness in case I died.
    <br>I was even looking at the woman; she held the baby in her hands but she sank with her husband.
    <br>I was running to the other side that was not in the water but unfortunately,
    <br>their boat sank on the other side and both of them died.
    <br>When the boat went down, I held onto a jerry can that had been full of fuel but was then empty.
    <br>The man who was controlling the boat held onto another jerry can.
    <br>I had a little experience of diving work when I was in Ibru Jetty, so I held the jerry can to my stomach.
    <br>Then, some criminals pulled their boat alongside ours
    <br>and started using their sticks on people who were trying to rescue themselves.
    <br>They struck people with their sticks to make them sink into the water.
    <br>They found three of us who were capable to make a move and took us into their boats.
    <br>They used their guns to hit our heads.
    <br>That is where I got this very big wound here; it tore, blood started coming out and I was unconscious.
    <br>When I opened my eyes in the night, I found myself in an underground prison.
    <br>We were three - myself, the captain of the boat and another boy; we were in the prison.
    <br>I thought we were in a hospital but we were in a prison.
    <br>It was as if we were watching a film.
    <br>They threw us inside an underground cell and closed the door.
    <br>When they closed it, the place was dark. We could not see anybody.
    <br>When they served us food, they would give us a thin slice of bread, half the size of my hand.
    <br>They would give us one slice of bread with a tiny amount of butter to eat.
    <br>In the afternoon, they would not give us any food.
    <br>In the evening, they would give us one particular type of food.
    <br>Most of my friends will be shouting now, "Ah, thank God that this boy is even giving his testimony
    <br>of what he experienced!"
    <br>They would bring a particular type of food.
    <br>It was just as if when one cooks beans in a pot and pours soap and water inside to wash them -
    <br>the mixture of water and soap was how the water which they served us at night looked like.
    <br>They would bring that together with a piece of bread.
    <br>That was the food we would eat 'til the following day.
    <br>After three days, inside our dark prison cell, when they had opened the door, trying to give us food,
    <br>we discovered that one of us was already dead.
    <br>We shouted in their language that someone had died in our midst.
    <br>After telling them that somebody had died, we were beaten with concrete pipes.
    <br>They would use that to flog us every day after bringing us out.
    <br>Whenever they wanted to feed us, they would throw us outside in the sun
    <br>and ask us to face its direction after eating.
    <br>They later took us to another location where we met not less than 10,000 Nigerians.
    <br>We were placed in different prisons. People were crying.
    <br>The worst treatment they gave to Nigerians was deceiving them that they had jobs for them in Italy.
    <br>After collecting some money from them, on getting to Benghazi or Tripoli,
    <br>they would stop the vehicle and ask those whose money was not complete to step down
    <br>before they were moved into three rooms.
    <br>Those three rooms which had only two ceilings harboured over 60 Nigerians.
    <br>There was no air or ventilation.
    <br>Men are strong but some of the women would have died before daybreak.
    <br>We would be escorted with guns to go and throw away their corpses in the desert.
    <br>We would dig shallow graves, put them inside and use our legs to cover the sand over them and go.
    <br>That day, I was even hungry, looking for food to eat.
    <br>I went to a place in Tripoli where we usually went in search for jobs.
    <br>My main aim for going to that place was to get a job so that I could get something to eat.
    <br>We were two in number - myself and a friend called Eze.
    <br>As we were looking for a job, a car parked beside us and the driver asked us to enter.
    <br>After we had entered the car, the driver brought out a gun and threatened to kill us if we talked.
    <br>We cooperated with him.
    <br>Then, he took us to a seaside and upon getting there, we found 52 dead bodies on the shore.
    <br>We were asked to load the 52 dead bodies into a truck.
    <br>By then, I was hungry and had no strength to even lift one of the dead bodies,
    <br>most of which were mutilated.
    <br>The clothes I wore that day were the ones I had worn for almost one year without changing.
    <br>I didn't even have enought money to eat, much less to buy clothes to change into.
    <br>Imagine a situation where someone would just call you to come and help him pump his tyres,
    <br>only for him to bring out a gun when you bend down to do so, shoot you and then drive off.
    <br>Some of them would ask me to come and help them start their generators
    <br>but before entering their house, they would hide all their female children and wives.
    <br>They would lock them inside a room.
    <br>Anything that made one see their wives,
    <br>they would make sure that the person did not come out alive.
    <br>Blacks don't see their wives with the naked eye.
    <br>In the market, the men normally sell okra, tomatoes and seasoning - that is man's work there.
    <br>Let me continue with my story.
    <br>So, they said we should pack the dead bodies - 52 dead bodies.
    <br>I was then weak - no food.
    <br>Now, I am even strong.
    <br>We were even looking for food when they told us to pack the dead bodies.
    <br>We were whipped and told to load the dead bodies into the truck. So we started to pack them.
    <br>52 dead bodies.
    <br>We offloaded the 52 dead bodies in the truck and took them to the desert where we buried them
    <br>in shallow graves - three bodies in one grave.
    <br>After burying the entire dead bodies, do you know what they gave us as compensation?
    <br>We were compensated with a piece of bread and a small portion of maccaroni.
    <br>They would force us to eat it and afterwards, ask us if it tasted nice.
    <br>We would have to agree that it tasted nice, otherwise, they would beat us to death.
    <br>They would pack us back into the vehicle, drop us off at the place they picked us from
    <br>and kick us out of the vehicle.
    <br>I could not even tell my story to anbody there. My whole body would smell of dead bodies.
    <br>When I would enter that place I stayed, there was no water to bath and nothing to use.
    <br>Before I could buy water, I would have to pass through another compound to fetch the water.
    <br>If I decided to narrate the whole ordeal I pass through in Liby, no one would go home today.
    <br>Ok, we know you have a lot of experiences to share with the people of God.
    <br>Because of time, we will just go straight to how you finally got back to Nigeria.
    <br>By the grace of God, I dreamt about Prophet T.B. Joshua that I came to this church
    <br>and he poured water on me.
    <br>When I woke up, I told my friends that I dreamt about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>In the prison there, we were almost 10,000 Nigerians
    <br>and even as we were leaving, we left about 7,000 there.
    <br>People are still there suffering.
    <br>I told my friend that I had dreamt of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He replied excitedly that we would still go back home by the grace of God.
    <br>Fortunately for us, the next day, we heard that the UN started compiling the list of prisoners.
    <br>We started jubilating saying, "We are going home!"
    <br>Ten days later, we were moved to Tripoli in preparation for going home.
    <br>As I speak, many people in the Libyan prisons are wishing to come to The SCOAN
    <br>and give testimony about their experiences.
    <br>When we came here, T.B. Joshua compensated us with the sum of 7 million naira
    <br>and two bags of rice each. We thank God for that.
    <br>So, on coming back home...
    <br>The man of God said we should go back to our homes.
    <br>Unfortunately for me, when I got home, I became so sad as the only child I had
    <br>and was hoping to come home and meet (a boy), had died.
    <br>I had no home to stay, no house - nothing.
    <br>My wife even got married to another person because everybody thought that I was dead.
    <br>Even when I got to my compound,
    <br>some people picked up sand and threw it at me to confirm if I was truly alive.
    <br>I then told them that I was not dead, that I had spent five years in Libya,
    <br>three of which I spent in an underground prison without ever coming out.
    <br>When I came back, people started throwing sand at my body.
    <br>I told them that instead of allowing them to pour sand on me,
    <br>I would hug them to let them know that I was not a spirit.
    <br>As for my wife, she could not wait for many any longer because she thought that I was dead,
    <br>likewise others.
    <br>She told me she had gotten married to another man.
    <br>When I enquired about my son, she told me that he had already died one or two years ago.
    <br>I came back to The SCOAN to share my feelings with the man of God.
    <br>This is my friend. We are staying in the same compound.
    <br>I don't have anything bad in mind.
    <br>I just want everybody to know that I have forgiven my wife and everybody.
    <br>The only thing that is my joy is that I came out to see a free world. I can turn around, I can look,
    <br>I can run, I can buy any food I want to eat. I thank God for everything.
    <br>This is my friend.
    <br>This is my friend that got married to my wife.
    <br>Look at the screen of your television. This was exactly last week
    <br>when they came in their numbers - about 126 of them. They were deported from Libya.
    <br>He was among those that were deported. They made their way to The SCOAN right from the airport.
    <br>When they arrived at The SCOAN premises,
    <br>the man of God was moved with compassion and mercy,
    <br>in conjunction with Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world,
    <br>and they were all blessed with the cash sum of 7 million naira and two bags of rice for each person.
    <br>They were strictly advised to go back to their various homes and visit their family members
    <br>because their family members were expecting them back home.
    <br>We can see them when they came to The SCOAN -
    <br>helplessly because they were deported with nothing; they were frustrated.
    <br>When they came, they were helped at The SCOAN.
    <br>After they were blessed with the sum of 7 million naira and two bags of rice for each person,
    <br>they were advised to go back home and pay their family members a visit.
    <br>That was how he went back to his residence, where he was living,
    <br>the very home he left when he travelled to Libya five years ago.
    <br>But unfortunately for him, the wife made him to understand that
    <br>they thought he was dead because the news that came to her was that the husband was dead.
    <br>And unfortunately for him, the very son he left behind was already dead.
    <br>So the wife had no choice but to get married to the very friend he loves so much.
    <br>And that is the friend that is standing by him right now.
    <br>As you can see on the screen of your television,
    <br>the very brother who shared his experience a moment ago
    <br>was among the 126 Libyan deportees that visited The SCOAN last week.
    <br>They were blessed with the sum of 7 million, as you can see them there.
    <br>They were so excited that they were blessed with 7 million and two bags of rice each.
    <br>They were advised to go back home and visit their family members.
    <br>We also want to bring it to your hearing
    <br>that this very group has not been the only group that had been coming.
    <br>Ever since this year, they have been turning up in their numbers.
    <br>The moment they are deported, they find their way to The SCOAN for refuge.
    <br>Of course, this is the house of God.
    <br>The Bible says we should be a father to the fatherless and a benefactor to the needy.
    <br>That is what The SCOAN has been established for and that is what we are living for.
    <br>Right from the airport, they made their way to The SCOAN and they were blessed.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Now, as he made us to understand, he visited his house.
    <br>On getting there - the wife thought he was dead
    <br>and she got married to his closest friend who is standing by him here.
    <br>And the son he left behind is already dead.
    <br>But we have to understand one thing: His friend came here, simply because he heard
    <br>how the man of God had been helping people who were deported.
    <br>He is a very good friend of his. And when he learnt that the man of God helped his closest friend,
    <br>after he was deported with nothing from Libya, with a certain amount of money and two bags of rice,
    <br>he said he has to join him to The SCOAN to give thanks to God
    <br>and receive prayer for his own blessing as well.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ for them!
    <br>So, let's hear from his friend.
    <br>My name is Sulaimon Abolaji.
    <br>I am here because of my friend. We all live together in Ejigbo.
    <br>We heard that he had already died.
    <br>I took over taking care of his wife when he left.
    <br>After waiting a long time without seeing him,
    <br>with the information we had that he was already dead, I got married to his wife.
    <br>We were surprised when we saw him.
    <br>I was among those who poured sand on him, asking him if he was still alive.
    <br>But we thank God.
    <br>He is my best friend.
    <br>Due to what happened, we sat down, talked and reasoned together.
    <br>The main thing that brought me here is that when he explained to me that it was The SCOAN
    <br>that assisted him - he explained the whole story to me
    <br>and I had been hearing a lot of things about The SCOAN.
    <br>I have a friend who is a muslim who works with the ministry
    <br>because he knows that the man of God (T.B. Joshua) does not discriminate -
    <br>he does not look at tribe or religion. I also heard the same thing from my friend.
    <br>That is why I deemed it fit to come here.
    <br>If only the whole of Nigeria is watching and can emulate what Prophet T.B. Joshua has been doing
    <br>in our country, I think things would be better than they are.
    <br>That is why I came.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>All I want is for him to forgive and forget everything that has happened.
    <br>That is how God wants it and I still love him as a friend.
    <br>That is why I deemed it fit to come down to this place to rejoice with him.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>We have of the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world -
    <br>the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua said we should give you the sum of 120,000 naira
    <br>for you to start your life anew and also two bags of rice.
    <br>I thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for blessing me with the sum of 120,000 naira
    <br>to start a new life in my village.
