    <br>ANOINTING WATER REVIVAL
    <br>IN THE UK
    <br>DELIVERANCE CONTINUES
    <br>The action of the Holy Ghost still continued,
    <br>as one by one God continued to release His power
    <br>and promises into the lives of the people receiving the ministration of the Anointing Water.
    <br>Watch how one of the principalities contrary to this purpose was disgraced,
    <br>lost its grip and was cast out of this young man.
    <br>Who are you, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ?
    <br>Speak, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>What have you done to this body?
    <br>Holy Ghost, fire.
    <br>Holy Ghost, fire all over your body.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I command you to speak, in Jesus' name.

    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You are declared free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I don't have strength.
    <br>Do you know what just happened to you?
    <br>I could hear things but...
    <br>- Do you know what you have just said?
    <br>- No.
    <br>Jesus Christ has set you free from the demon that was tormenting your life.
    <br>Give glory to God!
    <br>I praise You, Father!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>ANOINTING WATER REVIVAL
    <br>IN THE UK
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Brother, you are very welcome today to the Anointing Water Revival in the UK.
    <br>Please tell us your name and whereabouts you are from.
    <br>My name is Chris Jansen.
    <br>I am originally from Sydney but I am living in Netherlands for two months now.
    <br>- Originally from Australia?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>You are very welcome.
    <br>Can you tell us what were the problems that actually brought you here
    <br>to the Anointing Water Revival in the UK?
    <br>I had depression for many years of my life.
    <br>I haven't had any breakthroughs with my life, my situation,
    <br>with moving in the ministry or work.
    <br>I had a lot of suicidal impressions and impulsions in my mind.
    <br>I had a lot of torment mentally in my life.
    <br>How did this all begin?
    <br>It began with panic attacks.
    <br>I began to get anxiety when I was 12 and it continued till I was 25.
    <br>When those panic attacks and that depression comes, how does it really affect you,
    <br>what are the things they cause you to do?
    <br>It isolated me; I didn't have a social life.
    <br>It put me in a place of feeling hopeless and despaired.
    <br>In life, it was very difficult to move forward and find my way.
    <br>What about your career? 
    <br>How has this affected your career?
    <br>Part of the reason why I came was to get breakthrough and my purpose in life
    <br>and find whether it is in ministry or career.
    <br>It had really affected my life in a major way.
    <br>As a result of all of these problems, how did you find people were treating you,
    <br>and the reactions of people towards you?
    <br>People can tend to turn off you because you are not feeling so fantastic within yourself
    <br>and it was very difficult to form new relationships and friendships
    <br>because of that uneasiness within me.
    <br>What about your health?
    <br>How has your health been affected?
    <br>I had lost a lot of weight.
    <br>I didn't feel very nourished.
    <br>When I ate, I felt like I was never full.
    <br>My health definitely needed to improve.
    <br>In the midst of all this, what were the kinds of dreams you were having?
    <br>I had been having certain nightmares at night.
    <br>Sometimes, I was hanging in my dreams
    <br>or I would dream of the ocean or a big storm or I was falling or things like that.
    <br>You mentioned as well that this led to suicidal thoughts.
    <br>Just explain a little more, how severe were these?
    <br>I would get impulsions if I saw any sharp object of any kind
    <br>and would imagine sticking it into myself or in someone closest to me
    <br>and also of a gun to my head.
    <br>Thoughts like that would always fill my mind,
    <br>like jumping in front of a train or things like that.
    <br>I would never do it but it was always a torment.
    <br>So we really understand how so many years you have been tormented
    <br>by this terrible demonic attack.
    <br>We give glory to God that you came here to the Anointing Water Revival in UK and the Lord touched you.
    <br>Just tell us your experience;
    <br>what happened today when the Anointing Water was ministered? 
    <br>When the Anointing Water was ministered,
    <br>I started feeling tremendous panic inside of me like I was losing breath
    <br>but also a very great anger and hatred was coming from within me.
    <br>I could not control my words.
    <br>It was like I had no control over anything I was doing.
    <br>It was very different.
    <br>Tell us; immediately after the deliverance - how are you feeling right now?
    <br>I am feeling lighter; I feel very light, actually.
    <br>I feel like I have lost a sense of heaviness.
    <br>The Lord is working on my mind now and the Holy Spirit has delivered me.
    <br>Amen. So you mean to say that you are feeling very light now, after your deliverance,
    <br>and you know that Jesus Christ has completely set you free?
    <br>Amen. I believe.
    <br>Yes. I stand on that.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>We rejoice with you for this wonderful deliverance.
    <br>We just want to encourage you,
    <br>that now you have been delivered by Christ's Word, you must be ruled by His Word,
    <br>for this deliverance to be permanent.
    <br>Finally, what is your word of advice, your message to the people out there
    <br>about the power of God working through the Anointing Water
    <br>and the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>The Holy Spirit anoints all who are willing to do the work of Christ Jesus
    <br>and I believe that just as Paul anointed handkerchiefs or aprons,
    <br>that the Holy Spirit will anoint water, too
    <br>to deliver you from your circumstances and situations
    <br>so that you can fulfil the plan of God for your life.
    <br>Amen. Glory be to God.
    <br>We want you encourage you to stay close to Jesus
    <br>and the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I praise You, Lord!
