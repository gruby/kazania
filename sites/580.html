  <p>    
    <br>How are you, brother?
    <br>Fine, sir.
    <br>Yes, where's your wife because I see you divorced - you have separated from your wife?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is not your will for this to happen.
    <br>It has happened, but you don't know how to go about it. This has affected you greatly.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I want to see you because it will be difficult for you to settle down because you are very disappointed.
    <br>Lately, you never believed that this divorce would lead to this.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>It has affected your business - everything in your life.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What you are doing now is a funny thing.
    <br>Once you have said it, it's over because I see your relationship with this strange person
    <br>and this started from the internet and all that.
    <br>I want to see you. Please come and wait for me.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Good Morning. My name is Childress Simmons Jr.
    <br>I'm from the United States of America.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>I was married and I did get divorced.
    <br>I also did have a strange relationship on the internet.
    <br>Thank you very much. So can you share with us -
    <br>we want to learn from your experience and from what God Almighty has done in your life.
    <br>Can you share with us how this whole issue started - the strange relationship on the internet?
    <br>When I was around 7 or 8 years old, I remember going into my parents' room,
    <br>and there was a magazine with naked pictures although the breasts and the private part were covered.
    <br>I didn't see that magazine any time before that day or after that day - just that day.
    <br>As I got older around 11 to 12, my friends would bring pornographic pictures,
    <br>and I started looking at them.
    <br>Eventually my dad died when I was 10 and my mom remarried.
    <br>I went to stay with my step-father and my step-brother had libraries of pornographic magazines and DVDs.
    <br>My step-brother loved me but he just didn't see anything wrong with that.
    <br>I would spend hours watching and looking at those magazines.
    <br>So this was right from the young age of 7 or 8 years old
    <br>that pornography started entering into your life, is that right?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>So from there, how did the addiction to pornography really take hold and
    <br>begin to affect your life in all areas?
    <br>Eventually, you get an appetite for it.
    <br>As I got older, when circumstances would become hard,
    <br>I would just automatically use pornography as a pacifier.
    <br>It was there to pacify me in my hardship.
    <br>As I continued to mature and grow,  the pornography got more perverted.
    <br>When you get on the internet, you click on it,
    <br>it would just give you galleries of different categories
    <br>and you can click on whatever you want.
    <br>I would watch whatever would stimulate me and spend hours at a time doing it.
    <br>I would stay up all night and then go to work.
    <br>It's by the grace of God I didn't die because I would fall asleep driving on the road.
    <br>God spared my life.
    <br>So the man of God mentioned that this addiction to pornography,
    <br>the strange relationship on the internet,
    <br>started affecting your business, your career and everything about you.
    <br>Apart from like you said in driving, how else did it affect your job?
    <br>Well, in the job I wasn't focused on doing my job to the best of my ability.
    <br>My focus was gone. I spent all night masturbating,
    <br>and so I really didn't have the energy to do my job to the best of my ability.
    <br>Okay sir, what happened before you married your wife? How did the addiction to pornography
    <br>affect the beginning of the relationship and ultimately the divorce we heard about?
    <br>When you are watching porn, it changes your mindset on how you look at women.
    <br>You don't look at women from the inside out but from the outside in.
    <br>You look at them like a dessert.
    <br>Instead of getting to know a person,
    <br>you would experiment or have sexual relationships; then you would get married.
    <br>That's not the way you are supposed to start a union.
    <br>What were your thoughts the time that you said okay, let me try and get married?
    <br>Was it as a way of escaping from pornography or what was the thought behind that?
    <br>I thought that as it was a sexual problem, if I had a wife, it would go away.
    <br>You can have sex with your wife and be satisfied and you can satisfy her.
    <br>But there's a different appetite that must be satisfied that comes over you.
    <br>You are driven to do it; it's like you are compelled to fulfill that appetite.
    <br>Once you are done, you feel exhausted; you may cry and pray
    <br>but it seems that something just takes over.
    <br>So after your first marriage, how did the pornography affect the marriage?
    <br>Was it still continuing during your marriage with your first wife?
    <br>Yes, as with my first wife, in a marital relationship, if you are not friends,
    <br>you become alienated from each other.
    <br>She would go her way and you would go your way,
    <br>leaving you all the time in the world to masturbate,
    <br>watch porn, do whatever you want because there is no union.
    <br>So, yes, it affected my first relationship.
    <br>So tell us, how did that then move on and end the relationship - ending in a divorce?
    <br>Eventually, as the saying goes, 'If it starts badly, it will end badly'.
    <br>That's what happened; it started badly and ended badly.
    <br>We severed the relationship but I didn't get deliverance.
    <br>I married again and I had the same problem.
    <br>After the first divorce, what then happened in terms of this pornography?
    <br>Did it go up another level? Did it get worse?
    <br>It basically stayed the same.
    <br>After I got married the second time, the relationship was very uncomfortable.
    <br>It wasn't friendly; then it got worse.
    <br>I started going on the internet and spent more time on it than ever before.
    <br>So what was your thought in getting married the second time,
    <br>after you saw that marriage couldn't actually solve this problem the first time?
    <br>What was on your mind when going into the second marriage?
    <br>I went to church and I thought I was well.
    <br>So, I thought I would give it another try and we could have a blessed marriage.
    <br>But what I realised was that I needed deliverance,
    <br>as you can't have a sincere mind without spiritual deliverance.
    <br>Thank you very much. At this time, did you never say, "Enough is enough.
    <br>I don't want pornography anymore" or you were just happy with it in your life?
    <br>Oh no, I wasn't happy with it because I was exhausting my body.
    <br>I was up all night and sometimes, I would come home from work
    <br>and have the desire to do it too.
    <br>I knew I was killing myself.
    <br>But at the same time, there was nothing I could do about it.
    <br>During my second marriage, I started searching the internet for solution
    <br>and that was when I saw Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Alright, sir. Before we hear more about Emmanuel TV,
    <br>tell us, what other ways or efforts did you make to stop this habit of pornography and masturbation?
    <br>I fasted, received prayers, got an internet filter and did various things to stop
    <br>but you cannot stop externally.
    <br>When people say just stop it, I don't believe that.
    <br>It has to stop spiritually and you need deliverance.
    <br>So you mean that even if at a time you stopped yourself physically,
    <br>you would still fall back into it again? There would still be an urge?
    <br>Definitely, I noticed that every six months I would get a strong appetite to consume it.
    <br>Then, after the six months I could be okay and think everything was good.
    <br>Then, it would come again very strong.
    <br>So, the second marriage you then went into,
    <br>how was the relationship any different or was there no difference - just like the first one?
    <br>The difference between the two was that the women were different.
    <br>So, they were different experiences.
    <br>But as far as the affection went, they both turned out the same way.
    <br>Something came to change the way we looked at each other and cared for each other,
    <br>which left doors open for pornography and perversion.
    <br>And you think this spirit of pornograhpy and masturbation was behind
    <br>that loss of affection and separation once again?
    <br>I know because it has been a root in me since I was young.
    <br>So, I think it was the main leader of everything that went wrong in my life.
    <br>So, after this second marriage also ended in a divorce,
    <br>what then happened after that?
    <br>After that, you reach your lowest point because you have divorced again
    <br>and you're wondering, "What's happening, what is wrong with me?"
    <br>Then, I started consuming more from pictures, to videos, to live camera,
    <br>that's when there is another person you are looking at and
    <br>you engage in sexual activities.
    <br>Is that person necessarily in your area or neighbourhood or where could that person be?
    <br>From all over the world, all you have to do is click on a particular photo
    <br>and that person can be anywhere - Germany, Australia - and you engage over the camera.
    <br>So this is how you had gone from pornographic magazines, up to videos,
    <br>up to the internet, and now finally, to having sex via a web cam with somebody.
    <br>Was the desire never satisfied up until this point?
    <br>The desire is never satisfied, it grows.
    <br>It grows stronger and it gets perverted because what you used to watch,
    <br>you can't watch it anymore because it doesn't satisfy you,
    <br>so you have to watch something else or do something else.
    <br>So at this time, you were facing divorce.
    <br>What kind of relationships were you having with women at that time?
    <br>After my divorce?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>After my divorce, during my second marriage, I saw Emmanuel TV.
    <br>That was when I realised that a person could be housing demons.
    <br>Even though I knew I had issues, I wouldn't mess with a woman, no matter how pretty she was.
    <br>I just realised that she could be housing demons in her.
    <br>I wouldn't mess with a woman or person.
    <br>Ok. So then tell us, from that area of going into webcam,
    <br>did you ever have the mind of wanting to meet any of these women
    <br>you were seeing on the screen personally?
    <br>What then happened after that
    <br>in terms of your addiction to pornography and these strange relationships?
    <br>After you keep seeing pornography over and over,
    <br>you have images to manifest or duplicate.
    <br>Yes, it came to a point in time when I wanted to meet escorts
    <br>but deep down inside me, I knew it was the death of me if I was to go out.
    <br>The desire came but I just couldn't do it.
    <br>During this time that you had been introduced or initiated into this pornography and masturbation,
    <br>what kind of women would it be pushing you towards
    <br>or what kind of women would be coming your way that you would be seeing?
    <br>It never drew me to any type of physical relationship.
    <br>Physically, when I looked at a woman, I might lust after her
    <br>but I never wanted to live with her.
    <br>It was always spiritually or mentally where the perversion would take place for me.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>That was then how you started searching
    <br>and as you said, you found Emmanuel TV.
    <br>What gave you hope in Emmanuel TV?
    <br>What was it that brought about your coming here today?
    <br>I have seen people dealing with the same issue.
    <br>When you go to a church and talk about your issue, nobody responds back.
    <br>It makes it seem something is really wrong with you.
    <br>When I saw Emmanuel TV, I thought I could go and get help.
    <br>That drove me to come and get deliverance.
    <br>Ok, sir. Tell us again, what was the state of your mind at this time
    <br>before you finally came to The SCOAN?
    <br>What were the kind of dreams you were then having
    <br>and how did this affect you spiritually?
    <br>Spiritually, I started seeing spirits in my dreams, dealing with sexual immorality.
    <br>It started affecting me in the spiritual realm.
    <br>Alright, thank you very much, sir.
    <br>Lastly, before we hear about when you came to The SCOAN,
    <br>can you tell us about the women that you married
    <br>and the kind of women you had relationships with.
    <br>Were they the kind of people that you had thought, "Yes, this is the kind of person I want to marry",
    <br>or was there anything else about those two marriages you had?
    <br>When you are influenced by watching porn, you see women in a bad light -
    <br>I mean, not in the true light.
    <br>I was drawn physically to them but not to what was on the inside.
    <br>I would marry them based on how they looked.
    <br>What kind of women were they?
    <br>They had prior marriages and children.
    <br>I was always led to those type of women.
    <br>So the kind of women that came into your life because of that spirit
    <br>were people that had also had previous relationships or divorces and also had children.
    <br>Those were the kind of people you ended up marrying?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Finally then, you came to The SCOAN and we saw what happened.
    <br>You received a word of prophecy and your deliverance.
    <br>Tell us, what was that experience like and how are you feeling now after the deliverance?
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed,
    <br>prior to that, I had prayed, "Lord, if he just says a word, I know I am delivered".
    <br>At the prayer line, he hit me three times on my chest.
    <br>He came back and hit me two more times.
    <br>I didn't feel any fire or anything.
    <br>I want that to be known because I think sometimes, we become oversensualised.
    <br>But I just believed and I knew that I was made whole.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Truly, believing is the condition and as long as we believe, we are blessed.
    <br>So as you are blessed and delivered now,
    <br>tell us, what have the changes been since last week till this week?
    <br>My heart.
    <br>The grace of God on my heart
    <br>and how I see women - I don't look at them as physical objects.
    <br>They are daughters of God and are to be respected.
    <br>Glory be to God. Let's put our hands together for Jesus once again!
    <br>Once your heart is changed, everything about you is changed.
    <br>So I want to ask you about the prophecy that the man of God gave to you, sir.
    <br>Can you remind us of some of the points that the man of God said and
    <br>how they are really true for your life and what it was like at that time receiving this word of prophecy?
    <br>When he prophesied about the divorce, that was recent.
    <br>Nobody knew about that strange relationship on the internet.
    <br>God located me and I thank God for that.
    <br>It blessed me.
    <br>Glory be to God. One of the last points that the man of God said in his prophecy
    <br>was, how you had had such disappointments and you had never thought
    <br>that your life could come down to this level.
    <br>What do you have to say about that?
    <br>As a young man, I excelled in everything I put my mind to.
    <br>I was at the lowest point as a man - I mean, rock bottom.
    <br>That was very true. I was hopeless.
    <br>I thank God for my sister; she spoke life to me.
    <br>She said, "Your latter shall be greater".
    <br>I thank God for that.
    <br>And that was how you came here and God Almighty met you at that very lowest point in your life.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>So, sir, now as a changed man,
    <br>someone that has passed through the valley of the shadow of death,
    <br>and has come out stronger, what is your advice to viewers watching you all over the world,
    <br>specifically first of all for those who may be still suffering from a similar vice
    <br>to the one you found yourself in?
    <br>Don't take it lightly because this world pushes pornography, fornication and all that.
    <br>When you enter into that, you are opening yourself for the demons
    <br>and it is going to corrupt your heart.
    <br>If you die in that state, you will be tormented in hell.
    <br>Give your life to God and let God clean your heart and serve Him.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Mr Childress Simmons Jr.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>We would also like you to give a word of advice to parents
    <br>because you mentioned that this happened in your parents' house at the age of 7 or 8 years old.
    <br>That was the first exposure you had to pornography. What advice can you give?
    <br>Back then, we didn't have technology.
    <br>So, be careful of the books and things you have.
    <br>Now, you have TV, movies and the internet.
    <br>So, you really need to guard what your children are watching to protect their souls.
    <br>Alright. Thank you very much.
    <br>Lastly, to viewers all over the world, about the power of God Almighty
    <br>that is still working, that delivered you. What can you say about this power?
    <br>God is still a Deliverer
    <br>because I would never have thought I would be where I am right now.
    <br>I feel renewed.
    <br>I feel restored.
    <br>I know I am a child of God. I know I am redeemed.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>We can see something in your hands right now.
    <br>Can you tell us what this is and how this has been helping you?
    <br>This is the Faith Bracelet I use to meditate on the Word of God.
    <br>It really puts the Word of God in my heart
    <br>and it guides me throughout the day.
    <br>Hallelujah. So now, you are no longer thinking lustful thoughts or of pornography
    <br>or how to go and browse on the internet?
    <br>That's true because a dream came to me the other night of various women.
    <br>As soon as I saw their faces, I didn't look at their bodies, I just woke up.
    <br>But before, how would you have reacted in such a dream?
    <br>I would have gone on with the dream - continued it.
    <br>This is a confirmation that it is over in spirit and in truth.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Mr Childress Simmons Jr.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>So the last thing we want to hear from you, sir,
    <br>how are you feeling now? Are you fulfilled in your visit here?
    <br>Yes, I am fulfilled. I feel that I am a redeemed son of God.
    <br>Glory be to God. We encourage you, sir, truly you are delivered by the Word of God,
    <br>now make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>and for all those whose lives are centered in Christ Jesus,
    <br>better is not good enough, the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
