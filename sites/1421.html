  <p>    
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You may be seated, thank you,
    <br>as the Spirit directs.
    <br>Have you said your prayer today?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>Have you said your prayer today?
    <br>Can somebody answer me?
    <br>I said, "God, I'm coming to worship today and I pray that the man of God locates me and answers my prayer".
    <br>How did you offer the prayer?
    <br>I offered the prayer to Almighty Father to bless me, to remove every sickness that is in me,
    <br>and to make Prophet T.B. Joshua locate me today.
    <br>I prayed to God; first of all I thanked Him for bringing me safely to Lagos.
    <br>I told Him to locate me - God of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>that He should not pass me by, He should favour me - that was my prayer.
    <br>My prayer was: "God, I'm now here, in the arena of liberty.
    <br>Don't pass me by. May the Holy Spirit be here with me to the end.
    <br>Let me receive from the man of God what I have been crying for."
    <br>Are you crying or laughing?
    <br>I'm laughing now because I'm here.
    <br>In sincerity of heart, answer this question:
    <br>Did you read your Bible before you offered that prayer?
    <br>No, I did not read the Bible.
    <br>OK, give it to my father.
    <br>Have you read your Bible today?
    <br>I haven't read the Bible today.
    <br>I did not read my Bible, because I woke up very early...
    <br>No, don't tell us.
    <br>You have not woken up too late to pray, but you woke up too late to read the Bible.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>This is where we are going today.
    <br>Is it possible to start speaking Spanish without understanding the language?
    <br>What of French?
    <br>What of English?
    <br>Prayer has a language and the language is in the Word of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Prayer has a language and the language is in the Word of God.
    <br>Prayer and Bible reading should always go together
    <br>because the language is in the Word of God.
    <br>Prayer and Bible reading should always go together
    <br>because the language is in the Word of God.
    <br>The Word of God is our contact with God.
    <br>There is no way you can contact God with your language – the language of today -
    <br>without the language of the Bible.
    <br>You cannot contact God with the language of today; it is not possible.
    <br>"Hello. Fine. How are you?"
    <br>You can only contact God with Bible language – the language of the Bible.
    <br>That is the Word of God.
    <br>Can you see where we are getting it wrong every day?
    <br>We are getting it wrong.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we open the Bible and read, we are hearing God talk.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>When you open the Bible and read, you are hearing God talk.
    <br>The problem we have today
    <br>is simply because we are reading the Bible with so much unforgiveness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why the Bible is Literature to us.
    <br>When you read the Bible with so much unforgiveness, you are reading Literature.
    <br>With so much bitterness, pain of the past, bad feelings towards others,
    <br>you are reading Literature, History, Biology, Chemistry.
    <br>That is the problem we have; we are reading the Bible with so much unforgiveness,
    <br>bad feelings towards others – those who insult you, those who cheat you.
    <br>You must read the Bible with a free spirit.
    <br>A free spirit is a spirit that is free from unforgiveness, bitterness, hatred,
    <br>pain of the past, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>Today, we read the Bible with so much unforgiveness, bad feelings, pain of the past.
    <br>What do you expect?
    <br>You should not be surprised if the Bible means nothing to you.
    <br>Scripture is important for prayer because it is what God says Himself.
    <br>What is important to prayer?
    <br>Scripture is important for prayer because it is what God says Himself.
    <br>When you open the Bible and read, you are hearing God talk.
    <br>When you are praying, it is you talking.
    <br>This is the reason you are to fill your prayer with Scripture.
    <br>FILL YOUR PRAYER WITH SCRIPTURE
    <br>To use Scripture in prayer is to take God at His Word.
    <br>When you fill your prayer with Scripture, you are in line with God.
    <br>Can you see; the three people we called -
    <br>one said, "I woke up very late to read my Bible", but she did not wake up very late to pray.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You woke up very late to read your Bible but you did not wake up very late to pray.
    <br>"Give me biscuit, oh Lord..." - you never wake up very late to do that.
    <br>You have never missed that - it's a tradition.
    <br>"God, I'm going to my work - protect me" but to read your Bible...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you open the Bible and read, you are hearing God talk.
    <br>That is the language of prayer.
    <br>Prayer has a language and the language is in the Word of God.
    <br>Scriptural prayer releases God’s power.
    <br>What releases God’s power?
    <br>“Be healed,” and there is healing – that is scriptural prayer.
    <br>“Be delivered,” and there is deliverance – that is scriptural prayer.
    <br>“Be blessed,” and there is blessing – that is scriptural prayer.
    <br>Word-enriched prayer.
    <br>The Word of God enriches prayer.
    <br>FILL YOUR PRAYER WITH SCRIPTURE
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Enrich your prayer with the Word of God.
    <br>Enrich your prayer with the Scripture.
    <br>Fill your prayer with Scripture
    <br>because scriptural prayer releases power – brings Jesus into the scene.
    <br>What brings Jesus into the scene?
    <br>"Jesus!"
    <br>In the person of the Holy Ghost; you see Jesus appears immediately - that is scriptural prayer.
    <br>Scriptural prayer brings Jesus into the scene.
    <br>Can you see the reason why you have not been offering an effective one?
    <br>Because you pray with so much unforgiveness, bitterness, pain of the past, bad feelings towards others.
    <br>Can you answer me what is prayer?
    <br>How will you go about your prayer?
    <br>I know you prayed today without reading Bible.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Tell us, how did you read the Bible.
    <br>I read it through the direction of the Holy Spirit - 1 Samuel.
    <br>You read the hard cover.
    <br>Yes daddy.
    <br>What is the hard cover?
    <br>That is my Bible.
    <br>Not that you just sit down and start reading on the laptop.
    <br>No, daddy, I read it chapter by chapter every day.
    <br>Hard cover.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>Tell us what you read.
    <br>I read the Book of 1 Samuel.
    <br>What actually directs you there?
    <br>By the grace of God, I have been reading...
    <br>Read what you read.
    <br>We want to learn from our mummy here today;
    <br>where you read.
    <br>I read about King Saul.
    <br>He was disobedient to God and that was why God removed the throne from him.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>After reading about King Saul - how did you offer the prayer?
    <br>I prayed; I saw what disobedience can cause in one's life
    <br>and I prayed that God would give me the grace not to disobey Him.
    <br>Clap for Jesus.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>After reading the Bible, she used the point there as a prayer point,
    <br>which is a very wonderful point.
    <br>As Saul disobeyed the Lord,
    <br>she said, "God, give me the spirit, the power above disobedience".
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>You have been reading the Bible...
    <br>Every day, by the grace of God.
    <br>Can you tell us the dividend, the reward.
    <br>The dividend has been wonderful.
    <br>Once you have any challenge, by the special grace of God, if the Spirit of God directs you...
    <br>I'm looking at international passport here - what is it doing inside your Bible?
    <br>You are looking for visa.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>And you want to pray over this.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>You don't need to pray over it - once God wants you to go there...
    <br>You don't need to pray over - the Lord should talk to the embassy to give you visa and make them sleep...
    <br>You don't need to pray over it; when it is time to go there, you will go there.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>The challenge we have is attitude.
    <br>Yes, daddy; that is true, sir.
    <br>You say, "Lord, at the time I will be going there, don't let them ask me any questions."
    <br>Why you don't want them not to ask you questions?
    <br>They would not ask you about your bank account, they would just say,
    <br>"OK, come. Where are you going?", and give you visa.
    <br>Some of us carry pens because we want to do exams.
    <br>You are going for examination;
    <br>if you did not read your book, how will you pass?
    <br>You ask God to put every answer in your head just like that, without you reading.
    <br>It is what we have done - we pray that God should guide us and enrich us.
    <br>We need grace because after we have finished this job, God still needs to mark it.
    <br>If you have finished reading your book and you are going for an examination, you should say,
    <br>"God, I have read - please mark my job".
    <br>After you have finished the job, God needs to mark it.
    <br>Sometimes, when we have finished reading, the job, God may mark it as wrong.
    <br>Our effort is not an approval; God's effort is an approval - God's grace.
    <br>Can you see now?
    <br>You don't need to pray over it, going to the embassy,
    <br>just be right in the sight of God.
    <br>Say, "Lord, I'm here. You want me to go? Let Your will be done."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because where God wants us to be, is where His blessing is.
    <br>If God wants you to travel, His blessing will be there for you.
    <br>But if God does not want it, and it is not the design of God that you should go,
    <br>and you want to force yourself to go there,
    <br>definitely you will regret it.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>- Thank you, daddy.
    <br>You cannot read your Bible with so much unforgiveness, bitterness, envy, jealousy,
    <br>pain of the past, all kinds of pain.
    <br>Somebody calls me and bounces on me.
    <br>"Look at the way this little boy...  I trained him to school. He used to be my boy.
    <br>Look at the way he addressed me - very bad."
    <br>You hold this pain and you want to read the Bible - no!
    <br>As long as we hold offence of any kind,
    <br>the Bible means nothing to you and will have no meaning.
    <br>When you want to read your Bible, you should be prepared
    <br>to get rid of all offences, pain of the past.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Receive a free spirit.
    <br>A free spirit is a spirit that is free from offence, unforgiveness,
    <br>bitterness, envy, jealousy, bad feeling towards others.
    <br>Free!
    <br>Brace yourself and say, "Thank You, Jesus" - then you can take the Bible to read.
    <br>Using the Word of God, what you read in the Bible in prayer, is taking God at His Word.
    <br>Filling your prayer with Scripture proves that you are in line with God.
    <br>That is, your prayer is in line with God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Your challenge?
    <br>Difficulty in walking.
    <br>- Did you listen to the message today?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>What message are you taking home?
    <br>The message I'm taking home is that I'm healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I said, "What message are you taking home?"
    <br>"The message I'm taking home is that I'm healed."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you don't take this message I preached today home, you will not be able to maintain your miracle.
    <br>Not that you will not receive your miracle; you will receive it,
    <br>but you will not be able to maintain it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>If you don't this message home,
    <br>if you don't take this message to your heart,
    <br>you will receive healing,
    <br>but you will not be able to maintain it.
    <br>The one I give you is the one to maintain it.
    <br>Who gives you?
    <br>Jesus.
    <br>And Jesus is in His Word.
    <br>You must take this message, receive it in the midst of your heart,
    <br>if not, you will not be able to maintain the miracle.
    <br>It is better not to receive than to lose.
    <br>If you don't receive, it is better than receiving and losing it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>It is better not to receive than to receive and lose it.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>It is better not to receive blessing than to receive blessing and lose it.
    <br>Not to lose it - it is only the message of God.
    <br>You can even come here as a spy, and you have a very big pain.
    <br>You sit and while the prayer is going on, you say, "Let me see what they are doing here.
    <br>They are vomiting. This woman walks."
    <br>Before you know it, the pain in your body disappeared.
    <br>You now say, "The thing happened to me. The whole thing is real.
    <br>The pain I was having is gone. Will I continue to spy this church?
    <br>Will I continue to spy T.B. Joshua?
    <br>What will I do?
    <br>I need money; let me spy them. They will pay me huge money.
    <br>If I don't spy, they will not pay me.
    <br>If I don't say what I discovered, they will not promote me.
    <br>I will continue to spy and that healing will be there."
    <br>But the pain will still come back.
    <br>God just comes to tell you that what you are doing, be careful; no one can spy God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Think about maintenance.
    <br>All what you are here for now; salvation...
    <br>You have received salvation before but you lost it.
    <br>You were once saved - proper one.
    <br>Your salvation in the past - if they shot you, it would not enter.
    <br>But now; ordinary cutlass - they will cut your head.
    <br>"Jesus!" - before you know it, your head is gone.
    <br>You were once properly saved but you lost it.
    <br>All what you are here for, you had got it before.
    <br>It is only that you failed to maintain them.
    <br>You were once eating with Jesus but today - this time now, it is a problem.
    <br>Talking of miracle, blessing - forget.
    <br>Talk about maintenance; what I'm here for, how will I maintain them.
    <br>Talk about maintenance.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Talk about maintenance.
    <br>What you are here for is right on the table in front of you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When we are praying, just say,
    <br>"Lord, give me the grace to maintain".
    <br>It means you have believed that you have received.
    <br>"Give me the grace to maintain" - this is the prayer you should offer.
    <br>All what you are here for is a past tense victory.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are many people here who were millionaires in the past,
    <br>but now, they are on the street again.
    <br>Many had houses but today you can't give account of anyone.
    <br>Head of the company, thousand people working under you - but today, you are working under people.
    <br>You failed to maintain those things;
    <br>your love with your husband, wife, people around you - you failed to maintain this love.
    <br>Today, a lot of things have turned upside down.
    <br>Please, think about maintenance.
    <br>And to maintain this - the Word of God.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Scripture is important to blessing, salvation, all.
    <br>It’s the live wire of salvation, blessing, healing.
    <br>Scripture is very important because it is what God says Himself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again,
    <br>Scripture is important to my life.
    <br>Scripture is important to my salvation.
    <br>Scripture is important to my blessing.
    <br>Scripture is important to my career because it is the live wire.
    <br>It is what God says Himself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you wake up in the morning and take your Bible to read and you did not pray, you have prayed already.
    <br>While you are reading with meditation, you are praying already.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>When you read the Bible, you are praying.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Reading the Bible, you are praying - with devotion.
    <br>You need attention to read your Bible.
    <br>Very much.
    <br>Attention means being free of unforgiveness, bitterness, pain of the past.
    <br>If you have those pains of the past, you can't have a real attention.
    <br>If you are calling me now, "T.B. Joshua come!" and I'm not happy,
    <br>I will say, "Whom are you talking to? Please, leave me!"
    <br>Because I'm not happy, I'm disturbed.
    <br>But if I'm free from unforgiveness, bitterness, anger, bad feelings towards others...
    <br>I only have attention when you are free, free spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But there is fake attention,
    <br>which many of you exercise when you are reading your national anthem.
    <br>You do like this...
    <br>But something is itching you...
    <br>You that give attention to your nation, you are still going about doing evil against your nation.
    <br>Killing, stealing, destroy.
    <br>Real attention does not kill, destroy, hold offence, bitterness, anger,
    <br>have bad feelings towards others, pain of the past - real attention.
    <br>If you have attention as you are sitting here, you will not be thinking of your business at home,
    <br>you will not be thinking of when T.B. Joshua will leave today, or attend to me, what is going to happen,
    <br>when are we going to have grace, am I going to get healed.
    <br>Real attention does not think like that.
    <br>Your attention will be on what I'm saying and how to obey it.
    <br>You know you have a divided mind, divided spirit; you are here, you are over there.
    <br>OK, come on, thank you.
    <br>Stand up!
