  <p>    
    <br>My name is James.
    <br>I have sinned against Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I have sinned against God
    <br>and I have sinned against The SCOAN.
    <br>It all started years back; then, I was a militant.
    <br>About 16 years back, I used to be a militant in Bayelsa State.
    <br>As such, I have gone to so many places for charms for protection
    <br>with the result that if you shoot me, it will not affect me,
    <br>if you cut me, it won't penetrate.
    <br>I did all this because of the nature of the job that I was doing.
    <br>Later, I went for deliverance in one church.
    <br>After the deliverance, the man of God asked me to wait,
    <br>that he wanted to see me and talk to me, which I did.
    <br>After some time, he asked me if I would work with them.
    <br>I accepted; I said there is nothing wrong in working in the house of God.
    <br>I did not know that he was asking me to blaspheme against the man of God.
    <br>I have never met Prophet T.B. Joshua in my life.
    <br>I have never even seen him.
    <br>I had never even heard the name before.
    <br>So, I accepted the offer as they would pay me a huge amount of money
    <br>to testify against Prophet T.B. Joshua in any of their crusades
    <br>that Prophet T.B. Joshua is a satanic agent from the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>That I am in level 7 and he is in level 5, which I accepted
    <br>that he never mentions the name Jesus Christ in his church,
    <br>he only mentions 'Emmanuel'.
    <br>I danced to their tune because of the money involved.
    <br>They took me round many states in Nigeria and outside
    <br>to confess against the man of God, which I did.
    <br>In every crusade, lots of people gathered to listen.
    <br>I normally told them that Prophet T.B. Joshua is a fake prophet,
    <br>that he came from the pit of hell and that he is a satanic man.
    <br>That he and I are from the same occultic kingdom.
    <br>This took me through 2004 when I decided to leave the country.
    <br> I travelled out of the country, that I wasn't going to stay in Nigeria anymore.
    <br>Getting to where I was, I somehow found myself doing rubbish.
    <br>My life was somehow useless.
    <br>What I don't like doing was what I saw myself doing.
    <br>They went as far as calling me because I dropped my number with them
    <br>and also inviting me down to Nigeria for the same purpose.
    <br>After some time, my wife told me that I needed to put a Christian channel
    <br>in my house so that my son and her could have a future through it.
    <br>I never accepted but after some time, I said, "Well, let me do that".
    <br>I accepted the proposal of my wife and put the Christian channel in my house.
    <br>As time went on, I kept watching it.
    <br>Most times, when I came home, I would see her watching it and I would be annoyed.
    <br>I would say, "What is the meaning of all this? Please, I want to watch a film.
    <br>Put a film on; let me watch it. What is the meaning of all this rubbish?"
    <br>One day, I just switched to channel 33 where I saw Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I said, "What kind of channel is this?"
    <br>It was not quite two seconds when I saw The Synagogue Church.
    <br>I said, "Ah!"
    <br>I was so much interested; I said, "I must see what is happening".
    <br>Not up to 5 minutes, I saw the name Prophet T.B. Joshua and I asked myself,
    <br>"Could this be the man that I was blaspheming?
    <br>No! I don't think so. I have to listen".
    <br>In my life, I used to go to church where I played music, sang and did everything.
    <br>But to give my life to Christ,
    <br>because of what happened to me in the past, I saw church as a game.
    <br>I came to realise through watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>that I heard Prophet T.B. Joshua saying, "In the name of Jesus Christ!" times without number.
    <br>I said, "Ah, ah, but the people who asked me to confess against him said
    <br>that he does not mention the name of Jesus Christ, only 'Emmanuel'.
    <br>But I have heard Jesus Christ from his mouth, times without number.
    <br>No. I don't think I can remain here.
    <br>I must come down to Nigeria and free myself,
    <br>so that my family and I can have a bright future".
    <br>Man of God, please, I need deliverance.
    <br>Before I came here, they called me to come down to Nigeria
    <br>that a crusade was going to take place this December.
    <br>But I replied that I was not ready.
    <br>I think you will be delivered through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>For viewers all over the world: Many of you don't believe that through television, you can receive.
    <br>Through television is as good as a man of God laying hands on you.
    <br>I'm going to do that now to the man that claimed he was in the same cult with T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I'm stretching my hand towards the screen
    <br>and right now, you will see what will happen, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
