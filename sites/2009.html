    <br>RELIANCE ON GOD!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Many people in the Bible,
    <br>whom we regard as a pillar of faith,
    <br>had some doubt as well.
    <br>Not that they had less faith,
    <br>but their faith was challenged in a new way.
    <br>God does not mind doubt,
    <br>as long as we are seeking the answer from Him in the midst of doubt.
    <br>Allow your doubt to move you closer to God,
    <br>not further away from God.
    <br>Be patient
    <br>and let God answer your question
    <br>on His schedule, not yours.
    <br>We can serve God,
    <br>not in the old way,
    <br>but in the new way of living in the Spirit.
    <br>If you are wrestling with doubt,
    <br>attend a living church
    <br>and stay close to other living Christians.
    <br>Resist the temptation to isolate yourself
    <br>because doubt feeds on loneliness.
    <br>Never doubt your salvation.
    <br>Satan can never snatch you away from God.
    <br>RELIANCE ON GOD!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Thank you, you may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the summary : RELIANCE ON GOD
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The greatest thing satan aims at
    <br>in tempting good people
    <br>is to overthrow their position
    <br>as children of God and
    <br>cut off their dependence on God.
    <br>Cut off their what?
    <br>Dependence on God.
    <br>We seem to ignore God when trouble comes -
    <br>that is when the goings are tough.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in,
    <br>as a child of God,
    <br>your situation could be sickness,
    <br>could be affliction,
    <br>whatever you call it,
    <br>poverty, hardship.
    <br>Let me quickly take you to the book of Daniel 6.
    <br>I am taking it from verse one, before we go to the proof text.
    <br>Daniel 6:1 - "It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps, to be over the whole kingdom".
    <br>"The whole kingdom" -  that is to be the head overseer.
    <br>Daniel 6:2  - "... and over these, three governors, of whom Daniel was one,"
    <br>Daniel 6:2 - "that the satraps might give account to them, so that the king would suffer no loss".
    <br>Daniel 6:3 - "Then this Daniel distinguished ..."
    <br>- different by quality -  here as we go on,
    <br>Daniel 6:3 - "... himself above the governors
    <br>because an excellent spirit was in him".
    <br>What kind of spirit is that?
    <br>That is the grace.
    <br>This grace is not only for the full time ministers;
    <br>it is also for the laymen.
    <br>This grace they are talking about,
    <br>it is not only for the bold;
    <br>it is also for the shy.
    <br>This grace they are talking about,
    <br>it is not only for the strong;
    <br>it is also for the weak
    <br>- of which I am one.
    <br>The grace we are talking about,
    <br>it is not only for the men,
    <br>but also for the women.
    <br>It is not only for the intellectual,
    <br>but also for the uneducated
    <br>- of which I am one.
    <br>Daniel 6:10 - "Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went home".
    <br>Daniel 6:10 - "And in his upper room, with his window open towards Jerusalem,
    <br>Daniel 6:10 - "he knelt down on his knees three times that day and prayed and gave thanks before His God".
    <br>This means we can say, "Thank You, Jesus", whereas ordinarily there is nothing.
    <br>Somebody may plan to arrest, to embarrass him - he has not done anything.
    <br>But he went to the upper room.
    <br>"Thank You, God" is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>Nothing and nothing, but he still said "Thank You, God".
    <br>You too can say, "Thank You".
    <br>Even if your situation suggests otherwise,
    <br>you can say, "Thank You".
    <br>You can say, "Thank You, Jesus",
    <br>even if your situation suggests otherwise.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You can say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You know, one of the satanic tactics,
    <br>satanic strategies is to get you to doubt God's goodness.
    <br>He wants you to continue to ask for what you don't have,
    <br>whereas the one you have, he doesn't want you to say, "Thank You".
    <br>He doesn't even want to remind you.
    <br>What you don't have is what you focus on
    <br>and when you are spending most of your time
    <br>asking for what you do not have,
    <br>you may be slipping into unhealthy doubt.
    <br>He doesn't want you to remember at all;
    <br>he wants you to forget all God has been giving you.
    <br>He wants you to forget
    <br>and to focus on what you do not have.
    <br>That is satan for you.
    <br>Doubt comes when we fail to remember what the Lord has done for us,
    <br>and we concentrate on what we don't have.
    <br>"God, give me this, give me that".
    <br>You have a house already, you have a car, you have this, you have that.
    <br>You want to be a president. You want to be a senator. You want to be governor.
    <br>"God, I want to be a governor".
    <br>What of the one you have achieved?
    <br>Let's go to the book of Psalm 94 verse 19.
    <br>Psalm 94:19 - "In the multitude of my anxieties within me..."
    <br>- that is in the multitude of trouble within me -
    <br>Psalm 94:19 - "... Your comforts delight my soul".
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Many people in the Bible
    <br>whom we regard as a pillar of faith,
    <br>had some doubt as well.
    <br>Not that they had less faith,
    <br>but their faith was challenged in a new way.
    <br>Let someone say, "In a new way".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Look at the case of John the Baptist.
    <br>He was the one who gave the vision that, "Someone is coming. I will not be able to do this and that".
    <br>When the Person had come,
    <br>he had to send his disciple to go and still confirm, "Was He the one or should we expect someone?"
    <br>God does not mind doubt,
    <br>as long as we are seeking the answer from Him in the midst of doubt.
    <br>"TB Joshua - are you sure he's a man of God?"
    <br>"I'm not sure".
    <br>"I want to know".
    <br>"Did you hear about TB Joshua? The Bible says many will come and call My name".
    <br>"But I want to continue to pray".
    <br>"I want to know who he is".
    <br>So, allow your doubt to move you closer to God,
    <br>not further away from God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Allow your doubt
    <br>to move you closer to God,
    <br>not further away from God".
    <br>God does not mind doubt
    <br>as long as you are seeking answers
    <br>from God
    <br>in the midst of doubt.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the book of Habakkuk chapter 2.
    <br>Let's take our reading from verse 1.
    <br>Habakkuk 2:1 - "I will stand my watch and set myself on the rampart,
    <br>Habbakuk 2:1 "and watch to see what He will say to me"
    <br>Habakkuk 2 :1 "and what I will answer when I am corrected".
    <br>Be patient
    <br>and let God answer your question
    <br>on His schedule, not yours.
    <br>Be patient and let God answer your questions.
    <br>"Oh ..."
    <br>"I ..."
    <br>"The Bible says: Let the sick say I am healed, let the weak say I am strong".
    <br>"But I have said it; I am still not strong".
    <br>"I have said it: Let the poor say I am blessed. I have said it. I have confessed it, but still ..."
    <br>It may seem painful as a Christian.
    <br>A Christian can be sick in body
    <br>and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>It may seem painful,
    <br>yet it is not,
    <br>because it is not unto destruction.
    <br>It is not unto what?
    <br>Destruction.
    <br>A man can be sick in body, yet be a friend of God.
    <br>A man can be poor, yet be a friend of God.
    <br>It may seem painful, yet it is not,
    <br>because it is not unto destruction.
    <br>It may be to preserve him for the glory of God.
    <br>It may be to keep him for a new level in life.
    <br>It may be to stop him awhile
    <br>in order to prepare him for the journey ahead of him.
    <br>RELIANCE ON GOD!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Christianity is a relationship,
    <br>not a religion.
    <br>That you have a relationship with Jesus
    <br>does not mean hard times will not come.
    <br>In our spiritual walk with the Lord
    <br>there are hard and good times.
    <br>So today you begin to see everyone as religious.
    <br>When you meet 100 people, out of 100,
    <br>hardly you will see Christians among them.
    <br>Everyone has become religious people.
    <br>Our Lord came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.
    <br>He came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man,
    <br>whereas these religious people believe they must go to Heaven to see their God.
    <br>And this is why they measure their faith by the situation they are facing.
    <br>When they are sick, they are not a friend of God.
    <br>They lament, they murmur.
    <br>When they are poor, they see themselves as unfaithful -
    <br>as a result of their unfaithfulness.
    <br>Their sickness is as a result of their unfaithfulness.
    <br>Their disease is as a result of their sin.
    <br>Their hardship is as a result of their sin.
    <br>Our hardship is not like others'.
    <br>Our hardship, our trouble is not like others'.
    <br>Others' is as a result of their sin - hardship comes to them.
    <br>But in our own case,
    <br>it is meant for the glory of God.
    <br>But in our own case, it is meant for the glory of God.
    <br>The reason why everyone becomes religious people today - everyone -
    <br>there's no Christianity.
    <br>Where can you see the Christianity today?
    <br>What is the meaning of Christianity?
    <br>By our confession, what we are confessing, it shows that you are a religious man.
    <br>We can serve God not in the old way,
    <br>but in the new way of living in the Spirit.
    <br>The Spirit of God is the right given to us.
    <br>Anyone can say, "Jesus is Lord".
    <br>Not anyone can say it by the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>When you give the control of your life to God,
    <br>God will give you a new heart,
    <br>a new nature,
    <br>a new desire to please Him.
    <br>He will give you a new heart,
    <br>a new nature,
    <br>a new desire to please Him.
    <br>When you meet 100 people
    <br>hardly you will see one that is a real Christian.
    <br>All the others are religious people.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by 'religious'?
    <br>They don't walk by the Spirit.
    <br>They read the Bible.
    <br>They understand the Bible.
    <br>They preach it.
    <br>They teach it.
    <br>But they don't live by it.
    <br>They learn the Bible.
    <br>They know the knowledge of the Bible to preach it,
    <br>not to live by it.
    <br>What you are confessing shows that you are a religious person.
    <br>When you have a headache,
    <br>you begin to murmur,
    <br>you begin to complain.
    <br>You never know that that headache is not like others'.
    <br>If Christianity is a relationship
    <br>- not a religion -
    <br>then what are we talking about?
    <br>When you become a Christian,
    <br>satan can never snatch you away from God,
    <br>no matter what happens,
    <br>no matter what comes.
    <br>RELIANCE ON GOD!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>What is the way out now when we talk about doubt?
    <br>If you are wrestling with doubt
    <br>- listen, that is you wrestle with doubt:
    <br>"This is right" - you know you don't know whether it is right -
    <br>the answer:
    <br>attend a living church
    <br>and stay close to other living Christians.
    <br>Resist the temptation to isolate yourself.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because doubt feeds on loneliness.
    <br>That is why you have to stay close to other Christians.
    <br>Resist the temptation to isolate yourself.
    <br>If you want to keep to yourself,
    <br>there's nowhere you can go.
    <br>You have to stay close to other Christians
    <br>because doubt feeds on loneliness.
    <br>Let's quickly go to the book of Acts.
    <br>Let's just use a Biblical character.
    <br>Acts 7 verse 59.
    <br>It's all about Stephen.
    <br>Acts 7:59 -  "And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit".
    <br>Acts 7:60 - "He knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, 'Lord, do not charge them with this sin',
    <br>Acts 7:60 - "And when he had said this, he fell asleep".
    <br>In the case of Stephen,
    <br>the fear of being stoned
    <br>did not scare or frighten him
    <br>to abandon his faith.
    <br>The more he was stoned,
    <br>the more he confessed Christ,
    <br>the more he became stronger in his faith, belief and conviction.
    <br>What does this mean to you?
    <br>It means that when you are in trouble, hard times,
    <br>the more that hard time, the more your confession, "Jesus is Lord",
    <br>the more you pray the more,
    <br>the more you should fast the more,
    <br>the more you should believe, have faith the more.
    <br>But the opposite is the case today.
    <br>We seem to ignore God when trouble comes.
    <br>At each stone cast on him,
    <br>he confessed, "Jesus is Lord".
    <br>He saw his pain as a reason for believing.
    <br>RELIANCE ON GOD!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Do you see your pain as a reason for believing?
    <br>Why are you murmuring?
    <br>Why are you complaining?
    <br>Why are you crying?
    <br>Why are you lamenting?
    <br>Why are you counting how many years you have  been a Christian now?
    <br>Why are you comparing yourself to others?
    <br>He saw his pain as a reason for believing,
    <br>just as he did his good times.
    <br>He saw his pain,
    <br>his poverty,
    <br>his affliction,
    <br>his hardship,
    <br>his insults - just mention them -
    <br>as a reason for believing,
    <br>just as he did his good times.
    <br>Promise from God:
    <br>The Lord said, "I will never fail you and I will never abandon you".
    <br>That is what the Lord said.
    <br>When you look at the book of 2 Corinthians 6 verse 2
    <br>"For He says: In an acceptable time I have heard you and in the day of salvation I have helped you".
    <br>"Behold now is the acceptable time; behold now is the day of salvation".
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>It means never doubt your salvation.
    <br>Once you become a Christian,
    <br>satan can never snatch you away from God.
    <br>He will try;
    <br>he will not succeed.
    <br>Hard times will come.
    <br>It may be to keep you awhile,
    <br>in order to prepare you, organise you well,
    <br>because you seem to be mature.
    <br>Hard times will come;
    <br>it may be to strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>Hard times may come;
    <br>it may be to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>Your hard time could be sickness.
    <br>Your hard time could be poverty.
    <br>Your hard time could be hardship.
    <br>What is your hard time?
    <br>It may seem painful,
    <br>yet it is not,
    <br>because it is not unto destruction.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Never doubt God's desire
    <br>or ability to help you".
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again, "Never doubt God's desire or ability to help you".
    <br>I can't hear you. "Never doubt God's desire or ability to help you".
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>Never doubt God's desire or ability to help you.
    <br>When you are struggling with doubt,
    <br>take time to remember
    <br>the way and manner God has worked in your life.
    <br>As you recall God's track record,
    <br>it will strengthen you and give you a new hope
    <br>that no matter the situation you are in
    <br>it will not impair you, but improve you.
    <br>RELIANCE ON GOD!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When you are struggling with doubt,
    <br>take time to remember
    <br>the way and manner
    <br>God
    <br>has worked in your life".
    <br>You know you were once an embryo in your mother's womb.
    <br>Look at what you have become today.
    <br>Look at the case of David.
    <br>When David was brought to the king to defend his cause,
    <br>he simply testified how God had delivered him,
    <br>rescued him from the mouth of the lion and the bear
    <br>at his tender age.
    <br>If you are asked to come out for testimony
    <br>it is nothing but the immediate goodness of God -
    <br>just what happened now or what happened yesterday.
    <br>The one of last year, two weeks, three weeks ago...
    <br>And this is the work of satan.
    <br>One of satan's strategies,
    <br>one of satan's tactics
    <br>is to get you to doubt God's goodness,
    <br>to make you forget
    <br>all God has been doing and given you
    <br>and to focus on what you do not have.
    <br>What you don't have is what satan will want you to focus on
    <br>- what you don't have.
    <br>Or what you have, you don't say, "Thank you. No, don't worry".
    <br>The one - "No, you must have this".
    <br>What you don't have.
    <br>And when you are spending much of your time
    <br>on what you do not have,
    <br>you may be slipping into unhealthy doubt.
    <br>But when David was called upon,
    <br>when he went to the king, he met the king,
    <br>instead of running to the king and saying, "Yes, I want to fight",
    <br>he said, "Come on, king. Let me tell you about me. My identity".
    <br>He said. "Yes, God rescued me from the mouth of the lion and bear".
    <br>"At my tender age God delivered me and saved me".
    <br>The king said, "Oh, when you were very small?".
    <br>"Yes, I went out with cattle, cows".
    <br>"While I was giving them direction, the lion, the bear came out. I used my hands to kill them".
    <br>The king said, "Oh! You mean it? Okay".
    <br>Comparing Goliath to the bear is nothing.
    <br>Comparing Goliath to the lion is nothing.
    <br>I want to rest my message.
    <br>Think over it again.
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>When Daniel was being persecuted
    <br>and there was instruction from government, the authority to get him arrested
    <br>immediately he went into his upper room facing Jerusalem.
    <br>I know you.
    <br>If you were Daniel,
    <br>you would begin to rebuke the governor that gave that order,
    <br>the president that gave that order would be rebuked and bound.
    <br>But Daniel went straight and said, "Thank You, Lord".
    <br>"Thank you" is a response of a happy heart, joyful heart.
    <br>It means, we can be happy
    <br>whereas there is nothing and nothing to be happy about.
    <br>This should be the attitude of every Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "We can be happy,
    <br>whereas
    <br>there is nothing
    <br>to be happy about".
    <br>This should be the attitude of every Christian.
    <br>Thank you.
