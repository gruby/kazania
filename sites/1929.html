  <p>    
    <br>At The SCOAN prayer line, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Mr Agbai, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Touching his own nose, knowing that with faith as small as a mustard seed you can move mountains.
    <br>Mark 4:30-31.
    <br>Lord I believe
    <br>Sometime later, Mr Agbai came back to The SCOAN to testify of his complete healing.
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>Hosanna in the highest!
    <br>The Lord Jesus Christ has totally restored Mr Agbai's nose.
    <br>To demonstrate his healing, he begins to place his finger in the once infected area without any pain.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the Master Healer.
    <br>I am OK.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Kalu Agbai.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was nose cancer.
    <br>When I came on that fateful day, I was placed on the prayer line.
    <br>The pastor, marvellous Prophet T.B. Joshua -
    <br>a mere stretching of his hand and here I am today,
    <br>giving testimony that I am one thousand percent OK!
    <br>NOSE CANCER BURSTS AFTER PRAYER!!!
    <br>The man of God did not collect any money from me.
    <br>In fact, he wasn't even ready for my thank you.
    <br>But since that very day, up to today,
    <br>he has been the one who has been giving my money and feeding me.
