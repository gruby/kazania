  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I release you in the name of Jesus from the pain of the past!
    <br>I release you from deep hurt.
    <br>Be released!
    <br>I release you in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers once again, listen:
    <br>I release you, in the name of Jesus from the pain of the past!
    <br>Be released in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold unto an offence.
    <br>I release you in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Countless people, I mean countless Christians are imprisoned by offence.
    <br>It is a trap; it is an effective instrument used by satan.
    <br>I release you in the name of Jesus!
    <br>If you are a victim, I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>Pray along with Prophet T.B Joshua.
    <br>Touch the screen by faith in Jesus name.
    <br>Lord have your way. 
    <br>I give your my heart.
    <br>We believe that you have been inspired by the clip that you have just watched.
