    801
  </h3>
  <p>    
    <br>On Sunday April 16, 2017, during the Live
    <br>Service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua showed appreciation for the prayers of people around the world
    <br>following his prophecy the previous week.
    <br>He also gave further insight into world affairs.
    <br>This is what he said.
    <br>I want to thank you for your prayers.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you for
    <br>your prayers; I need to thank you.
    <br>I want to thank you, in a very big way.
    <br>On Thursday, I was in the mountain but I could see the atmosphere all over - prayer and fasting!
    <br>I thank you for honouring the voice of a Prophet.
    <br>Many people went for two days fasting and they came back on Friday night.
    <br>I was very happy.
    <br>When I saw these people, I said, "No, the
    <br>record will be changed".
    <br>What I was seeing that Thursday and I said, "Please, fast and pray on Thursday and Friday",
    <br>that particular Thursday, if not for your
    <br>prayers, I don't know what would have happened.
    <br>But you have seen the sign.
    <br>North Korea will still test it.
    <br>The one they tested, they will still test another one.
    <br>They are not going to give up - but God is
    <br>in control.
    <br>What I saw on Thursday when I asked you to fast: I said, "I am seeing a big temptation
    <br>that will cause arguments in the superpower community".
    <br>Before the thing was thrown, I had seen it
    <br>already.
    <br>What is this, the biggest bomb?
    <br>I saw it before I said it.
    <br>Two weeks before that time, I saw the biggest bomb.
    <br>That was why on Sunday, I cried out and said, "Please, what I'm seeing on Thursday, Friday - fast!"
    <br>I saw the biggest bomb and another superpower was saying they have the biggest!
    <br>The sign which you have seen - when the bomb called the 'Mother Of All Bombs' was thrown,
    <br>the Russians said they have the 'Father Of
    <br>All Bombs'!
    <br>Is that not trouble?
    <br>I said, "What I'm seeing - it will provoke".
    <br>I continued saying this since 2016.
    <br>Once again, I want to thank you for that Thursday.
    <br>I said you should fast and pray on Friday.
    <br>I was very specific because I saw it.
    <br>If you saw what happened in the Spirit, you would know that God loves you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you.
