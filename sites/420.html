  <p>    
    <br>During the Sunday live service, at the Synagogue Church of All Nations,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua led by the Spirit of God, moves in the midst of the people
    <br>prophesying to them, revealing the root cause of their problems.
    <br>Let's listen as he speaks to this woman.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Fine, sir.
    <br>There is a controversy over a child.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied to the woman that there was a controversy over a child,
    <br>the man of God invited her husband to come to The SCOAN the following Sunday.
    <br>Let's watch as God Almighty opens the case file of this family.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Rosemary Isibor Busari. I am from Edo State.
    <br>Last week Sunday, during the first service, the man of God came to me and prophesied to me.
    <br>He said there was a controversy over a child and the prophecy is true.
    <br>My children are there: the first one, the second one, I lost the third one.
    <br>The first one is the one the man of God was talking about.
    <br>I discovered that the father would beat him all the time.
    <br>Even when the child made very little mistakes -
    <br>where one should just say: "Don't do that again"
    <br>and let the child correct himself.
    <br>But he would beat him, as if he was a goat and he wanted to kill him.
    <br>I didn't like what was happening so I told my husband
    <br>that the way this was going was not really good
    <br>and that he should rather just correct the child and that would settle it.
    <br>He got angry with me and said that he was not the father of the child.
    <br>He told me that because I said the way he was beating the child was not right,
    <br>that I should take the child to the father.
    <br>They even called a family meeting, asking me who the father was.
    <br>I said that he was the father, that there was no other man to call father.
    <br>He is the father.
    <br>I am married to him. He is the father.
    <br>I said that I didn't come to his house with any child.
    <br>There was another instance, when the child went to
    <br>take his Common Entrance Examination.
    <br>The time the child told him to collect him was different
    <br>from the time they finished. So the child was the only one left and
    <br>the school decided to take him back to their own school,
    <br>as the exam took place in another school.
    <br>When the father got to the other school and couldn't find him,
    <br>he went to his own school and found him there.
    <br>He then brought him out of the class and took him far away,
    <br>where no one would see him and started beating him.
    <br>It was so severe that it was only through the intervention of some parents
    <br>that came to pick up their own children
    <br>and the security officer of the school that the child was rescued.
    <br>He was insisting that they should leave him, that he wanted to kill the child
    <br>or let the child kill him.
    <br>He has sent me out of the house because I told him that the drugs
    <br>he bought for the fourth child - he was reacting negatively to them
    <br>and that he should stop taking the drugs.
    <br>That was why he sent me out of the house.
    <br>The third child that died - he also bought the drugs I gave to the child.
    <br>The next morning, the child died.
    <br>So, the question now!
    <br>He said he is not the father of the child?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I am Yahaya Busari.
    <br>This is my first time of coming to church. I am a Muslim.
    <br>This is my ex-wife.
    <br>I first of all want to thank you for the honour you have given to me and to our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>So before you talk - thank you very much.
    <br>Thank you. Because every man has discretion.
    <br>As a Muslim, Alhaji, with your position,
    <br>you heard that T.B. Joshua said this and you did not mind.
    <br>This is the first time you enter into a church in your life.
    <br>You said: "That T.B. Joshua - I will enter his church today."
    <br>I want to say thank you very much for the honour.
    <br>He who honours a prophet will receive a prophet's reward.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Before you talk, I want to appreciate this. Thank you very much.
    <br>The bottom line of this matter is that these are my children
    <br>but whenever I want to correct my children, my wife will slap me.
    <br>They all see me as a stranger in my house.
    <br>If I enter my house, I will feel like a stranger. They no longer love me.
    <br>She turned the attention of our children only to herself.
    <br>About one month ago, I went out in the evening.
    <br>She called me that my son was ill.
    <br>I panicked and came home immediately.
    <br>I took both of them, Ramani and Maliki, straight to the pharmacy.
    <br>They gave them drugs. I didn't know that one of the drugs was garlic.
    <br>When you chew garlic, it will be smelling and having an offensive odour.
    <br>I gave the drugs to the children.
    <br>My wife then called me in the presence of the children
    <br>and asked me why I gave them these drugs -
    <br>whether I wanted to kill them.
    <br>She said I was a ritualist who wanted to kill her children.
    <br>She slaps me all the time in the presence of my children.
    <br>In short, I told her that since I am now a stranger in my house and a ritualist,
    <br>she should go and look for the father of the children.
    <br>That was why I told her that I am no longer their father.
    <br>This is a lesson to all of us. If I am standing here condemning flesh and blood,
    <br>condemning my neighbour, fighting people by name,
    <br>if I would say: "Alhaji - these people are not good, this pastor is not good", Alaji would not come here today.
    <br>This is an opportunity for me to tell him about my God and he will tell me about his own God.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Alaji, are these children living with you? How about that baby?
    <br>I have been taking care of them by myself since that time.
    <br>This baby?
    <br>Yes. I bathe him. I don't go anywhere.
    <br>Please, Man of God, you can ask them.
    <br>For the past three weeks, I bathe them.
    <br>I bathe this small boy two times a day - in the morning and evening.
    <br>I feed them and cook for them by myself since she left my house.
    <br>They are my children - all of them.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She says you are beating this child to the extent of saying he is no longer your child!
    <br>If this man really means that this child is not his own, why should he take them?
    <br>Why should he not allow you to take the one that is not his own?
    <br>But he took all of them and is living with all of them.
    <br>There are two issues now. The issue could be because of faith - that is, she is a Christian; he is a Muslim.
    <br>Maybe at the beginning... I am telling you vision, what is happening in the house.
    <br>They do not want to mention that but I am telling you some secret things that happened.
    <br>When they first married, the man is a Muslim, and she married him.
    <br>They were together and had many children.
    <br>But later she now began to say that she did not want to be a Muslim but a Christian.
    <br>That would begin to cause what? If the husband says "no"!!
    <br>Exactly. She always says so.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ! Rise up!
    <br>Rise up! Rise up!
    <br>They would not mention that.
    <br>There are many issues between husband and wife that they would not mention.
    <br>But as a pastor, I know.
    <br>Your first time entering the church as Alaji and you have never done so.
    <br>And you honour that invitation because of these children.
    <br>And you people are here and not even telling us the real reason, why you are fighting.
    <br>But not until I said that this is the cause.
    <br>And you are now saying: "Yes, this is the cause."
    <br>Man of God, when they called me and said that I should come,
    <br>I said I must go straight away, since it was T.B. Joshua that invited me.
    <br>Because I watch your programme every day in my house. You can ask her.
    <br>Both day and night.
    <br>You can ask her.
    <br>You can ask her, Man of God.
    <br>You can ask any of my children.
    <br>He watches Emmanuel TV every day - even in the night.
    <br>When I would be sleeping and have to go to the bathroom, I would see him.
    <br>He would be glued to the television every night, watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>My father watches Emmanuel TV every day.
    <br>That's how we were able to come here and solve this problem.
    <br>It is true.
    <br>I said: "As far as it is T.B. Joshua, I will be there immediately". I moved.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Please, Man of God, my wife said that I killed her father and my own son.
    <br>She said that I am a ritualist.
    <br>That is one of the reasons, why I am here so that you can touch me
    <br>and let me confess, how I killed her father and my own son.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>No, wait.
    <br>Next week, we will continue this.
    <br>But I want to assure you that the wisdom of Solomon is still there.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The following Sunday, God continued to use Prophet T.B. Joshua to demonstrate the wisdom of Solomon
    <br>in the life of this couple.
    <br>What is God's opinion concerning this family?
    <br>Will reconciliation be possible?
    <br>Let's watch what happened next.
    <br>Let's take a look at the book of Romans 13.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let me take a reading from the verse 1.
    <br>"Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities.
    <br>For there is no authority except from God,
    <br>and the authorities that exist are appointed by God."
    <br>Verse 2.
    <br>"Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God,
    <br>and those who resist will bring judgement on themselves."
    <br>Verse 3.
    <br>"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil..."
    <br>Let's read it together and take note of that. Write it on your paper.
    <br>That is the area we want to talk about.
    <br>Romans 13:3. "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil..."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let's take our topic this way.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: Good Christians are Good Citizens
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Good Christians are good citizens.
    <br>Going by Romans 13, the concepts of Christianity and good citizenship are inseparable.
    <br>They are both synonymous; both go in tandem, pari passu.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Whatever makes men good Christians makes them good citizens.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>Whatever makes men good Christians makes them good citizens.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When you look at the constitution of your country -
    <br>"thou shalt not kill, though shalt not destroy,
    <br>though shalt not this, though shalt not that."
    <br>Whatever makes you a good Christian, makes you a good citizen.
    <br>I am a good citizen.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I am a good citizen.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I am a good citizen.
    <br>If you are a good citizen, you must pray against broken homes.
    <br>Because at the beginning of marriage - for better, for worse.
    <br>In every law, once you get married - the law says: "For better, for worse; come rain, come shine."
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "I am a good citizen."
    <br>So if you are a good citizen, you must pray against broken homes.
    <br>I know, what it is to come from a broken home.
    <br>When I was one year old, I was left with my mum.
    <br>I know the pain and agony.
    <br>It is not the wish and it can never be the wish of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ,
    <br>to see these children without motherly care at this young age.
    <br>Coming to the issue of faith.
    <br>I am a Christian; I am not a religious man.
    <br>Striving against people and standing on the pulpit and speaking against others -
    <br>we are fighting the wrong battle.
    <br>We are to battle the spiritual entities that cause tension,
    <br>killing, stealing and destruction.
    <br>We are not fighting the physical appearance that we are seeing.
    <br>Our battle is not against flesh and blood.
    <br>The Gospel of our Lord, Jesus Christ, is the Good News.
    <br>The message is righteousness. When you hear it, it gladens your heart.
    <br>We have the ability to preach. Jesus makes it happen in the person of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>As a Christian, you need to apply yourself to your work;
    <br>you need to apply yourself to your duty, as a Christian soldier.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Apply yourself to your work, to your duty, as a Christian soldier.
    <br>When soldiers in the physical world go to work, they carry guns, ammunition.
    <br>But we don't carry such things.
    <br>Our weapons are not this ammunition we see, the guns we see but spiritual.
    <br>It is not the physical appearance that is our enemy.
    <br>We are not fighting the physical appearance we are seeing.
    <br>If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.
    <br>Can you tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.
    <br>Because if you are armed,
    <br>the Saviour that armed you will tell you the battle to fight.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>It is like I am telling this gentleman: "Oh, you are going to war. Have this weapon."
    <br>But if I will give you a weapon, I will tell you how to use it.
    <br>I won't just give you a weapon without teaching you or telling you, how to use it.
    <br>So the people that are fighting, striving against people,
    <br>standing on the pulpit,
    <br>speaking against others:
    <br>"That man is not good, that religion is not good, that person is not good" -
    <br>they are not armed.
    <br>If you are armed- the person that armed you, will tell you, how to use this weapon.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If we are not armed for battle, we will fight the wrong battle.
    <br>If we are not armed for battle, we will not be able to listen
    <br>to the inner voice of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Like country to country, when they are going to war,
    <br>before they give you a weapon, they have to take you to some kind of training -
    <br>how to use a weapon, the time to use it.
    <br>The battalion leader will tell you.
    <br>They will appoint you to the battalion. This is the leader that will lead you into war.
    <br>And he will teach you, tell you time and when to shoot.
    <br>Without hearing the signal, you cannot shoot.
    <br>When you hear a certain signal, it is telling you that they are close.
    <br>They have a sign.
    <br>Each country has its sign.
    <br>That is why when the United Kingdom gives sign to its soldiers in battle,
    <br>Nigeria will not understand what they are saying.
    <br>If Nigeria gives sign to its soldiers,
    <br>the British government will also not understand what they are trying to say.
    <br>Because they give you arms, they must also tell you what to use, how to use it, and the time to use it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you are not armed for battle, you will fight the wrong battle.
    <br>If you are not armed for battle, you will not be able to listen
    <br>to the inner voice of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The concepts of Christianity and good citizenship are inseparable.
    <br>They both are synonymous.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Good Christians are good citizens.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Good Christians are good citizens.
    <br>So, my brothers,
    <br>you have heard me.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am to preach, teach, but Jesus makes it work;
    <br>Jesus makes it happen in the person of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have seen the family.
    <br>They will continue to live together.
    <br>The Lord is there to determine their faith.
    <br>If this man could be here with me for one week,
    <br>I would only tell him about my Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>but I have no power to force anyone to be a Christian.
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>Holy Spirit, I look upon You, help me
    <br>I have no power of my own
    <br>I want to change you at all cost;
    <br>you want to change me to your place too at all cost -
    <br>this is where crisis comes.
    <br>Faith is a thing of the Spirit.
    <br>Thank you. You may be seated.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Go and take care of your home.
    <br>Take care of these children.
    <br>For the past seven days now,
    <br>what marriage is all about -
    <br>he has learnt and seen it.
    <br>But one thing I have discovered in your family
    <br>that there is a spirit of mental disorder in your family.
    <br>There is a mental disorder in your family; if you go back to your home and check,
    <br>someone in your family is mental.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Who?
    <br>His name is Christian; he's my younger brother.
    <br>He's mental.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>That thing is in the family; it started from your grandfather.
    <br>And you too have depression.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>And when this depression comes, you can abandon home and walk out.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So this is what we have to work on.
    <br>We should not hide under faith
    <br>and begin to cause crisis.
    <br>Don't use faith to cover up.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord; Jesus is Deliverer" -
    <br>deliver them! "Jesus is Lord" - show them the Lord.
    <br>We should not use that to cover up and begin to preach.
    <br>But what of that spirit that kills, steals and destroys?
    <br>Look at what the Bible says in that verse 3.
    <br>It says in Romans 13:3: "For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil..."
    <br>Love is very strong and we are known by our love.
    <br>For someone to be in the presence of God -
    <br>what else again?
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is used by God Almighty, as a commissioned solution provider,
    <br>as speaking with divine wisdom and direction,
    <br>the Busari family is restored.
    <br>They affectionately embrace and kiss each other,
    <br>proving that their past is over and a happy future lies before them.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus Christ.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>I am Alhaji Busari from Kwara State.
    <br>You are welcome, sir. And who are the people standing beside you here?
    <br>They are my wife and children.
    <br>I thank God. I have seen big changes.
    <br>Before, my wife and I used to quarrel but immediately we came here,
    <br>she changed and is now behaving well.
    <br>We are now alright and no longer quarrel.
    <br>So there is peace restored in the marriage?
    <br>Yes, we've been living in peace since we came here.
    <br>Before you came here, is it true that both of you have been separated for some weeks?
    <br>Yes, we separated; I asked her to go but now we have settled.
    <br>And how do you now see your family, the peace that is in your family,
    <br>and the way you are treating your wife and your children?
    <br>I thank God that there is now peace. Peace has been restored in my family.
    <br>2. Corinthians 5:18 states: "Now all things are of God who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ
    <br>and has given us the ministry of reconciliation."
    <br>Not only was the Busari family restored and reconciled through God's wisdom
    <br>but they were also given a cash gift of 300,000 naira by Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>He gave us 300,000 naira.
    <br>I thank him very much for giving us this money.
    <br>He is a true man of God.
    <br>So you were not expecting anything like this?
    <br>I was very surprised to see the amount of money he gave me and my family.
    <br>It is a lot of money for us.
    <br>So what can you say concerning how God is using Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>God is using him to help many people.
    <br>If not for the man of God, my wife and I would have been divorced by now.
    <br>We really thank God Almighty for your life. And what are you going to use this money for now?
    <br>I will use it for my business and to take care of my family.
    <br>Wonderful. We thank God.
    <br>Finally, after all that God has done for you, what do you want to tell viewers
    <br>about what Jesus is doing, what God Almighty is doing here in The SCOAN?
    <br>Although I have been watching Emmanuel TV and I know what he can do,
    <br>I thank God that if anybody has a problem like me,
    <br>they can run to him and he will solve it.
    <br>My name is Mrs Rosemary Busari. I am from Edo State.
    <br>The man next to me is my husband, and these are my children.
    <br>God has done a very wonderful thing in my life and family.
    <br>Before I came here, there were problems in my family and marriage -
    <br>terrible problems. We could not stay together without quarrelling.
    <br>He finally sent me out and this was not the first time he had sent me out.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, to my surprise,
    <br>the man of God singled me out from the multitude of people that were around.
    <br>He prayed for me, called my family and reunited us.
    <br>Now, we are living together happily.
    <br>I am grateful to God and the man of God.
    <br>Today, he gave us 300,000 naira.
    <br>For us to use and be happy. I thank God.
    <br>So since you came to this church, God has now reconciled you with your husband
    <br>and restored peace to the family.
    <br>Just tell us the changes you have been seeing in your marriage and family now.
    <br>We are together now but before now, we didn't stay together.
    <br>Jesus Christ loves us and is concerned about us.
    <br>He wants to be involved in everything about us
    <br>and walk us through whatever life brings.
    <br>If God is involved in our matter, it does not matter who else is involved.
    <br>My name is Wasiu Busari.
    <br>This is my father, my mum and my brothers.
    <br>I thank God for the reconciliation of my father, mother and brothers.
    <br>For three weeks, my father and mother were separated.
    <br>It was only my father, who took care of us; I didn't know where my mum went.
    <br>But I am happy now that Prophet T.B. Joshua has brought us back together
    <br>and we are now inseparable.
    <br>So you are very happy now that peace is back in this family?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We thank God. Do you believe now with your parents back together
    <br>that you have a very bright future and as you go to school, you'll become someone great in the future?
    <br>Yes, I believe.
    <br>My name is Baniki Busari.
    <br>Who are the people beside you?
    <br>This is my dad, my mum and my brothers.
    <br>Just tell us, what God has done for this family since you came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I thank God for what Prophet T.B. Joshua has done in the life of my parents.
    <br>Before, there were always fights, quarrels and arguments.
    <br>But now, I thank God for what He has done in our lives.
    <br>Now there is peace?
    <br>Yes, it is true, I believe.
    <br>Wonderful. We thank God Almighty for the peace that has been restored to this family.
    <br>My name is Ramoni Busari.
    <br>Who are the people beside you?
    <br>This is my father, my mum and my brothers.
    <br>Just tell us, what God has done for your family.
    <br>Before, my mother and father were separated but they are together now.
    <br>And you are very happy for that?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We thank God Almighty. This is a wonderful thing that God has done in this family.
    <br>Waving their hands joyfully, they give thanks to God.
    <br>The restoration and reconciliation of the Busari family is proof
    <br>that there is never a problem that Jesus Christ cannot solve.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
