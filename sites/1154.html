  <p>    
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Viewers, we salute your faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>I know today, the Spirit of God will talk to you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's quickly take our Bible to the Book of John.
    <br>John 14; I will take my proof text from John 14, the rest of the Book will be given to you.
    <br>“ ‘Do not let your heart be troubled…”
    <br>I told you about the word ‘heart’, it is your spirit they refer to.
    <br>Wherever you see the word ‘heart’, it means your spirit, biblically.
    <br>It refers to your spirit – man’s spirit.
    <br>“ ‘Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God…"
    <br>Without heart, you cannot have anything to do with God – without spirit.
    <br>He uses our spirit to get to us.
    <br>The spirit of God uses our spirit to talk to us.
    <br>This is why you see 'heart'.
    <br>“ ‘Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.
    <br>My Father’s house has many mansions;
    <br>if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?' "
    <br>It means there are so many mansions, big mansions,
    <br>that is why He is going there to prepare a place for you; there will be an accommodation for you.
    <br>Let's go to the verse 26, which is the proof text.
    <br>“But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
    <br>will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.”
    <br>That is the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Go back to that Book of John 14, Acts 16:7 and Luke 24:47.
    <br>That would be very good.
    <br>Also the Book of Ephesians 4:30.
    <br>In that John 14:26: "But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
    <br>will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.”
    <br>It means without that Holy Spirit, you cannot remember anything of Jesus.
    <br>This means, if you are not born of the Spirit, you are not born again.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true believer.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.
    <br>That is why there is a fashion today - they call religion one, they call Christianity the other.
    <br>You just choose where you want to belong - to religious people, or to Christianity.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Our heart is the contact point; it is the communication point.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>That is Christianity for you.
    <br>He came to restore the relationship and fellowship between you and God.
    <br>Religious people believe they must go there
    <br>but our God came to restore the relationship and fellowship between you and God.
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not born again.
    <br>You are not born again, you are not a Christian, you are not a true believer.
    <br>How can you be born of the Spirit
    <br>because our God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>That is why you have to be born of the Spirit.
    <br>Going by that Book of John 14:26,
    <br>and the Book of Ephesians 4:30,
    <br>you will find those key messages, and in Acts 16:6-7.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>If the Holy Spirit is a Divine Person, who is standing here?
    <br>Is it T.B. Joshua that is talking to you, or the Divine Person?
    <br>In you - Divine Person, if you are a Christian, believer, born-again.
    <br>I'm here, T.B. Joshua and the Divine Person is standing before you, but you don't know who is talking to you.
    <br>What happens will determine.
    <br>When the Divine Person talks, changes are beginning.
    <br>It means I'm here, but the appearance you are seeing is Mr. T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We have two natures in one person – the divine and human.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is a Divine Person.
    <br>This Divine Person we obtain as a gift from God upon repentance and baptism.
    <br>If you have not repented, you cannot receive that Divine Person.
    <br>You will stand to be preaching, not the Divine Person.
    <br>You have the ability to preach; Divine Person, the Holy Spirit preaches as He wills.
    <br>You have the ability, charismatic, you can talk but the Holy Spirit also talks as He wills.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit talks, changes are beginning.
    <br>This Divine Person we obtain, we receive as a gift from God, freely from God,
    <br>upon repentance and baptism.
    <br>What is repentance?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>Repentance means, being deeply sorry for sin.
    <br>I mean, being committed to a new way of life, from unfaithfulness to faithfulness;
    <br>being committed to a new way of life – from disobedience to obedience, from hate to love,
    <br>from unrighteousness to righteousness.
    <br>Being committed to a new way of life, that of serving God, following God
    <br>which comes when God’s Spirit begins to live in us.
    <br>You cannot do it; no one can do the work of the Cross, only God can.
    <br>You say, "I want to be obedient".
    <br>You want to be obedient?
    <br>You can be obedient to yourself but to be obedient to God, you need the Spirit of God.
    <br>This obedience comes when God’s Spirit begins to live in us.
    <br>The more you meditate, the more your heart acts upon the Word of God.
    <br>You can preach, I can preach but the Holy Spirit preaches as He wills.
    <br>When the Holy Spirit preaches, changes are beginning.
    <br>The words we speak in prayer, in counselling,
    <br>if they are not according to the true Word of God,
    <br>I mean if they are not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>they will be idle, meaningless and often times destructive.
    <br>Because when you call the name 'Jesus', and you are not calling this name by the help of the Holy Ghost;
    <br>when satan hears it - that name is like an eagle.
    <br>When there is an eagle flying, moving around, you see some chicken moving around;
    <br>you see the chicken running for shelter.
    <br>Just the same name 'Jesus' - satan does not even want to hear that named called -
    <br>whether that name is called with the help of the Holy Ghost but mere hearing that name 'Jesus!'...
    <br>If they now realise that you are calling that name by yourself, not by the help of the Holy Ghost -
    <br>they get you arrested, beating you.
    <br>This is what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>It is like you see a tiger, or lion and you don't know whether it is tied down.
    <br>Mere seeing lion - my brother, what will you do?
    <br>You don't want to know whether it is tied down or not - you run for your dear life.
    <br>Before you know the lion was tied down, you have disappeared.
    <br>In the same way the name 'Jesus' - when satan hears 'Jesus', "Who is calling the name 'Jesus'?"
    <br>By the time they sight you and they realise that the name you are calling
    <br>is not by the help of the Holy Ghost, you will pay dearly for it.
    <br>This is exactly what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>The words we speak in prayer - "In Jesus' name!", "Be healed!" - in counselling, in teaching,
    <br>if they are not according to the true Word of God, if they are not according to the Spirit of God,
    <br>they will be idle and oftentimes destructive – very dangerous.
    <br>The Bible says in Luke 24:47, ‘Repentance allows us to receive a new life from God’.
    <br>Repentance allows us to receive what?
    <br>Talk to me!
    <br>[- A new life.]
    <br>What allows you to receive a new life?
    <br>[-Repentance.]
    <br>Repentance.
    <br>What is that new life?
    <br>Repentance is our only hope of receiving God’s mercy.
    <br>We have the Holy Spirit because God’s Word plainly so indicates,
    <br>not because of some emotional sensation.
    <br>"I have received the Holy Spirit..."
    <br>Not because of some emotional sensation.
    <br>We have the Holy Spirit because God’s Word plainly so indicates.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"It is the Holy Spirit" - what kind of Holy Spirit?
    <br>Manifestation.
    <br>Not because of some emotional sensation, but because God's Word plainly so indicates.
    <br>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23, we are told that man is a divine being, spirit being.
    <br>The real thing about man is not his body but his spirit.
    <br>Man is a spirit being.
    <br>The real thing about you...
    <br>Tell your neighbour;
    <br>The real thing about me is not my body.
    <br>When we wake up in the morning, you make up, do your hair, look in the mirror -
    <br>you have forgotten the real thing.
    <br>You have forgotten to dress the real thing.
    <br>You have forgotten to make up for the real thing.
    <br>You have forgotten to put more hair, wig for the real thing.
    <br>You have forgotten to make up for the real thing.
    <br>You have forgotten the real thing.
    <br>Whom are we supposed to take care of first?
    <br>The real thing - tell your neighbour - should be the first priority.
    <br>You are supposed to take care of the real thing;
    <br>bath the real thing, make up for the real thing, take care of the real thing.
    <br>The real thing about you is not your body but your spirit.
    <br>Today, what are you taking care of?
    <br>Tell me how many times you have looked in the mirror and you saw the real thing,
    <br>and you know how it looks like.
    <br>Some of us look good, beautiful, handsome, but if you look at your real thing -
    <br>this is the way you look because we are not taking care of it.
    <br>Some of your real things look like...
    <br>And you look beautiful.
    <br>Sometimes, when I see people moving around, "Hi";
    <br>when I look at him to know the real thing in him, the real thing looks like...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “You will be very embarrassed when you see your real thing”.
    <br>Can you see the life we are living?
    <br>You would be very embarrassed, if God showed you your real thing.
    <br>Some of the real things look like this...
    <br>But you - you look beautiful, handsome.
    <br>You make up in the morning, you wake up, you take care of yourself, you do your teeth.
    <br>You say, "Can you get me salad?"
    <br>Have you fed your real thing?
    <br>"Salad, do you have salad there? No, I need salad."
    <br>And the real thing is suffering.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “The real thing about me is not my body”.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If God revealed to you your real thing, your real self, your real value, the way it looks like,
    <br>you would quarrel, "Why am I looking so handsome; look at it. Look at my real value and the way it looks."
    <br>In John 8, the Bible says, ‘When the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed’,
    <br>He meant the liberation of your spirit, not your body.
    <br>He meant the liberation of your spirit – man’s spirit.
    <br>This is what He meant.
    <br>It is a shame.
    <br>We live life in descending order instead of ascending order.
    <br>Everything about us like that.
    <br>You want to do this, that...
    <br>You keep doing things by yourself, not by the help of the real thing – your real self, your real value.
    <br>You keep doing many things.
    <br>You wake up; instead of consulting your real self whom the Holy Spirit works through, you abandon that.
    <br>When the Bible says, ‘When the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed’,
    <br>it means the liberation of your spirit – man’s spirit.
    <br>I’m telling you here - look at me, two personalities here today, but you don't know.
    <br>Look here - two personalities; the one that put on the suit - good, that is Mr. T.B. Joshua,
    <br>there is also one - my real self.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You cannot get involved in God’s project without your real self.
    <br>Man is a spirit being.
    <br>You are a spirit being.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[You are a spirit being.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"In the name of Jesus - be healed, be delivered!"
    <br>They take time, "Who is talking there? Is it T.B. Joshua that is talking?"
    <br>If it is T.B. Joshua, he is talking to himself.
    <br>Only you will hear him, and he will hear himself - but God...
    <br>He is making noise, he is talking to air.
    <br>See the whole world today - can you see? We are lost.
    <br>When it comes to things of the Spirit, we are lost.
    <br>You don't even know whether you worship God.
    <br>Because man cannot do the work of the Cross, only God can.
    <br>When we try to do the work of the Cross by ourselves, we are inflicting pain on ourselves.
    <br>What is the pain?
    <br>Our word is meaningless, oftentimes destructive, idle - it is pain.
    <br>"I'm here today to say 'Praise the Lord. Hallelujah!'",
    <br>and I'm not sent, inspired, not by the help of Holy Spirit, and I carry the Bible and say,
    <br>"Men, hallelujah!"
    <br>You see everybody enjoying, emotional - oh my God.
    <br>I'm inflicting pain on myself.
    <br>Whatever I say that day will be meaningless, idle, oftentimes destructive.
    <br>Pain.
    <br>When I finish talking here and go back to sleep; dream, vision -
    <br>beating me, killing me, asking, "Who sent you?
    <br>What are you saying? You are talking against us. You are rebuking us. You are satan's shame.
    <br>Do you know whom you are talking to? Who sent you to say that?"
    <br>Beating you mercilessly, pain, giving you shit to eat.
    <br>When you wake up, you will not tell anyone; only you know what happened to you.
    <br>They will ride you like a bicycle, "Go to your church. Go, and preach the Word of God".
    <br>Man has the ability to preach but the Holy Spirit preaches as He wills.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Intimation must come to us from the Spirit, "Do it this way, do it that way".
    <br>Suggestion must come from above to tell you,
    <br>"OK, talk to this person, pray, stretch your hand, no, don't do that, go, look..."
    <br>Suggestion must come from the Spirit.
    <br>If not...
    <br>Corresponding power - if not, and you start doing things on your own...
    <br>Because you are well educated, you can read Bible, you understand Bible - Bible is not literature.
    <br>The Holy Spirit moved on men of old to document the Holy Word.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We were talking about the Book of 1 Thessalonians 5:23 -
    <br>man is a spirit being, he is a divine person possessed of spirit, soul and body.
    <br>It is possible to identify our body; what of our soul and spirit?
    <br>Shall we say we have no soul and spirit because we cannot identify them -
    <br>because there is no emotional contact to prove their existence
    <br>or there is no emotional reaction to prove their existence?
    <br>Shall we say we have no soul and spirit when God says we have?
    <br>Let me leave you with this word:
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a Christian.]
    <br>No, let me put it this way; there are two Christians -
    <br>if you are not born again, born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[if you are not born again, born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.]
    <br>There must be corresponding power.
    <br>You must connect with your Father in Heaven.
    <br>A suggestion must come from above on what to do – an intimation,
    <br>if not, you will continue to live on copy.
    <br>"What did he say?"
    <br>"What do they say?"
    <br>"What is this?"
    <br>"Where should I go?"
    <br>You continue to live on copy.
    <br>When you are using a copy, and it is not original, you know how it is?
    <br>If I want to give you a book, and I make a photo-copy and give you that copy.
    <br>You continue to live a copy life.
    <br>Your business, your life, your health, your joy, your peace;
    <br>there is a copy-peace, copy-joy, copy-business, copy-happiness, copy...
    <br>Without corresponding power from above, without intimation, suggestion...
    <br>If you are not born of the Spirit, you are not a true Christian.
    <br>You can be the richest in the world, without the Spirit of God.
    <br>You can have the largest church, congregation all over the world, without the Spirit of God.
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>You can have the largest church, without the Spirit of God.
    <br>The largest congregation; the crowd is not our strength.
    <br>Watch Emmanuel TV - it is the most watched channel, all over the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The most watched channel now - click it - all over the world.
    <br>But this is Ikotun Egbe, a very isolated city here.
    <br>But you find your way to come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Crowd - the largest church all over the world can be operating without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You can be the richest man of the world, without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You can be the most famous one, all over the world, without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our joy, our main reward is peace of heart.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>How many soldiers do you see here with guns?
    <br>Do you see barricades here?
    <br>Because I have so much peace of heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are supposed to be barricades here, because somebody can jump there.
    <br>Even ushers - I don't want them standing here - go your way,
    <br>because there is so much peace of heart.
    <br>If you send me over there, you are helping me - that is my home.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are just helping me; that is my home, this is where I want to be.
    <br>Sending me there is helping, it is not anything but helping me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What are we talking about?
    <br>All those things you see as a testimony of Holy Spirit, manifestation of Holy Spirit, this, that...
    <br>The testimony of the Holy Spirit is peace of heart.
    <br>Because you need that peace of heart, that is why you keep running.
    <br>You can't eat what you want to eat.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, I want to leave you here.
    <br>Bless you.
