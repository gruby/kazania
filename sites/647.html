    <br>They must obey!
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to open your lips and begin to speak to every spirit of infirmity.
    <br>Every spirit of destruction, every spirit that kills, steals, and destroys,
    <br>command them to leave!
    <br>They must obey!
    <br>Every knee shall bow,
    <br>Every tongue shall confess,
    <br>Jesus is Lord!
    <br>Confess it, confess it right now! Open your lips, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, every sickness, every hidden affliction
