  <p>    
    <br>We have heard, we have seen the power of God working in the Spirit,
    <br>the name of Jesus wrought miracles, working in the Spirit and
    <br>the anointing of God working in the Spirit.
    <br>I think it is your turn now.
    <br>It will work in your soul.
    <br>Let someone say: Draw me towards You.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Draw me towards You.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Draw me towards You.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>This means, whatever situation you are in, a demon is behind it.
    <br>Matthew 9:32 - "As they went out, behold, they brought to Him a man, mute".
    <br>He cannot just be mute; the cause of that is a demon.
    <br>They brought to Him a man, sick and demon-possessed.
    <br>Now in chapter 9 when you go to verse 33, "When the demon was cast out, the mute spoke".
    <br>Can you see what we are talking about?
    <br>That, when what was behind that was cast out, the mute man spoke.
    <br>When the demon was cast out, the man was healed, delivered and blessed.
    <br>FREE YOURSELF!!! Mass Prayer With Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>When Jesus met a man who could not speak because of a demon inside him,
    <br>when the demon was cast out, the man began to speak.
    <br>Right now, whatever situation you are facing -
    <br>sickness, disease, limitation in progress
    <br>or anything not mentioned, but God knows.
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in,
    <br>a demon is behind it,
    <br>a demon is responsible for it,
    <br>a demon is the cause of it.
    <br>I say to you, begin to free yourself!
    <br>Begin to talk to that demon.
    <br>Demon, I command you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>FREE YOURSELF!!! Mass Prayer With Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>Viewers, watch your screen.
    <br>See that man vomiting out poisonous substances.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, every constant experience you are having, be loosed!
    <br>You demon, I command you in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips!
    <br>Say: In the name of Jesus!
    <br>As the mass prayer is going on, viewers all over the world, anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Watch the screen of your television. See the mighty power of God working in the Spirit.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Ask God, draw me towards You.
    <br>Draw me towards You, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Draw me towards You!
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Draw me towards You!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever you might have eaten from the table of your enemy,
    <br>through dream that is causing you bad luck, backwardness,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to say to you,
    <br>your case has not escaped the anointing of God.
    <br>You are delivered!
    <br>You are set free!
    <br>You are disengaged from that bondage!
    <br>You are disengaged!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see you on the sickbed. Right now, I'm saying to you, begin to walk!
    <br>All the dry bones in your system - rise again!
    <br>Your business that you are complaining about - no more complaining!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Tell those who care to listen: I'm free!
    <br>I'm no longer condemned!
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past!
    <br>I'm justified!
    <br>I'm redeemed!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>You have not known the Lord, say after me:
    <br>Lord Jesus,
    <br>I'm a sinner.
    <br>Come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul today.
    <br>My Saviour.
    <br>My Redeemer.
    <br>Thank You for my salvation.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Let the people of God say:
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
