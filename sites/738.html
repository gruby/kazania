    <br>During the Super Friday Healing and Deliverance service at the SCOAN,
    <br>while Prophet T.B. Joshua was praying, a young man cried out.
    <br>SCOAN Healing & Deliverance Service
    <br>Come here. What did you say?
    <br>Two of them. This is my senior brother's daughter. Her father died in 2004.
    <br>This one is our last born. They killed my mother.
    <br>Who killed your mother?
    <br>The two of them. They have confessed that they have killed my mother.
    <br>Ok. If they confessed to you, can they confess to me?
    <br>Do you have any right to say that somebody is a witch?
    <br>You have been witnessing since morning when witches themselves said that they were witches
    <br>and they would demonstrate it
    <br>and if they were not, the Spirit of God would say: "No, they are not".
    <br>But it is not for you now to speak on their behalf.
    <br>Do not speak on their behalf saying that they are witches.
    <br>You can only say that they have problems, either sickness or disease
    <br>but for you to say that they are witches, are you a prophet?
    <br>I'm not.
    <br>How are you, my brother?
    <br>They are being tortured.
    <br>Psychological torture.
    <br>Your name?
    <br>Which school are you going to?
    <br>Primary school.
    <br>Do you understand what he is saying?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you? Do you understand what your brother is saying?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What is he saying?
    <br>He says that I'm a witch.
    <br>He said that you are a witch?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Are you a witch?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You are not a witch.
    <br>It's a torture.
    <br>He's afraid. You can hear the tone.
    <br>He said, "Yes".
    <br>He's not a witch.
    <br>Your brother said that you are a witch.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Are you a witch?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Do you want to hear from me?
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>I will pray for you people. These two are not witches.
    <br>I am the only person in our family that remains.
    <br>All my seniors have died.
    <br>I am the only person that can take care of them. They have rejected them.
    <br>Ok. Only you remain in the family?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Everybody else has died?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And you are the only person that is taking care of them?
    <br>Yes. We're three at home.
    <br>Ok, then I will join your family.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>Tell me, how do you want me to join?
    <br>Do you want to take me as your senior brother or your junior brother
    <br>or do you want to take me as your son?
    <br>As my father.
    <br>Ok. Jesus will be our father.
    <br>So, we will just be members of the family.
    <br>I want to see you and see what we can do to move the family forward.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>What are you doing for a living?
    <br>Somebody borrowed me money to sell recharge cards -
    <br>since my mother has gone.
    <br>Ok, someone borrowed you money to sell recharge cards.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And that is what you are doing?
    <br>Have you returned the money?
    <br>No.
    <br>You have not returned the money?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How much did the person borrow you?
    <br>He borrowed me 30,000 naira.
    <br>I borrowed some money and joined the money together and took them from Akwa Ibom to this place.
    <br>From which state are you?
    <br>Akwa Ibom.
    <br>They are not witches.
    <br>It is the situation in the house that makes everybody a witch or a wizard.
    <br>And the situation is so grave that if they grow big in the nearest future
    <br>and you people are not delivered today, they will call you a wizard.
    <br>Assume that you are in their position and they are in your position.
    <br>They too will call you wizard.
    <br>They are looking for where the problem is coming from
    <br>and anybody can be a scapegoat.
    <br>SCOAN Healing & Deliverance Service
    <br>Who is a witch now?
    <br>Who is a wizard?
    <br>You are free. You are all children of God.
    <br>Live at peace. Thank you.
    <br>SCOAN Healing & Deliverance Service
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for the three from Akwa Ibom state
    <br>and declared that the little boy and girl accused of witchcraft were innocent
    <br>and that they are all children of God.
    <br>On Sunday, during the live service, Prophet T.B. Joshua brought their alarming case
    <br>to the attention of the congregation.
    <br>Two weeks ago, there was a brother that was called out
    <br>who claimed that the two children were witches and wizards.
    <br>After that deliverance, we began to probe into the matter.
    <br>It was a horrible issue.
    <br>Let's hear from the brother.
    <br>My name is Asuquo Etim Okon. I'm from Akwo Ibom state.
    <br>I'm 23 years old.
    <br>Last Friday, I came here to attend the prayer line
    <br>because of these two children.
    <br>They accused them.
    <br>They said that they were the ones that killed my mom.
    <br>I then took them to the Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>When we were here at the prayer line, the man of God touched my brothers.
    <br>I then shouted, "Please help me, man of God, help my brothers".
    <br>They accused them, saying that they were witches.
    <br>The man of God told me that these children were not witches.
    <br>They said that these children were the ones that killed my mom.
    <br>My mother's corpse is on the ground.
    <br>They never buried my mother's corpse.
    <br>They didn't take her to the mortuary.
    <br>They embalmed my mother and kept her body in the house.
    <br>So, these children - my father sent them away.
    <br>They rejected us and we have nowhere to go - nowhere to live.
    <br>I struggled to get money to try and do my mother's burial.
    <br>There was no money.
    <br>So, my friends started to call me.
    <br>They said that since my father sent those ones out of the house,
    <br>they used to sleep under the transformer, in the rain.
    <br>You can look at their body now.
    <br>When you look at their bodies, you will see that these people used to sleep under the transformer.
    <br>So, when they called me, they said that I should go back to our village
    <br>because there is something that they used to give them -
    <br>if you are really a witch, when they give you that thing, you are going to eat it and you will die.
    <br>If you are not a witch, you will vomit it.
    <br>And if you are an enemy, when they give that thing to you, you will be able to pass through it and kill them.
    <br>So, I thought that if I did this thing for these children, especially this one -
    <br>before my senior brother died, he left him in my hands
    <br>and said that as I was the only person that remained, anywhere I would go I should go with this one.
    <br>I thought of this thing and borrowed money.
    <br>When I went to town and visited my uncle, I used to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I then planned and borrowed money everywhere to take them to this place.
    <br>That is why I am here.
    <br>My mother's dead body is on the ground since March
    <br>because they never burried my mom.
    <br>No one can buy a coffin to bury my mom.
    <br>I'm the only person that can take care of that.
    <br>I'm suffering. I'm jobless.
    <br>Did you listen to that? He said that his mother is late. The body is still ... where?
    <br>She's in the house. The body is not in the mortuary because there is no money
    <br>for me to take her to the mortuary.
    <br>The body is still inside the room?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So, they cannot carry the body to the mortuary?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Since when?
    <br>Since March.
    <br>This is my brother that used to light a lantern in that house in the evening
    <br>so that rats would not eat the dead body.
    <br>He said that this is the brother that lights lantern.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>In the house?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So, that rats will not eat the dead body?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>From which state?
    <br>Akwa Ibom.
    <br>So, I want those who have the heart for this situation to join me.
    <br>Those from Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>You come forward, and I will support you.
    <br>When they are going tomorrow, you can follow them to that community
    <br>and help them with whatever they need to do with the body,
    <br>if they still need more money to do the necessary and bury the woman
    <br>and restore this family back.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>They are too little.
    <br>So, no matter what we give, if we do not follow them to their community
    <br>and stand by as a family to support the boy, I don't think that we have done anything at all.
    <br>So, people from Akwa Ibom, I know that they are here, and they are ready to join me
    <br>to help this family.
    <br>Our Lord Jesus Christ will lead us.
    <br>Let's hear from the little boy that used to light the lamp.
    <br>Yes, I am the one that lights the lamp. When there is no light,
    <br>the rats will eat my mother. That's why every night, I used to light the lamp.
    <br>You have heard it from the younger brother.
    <br>He said he is the one that used to light the lamp every night when there is no light
    <br>so that the rats would not eat the corpse of the mother.
    <br>You mentioned that you borrowed 30,000 naira.
    <br>Give him 300,000 naira and 30,000 naira to go and pay the debt.
    <br>Give them six bags of rice.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>Let them know that these children are not witches
    <br>because they thought that these children were the ones who killed the mother.
    <br>There's nothing like that.
    <br>Take care of the home.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The sum of 300,000 naira as a cash gift.
    <br>It has been handed to the brother an additional 30,000 naira which is a debt owned by him.
    <br>He said that he used the money to buy recharge cards to take care of the brothers and sisters
    <br>that were accused of witchcraft.
    <br>They had accused them of being the ones responsible for the death of their mother.
    <br>The corpse of their mother is still right in their home,
    <br>and the brother has to put on lantern every evening
    <br>to chase away the rats so that the corpse of the mother would not be eaten by rats.
    <br>The man of God has given the sum of 300,000 naira as a cash gift to them,
    <br>and also 30,000 naira for him to pay back his debt.
    <br>Man of God, God bless you!
    <br>Such a horrible case.
    <br>Due to the statement brought by the allegation of witchcraft on their family
    <br>and lack of finances, the dead body of their mother has not been buried
    <br>but was kept in a room in the family house for the past six months.
    <br>Every night one of the children would enter the dead mother's room
    <br>and light a lantern in order to prevent rats from eating the corpse of their mother.
    <br>After they had stated their case,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave Asuquo and the family the sum of 300,000 naira, six bags of rice
    <br>and a Holy Bible to help take care of the family
    <br>and additional 30,000 naira to pay off the debt Asuquo owed.
    <br>Leaving The SCOAN, the Etim Okon family accompanied by the Emmanuel TV team
    <br>embarked on their journey to Akwa Ibom state on a mission to bury their late mother
    <br>whose corpse has been lying abandoned in a room for six long months
    <br>and to reconcile the feuding family, following allegations of witchcraft.
    <br>My name is Asuquo Etim Okon.
    <br>I'm from Akwa Ibom.
    <br>I'm 23 years old.
    <br>These are my brothers and sisters and our father and mother in the Lord.
    <br>The man of God (T.B. Joshua) has sent them to come with us
    <br>to our village for the burial of our mother.
    <br>My name is George Udoh.
    <br>The man of God selected us to accompany the children
    <br>to go and reconcile both families
    <br>so that we can do the burial of the mother
    <br>who died in March this year and up till now, has not been buried.
    <br>So, we thank T.B. Joshua for what he has done for Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Knowing that their journey would break the yoke of shame and separation within the Etim Okon family,
    <br>satan tried to disrupt the mission.
    <br>Due to adverse weather conditions and bad roads, the vehicle was stuck for almost three hours.
    <br>But as Christians, we know that hard times may test us but cannot destroy us.
    <br>Because the team was carrying out an assignment from God,
    <br>no matter what constituted the obstacles on their way,
    <br>they could not be stopped.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>After much effort, hard work and perseverance, the vehicle was freed
    <br>and the team continued on their journey, knowing that the road to their destination
    <br>would not be a bed of roses but God's grace was sufficient for whatever they faced.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>After a long journey, they finally arrived at the family's village in Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>The very place their dead mother's corpse was laid six months earlier in March,
    <br>and where the stigma of witchcraft had been attached to the family.
    <br>The elder son leads the team by foot into the village.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Later that night, the team went to the house where the corpse was laid.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>This is my father's compound.
    <br>This is the room my mother's corpse is laid.
    <br>Every evening, I used to come and light the lantern here, in this house.
    <br>I light the lantern because when there is no lantern, the rats will eat
    <br>the dead body. That is why I light the lantern every night.
    <br>And that is what you have come to do now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Here is the son who had the cruelling task of lighting a lamp in his late mother's room every night -
    <br>in an attempt to stop rats from eating the body.
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and may not be suitable for all viewers, especially children.
    <br>But please take note that it is for the glory of God.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Carrying out his daily task, the boy lights the lamp.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>The next day, the Emmanuel TV team returned to meet the whole family, including the father.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Where are we now?
    <br>My father's house.
    <br>So this is your father's compound?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Here we are in Akwa Ibom state with Asuquo Etim.
    <br>He said this is his father's compound.
    <br>We have come from The SCOAN - the team that the man of God sent with the evangelists -
    <br>to come for his mother's burial. He also complained to the man of God that
    <br>his mother's corpse lies in this very compound.
    <br>What is happening?
    <br>I am the owner of this house.
    <br>What is happening?
    <br>Mummy, we are coming from The SCOAN -
    <br>all the way from Lagos state.
    <br>These are the evangelists the man of God has sent to come with me for my mother's burial.
    <br>I am very happy; thank you.
    <br>She said that she is very glad and happy to see us.
    <br>This is my father's compound.
    <br>This is the room where my mother's corpse lies.
    <br>My mother's dead body is inside the room.
    <br>This is where my father lives. This is my father's parlour.
    <br>For how long has your mother's dead body been in this room?
    <br>For five to six months now.
    <br>Can you tell us, how did you manage to keep your mother's dead body
    <br>for the past five to six months in this room?
    <br>Because there is no money to bury her.
    <br>So what did you do before you could keep her in this room?
    <br>Did you do anything to her body before you could keep her in this room?
    <br>For five to six months?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What did you do? Tell us.
    <br>They embalmed her.
    <br>My brother used to light a lantern in the house.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because of rats. If there is no lantern inside the house, rats will disturb
    <br>the dead body. They would eat the dead body.
    <br>This is where my mother's corpse is.
    <br>It is inside.
    <br>This is where I used to come and light the lantern because if there is no light,
    <br>the rats would eat my mother's body.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>So, apart from you, no other person enters this room?
    <br>Nobody.
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and may not be suitable for all viewers, especially children.
    <br>But please take note, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>All the expenses are being paid for by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is my father and my step-mother - they are coming now.
    <br>Here comes the father of Asuquo - the man accused of killing his first wife
    <br>and initiating two of his children into witchcraft.
    <br>Why are all these people here?
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Father, we have brought good news to your house.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua sent these people from Lagos state
    <br>to follow me here because of the children that were accused of witchcraft.
    <br>They have come to let the community know that the children are not witches and wizards.
    <br>So, let them come with me and bury my late mother.
    <br>That is the reason I have brought them to come and see you.
    <br>Is this why you brought them? To come and help bury your late mother?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I am pleased; I am very happy.
    <br>After explaining to the father why the Emmanuel TV team had come to his house,
    <br>Asuquo proceeds to narrate their experiences at The SCOAN.
    <br>How Prophet T.B. Joshua had blessed them with the sum of 330,000 naira
    <br>and bags of rice upon hearing their ordeal.
    <br>He shows him evangelical items from the Church with Prophet T.B. Joshua's picture on them.
    <br>Let's hear what he has to say.
    <br>My name is Etim Okon Edem.
    <br>I am very glad for what my son has just said.
    <br>It makes me very happy.
    <br>They are all my children.
    <br>What I have to say concerning what the Prophet has said to my children
    <br>is that I am their father.
    <br>The witchcraft spirit they said that they are possessed with,
    <br>they said that I possessed my children with this witchcraft spirit.
    <br>I am prepared to follow my children to go to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to find out, whether I am the one who gave them the wizard spirit
    <br>or whether I have that wizard spirit.
    <br>I am very happy and at the same time these are my children.
    <br>Regarding the issue of witchcraft of which my children were accused,
    <br>I was not the one who accused my children.
    <br>I was accused of witchcraft and of being the one that possessed my children.
    <br>Now that my children have been vindicated of being witches and wizards,
    <br>I would also like to go and meet that man of God (Prophet T.B. Joshua)
    <br>so that he can also tell the whole world whether I am a wizard or not.
    <br>The late woman is my wife and these are the children she bore for me.
    <br>Five of the children are late and I'm left with five.
    <br>I am Mr Joe Edem.
    <br>I am a native of this land.
    <br>It happened exactly as Mr Etim said that he had been accused of witchcraft.
    <br>Because of that, they also accused Mr Etim of initiating his son
    <br>and this was taken to the market square.
    <br>On the action of the villagers, Mr Etim was beaten because of traditions we normally follow.
    <br>He was asked to give goats and drinks; however, there was no money.
    <br>He used his land just so that he could give these items.
    <br>Then, the next action was that the village gave an ultimatum for Mr Etim
    <br>to bury his wife and whatever concerns the burial, he would bear the full responsibility for that.
    <br>He did so.
    <br>They left the corpse of the wife with him.
    <br>They left the matter like this.
    <br>Even the child standing here, we beat him up severely in this village.
    <br>We were even about to kill him.
    <br>Because of that accusation, these children were driven out of the father's compound.
    <br>They faced a lot of hardship because when they entered someone's house,
    <br>they would pursue them out.
    <br>After some months, this one was accused of being a witch.
    <br>Then, the story became another thing entirely.
    <br>So, they were driven out.
    <br>Even the father - they called him to the village square again to fine, and so he did.
    <br>Mr Etim was accused of being the one that killed his wife
    <br>and that he joined hands with this little child standing here to kill his wife.
    <br>Because of that, they handed everything to him that he should bury his wife alone.
    <br>It was yesterday, about 5 pm that I heard the story of a team coming from Lagos
    <br>to bury this woman, that is why I came to see.
    <br>Now when I came here, I saw these two.
    <br>They introduced themselves to me as members of T.B. Joshua's church.
    <br>To say it in brief, I am extremely happy and I am glad because even in this our area,
    <br>nobody would have known this. Since the man of God (Prophet T.B. Joshua) has done this for the community,
    <br>we here in this community give thanks to the Almighty God.
    <br>Mr Joe Edem, a native of Akwa Ibom state, explained how Mr Etim had been accused
    <br>of wizardry after the death of his wife and was publicly beaten and stigmatised in the society.
    <br>Two of his children were subsequently accused of witchcraft, rejected by the community
    <br>and left to their own fate.
    <br>This is the house of the chief of Mr Etim's community.
    <br>Mr Etim has brought the Emmanuel TV team here to formally introduce them to the chief.
    <br>This is the chief of the community taking his seat at the front of the house.
    <br>They explained the reason for their coming was to reconcile the family with the community
    <br>and to seek permission to bury Mr Etim's wife.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>The Chief said that what Mr Etim said is true.
    <br>He was not even around when this problem started. He came and met it.
    <br>They said the man is a wizard and that he is the one that initated his
    <br>two children into that kingdom. The Chief wanted to settle the matter
    <br>but they refused 'til the whole thing scattered.
    <br>Exactly what he told you is what happened.
    <br>They even ordered, due to his stubbornness that
    <br>he should be flogged, and he was flogged.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>They gave him a fine that he was supposed to pay to the village
    <br>but he did not obey. He said that he had no money.
    <br>The villagers went to his house forcefully and brought out
    <br>two goats and slaughtered them for the villagers to eat.
    <br>They wanted to kill him.
    <br>So, now that we have come from the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the man of God has said those that were accused of being witches and wizards are innocent,
    <br>that they are not witches or wizards and that we should come with those children
    <br>to let the villagers know that they are not witches or wizards
    <br>and also to give their mother a befitting burial. What does the Chief have to say concerning this?
    <br>They gave him a fine that he was supposed to pay to the village
    <br>The Chief says he is sending his regards to the man of God
    <br>for what he has done to recondile the village and the family.
    <br>He is happy.
    <br>The Heavenly Father should give him more anointing, more grace to continue the good work of God.
    <br>We want to ask Mr Etim if he has any other thing he would like to say to the Chief
    <br>concerning the burial of his wife.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Now that the Chief has agreed that he should bury his wife, he wants to know
    <br>what the items are that they need to buy for the burial.
    <br>The Chief says that if the total amount of money is brought here,
    <br>he will buy everything, settle the villagers,
    <br>so that we can go ahead with the burial.
    <br>The total is 26,000 naira.
    <br>On behalf of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV team,
    <br>this is the money to buy the items that are needed for the final burial of the wife of Mr Etim Okon.
    <br>As the man of God has said that he is going to support Mr Okon's family to make sure
    <br>a befitting burial is given to his wife, this has commenced with this list that was given to us
    <br>by the Chief of this community and now we are handing over the cash to him
    <br>so that he can buy all these items
    <br>and a befitting burial can be given to the wife of Mr Okon in this community.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>He says that we are free to go ahead with the burial,
    <br>that he thanks us so much and
    <br>asks that we should send his regards to the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Having finalised the agreements concerning the burial of Mr Etim's wife,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV team present the Chief of this community
    <br>with two bags of rice as a gift from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thanking the Chief, the team respectfully take their leave.
    <br>Now, Mr Etim leads the Emmanuel TV team to the chief of the neighbouring community
    <br>who is also the father of his late wife.
    <br>The team comes down from the bus and approaches the house.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Mr Etim is telling his father-in-law that these people that have come with him
    <br>are the people the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, sent to come
    <br>and help him bury his wife.
    <br>So, as he is here now, the father-in-law should tell him all traditional rites
    <br>so that he will observe it.
    <br>He says his name is Chief Etim Willems.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>After agreeing to bury the deceased,
    <br>they discuss the items required for the burial as their tradition stands.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>The Chief says that if you will comply with him and give him all that he mentioned,
    <br>you are free to go ahead with the burial.
    <br>On behalf of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>we want to present the sum of 38,000 naira, which is the cash needed
    <br>to buy the items that were stated by the Chief for the final burial of Mr Etim Okon's wife.
    <br>So, Chief, thank you, sir.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>The Chief says that as you have given him what he requested,
    <br>you can carry on with the burial.
    <br>The Chief says that it is about five months now since their daughter died
    <br>and that there was no way for them to bury her.
    <br>He thanks God for this.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>The Chief says that he is very happy, and that there was no hope of this
    <br>but since the Lord has done this for him, he gives thanks to God.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team gives the Chief 38,000 naira
    <br>to pay for the burial rites of Mr Etim's wife.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent this team to this family
    <br>to inform them that those that were accused of being witches and wizards
    <br>are not witches and wizards
    <br>and also to give a befitting burial to their daughter who is the wife of Mr Etim Okon
    <br>who is sitting right here.
    <br>With the successful completion of the negotiation,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV team gives the Chief
    <br>the gift of two bags of rice on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He says you should go and tell the man of God that he is happy
    <br>about what he has done for this family. He prays that the blessings of God
    <br>should remain with him and God should extend his wisdom
    <br>so that he would continue to do that, in Jesus' name. Amen.
    <br>In order to give Mrs Aret a befitting burial,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV team made preparations to purchase a coffin.
    <br>Since the man of God has taken up the responsibility to
    <br>to give your mother a befitting burial, I think the first thing we should do now
    <br>is to get a coffin for her burial so do you have any one
    <br>that can help to go and get the coffin?
    <br>Yes, I have.
    <br>Can you call the person so that we can make preparations towards that?
    <br>We were just talking about his mother's burial
    <br>and we want someone to help us get a coffin and he has called you.
    <br>So, do you have any idea how much a coffin will cost?
    <br>The coffin is 30,000 naira. Together with the transportation, it is 36,000.
    <br>36,000 is for the coffin and the transportation?
    <br>For the coffin and the transportation.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>On behalf of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, and the Emmanuel TV team,
    <br>we are giving you the sum of 36,000 naira
    <br>as the cost for the transportation and the coffin to use in burying
    <br>the late mother of Asuquo and also the wife of Mr Etim.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has taken total responsibility for the funeral expenses.
    <br>He states that the total cost for the coffin, including transportation,
    <br>amounts to 36,000 naira,
    <br>which is promptly given to him by the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>Later that day...
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Here you can see the respectable coffin brought for the burial of Mrs Aret
    <br>whose corpse has been lying in a room for six months
    <br>due to insufficient funds for her funeral.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Here is the embalmed corpse - stiff and placed by the window -
    <br>as preparations are made to lower it into the coffin.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Following cultural traditions, they place Mrs Aret's most beautiful wears
    <br>into the coffin - her final resting place.
    <br>Just consider, if not for God's intervention, the dead body of Mrs Aret
    <br>would be left to a terrible fate.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Laying the corpse into the coffin, the family members of the deceased
    <br>continue to mourn - overcome with grief.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Closing the lid of the coffin, they prepare to move it to the church.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>As the rain falls, so do the tears of the grief-stricken family members.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Here is the funeral procession as the body of Mrs Aret embarks on its final journey,
    <br>heading for the local Apostolic Church.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>They finally arrive at the Apostolic Church where the funeral will take place.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>This is the photograph of Mrs Aret when she was alive.
    <br>A hard-working mother of ten of whom sadly only five remain today.
    <br>The long-awaited funeral service of Mrs Aret finally begins.
    <br>I will now call on another person to take the place 
    <br>of thanking God and committing this meeting to God.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>We want to recognise their presence here - the team of evangelists.
    <br>We would like to stand together and greet them as a team.
    <br>Emmanuel TV and the team of evangelists, you are welcome
    <br>in Jesus' name. Let us stand up and greet them.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>This is our calvary greeting at The SCOAN.
    <br>We bring greetings to all of you from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Brethren, I have a couple of things to tell you.
    <br>Up till now, God is using people to bless other people.
    <br>As we learn from the book of Genesis, God used Joseph to bless Potiphar.
    <br>But here in the land of Abia Limi, God is using the great man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, to bless the family of Etim Okon.
    <br>Are you still with me?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The man has never been here but the Spirit of God moved him to bless
    <br>the children of this land and the people of this land. Therefore, I have a couple
    <br>of things to tell you when it is time.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>There was no written biography. I will now call on somebody from the family
    <br>to come and say something about the sister lying before us here.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Praise the living God!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Children of God, praise the Lord!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>This was the only junior sister that I had.
    <br>I had two sisters - a junior sister and one elder sister, which is my senior sister.
    <br>My sister suffered a lot in her marital family.
    <br>It was full of trials and temptations.
    <br>My sister had the sickness that we call "Fire burns twice".
    <br>She had another sickness that removed two of her fingers.
    <br>My sister suffered a lot because of the trials in her marital family.
    <br>She gave birth to ten children. Then, the first five died;
    <br>only the last five are alive.
    <br>Because of that, there were problems in the family.
    <br>My sister then fell sick again.
    <br>Then my brother spent a lot of money on my sister.
    <br>He took her to thirteen places for healing; there was no way.
    <br>Later on, there was no more money.
    <br>Later, my sister gave up. That day, I was at Aba city (Nigeria).
    <br>My senior sister called me. Then I didn't know what to do.
    <br>Praise the living God!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>After five or six months, my sister's dead body was still on the ground,
    <br>with no preparations for burial. Then the Almighty God, the Ancient of days,
    <br>the Lion of Judah took the first of the living sons
    <br>to Lagos to meet with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Then the man of God helped us today and did everything
    <br>necessary to give my sister a befitting burial.
    <br>Today, I am so glad that I don't know what to say!
    <br>I really thank my God because He is great, the Author of the Universe.
    <br>I really thank God for the burial of my sister.
    <br>I thank God for T.B. Joshua and God will reward that man abundantly.
    <br>God will give him the grace to do more than this.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>God will give him showers of blessings and open ways for the man
    <br>and the people that accompanied my sister's children all the way from Lagos
    <br>down here to my village in Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>What you don't even expect, God has done it today.
    <br>That is why we used to say that if God has planned a better thing for you,
    <br>and there is no way for you to get that thing,
    <br>God must cause something to happen, so that
    <br>that thing must draw faster to you and you possess your possession.
    <br>Somebody shout, 'Hallelujah'!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>That is why God caused something to happen in that family
    <br>that took the son of this sister to Lagos.
    <br>Are you still with me?
    <br>This young man traced where the Prophet, the great man of God is.
    <br>He entered there and said, "God, will You open a way for me?"
    <br>God said, "I am the way, the truth and the life.
    <br>Nobody can see the Father, except by Me".
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The young man took a way to The SCOAN and
    <br>the man of God took him as his own son, not as a member of the church.
    <br>He took the responsibility of burying the mother
    <br>and also awarded the children with scholarships.
    <br>Is that not wonderful?
    <br>It is the doing of God; it is not a man's doing.
    <br>That is a great challenge to our lives.
    <br>If you want to do something for God, run fast and serve the living God.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We will stand here and pray for T.B. Joshua
    <br>for God to open more ways for him,
    <br>equip him, protect him, and preserve his life for us.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Prayer
    <br>After the funeral service, the people follow the coffin in procession
    <br>as the body is moved to its final resting place.
    <br>I know there is another
    <br>Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know there is another
    <br>Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know there is another
    <br>Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>I know there is another
    <br>Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know there is another
    <br>Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know there is another
    <br>Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know there is another
    <br>Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>I know there is another
    <br>Fellowship in Heaven
    <br>Overcome with emotion, Asuquo, the eldest son, cries out hysterically
    <br>as his late mother is about to be laid to rest in her grave.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Here is the son who daily entered the room where his dead mother's corpse lay
    <br>to light a lamp in order to deter rats from consuming the body.
    <br>Mr Etim looks on with a solemn expression on his face
    <br>as his wife's dead body is finally laid to rest.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>The coffin is lowered at long last into the grave.
    <br>A funeral song
    <br>As they begin to cover the coffin with soil,
    <br>the family, friends and well wishers bid their final farewell to Mrs Aret.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>With the burial of their mother over and having successfully reconciled
    <br>with the two communities to which they belong,
    <br>they embark on a long journey back to Lagos state and The SCOAN.
    <br>Accompanied by the Emmanuel TV team,
    <br>the family once again have boarded the bus.
    <br>This time, however, they are followed by Mr Etim.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>It is night time when the buses finally pull into The SCOAN's driveway.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>All the children take their seats.
    <br>Among the group is also the pastor who conducted their mother's funeral,
    <br>an elder from their village and members of The SCOAN from Akwo Ibom state.
    <br>Here we can see them climbing down from the bus
    <br>after a wearing journey.
    <br>Closely followed in the next bus by Mr Etim, their father.
    <br>He has been accused of wizardry, having been labelled as the one
    <br>who initiated his two youngest children,
    <br>which was said to have caused his wife's death.
    <br>Emmanuel! God is with us!
    <br>We thank the Lord Almighty for a successful journey to and from Akwa Ibom state,
    <br>which is the state of this family - the late woman's family that has been accused
    <br>of witches and wizards before they were vindicated on Sunday
    <br>when they came to The SCOAN.
    <br>After the service, they saw the man of God in his office
    <br>and he sent delegates of the Emmanuel TV team and others to follow them
    <br>to the village for the funeral of their late mother.
    <br>Now they are back here to The SCOAN.
    <br>We want to hear from our brother here, Mr Asuquo, who is the head of the family.
    <br>Can you come forward and let us hear from you.
    <br>You are welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Can you tell us your name and where you just arrived from?
    <br>My name is Mr Asuquo Etim Okon.
    <br>We are back from Akwa Ibom.
    <br>You just arrived from Akwa Ibom state?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Abiaje-Idibe in Orue Ottong / Oruko L.G.A. in Oron, Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>This is my father, Mr Etim Okon Edem.
    <br>This is my brother, Emmanuel Etim Okon. He is the one that used to
    <br>light a lantern over my mother's corpse.
    <br>This is my second brother, Emem Etim Okon.
    <br>This one is Lucy Etim Okon Edem.
    <br>This is my brother who was also accused of being a wizard.
    <br>His name is Etim Etim Okon.
    <br>This one is my mother's sister's son.
    <br>This is my mother's sister, Mrs Patience Edet.
    <br>This is one of the elders in our village.
    <br>This is the pastor that buried my mother.
    <br>These are the delegates from The SCOAN that followed us
    <br>to bury my mother.
    <br>How were you received in the village?
    <br>When we got there, we didn't see our father.
    <br>We went to my uncle's house and we explained to him
    <br>and he took us to the Chief's place. We explained everything to the Chief.
    <br>Later, when my father came back, we explained everything to him
    <br>and they all agreed.
    <br>We went to my mother's family and paid everything
    <br>we needed to pay for my mother's burial.
    <br>The whole village was happy; it made history in our village.
    <br>When people saw the team that the man of God sent to bury my mother,
    <br>everybody was happy. They wanted to follow us down here to Lagos
    <br>to meet with the man of God.
    <br>You mean the villagers were very happy and excited
    <br>that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, sent delegates
    <br>to go and meet all members of your family, including your father,
    <br>and also organise the funeral of your mother. Every villager was very happy?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Let us briefly hear from your dad.
    <br>Sir, can you tell us your name, age and where you come from.
    <br>My name is Mr Etim Okon Edem.
    <br>How old are you, sir?
    <br>I am 50 years old.
    <br>Can you tell us where you come from, sir.
    <br>I am from Abiage-Idibe in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A.
    <br>in Oron, Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>Can our father tell us who the people are next to him.
    <br>They are my children.
    <br>I was so happy to see my children in the company of the delegates that
    <br>were sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua. I was so happy because there was 
    <br>no hope for me to bury my dead wife, who was in the room where I live
    <br>the same compound. The Chief of the village was so happy.
    <br>The entire village was so happy, and they send their greetings
    <br>to the man of God.
    <br>The reason why my wife was not buried was that I had no money.
    <br>Even when I was looking for someone to buy my land in order to get money
    <br>for her burial, no one would buy the land.
    <br>We thank God Almighty that the late wife has been buried successfully
    <br>and they are here to give thanks to God for this successful burial
    <br>and successful journey from Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>We want to ask our father briefly: Is there any other reason
    <br>why he has come to The SCOAN?
    <br>The villagers accused me that I am a wizard and that I initiated
    <br>my children into the witchcraft world. I came here so that
    <br>the man of God will tell the world if I am a wizard or not.
    <br>The man said the villagers accused him of being a wizard.
    <br>They said the man initiated his own children into the witchcraft world.
    <br>As he has come, he wants the man of God to prove if he, Mr Etim, is a wizard or not.
    <br>We thank God for your life.
    <br>Can you tell us briefly what you have to say, your name, and what happened in the village.
    <br>My name is Emmanuel Etim Okon.
    <br>I come from Orue-Offong L.G.A. Aka Ibom.
    <br>The man sitting at that extreme, who is he to you?
    <br>He is my father.
    <br>Where you the one that used to light lantern
    <br>over the corpse of your mother before now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Before now, each time you see your mother's corpse inside the room
    <br>and you are lighting a lantern that rats would not eat the body of your mother,
    <br>how did you use to feel then?
    <br>I was not happy because there was no money to bury my mother.
    <br>Now that the man of God has sent delegates to bury your mother
    <br>and sponsored everything - buying the coffin and everything,
    <br>how do you feel?
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>It is time now to hear from the very sister of the late woman.
    <br>Our sister, we welcome you to The SCOAN, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Can you tell us your name and where you come from.
    <br>My name is Patience Asoqor Ayam.
    <br>Thank you very much, Ma. Can you tell us who you are to this family and to the late woman.
    <br>The late woman is my sister.
    <br>The man sitting over there is her husband.
    <br>Can you tell us what you have to say, having realised that the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, had sent delegates to go to the village
    <br>and bury your late sister. How do you feel?
    <br>I feel very happy and I am here today to testify to what happened
    <br>in the village, and I thank T.B. Joshua for sending some delegates to
    <br>Akwa Ibom state to come and bury my sister. I am very glad and happy.
    <br>Can you tell us how long your late sister's corpse was kept in the room.
    <br>It was five to six months.
    <br>Why wasn't she buried? What happened?
    <br>Her husband had no money for the burial because in our tradition,
    <br>the husband must bury the wife and do all the traditional rights.
    <br>That was the reason.
    <br>This was the reason why you people decided
    <br>to keep the corpse in the room for six months?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You are happy that the body is buried?
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>To God be the glory! Thank you very much.
    <br>Can we hear from the pastor who presided over the burial.
    <br>My name is Pastor J.A. Akpan. I come from Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>The night before yesterday, Prophet T.B. Joshua sent the team
    <br>for the burial arrangements to be made.
    <br>They came to me that the man of God said that I should conduct the burial.
    <br>I said, "Wow, did he know this woman before?"
    <br>They said, "No". What a great love!
    <br>He has never been there before, but the man of God took upon himself
    <br>the whole responsibility of burying the sister. I was so glad and happy
    <br>and I called my elders and told them. They were happy to join me.
    <br>The whole district joined together, and we buried the sister successfully.
    <br>That is why I am here for the first time to come and greet the man of God
    <br>and also have a spiritual talk with him.
    <br>Glory be to God. Amen.
    <br>Can we hear from one of the villagers who actually witnessed the whole incident.
    <br>I am Joe Edem.
    <br>I am a native of Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko 
    <br>where the woman died. The people here with me are from my village.
    <br>The man sitting there is Mr Etim Okon, the husband to the deceased.
    <br>The woman died about six months ago. Then, the husband was accused
    <br>that he was responsible for the death of his wife.
    <br>The whole village also accused the man that he initiated his children.
    <br>Because of this, the little money the man had all went because of
    <br>observing traditional rights. Anyone accused of being
    <br>a witch or wizard in our area, you will pay whatever you are told to pay,
    <br>otherwise, you will face the penalty.
    <br>After the man spent his money, he was financially handicapped.
    <br>There was no way he could bury his late wife.
    <br>All of a sudden, the children went out.
    <br>One fine day, I saw the young man coming with the team from
    <br>the man of God. They told me the men are from The SCOAN.
    <br>They did very well. All that we were supposed to do,
    <br>the church people helped us to do it. When I calculated
    <br>what the man of God did, I estimated it to be at least one million naira.
    <br>That is why I said I must come here to say thank you to the man of God
    <br>and to the whole church and to God Almighty for making
    <br>the burial of our wife a huge success. To God be the glory, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>After the man of God gave us 330,000 naira and six bags of rice,
    <br>he promised to send people to accompany us to the village
    <br>to bury my mother. I am so happy.
    <br>We bought a very nice casket to bury my mother. They filmed my mother.
    <br>People were very happy. I was very happy.
    <br>This thanksgiving will not finish this year. I will still continue to thank God
    <br>for what He has done in our lives because this is history in our village.
    <br>My mother has been buried.
    <br>People thought that my mother would not have a grave.
    <br>Today, my mother has a grave. I thank God for what Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>has done in my family. I praise God. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>We want to listen to the family. Let them come out
    <br>and let us hear a word from them.
    <br>This is the Etim family from Akwa Ibom, Nigeria
    <br>returning to The SCOAN one week after Prophet T.B. Joshua has sent his team
    <br>to perform the burial rights for their mother -
    <br>the woman who because of false accusations of witchcraft
    <br>had remained unburied for the past six months.
    <br>Let us listen as they give thanks to God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>My name is Asuquo Etim Okon.
    <br>I am from Akwa Ibom - Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A.
    <br>I'm 23 years old.
    <br>Here is our father, the one that gave birth to us.
    <br>His name is Mr Etim Okon Edem.
    <br>That's my brother, Emmanuel Etim Okon -
    <br>the one that used to light a lantern in my mother's room.
    <br>This very one is my brother, Amen Etim Okon.
    <br>This one is our first daughter, Lucy Etim Okon.
    <br>These ones are the children they accused of being witches and wizards.
    <br>This one is Lucy Okon Etim, my senior brother's daughter.
    <br>This is our last born, Etim Okon Edem.
    <br>This one is my mother's sister's son.
    <br>You can see my mother's sister here.
    <br>And one man from our village has come to testify of what Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>has done in our village, and our pastor that gave a befittig burial to my mum.
    <br>My fathers and my sisters in the Lord, they are from Akwa Ibom.
    <br>They were sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to escort us to Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>I want to thank God for what the man of God has done in our lives.
    <br>I was here two weeks ago because of these little ones.
    <br>They were accused in the village for being witches and wizards.
    <br>When I was here in the prayer line, I saw it as an opportunity to talk with
    <br>the man of God. I then shouted, "Man of God, help me. Help these children.
    <br>They accused them of being witches. They say that they are the ones
    <br>that killed my mother".
    <br>The man of God then said that these children are not witches.
    <br>I am happy to hear what the man of God has said.
    <br>The man of God promised to join our family.
    <br>The Sunday we were here, I told the man of God that due to this problem,
    <br>my mother's dead body was on the ground and she was not buried.
    <br>I told the man of God that there was no money to take her to the mortuary,
    <br>they embalmed her and kept her in the house.
    <br>This is my brother that used to light a lantern in the house
    <br>where my mother's dead body was kept.
    <br>When I explained everything to the man of God, the man of God then
    <br>gave us the sum of 330,000 naira and six bags of rice.
    <br>Later, the man of God promised to give these children scholarships
    <br>and he sent a team and evangelists to go with us to Akwa Ibom to bury my mum.
    <br>So, I want to stand here and thank the man of God
    <br>for what he has done in our village.
    <br>The rumours were carried everywhere about what
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has done in our family.
    <br>Now, my mother is buried.
    <br>People thought that my mother would not have a grave.
    <br>Today, with the help of T.B. Joshua, my mother has a grave.
    <br>I thank God for that.
    <br>This is the money that I'm talking about.
    <br>I never spent any of this money.
    <br>When we were about to go to the burial, he also gave us extra 20 bags of rice.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>People have been calling me. Even when I was inside the vehicle,
    <br>I received many calls. They said that there was no burial in our village that
    <br>would look like my mother's burial.
    <br>I thank the man of God for what he has done in our family.
    <br>Right now, we are going to listen to their father, Mr Etim Okon.
    <br>He is going to speak in their local dialect which will be translated
    <br>for us into English. Let us listen to him.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>My name is Etim Okon Edem.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>I am from Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A., Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>I was accused of being a wizard. Then, the villagers stoned and tortured me
    <br>and abandoned the corpse of my wife, saying that I should be taking
    <br>care of her until they bury her.
    <br>There was no hope of burying my wife.
    <br>The Lord took my children to The SCOAN,
    <br>where they met the man of God called Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The children explained the situation to him and what they were facing.
    <br>The man of God helped them.
    <br>In the village, I saw people I did not know before,
    <br>coming to me with my children.
    <br>They explained, "Man, rejoice, we want to bury your wife for you".
    <br>Really, I was still doubting. Then all of a sudden I said, "I agree with you people".
    <br>And they helped me. They did everything successfully.
    <br>That is why I am here.
    <br>I am also here so that the man of God will look at me and see
    <br>if I am a wizard. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>I suffered for about 11 years because of my wife's issues. Finally she died.
    <br>And the Lord proved Himself beyond human expectations.
    <br>As I'm here, as I said earlier, I want the man of God
    <br>to look at me very well to confirm if the accusation is true or not.
    <br>That is what the man said.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Mrs Patience Asuquo Edet.
    <br>I am from Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>These are my sister's children, and this is my sister's husband.
    <br>This is the villagers' representative
    <br>and these are delegates from Lagos that Prophet T.B. Joshua sent to us.
    <br>Today, I am very happy for what God has done for me.
    <br>God has made impossibilities possible to us.
    <br>In our tradition, when a lady marries into a family,
    <br>when she dies, the husband takes responsibility for her burial.
    <br>My sister's husband doesn't even have 10 kobo to do that
    <br>because of the traditional rites surrounding the case.
    <br>But God Almighty led our son to Lagos to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua became part of our family.
    <br>He helped us by giving my sister a befitting burial.
    <br>I really thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and I ask God to reward him abundantly
    <br>and the delegates he sent from Lagos to join us for my sister's burial.
    <br>Now, I am very happy.
    <br>I say, Prophet T.B. Joshua, remain blessed in Jesus' name.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>I am the pastor officiating the burial of our late sister.
    <br>My name is Pastor G.E. Akpan, of the Apostolic Church.
    <br>I was transferred newly to that place.
    <br>I didn't even believe that God is still using people to bless many people.
    <br>Now, I see and know that what the Scriptures have said already
    <br>is fulfilled in the family of Mr Etim.
    <br>I did not know that such a sister had died,
    <br>until I saw a team of evangelists from The SCOAN
    <br>sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to pay all the rites
    <br>for the family of the deceased and for the married family too.
    <br>Later on, they came to me in the church, that such a thing had happened.
    <br>Since they mentioned the name of this prophet, I had no option
    <br>than to rise up and tell the Elders that we have a burial tomorrow morning
    <br>and none of them argued.
    <br>They told me everything, that such a sister had died. There was no hope
    <br>of burying her and now God has brought hope.
    <br>We joined hands together and gave her a befitting burial.
    <br>That is why I am here myself, to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for what he has done for the family of Mr Etim Okon
    <br>and the entire village of Abiaje-Idibe.
    <br>May God bless him; may God keep him.
    <br>May God extend his life for this nation and the entire world at large.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Mr Joe Edem.
    <br>I am from Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A., Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>I am from the same village as Mr Etim Okon.
    <br>I knew right from the beginning the problem Mr Etim was facing
    <br>because of the sickness and death of his wife.
    <br>The whole thing started as narrated.
    <br>In our tradition, when you are accused of witchcraft,
    <br>there is a certain thing you must do before entering the midst of people.
    <br>Failing to do that, you will be punished.
    <br>The whole thing bounced back on Mr Etim.
    <br>Mr Etim was accused of being a wizard, that he initiated his two children
    <br>and that he killed his wife.
    <br>And he was asked to take the responsibility as traditions demand.
    <br>Then, Mr Etim was tortured by the villagers.
    <br>Finally, they abandoned the corpse of his wife with him
    <br>to take care, while he was penniless.
    <br>The children ran away from the village. We did not know where they went.
    <br>The last time I saw them they were sleeping here and there
    <br>because nobody allowed them to enter their house in the village.
    <br>Then one day I heard the news
    <br>that the son has come with a team of the man of God to bury their mother.
    <br>I went there as a villager and I witnessed everything.
    <br>I said I would come here to testify to the glory of God
    <br>what the Lord has one in my village and in the family of Mr Etim Okon.
    <br>That is why I am here.
    <br>A huge amount of money was spent on the burial.
    <br>If I am to estimate, it would be about 1 million naira.
    <br>To God be the glory in Jesus' name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>You have listened.
    <br>I know that when they mentioned 1 million naira, you were making noise.
    <br>Can 1 million buy peace?
    <br>Joy?
    <br>There's no amount of money that can buy joy.
    <br>That joy that is restored in the family.
    <br>He just mentioned 1 million. It is a small thing.
    <br>We thank God that we got to the root.
    <br>When you look at what you will spend, you will not be able to pursue that joy.
    <br>Look at the little children.
    <br>For them to start facing this kind of trouble at this age.
    <br>Sleeping on the street.
    <br>Look at the father, the husband of the woman.
    <br>I'm just looking at him now; he's not a wizard.
    <br>He just needs to accept Jesus as his Lord and Saviour.
    <br>He's not a wizard. He's not responsible for the death.
    <br>Can you imagine. That frustration and depression is enough to kill this man.
    <br>Look at him. He looks like a school boy - it's poverty, suffering.
    <br>You cannot believe that he is a father.
    <br>Look at his body. It is trouble that made him as if he wants to disappear.
    <br>Now, this trouble is removed. Give him two months and see how the body will look then.
    <br>This is to tell you what the Lord has done for them.
    <br>God has brought joy and peace to the home.
    <br>How are you, sir?
    <br>I am fine. Thank you.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>I am Mr Etim Okon.
    <br>I am happy that the man of God said that I am not a wizard and that
    <br>my children are not wizards. To God be the glory in Jesus' name!
    <br>He should learn to forgive and forget the past.
    <br>Whoever accused him of being a wizard, he should forgive and forget.
    <br>Because God has forgiven him, he should also forgive everyone
    <br>and see everyone as one. He should not look back.
    <br>The pain in the past is past.
    <br>The Lord is bringing joy - wonderful joy to the home.
    <br>He should not ever begin to think or look back at those
    <br>who called him a wizard.
    <br>Having them in mind or beginning to retaliate, the punishment will be great.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>From today, I have forgiven those that accused me of being a wizard.
    <br>As God has forgiven me, I have forgiven them.
    <br>I will not think anything bad against them again.
    <br>Like I have said right from the beginning of the meeting,
    <br>our outward quality, our attitude, our behaviours -
    <br>sometimes people look at it and say, "Ah, he is a wizard. He is the cause".
    <br>I need to counsel him. He needs deliverance.
    <br>But that does not mean that he is a wizard. He is not a wizard.
    <br>He has some bad attitude towards people.
    <br>People now look at it as if he is a wizard. He is not.
    <br>Everybody has his weakness.
    <br>He has that weakness. But it does not mean he is a wizard.
    <br>And the children. Most especially the brother that used to put a lamp every night.
    <br>He is the only person that was doing this?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You need to be delivered.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>Because I'm seeing the spirit of death.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out! In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Can you see the manifestation? Can you see him?
    <br>Can you see - this is coming out of him.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>He's changing body. He's transforming.
    <br>Look at the body.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>He's transforming.
    <br>You can see the movement.
    <br>Do you see?
    <br>He's transforming from one form to another.
    <br>His normal self. Because the spirit of death is over him.
    <br>He began to eat with the dead; death is around him.
    <br>If he is not delivered, they just want him to get out of the church
    <br>and when he goes out there, he will just find himself in the midst of death.
    <br>He has the spirit of death.
    <br>That is just the repercussion.
    <br>Because it was his mum, does not mean the death does not know the children.
    <br>Once they die, they die. There is nothing like relation.
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>He is getting off.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>It is gone.
    <br>He cannot stand straight; there is no body.
    <br>I just want you to know what I am talking about that
    <br>he is transforming from one form to another.
    <br>That is why I carried him up.
    <br>He is transforming. His real self - it is just standing here.
    <br>He spent almost five and a half months with the dead.
    <br>For five months, he alone was the one.
    <br>He would enter there, do everything. He has become part of them.
    <br>When he is finished, the whole thing will be off. He will become a normal person.
    <br>Unlike before, when he slept, he slept with them.
    <br>In the night, even during the day, when he stands like this,
    <br>he would see people walking on their heads.
    <br>This is exactly the repercussion.
    <br>But he did it because he is a small boy. He didn't see anything wrong with it.
    <br>If they leave him to become bigger,
    <br>the next thing is that he would turn to a witchdoctor.
    <br>And he would be seeing things.
    <br>He could begin to consult them because he would have a good relationship with them.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>This man is not a wizard. But this one possessed dead spirits.
    <br>He's not a wizard. He's just naturally stubborn. He just needs to accept God.
    <br>So, the brother is free.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>We have come together to support these children, let them go back to school
    <br>and whatever we can do to give to their father.
    <br>We thank God for what the Lord has achieved.
    <br>There was 300,000 naira given to the family.
    <br>Come, boy.
    <br>Because they had to go back to the village,
    <br>330,000 naira was given to the brother to pay the debt. Apart from the funeral
    <br>they have done, give them 200,000 naira making 530,000 naira
    <br>so that the children will go back to school and they should take care
    <br>of the family. The father should have a better place to stay.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>I am happy for what the man of God has done for me.
    <br>I give God the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
    <br>The children should go to school.
    <br>There is a purpose for this thing to happen today.
    <br>The occasion that happened today.
    <br>It means there is a hero, God's general, among these children.
    <br>God just wants this record.
    <br>This is history. You have to be part of the history.
    <br>So, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Because it is time to celebrate.
    <br>Celebrate Jesus celebrate
    <br>Put your hands together. Come on.
    <br>Celebrate Jesus celebrate
    <br>Come on and celebrate.
    <br>Celebrate Jesus celebrate
    <br>He is risen
    <br>And He lives forevermore
    <br>He is risen
    <br>Come on and celebrate
    <br>The resurrection of the Lord
    <br>Come on and celebrate
    <br>Celebrate Jesus celebrate
    <br>He is risen
    <br>And He lives forevermore
    <br>He is risen
    <br>Come on and celebrate
    <br>The resurrection of the Lord
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you. Thank you very much.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>The father is going to speak in one of the Nigerian languages
    <br>and we have someone here who is going to translate
    <br>into English for us to understand.
    <br>So, we want him to start his testimony by telling us his name
    <br>and what God Almighty has done in his life today.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>The man said he is Mr Etim Okon.
    <br>He is from a village called Abiaje-Idibe in Orue-Offong / Oruko L.G.A., Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>There was something that happened to him. His wife fell sick and she died.
    <br>Then, the family scattered because he was accused of being a wizard.
    <br>They said that he initiated his children into the witchcraft world.
    <br>Because of this, he 'saw hell' - a lot of torture and he spent all that he had.
    <br>So, there was nothing left with him to do the burial as demanded.
    <br>All of a sudden, the children left him.
    <br>One day when he was in his house, he saw his children coming with a team
    <br>sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to his village.
    <br>They explained that they had come to give his late wife a befitting burial.
    <br>He jumped up and down and was so happy.
    <br>The burial was conducted. After that, he decided to come to
    <br>The SCOAN to see Prophet T.B. Joshua so he would
    <br>know if he was a wizard as alleged by the villagers.
    <br>That is why he is here.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>This kind of thing has never happened in our area.
    <br>This is the first time of seeing someone who is not from his village, not even
    <br>from his state - giving such help to somebody.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>I am very happy as the man of God looked at me and confirmed that
    <br>I am not a wizard.
    <br>I will go back joyfully to my village so thank God.
    <br>WICKED! Children Confess To Killing Their MUM Through Witchcraft!!!
    <br>The man of God gave me 200,000 naira and a Holy Bible.
    <br>With this, I will continue to thank God for what God has done for me and
    <br>my family. To God be the glory.
    <br>I am Mr Joe Edem.
    <br>I am a native of Abiaje-Idibe village in Orue-Offong / Oruko -
    <br>the same village as Mr Etim Okon.
    <br>For some years now, he has not been together with his children because
    <br>of the problem of the sickness of his wife.
    <br>After some time, his wife died and the problem continued.
    <br>Because of this problem of being accused of being a wizard and
    <br>initiating his children into the world of witchcraft, the man 'saw hell'.
    <br>I witnessed it because I am from that place.
    <br>When there was no hope, the Lord Jesus appeared
    <br>and exactly what the other people have said happened in the life of Mr Etim.
    <br>God used Prophet T.B. Joshua of The SCOAN to
    <br>intervene in the problem they had in their family.
    <br>Now, his son can see his father as a father and talk to him but before,
    <br>it wasn't like that. Now that God has joined them together, I am very happy.
    <br>To God be the glory. In Jesus' name. Amen.
    <br>Let us listen to the pastor who officiated the burial ceremony
    <br>of Mr Etim Okon's wife.
    <br>My name is Pastor J.A. Akpan.
    <br>I am a resident pastor in Orue-Offong / Oruko, Akwa Ibom state.
    <br>I am the person officiating this burial.
    <br>I have never been here before but something led me to The SCOAN.
    <br>Having seen a team of evangelists coming to me,
    <br>saying that they were sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to pay for the burial of the
    <br>sister who died in my district, I was amazed and I asked if he knew
    <br>this woman before. They said, "No". I said, "How could this happen?"
    <br>They said, "It is the grace of God".
    <br>They paid all the rights. I called one of the elders there and asked.
    <br>He told me that since there was no hope of burying the sister quickly,
    <br>there was no need to tell me that such a thing had happened.
    <br>I thank God because God used the man of God to intervene
    <br>and do the burial. To God be the glory.
    <br>As Joshua said that as for him and his family, they will serve the Lord,
    <br>we want to tell everyone of you, most especially your father,
    <br>that he should see to it to train you all in the way of the Lord and
    <br>we pray that God Almighty will grant him the inner grace to do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>It shall be permanent
    <br>What the Lord has done for us
    <br>It shall be permanent
    <br>Emmanuel!
