  <p>    
    <br>Come on, brother.
    <br>You have a problem with your wife.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Your wife wants to leave you.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Augustine Igbinovia.
    <br>I'm from Edo State, Nigeria, but I reside in South Africa.
    <br>Last week Sunday. I was inside this church, sitting by this side
    <br>when the man of God called me out and prophesied that I have a problem in my marriage.
    <br>I confirm that prophecy to be a hundred percent true.
    <br>I have a problem in my marriage as a result of unfaithfulness due to the spirit of lust.
    <br>I have been unfaithful to my wife.
    <br>I indulged myself in communicating on social media via my phone.
    <br>At the beginning, I didn't go outside.
    <br>My wife was suspecting me because I was always on my phone.
    <br>As the result of the spirit of lust, I developed the spirit of anger.
    <br>Any time my wife accused me of doing something that I was not supposed to do in the marriage,
    <br>I ended up being angry. And most of the times I'd beat her up and she'd call the cops on me.
    <br>The spirit of lust entered me after I got married.
    <br>The spirit of lust entered me through communicating on social media.
    <br>My wife was unhappy. The spirit of lust caused me to beat my wife on two occations.
    <br>On the third time, she called the police, and I was given a protection order for me not to come close to her.
    <br>We have been separated for eight months now.
    <br>This is the letter of the protection order,
    <br>and this is my divorce summon, issued to me by my wife's lawyer.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>After the problems in my marriage, my wife told me to go to The SCOAN.
    <br>Until I got my deliverance, or until the man of God invited her, the marriage would be over.
    <br>Man of God, most of the time, I reacted towards my wife with anger which was due to my past relationship.
    <br>I had a 10-year relationship prior to this marriage - with a lady I was supposed to get married to.
    <br>Despite everything I did for her...
    <br>Your wife has how many children for you?
    <br>One, sir. One daughter, sir.
    <br>I think they are here now. Let her come out.
    <br>The more he talks, the more he provokes the Spirit of God.
    <br>It's better we do not hear from you.

    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>I want to thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After the deliverance here on Sunday and listening to what he was saying,
    <br>I realised that there was a need for me to give a call to our sister.
    <br>I had to call her. I was the one who spoke with you.
    <br>Thank you for honouring this call.
    <br>Thank you, Sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She knows what it means to marry and what marriage means.
    <br>She is a godly person.
    <br>No matter what happened, we need to know God's opinion. That is why she is here.
    <br>Not that there's a special thing in you. You just have that zeal for God.
    <br>Marriage is not a hobby.
    <br>This is a relationship.
    <br>We need to meet the father of relationship - God -
    <br>for whatever happened in a relationship. That is why she is here.
    <br>My sister, this is a marriage from God.
    <br>I want to assure you. After the meeting here, I will sit with you people.
    <br>He will write a note. He will sign.
    <br>He is a bad bad boy. That's all. I will not say more than that. He is a bad boy.
    <br>God says, Give him another try. Simple.
    <br>He's a bad boy, but that boy has been delivered.
    <br>He can still go back to being bad because you have your life.
    <br>There is nothing we can do.
    <br>God has delivered you. You can still choose to go back to that bad life.
    <br>But he is a bad boy. I will not say more than that.
    <br>So, thank you very much, my daughter.
    <br>After the meeting, I'm going to meet you.
    <br>Don't bother to say anything. Anything you say will scatter our reconciliation.
    <br>We don't want to hear anything.
    <br>Please give thanks to God. God says you should give him another chance.
    <br>So give him another chance.
    <br>I will not say...
    <br>This is the presence of God.
    <br>I will not stand here and because I'm a Nigerian and you are a Nigerian, I will begin to say...
    <br>We are saying the mind of God.
    <br>Give thanks to God: "God, we thank You for giving me another chance".
    <br>Give this man another chance.
    <br>Thank Him because of your wonderful child.
    <br>Thank you.

    <br>My name is Mpho Igbinovia.
    <br>I'm a banker by profession. I'm from South Africa.
    <br>I would like to thank the man of God for his words.
    <br>I'd also like to thank him for inviting me here.
    <br>He provided everything - from the ticket to fly here, the accommodation, and the food.
    <br>Thank you very much, Man of God. I will honour your words as I have always done. Thank you, Sir.
    <br>You can give thanks to God for giving you another chance.
    <br>Man of God, I want to say thank you for reconciling my marriage
    <br>and for letting God use you to give me another chance in my marriage.
    <br>I promise never to go back to my old ways.
    <br>Okay. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Can you just...
    <br>Mr & Mrs Augustine Igbinovia
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>You will see that he is the one that hates to do that.

    <br>Thank you very much. Thank you, my daughter. Thank you. Thank you very much.
    <br>Standard for Life
    <br>My name is Augustine Igbinovia.
    <br>I'm a Nigerian from Edo State, residing in South Africa.
    <br>The lady beside me is my lovely wife, Mrs Mpho Igbinovia from South Africa.
    <br>You're welcome, Sir. Can you just tell us - since you're coming to The SCOAN,
    <br>what God Almighty has done for you, especially in the area of your marriage.
    <br>I want to first thank God and thank Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for reconciling my marriage and bringing back peace to my home.
    <br>I'm the one the man of God prophesied about who had a problem in his marriage due to the spirit of lust.
    <br>I want to say, Thank You, God and thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>for bringing back peace to my home and restoring my marriage.
    <br>The man of God said that I have a lovely wife.
    <br>He also said that I should make sure not to go back to my old ways.
    <br>He asked me to write an undertaking that I have written to the man of God, stating my promise to him.
    <br>This is my promise, undertaking letter to God and to the man of God as well
    <br>that I'll never go back to my old ways.
    <br>I read: I, Augustine Igbinovia, 32 years of age, from Edo State, Nigeria,
    <br>would like to thank the man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua for reconciling my marriage.
    <br>And I promise God and him that I will never go back to all the bad and negative ways I have been living my life.
    <br>And I want God to give me the grace and strength to keep my promise in Jesus' name.
    <br>This letter was signed by me on the 14th of March 2017 at 12:24 am.
    <br>This is an undertaking that the man of God has asked me to write,
    <br>stating that I promise never to go back to my old ways.
    <br>And if I go against what I've written here, whatever happens is left for me to answer.
    <br>We give glory to God that you are here today with your wife at The SCOAN.
    <br>So since the word of prophecy you received last week during the prayer,
    <br>can you just tell us the changes you've witnessed in your life?
    <br>I can say that I have found total peace.
    <br>Since Sunday, I've found peace with myself.
    <br>The spirit of lust totally left me.
    <br>How do you know that the spirit of lust has left you?
    <br>I know because before, whenever I saw a lady, I'd lust after her.
    <br>But since my deliverance and the prophecy from the man of God,
    <br>I no longer feel that way anymore, and the spirit of lust has left me.
    <br>You're standing next to your wife now. What do you want to say to her?
    <br>I want to apologise to my wife for the wrong things I have done in the past.
    <br>I promise to stay faithful to her in this marriage
    <br>And I promise to love her like never before.
    <br>My name is Mpho Igbinovia from South Africa.
    <br>The man standing next to me is my wonderful husband.
    <br>The man of God told me that I and my husband need to stay steadfast in prayer.
    <br>He told me that I need to monitor him as a wife, to make sure that he doesn't go back to his old ways.
    <br>We saw your husband reading an undertaking,
    <br>confirming that he has promised God not to return to his past. What can you say?
    <br>I accept the undertaking and I thank the man of God for making him understand
    <br>the importance of him following what he should or shouldn't do.
    <br>I'm very happy and pleased
    <br>and I pray that God strengthens him so that he will not go back to his old ways.
    <br>Amen. We thank Jesus Christ.
    <br>Just in the little time you've been in here in The SCOAN,
    <br>what are the the changes that you've witnessed just in this short time?
    <br>My husband is more laughing now. Just like it was in the beginning.
    <br>He is showing love to both me and his family as well.
    <br>So, I can surely say that slowly but surely he is showing the signs that he has changed.
    <br>We thank Jesus Christ.
    <br>You mentioned that you've actuallly filed for divorced.
    <br>We saw the divorce letter that was being held up on Sunday.
    <br>In the light of what God has done for you here, what is your decision concerning this?
    <br>My decision is that I am definitely going to honour the words of the man of God
    <br>because I believe that through him, God speaks.
    <br>I will definitely call off the divorce as I also want to work things out with my husband.
    <br>Thank God, Madam. We'd like to ask you in the light of what you have received here in The SCOAN,
    <br>and the counsel of Prophet T.B. Joshua that he has given to you,
    <br>what is your word of advice to viewers around the world, especially to married couples?
    <br>I would like to tell them that as Prophet T.B. Joshua always says,
    <br>it's always good to run to God and not to anybody else.
    <br>We all know that the devil does not like places where love exists
    <br>so we need to shame the devil and make sure that whatever situation,
    <br>whatever troubles that you might be going through,
    <br>you need to make sure that you run to God and not to anybody else.
    <br>In life, there are many voices that one can hear.
    <br>T.B. Joshua always says that we must listen to the voice of God,
    <br>not to the voice of your friends or family or the voice of the devil.
    <br>Listen to the voice of God.
    <br>My advice to viewers all around the world, both married and unmarried:
    <br>If you find yourself moving from a hurtful relationship to the next relationship.
    <br>I want you to allow God to release you first before you move into the next relationship
    <br>because if you carry the pain from the past relationship into your new relationship, like I did,
    <br>you will likely end up experiencing the same thing as I have experienced in my marriage.
    <br>You mean to say in your own case, you carried pain of a past relationship
    <br>into this marriage and that really affected the marriage.
    <br>Yes, in my own case, I carried the pain of my past relationship into my marriage
    <br>and it truly affected me.
    <br>I want to apologise to my wife who has been suffering from my pain of the past.
    <br>I want to advise every viewer to make God's Word the standard of their life and their marriage.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus. We want to encourage this couple to continue to stay close to Jesus Christ
    <br>and we believe the two of you will come back here with more wonderful testimonies,
    <br>now that God Almighty has come into this matter, and we know the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
