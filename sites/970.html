  <p>    
    <br>There is a brother with a red suit. Come here.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Ok, it's alright.
    <br>Brother, you have an issue with a child. They say the child is not your child.
    <br>I have been doubting.
    <br>They say the pregnancy is not your own.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>A woman introduced you to this man.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>The woman who introduced you is now saying that the child is not for him.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>She told me that someone came to her and told her something like that.
    <br>So, that was why she called me last Sunday.
    <br>Brother, they are playing games with you.
    <br>I lived in Greece for many years.
    <br>Why are you afraid that you are not the one?
    <br>Because the baby doesn't look like me.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Can you see that that question has exposed everything?
    <br>Simple.
    <br>We need God's wisdom.
    <br>Only that question alone - I'm not going to proceed.
    <br>I will see them one-on-one.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is James Chineke.
    <br>The person beside me is my beautiful and lovely wife.
    <br>And this is my son - Emmanuel Chineke.
    <br>On last week Sunday during the mass prayer, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, pointed at my direction.
    <br>He prophesied about a man wearing a red suit that he has a controversy concerning a child.
    <br>I confirm it to be 100% plus true.
    <br>Actually, it was two weeks ago -  I was with my wife when my sister called my wife.
    <br>She asked her to bring the child and come over to her house.
    <br>I asked my wife, "Why is your face like this on the telephone?"
    <br>She told me that my sister said that the child is not our child.
    <br>I said, "What?" - It was like I was dreaming. I couldn't believe it.
    <br>I said, "Can I hear it again?"
    <br>"She said it is not our child."
    <br>I said, "What?"
    <br>At the time, I started asking my wife, "Do you understand what my sister is talking about?"
    <br>She said, "No". She was laughing as if we were joking.
    <br>I couldn't stand it.
    <br>I continued asking her. She still said the same thing.
    <br>The next day, I went to see my sister.
    <br>I told my sister, "My wife told me about what is happening".
    <br>My sister did not even want to talk to me.
    <br>She told me, "There are people rumouring around and all this et cetera".
    <br>I asked, "About what?"
    <br>She said, "They think that the child is not ours. It is someone else's".
    <br>My wife started telling my sister that she didn't know what she was talking about.
    <br>I also said, "My sister, what do you want us to do about this?"
    <br>She told me that the ball was in my court.
    <br>That she was waiting for me to do something about that.
    <br>When I came here, I was praying (for the man of God to locate me)
    <br>because I didn't want to go anywhere else.
    <br>I believe so much in The SCOAN.
    <br>That God should use Prophet T.B. Joshua to reveal any secret thing.
    <br>That God can see me through here.
    <br>When I came here, I was praying, "God, I don't want to go anywhere else.
    <br>I just want You to see me through Prophet T.B. Joshua. I want him to locate me".
    <br>To God be the glory, it was on last week Sunday that the man of God pointed at my direction,
    <br>that there was such a thing about a child.
    <br>I said to myself, "Ok, it means that what anybody is rumouring about,
    <br>now God will show me that He is really God in my family".
    <br>The man of God promised us that we will see him one-on-one.
    <br>When we went there, he told us that the child is my own child.
    <br>Children of God, 'Emmanuel' once more!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>That is my testimony.
    <br>Concerning about...
    <br>Sorry - I want to apologise to my wife before going on.
    <br>She is my beautiful wife and to tell you the truth:
    <br>She doesn't know anything about men. I'm even the first man in her life.
    <br>I'm telling you the truth.
    <br>I'm the first man in her life. She doesn't know any other man. It's true.
    <br>So to the glory of God, we want the viewers to understand what you are saying.
    <br>You came here last week.
    <br>As you were praying, the man of God prophesied about your case
    <br>and you came out to confirm the prophecy of the man of God.
    <br>- Is that so?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>And the man of God said that he will see you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, after the prophecy, tell us what happened.
    <br>When I went home, I told my sister and my family about it. Everybody was happy.
    <br>I'm really happy for this day. Today is one of my happiest days on earth, to tell you the truth.
    <br>Everyone was happy.
    <br>Even the testimony I'm giving now, I know that they are watching me right now.
    <br>Concerning my family: My sister is completely convinced now because of what she heard
    <br>from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, about the confirmation of this child.
    <br>When I told her about it and also my younger siblings, everybody was very happy.
    <br>After the prophecy of the man of God, because of the issue on the ground, that this baby is not yours...
    <br>After they had listened to the prophecy of the man of God, they are now convinced and happy.
    <br>Yes, they are very happy now.
    <br>And what are they saying?
    <br>They said, "Ok". Everyone was playing with my son.
    <br>They were now happy with my wife and were apologising that what they had said was wrong.
    <br>That it was not true and that they were very sorry.
    <br>That she should forgive them for everything.
    <br>So you are confirming the word of prophecy given by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>concerning the baby - that they said that the baby is not yours.
    <br>This is just a frame-up, and your family, everybody believes now, apologising to you and your wife,
    <br>"Oh, hearing from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, we believe that this baby is yours".
    <br>Yes, they believe now that the baby is mine.
    <br>Everybody is very happy.
    <br>Going by the question the man of God asked you last Sunday,
    <br>"What can you say about this issue?",
    <br>you said that the baby does not look like you.
    <br>What do you have to say now?
    <br>I have apologised to my wife. That it was pressure.
    <br>I was under pressure and stress.
    <br>I'm very sorry for that.
    <br>Even though...
    <br>Mr & Mrs Chineke
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Put your hands together!
    <br>Mr & Mrs Chineke
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So, my wife understands me very well that it was pressure and stress behind all this.
    <br>I'm very sorry - once more again.
    <br>So everything is settled now. To God be the glory.
    <br>Everything is settled.
    <br>People of God, let's put our hands together for Christ Jesus!
    <br>Mr & Mrs Chineke
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>On last week Sunday, the man of God gave my husband a prophecy concerning our child
    <br>which I confirm to be true because two weeks ago, I received a call, as he said,
    <br>from his sister concerning the child that the child that they thought was theirs was not.
    <br>I was like, "What are you saying? I don't understand". I was just laughing.
    <br>I didn't feel that they were accusing me of something like that.
    <br>My husband questioned me.
    <br>I told him, "Daddy, do you need to ask me this question? Why are you still asking me that one?
    <br>I was even angry because of the question he was asking me, "Is it true or not?"
    <br>They were supposed to know that it was not true.
    <br>Later on, the man of God prophesied about it.
    <br>I was so happy because that was one of my prayer points
    <br>that God should vindicate me through the man of God.
    <br>As he had seen other peoples' problems, he should also see mine because it was an embarrassment to me.
    <br>I would never think of doing something like this.
    <br>I thank God for last Sunday, that everything was out and open.
    <br>I thank God for vindicating me.
    <br>Even the comment that he made that the child did not look like him,
    <br>I didn't take it as anything because I knew that he was not that kind of man.
    <br>I knew it was out of pressure that he made that comment.
    <br>At home, he was pleading, begging for forgiveness.
    <br>I said, "No problem. I know that it was the devil's handwork.
    <br>He wanted to bring sadness into our marriage".
    <br>Because all this while - we have been married for two years - we have been so happy.
    <br>We have been living like best friends, like brother and sister, and also like husband and wife.
    <br>I thank God for everything. I give God all the glory.
    <br>Let's put our hands together!
    <br>Yes, prophecy with instant solution, and we thank God for your life.
    <br>The advice I have for people listening to me:
    <br>When you are in fear, doubt or anxiety, or in this kind of situation,
    <br>you should not run away from God.
    <br>Run to God because He is the one that gives peace of heart, freedom from fear
    <br>and liberty from anxiety. Thank you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Chineke
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My advice goes to the viewers all over the world:
    <br>First of all, I thank God for this testimony, for opening doors, breakthrough and blessings.
    <br>More especially my friends watching me right now all over the world,
    <br>more especially in Greece:
    <br>I want to tell you that these are rumours. They are fake and not real.
    <br>When you are experiencing this type of mess - rumours or accusations - please handle it with care.
    <br>Don't run from God; run to God. God has the final say.
    <br>In my own case, I didn't go anywhere.
    <br>Despite the stress and pressure I was experiencing, I didn't think of going outside God.
    <br>I came here because I knew that God has the final solution.
    <br>Once more, I want to thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We Nigerians really don't know what we have.
    <br>It's a pity. I'm sorry to use that word.
    <br>It's a pity. We don't know what we have.
    <br>That is my advice.
    <br>Let me ask you, sir. If this prophecy had not come, what do you think might have happened to this marriage?
    <br>Actually, this question is very important.
    <br>It's almost... because I'm a kind of person that does not try such kind of thing.
    <br>It would have really been divorce.
    <br>100 percent plus divorce.
    <br>And once again, people want to hear from you.
    <br>What can you say about this baby? Who is this baby?
    <br>The baby is mine.
    <br>Hallelujah! People of God, put your hands together!
    <br>Mr & Mrs Chineke
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Yes, God Almight is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has done in this family,
    <br>and we believe the best is yet to come.
    <br>Very soon, we are expecting more of your testimonies. Amen!
    <br>Mr & Mrs Chineke
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
