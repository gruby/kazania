  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>that is the language everywhere - Happy Easter!
    <br>I need to use a language you understand. But today, we are going to talk about that revelation.
    <br>For the name Jesus is revelation and the message too is revelation.
    <br>Even faith is made known by divine revelation.
    <br>And even I'm here today - if you are not looking at me through revelation,
    <br>you continue to see T.B. Joshua, that your brother that has white hair here.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes
    <br>You are not here to see the man.
    <br>You are here by revelation to see a man called Prophet,
    <br>not a man called T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>T.B. Joshua is your brother. There is a man you need to know by revelation.
    <br>That is divine nature.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Ok, let's quickly look at the book of 1 Corinthians 12, the name Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>1 Corinthians 12:3:
    <br>"Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says,
    <br>'Jesus be cursed', and no one can say 'Jesus is Lord', except by the help of the Holy Ghost."
    <br>You can say "Jesus." It means you cannot just wake up and say "Jesus" without being led.
    <br>Because you hear people say "Jesus" and you say "Jesus" - you are calling your brother at home.
    <br>I was watching a game yesterday; I saw a guy named Jesus.
    <br>And the referee would say "Jesus, Jesus!" and I would say, "What Jesus?"
    <br>On the field. That was yesterday, I saw a guy who was playing football - number 7.
    <br>His name is Jesus. I said, "Aha! So this is the name some of our people used to call".
    <br>And the man cannot help them.
    <br>But the Jesus of Nazareth can be revealed to you by revelation.
    <br>You must be led by the Spirit to that Jesus -
    <br>not to the name of your brother, but to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's read together again. 1 Corinthians 12:3:
    <br>"Therefore I want you to know that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says..."
    <br>But if you call the name Jesus by the help of the Spirit, you will not call your brother at home.
    <br>...no one can say 'Jesus is Lord', except by the Holy Ghost."
    <br>That is, Holy Spirit. The name Jesus must be revealed to you.
    <br>No one can say "Jesus is Lord" except by the Holy Spirit, by the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>What does that mean? Your God is not a human being.
    <br>Because He came from where? To do what?
    <br>Because we say "Happy Easter", what is the meaning of Easter?
    <br>What do mean? Whom are we celebrating? Is it your brother or someone you know somewhere?
    <br>You know revelation brings conviction. And conviction brings real movement.
    <br>When we say real movement, we mean, power steps.
    <br>The moment you say, "I am a Christian", you talk of power. You can't separate Christianity from power.
    <br>Christianity lies in the heart.
    <br>Real movement means power steps - steps with intent, purpose.
    <br>Revelation is the realisation of something previously not known.
    <br>"Hey, Jesus Christ!" - in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Like we are going to see today. We are going to see Jesus in the power of the Holy Ghost
    <br>and it will be revealed to you in the Spirit.
    <br>Healing is a relation.
    <br>Deliverance is a revelation.
    <br>Salvation is a revelation.
    <br>He said: "Be healed!" You just see people begin to, "What is happening here?"
    <br>Just because I said to you that studying the Bible is good for you,
    <br>that does not mean that I can get you to believe that studying the Bible is good for you.
    <br>You must get that revelation in order to believe.
    <br>That is, I had the revelation that studying the Bible is good for you.
    <br>That does not mean that I can get you to believe that studying the Bible is good for you.
    <br>You must get that revelation in order to believe.
    <br>The challenges we have now is that we are too conditioned into believing
    <br>that what we are reading in the Bible is for people in the Bible.
    <br>When you remember your weakness, your fault, your pitfall,
    <br>you say,  "'Son of David, have mercy on me', that is for the blind Bartholomew".
    <br>You blind today, when you remember your weakness, pitfall, sin,
    <br>you say,  "No, that cannot work for me. That is for the man".
    <br>We are too conditioned into believing that what God said can happen to others
    <br>will not happen to you.
    <br>That is just the sense.
    <br>What God says can happen to others will not happen to you - that is the condition.
    <br>We look at all of our weaknesses, sins, pitfalls, faults and say,
    <br>"It is not going to happen to me because of my sin".
    <br>Remember the message I gave last Sunday.
    <br>Success, greatness is not about your weakness, fault, pitfall.
    <br>It is about what Jesus did for us at the cross.
    <br>He made us fit for God.
    <br>He made us what?
    <br>Fit! This is what we are talking about today.
    <br>Fitness means, your past is over;
    <br>your sin has been forgiven.
    <br>If your sin has been forgiven, what follows?
    <br>He made you fit for God.
    <br>Tell your neighbor, "Happy Easter! Jesus made you fit for God!"
    <br>I can´t hear you.
    <br>Happy Easter! Jesus made you fit for God!
    <br>You are a work of art.
    <br>If you want to become God's person, follow His process.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,  "If you want to become God's person, follow His process".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>"If you want to become God's person, follow His process."
    <br>Again.
    <br>"If you want to become God's person, follow His process."
    <br>That is that. That's like you take a pen.
    <br>You just begin to draw.
    <br>You put hair, you put hand, you put that - you want to put on the picture of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You know where you have to start from.
    <br>You say, This is leg, this is hand.
    <br>You are a work of art.
    <br>If you want to become God's person, follow His process.
    <br>All the way to Calvary He went for me
    <br>He went to set me free
    <br>For you to be here today and join us to celebrate Easter, God prepared you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neightbour, "God prepared me in advance".
    <br>Tell your neighbour again, "For me to be here today, God prepared me in advance
    <br>before putting me in the fire of life".
    <br>He was there before Daniel in the lion's den. That is why the lions turned to friends.
    <br>That is why the fire turned to ice because He was there.
    <br>God is trying to build character now so that when you get to the place of destiny,
    <br>you will not crash, explode and lose it all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Nothing good happens without discipline.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>"Nothing good happens without discipline."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>"Nothing good happens without discipline."
    <br>Again
    <br>"Nothing good happens without discipline."
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>"Nothing good happens without discipline."
    <br>If you count many things that happened to you, that you are not satisfied,
    <br>that you are not happy with, you will know you were not disciplined when all this happened.
    <br>They came when you were out of discipline.
    <br>Nothing good happens without discipline.
    <br>You talk of sickness, you talk of this, you talk of that.
    <br>Any time you are disciplined, what follows? Good.
    <br>Any time you are not disciplined, what follows? Bad.
    <br>Nothing good happens without discipline.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Nothing good happens without discipline".
    <br>Becoming rich and influential without the right character is all type.
    <br>It is out of balance.
    <br>Jesus does not want us to succeed financially and lose our kids, children to drugs
    <br>and lose our children to militants and lose our children to the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Pick that word and take it home before you begin to celebrate. Go and put your home in order.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sometimes you say, "I run after business... Look at my friend".
    <br>You want to be a Christian? Look at your children. What are you doing with them?
    <br>You want to be great and abandon them to drugs. You want to be great and allow them to be in the world.
    <br>You can never be great in the Lord.
    <br>All the way to Calvary He went for me
    <br>He went to set me free
    <br>Becoming rich and influential without the right character is all type.
    <br>It is out of balance.
    <br>The children, they are part of your blessing.
    <br>If one is faulty, all are faulty. If one is bad, all are bad.
    <br>There is no shortcut.
    <br>Life is a marathon, not a sprint - no shortcuts.
    <br>We want to use a shortcut.
    <br>You see the world today.
    <br>When you see many general managers, these are the people who cannot manage their homes.
    <br>Many heads of parastatals cannot manage their homes.
    <br>Many want to own their own company, and they cannot keep their own car clean.
    <br>What kind of company do you expect from people like that?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many want to get married because of their age but they cannot keep their pet at home.
    <br>They cannot manage their pet at home but they want to get married because of their age.
    <br>This is what turns the whole world upside down today.
    <br>You that cannot keep your car clean, you want to own your own company.
    <br>You cannot manage your home but you are the head of big, different companies.
    <br>MD of the companies.
    <br>What can you expect from such a company?
    <br>Charity begins at home.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>Jesus was able to manage His team.
    <br>That is why He paid the supreme price wee are here today to celebrate.
    <br>Jesus does not want any one of us to end our days saying,
    <br>"I should have been, I would have been, I could have been".
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Jesús does not want us to end our days saying,
    <br>'I could have been, I should have been, I would have been'".
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service.
    <br>We are here today.
    <br>Your kid is at home; your children are at home.
    <br>You can't say, "Let us go!" They will tell you, "What are you celebrating?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But you are the leader, controller, instructor, commander of other children.
    <br>We want to use shortcuts.
    <br>Life is a marathon.
    <br>You want to be God's person - follow His process.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Nothing good happens without discipline.
    <br>Nothing good happens without what?
    <br>Discipline!
    <br>This is whyJesus is trying to build character now so that when you get to the place of your destiny,
    <br>you will not crash, explode and lose it all.
    <br>Many lose it all today. You see the world - going up and losing it all.
    <br>Greatness - lose it all. Popularity, fame - lose it all because we are not following the process.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I know why I'm going through what I'm going through.
    <br>God is busy building character".
    <br>Yes, that character will help you.
    <br>When you are at the place of your destiny, it will help you to sustain, to stand the challenges of time.
    <br>You say, "Ah! My business is not going well! Why is my business like this?
    <br>Why do I not have a job? What's wrong?
    <br>I'm sick. I am a Christian".
    <br>Ask God for the reason.
    <br>It may be that God is busy building character.
    <br>Say after me, "God is trying to build character NOW!".
    <br>I can´t hear you.
    <br>God is trying to build character NOW!
    <br>That NOW should be in a capital form - Capital N, Capital O, Capital W.
    <br>God is trying to build character NOW!
    <br>If you don't get that character NOW, whatever you achieve, you will likely lose it!
    <br>Character is a tonic.
    <br>There's nothing you can keep for a while, for long, without character.
    <br>Character is the oil in the lamp.
    <br>Whatever you achieve is that flame. The light that is burning; but the oil in the lamp is character.
    <br>And if there is no oil in the lamp, what will happen to the lamp?
    <br>It will be off!
    <br>One thing off!
    <br>One, one, one, one!
    <br>Influence will be off!
    <br>The glory will be off!
    <br>Popularity will be off! They say, "Where is this man? They can't hear of him again!"
    <br>The oil is dry - that is character.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The oil in the lamp is character.
    <br>The lamp light is what?
    <br>Proceeds.
    <br>Proceeds could be money, fame, popularity, this, that, president, minister, senate.
    <br>These are proceeds, but the oil inside the lamp is character.
    <br>And when the oil dries, all the proceeds will soon...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I were you, just put a lamp on your altar.
    <br>I know you have everything you need.
    <br>Electricity is there but electricity apart, put a lamp on your table.
    <br>It is a symbol that the light there is proceeds.
    <br>The oil inside the lamp is character.
    <br>Any time you fail to put oil and you try, you see the light off.
    <br>That is your life. When you put a lamp on your altar, it's a symbol of you. You are that lamp.
    <br>If you look at my altar, you see a lamp there. There is electricity. People say,  "Why that lamp?"
    <br>Yes, it is a symbol.
    <br>When the oil is gradually drying, you see a kind of dim light.
    <br>That is, you are not able to identify anything with that dim light.
    <br>This is the life of many of us today.
    <br>Your proceeds are not enough. It's causing you trouble.
    <br>Where you are supposed to give 1 million naira, 1 million dollar, you are given 5000 naira.
    <br>What is not done well, is not done at all.
    <br>They have given you a name.
    <br>You don't know what to do again because what you have is no longer enough because the oil is drying.
    <br>We are talking of dividends of Easter
    <br>What is Easter?
    <br>He went for you to make you fit, to make you qualified,
    <br>to make you a friend of God, to make you dine and wine with God.
    <br>You can still reinstate your way and put things right.
    <br>Those of you that know that you cannot even manage the little home you have
    <br>but you are the head of companies,
    <br>you can still look back because you'll soon lose it all.
    <br>You have money, influence and you have lost your kid, your children to drugs,
    <br>militants, the world - you can still look back.
    <br>It is not too late to carry them along.
    <br>What is right is right;  what is not right is not right.
    <br>Nothing good happens without discipline.
    <br>We look at all our weaknesses, faults and say,
    <br>"It is not going to happen to me - what happened to others".
    <br>What happens in the name of God is not about your weakness, pitfalls, faults;
    <br>It is about what Jesus achieved, did for us.
    <br>He made you qualified.
    <br>I say, it can happen to you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>If satan wants to rob you of your blessings, he will say to you,
    <br>"Because of your weakness!"
    <br>He will immediately remind you of your weakness, your faults.
    <br>And when that begins to come into your heart, you know it is the work of satan.
    <br>You know you came from home.
    <br>Many of you through flight - you know it's fire of life to fly on the air.
    <br>Human being pilots - he may be a drunkard, smoker.
    <br>But that is fire of life.
    <br>If God has not prepared you in advance, you will not be able to skip through.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday service
    <br>Say, "He prepared me in advance before putting me inside the aircraft, train, vehicle to here".
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>If God had not prepared you, it would have been very easy for your enemy to get you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday service
    <br>From one flight to stopover, sleeping, joining another flight,
    <br>back, entering a car - oh my God!
    <br>He had prepared you in advance before putting you...
    <br>Say, "He had prepared me in advance before putting me in the fire of life".
    <br>You can say to your neighbour,  "Happy Easter!"
    <br>Jesus of Nazareth must built character
    <br>so that when you get to the place of your destiny, you will not crash.
    <br>Now, here is character.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>Answer me.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>You know I told you that the Word becomes part of us by meditation.
    <br>The Word of God becomes part of you by what? - Meditation.
    <br>See.
    <br>Sometimes when I'm alone, I continue to fire on.
    <br>I told you I watched a game yesterday - football.
    <br>I have time; it´s not a sin. I was just sitting there and watching while this one was in my hand.
    <br>I saw that number 7.
    <br>"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!" - I said, "Which Jesus are they calling?"
    <br>He was about to score. They said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, go, go!"
    <br>I said, "Ah! This one is not Jesus; he cannot score".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Can I hear your lesson and the message you are taking home this Easter?
    <br>Come on. Someone there.
    <br>Tell me about your children now.
    <br>Jesus does not want you to succeed and lose your kid to drugs.
    <br>Jesus does not want me to succeed and lose my kids, so thereby I must work on my character
    <br>and my children - I must work on their spiritual life.
    <br>You can see that I´m drawing very close to you because I like what you are saying.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>Jesus does not want you to succeed and lose your kid to drugs.
    <br>He does not want you to succeed financially and lose your kid to militants.
    <br>He does not want you to succeed and lose your kid to the world.
    <br>What do you want to say about that?
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>The one at home.
    <br>By the grace of God, I'm teaching them the way of God because I want them to grow in the fear...
    <br>And they listen to you?
    <br>Yes, daddy. By the grace of God, they listen to me.
    <br>Your daughter listens to you?
    <br>Yes, daddy, by the grace of God.
    <br>Don´t - why the grace of God? It is the grace of God.
    <br>Nowadays when you hear a Christian saying, "By the grace of God, I will get there", it is a lie.
    <br>He is saying, expressing a doubt.
    <br>When a man says, "By the grace of God, I will get there", he is expressing doubt.
    <br>What kind of grace?
    <br>Grace is not a mango.
    <br>Okay, we are helping you. Now you know the message, you are to go back.
    <br>You have a job to do.
    <br>Most especially that daughter. You have to go back and work on her.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>Okay?
    <br>If not, you may likely lose it all.
    <br>That is, the blessing you have.
    <br>Yes, daddy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>When I heard the message, "Jesus does not want me to succeed because He wants to prepare me
    <br>or prepare my children for my future",
    <br>this made me to remember a dream I had some time ago.
    <br>Before you go further - did you listen to  the way she turned it now?
    <br>She said it is like God is building character, that is why her success is delayed.
    <br>If you don't have character and you succeed, you may likely lose it all.
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>So, for you now to be thinking that "God does not answer my prayer"...
    <br>No, who told you that God does not answer your prayer. He loves you; He´s busy building character.
    <br>Nothing good happens without discipline.
    <br>I think the message I will take home is that
    <br>nothing good happens without discipline.
    <br>All challenges a human being has is a part of discipline.
    <br>You cannot have salvation without discipline.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>It's not possible to have salvation without discipline.
    <br>If you have that salvation, you will lose it all.
    <br>No salvation without discipline. Nothing good happens without discipline.
    <br>Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.
    <br>Without salvation - you're looking for salvation, trying to earn it.
    <br>Because everything you earn,
    <br>it's only by the time you agree with yourself that "This is what I can do,
    <br>that money is good" - but not just getting money from all angles,
    <br>there is money that is without process
    <br>and when it comes to you, it's actually not going to help you.
    <br>That money is good but with process.
    <br>Thank you. Clap for him.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>So it is time now to begin to think inwardly.
    <br>Many of us here are heading a company.
    <br>Many of us here own their own company.
    <br>There are many MDs, general managers here.
    <br>You can still look back. Even your little house, you cannot manage them.
    <br>Are you talking of those of us that have a company -
    <br>your car, house - one can see that this is a general manager.
    <br>There are many marriages today - tension, so much tension
    <br>because God's time is the best.
    <br>Take a lesson.
    <br>We also have many here that are blessed - you have money, you have enough.
    <br>Where are your children?
    <br>Many of our children - we have lost them to the world.
    <br>If you don't quickly run to God and look back,
    <br>seek for solution for these children, you may likely lose it all.
    <br>Like I have said, Jesus does not want us to end our days saying,
    <br>"I could have been, I should have been, I would have been".
    <br>Let´s hear from you.
    <br>I have learnt that before you believe, you must get your own revelation.
    <br>You must believe in God through the Holy Spirit to get a revelation.
    <br>There's nothing that you can become - an MD - without carrying your children along.
    <br>You must always carry your children along.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>They are an integral part of you.
    <br>On the last day, our Lord Jesus will ask you, "Where are they?"
    <br>Will you tell Jesus, "I have lost them to drugs"?
    <br>Will you tell Jesús, "I have lost them to militants"?
    <br>Will you tell Jesus, "I have lost them to the world"?
    <br>Question mark.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Anyone?
    <br>Okay, my brother here.
    <br>I've learned that life is a marathon, not a sprint
    <br>and God can use any situation to discipline us.
    <br>So we must value the process.
    <br>Thank you. Clap for him.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Our brother is taking us through to process.
    <br>That if you want to become God's person, you must follow His process.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Let's hear from our sister.
    <br>Good morning, Church.
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>What I learnt today is that there is no shortcut in life.
    <br>That as we are a work of art in God's hand, we must wait patiently
    <br>and follow His process so that whatsoever we will receive in life,
    <br>will stand a test of time. Emmanuel!
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>She said, you are a work of art.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You know you take a pen, you are taking a picture, trying to draw some objects.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I'm a work of art".
    <br>Again and again.
    <br>If you want to be a person of God, you must follow His process.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>What I'm taking back home with me - I have learnt here that
    <br>we cannot separate Christianity from power.
    <br>The revelation I got here for myself is that
    <br>the wisdom is to see but seeing is also power from God and responsibility
    <br>which means, through the power of God, we can change the situation.
    <br>My brother must like power.
    <br>Power - my brother likes power. Clap for my brother.
    <br>You can see in the statement that he mentioned power up to four times.
    <br>That is, revelation brings conviction and conviction brings real movement.
    <br>Real movement - power steps.
    <br>Can you understand that?
    <br>Power steps - steps with intent and purpose.
    <br>Clap for my brother. Thank you very much.
    <br>With this, you can know if you are born again.
    <br>You can know.
    <br>The question - what kind of Christian do you want to be?
    <br>Ask you neighbour.
    <br>What kind of Christian do you want to be?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>What kind of Christian do you want to be?
    <br>Because there are many Christians - Christians without the power of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>Christians with the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Because to be a Christian, you must be led by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>And many Christians today are not led by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>That's why I'm asking you what kind of Christian you want to be.
    <br>What kind of leader do you want to be? -  A leader with purpose.
    <br>A leader with difference
    <br>So when we talk of power, as a Christian, you need to ask what kind of Christian you want to be.
    <br>When the Bible says in 1 Corinthians verses 12-30,
    <br>"No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' without the help of the Holy Ghost",
    <br>no one can be a Christian without the help of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Thank you. Our brother.
    <br>Good morning, Church.
    <br>The lesson I learnt today, that I will take home is about character and self-discipline.
    <br>We are not to rush to have big things while we cannot manage small things.
    <br>The man of God talked about not being able to clean a small car,
    <br>but you want to run a fleet of Benz.
    <br>Clap for my brother.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Yes! You want to have your own company,
    <br>fleet of companies and you cannot keep your car clean.
    <br>You'll be very surprised to see many owners of companies if you open their garage.
    <br>They cannot do anything. They have housemaid, houseboy - money cannot do anything.
    <br>What are you talking about?
    <br>You have to lead by example; if not, you will lose it all.
    <br>Like that.
    <br>We have many of us here that this message is talking to.
    <br>You own companies.
    <br>Not one, not two, not three companies.
    <br>In a week, you may not even go to any of these companies
    <br>because you have money to employ people to do the job for you.
    <br>For how long will you continue this?
    <br>Can money run a company?
    <br>Your presence is a good thing to your worker and to your follower.
    <br>They want to know how you became what you are.
    <br>They want to know how you talk.
    <br>They want to know how you move. They want to know how you relate with people.
    <br>That will give them hope for the future.
    <br>But hardly - your staff, workers hardly see you one day.
    <br>They don't know their boss.
    <br>You live in Heaven.
    <br>Let's hear from our brother.
    <br>The word that I'm carrying with me home
    <br>is that the Word of God becomes part of us through meditation.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The more you meditate, the more you hear the voice of the Lord
    <br>and the more you become the person of the Lord and will follow His processes.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Meditation brings revelation; revelation brings conviction
    <br>and conviction brings real movement.
    <br>Can you see? - Process.
    <br>If you want to be God's person, you must follow His process.
    <br>Meditation. What am I talking about now? Begin to meditate.
    <br>Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate.
    <br>And turn it over and over in your heart.
    <br>Revelation comes and that revelation will become conviction and lead you to real movement.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday service
    <br>Yes, the message I'm taking home is that life is a marathon and not a sprint.
    <br>and that discipline plays an important role in our lives.
    <br>Can you tell me how this affects you?
    <br>Me..?
    <br>Because you are a young man..
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I know you are talking by your experience.
    <br>He's laughing.
    <br>People want to learn..
    <br>We are hungering for the knowledge, this Easter.
    <br>Hungry for the knowledge.
    <br>Most of us want to be successful so fast by using the shortcut.
    <br>Thank you. Clap for him.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>He's a young one so I know. He said, we want to make a shortcut,
    <br>forgetting that life is a marathon, not just a sprint.
    <br>Shortcut means, we are not waiting for God to build character.
    <br>If you don't wait for God to build this character in you,
    <br>by the time you get to your place of destiny, what happens?
    <br>Something will crash, explode and you will likely lose all.
    <br>This is what is happening today.
    <br>This is what is happening all over the world.
    <br>Character - like I have said - is oil in the lamp.
    <br>When there's no oil in the lamp, what happens to the light?
    <br>That's just it!  That's just you!
    <br>Now with this message, now you know why you are going through what you are going through.
    <br>It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer".
    <br>Again..
    <br>"It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer."
    <br>"God, I need, I need, I need a car. I need a car. I need to pay my debt."
    <br>But after the prayer, nothing. The prayer seems not to answer.
    <br>I now say I have no faith. - No!
    <br>God is busy building character.
    <br>God knows, "If I give you what you want immediately - Ha!
    <br>Something will crash and you will likely lose it all".
    <br>So you say,"I have no faith". That is why you have stopped going to church.
    <br>"I have no faith." That is why you refuse to pray.
    <br>You pray, "Lord, I want to pass my examination".
    <br>But when the result come out, you find that there's some setback or failure.
    <br>You now say, "I fast. I pray. Even my friend that was not fasting, that was not praying,
    <br>has first class. But I fast, I pray but see me. I have third class".
    <br>No, the reason why you will not have your result is: God is holding you a little back;
    <br>He wants to build your character.
    <br>When the character comes, you can stand for the greatness that is coming.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday service
    <br>The result of your prayer now is not all that important now but more important tomorrow.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>The result of my prayer now is not all that important now but more important tomorrow.
    <br>That is, what you are going to receive today after prayer from God
    <br>is important but more important tomorrow.
    <br>You need it in a difficult time; in the trial time, you need those results.
    <br>So please, God is trying to build character.
    <br>Listen to that. God is trying to do what? - To build character.
    <br>So that when you get to the place of your destiny,
    <br>you will not crash, explode and lose it all.
    <br>Okay, next.
    <br>I just want to thank God for revealing this revelation to me.
    <br>Because what I was going through, I didn't know that God was disciplining me.
    <br>My life was in a mess and I just thought, "What is going on in my life?"
    <br>Because my first time of coming here to this church, it was not for the salvation of my soul.
    <br>It was all about - I wanted business, making money.
    <br>But myself, I didn't have the character. Even the way I used to talk to people,
    <br>it was not representing that I am a Christian.
    <br>So I just want to thank God for this revelation
    <br>that God is building my character and it is God's processing.
    <br>Clap for my mum.
    <br>Good!
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>My mum now realised that nothing good happens without discipline.
    <br>And what gives us discipline?  - God's character.
    <br>It is God's character that brings discipline; the proceeds of God's character is discipline.
    <br>Nothing good happens without what?
    <br>Without discipline.
    <br>Salvation cannot come without discipline.
    <br>Even the blessings we are waiting for or the healing we are waiting for now -
    <br>if you are healed without discipline, you will likely lose it.
    <br>If you are blessed without discipline, you will likely lose it.
    <br>If you are blessed without discipline, it will crash. And it will crash at a time you will need it most.
    <br>Emmanuel! What I've learnt today is that yes, God has provided for all our needs
    <br>but we are the cause of the delay
    <br>because we don't want to submit to God's discipline process.
    <br>Clap for my brother.
    <br>That is, we are the cause of delay because we don't want to submit.
    <br>We just want something from God but we are not ready to submit.
    <br>We are not ready for salvation; salvation is salvation.
    <br>We are not ready for salvation so we are the cause of delay.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>So listen to my brother. He said, "We are the cause of delay".
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>- Yes!
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank you.
