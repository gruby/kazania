    <br>Warning! The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>Jesus said in the Book of Matthew 11:28, "Come to me all of you who are weary
    <br>and carry heavy burdens and I will give you rest".
    <br>At the Synagogue Church Of All Nations, this gentleman carries a small boy in his arms.
    <br>Due to the severity of his problem, he cannot walk or even stand on his own
    <br>because of the excruciating pain of the hot water burns he sustained in a terrible accident.
    <br>The hot water burns scorched from the top of his thigh all the way down  his leg.
    <br>He is not able to wear his trousers
    <br>as any contact with the burns will cause extreme pain and discomfort for this young boy.
    <br>The boy's skin glistens with puss and blood, and it's raw and incredibly painful.
    <br>A burn of this degree would defy any medical solution.
    <br>They have come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations believing
    <br>that Jesus Christ can put an end to this young boy's suffering.
    <br>Please tell us your name, your age and your address.
    <br>My name is Mr Tairu. The boy sitting on my lap is the son of my brother.
    <br>What's his name and age?
    <br>His name is Master Jelili Tairu and he is twelve years old.
    <br>Can you tell us the problem that brought this little boy to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations today?
    <br>The problem that brought us here is hot water burns.
    <br>You mean he has hot water burns?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Since this problem started, he cannot walk or eat. He is in pain and agony.
    <br>That is what we have been facing from when it started until this time.
    <br>Can you tell us who has been assisting him to go about doing all these things?
    <br>His mother and I.
    <br>His mother and you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you tell us when and where you have taken him to for solution before coming to The SCOAN?
    <br>We took him to the hospital.
    <br>The doctor tried all efforts but there was no improvement.
    <br>The doctor himself told me about The SCOAN.
    <br>After he made all efforts, he told me to bring the boy to The SCOAN,
    <br>so that he would come and receive his healing.
    <br>You mean the doctor who had been treating this boy directed you to The SCOAN
    <br>so that this boy could be set free through God's intervention?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Ok. What is your belief in God today?
    <br>I believe in God that Jesus Christ will set us free today.
    <br>I pray with you that God Almighty will set this brother free
    <br>from this problem of hot water burns today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>This traumatising experience is too much for twelve-year-old Master Jelili Taitu.
    <br>A young boy should not have to suffer this kind of torment and affliction.
    <br>But despite the unbearable pain, he waits in faith believing that by Jesus' stripes,
    <br>his healing has been paid for and provided freely.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>This is Master Jelili Tairu, harldy able to sit on his uncle's lap at The SCOAN prayer line
    <br>because of the sensitivity of the terrible wound caused by the hot water burns.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua stretches forth his hand in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>to declare peace, comfort and freedom to this young boy's body, soul and spirit.
    <br>As visitors from all over the world watch and are amazed at the horrendous suffering
    <br>that this boy has gone through,
    <br>the man of God continues to be used as a channel of healing in the young boy's life.
    <br>Declared free, the young boy is able to rise to his feet and walk all by himself.
    <br>Thirteen years later, Mr Jelili Tairu came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to testify to the healing power in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>On the right hand side of the screen, you can see Jelili Tairu's leg
    <br>has been miraculously healed from the hot water burns he had suffered from when he was a small boy.
    <br>On the left is a reminder of the terrible wound that once covered this young man's leg.
    <br>A wound of this severity goes beyond medical science and doctors.
    <br>What wasn't possible for men was possible for God.
    <br>Indeed, Jesus Christ is the Master Healer.
    <br>When Jesus Christ heals, he heals completely; he heals effectually.
    <br>The skin on Mr Jelili Tairu's leg has been completely restored back to the original position
    <br>in which God had created it.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Please tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>My name is Jelili Tairu.
    <br>Since the prayer of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, I have been healed.
    <br>I have no more pain on my legs. Everything is gone.
    <br>I really thank and appreciate God.
    <br>Hallelujah. So can we see you tap the area?
    <br>DOMESTIC ACCIDENT TURNED BAD | Proof that Faith Healing is REAL
    <br>As you are tapping and rubbing it now, are you feeling any pain?
    <br>No, I'm not feeling any pain.
    <br>Can you wear trousers and do all the things you normally did before now?
    <br>Before, when I had the burns on my legs, I could not wear jeans, trousers or even short knickers.
    <br>I hardly wore trousers; I only wore pants and boxers.
    <br>But now after the prayer of the man of God, what can you do?
    <br>After the prayer of the man of God, I felt very strong.
    <br>I am able to wear trousers.
    <br>I feel okay; I no longer have pain on my legs.
    <br>I am feeling well.
    <br>Can you wear your trousers now? Let's see it.
    <br>DOMESTIC ACCIDENT TURNED BAD | Proof that Faith Healing is REAL
    <br>So tell us - are you feeling any pain and discomfort as your are dressing up now?
    <br>No, I don't feel pain; I feel fine now.
    <br>Glory be to God. Once again, can you tap that area and show us that you're not feeling any pain there?
    <br>Mr Jelili Tairu's leg has been completely restored and is completely free from the hot water burns.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me and saving my life!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>So right now, brother, can you tell us your name and your testimony.
    <br>My name is Tairu Jelili.
    <br>I am here to share the goodness of God in my life.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was hot water burns.
    <br>It happened one day when my mother was boiling water in the kitchen.
    <br>She sent me to the kitchen to check if the water was boiling.
    <br>After getting to the kitchen, I checked the water
    <br>and the pot of water fell and poured on my thigh down to my foot.
    <br>So I screamed .
    <br>My mother heard my voice and rushed into the kitchen.
    <br>After rushing into the kitchen, she found me lying on the floor crying and moaning.
    <br>She called some neighbours who helped her take me to the hospital.
    <br>For several months I received treatment but there was no change.
    <br>My uncle heard that I was sick.
    <br>He was told that I was sick, so he came and checked on me.
    <br>When he came to my place where I lived with my mum,
    <br>he discovered that I was very sick; I was lying in bed.
    <br>He told my mum about The SCOAN.
    <br>My mother accepted and he brought me to The SCOAN.
    <br>He brought me to The SCOAN and I was taken to the prayer line
    <br>and that was where I received my healing.
    <br>As soon as the man of God, Prophet T.B.Joshua prayed for me,
    <br>I began to feel a cold sensation within me.
    <br>What I was not able to do before, I was able to do it.
    <br>For several months, I had been at home, unable to walk on my own.
    <br>I couldn't take my bath or do anything on my own because the pain was too much.
    <br>On that fateful day, I was able to walk; I was so surprised.
    <br>As soon as the man of God prayed for me, I began to walk.
    <br>I was surprised.
    <br>I appreciate God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for saving me!
    <br>For how long have you been healed?
    <br>I have been healed for over 13 years.
    <br>And now, how are you feeling right now?
    <br>I am feeling strong as you can see.
    <br>There is no pain; I no longer feel pain on my leg.
    <br>So you can tap the leg right now?
    <br>Yes, I can tap it. I no longer feel any pain.
    <br>Could you wear trousers like these then?
    <br>Before, I was not able to wear trousers; I would only wear underpants.
    <br>Even the underpants were difficult for me to wear.
    <br>But now I am free. I can wear trousers.
    <br>I can wear whatever I want.
    <br>I am okay; I am strong.
    <br>Mr Jelili Tairu - Healed of Hot Water Burns
    <br>So can you show yourself round to the people.
    <br>Mr Jelili Tairu - Healed of Hot Water Burns
    <br>I would like to tell you that you should have faith in God.
    <br>There is nothing God cannot do.
    <br>You can see what God has done for me in my life.
    <br>Before, I was told in the hospital that my leg would be stiff,
    <br>that I would have been walking like this.
    <br>But now, God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to pray for me and now, I am healed.
    <br>As you can see, my leg is straight.
    <br>I can walk now.
    <br>I no longer feel pain on my leg, as if there were no hot water burns.
    <br>You should have faith in God; there is nothing God cannot do.
    <br>As soon as God uses Prophet T.B. Joshua to pray for you, don't go into sin again.
    <br>Have faith in God. That's all I have to say.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's give a round of applause for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mr Jelili Tairu - Healed of Hot Water Burns
    <br>Right now, we are encouraging you to walk in the light of your testimony
    <br>by staying closer to Jesus Christ because He has healed you to follow Him
    <br>and not to stay where you are.
    <br>So we pray with you that God Almighty will continue to
    <br>uphold you to press on in His way and in His Truth, in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen!
