    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Here is Wise Man Racine moving in the midst of the congregation
    <br>of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations during a typical Sunday Service.
    <br>As he prays, God uses the wise man as an instrument of deliverance
    <br>where there is bondage in the lives of the multitudes.
    <br>And the unclean spirits behind their problems are exposed and forced to come out.
    <br>Indeed, to know God's presence is to know God's power.
    <br>As Wise Man Racine continues to move in the midst of the congregation,
    <br>he prays for this lady who immediately falls to the ground under the superior power of God.
    <br>Let's see what happens in her, following an encounter with Wise Man Racine.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, you unclean spirit, come out of this body!
    <br>The spirit of credit, you cannot remove it.
    <br>Nobody!
    <br>For how long have you been tormenting her life?
    <br>Over 16 years. Nobody can do it.
    <br>Nobody!
    <br>How did you enter her life?
    <br>Through the bush.
    <br>Ancestral spirit - you cannot remove that spirit.
    <br>The spirit of credit - you cannot remove it.
    <br>My ears are blocked.
    <br>Please, my ears.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name, you are free.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ, you heard the voice of the evil spirit
    <br>that it is the spirit of credit, and she has been delivered to the glory of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Esse. I come from Warri (Nigeria).
    <br>I sell food.
    <br>I sell rice, fried rice, jollof rice, salad, chicken, ogwo, eba, egusi, ogbono.
    <br>Everything is sold at my store.
    <br>I sell the food but I don't see the money.
    <br>It's my own money I used to start the business.
    <br>As I sell, I don't see the money; all the money seems to vanish.
    <br>I told my sister that all my money had gone.
    <br>She said I should borrow money.
    <br>I started to borrow money.
    <br>I borrowed to sell food and the money vanished again.
    <br>My sister borrowed money for me.
    <br>She said she sells all sorts of food.
    <br>Whenever she sells food, she doesn't see the result of the products she's selling.
    <br>Instead she keeps on borrowing money,
    <br>to the extent that her sister also assisted her in borrowing money
    <br>in order to make up for the loss she had been making from selling food.
    <br>I borrowed money but I couldn't pay it back.
    <br>People would come to ask for their money and we would fight.
    <br>The father of my children does security work, earning N8,000 a month.
    <br>He said people were coming to fight with him,
    <br>so since he never paid my bride price, I should pack my things and go!
    <br>We've just heard from the woman.
    <br>She said in the course of selling the food stuff she had been cooking,
    <br>she had never made any gain from what she has been selling.
    <br>So she went about borrowing from here and there to the extent that
    <br>her sister also assisted her in borrowing money, in order to make up for the loss
    <br>of selling the food and not making any gains.
    <br>To the point that her husband called her one day and said,
    <br>"Look, I've not even paid for your dowry
    <br>and you go about borrowing money here and there.
    <br>You'd better carry your problem and see how you solve it
    <br>because I'm not ready to carry it for you".
    <br>One day he said he was going to work, took some of his things and ran away.
    <br>I was inside the house with my children.
    <br>All the people I owed would come and some would beat me.
    <br>One day I came out of the house.
    <br>A woman came to my store to buy food.
    <br>The woman said, "Oh, Mama Rice, don't you sell food anymore?"
    <br>I told her I owed debts from my head to my toes.
    <br>She said that to the extent that one day her husband just came in,
    <br>took some of his clothes, and absconded. He ran away from her.
    <br>Since then, those people she had borrowed money from would come.
    <br>They would beat, scold, molest her.
    <br>Then one day a woman met her and said,
    <br>"Look, Madam Rice, you've not been selling food again, why?"
    <br>She told the woman she'd been borrowing money here and there.
    <br>And the woman said, "Look, I've got a solution to your problem".
    <br>The woman gave me an address and said that she knew a man who helped people.
    <br>I said, "Okay, will you take me to him?"
    <br>She said she would not take me there but she wrote the address for me.
    <br>She said if I took the three children, he would solve my problem.
    <br>I said okay.
    <br>She said that if I took my children, the man would solve my problem.
    <br>I agreed.
    <br>I went there and knocked on the door. The gateman said I should enter.
    <br>I entered. I didn't sit down but stood there.
    <br>A man came out of a room.
    <br>He said before I came, they had already told him my problem.
    <br>I said, "Thank God!"
    <br>He said that a person uses what he has to solve his problem.
    <br>I said that if I had something, I would use it to solve my problem.
    <br>He said he wanted to buy this child for N400,000.
    <br>You've listened to the woman.
    <br>She said she met a lady who said she had a solution to her problem.
    <br>She said, no problem, she was ready to do it.
    <br>The lady then said, "When you are going to this place, I will not go with you.
    <br>I will give you the address, but make sure you take your three children along with you".
    <br>She went to the place. Immediately she got there, the security man opened the door for her.
    <br>When she went in, she met a man that said,
    <br>"Look, I already know your problem, and the only solution to your problem is
    <br>you give me one of your children for the sum of N400,000".
    <br>He said he would buy this kid and follow me to the bank to collect the money
    <br>I then said I would not be able to sell him.
    <br>I then walked out of the door.
    <br>He said, "Madam, think about it very well before you die in pain.
    <br>Those people will kill you".
    <br>When I got home, I thought about it.
    <br>My mind told me that I should just drop the child and leave.
    <br>She said after she met the man and he told her,
    <br>"Look, I'm going to buy one of your sons for N 400,000",
    <br>she left and the man said, "Look, you know your problem is so great.
    <br>You'd better think about it and come back to me so that your problem will be solved".
    <br>She said when she left the place, she started thinking about it,
    <br>"Why don't I just drop this child and get the money and solve my problem".
    <br>As I was thinking like that, a woman came. She used to sell garri to me.
    <br>When I didn't have money to pay, she would give food for me and my children to eat.
    <br>I told her that I was going to take this child and solve the problem.
    <br>The woman shouted and said, "Do you want to sell your own child?"
    <br>The money she had earned from selling garri that morning, she lent it to me.
    <br>She said I should use the money for transport and leave Warri immediately.
    <br>I told her that I would not be able to leave at that time
    <br>because the people I was owing would know I was running away.
    <br>She said that I should go to sleep like somebody who had not heard anything.
    <br>As the day was breaking, I woke up the children. I told them we were going to Lagos
    <br>but I didn't know where we were going in Lagos.
    <br>I said we were going to Lagos.
    <br>My daughter asked me, "Mommy, where are we going?"
    <br>I said, "If they kill us, we die; if they don't kill us, we live".
    <br>She said while she was thinking about going back to the man
    <br>to collect the sum of N400,000 to sell her son to the man,
    <br>a woman met her who had been assisting her, giving her food.
    <br>She asked, "Why are you crying? What is the problem?"
    <br>She said, "Look, I met a man who wants to buy my son for N400,000 so I could pay my debt".
    <br>The woman told her, "No, you dont need to do that. I'm going to assist you,
    <br>give you some money so that you can travel down to Lagos".
    <br>When I was leaving at 2 am, I woke up these children.
    <br>I brought some cheap plastic bags and put their clothes in before we left.
    <br>We started at 2 AM and crossed a bridge.
    <br>That day, I thought we would die.
    <br>When we got to Osarame Park, I cried out.
    <br>The manager asked me, "Madam, what brought you here this early morning?"
    <br>I started crying and told him I was on the run
    <br>and that I owed debts from my head to my toes.
    <br>I told him that I wanted to sell my child.
    <br>He said, "No, just run to The SCOAN and that God would answer you".
    <br>After that, the man booked tickets for me to get here for free.
    <br>She said that after she left at midnight because she thought
    <br>the people she was owing money to would arrest her or think she was running away,
    <br>The woman told her, "Look, very early morning go to the park".
    <br>When she got to the park, she didn't have money to travel on the bus to Lagos.
    <br>That was how she met the manager of the transport company.
    <br>The man asked her, "Madam, why are you standing here with these little children at this hour?"
    <br>She told the man, "Look, I'm about to sell my child for N400,000".
    <br>The man said, "No, you don't need to do that.
    <br>Enter the bus for free and travel down to Lagos".
    <br>And that's how she came down to The SCOAN.
    <br>Since she has been delivered, these children need to be given scholarship.
    <br>Also, we are to give her N400,000 so she can pay her debts.
    <br>And give them 5 bags of rice.
    <br>This is what my whole family could not pay.
    <br>For the rest of my life, they could not pay this money.
    <br>I want to challenge the congregation to come together.
    <br>Apart from this N400,000, contribute at least N100,000 for her to continue her business.
    <br>This money is to pay the debts.
    <br>Five bags of rice and scholarships - the church will give that.
    <br>We should come together and give another N100,000 for her to start her business.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I thank the man of God for what he has done for me.
    <br>My whole generation could not pay. My brothers and sisters could not pay.
    <br>I thank God for today!
    <br>Help me thank God and the man of God.
    <br>We have people like this in the society.
    <br>If these children are not cared for, they will become another thing in the future.
    <br>What can we do for you, sir?
    <br>I came from Warri too. I want to assist her with N100,000.
    <br>You want to give her N100,000?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Can you see what I'm talking about?
    <br>Many who are here today are crying in their spirit and soul.
    <br>They know they can do better than what they are doing.
    <br>Look at this woman from Warri.
    <br>We have people here from the Eastern communities to this place who are millionaires
    <br>but they cannot help her.
    <br>They keep helping others who will say, "Thank you"
    <br>because they have nothing to gain from this woman.
    <br>She's not a young lady; they cannot go out with her.
    <br>She has children; they cannot marry her.
    <br>There's nothing you can do; she will become a burden to them.
    <br>You can't put her in your office to be your clerk or manager.
    <br>You can't send her on any errand. So they feel helping her is of no use.
    <br>These are the kind of people you should raise.
    <br>We come from different backgrounds.
    <br>Today is Sunday; yesterday was Saturday.
    <br>Many came from parties where they danced and displayed money.
    <br>Many from clubs - social clubs, community clubs, different backgrounds.
    <br>Many went to weddings yesterday, or funerals.
    <br>In those places, they displayed money; they showed off money.
    <br>But here is the house of God.
    <br>Why can't we let the world know the value of money?
    <br>The real value of money is to help our fellow brothers.
    <br>You are blessed to bless others.
    <br>That is the real value.
    <br>The real value is to help the needy.
    <br>You are because I am; I am because you are.
    <br>Where I'm weak, you are strong; where I'm strong, you are weak.
    <br>So what we are doing now is to tell you that,
    <br>when you leave here today,
    <br>don't let your fellow brother come to you and say, "I need your help".
    <br>Even at the house where you are living,
    <br>how can you see little children on Monday, Tuesday roaming about?
    <br>And you cannot ask them, "Are you not going to school?
    <br>What are you doing at home?"
    <br>By the time you meet the parents, they will tell you,
    <br>"We are very sorry, we cannot afford the school fees".
    <br>Come to their aid.
    <br>In many homes you are living in,
    <br>every day, the tenants fight with the landlords.
    <br>You always hear their voices.
    <br>Why can't you come to their aid and ask the landlord what the problem is.
    <br>The landlord would say, "The problem is that he refuses to pay house rent".
    <br>Why can't you call the tenant,
    <br>"What is the problem? Do you want to live here? How much do you need?"
    <br>Help; settle them down. Don't allow this marriage to lead to divorce.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The reason why we are doing this is to change your perception, belief and philosophy.
    <br>What you are used to is to give those who can give you, who appreciate you.
    <br>You love appreciation.
    <br>We just received a phone call on one of our prayer lines,
    <br>by one of the viewers who was watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>and he saw the woman, listened to her pathetic story,
    <br>the woman who was delivered from the spirit of credit
    <br>and the man of God blessed her with the sum of N400,000.
    <br>The man said he's ready to pay her house rent and take care of her for one whole year.
    <br>The SCOAN and Emmanuel TV cannot go anywhere without the ministry of giving.
    <br>And what are we giving?
    <br>Love, strength, faithfulness, kindness, goodness,
    <br>every good thing the Lord has given us, money.
    <br>That is another ministry.
    <br>We must give it unconditionally.
    <br>Your money must have a place it's going to to raise the standard of living for the glory of God.
    <br>Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.
    <br>That is Christianity. It's all about relationship.
    <br>Tell you neighbour, "Christianity is all about relationship.
    <br>Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man".
    <br>My name is Esse, I came from Warri.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of credit.
    <br>I owed but could not pay.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, I was sitting inside the church.
    <br>When the wise men were coming, my body began to shake.
    <br>I didn't know what they carried in their hands that made me shake.
    <br>Before I knew it, I found myself in front of the altar.
    <br>The man of God was asking, "Where is the woman who owes debt?"
    <br>She said that when she came here, she had an encounter with Wise Man Racine,
    <br>and the evil spirit that was in her life, the spirit of credit, was provoked,
    <br>and she was delivered from that spirit of credit.
    <br>Since the deliverance that day, my body feels so light.
    <br>There was a huge man who used to come to my dreams.
    <br>The last time the man came, after sleeping with me,
    <br>he used a handkerchief to clean up my body.
    <br>The day the wise man delivered me, I felt so free; I slept like a baby.
    <br>Today when I told the man of God my problem, the man of God told me
    <br>he would give me money and give my children scholarships.
    <br>Today, the man of God gave me the sum of N400,000
    <br>and a member of the church gave me N100,000,
    <br>which is N500,000 and five bags of rice.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team promised me an apartment and feeding for one year.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ! What an incredible transformation
    <br>that is taking place in her life.
    <br>She said that when she came here, the man of God, T.B. Joshua,
    <br>gave her the sum of N400,000 to pay off her debt.
    <br>Not only that, a member of the congregation came out
    <br>and blessed her with the sum of N100,000
    <br>to combine it together to pay off all her debt as well.
    <br>Not only that, she was also blessed with scholarship for her children
    <br>Not only that, she was also blessed with scholarships for her children and five bags of rice.
    <br>And if that wasn't enough, a person called the Emmanuel TV prayer line
    <br>and said that they wanted to sponsor and pay for her accomodation - her rent for an entire year.
    <br>I feel so happy because my whole generation couldn't pay the money.
    <br>May God guide him and his family
    <br>and give him long life and prosperity.
    <br>We want to encourage you to make God's Word the standard for your lives
    <br>so that your source of income can continue to come from God Almighty,
    <br>and make Jesus Christ the boss, the CEO, the director of all you do in life.
    <br>As you do so, your way will be prosperous and successful.
    <br>Anything you put your hand to will be prosperous in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Amen.
