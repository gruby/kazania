  <h3>
    1901
  </h3>
  <p>    
    <br>My name is John Okoh, I'm a native of Cross River State.
    <br>I had a case with my management in 1989.
    <br>I was a storekeeper with a construction firm affiliated with the NDA (Nigerian Defence Academy)
    <br>in Kaduna State, Nigeria.
    <br>I was with the company for over six years.
    <br>I was given sick leave for two weeks on 2nd September 1989
    <br>to travel home so that I would take care of myself.
    <br>On the 17th before coming back, I was arrested and taken to the police station,
    <br>State CID Kaduna, for the reason that I collaborated with twenty armed robbers
    <br>to rob my department.
    <br>I was later tried by the military tribunal
    <br>and sentenced to death by hanging.
    <br>After a one year interval, I was commuted to life imprisonment.
    <br>All this while, I was in Kaduna State prison.
    <br>Until last year October, I was transferred to Calabar Prison.
    <br>In Calabar Prison, there is what we call 'Emmanuel Day', that is the 'T.B. Joshua Day'.
    <br>We would watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We were watching the television at that time and the man of God prophesied.
    <br>That was the first time I came across the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I had never come across him before over the 22 years I was in prison.
    <br>I had lost my freedom.
    <br>That day, I heard the man of God prophesy that some people were in prison
    <br>and someone there was about to be set free.
    <br>I jumped up and said I was the one; I claimed it.
    <br>After two weeks, the Governor of Cross River State sent a note
    <br>that all the names of the inmates should be compiled and sent to his office for freedom.
    <br>All of us that were watching that programme were ten in number.
    <br>All of us were serving life imprisonment.
    <br>When the Governor saw the list, all the ten of us who were imprisoned for life
    <br>that were watching Emmanuel TV, including myself, were released.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As I went back home, I told myself that if I didn't come back to testify to
    <br>the goodness of what the Lord has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to prophesy concerning my life, it would be bad.
    <br>Many have tried to get me out of that position, but it was impossible.
    <br>Until this day, after 22 years in prison, I find myself a free man.
    <br>I stand before you as brethren to tell you that it is good for everybody,
    <br>even those in the prison, to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>By the grace of God, through the man of God and Emmanuel TV
    <br>many people are receiving their healing in prison.
    <br>And so sir, may God who has given you this great commission continue to lead you.
    <br>Sir, this is a photo of my prison cell.
    <br>Emmanuel TV and Partners all over the world, we give 200 thousand Naira.
    <br>Thank you, man of God. Thank you, sir.
    <br>Give him five bags of rice.
    <br>We don't want you to jump into society the way you find society.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua along with the support of our Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>gave a cash gift of 200 thousand Naira and five bags of rice to Mr. John Okoh,
    <br>to start his life afresh in Christ Jesus.
    <br>But by the grace of God, God has channelled the man of God,
    <br>to pray and prophesy for my freedom.
    <br>Today I am a free man.
    <br>What the man of God has given me today is enough to start
    <br>my new beginning.
    <br>It is a great privilege for me to say that I am starting a brand new life.
    <br>God has blessed me with the sum of 200 thousand Naira and five bags of rice.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
