    <br>NOTICE FROM THE SCOAN
    <br>A Good Christian Is A Good Citizen
    <br>NOTICE: Viewers, listen to your government and obey the instructions given to you.
    <br> For example, instructions concerning gathering at this time.
    <br>They are authorities established by God (Romans 13).
    <br>A good Christian is a good citizen.
    <br>Whatever life brings, you are not alone.
    <br>We are on our knees praying for you and your nation.
    <br>God bless you as you obey. Jesus is Lord!
    <br>The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
