    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>My name is Mary Okoye.
    <br>The woman standing next to me is my mum and the others are my sisters.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of the Lord in my life which all started last Sunday during the prophecy.
    <br>The man of God came up to me; he told me that I had the spirit of woman,
    <br>that a spiritual woman transplanted herself into me and that since then I have only had affection for women.
    <br>I confirm it to be true because from a tender age, I had always been 'masculine'.
    <br>I was always saying that when I grew up, I didn't want to have breasts
    <br>but rather I wanted to get married to a woman - and things like that.
    <br>As I grew, the spirit grew along with me until it got to a point that I had to start practising it.
    <br>My mum is here for the first time and she is hearing this for the first time as well.
    <br>I remember she used to look at me with a mother's eye and ask me, "Are you sure you are not gay?"
    <br>I would then be hearing a voice telling me to deny it, and I would tell her, "Mum, I am not."
    <br>She would ask me again whether I was sure and I would confirm I was not gay.
    <br>It continued like that.
    <br>I tried fighting the spirit with my own physical strength but it failed me.
    <br>That was the problem that brought me to The SCOAN to seek for deliverance.
    <br>I only had affection for women.
    <br>The spirit destroyed my life and my academics because I was easily fished out from the crowd.
    <br>I encountered cultism problems and I had to leave the school.
    <br>Because of the spirit, anything I touched turned back to nothing.
    <br>And I only had affection for women like me.
    <br>As a result of the way I dressed, as I walked by people would think I was a guy.
    <br>I only had affection for women and I never had any encounter with a man.
    <br>All my life I had just been like that.
    <br>It was last Sunday that the man of God prophesied to me.
    <br>He asked me of my 'second'.
    <br>She came out; that was my partner.
    <br>But now, I don't see myself having any affection whatsoever towards her.
    <br>I see her as my fellow girl and as my sister.
    <br>After the prayer I received on Sunday, I don't have any affection for her whatsoever.
    <br>I see her as my fellow female and my sister.
    <br>Now that you don't have affection for her, what is your affection towards now?
    <br>A person must have affection.
    <br>Since last Sunday, I have come in touch with my feminine side, irrespective of how I dress.
    <br>I now have affection for men.
    <br>If a guy walked by I would think he was handsome and I pray one day I will get married to a guy like that.
    <br>Can you rise up and give thanks to God?
    <br>Give thanks to God!
    <br>Just as people give thanks to God for your breakthrough, give thanks to God,
    <br>that the Lord should continue to do more of this, using people to do this, to deliver people all over the world.
    <br>Give thanks to God and demand for the grace all over the world, that God should continue to use people.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray.
    <br>Because we need more people all over the world who God will be using to release people.
    <br>Like I have said, satan causes people to lose control.
    <br>God can continue to release people; just as you are released, others too want to be released.
    <br>She said right from a small age, imagine it, the thing came upon her.
    <br>And God will continue to use people all over the world because we need more people
    <br>that God will use to release, to do this - more and more -
    <br>instead of condemnation, instead of attack.
    <br>There is no condemnation in the Good News, no condemnation at all.
    <br>Instead of condemnation, saying, "You have a problem", where you isolate them and shout at them.
    <br>No! A problem is a problem.
    <br>A headache can kill; cancer can kill.
    <br>HIV can kill; leg pain can kill.
    <br>A problem is a problem!
    <br>You are the one who looks at one problem as a small one and another one as a big one.
    <br>The same God that says, "Thou shalt not lie", also says, "Thou shalt not murder".
    <br>If you have murdered people, you have lied, and if you have lied, you are a murderer.
    <br>The solution to the world now is love, real love.
    <br>Real love forgets wrong.
    <br>Real love - if you love, you will not hate.
    <br>You will not segregate.
    <br>Can you see what God is doing?
    <br>With love, ease; with hate, violence.
    <br>- Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>- With love ease; with hate, violence.
    <br>- I can't hear you.
    <br>- With love ease; with hate, violence.
    <br>If you love someone, whatever you do is 'with ease'.
    <br>If you want to give money to the person you love, it is with a smile.
    <br>If care is not taken, you will even say, "Thank you for receiving this money", because you love the person -
    <br>"I never believed you would receive this; thank you."
    <br>But when you hate, no matter what you want to give... [complaining sounds].
    <br>With love, ease; with hate, violence.
    <br>Thank you very much, you may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It has gone; it was a spirit.
    <br>When you see her in another 2-3 weeks, the appearance will have changed.
    <br>No (need to clap) - because it is a thing of the spirit.
    <br>So, you were telling me that your affection is now towards the right direction?
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>I want to assure you, that affection will now remould you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>In just two weeks time, you will astonish yourself.
    <br>Amen; thank You, Jesus; thank you, man of God.
