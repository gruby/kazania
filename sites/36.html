  <p>    
    <br>This is the case of Mr. and Mrs. Sprank, who came all the way from Germany to The SCOAN,
    <br>for a healing touch from our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>This is T.B. Joshua praying for those in attendance at the prayer line that Sunday.
    <br>He turns to Mr. and Mrs. Sprank.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Immediately at the mention of the name "Jesus Christ", the evil spirit in Mr. Sprank begins to react.
    <br>Satan is a defeated foe and he knows it.
    <br>Try though he may, it is the vanquished that flee before the victors.
    <br>Jesus Christ has given overcoming victory to all who are truly born-again.
    <br>The evil spirit cannot stand the fire of God's holiness, and the light of His purity.
    <br>This is no ordinary battle, but spirit against spirit.
    <br>The evil spirit inside Mr. Sprank wants to fight back.
    <br>It is what the Bible calls "stiff opposition".
    <br>Greater is He who is in us than all the forces that can be arrayed against us.
    <br>Watch what is happening.
    <br>Bowing to the authority in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>All the way from Germany.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>But it is foolish to think that inferior can defeat superior.
    <br>If you talk what you believe, satan has to listen.
    <br>And we know that when we rise up in faith in Jesus' name, satan must bow.
    <br>T.B. Joshua continues to administer spirit deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Satan is powerless in the face of God's armour and power.
    <br>This is the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, powerful to pull down every fortress of satan.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The Holy Spirit affects our words.
    <br>He uses our words as the weapon to bring deliverance, salvation, and all of God's blessings.
    <br>This man's body shakes and trembles under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>There is a gentleman who came all the way from Germany, right now being set free.
    <br>The Bible says that Jesus Christ is the Master-Healer.
    <br>In the time of His earthly ministry He gave commands to evil spirits that kill, steal, and destroy
    <br>to leave the lives of their victims, and they obeyed.
    <br>As it was, so it is.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>This is the power of God at work.
    <br>While T.B. Joshua continues to pray, the demonic powers in Mr. Sprank begin to manifest,
    <br>as a part of the deliverance process.
    <br>There is more to life than meets the ordinary eyes.
    <br>Different parts, different animals I'm removing from his system.
    <br>Take note of the characteristics of those animals.
    <br>You can know the animal that walks like this.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>The SCOAN Prayer Line
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Still under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit, T.B. Joshua approaches him, takes his hand
    <br>raises him to his feet and embraces him.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>The man has been set free.
    <br>You are now free.
    <br>You possessed powers and you are delivered from these.
    <br>OK, these are generational curses.
    <br>Powers, reptiles and pythons.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I’m free. Finally, I’m free.
    <br>That's my husband.
    <br>What do you say?
    <br>He is my husband.
    <br>You must have been taking note of some strange powers.
    <br>I do.
    <br>How?
    <br>In his behaviour.
    <br>He is always very angry, over nothing.
    <br>He just gets angry.
    <br>In the night, you just see him wake up.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>And when he wakes up, you just wake up and you see him sitting down.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>You begin to ask yourself, ‘Why is he sitting down?’
    <br>He does it sometimes.
    <br>That is the time he is operating with that kind of powers.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>That is the wife to the man that has just been delivered.
    <br>Having delivered Mr. Sprank, T.B. Joshua now prays for Mrs. Sprank in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>to heal past hurts and enable them to build a happy Christian home together.
    <br>She rises to her feet completely free.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Thorsten Sprank, my age is 42 years. I come from Germany.
    <br>What was the problem you were having before?
    <br>I’ve had the feeling for several years that I have some negative spirits
    <br>which make me unbalanced and lacking energy.
    <br>I never really operate on the full level of my possibilities.
    <br>They also make me sometimes aggressive without a real reason.
    <br>So, I’ve felt uncomfortable in life with something trying to keep me down.
    <br>I came here for a solution.
    <br>My relationships have had a lot of conflict because of my anger.
    <br>This has all impacted my daily life because I don’t have enough energy for the things I'm doing.
    <br>You were privileged to be placed at the prayer line of The SCOAN.
    <br>What actually happened there, when you had an encounter with Jesus Christ,
    <br>through His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Can you explain what actually happened there?
    <br>When the man of God started praying for me, these negative forces became
    <br>very visible, with more presence than I have experienced before.
    <br>I became aggressive and thought I had to fight them, to keep them at distance,
    <br>so that they would not overwhelm me and take control.
    <br>So, I started fighting against them, which gave me the feeling that I can keep them at distance.
    <br>It was only after a while that I became aware again of the presence of the man of God.
    <br>I looked for his support to release me from these spirits.
    <br>That was when he directed me and I was forced several times to the floor, and he touched my back.
    <br>Every time he did that I felt a big relief that something was leaving my body and I came to peace.
    <br>My intention was not to fight against the man of God but rather the opposite -
    <br>against the darkness and negative forces, where they seem to have their source, their origin.
    <br>It was not my own will. It was a reaction as I was trying to fight for solution for myself as I did before,
    <br>but I came here to get the healing through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Only after some time we connected to him to look for support.
    <br>It was an unintended reaction as I tried to find a solution for myself at the beginning.
    <br>Immediately after the prayer, I felt disoriented as if waking from a long deep sleep
    <br>but now I feel more balanced and at peace
    <br>with a strength inside, giving me support and guiding my life.
    <br>Are you still having that aggressive nature in you?
    <br>No, not anymore.
    <br>So, you are completely delivered from it?
    <br>Yes, I am delivered in Jesus' name. Amen.
    <br>I am Rebecca Sprank, I am 36 years old.
    <br>Everything he said is true. He gets very angry and irritated over nothing.
    <br>Because we always watch Emmanuel TV, he believed he would be delivered
    <br>by Prophet T.B. Joshua and I believed it so strongly because I’ve seen mighty miracles
    <br>that God has used him to do.
    <br>I know he’s God’s servant.
    <br>He is God's general.
    <br>At a point I told my husband I wanted to be out of the marriage,
    <br>that I was happier before I met him.
    <br>He said I should give him an opportunity to come here to be prayed for by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>That was why we made our trip all the way from Germany to come here.
    <br>I thank God so much because immediately the man of God prayed for him, there was a visible reaction.
    <br>One can see that the negative forces in him that made him not to be himself encountered a stronger power,
    <br>which is the Spirit of God and immediately there was a reaction.
    <br>Like he explained - he is free. I thank God, he is free.
    <br>There is power in Christ and this power is obviously present in Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>It is not something anybody can dispute because what happened is a confirmation of the fact
    <br> that he is anointed for our generation.
    <br>I thank God that my husband is free.
    <br>Because ordinarily he wouldn't have...
    <br>Everything he explained is an indication that this man is God's general.
    <br>There is no doubt about it.
    <br>For me it is really Jesus Christ walking on earth through the man of God.
    <br>People looking for help or healing, before trying hospitals,
    <br>they should look for the real Healer, who is Jesus Christ.
    <br>I thank God for my healing and my promise to God is to sin no more
    <br>and I want to increase my involvement in the local church.
    <br>My promise to God is to continually talk about His goodness and to go and sin no more.
    <br>I pray with you that the Lord Almighty will grant you the grace to live above sin, in Jesus' name. Amen.
