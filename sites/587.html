  <p>    
    <br>How many people do you have, are you caring for?
    <br>Don't say, "Until I have 'big'."
    <br>There are fatherless, orphans, poor.
    <br>Help!
    <br>You think of the 'huge' money you are spending.
    <br>Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>Your money cannot speak for you, but these are the people that will speak for you.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch This And APPRECIATE LIFE!!!
    <br>Your house cannot speak for you.
    <br>Your property cannot speak for you.
    <br>Trillions of dollars and pounds and naira cannot speak for you.
    <br>People want to change.
    <br>People want to succeed.
    <br>People want to improve in life.
    <br>They are fatherless, so that you can be their father.
    <br>What are you doing to affect the society?
    <br>What have you done and what are you doing?
    <br>Coming forward are some of the physically challenged university students.
    <br>Despite the difficulties and hindrances they face in life,
    <br>they have not given up, they have not given in.
    <br>They believe they are created in the image of God to be a success.
    <br>Among them are the blind, the crippled, those who use crutches
    <br>and those who crawl on their hands and knees.
    <br>These students study during the day and beg to make ends meet in the night.
    <br>They are here today to receive the scholarships promised them by T.B. Joshua,
    <br>which they hope will put an end to their former lives of begging and hardship.
    <br>Let's listen to them.
    <br>My name is Adams Surajudeen Abiodun.
    <br>I am a student of Adekunale Ajasin University, Ondo State.
    <br>I am in the faculty of science in that school.
    <br>I'm studying computer science.
    <br>I'm in the 300 level right now.
    <br>Since I was admitted into this school, I've been struggling, begging to gain my school fees.
    <br>My accommodation is also a problem.
    <br>Feeding is also a problem.
    <br>When I heard that pastor T.B. Joshua is giving money to the needy, widows, physically challenged like us,
    <br>and that he sponsors the physically challenged with scholarships,
    <br>that was why I came here.
    <br>I believe that by the grace of God, the man of God is ready to settle all the problems I'm having.
    <br>Look at the effort it takes him to move a single step.
    <br>Can you imagine?
    <br>A human being God created in His own image,
    <br>and you have your money in your bank account, fleet of cars,
    <br>houses everywhere, trillions of dollars, pounds, naira in your savings account, deposits in the bank.
    <br>And the human being born of God is begging to go to school.
    <br>Just tell us what you need in university.
    <br>By the grace of God, T.B. Joshua promises his full support to Mr. Adams.
    <br>That is his ID card at Adekunle Ajasin University.
    <br>My name is Ms. Ibeabuchi Onyinyechi.
    <br>I'm doing my Masters grade in Abia State University, Uturu.
    <br>I'm having accommodation, school fees and feeding problems in the school,
    <br>as a physically challenged person.
    <br>So, when I heard that Prophet T.B. Joshua is helping the physically challenged persons,
    <br>the widows, the widowers, the dwarfs and the less privileged,
    <br>I decided to come here all the way from Abia State,
    <br>hoping that by the grace of God, God is going to use Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to change my destiny.
    <br>And today I'm happy that I'm here.
    <br>And I believe that God in His infinite mercy will help me
    <br>because in the school dormitory, school hostel, lavatory and bedroom that is very dirty
    <br>I use my hands, as a physically challenged person to march.
    <br>I walk like this to the school.
    <br>I also reached here, to help me in mobility.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>- This is how you go to school?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>See the pitiful way Ms. Onyinyechi, an economics Masters degree student of Abia State University
    <br>demonstrates how she has to walk due to her disability.
    <br>Imagine what it must be like having to crawl around the university campus just like this.
    <br>She mentioned that this is even the way she has to go the university's toilets,
    <br>where she will have to use her hands to support herself,
    <br>while walking through the unhygienic, often urine-stained floors.
    <br>You study what?
    <br>I'm studying economics, I'm doing my Masters degree in economics.
    <br>I read economics in my first degree too.
    <br>Now, you are part of us, we are part of you.
    <br>Please, you have to give your best and the Lord will support you.
    <br>We want to take your case up financially, physically, spiritually.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I'm most grateful.
    <br>So, we will pay your school fees, we will give you a scholarship to school,
    <br>and when you come out of university and you have the best grades,
    <br>you will tell us where you would like to go and how you would like to go about it.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I'm grateful.
    <br>We are giving them two point something million - the school fees for all.
    <br>The man of God T.B. Joshua said that he is going to pay for all of these students' school fees,
    <br>which adds up to more than two million naira.
    <br>Touched by the frequent gestures of Christ's loving generosity,
    <br>one of the church members has something to say.
    <br>I don't know what to say right now, papa.
    <br>You are so good...
    <br>No no no. I'm doing this so that you too can go out and do the same.
    <br>I will do it, papa.
    <br>I will do it.
    <br>I'm challenging you.
    <br>We are not doing it to display them.
    <br>God will bless you for that.
    <br>I will do the same thing that you are doing.
    <br>Because it is one of the criteria to the Kingdom.
    <br>When you go home - if it is just one - look for them.
    <br>If you cannot care for the fatherless, look for the aged - care for them, give them clothes.
    <br>Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>If you want a good life for your own children, want a good life for other people's children.
    <br>That is the secret.
    <br>You want a good life for your own children, you want them to prosper - 
    <br>wish other children prosperity and see whether your own children will not prosper.
    <br>If you go back home, open your store.
    <br>You will see many things unused.
    <br>It is true, sir.
    <br>Go and sell them.
    <br>Put that money together, give it to the fatherless.
    <br>I will do this right from today.
    <br>I promise you, papa.
    <br>You are my man of God.
    <br>I promise you, I will do it from today.
    <br>Thank you, father.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch This And APPRECIATE LIFE!!!
    <br>You can imagine the pain and embarrassment these students face daily,
    <br>that constant struggle for their education, accommodation and welfare,
    <br>as a result of their various physical challenges.
    <br>Having listened to their various experiences, trials and requests,
    <br>the man of God, T.B. Joshua gave each of the physically challenged students
    <br>a scholarship to pay for their accommodation and school fees.
    <br>T.B. Joshua further gave a gift of 15,000 naira each for their feeding expenses.
    <br>With a quality smile now lightening their faces and displaying the gifts of T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the students are overjoyed.
    <br>But that is not all.
    <br>A special wheelchair was provided for Ms. Onyinyechi of Abia State University
    <br>so that she will be able to move more comfortably.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I'm so grateful.
    <br>I'm very happy.
    <br>I'm so grateful.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Overwhelmed by the generosity of Jesus Christ, she burst into tears
    <br>at the very large welcome gift.
    <br>As she is gently lifted into the wheelchair, her tears of joy are mixed with thanksgiving.
    <br>Ultimately, we are called to respond to all human needs,
    <br>for that is what love entails.
    <br>In addition to the scholarships and feeding allowances,
    <br>T.B. Joshua gave each of the students two bags of rice to take back with them to the university,
    <br>to see them through, until the next meeting.
    <br>Congratulations.
    <br>And I want to say thank you very much for accepting me as your friend.
    <br>Thank you for accepting me as your friend.
    <br>It is a real privilege having you as my friend.
    <br>Thank you very much for accepting my offer.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>I'm very happy.
    <br>God bless you, sir.
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>The man of God embraces each of his new friends,
    <br>showing his love with a holy kiss, thanking them for accepting him as a friend,
    <br>saying that he sees it as a real privilege to be their friend,
    <br>and to be in a position to give.
    <br>The man of God's affectionate gesture is deeply felt.
    <br>This record is not in any way suggesting that we have arrived,
    <br>rather it is challenging you to do the same.
    <br>Endeavouring to copy the example of Christ, who is never tired of doing good,
    <br>remember, someone is somewhere waiting for you for a lifetime
    <br>to put a quality smile on their faces.
    <br>How many lives are you capable of changing?
    <br>How many lives have you changed?
    <br>I thank God for what the man of God has done for everyone of us,
    <br>because he has fulfilled the promise that Jesus said.
    <br>He said, "When I was hungry, you gave me food.
    <br>When I was naked, you clothed me."
    <br>Because we don't have money to go to school,
    <br>our pastor Joshua had given us money to go to school.
    <br>He has fulfilled the promise of God.
    <br>He gave me 115,000 plus 15,000 for a feeding allowance.
    <br>I'm very grateful.
    <br>God will continue to bless him and his ministry will keep growing, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I thank you very much.
    <br>We should see giving as the reason for relationship
    <br>Just as receiving is the reason for a relationship as well
    <br>When we give we receive
    <br>More of whatever we give
    <br>When we give we are planting
    <br>Seeds that will be multiplied back to us
    <br>Every true friendship in Christ Jesus must be mutual trust mutual faith mutual love
    <br>Coming forward are physically challenged students,
    <br>beneficiaries of The SCOAN's scholarship programme.
    <br>They come using crutches, in wheelchairs, guided by the hand and even crawling on the floor.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, deeply involved in the business of benefaction,
    <br>has been supporting these physically challenged students, and many more for so long.
    <br>My name is Mrs Onyinyechi Chinedu Onoele, formally known as Miss Ibeabuchi Onyinyechi.
    <br>The handsome man standing beside me is my husband.
    <br>I have come here today to testify to the goodness of the Lord in our lives.
    <br>After my first degree course in Abia State University,
    <br>I had intentions of going back to school for my Masters degree
    <br>but I had a lot of financial constraints and also mobility problems.
    <br>When I met with the man of God, my life turned around for the best.
    <br>He sponsored my Masters degree programme, paid my school fees and accommodation fees.
    <br>He also gave me this wheelchair that has solved my mobility problem
    <br>and now, I can move without any problem.
    <br>My mobility problem is over.
    <br>Very soon, I will conclude my Masters degree programme in Abia State University.
    <br>God being so kind, He blessed me with a wonderful man, beyond my imagination.
    <br>I never knew that I could get married but God being so kind,
    <br>blessed me with this young man here.
    <br>He loves me so much and went ahead to marry me.
    <br>I want to thank God in a special way.
    <br>Remember that day there was a promise that she would be given a car.
    <br>Let us see the vehicle outside for her.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch This And APPRECIATE LIFE!!!
    <br>Overcome with joy, Mrs Onyinyechi takes a look at the luxurious, automatic car,
    <br>of which she is now the proud owner.
    <br>Her mobility problems are a thing of the past.
    <br>The secret of joy and peace is to share with others.
    <br>No matter how small, share with others.
    <br>And when you are sharing with them, don't give them what you do not need.
    <br>Give them what your life depends on, what you cherish, not what you do not need.
    <br>Thank you very much, man of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>When a man is overwhelmed and flabbergasted at the same time,
    <br>he becomes "flabberwhelmed"!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I really want to bless the name of the Lord;
    <br>He has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to affect the life of my wife positively.
    <br>He has wiped away so many tears from her face
    <br>and I am very grateful to God Almighty and to you.
    <br>You are indeed a father.
    <br>May the name of the Lord be blessed.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We are going to give them 200,000 naira to fuel the car.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch This And APPRECIATE LIFE!!!
    <br>Mrs Onyinyechi smiles as she holds the key and documents, which are her proof of ownership.
    <br>On the instruction of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the sum of 200,000 naira is given to Mrs Onyinyechi and her husband
    <br>to purchase fuel for their brand new car.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Mrs Onyinyechi Chinedu Onoele.
    <br>We came from Abia State.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband, Mr Onoele Victor.
    <br>I have come to testify what the Lord has been doing in my life
    <br>through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The man of God blessed me with a brand new car, a Honda and 200,000 naira for fuel.
    <br>We are so grateful to God.
    <br>The particulars are here, as you can see my husband has them and the car keys are also here.
    <br>We bless the name of God for using Prophet T.B. Joshua to affect my life positively.
    <br>We thank God for what He is using the man of God to do in the lives of physically challenged people
    <br>and also in the lives of the less privileged people in the whole world.
    <br>The assistance that the man of God has been giving to me all this while
    <br>has affected my life so positively.
    <br>I'm going to school without tears.
    <br>God has used him immensely to affect my life and I thank God for using him.
    <br>And by the time God Almighty places you in a higher position of influence,
    <br>what would you do, going by the lessons you have learn from the experience?
    <br>By the grace of God, I will affect the lives of other people
    <br>who are less privileged and the physically challenged.
    <br>People that are beggars on the street - I will put smiles on their faces
    <br>because I have been blessed and I have learnt how to bless others.
    <br>What message do you have for people who are listening to you right now,
    <br>going by what God Almighty has used the man of God and the people of God to do in your life?
    <br>For people who are listening to me, I want to tell you to always trust in God,
    <br>be steadfast that one day, God is going to use someone to affect your lives.
    <br>Don't give in even if you are physically challenged.
    <br>Just put your trust in the Lord.
    <br>God will visit you one day and turn your life around for the best.
    <br>My name is Mr Onoele Victor Chinedu.
    <br>I'm a quantity surveyor by profession.
    <br>I lecture in Abia State Polytechnic.
    <br>I am here today to bless the name of the Lord for using the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua to affect and bless the life of my wife positively.
    <br>We are happily married.
    <br>We wedded on the 25th of September, 2010.
    <br>Today, the Lord has done a wonderful thing in our lives by using the man of God
    <br>to bless us with a Honda Acura car and the sum of 200,000 naira.
    <br>As I said earlier, I am highly "flabberwhelmed"!
    <br>I am short of words but I give God the glory.
    <br>I am so grateful to God Almighty.
    <br>He has been a wonderful God.
    <br>Ever since we got married, we have been living in peace
    <br>and we enjoy the peace of God.
    <br>We are now car owners!
    <br>We bless Him so much.
    <br>We thank God and we thank Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We pray that the Lord will strengthen him the more.
    <br>The message I have for the people, the viewers all over the world is that...
    <br>I want to start from my wife's side.
    <br>There is ability in disability.
    <br>A lot of people feel rejected simply because they are physically challenged.
    <br>I want to say that she is very serious minded and positive,
    <br>despite her being physically challenged.
    <br>She is hard working and intelligent and is moving towards greatness.
    <br>I encourage others out there, never to give up.
    <br>As the man of God said, "Whether you are physically challenged or not,
    <br>the Lord can use anybody and the Lord blesses all His people."
    <br>I encourage them not to give up.
    <br>In every situation, there is hope.
    <br>We want to encourage you, now that you have been highly favoured by God Almighty,
    <br>to make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>The Bible says those who are blessed by Christ's Word must be ruled by His Word.
    <br>As you continue to make His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>and for your family the blessing of God will continue to increase,
    <br>and the grace of God will continue to abound in your life.
    <br>And we can be proud to say, "Better is not good enough; the best is yet to come!"
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will continue to strengthen you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>After thanking God for His abundant provision in their lives,
    <br>Mrs Onyinyechi and her husband take a closer look at their new car.
    <br>Already in the driving seat, with her hands on the wheel,
    <br>Mrs Onyinyechi is ready for action.
    <br>She waves the key, clearly overjoyed at the prospect of driving her very own automatic car.
    <br>And sure enough, she is off, driving down the road.
    <br>Her dream has become a reality.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
