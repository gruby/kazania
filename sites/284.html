    <br>Leave me alone.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Be free, in Jesus' name!

    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Madam, you are declared free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you so much. Thank you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank You so much!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Madam, we welcome you today here to the Anointing Revival in the UK.
    <br>We want to listen to your wonderful testimony that has been restored in your life.
    <br>Can you start by telling us your name and where you are from.
    <br>Hi, I'm Maggie Geddes. I'm from Southhampton (UK).
    <br>You are very welcome here today.
    <br>Can you tell us before you share your experience of what happened when you came,
    <br>what were the problems that you were experiencing in your life before your deliverance?
    <br>My problem started when I was a child.
    <br>I was abused mentally, physically, emotionally and sexually.
    <br>Throughout life, I grew up hating myself, the world and everybody.
    <br>I had anger and depression really badly because as I was abused,
    <br>I suffered from anger inside because I could not fight it.
    <br>It got deeper and deeper.
    <br>I then got depressed and started taking drugs.
    <br>I abused myself in every kind of way.
    <br>I started to try and kill myself a few times - suicide.
    <br>I have six children. I was very controlling.
    <br>I was very, very angry at my children.
    <br>I was really angry at myself but I took my anger out on them.
    <br>Apart from this depression that you mentioned
    <br>that brought about suicidal thoughts and this spirit of anger,
    <br>was there any other problem you were also experiencing
    <br>when you were moving alone, walking in parks?
    <br>What were the kind of problems you were experiencing?
    <br>I was absolutely petrified of the dark.
    <br>I would not leave my house in the dark.
    <br>I would not let my children go out in the dark.
    <br>I would never be alone in the dark.
    <br>I could not sleep at night in the dark; I had to have my television on all night.
    <br>I had to have sound. I could never be alone in the dark.
    <br>So you were extremely afraid of the dark and you were having a severe spirit of fear.
    <br>Can you tell us - this fear that you were experiencing, what did it push you to do?
    <br>It pushed me to try and kill myself, to be very angry,
    <br>hate everybody and really hate myself.
    <br>Apart from that side of your life, what about your physical health?
    <br>What were the experiences you were having?
    <br>I suffered from heart disease, lung disease, diabetes and all kinds of things.
    <br>Ok. So we can really hear the story of this sister,
    <br>how she was suffering from several different problems in her life.
    <br>She said, right from an early age, she had a severe fear of many different things in her life
    <br>which caused her depression, and this depression also caused her to have suicidal thoughts.
    <br>Because of that, she also started a drug abuse,
    <br>and she was just abusing herself both spirit, soul and body throughout her life
    <br>which also caused a lot of physical problems in her life.
    <br>So now we want to hear from you, as you came to the Anointing Water Revival,
    <br>you had all these problems that you were experiencing,
    <br>your children had been suffering from it, your family, relations.
    <br>Just explain to us - how did these problems now bring you to the Anointing Water Revival
    <br>in the UK, which was in London a couple of weeks ago?
    <br>And when you came there, the Anointing Water was administered to you.
    <br>Can you just explain to us - when you came there, what happened?
    <br>When I got there, I was quite surprised. I didn't know what I was expecting.
    <br>I came to the front for prayer and I didn't believe it.
    <br>I had doubts as to whether it was real or not.
    <br>I thought, "No, these people are all faking it!"
    <br>I did; I'm sorry. I thought everybody was faking it.
    <br>It came to my turn but I kept skipping it by swapping with other people.
    <br>Eventually an evangelist came to me and said,
    <br>"I annoint you with the Anointing Water" and I said, "Yeah".
    <br>As far as I was concerned, he sprayed me twice and I fell on the floor.
    <br>I woke up from the floor and somebody told me,
    <br>"Congratulations, you have been set free".
    <br>I said, "Thank you very much" but I had no idea what he was talking about.
    <br>I said, "Thank you, that's really great".
    <br>On my way home, as I had come with some people from Southamption from my church,
    <br>an elderly man said to me,
    <br>"You kind of reminded me of a silver-backed gorilla - really angry!"
    <br>I said, "Thanks, that's nice" but I still had no idea of what they were talking about.
    <br>Last Sunday, I went to church and a man from church said to me,
    <br>"I watched you on the internet".
    <br>I thought, "Oh, no!" He said, "You're on YouTube
    <br>and I thought, "This can't be true!"
    <br>He sent me the link and I went on YouTube and there I was.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>There I was for the whole world to see.
    <br>What I need to express to people is the way I feel -
    <br>overly joyous, happy, content and no fear of the dark.
    <br>Can we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>If you believe that Jesus Christ will work in your life today as well,
    <br>put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>So can you just explain now - after you received the deliverance
    <br>as you came to the Anointing Water Revival in the UK,
    <br>and you were administered upon with the Anointing Water,
    <br>how has your life been for the past few weeks?
    <br>It has been amazing, absolutely amazing!
    <br>I sleep like a baby; I have no fear of the dark.
    <br>I went through a park the other day at five o'clock in the evening with a little torch and nothing else.
    <br>I can't express how happy I am, how free I am.
    <br>I am now free!
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>There is no more anger, just joy and happiness.
    <br>I am content; I am actually content with my life.
    <br>Wow, glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>We thank God for this wonderful testimony that has been restored in your life.
    <br>And now, finally, there are many people out there,
    <br>they find themselves in depression, with suicidal thoughts,
    <br>many people find themselves very angry, fear, nightmares,
    <br>very similar challenges to the ones you were experiencing.
    <br>They too are looking for a solution.
    <br>Could you just give a word of advice to the people watching you right now?
    <br>Guys, you are here today. Come to the front.
    <br>Get that anointed prayer; it will change your life forever.
    <br>It changed mine, it can change all of you.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>And finally, we can see something in your hand.
    <br>That is the Anointing Water that was used,
    <br>that was the medium that God Almighty used to express Himself in your life.
    <br>Can you just tell us now - what is your word of advice about this Anointing Water?
    <br>This is the most amazing water you can ever get.
    <br>There will never be water like it.
    <br>You need to come to the front and be anointed with this Anointing Water.
    <br>Definitely.
    <br>Wow, glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>Can we once again put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Power in the name of Jesus. Amen.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ.
    <br>Once again, we also want to stress the fact,
    <br>as we have listened to this testimony now,
    <br>some people might be here, they are wondering what actually happened on the screen.
    <br>We want to stress the fact that what you saw on the screen of the television
    <br>when this lady was talking and saying different things,
    <br>and she was under the influence of the Holy Spirit, it was not her talking.
    <br>It was the evil spirit that was talking.
    <br>And you are seeing the evidence today.
    <br>Now she is standing here to the glory of God.
    <br>We can all see the difference in her face.
    <br>She is happy and we thank God that the best is yet to come for you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Maggie Geddes - Southampton, UK
    <br>We are still listening to more wonderful testimonies.
    <br>Before you go, we want to encourage you once again.
    <br>Make His Word the standard for your life
    <br>and make sure that the name of Jesus Christ is glorified in your life
    <br>so that all the wonderful testimonies you have, will continue to be maintained
    <br>and multiplied in your life more and more, from glory to glory, in Jesus' name.
    <br>By the power of the Lord. Amen.
