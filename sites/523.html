    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>My name is Victor Pascal.
    <br>I come from Cameroon.
    <br>I am originally from Benin, residing in Cameroon.
    <br>My prophecy first was about my passport.
    <br>The man of God told me that I should prepare my passport
    <br>because there is a journey before me.
    <br>He prophesied that I had an addiction and that I took something in dreams.
    <br>Where is your passport?
    <br>My passport is at home.
    <br>You should be ready for a jouney; you will be travelling.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>You are addicted to something.
    <br>Each time you stop it, you find yourself continue again.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You have stopped it but you continue.
    <br>You stop it, you continue.
    <br>The urge to take it keeps coming.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thirdly, there was no promotion twice.
    <br>Really that is 100 percent.
    <br>All those prophecies are 100 percent because I was addicted to alcohol.
    <br>I always went to herbalists.
    <br>In order to find out what was happening to me,
    <br>they gave me things to eat and I always ate them.
    <br>I was also addicted to herbal medicine and drinking alcohol.
    <br>I used to serve alcohol to idols so I had to drink alcohol before serving them.
    <br>I always drank alcohol to the extent that my wife was always complaining.
    <br>It affected me because I couldn't reason well to achieve better things.
    <br>At my age, I didn't have anything.
    <br>I went to school properly but I couldn't pay house rent
    <br>and school fees for my children.
    <br>I was promoted in the consulate of the Republic of Benin in Cameroon.
    <br>Many times, when the consulate said, "I will send your name to Cotonou"
    <br>or promised to do this or that, finally, nothing happened.
    <br>He told me to find an office which I did and paid for the office
    <br>but since September when I started working in the office, he has not come
    <br>or said anything - there was no promotion at all.
    <br>Now that you have received this prophecy in your life,
    <br>what do you believe God for?
    <br>Now, I give my life to Jesus; I know that way way is not to follow idols but Jesus.
    <br>I thank Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I believe the prophecy 100 percent -
    <br>the prophecy will deliver me and my family, especially my wife and children.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
