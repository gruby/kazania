    <br>The Bible says, whatever makes men good Christians makes them good citizens.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Whatever makes men good Christians makes them good citizens.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's quickly go to the proof text: Job 1:21-22.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there.
    <br>The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away;
    <br>blessed be the name of the LORD.'
    <br>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong."
    <br>Let's also look at Job 2:10.
    <br>"But he said to her, 'You speak as one of the foolish women speaks.
    <br>Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?'
    <br>In all this Job did not sin with his lips."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Discovering Your Purpose
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Discovering Your Purpose
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The purpose of life is to glorify God in both good and hard times alike.
    <br>Job knew this - that the purpose of life is to glorify God in both good and hard times alike.
    <br>When we do not know the purpose of life, our lives have no meaning
    <br>because God allows trials in our lives, not to impair us but to improve us.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>God allows trials in our lives, not to impair us but to improve us.
    <br>Job knew this.
    <br>I mean, God gives enough grace for each trial we face.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God gives enough grace for each trial we face".
    <br>What is your trial?
    <br>Your trial could be sickness, poverty, hardship, isolation;
    <br>your trial could be any of these foolish things.
    <br>Whatever is your trial today will prepare you for extraordinary service.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Whatever is my trial as a Christian will prepare me for extraordinary service!"
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Whatever is my trial as a Christian will prepare me for extraordinary service!]
    <br>You know when something is 'extraordinary',
    <br>that is, the way you were serving God before now will improve.
    <br>Your love will improve.
    <br>Your desire will improve.
    <br>Your determination will improve.
    <br>Whatever your trial is will prepare you, instead of taking you back,
    <br>causing you backward, overthrow you; but will prepare you.
    <br>Making you to lose your post - no - but to prepare you.
    <br>Job's trials prepared him for extraordinary service.
    <br>When you read, you see the trouble Job was facing actually prepared him for extraordinary service.
    <br>The Bible says he loved God more than ever before.
    <br>Satan's intention was to overthrow him.
    <br>Satan's intention was to cause Job pain,
    <br>to make Job begin to look at God in a bad light.
    <br>"God is not good now."
    <br>"If He is good, I am serving Him, I pay my tithe, I come to church regularly, I do everything;
    <br>all my friends smoke, drink, go to clubs but I am always with God.
    <br>Why should all this happen to me?"
    <br>Even his wife was reminding him, "Look, your friends are out there dancing; they are enjoying
    <br>but you are always in the house of God, in the presence of God. Why should all this happen to you?
    <br>Could this be the fruit of righteousness?"
    <br>This is exactly what satan was all about to make him forget about God
    <br>but instead, the trouble prepared Job for extraordinary service.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your trouble will prepare you for extraordinary service".
    <br>He never said anything wrong about God.
    <br>He said, "Whether He blesses me or not, He is my God.
    <br>Whether He heals me or not, He is my Healer.
    <br>Whether He saves me or not, He is my Saviour".
    <br>Whether you reject Him or not, that will not take Him from His throne, or change His name.
    <br>Whether He heals me or not, He is my Healer.
    <br>Whether He delivers me or not, He is my Deliverer.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The devil wants us to curse God while under pain.
    <br>He wants us to speak against God while under pain.
    <br>This is just what the devil wants.
    <br>He takes delight in afflicting people; he takes joy in it.
    <br>When one is not happy, he is happy that you are not happy.
    <br>But when you are happy, he is not happy that you are happy.
    <br>He takes delight in afflicting people with pain.
    <br>He wants you to curse God while under pain.
    <br>When you are happy, you can't curse God - he knows that.
    <br>God is whom He says He is; He does not change.
    <br>Whether there is money in your pocket or not, blessed be His name.
    <br>The Bible says that those who bless God in trouble prove their sonship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Those who bless God in trouble prove their sonship".
    <br>"Yes, I'm a born again" - that is when we know you are born again.
    <br>It is not words of mouth.
    <br>Those who bless Jesus in trouble, sickness -
    <br>while you are in sickness, you still say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>While you are poor, you say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>While everything looks unpleasant around you, you still say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Those who bless Jesus in trouble prove their sonship, prove that really they are born again.
    <br>When we know the purpose of our lives, our lives will have meaning.
    <br>No matter what comes - in good times, "Lord, blessed be Your name",
    <br>in hard times, "Lord, blessed be Your name".
    <br>That you are a Christian does not mean you cannot be sick or you cannot face trials.
    <br>But your trials as a Christian should prepare you for extraordinary service.
    <br>It makes you to fast the more, pray the more...
    <br>If you have been praying 3 times before, it will now increase to 6 times.
    <br>That is the purpose of life.
    <br>A man may be sick in body and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>Your situation, your trial should not mislead you,
    <br>should not dictate the direction of your prayer.
    <br>You can be sick and say, "Thank You, Jesus" in your prayer,
    <br>instead of "Heal me!", you say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>But today, when we are sick, sickness dictates the direction of our prayer.
    <br>Our situation dictates what to say in our prayer.
    <br>When we are well, we say, "Thank You" in our prayer.
    <br>When we are sick, we complain, lament in our prayer.
    <br>This is what satan wants.
    <br>He wants us at all times to be complaining and lamenting.
    <br>He does not want us to say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>He wants us to complain all the time.
    <br>For those who know the purpose of life, no matter what comes,
    <br>no matter what happens, "Lord, blessed be Your name".
    <br>In good times, "Blessed be Your name".
    <br>In hard times, "Blessed be Your name".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "For those who know the purpose of life, no matter what comes,
    <br>"Lord, blessed be Your name".
    <br>In good times, "Lord, blessed be Your name".
    <br>In hard times, "Lord, blessed be Your name".
    <br>That you are a Christian does not mean you cannot face trials.
    <br>God allows trials in our lives not to impair us but to improve us.
    <br>God gives enough grace for each trial we face.
    <br>The difference between we Christians and others:
    <br>we Christians, our trials prepare us for extraordinary service.
    <br>While others, their trials are meant to destroy them, to keep them away from God.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If anybody says we Christians don't face trials - no!
    <br>Trials could be sickness, hardship.
    <br>We Christians can face trials.
    <br>The difference between our situation and others':
    <br>our situation prepares us for extraordinary service.
    <br>Each situation makes us to pray the more, fast the more.
    <br>Each situation strengthens our desire and our determination for God.
    <br>That is the purpose of your situation.
    <br>It is not meant to draw you away
    <br>but it is meant to strengthen your desire and your determination for God.
    <br>To pray the more...
    <br>If not your situation, would you be here today?
    <br>Would you know T.B. Joshua today?
    <br>Would I know you today?
    <br>When you look at your pocket - there is money, table - there is food, health-wise - OK.
    <br>What would be your business here?
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Christians today - when they are sick, they will not tell people, till they die.
    <br>They die in silence.
    <br>They say, "If I say I'm sick, they will say, 'As a result of his sin' ".
    <br>That is why people are afraid to say they are sick.
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Why can't we act like Paul Apostle?
    <br>3 times he said, "Thorn in my flesh...".
    <br>God said, "My grace is sufficient for you".
    <br>An Apostle of God.
    <br>Because he knew that thorn was not as a result of sin.
    <br>Today, because of wrong doctrine everywhere, everybody is afraid to say, "I'm sick".
    <br>Pastor is afraid to say, "I'm sick".
    <br>"Maybe he went to do something."
    <br>No!
    <br>Our sickness is different from others'.
    <br>Our hardship is different from others'.
    <br>Our pain...
    <br>We can have pain but our pain is different from others'.
    <br>Others' are meant to kill them, to destroy them, to take them away from God.
    <br>But ours are to strengthen our desire,
    <br>to stop us awhile in order to prepare us for the journey ahead.
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>We can be sick; doctor can test you - you can have cancer
    <br>but as a Christian, your cancer is different from others'.
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Don't be afraid.
    <br>Your cancer is different from others'.
    <br>Others' - it is meant to kill, destroy them and take them away.
    <br>When they have cancer, they begin to say, "My God. I serve God so much. I worship."
    <br>This is a Christian with ideas.
    <br>They begin to complain, to see Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>But a real Christian - when you are sick, whatever name they call it - cancer or whatever -
    <br>it is not meant to destroy you.
    <br>Yours is meant to prepare you for extraordinary service.
    <br>Think about the case of Job.
    <br>Did the situation of Job destroy him?
    <br>Job shouted, cried out.
    <br>The situation of Job - was it as a result of unrighteousness?
    <br>[No!]
    <br>But he did not keep it to himself; he cried out.
    <br>Even when the wife was saying, "Look, as a result of unrighteousness, righteousness cannot bring this",
    <br>he said, "Look, my dear - a man that gave you salad,
    <br>if he now gives you bitter leaf, you should take it".
    <br>Somebody who has been giving you salad, and you have been eating and enjoying,
    <br>if bitter leaf comes, you should be able to say, "Oh...".
    <br>That is it.
    <br>This is the purpose of life.
    <br>The purpose of life is to glorify God in both good and hard times.
    <br>Good means, when the money is in the pocket.
    <br>Hard times means, when there is no money in the pocket.
    <br>Say, "Jesus, thank You!"
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>If your spirit is blessed, let me see your hand.
    <br>You know today that whatever situation you are in, what matters is, are you a Christian?
    <br>Don't let the situation mislead you.
    <br>This situation should not mislead you, telling you, "Am I a Christian?"
    <br>It is true - sin brings sickness.
    <br>It is true - sin brings hardship.
    <br>But I have clarified that there are two situations.
    <br>Our situation as Christians is different from the situation of others.
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Don't keep silent.
    <br>When you are facing a situation, confess the situation, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>We can be sick but our sickness is different from others'.
    <br>Our sickness, our situation, our trials are not meant to kill us,
    <br>are not meant to destroy us but for the glory of God.
    <br>They are meant to prepare us for extraordinary service.
    <br>Pray the more, fast the more!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Discovering your purpose".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>When you discover your purpose on earth as a Christian,
    <br>no matter what comes, "Lord, blessed be Your name".
    <br>In good times, "Lord, blessed be Your name",
    <br>in hard times alike, "Lord, blessed be Your name",
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Before now you kept murmuring, complaining, "I fast, I pray.
    <br>People looking at me keep seeing me 'up and down', with epileptic situation..."
    <br>No, take it easy.
    <br>Be happy and rejoice - that is the purpose of life as a Christian.
    <br>When we begin to look at ourselves as if we are not Christians, as if God is not faithful to us -
    <br>whereas we, we don't know the purpose of life.
    <br>Then, the situation begins to have upper hand.
    <br>I will pray with you today.
    <br>Every demonic medium; I call it medium - just think of it.
    <br>Every demonic medium holding your destiny...
    <br>Every demonic medium holding your destiny, be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It could be a certain dress you have at home ignorantly, maybe some time ago
    <br>somebody dashed you a dress, you don't know,
    <br>or you put your dress somewhere, somebody just cut it,
    <br>or somebody took it for 2-3-4 days to somewhere and returned it back,
    <br>but you would not know because your wardrobe is full.
    <br>It may be money that will be given; maybe somebody gave that money
    <br>and took it to ritual places and returned it back to you.
    <br>Once that money enters yours, they use that to take everything you have.
    <br>Every demonic medium
    <br>holding your destiny...
    <br>Or there is a pronouncement over you.
    <br>Every demonic pronouncement over your life, business...
    <br>Don't begin to compare yourself and say,
    <br>"I'm a Christian. Why should I have the same problem as this man?
    <br>This man is smoking, drinking.
    <br>All this can cause nonsense to his life, but I don't smoke or drink, I'm just for God.
    <br>Why should I have this? Where does this thing come from?"
    <br>Please, don't compare.
    <br>A Christian should not compare himself to others because you are specially made.
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Nothing can separate me...
    <br>Sickness cannot separate me from the love of God."
    <br>What do you understand if someone is saying, "Nothing can separate me"?
    <br>That shows that he can have those things but those things are not meant to destroy him,
    <br>those things are only threatening.
    <br>Those things can threaten your life but cannot do you any harm.
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Nothing can separate me from the love of God.
    <br>Can sickness?
    <br>Can affliction?
    <br>Can poverty?
    <br>What can separate me from the love of God?
    <br>Those things can threaten us but they cannot do more than that.
    <br>Yes, be free; many are in a bondage.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>DISCOVERING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE: T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Thank you!
