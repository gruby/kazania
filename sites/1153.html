  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever you are using to view us,
    <br>ask the evil spirit to leave your life, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my life!
    <br>You evil spirit, leave my life!
    <br>Open your lips - ask the evil spirit to leave your life, to leave your career.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>That spirit of nightmare, limitation, stagnation, affliction, leave my life!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever that disease, affliction - leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you, you affliction, leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>When Jesus says, "Out! You affliction, out! You sickness, out!", who can say, "No"?
    <br>I say to you affliction, in the name of Jesus, out!
    <br>In my blood - out! In my bones - out! In my kidneys - out! In my liver - out!
    <br>Wherever it is located, in the name of Jesus, you affliction,
    <br>wherever it is located in my bones, blood, liver, kidneys, organ - out, in the name of Jesus!
