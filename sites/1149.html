  <p>    
    <br>There is a brother there that the wife is planning to leave him now.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Why does your wife want to leave you?
    <br>She is there.
    <br>Why do you want to leave your husband?
    <br>I'm no more feeling okay.
    <br>You don't have feelings.
    <br>Come here. 
    <br>It is not that you don't have feelings.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>She told you that she wants to leave you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Already for the past months, she 
    <br>has not been sleeping with you.
    <br>Yes, sir. I don't sleep with him any longer.
    <br>You don't sleep with him?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You sleep in your room separately.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She has removed the ring.
    <br>You have removed the ring?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>After the deliverance, she will now see the potential in you.
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Don't worry, she will see the good in you.
    <br>The good in you - she could not 
    <br>see it again because she was possessed.
    <br>Come on. See this man.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus!
    <br>Clap for Jesus once again!
    <br>Remember, Jesus has come to restore relationship.
    <br>Jesus has come to put an end to the past and give birth to the future.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, as you are watching, remember,
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>And as the man of God says:
    <br>In a Christian home, misunderstanding leads to greater understanding.
    <br>So whatever challenges you are facing, listen to this testimony.
    <br>You will know that there is a way where there seems to be no way.
    <br>The way is Jesus Christ!
    <br>Give thanks to Him once again.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We are seeing you joyful because the Lord has done something in your life.
    <br>Hallelujah. Can you please introduce yourselves to our viewers
    <br>and tell us the testimony, what Jesus 
    <br>has done in your life,
    <br>in your marital life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I'm so glad this morning.
    <br>My name is Mrs Esabella Samtu from Togo.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>What brought us to The SCOAN was a marital problem.
    <br>Last week, the man of God prophesied,
    <br>telling us that there was a man over there whose wife wanted to divorce him.
    <br>He said that I took off my ring and that I had not slept with him for a long time.
    <br>He also said I moved into my room.
    <br>I confirm today that the prophecy is hundred percent true.
    <br>He prayed with us and cast away the spirit.
    <br>It is almost six years that I have been married to my husband.
    <br>He did everything a man can do for a woman to be happy, yet I had no affection for him.
    <br>I heard that when I wanted to divorce him, he went and took some drugs to kill himself.
    <br>We got scared of the whole thing and rushed to God.
    <br>God has opened His hands to us and put a smile on our faces.
    <br>We are so happy.
    <br>Mrs Esabella Samtu & Husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Anytime he slept with me, I didn't like it; I didn't feel him.
    <br>There was a time he came to my office and I introduced him as my brother.
    <br>I was not proud of him as a man besides me.
    <br>I even planned to go to another man, and I had packed my things.
    <br>I had hoped that when we came to The SCOAN,
    <br>the man of God would say that he was not good for me.
    <br>Then, I would go and take my things out.
    <br>He was praying that God should restore his marriage because God had me for him.
    <br>He was eager to do everything a man could do to keep his marriage.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You said you had taken off the wedding rings. Tell us much more about that.
    <br>For about six months, I was not wearing the wedding rings.
    <br>I kept them somewhere else.
    <br>But that day - last week Sunday - I just asked for it when the spirit was out of me.
    <br>I went for it myself and wore it.
    <br>I realised that this man is good for me.
    <br>He has so much potential in him.
    <br>Clap for Jesus!
    <br>Madam, tell us what are the changes you observed in your relationship
    <br>with your husband since that deliverance.
    <br>Oh, so good ones.
    <br>When we met as husband and wife, I realised there was a change;
    <br>I liked it so much.
    <br>Mrs Esabella Samtu & Husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Before, I didn't like holding him while we were walking but right now, I can hold him.
    <br>I can kiss him and do everything with him.
    <br>I'm proud to have him as my husband.
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus! Clap for Jesus!
    <br>Let someone say, "A new love has come.
    <br>A new understanding has come".
    <br>Who can justly do it?
    <br>- Jesus Christ, the Restorer.
    <br>Clap for Him once again.
    <br>Madam, there are many couples that are watching you right now all over the world,
    <br>who are going through the tough situation you went through.
    <br>What is your advice to them?
    <br>I would like to tell the whole world,
    <br>especially couples who are in the same situation as we were before,
    <br>not to take decisions on their own.
    <br>They should seek the face of God.
    <br>God is capable of solving the problem and put a smile on their face.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sir, we are seeing you smiling. Tell us what God has done for you.
    <br>We want to hear from you your experience.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I give thanks to God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua, who allowed us to have joy today.
    <br>We came to the arena of liberty because we were having marital problems.
    <br>Some months ago, my wife decided to leave me.
    <br>There were different reasons for that decision.
    <br>First of all, she said she would leave me because she needed to have children.
    <br>She would say she had no feelings for me and that she felt oppressed; so, I should let her go.
    <br>I was confused and did not know who to confide in or where to find solution to the problem.
    <br>He is thanking God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua, for what God has done in his life.
    <br>The problem that brought him was a marital problem.
    <br>For a long time, there was no affection
    <br>and his wife told him that she wanted to leave him for many reasons.
    <br>First, they have no child and second, no affection in the relationship.
    <br>So, I was praying and I also consulted my two pastor friends who advised me.
    <br>He told me that he knew one place, the arena of liberty where I would find solution.
    <br>So, I decided to come to the arena of liberty.
    <br>Before we came, my wife had already removed her wedding ring but I brought it with me.
    <br>On Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied that there was a man whose wife wanted to leave him.
    <br>Immediately we came forward, the man of God prayed for us and we were delivered.
    <br>I want to ask you a question.
    <br>He said that when the problem became so tough,
    <br>they decided to come to the arena of liberty to seek the face of God.
    <br>The wife had removed the ring already,
    <br>meaning she had already taken the decision to leave him.
    <br>So when they came here to the church of God, the man of God gave a word of prophecy,
    <br>fetched them out and exposed the root cause of their problem.
    <br>After the word of prophecy, they were delivered and restored.
    <br>I want to ask you one question.
    <br>When your wife removed the ring, what came to your mind?
    <br>I came seeking God at the arena of liberty and I found solution. I confirm that God is here.
    <br>He said he was so confused - how can God unsettle a marriage
    <br>where the wife is praying for separation, and the husband is praying for restoration.
    <br>So they decided to come to the arena of liberty to seek the truth - the face of God.
    <br>He wants to tell everybody that God is alive and God is real.
    <br>Mrs Esabella Samtu & Husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>After the deliverance, I feel happy and sleep like a new-born baby.
    <br>He says he is very happy and sleeps like
    <br>a baby.
    <br>God has restored their marriage and they are happy and give thanks to God
    <br>for the mighty works He has done through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Many married men are having trouble.
    <br>Please, what is your advice to those watching you?
    <br>To every man in that same situation,
    <br>I advise them to be patient, pray and seek the face of God.
    <br>Only God has the solution to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>He says that it is only God who has the answer to all your troubles.
    <br>Please don't listen to advice of people around you.
    <br>Don't take your own decision; come and seek the face of God.
    <br>When God comes, solution comes, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus once again.
    <br>Madam, we want to hear your advice to all the people watching all over the world.
    <br>To the women, the wives that are having trouble in their marital life -
    <br>what is your advice to them?
    <br>I would like to tell all couples to always seek the face of God
    <br>before taking any kind of decision, no matter the situation.
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's clap for Him.
    <br>Mrs Esabella Samtu & Husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
