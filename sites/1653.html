  <p>    
    <br>There's a brother there.
    <br>Your friend died and he had a huge amount of money in your possession.
    <br>It is only you and your friend that know about this.
    <br>If you're just silent about that money - remember what you are seeing.
    <br>Every time you see death, death.
    <br>It's your friend that is tormenting you.
    <br>I think Jesus is calling you. Come out.
    <br>If you cannot pay the money back, you pay half of the money to the family.
    <br>So, please come out. Jesus loves you.
    <br>HIS BEST FRIEND LOANED HIM MONEY... AND THEN HE DIED!!! ðŸ˜±
    <br>Come.
    <br>Help me, Man of God!
    <br>That is why I called you because you keep seeing a dead body.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You have to return the money.
    <br>If you don't return the money, you will join this dead body too.
    <br>You will be delivered.
    <br>After deliverance, I am ready to help you pay half, you pay half.
    <br>THE NEXT SERVICE DAY
    <br>My name is Clarence Julius. 
    <br>I'm from Rivers State, Nigeria.
    <br>I'm a businessman.
    <br>I am the one the man of God was prophesying about.
    <br>Last Sunday was my first time here
    <br>and during the mass prayer, the man of God prophesied that
    <br>there was a brother here whose late friend left some money with him
    <br>and it was only the brother and his late friend that were aware of the money
    <br>and he was not able to pay the money before the death of his friend.
    <br>I am here to confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>It all started in the year 2004 when I had three companies.
    <br>I am into automobile business, I process baking flour, and I plant crops for export.
    <br>Then in 2004, my business suffered some financial challenges.
    <br>I talked to my late friend and he said that the only money he had was
    <br>the money he wanted to use to build a house for his younger sister.
    <br>He later gave me the money which was 1.8 million naira.
    <br>Shortly after that, he got sick and was diagnosed with kidney failure.
    <br>The younger sister and I had been taking him from one hospital to the other but to no avail.
    <br>Then one morning, when we were in the hospital with him,
    <br>he asked the younger sister to go and buy him water.
    <br>As soon as the sister left, he called me, held my hand and said,
    <br>"In case I die..."
    <br>HIS BEST FRIEND LOANED HIM MONEY... AND THEN HE DIED!!! ðŸ˜±
    <br>He held my hand and said, "In case I die, please, take care of my sister."
    <br>He also reminded me of the money which was meant for her accommodation,
    <br>and said that I should pay back the money to her.
    <br>Shortly after that, the sister came in and he vomited blood and passed on.
    <br>Since then, it has not been easy.
    <br>I wouldn't say that I have done enough to take care of the woman.
    <br>In the year 2006, the family gathered and shared the man's property and drove the woman away.
    <br>HIS BEST FRIEND LOANED HIM MONEY... AND THEN HE DIED!!! ðŸ˜±
    <br>Then, I did not have the money to give to the woman
    <br>but I paid her rent for three years; then, the rent expired by 2009.
    <br>In 2010, I have not been able to pay the landlord yet
    <br>and the man has given her a quit notice.
    <br>Now, the woman is crying and suffering.
    <br>So three months ago, I started seeing my late friend in the dream telling me to pay back the money.
    <br>It has not been easy.
    <br>He said that I should pay the money to her and she is really suffering.
    <br>I keep seeing him in my dream.
    <br>I see dead people in my dream.
    <br>They give me food to eat. 
    <br>In fact, I am restless.
    <br>I move from one room to the other; I move from one room to the other in my house every night,
    <br>yet no peace.
    <br>The worst now is that for some days, I have not slept.
    <br>It's like, I have a crown on my head and
    <br>I decided to come to The Synagogue to see the man of God.
    <br>When I came, God located me and the man of God prophesied about my case.
    <br>I cannot sleep; I have taken pills to induce myself to sleep.
    <br>However, instead of sleeping, it makes me weak; I cannot reason well.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me.
    <br>My friend is tormenting me.
    <br>They are driving me to my grave.
    <br>Please, help me.
    <br>OK. The first thing is that he has to sleep.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>HIS BEST FRIEND LOANED HIM MONEY... AND THEN HE DIED!!! ðŸ˜±
    <br>This is deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The sleeping he couldn't do, he will just continue to sleep from here.
    <br>Now now now he has to sleep.
    <br>HIS BEST FRIEND LOANED HIM MONEY... AND THEN HE DIED!!! ðŸ˜±
    <br>I personally want to see the sister of the late brother.
    <br>HIS BEST FRIEND LOANED HIM MONEY... AND THEN HE DIED!!! ðŸ˜±
    <br>It's better for him to owe me money than to owe a dead body money.
    <br>We must pay restitution.
    <br>If we don't pay this restitution, there will be no deliverance.
    <br>It goes with it.
    <br>Here is Mr. Clarence Julius, fast asleep on the floor just as Prophet T.B. Joshua had declared would happen.
    <br>He is being taken to rest in a private room until the Spirit of God wakes him from his slumber.
    <br>HIS BEST FRIEND LOANED HIM MONEY... AND THEN HE DIED!!! ðŸ˜±
    <br>Mr. Julius is now relaxing in the precious arms of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>This is a totally different case from his complaints of restlessness before the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
