  <p>    
    <br>I'm Bishop Joseph Garlington.
    <br>I'm the pastor of Covenant Church of Pittsburgh, USA.
    <br>The thing that God is doing in your midst is beyond our comprehension,
    <br>and many times, when God begins to do something,
    <br>we don't have a real understanding of what He is beginning to do.
    <br>What God is doing in this place - there is something that is going out from this place
    <br>that's going to turn the world upside down.
    <br>And so many times people come to America thinking that they're going to see the great power of God,
    <br>but I want you to know what we're seeing here, we don't see in America.
    <br>THROWBACK: International Pastors Share Experiences At The SCOAN!!!
    <br>I'm Pastor John Arnott from Toronto, Canada.
    <br>We are just thrilled to be here.
    <br>We are just amazed and worshipping and thanking God
    <br>for all that we are seeing Him doing in your midst here in Nigeria.
    <br>In Canada we need healing miracles.
    <br>We have three or four people in our church who come every week in wheelchairs.
    <br>We have prayed for them many times. They have not gone out of those chairs.
    <br>That's why we are back in Nigeria.
    <br>We are saying, "Oh God, Oh God. We have to have the power of the Holy Spirit."
    <br>Yesterday, it was our privilege to meet with your pastor, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He is a man of God.
    <br>There are many millions of Christians in the world.
    <br>I don't know anywhere where you can go to see so many healings, like you have here.
    <br>I don't know anywhere.
    <br>My wife and I have visited maybe 40 nations.
    <br>We have been to Egypt, South Africa, Japan, Indonesia, Korea,
    <br>Europe in many places: Germany and England...
    <br>I have never seen the healing power of God such as you have here among you.
    <br>I just want to tell you that I've been to Hawaii, North America, South America, Canada,
    <br>I've been to all over Europe, I've been to many countries in Africa,
    <br>but I've never ever seen the power of God manifest like it's here.
    <br>There are people outside there; they've got HIV. They are dying.
    <br>They've got cancer. They are dying.
    <br>All over the world they are dying without Jesus,
    <br>and we've got it here, you've got it here!!!
    <br>I'm a director of River Ministries.
    <br>I've been in the ministry now for twenty-four years.
    <br>And I've prayed and I said, "God, I'm looking for the anointing. It must be somewhere."
    <br>And about five years ago God spoke to me clearly.
    <br>He said to me, "Go into the world and look and you will find a man of God.
    <br>And you will find what I want to give you from him."
    <br>So, I've travelled and I believe today, from the depth of my heart, and I'm honest with you;
    <br>I believe that this is the place that God wants to meet with me.
