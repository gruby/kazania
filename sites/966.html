  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua sent the New Morning Water to be ministered by his evangelists
    <br>to the congregation in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>As the ministration began, miracles, signs and wonders broke out among the people
    <br>as God's mighty power touched them - spirit, soul and body.
    <br>Watch as this man receives the New Morning Water and comes under the delivering influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Suddenly, he begins to cough and vomit out poisonous substances,
    <br>and the spiritual cause of his problem is uprooted as he vomits out several needles.
    <br>Take note, these are no ordinary needles the man is vomiting out but it is part of his deliverance
    <br>from the hands of darkness, which has been using him as an agent of destruction.
    <br>Here you can clearly see some of the needles the man vomited out on the floor
    <br>after the ministration of the New Morning Water in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let us hear the confession of the evil spirit
    <br>and how it had used these spiritual needles, and how it had affected this man's life.
    <br>To God be the Glory. As you can watch on the television screen,
    <br>needles are coming out of the system of a human being upon the ministration of the New Morning Water.
    <br>So right now we want to hear from the brother - how come these pins and needles ended up in his system.
    <br>I'm a python.
    <br>Okay, what are these pins for?
    <br>They are very dangerous for the human body.
    <br>Ministration Of The New Morning Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>Who are you? Speak out!
    <br>Who are you? What have you done to this body? Who are you evil spirit? Who are you?
    <br>They are very dangerous for the human body.
    <br>How are they dangerous?
    <br>When I meet a woman without a condom ---
    <br>So what do you do with that woman when you meet her? What happens to her?
    <br>They begin to destroy so many things internally.
    <br>What have you destroyed? How many people have you destroyed?
    <br>They are many.
    <br>And how did you destroy this man? How did you destroy him?
    <br>These needles will turn into maggots inside their stomachs.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>They will turn into maggots inside the stomach.
    <br>And how did these pins enter his body? How did they enter the body? What are these pins are for?
    <br>Needles Vomited After Ministration Of The New Morning Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>They are for destruction.
    <br>For destruction, and how do you use these pins to destroy?
    <br>If I meet a woman without a condom, they will turn into maggots inside her stomach and start eating.
    <br>How many women have you destroyed with these needles?
    <br>How many women?
    <br>I cannot know. I can't count.
    <br>Uncountable. Alright.
    <br>Lord Jesus Christ, this is your power, this is your glory.
    <br>This is your power, this is your glory, in the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus, come out of this body! Out!
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now free in Jesus name, through the medium of the New Morning Water
    <br>sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Needles Vomited After Ministration Of The New Morning Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>Rise up, brother, you're free!
    <br>Set Free through The Ministration Of The New Morning Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>Okay, brother, how are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>OK, can you look on the floor?
    <br>Can you look on the floor? What do you see on the floor? Here? What do you see?
    <br>Set Free through The Ministration Of The New Morning Water In Jesus' Name
    <br>What do you see here on the floor?
    <br>They are pins.
    <br>These are needles. Where do these needles come from?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>But they came from your body!
    <br>How come?
    <br>Mr. Victor Awuzie, who had vomited the needles during the ministration of the New Morning Water,
    <br>met Prophet T.B. Joshua after the service and received his final deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>This was the moment when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for Mr. Victor in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Instantly the evil spirit reacts under the delivering power of God.
    <br>The evil spirit makes Mr.Victor flail about and tug at his shirt and vest,
    <br>desperately trying to resist and escape the fire of God's presence.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>As the deliverance continued, Mr. Victor began urinating
    <br>as the Lord Jesus Christ purged his body of any evil thing satan had planted in his life
    <br>and the poisonous substances kept pouring out,
    <br>until finally he was free completely in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Urinating Poisonous Substances
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr Victor Uche Awuzie.
    <br>I come from Imo state. I'm based in Abuja.
    <br>This is my wife, and these are my children.
    <br>I was initiated when I was very young, looking for power to have money.
    <br>Friends took me somewhere to do something to get money.
    <br>They confused me. They didn't tell me the after-effects.
    <br>We went to see a native doctor from India who told us to buy a white cock without blemish.
    <br>We saved money to bring it. After buying the cock, they took us to a deep forest.
    <br>When we got there, we saw a big tree with leaves.
    <br>He did some incantations and hit the cock at the center of the tree and the tree opened.
    <br>We entered inside the tree and then it closed.
    <br>It was a great surprise; it looked like another big world.
    <br>I saw a big python and different kind of snakes.
    <br>One of them rushed to me and curled itself around my body, from my leg to my head.
    <br>It brought its mouth in front of mine.
    <br>I was fed from mouth to mouth by the python.
    <br>What I was seeing was not the same as what my friends were seeing.
    <br>We spent seven days there.
    <br>After seven days, the man came back and did another incantation.
    <br>The tree opened and we came out.
    <br>Ok, so during the seven days you were inside this tree.
    <br>What were the things that were inserted into your body?
    <br>During the seven days we were inside, it was feeding me from mouth to mouth.
    <br>It was putting certain things like needles in my mouth.
    <br>The needles were four.
    <br>I realized there were four needles as each time one of them entered my stomach, I would feel it.
    <br>I felt it four times - that was how I knew that they were four needles.
    <br>These needles represented the powers that were being given to you by satan through this initiation.
    <br>Yes, the needles were the powers given to me to destroy women.
    <br>When I came out, I became an agent to destroy women, both single and married.
    <br>There was power in my eyes.
    <br>Whenever I looked at any woman, she would fall for me until I finished my mission.
    <br>My mission was that when I had sex with any woman,
    <br>immediately I released inside the woman,
    <br>one needle would go inside and turn into maggots.
    <br>It would destroy the woman through fibroids, barrenness, vaginal discharges and other things.
    <br>Just give us an example sir, for example,
    <br>a married woman that you were able to trap and sleep with,
    <br>what would then happen to their marriage after you met them?
    <br>We would cause confusion in her marriage through barrenness.
    <br>Any woman who cannot have children would not be happy.
    <br>The family would not be in unity; it would lead to separation or a big problem in the family.
    <br>Explain to us, sir, how would you go about meeting these women?
    <br>Where would you find them and what tricks would you use to entice and seduce them?
    <br>I used my eyes - whenever I focused on any woman, she would fall for me.
    <br>Or, in the night bus, any woman who sat behind me would fall for me that night.
    <br>If she was a married woman, she would call her husband to tell him,
    <br>"Our vehicle broke down on the way; I cannot make it.
    <br>They said they will bring another bus tomorrow".
    <br>I would keep her until I finished my mission.
    <br>If there was a rich man moving around, if I picked him up and he had anything with him,
    <br>mark that date - he would go down; his business and family would go down.
    <br>Can you give us an idea of how many women you have actually initiated through these means?
    <br>May God forgive me. It was uncountable.
    <br>Okay, we're listening to the confession of our brother.
    <br>He's explaining how he was initiated at a very young age,
    <br>in a quest for power to get money.
    <br>The assignment he was given from this demonic kingdom was to destroy women.
    <br>Especially married women. To destroy marriages and any woman that he would meet and sleep with,
    <br>the needles that were inside his body as given by that python,
    <br>that demonic python would actually enter the woman's body as maggots and cause sickness,
    <br>cause fibroid, barrenness, vaginal discharge and other ailments
    <br>that would eventually cause the end of the marriage or that person would be barren perpetually.
    <br>Our brother said that this spirit has pushed him to do this to literally countless numbers of women.
    <br>Could you just tell us, while all that was happening to you, you mentioned earlier that you were married?
    <br>How did you manage to meet your wife and marry and have children in the midst of this?
    <br>We had a covenant that they would not kill my wife.
    <br>The only thing was that my wife would suffer and deliver all her children through operation.
    <br>That was how it was.
    <br>So you mean to say that the three children your wife had,
    <br>all of them were delivered through operations and she suffered for it.
    <br>So once again, we're hearing the confession of our brother here.
    <br>Brother, you mentioned earlier that when you were lured into this cult that you were initiated in,
    <br>you never realized the repercussions, the negative consequences that would later happen
    <br>as you were being used by satan to destroy women.
    <br>What began to happen to your life?
    <br>The negative effects that you began to see in your own life in the midst of this?
    <br>I lived a very miserable life. They really tormented me - there was no peace in my life.
    <br>There was no peace at all.
    <br>I'm an artist. I'm a singer.
    <br>As I destroyed other people, they also destroyed me.
    <br>All my equipment, which I bought for over 800,000 naira -
    <br>they broke into my shop and packed all of it.
    <br>I don't have anything to say; I only ask God to forgive and restore me.
    <br>I'm a gospel artist.
    <br>You said that in the midst of this, as satan used you to destroy,
    <br>your own life was being destroyed, you went into gospel music,
    <br>started singing gospel music. What happened to your career in the area of gospel music?
    <br>I made an album but there was no way to move.
    <br>We can understand exactly what our brother is saying.
    <br>Everything satan promised to give him through this initiation,
    <br>at the end of the day it was stolen and taken from him, leaving him even worse than before.
    <br>Brother, there's an area we just want to ask you,
    <br>you mentioned that you had power in your eyes to seduce women -
    <br>once you fixed your eyes, they would fall for you.
    <br>Could you explain, was this every single woman you met or were there ---
    <br>Have you had some encounters in the past where you tried to seduce a woman and you were unable to
    <br>and what happened in that circumstance?
    <br>There are real women of God and real children of God.
    <br>We used to experience this.
    <br>When we would meet people like Prophet T.B. Joshua of The SCOAN,
    <br>people under him could never fall like that.
    <br>We want you to explain why this is so?  What is the reason for that?
    <br>Because you know, we have many gods, pastors and prophets but there is 'the last bus stop'.
    <br>This is the last bus stop.
    <br>We have Adjawadi. We have Adjawadi last bus stop.
    <br>When a vehicle takes you to Adjawadi, it must get to the last bus stop.
    <br>When it gets to the last stop, it is to turn back.
    <br>So this is the last bus stop.
    <br>As far as I'm concerned, it is the last bus stop.
    <br>I had been to many places but was never delivered until last Sunday when I came here.
    <br>If somebody had told me that something like this would happen, I would not have come here;
    <br>I would never step my feet here.
    <br>But I thank God for that was how God wanted it to be.
    <br>Upon whatever happened, I thank God. Glory be to God!
    <br>Tell us your experience of last week, sir.
    <br>What happened as the New Morning Water was ministered to you in the congregation?
    <br>Last week, I came to the service. I was downstairs at the back with my helper and some other men.
    <br>When they started ministering the New Morning Water, I was in a haste - I wanted to go,
    <br>I told the lady that I wanted to go.
    <br>An elderly man told me to be patient but I insisted that I wanted to go out and I didn't want to stay.
    <br>I didn't know that something was about to happen.
    <br>When they got to that place, it was the first time I ever flew up and fell down.
    <br>I didn't even know where I was.
    <br>When I stood up, I was very surprised to see myself sitting down.
    <br>I looked around, looking at people and I was confused - I didn't know what was going on.
    <br>I started vomiting needles - four big needles.
    <br>These were not pins, these were needles - four big needles.
    <br>I had been suffering from them for a long time.
    <br>All parts of my body - my stomach, my private part, chest and head - were painful.
    <br>I had been to many hospitals but there was no solution.
    <br>We saw that immediately after this encounter after the service,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua then prayed for you, and again that spirit burst out of you.
    <br>Can you explain what happened when the Prophet prayed for you after the service?
    <br>From here, I thought it was over.
    <br>Later on, in the evening,  when Prophet T.B. Joshua came out, he looked at me
    <br>and I said within me, "Another one".
    <br>He just waved his hand like this and I wanted to run away.
    <br>When I looked at my back, I couldn't run.
    <br>He just looked at me and said, "Something is still inside this stomach", and tapped me with power.
    <br>That was how I fell, started vomiting and passing urine.
    <br>After urinating, I drank nine bottles of water.
    <br>The following day, I drank eight bottles of water.
    <br>On the third day, I took seven bottles of water.
    <br>So, what you were trying to say is that,
    <br>immediately after the deliverance, all of those evil powers were leaving your body.
    <br>Now tell us, sir, ever since this encounter with Jesus last week,
    <br>through the New Morning Water and the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What are the changes you've seen in your life, as you're here right now.
    <br>I don't know why I am sitting down. I am very healthy within me - I can even carry my wife up.
    <br>I'm not supposed to sit down because I am fit.
    <br>I am very healthy - I have not felt pain anymore.
    <br>From head to toe, I am okay.
    <br>You mean you're no longer having encounters with that kingdom?
    <br>There are no bad dreams again. I'm okay.
    <br>Amen! People of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, it is only the power of God that could deliver our brother in such an incredible way.
    <br>Finally, what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world in light of your experiences in life?
    <br>My brother, young ones, ladies and boys, married men and women,
    <br>if anybody says they want to take you somewhere,
    <br>try to find out the implications because they will not tell you.
    <br>I want to advise the married ones.
    <br>Whether you offend your wife or your wife offends you, make sure you make peace.
    <br>Because leaving her with that anger and going out was how we manipulated women.
    <br>When your wife is not happy with you, it is very easy.
    <br>Whether your wife offended you or you offended your wife,
    <br>say, "Honey, I am sorry. Please forget what was going on", so that her anger will calm down.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We listened to that word of advice from our brother.
    <br>He's really speaking from experience, from the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>This really confirms Prophet T.B. Joshua's sermons,
    <br>concerning the need for us to let go off offence
    <br>because that truly is an instrument that the devil is using to cause separation,
    <br>to cause chaos, to cause problems. Especially in the house and the homes.
    <br>We thank God Almighty. Let's just hear one quick word from your wife to round off this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Maria Awuzie.
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I have four children; they are all here.
    <br>All he said - I agree with it because when we got married, there was no peace.
    <br>But before then, I saw him like any other person who wanted to marry a woman
    <br>and I agreed to get married to him.
    <br>After that, we went for court marriage.
    <br>After that, he broke the wedding ring and threw it away.
    <br>After that, when we slept, I noticed that his legs were chilled like ice cubes.
    <br>At around 12 - 3 am, I would touch his legs in a way he would not know and begin to pray,
    <br>interceding for him, asking God if it was a sin, may God forgive him.
    <br>From all his character, deeds, offence towards others and doing so many evil things,
    <br>I reached the conclusion that he was into evil and he might serve an Idol.
    <br>So, that's when your eyes opened, to realize that your husband was under the influence of these evil spirits.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now to the glory of God, last week he was delivered.
    <br>Can you just tell us, ever since his deliverance, what are the changes you've seen in his life?
    <br>What I have seen after his deliverance is that he is always happy with me,
    <br>he does not nag anymore and he does not shout at us anymore.
    <br>Before, just as you saw him roaring on television,
    <br>that was how he would roar at us at home and even in public places.
    <br>But now, he is no more like that.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, that is the evidence of deliverance that the evil spirit has left the life of her husband
    <br>and that's how peace and love have been restored to this home, and we give all the glory to God!
    <br>Finally, madam, what is your own word of advice?
    <br>My own word of advice is especially to women who want to marry.
    <br>I am advising you all not to marry any man you just meet on the street or anywhere,
    <br>or even at the man's parents home, without inquiring from God Almighty
    <br>because it's only God who can give you the best husband.
    <br>To men, I advise you before you give your attention to anyone,
    <br>you have to inquire from God.
    <br>When Ahithophel was against David, David inquired from God and God fought for David.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God for the deliverance in the life of this family.
    <br>We know that as they go forth now and make the Word of God the standard for their lives,
    <br>definitely the best is yet to come.
    <br>As satan used our brother in the past to kill and destroy in so many ways,
    <br>we believe his testimony and confession will bring life and deliverance to many people in the same way
    <br>and we give glory to God that he's freed from his past. His past is over and the best is yet to come.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Victor Uche Awuzie, I am from Imo state.
    <br>The people beside me are my family - my wife and my children.
    <br>I really thank God for changing my life and delivering me from my bondage
    <br>because I was in bondage.
    <br>I thank God for delivering me. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Since God delivered me, there are many changes.
    <br>Formerly, I was not a human being at all.
    <br>Physically, I was a human being but spiritually, I was not a human being.
    <br>Since He delivered me, I can call myself a human being by doing something that people like.
    <br>Since that day, I am seeing changes in my life.
    <br>To God be the glory! We thank Jesus Christ for this incredible deliverance.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>they're going to support you with the sum of 200,000 naira to start your new life in Christ Jesus,
    <br>to support your family and to support your career as well.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I really thank you.
    <br>Through the Almighty God, this money will enable me to forward my career as a Gospel Artist.
    <br>I know what to do with this money.
    <br>The Almighty God who provided this money through Pastor T.B. Joshua will give me the wisdom
    <br>to utilize this money, so that in a short time, I will come back and give another testimony,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>To God be the glory. We thank Jesus Christ for your life!
    <br>Better is not good enough, the best is yet to come for you and your family, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Thank You. Emmanuel! Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
