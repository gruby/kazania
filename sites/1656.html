    <br>Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke - a missionary with a burning passion for the Gospel,
    <br>a vision for Africa and the message for the world
    <br>crossed over to glory on December 7th 2019.
    <br>In 60 years of ministry, the founder of Christ For All Nations
    <br>had the joy of witnessing over 79 million people give their lives to Jesus Christ.
    <br>Somebody is watching you this very moment; His name is Jesus.
    <br>He continued to preach the Gospel even to his final moment,
    <br>often reminding people that salvation is only found in Jesus and Jesus must be preached.
    <br>The character of a true believer is that he finds refuge in the secret place of the Most High God.
    <br>Heaven is our resting place, our dwelling place.
    <br>Here Reinhard Bonnke rests - in the precious arms of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Emmanuel TV and The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations join believers around the world
    <br>to pray for God's strength and comfort upon the family of this dear servant of God
    <br>as we celebrate his life and legacy of harvest,
    <br>in the words of Reinhard Bonnke:
    <br>"I don't want a monument. We don't build monuments; we build God's kingdom."
