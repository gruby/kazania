  <p>    
    <br>There is a brother there, you have a new woman.
    <br>You love your woman - a very kind woman -
    <br>but mistakenly, you found yourself getting married to somebody outside
    <br>and you have rented a secret place - a bedroom flat somewhere.
    <br>You have now begun to manage your time - sometimes you sleep here, another time, there.
    <br>We are just telling you - this coming year, you cannot continue it.
    <br>It will be very dangerous for you.
    <br>Come out for your deliverance.
    <br>The brother I am talking about, please come out.
    <br>In confirmation of the prophecy, a man comes out of the congregation
    <br>and walks towards Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Are you not too young?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>I am confused.
    <br>You are confused?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You are confused?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>But this one is never confused!
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>If you are confused, this one will never be confused.
    <br>He said, I am confused.
    <br>If you are confused, can that place be confused?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[No!]
    <br>It is him that is confused but that place is a different place.
    <br>Next year, what you are doing secretly now - if you try it next year, you will die.
    <br>Because the woman you put in that place, they are tracing you and they will get you.
    <br>Very early in the morning, they will just find that they have killed you somewhere.
    <br>So, by the time you go to the other one, you will know you are confused.
    <br>He is a young man. You are very handsome; please don't let this world deceive you.
    <br>Okay? So, I want to see you.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>What has your real wife done to you?
    <br>Nothing, Man of God.
    <br>I will invite her.
    <br>How old are you?
    <br>Thirty-six years.
    <br>Okay, wait for me.
    <br>The other one, I will invite her.
    <br>We will pray with her and point her to her future success
    <br>and I will say, 'Please, leave my brother'.
    <br>All we are saying, leave my brother.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>The woman is not confused; this man is confused.
    <br>So, the one who is not confused should be able to tell the one who is,
    <br>"Please, go back to where you are coming from".
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These are the issues you will never ask the man of God to pray for you.
    <br>You will leave the important issue - you would be telling the man of God a different thing.
    <br>This is why we are here. Anything that could be dangerous for you,
    <br>you want Jesus to bring it and separate you from them.
    <br>I said he should bring the wife at home
    <br>and the wife at home is maybe hearing this for the first time.
    <br>My name is Mr Emmanuel.
    <br>I am from Togo.
    <br>The woman beside me is my wife, which I'm wedded with.
    <br>During the prophetic service on Saturday, the man of God prophesied
    <br>that there was a young man here who was married
    <br>but had secretly rented a house for another woman outside.
    <br>Immediately I heard it, I found it difficult to come out.
    <br>I waiting to see if someone else would come out.
    <br>Suddenly, it felt like there was a vibrating machine inside me.
    <br>My body could not be controlled any longer; everything was vibrating seriously.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>He said that when I was saying it, he was looking for someone to come out.
    <br>But before he finished looking round the church -
    <br>he looked at this side of the church but before he looked back,
    <br>something hit his heart.
    <br>You know Jesus loves you.
    <br>He has a way of taking you.
    <br>I mean, He is your Creator.
    <br>He said he could not breathe again.
    <br>He had to quickly come out.
    <br>I looked around but didn't see anyone else coming out.
    <br>At the time my body started vibrating, I started hearing, "Pack your things and run".
    <br>I don't know how I got to the front of the altar.
    <br>Everything the man of God said is completely true - one hundred percent true.
    <br>A woman was introduced to me by a friend who supplied sand to us.
    <br>She already had six children.
    <br>I was helping them.
    <br>One day, she discussed with me that as I was helping them,
    <br>she wanted to have a child with me which would be a point of contact between us
    <br>when I left the country.
    <br>I told her that if we did that, it could cause a problem for me
    <br>because I was a foreigner in the country.
    <br>She said I should know how to control the issue.
    <br>Finally, I started having an affair with her.
    <br>She then got pregnant and had a child for me.
    <br>My wife doesn't know anything of what I am saying now.
    <br>This is her first time of hearing all of these things.
    <br>So, this is the first time your wife is hearing this from you?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>She suspected me but I was not in a position to say anything to her.
    <br>That woman used the child to threaten me.
    <br>Whenever she asked for something
    <br>or asked me to come to her house, which I didn't want to do,
    <br>she would say she would carry her child - my child, and drop it at my house.
    <br>The woman is a family friend
    <br>but I didn't want anything that would cause a problem between me and my wife.
    <br>My wife took her as a sister and always did her hair for her.
    <br>During our wedding, she was with us and helped us with everything we were doing.
    <br>My wife thought she was my sister.
    <br>Ok. Madam, how are you?
    <br>You should thank God; you should not be disturbed.
    <br>It is the time now God wants to fortify this marriage.
    <br>If there is no marriage between you and him, I would let you know.
    <br>I see this is a relationship from God; this is a marriage from God.
    <br>No matter the case, like Apostle Paul said, "What can separate me from the love of Christ".
    <br>Whatever happened, don't worry.
    <br>So, for you to know that he is not fit.
    <br>Do you know the woman he is talking about?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I know the woman; she is like a sister, a family friend to me.
    <br>During our wedding, she organised her own committee of friends
    <br>and did her own committee of friends personally
    <br>because we were close together.
    <br>She is like a sister and family friend to us.
    <br>She has six children already.
    <br>The seventh one - I thought it was the woman's son.
    <br>I didn't know the seventh one is my husband's son.
    <br>I am here; I am confused and don't know what to do.
    <br>Please.
    <br>Are you hearing it for the first time now?
    <br>Yes, this is my first time to hear this.
    <br>Ok, it's alright.
    <br>I think the woman is around?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Because she is ... Madam, why are you panting?
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>So, I'm the one who said they should bring the woman.
    <br>She never knew you would be here; she never knew it would be like this.
    <br>Maybe, she probably thought I want to cement their marriage.
    <br>Ok, it's alright.
    <br>Madam, don't worry. After the service, I need to see the family.
    <br>But simple, viewers - what I want to see them for is simple.
    <br>Next Sunday, they will come out to give testimony.
    <br>This is your wife.
    <br>Okay?
    <br>I will...
    <br>Mr & Mrs Emmanuel - Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Please forgive me.
    <br>Ok, it's alright.
    <br>So, I will meet the other woman, and I will talk to her.
    <br>But one thing is clear.
    <br>That child is this family's child.
    <br>You cannot reject him; he is your husband's child.
    <br>But she will leave your marriage and God will forgive your husband and forgive her.
    <br>The child belongs to this family. Okay?
    <br>But I want to assure you, this marriage is yours.
    <br>I will let you see the reason why you can't leave the marriage.
    <br>You will begin to enjoy the joy of this marriage from now on.
    <br>Okay? I will be meeting you people.
    <br>So, the woman should wait.
    <br>Thank you. The evangelists will meet the woman, entertain her
    <br>and give her a place to sit. She should not run away.
    <br>Madam, give me your hand.
    <br>Did you listen to me?
    <br>Ok, it's alright. I will see you.
    <br>Ok, go and wait for me.
    <br>Mr & Mrs Emmanuel - Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I know it doesn't mean anything to many of us here.
    <br>Some would just laugh over there and say, "Ah, see o!"
    <br>The day God will catch up with you, you will know it means a lot!
    <br>Some say, "Hehe! No problem".
    <br>The day God will catch up with you!
    <br>Ok. So, thank you.
    <br>I will personally see the woman and settle the matter.
    <br>The woman will go for deliverance today, prayer today, and she will quit the marriage.
    <br>We don't want them to just quit the marriage with disagreement and hatred.
    <br>To quit this kind of relationship, the whole thing will be to understand both sides,.
    <br>and this man can continue --
    <br>I know for many of you, you see it differently.
    <br>Sometimes, God can speak good through the bad.
    <br>That is God for you.
    <br>I know many of you, because of this, you quit the marriage.
    <br>A lot of marriages - there are many people here who quit their marriage
    <br>because of what happened - that kind of thing.
    <br>But today, have you got the right marriage now?
    <br>Whatever happens, examine it in the light of God.
    <br>Anything that happens in your marriage, ask God what He says about it.
    <br>In every situation, what does He say?
    <br>The answer is not to quit but the first thing is to ask God His mind -
    <br>what is His opinion, His suggestion concerning what happened -
    <br>before you think of either quitting or staying.
    <br>When something happens, no matter how big, what does He say.
    <br>In every situation, God has something to say.
    <br>So, we don't just quit anything -
    <br>either marriage, relationship, business partnership or whatever -
    <br>whatever relationship at all.
    <br>No matter what happened.
    <br>If God first brought this relationship, it is the same God that will release you and release him,
    <br>not crisis, not situation.
    <br>We should not because of situation release ourselves or quit the relationship.
    <br>No matter the situation, what does He have to say
    <br>because He is the Father of the relationship.
    <br>If not, you will leave this relationship and meet someone who has quit a relationship because of trouble.
    <br>The two of you will meet.
    <br>You quit the relationship because of trouble
    <br>and you meet someone who quit a relationship because of trouble.
    <br>Two of you - two troubles will meet.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you quit this relationship because of trouble - either embarassment, betrayal or whatever -
    <br>and you quit, where will you get someone who has not quit a relationship before because of trouble?
    <br>If you quit this relationship without healing,
    <br>you will meet someone who quit a relationship without healing.
    <br>The two of you will meet.
    <br>The way you quit this relationship is the way you will meet the new relationship.
    <br>So much of the trouble we have today is because of the relationships we quit every day.
    <br>Business partner, marriage, friend - the way you quit them -
    <br>you just quit a relationship.
    <br>The person who is a criminal or is bad today, may be a messiah tomorrow, if you endure.
    <br>We have seen a person who you say betrayed you, disappointed you,
    <br>and you quit and leave him.
    <br>Now later, it is the same person you will meet in the future that stands to be your saviour.
    <br>You now say, "Ah!"
    <br>Life is just like that.
    <br>God owns our future. You don't know what the future holds.
    <br>The bad today can be the best tomorrow and the best today can be bad tomorrow.
    <br>The criminal today can be the saviour tomorrow.
    <br>A dishonest person can be trustworthy tomorrow.
    <br>I mean, life is just like that.
    <br>After the reconciliation with the family, Mr Emmanuel came back two weeks later
    <br>to testify of how God redeemed his marriage.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Mr Emmanuel.
    <br>I am from Togo.
    <br>The woman beside me is my wife.
    <br>I am married to a Nigerian; she is from Ebonyi State (Nigeria).
    <br>During the prophetic service on 10th December, the man of God prophesied that there is a man
    <br>here who secretly rented a house for another woman outside, who is me.
    <br>Today, we thank God.
    <br>After that, the man of God saw us, reconciled the family, counselled us and settled everything.
    <br>Now, I have received my child.
    <br>The child belongs to my wife and she will call my wife 'mother'.
    <br>I want to thank the man of God for him to allow himself to be used by God to settle this case.
    <br>Before I came here, I was like a man who was half dead.
    <br>I could not sleep. I did not have peace.
    <br>But since then, I can sleep; sometimes, my wife would be the one to wake me.
    <br>Before, I could wake up more than six times during the night.
    <br>Now, the love is different from before.
    <br>Now, we are living better than before, I know that this is the beginning of the wedding.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>That is a testimony after the prophecy and prayer by the man of God.
    <br>After meeting the family, he said his life is settled once again.
    <br>Before now, he was confused, restless; everthing was upside down.
    <br>There was no peace in his heart.
    <br>But now, there is peace.
    <br>The right knowledge of God has settled peace in the family.
    <br>So, let's hear from madam.
    <br>Mr Emmanuel & Wife - Reconciliation Testimony
    <br>My name is Mrs Chika.
    <br>I am a Nigerian, married to a Togolese.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>I am here to thank God for what He has done in our lives
    <br>through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for restoring our marriage and family.
    <br>I am here to thank God.
    <br>We are happy; the man of God has settled and counselled us.
    <br>We are happy. We are here to thank God for that.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Have you also forgiven your husband from your heart?
    <br>Yes, I have forgiven my husband, and I am ready to take the child as mine.
    <br>Amen. Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I don't have anything to say more than thank you because I didn't know a day like this would come.
    <br>Now, I love my wife more than before.
    <br>To my greatest surprise, she accepted the child as her own.
    <br>I thank God for everything.
    <br>I thank God Almighty, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Let's clap for Jesus one more time!
    <br>So, Madam, regarding this issue, can you tell us - you met with the man of God,
    <br>and the man of God through the power of the Holy Spirit has intervened in this matter --
    <br>We met with the man of God.
    <br>The man of God prophesied to me that I'm going to have my own baby.
    <br>So, I'm happy. I'm ready to take the child as mine.
    <br>Amen. Glory be to God! So, you could hear that.
    <br>The man of God also released a prophetic word to her
    <br>that now, as she prepares to take this child as her own child,
    <br>that God will through that act bless her.
    <br>She is coming back to also testify about that.
    <br>We believe that it shall be according to as God has spoken, in Jesus' name.
    <br>So, right now, without further ado, we'd like to invite the lady -
    <br>the child's mother - into our midst.
    <br>True to her word, Mrs Chika lovingly accepts the little child as her own biological child.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Just as she was divinely advised by the man of God and also promised to comply,
    <br>the madam has taken the child from the biological mother
    <br>and has accepted to take the child as her own child.
    <br>This is my son from now, and I'm happy.
    <br>Let us clap for Jesus!
    <br>Thank you. God bless you.
    <br>Madam, we thank God Almighty for everything.
    <br>We believe, having been invited here over this issue,
    <br>and God has intervened in this matter, what do you have to say?
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Charity.
    <br>I'm from Ebonyi State.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>I thank God for today.
    <br>I'm here to apologise to my sister
    <br>and hand over the child to the family
    <br>so that the wife will take care of the child.
    <br>I'm grateful.
    <br>I also thank the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for revealing it.
    <br>I really thank God.
    <br>I also ask her to forgive me and forget.
    <br>Ok, you have heard it all. Glory be to God in the highest!
    <br>Hallelujah! Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, madam, you have heard from the sister.
    <br>She is apologising for all that happened in the past.
    <br>We all know that all men make mistakes but mistakes are correctable.
    <br>By the grace of God, all the mistakes of the past have been corrected today,
    <br>and as she has spoken, what is your response, madam?
    <br>I have forgiven her .
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I have forgiven you.
    <br>Thank you. God bless you.
    <br>Now that this marriage has been sustained,
    <br>and God Almighty has restored this marriage,
    <br>what could have broken the marriage  
    <br> in the past
    <br>the Lord Almighty has taken care,
    <br>and today, the marriage has been cemented, even closer than ever before.
    <br>Madam, now that you have taken up this responsibility to take care of this child,
    <br>we also want to encourage you to do that faithfully,
    <br>knowing fully well that you are looking upon the face of God for your own blessing.
    <br>And as you take care of this child, as advised by the man of God himself,
    <br>this blessing will come speedily
    <br>and very soon you are coming back with your own child
    <br>to testify to the goodness of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>So, as from today, you have said that you have now become the mother of the boy,
    <br>and we also thank you for listening to the words of the anointed man of God.
