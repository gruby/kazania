  <p>    
    <br>During the Mexico Crusade with T.B. Joshua, one lady pushed through the crowd and cried out for help.
    <br>Let's watch what happened.
    <br>I cannot see for many years.
    <br>16 years.
    <br>You cannot see?
    <br>I cannot see, I cannot see long distances.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>As she fell to the floor, the man of God drew near and touched her once again
    <br>and the Holy Spirit completed the miracle.
    <br>Let's see her reaction as she realises what God has done for her.
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I can see!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ for my salvation.
    <br>I am free, by the power of the Holy Spirit!
    <br>I can see! I can see far. I can read this shirt, "Cruzada En México Con T.B. Joshua, Emmanuel TV."
    <br>I can see; I can read.
    <br>Before, I could not see.
    <br>For 15 years, I have not been able to distinguish people.
    <br>Christ lives!
    <br>After the amazing miracle she received in the Mexico Crusade with T.B. Joshua,
    <br>Yareli Domínguez García testified of how God completely restored her sight.
    <br>Now completely healed, we can see her walking freely and unaided.
    <br>One would never imagined that she had been losing her sight for 16 years.
    <br>Let's hear from her.
    <br>My name is Yareli Domínguez García, I come from Puebla, Mexico, and the person next to me is my mother.
    <br>The problem I had was that for 16 years, I couldn't see well.
    <br>I could not distinguish people or their features at a distance; I could not see their appearance.
    <br>I could not see anything close to me; I needed to wear glasses.
    <br>I could not see the computer well and I needed people close to me to help me to distinguish advertisements or people.
    <br>I had myopia, astigmatism and an infection for which I needed medication and creams.
    <br>To resolve these problems, I needed surgery because my myopia was severe.
    <br>However, even if I did the surgery, my sight would not be completely restored.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua started praying for my eyes,
    <br>I felt a really strong force within me trying to resist his prayer.
    <br>It wasn't me who wanted to stop him but the evil spirit inside of me that was manifesting.
    <br>At that moment, I did not have control over my mouth or body.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me for a final time, I felt this force leave me.
    <br>When I got up, I felt light.
    <br>When I felt light, I could see the screens and the people around me clearly.
    <br>I could also clearly see the people who were standing beside me.
    <br>Then, I started shouting that I was free.
    <br>Now that I can see perfectly, I don't need anybody to assist me anymore.
    <br>I can go up and down without any assistance.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Five years later, Yareli contacted Emmanuel TV to tell her story
    <br>of how Jesus transformed her life after the touch from heaven that she received
    <br>at the Mexico Crusade with T.B. Joshua, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Greetings in the name of Jesus!
    <br>My name is Yareli Domínguez García.
    <br>I am 34 years old and I greet you from my city, Puebla in Mexico.
    <br>I want to testify and glorify the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>I am very glad and grateful to God.
    <br>It has been five years since I attended the Mexico Crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I know that you all saw the physical healing I received in my sight
    <br>when I shouted, "I am free!" with joy because of my encounter with Jesus Christ!
    <br>I want to testify that it has been five years now that I have not worn glasses
    <br>and I give all glory to Jesus Christ.
    <br>I know you saw this testimony but I want to go beyond that.
    <br>Before I knew Jesus and His Word, I was a woman involved in so many youthful passions.
    <br>At five years old, I suffered sexual abuse.
    <br>My life turned upside down because at 5 years old,
    <br>I began to believe that I had affection for females like me.
    <br>I now understand that it was a spirit that had entered me
    <br>and caused me to have affection for my fellow women.
    <br>This lifestyle made me live with women,
    <br>have female partners and all sorts of perverse inclinations.
    <br>I was into drugs, alcohol and also frequented night clubs.
    <br>I was also addicted to smoking.
    <br>My lifestyle separated me from my mother.
    <br>This lifestyle resulted in loneliness, frustration, anger and bitterness.
    <br>I always used bad words and had a vulgar tongue.
    <br>I was rebellious against every authority that wanted to correct my life.
    <br>Deep within my heart, I was frustrated and unsatisfied.
    <br>This led me to think of committing suicide.
    <br>I thought this was the easiest way to end my life of misery and depression.
    <br>When the Gospel of Jesus was preached to me, I believed that Jesus Christ was my only hope.
    <br>Indeed, He was all I had.
    <br>But sometimes, thoughts of my past would come to haunt me like a giant
    <br>and I continued having affairs with women in the dream and desiring this life of parties within me.
    <br>My past pursued me relentlessly because I was still not free.
    <br>But during this time, I started watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>and I could see that in the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua, there was real freedom -
    <br>Christ truly dwelling inside of people.
    <br>When I saw him, I had hope and understood that the Word of God was real.
    <br>God's mercy located me and I said this because after praying fervently for my deliverance,
    <br>I heard that the man of God was coming to Mexico.
    <br>I knew that God had answered my prayer.
    <br>I did everything to attend the Crusade in Mexico with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>not only expecting physical healing of my eyes but also the spiritual healing that I needed.
    <br>I wanted to be delivered.
    <br>While standing in the prayer line, you could see all that happened -
    <br>how the man of God touched my eyes.
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me, the demon inside of me spoke out.
    <br>Then, I excitedly jumped up, as you could all see, because when he touched me
    <br>I knew that the kingdom of darkness in my life had come to an end.
    <br>Finally, I was totally free and the nightmare was over!
    <br>That is why when I stood up at the Aztec Stadium, I shouted, "I am free!"
    <br>I was so excited because in my heart, I had total conviction about my deliverance.
    <br>After that encounter with the man of God, it has been five years
    <br>and I would like to share with you what Jesus Christ has done in my life.
    <br>I am no longer using glasses.
    <br>My health continues to improve.
    <br>While driving and walking, I can clearly see different advertisements on the billboards.
    <br>Whenever I am driving, people don't need to tell me where the speed bumps are.
    <br>After I was delivered from the spirit of woman, I developed a natural affection for men.
    <br>I find it very difficult to understand that I even had a past with women.
    <br>Now, I dream of becoming a mother.
    <br>Now, I believe in marriage - something I couldn't conceive before.
    <br>Another testimony that I want to share is that I couldn't advance in my career
    <br>but I've been studying Theology for the last three years
    <br>and this year, I will be graduating.
    <br>To the glory of God, all my grades have been excellent.
    <br>Jesus Christ has not only worked on me but on my family as well.
    <br>We had been renting for almost 20 years and this resulted in financial difficulties.
    <br>I wasn't able to study or pay different expenses.
    <br>But today, we own a comfortable two-storey house.
    <br>It is the kind of house we've always dreamt of.
    <br>Even with this salary for 50 years, we would not have been able to get a house like this.
    <br>It wasn't possible for us but it was possible with God!
    <br>I give thanks and all the glory to God.
    <br>Indeed, the financial setback in our family has been broken!
    <br>Sincerely, I wouldn't be able to finish testifying about all the miracles, signs and wonders
    <br>that God has performed in my life and my family.
    <br>If you asked me what my advice would be to people, I would say to all who are watching:
    <br>There is hope in Jesus Christ; you just need to get closer to Him.
    <br>Believe in His prophets.
    <br>I believed with all my heart.
    <br>I believe in the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>That's why I attended the crusade with faith.
    <br>Don't hesitate to attend crusades with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and experience God's presence.
    <br>I guarantee you one thing: The next person to share their testimony will be you!
