  <p>    
    <br>My name is Cheniku Killian
    <br>from Cameroon
    <br>and this is my wife from Cameroon.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I, first of all, want to ask forgiveness from God and from the man of God and Emmanuel TV team
    <br>for speaking against them.
    <br>Let God's mercy be upon me.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>I was a drunkard, a womaniser -
    <br>in fact everything that you know is bad.
    <br>In a beer parlour, I would sit and speak against the man of God.
    <br>I never believed Prophet TB Joshua was a prophet of God,
    <br>and I never believed that he was from God.
    <br>When we would drink, we would speak against him, criticise him and say everything about him.
    <br>I was surprised one day, I sat in my house
    <br>and didn't know there was something wrong with me.
    <br>I was struggling to come out of a situation,
    <br>but I never knew my solution would come from God.
    <br>Because whenever I would pray before I slept,
    <br>something would come and beat me in the dream.
    <br>Then I decided not to pray again,
    <br>because when I prayed I would instantly feel an attack.
    <br>So, I no longer prayed before I slept.
    <br>One day, I was watching football in my house when the channel went off.
    <br>As it went off, I took the remote control and I was changing from one channel to another.
    <br>I happened to see Emmanuel TV.
    <br>As I saw Emmanuel TV, I said, "Ah, this fake man again".
    <br>Something just told me, "Why can't you watch it for one minute?
    <br>Just watch it. Look at it".
    <br>I said, "Alright. Let me see".
    <br>I allowed it and I started watching.
    <br>I saw one man from Ghana who was testifying.
    <br>He also said that he was a womaniser and a drunkard,
    <br>and when he prayed with Prophet TB Joshua, he was delivered.
    <br>I said, "Come on!
    <br>How do you expect someone in Nigeria to command for you to receive deliverance while you are in Ghana?
    <br>This is fake!".
    <br>That testimony passed.
    <br>Another person came and gave the same testimony.
    <br>I said, "This man is fake!".
    <br>This man has been moving from Ghana to Nigeria, from Nigeria to Ghana, at the same time.
    <br>I wanted to change the channel but something said, "No, keep on watching.
    <br>Maybe this might be the solution to your problem".
    <br>I continued watching.
    <br>During the womanising,
    <br>even without having money to buy,
    <br>I would go and borrow beer to drink.
    <br>As I was watching, Prophet TB Joshua came out
    <br>and he made a statement.
    <br>Deep down in me I already knew I was a sinner condemned to hell;
    <br>so there was no need to follow God.
    <br>He made a statement that when you sin,
    <br>don't run away from God, run to God.
    <br>I said, "Huh?"
    <br>Mr and Mrs Cheniku Killian

    <br>He said, "There is no sin that cannot be forgiven".
    <br>I said, "After all these things that I have done -
    <br>I abandoned my wife in the village
    <br>and I was womanising everywhere.
    <br>Does that mean my sins can be forgiven?".
    <br>I said, "Alright, let me watch and see".
    <br>I was just watching and watching.
    <br>He started praying - the mass prayer.
    <br>As he was praying,
    <br>he said, "Viewers all over the world" - three times.
    <br>Something just said, "Why not go and touch the screen?".
    <br>I said, "Let me just go and try".
    <br>As I was moving,
    <br>and as I stretched my hand towards the screen -
    <br>I had not even touched the screen -
    <br>I felt a serious shock
    <br>and something left me.
    <br>As something left me, I abandoned the screen
    <br>and ran outside to open the door to verify who left my body.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>And we can see on the side of the screen
    <br>the Viewers Prayer on Emmanuel TV
    <br>where our brother said that he touched the screen -
    <br>not even touching.
    <br>He said a huge shock shook his whole body
    <br>and a human being left his body;
    <br>he felt as if something left.
    <br>As I felt something left, I ran out.
    <br>I was looking everywhere for who had left my body
    <br>because I felt a complete human being - complete with head and everything - left.
    <br>I said, "How can this happen?".
    <br>When I came back to myself I rushed back to the room.
    <br>Since then, the womanising and those things just left.
    <br>Before that I had no affection for my wife.
    <br>Immediately after that I started thinking, "I have a queen somewhere".
    <br>I said, "Yes, that man can be a true man of God
    <br>and now he is a true man of God".
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>The very person I criticised was the same person that God used to deliver me.
    <br>I said that I cannot keep this; 
    <br>I must come and testify in Nigeria.
    <br>Mr and Mrs Cheniku Killian
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>The evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed!
    <br>Can you just tell us the change in your life?
    <br>Tell us before how that womanising, spirit of drunkenness, destroyed your life.
    <br>And now what is the difference?
    <br>Before, I was womanising.
    <br>My business wasn't moving.
    <br>I had nothing.
    <br>Even if I had money, I would just go directly to the beer parlour.
    <br>Now, my business has changed.
    <br>I am fine - you can see my wife and know how we are living now.
    <br>Mr and Mrs Cheniku Killian
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Let's hear a word from your wife
    <br>to find out the difference in the life of her husband -
    <br>a difference that only Jesus Christ could make.
    <br>Madam you are welcome.
    <br>Please tell us your name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Cheniku Killian.
    <br>I am from Cameroon.
    <br>My husband has said everything.
    <br>I really thank God for setting my husband free.
    <br>Thank God!
    <br>I really thank God!
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>She says that she thanks Jesus for setting her husband free.
    <br>We would like to hear from him once again.
    <br>Sir, can you just tell us what advice do you have for people all over the world?
    <br>Maybe this spirit of lust has held them captive,
    <br>drunkenness - they feel they can't get out of this.
    <br>Like you said, you felt that you were condemned to hell;
    <br>that there is no point in following God,
    <br>because already you are a sinner.
    <br>People want to hear from you.
    <br>What would you advise them?
    <br>My advice is especially for my friends,
    <br>because I had so many friends that I was with.
    <br>Most of them are surprised that I have suddenly changed,
    <br>and there is breakthrough following me, one after the other.
    <br>This is the secret:
    <br>If you find yourself condemning a man of God
    <br>go down on your knees and ask for mercy.
    <br>Mr and Mrs Cheniku Killian
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>I was doing this out of ignorance; I didn't know anything.
    <br>Because people were saying that Prophet TB Joshua was not a man of God
    <br>I would join them and start criticising him.
    <br>I never knew that my solution would come from him.
    <br>Follow God and you will be free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen. We know in God's mercy no one is excluded.
    <br>And sir, you mentioned before that when you used to pray, the nightmare, the attack would even be more.
    <br>So you decided to stop praying.
    <br>Can you tell us now what is your prayer life like and do you still experience those attacks?
    <br>Now, I pray well,
    <br>I read my Bible, I study the Bible
    <br>and now we are very fine.
    <br>No problem, no nightmare, no attack.
    <br>Everything is over!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God for your life
    <br>and for the miracle of this salvation in your life.
    <br>And we want to advise you that remember receiving that salvation is not enough.
    <br>You have to continue to follow Jesus Christ along the way;
    <br>receiving His instruction
    <br>and honouring Him in all you do, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
