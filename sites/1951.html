  <p>    
    <br>Get ready to hear this important statement from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Following the announcement that church services will resume in Lagos on August 9th 2020 -
    <br>that is, this coming Sunday - I wish to commend the authorities for their efforts so far.
    <br>However, having heard from the authorities, we are now waiting to hear from God.
    <br>Please be assured that as soon as we hear from God, we will inform you when our services will resume.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
