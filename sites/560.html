  <p>    
    <br>Watch as God uses Prophet T.B. Joshua to separate the darkness from light in the lives of these people.
    <br>The right hand of God is power.
    <br>The lighting of God is moving through Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to meet the needs of people from all over the world.
    <br>As he walks among the visitors during the first service giving words of prophecy,
    <br>he swiftly moves to a certain man at the back.
    <br>Brother, don't run from me. God loves you, give me your hand.
    <br>You will come to the prayer line today.I will see you there, OK?
    <br>I will see you. I am your friend. Please don't run from me. I love you.
    <br>He says he is scared.
    <br>You are scared?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What is disturbing him is that mine is positive, his own is negative and I want to deliver him.
    <br>That’s correct.
    <br>It's true.
    <br>Later in the second service, the same man awaits his meeting with the man of God
    <br>in the prayer line of The SCOAN.
    <br>Many others too await this encounter with the problem solver Jesus Christ.
    <br>They have come from different countries with different hopes, different expectations, but with one assurance,
    <br>Jesus is who He says He is and He can do what He says He can do.
    <br>Let us see what will happen next.
    <br>This is the promised meeting the man of God prophesied about in the first service.
    <br>Martien is now receiving prayer from the Prophet
    <br>and is undergoing deliverance from the many problems he came with.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>What is happening during the prayer goes to show that we are in a warfare.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is not fighting a natural situation.
    <br>He is not fighting against flesh and blood but against what we cannot see.
    <br>It's a spiritual battle.
    <br>Let's watch the operation of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Look as he grabs the chair fearlessly attempts to attack the Prophet
    <br>He is being pushed by the negative spirit the man of God had spoken about earlier,
    <br>but because of the power and the anointing of God in the life of Prophet T.B Joshua,
    <br>he is unable to succeed.
    <br>There is nothing God cannot command, control and instruct,
    <br>all power in Heaven and on earth has been invested in that name Jesus Christ.
    <br>Right now you can see his muscles are extremely tense, he's gripping his chair, tensions on the rise.
    <br>It seems like he wants to attack the Prophet again.
    <br>Maybe he wants to go for round two.
    <br>The aggression in him is just too much.
    <br>Well, satan can only attempt but he cannot succeed
    <br>because greater is He who is in the Prophet than he who is in this man.
    <br>Oh look at the tattoo on his arm.
    <br>Look at the ring in his eyebrow, the expression on his face.
    <br>Hold on - the Prophet is calling him.
    <br>Could this be round two?
    <br>Well, there is only one way to find out, let's watch.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Do you think the battle is over?
    <br>Hmmm..... wow, he's smiling.
    <br>Do you want to hit me?
    <br>No, it's something inside me.
    <br>Something inside of you?
    <br>And I want to deliver you,
    <br>so remaining just two; you'll be free, OK.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Stand up; come back.
    <br>Demons are going out because they are commanded to go in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>This is the power of God in action.
    <br>Deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>His expression says it all. Satan is powerless in the face of God's amour and weapons.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, be free!
    <br>Be delivered, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Don't ask yourself whether you are free or not. This is a testimony that you are free.
    <br>As Martien stands up, the look on his face clearly shows
    <br>that his life has been turned from one of frustration to fulfilment.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Now am delivered! Thank God. I am free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>I thank God of Prophet Joshua; T.B Joshua is a real man of God.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Sir, you are welcome here to The SCOAN here in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Can you please tell us your name, your age and the country you come from?
    <br>My name is Martien. I am from Holland and I am 42 years old.
    <br>What was the problem that you were having before you came to The SCOAN
    <br>and can you just tell us some of the experiences that you were having.
    <br>The reason I came to The SCOAN is that I had a very bad violent nature
    <br>and because of that I was so scared. I tried to kill myself several times.
    <br>After that I felt I had no meaning in my life, no role, no purpose.
    <br>I became very violent and it became worse and worse and worse
    <br>until I heard voices in my head that led me to do some things.
    <br>When I was walking in the street, I hit people very bad. I could knock people down.
    <br>I was in jail for it also. I almost killed people.
    <br>So you are saying that the spirit of anger was such a strong spirit
    <br>that it caused you to do things to the point that you ended up in jail?
    <br>Yes
    <br>So when you came to The SCOAN, we understand that during the service of the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, that he actually came over to you and he said something to you.
    <br>Can you just tell us, what did the Prophet say to you?
    <br>He said that I am your friend, you don't have to be scared.
    <br>Because when I came into the church, I felt a very big power of God and I tried to hide from it
    <br>because I thought God wanted to judge me or something like that.
    <br>Brother, don't run from me. God loves you. Give me your hand.
    <br>You will come to the prayer line today. I will see you there.
    <br>OK?
    <br>I will see you. I am your friend. Please don't run from me. I love you.
    <br>He says he is scared.
    <br>You are scared?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What is disturbing him is mine is positive, his own is negative and I want to deliver him.
    <br>That’s correct.
    <br>It's true.
    <br>When your life is controlled by demons,
    <br>it is not easy to describe or explain when something takes control of you.
    <br>I was pushed to digging up graves, to dig up the coffins and open them.
    <br>It's difficult to explain because it was something inside of me that controlled my life.
    <br>So you are saying that the demons in your life controlled you to such an effect
    <br>that it would cause you to dig up graves, go to the graveyard, attack people and do all sorts of evil.
    <br>- Is that right?
    <br>- Yes, that's right.
    <br>So you came to The SCOAN - we will just bring you back to what happened during the service.
    <br>After the man of God met you and said do not be afraid,
    <br>we understand that the same day you were arranged in the prayer line.
    <br>Can you just tell us what was your experience at the prayer line.
    <br>What was actually going through your mind at the time and just tell us how you were feeling?
    <br>Well, the night before that I slept so bad because I knew something was going to happen.
    <br>Something controlled my body again and I became so angry and I wanted to attack him.
    <br>It was a miracle because I grabbed the chair and I actually wanted to hit him with it.
    <br>I also wanted to kick him but there was a power that stopped me.
    <br>When he was doing like this, a power came over me and I fell down.
    <br>Normally for me that is not normal because I am strong enough.
    <br>But then I fell down on the ground and a very big peace came over me
    <br>and something in me at that moment was coming out of me and now it's gone.
    <br>Oh hallelujah, clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>So you were wonderfully, fantastically delivered in the power of the Holy Spirit
    <br>by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>So how do you feel now?
    <br>You said you have a wonderful peace that has come over you.
    <br>How do you feel in your mind now, in your body? How are you feeling right now?
    <br>I am feeling very very quiet. Peaceful, and not a feeling of becoming angry anymore, not at all.
    <br>And are you hearing any voices anymore to tell you to do what you used to do?
    <br>No no, not anymore, Jesus set me free.
    <br>Oh hallelujah, clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>So Jesus Christ has completely delivered you and set you free, we thank God.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ once again for that wonderful healing, wonderful deliverance.
    <br>At last I want to say one last thing.
    <br> It is a nightmare when your whole life is controlled by violent nature.
    <br>And satan, I want to tell you now, I am free, God set me free.
    <br>Oh hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>So now that Jesus Christ has completely delivered you and set you free, you are now peaceful.
    <br>What is your promise to Him?
    <br>I want to serve God.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Well, we pray with you that God will give you that special grace to do just that
    <br>and to go and sin no more, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you very much. Clap for wonderful Jesus Christ once again.
    <br>After testifying to the goodness of God in his life,
    <br>Martien prepares to return to Holland to live his life anew.
    <br>Just before he goes, he shares his experience one more time
    <br>I feel happy inside and since Sunday, I have become very very sensitive.
    <br>Since several times, I had to cry cry cry, it's the love of God.
    <br>I cannot explain it but I am happy.
    <br>I feel that something has come out of me; I have no feelings of anger again.
    <br>It's real; it's not fake.
    <br>When the rest of the Holy Spirit came over me, you could see I was knocked down on the ground
    <br>but with peace, peace in my heart.
    <br>It was really a touch of God on me.
    <br>Otherwise, if the prophet was not really a man of God,
    <br>I would have knocked him down; I can tell you that.
    <br>He is a man of God. I have never seen a man like him.
    <br>I have visited so many churches in Holland but I never saw power like this.
    <br>It is a very big expression.
    <br>He is really a man of God.
    <br>One thing I have learned is to look on God, no matter how great your faith is.
    <br>You have to express your faith in God in your life and then all miracles can happen in your life.
    <br>That's what I have learned here.
    <br>That’s fantastic, sir.
    <br>We pray with you that God Almighty will give you a safe journey home
    <br>and the grace to maintain all the peace and joy you have received here, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
