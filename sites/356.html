  <h3>
    356 - T.B. JOSHUA - Why THE FIRE has REDUCED in CHURCH!
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I want to believe that I am in the midst of ministers of God.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>As a minister of the Gospel, I would want us to talk as the Spirit has given us.
    <br>The message is all about our future as ministers of the Gospel -
    <br>my future and your future as ministers of the Gospel.
    <br>Our future is being challenged by modern-day circumstances.
    <br>There are so many challenges.
    <br>The Gospel, the power, the grace -
    <br>you are expecting more fire but it's like, the fire is going down.
    <br>This will lead us to the message title:
    <br>THE UNION OF THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT
    <br>This is the challenge we have today - the union of the Word and the Spirit.
    <br>It's like, they are not getting along in the church today.
    <br>They are not getting along in the church today.
    <br>This is the Word; this is the Spirit.
    <br>We cannot talk about the two of them in separation.
    <br>It is biblically incorrect.
    <br>They are one.
    <br>They must immerse.
    <br>I will not use the word 'join' but 'immerse' - it is the word 'immersion'.
    <br>This will take us to the Book of John 6.
    <br>I will start my reading from verse 1, and then straight to the proof text - verse 63.
    <br>"Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee
    <br>and a great crowd of people followed him
    <br>because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick.
    <br>Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.
    <br>The Jewish Passover Festival was near.
    <br>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him,
    <br>he said to Philip, 'Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?' "
    <br>I will take it from John 6:56.
    <br>"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me...
    <br>Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father..."
    <br>John 6:63:
    <br>"The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing.
    <br>The words I have spoken to you - they are Spirit and life."
    <br>What Jesus is saying here:
    <br>We cannot continue to talk, preach and teach about the two -
    <br>the Word and the Spirit, in separation.
    <br>But when we look at what is happening in the ministry today,
    <br>churches are known for one or the other.
    <br>It is either this church is known for the preaching and teaching,
    <br>while the other is known for miracles, signs and wonders.
    <br>This is not how it should be.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Luke 24:19.
    <br>" 'What things?' he asked. 'About Jesus of Nazareth,' they replied.
    <br>'He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people'."
    <br>The early church stood strong in the doctrine and the power of the Lord.
    <br>The same thing should happen today.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Why should the same thing happen?
    <br>Because of our Standard, Strength, Life, All, Roadmap,
    <br>a Friend closer than a brother, the One who has no beginning and no end,
    <br>the One who is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Jesus Christ is our Standard, Roadmap, a Friend closer than a brother.
    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>The union of the Word and the Spirit has been challenged
    <br>by modern-day circumstances.
    <br>What are the challenges?
    <br>Man's natural gifts - abilities, talents and education.
    <br>Today, people don't know that when you study the Word in university
    <br>or theology school, you cannot study the Spirit.
    <br>There is nowhere you can study the Spirit.
    <br>People study the Word today and believe that it is all
    <br>but the main thing about Christianity is not the work we do
    <br>but the relationship we maintain.
    <br>It is this relationship we maintain that brings about the Spirit.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Today, we preach the Word alone without being carried along by the Spirit.
    <br>That is why the name, Jesus we call seems to be inactive,
    <br>idle and meaningless because we are not being carried along.
    <br>We pray without the Spirit of God.
    <br>We preach without the Spirit of God.
    <br>We teach without the Spirit of God.
    <br>People will hear us; we will entertain people but God will not hear us.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>There must be harmony between the Word and the Spirit.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When we read the Bible with devotion -
    <br>with openness and hunger for it, the Word will enter our hearts.
    <br>And the Bible says,
    <br>it is when this Word comes into our heart that the Spirit acts.
    <br>When the Spirit acts with the Word, it renews our strength.
    <br>Today, when we preach without being carried along by the Spirit,
    <br>we preach of ourselves, we entertain people.
    <br>These are the challenges we are having today
    <br>and oftentimes destruction comes.
    <br>This is why I said our future as Christians and ministers
    <br>depends on our learning from each other.
    <br>What you have and I do not have, give me.
    <br>What I have and you do not have, I will give you.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>This is the cause of fights today.
    <br>What I have and you do not have, makes you to envy me,
    <br>be jealous of me, fight me and call me all sorts of names.
    <br>What you have and I do not have makes me to envy you,
    <br>be jealous of you and fight you.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>We preach about the two in separation.
    <br>We preach about the two - the Spirit and the Word - in separation.
    <br>When we continue to preach, teach or pray, "Be healed, be delivered",
    <br>our words will remain inactive, idle, meaningless and oftentimes, destructive.
    <br>Destructive means challenges because oftentimes, when you pray in separation
    <br>between the Word and the Spirit, "Be delivered"
    <br>if you cannot deliver the patient, the patient will deliver you.
    <br>Remember the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>The word, 'One day' means oftentimes, they had been praying for people.
    <br>they had been in that business for so many years but one day,
    <br>they met a stiff opposition, strong opposition.
    <br>"Be delivered" but the opposition delivered them.
    <br>That is, the sickness in this man would be given to you.
    <br>This is what is happening to many ministers of God today.
    <br>In the process of praying for people in the Word, without being carried along by the Spirit,
    <br>you will end up being delivered.
    <br>Listen once again.
    <br>In the process of praying for people without being carried along by the Spirit,
    <br>we will end up being delivered by the person we are praying for.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Our reward as ministers of the Gospel is not just mere money.
    <br>Our reward is not just mere fame.
    <br>Our reward as ministers of God is not just mere popularity.
    <br>Our reward as ministers of the Gospel of Christ is peace of heart.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Again.
    <br>Our reward as ministers of the Gospel is not just mere money.
    <br>It is not just mere fame - everywhere your name is known.
    <br>It is not just mere popularity - having churches all over the world
    <br>or having the largest crowd.
    <br>No, our reward is peace of heart.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Many today believe that when a minister of God pulls a large crowd,
    <br>has churches all over the world and has the largest congregation, fame everywhere,
    <br>popularity, wealth, riches, they say he is a minister of the Gospel.
    <br>Movie actors, artists and musicians all over the world have all this.
    <br>What are we talking about?
    <br>We are talking about the peace of heart.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>What is the cause of fights in the church today?
    <br>What is the cause of envy among the ministers?
    <br>What is the cause of jealousy among the churches and ministers of God?
    <br>It is because we have no peace of heart.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>What is peace of heart?
    <br>Peace of heart is contentment.
    <br>We are not content; I am not content; you are not content -
    <br>there is need to fight.
    <br>It is when you are content that you will see yourself as God sees you
    <br>and you will say you are what God says you are.
    <br>You will not look at others to judge yourself.
    <br>You will not compare yourself to others.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>If I am content, I will not compare myself to you -
    <br>whether you are bigger than me or smaller than me, glory be to God!
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When I am content, I will say, "I am what God says I am".
    <br>When I am content, I will say, "I have what God says I have".
    <br>When I am content, I will say, "I can do what God says I can do".
    <br>If I am content, I will say, "No one is like me".
    <br>I will be content.
    <br>We can never be content in the ministry when we continue to preach
    <br>and teach about the two in separation.
    <br>You can never be content.
    <br>The Word is like an object.
    <br>The Spirit is like a machine that pulls the object.
    <br>She is word - the spirit...
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Now, with no one to push you, you cannot move.
    <br>If you continue to talk about the Word,
    <br>you will continue to find yourself the same way.
    <br>As a minister of God, if you preach only the Word, you will amass wealth -
    <br>you will have money and fame.
    <br>People will listen to you because you are charismatic,
    <br>have speaking skills and ability to inspire people.
    <br>You would have money, fame and popularity.
    <br>Without the Spirit of God, you can never have peace of heart.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Ministers of God here today, don't compare yourself to anyone.
    <br>Your little congregation or big congregation -
    <br>if yours is little and you have peace of heart
    <br>and the one who has a big congregation is without peace of heart - he's zero
    <br>but you - correct!
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>You, big congregation and you, little congregation,
    <br>remember what the Bible says: The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>It's a matter of time.
    <br>You who preach without the Spirit, it is a matter of time.
    <br>After a while, you will disappear.
    <br>You - everlasting.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I think I have to come down now and practise what I have preached.
    <br>If you say you have the Spirit of Father,
    <br>you preach the Word and the Spirit; it is a matter of time.
    <br>The result is fire.
    <br>You will speak with fire, you will pray with fire and you will preach with fire.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I want to give a piece of advice:
    <br>Seek first the Kingdom, not the crowd.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When you first seek the Kingdom, the crowd will come later.
    <br>Seek first the Kingdom and what is the Kingdom?
    <br>The Spirit of God,
    <br>the Spirit of the Father.
    <br>What makes you different?
    <br>If there is any difference between me and a good speaker,
    <br>an inspirational speaker - someone when you give them the mic to talk,
    <br>you would be marvelled because of the message and eloquent speech.
    <br>If there is any difference between me and anyone, glory be to God,
    <br>I will never preach or teach about the two in separation
    <br>because I would not be able to stand the test of time.
    <br>If you want to stand the test of time because the Bible says,
    <br>Jesus said to us, "I pray your faith will not fail",
    <br>it means there will be challenges.
    <br>He said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>It means there will be challenges.
    <br>It means there will be trouble.
    <br>There will be trials.
    <br>He said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>He had foreseen that there would be troubles;
    <br>cheer up, the Spirit of the Father will stand for you.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Take note of this, faith is perfected by our acting on the Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Faith is perfected by our acting on the Word."
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>Faith is perfected by our acting on the Word.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>Let's open the Book of Mark 16:18.
    <br>"They will pick up snakes with their hands and when they drink any deadly poison,
    <br>it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on the sick..."
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>Place our hands on the sick and they shall recover.
    <br>What does it mean?
    <br>This means nothing until we act on the Word.
    <br>Nothing will happen until we act on the Word.
    <br>But today, we go by what we read.
    <br>They shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover.
    <br>People are now laying their hands on the sick without the Spirit of God.
    <br>'They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover' - means nothing
    <br>until we act on the Word.
    <br>Nothing until we act on the Word.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Looking into the Word and acting on it brings Jesus on the scene.
    <br>THE UNION OF THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT
    <br>Again.
    <br>Looking into the Word and acting on it brings Jesus on the scene.
    <br>When you say, "In the name of Jesus" and you are not looking into and acting
    <br>on the Word, Jesus will not come to the scene,
    <br>Jesus will not come to the place, Jesus will not come to the spot -
    <br>Jesus will not come.
    <br>The people you pray for will hear you, you will hear yourself;
    <br>Jesus will not hear you.
    <br>If Jesus does not hear you, what happens?
    <br>Attacks and challenges, when Jesus doesn't hear you.
    <br>How do we act on the Word?
    <br>By meditating and turning it over and over in our hearts.
    <br>By meditating and turning over and over what we have read in our hearts.
    <br>Again.
    <br>By meditating on the Word, on each Word we read,
    <br>and turning it over and over in our hearts.
    <br>I mean, thinking over and over what you have read.
    <br>The more you think about what you read, the more you become familiar with His voice.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>I want to leave you in faith.
    <br>As we continue, the Spirit of God will guide us.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>I want to pray with you.
    <br>I want to ask God to give you the grace, to receive a hearing heart.
    <br>You need a hearing heart.
    <br>Your hands up, a hearing heart; ask God to give you a hearing heart.
    <br>Ask God for a hearing heart, a heart that hears and obeys.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>A hearing heart.
    <br>I pray the door of your heart, open.
    <br>Be opened!
    <br>I say, be opened, in the name of Jesus, be opened!
    <br>Be opened, in the name of Jesus, be opened!
    <br>I say, be opened, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and ask God.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Ask God for the grace not to be ignorant of your faith under the pressure of temptation.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Ask God for the grace, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Listen once again:
    <br>Not to be ignorant of your faith under the pressure of temptation, trouble, trial, burden.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>I command the Spirit of God -
    <br>I say, "Be alive", your heart be alive!
    <br>Your spirit, be alive!
    <br>I say, your spirit be alive, your heart be alive!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name, we pray.
    <br>The Word I spoke to you are Spirit and they are life.
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The Word I speak to you - they are Spirit and they are life.
    <br>I say, "Be alive!"
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The ministers of God, raise your hands up.
    <br>If you are a minister of the Gospel, raise your hands up.
    <br>The right hand of God is power!
    <br>Wave your hand.
    <br>The right hand of God is power!
    <br>Receive!
    <br>Your hands - up.
    <br>Receive!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, receive!
    <br>Receive!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>There is no way you can know that you have received the Spirit of the Father,
    <br>until you have an encounter or you have challenges.
    <br>You will still begin to think you are the same person
    <br>but you are a different person.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When I was coming, I saw the sick people out there.
    <br>This is a pastors' conference.
    <br>Well, we cannot abandon them; we have to attend to them too.
    <br>But you, pastors, will pray for them to confirm God's Word in your life.
    <br>There is truth in God's Word; the Spirit of the Father reveals the truth.
    <br>There is healing in God's Word; the Spirit of the Father reveals the healing.
    <br>There is deliverance in God's Word;
    <br>the Spirit of the Father reveals the deliverance.
    <br>If you have received that Spirit of the Father, you will heal people,
    <br>deliver and set the captives free.
    <br>Colombia Pastors' Conference
