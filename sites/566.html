    <br>The real, authentic and forceful power of the most high God
    <br>exercises through the faculties of Wise Man Christopher
    <br>as he prays for all present in The SCOAN auditorium for the salvation of their souls.
    <br>Here is a stiff opposition - a demon that had been hiding in this body,
    <br>exposed by the light of God.
    <br>Let us watch how darkness has no hiding place in this encounter with Wise Man Christopher.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I am a simple spirit, just take it easy.
    <br>I am a gentleman, just take it easy.
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>We are three.
    <br>Mention yourselves.
    <br>I am the queen of the coast, idol from his mother's house and idol from his father's house.
    <br>I can never leave this body because I love this man more than any other man.
    <br>But this is a man?
    <br>This person standing here is a man but I am a woman in him.
    <br>What are you doing in him?
    <br>He is my husband
    <br>As a wife, what have you done to this man, his career and his marriage?
    <br>This man you see here is a stupid man.
    <br>I told him not to have any affair with any woman,
    <br>that anything he wants in his life, I will give it to him.
    <br>He did not go to school; he only passed elementary 6
    <br>but he teaches in a secondary school.
    <br>I gave him brains.
    <br>If you see this man preaching, you will think that he is the one that wrote the Bible.
    <br>Since he cheated my love, he married a stupid woman.
    <br>Who is this stupid woman?
    <br>That woman - I am dragging him with that woman.
    <br>I told that woman that I would leave him for her but she must suffer.
    <br>There is somebody standing next to you, by your right.
    <br>Who is this woman to you?
    <br>I dont know her.
    <br>OK, let's find out from her. Madam, you are welcome.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Who is this man to you?
    <br>He is my best.
    <br>It's a lie. I'm a pastor.
    <br>My husband - he is my best.
    <br>Tell her to go and look for her best. I'm not her best.
    <br>Madam, did you hear that?
    <br>Reverend Uche Ekeoma is my husband. We got married in 1990.
    <br>I wedded in 1978.
    <br>What is happening to her? What have you done so far to this marriage?
    <br>Sickness - she will suffer sickness very well in her life.
    <br>My name is Bianca, queen of the coast.
    <br>Every day, I stay with him, I always hear at night, "Bianca!"
    <br>He would be laughing and swimming on the bed.
    <br>Then I would wake up, put the light on, sit down
    <br>and ask him, "What is this? Who is this Bianca?" He would get annoyed with me.
    <br>The next thing he would do, if it was very early in the morning,
    <br>he would not take his bath; he would put on his clothes and go away.
    <br>For one year, I would not see him; I would look for him until I got him.
    <br>I have suffered.
    <br>Watch me and watch her. Who is more beautiful?
    <br>This is a man. Can a man be beautiful?
    <br>I am a woman, not a man.
    <br>Just look at me and this thing here. Then tell me who is more beautiful.
    <br>We wanted to come. I had been planning for this deliverance.
    <br>That morning, my elder sister gave me some money.
    <br>Other people and church members gave me up to 50,000 naira.
    <br>I then found myself in the hospital. My blood pressure was 300 --
    <br>I caused it.
    <br>I even took that money away. I just had mercy and she managed to go to hospital.
    <br>In that hospital, I should have killed her there.
    <br>You said that this man is a pastor; he preaches and calls the name Jesus.
    <br>How do you normally hide?
    <br>Sometimes, when I came to make love to him,
    <br>he would tell me, I am reading the Bible and praying.
    <br>This man could pray before but gradually, I swept everything out from him.
    <br>He cannot even pray well.
    <br>He cannot pray. Every night, I would quarrel with him.
    <br>Every morning, I would quarrel with him.
    <br>When I bring out my Bible to read, he would read and teach me what is in the Bible.
    <br>He would say, "Let me go and urinate".
    <br>Can a woman teach a woman the Bible?
    <br>Is it not a man that would teach a woman the Bible?
    <br>Ask her! Is it not a man, a pastor that would teach the members,
    <br>not a member to teach the pastor? Then why is she coming to me?
    <br>I am dragging one thing with her since she feels that I can teach her the Bible.
    <br>I cannot teach her the Bible because this man himself, he would throw the Bible away.
    <br>Right now, you demon, you can no longer hide.
    <br>I told you that I am a gentle spirit.
    <br>Don't release this fire because all your hand is fire, fire, fire!
    <br>As you are standing here - fire, fire, fire - and it is burning so high!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out of him! Out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' name. Amen.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Rise up! You are delivered.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, sir?
    <br>I'm fine, sir.
    <br>Ah! Why am I here?
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>But I wore a coat.
    <br>You wore what?
    <br>I wore a coat.
    <br>Who removed it?
    <br>She removed it.
    <br>Who is she?
    <br>She is my best.
    <br>Good.
    <br>Are you a man or a woman?
    <br>I am a man. A full fledged man.
    <br>Good.
    <br>Look around.
    <br>Whose cloth is this?
    <br>It is my coat.
    <br>Who removed it?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>Put it on. It is yours.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>How are you now, sir?
    <br>Sir, I am very free; I am happy now.
    <br>You said that you are the queen of the coast.
    <br>And you titled your name, 'Bianca'.
    <br>I am Reverend Ekeoma Uche. I am not a woman.
    <br>And many other things you said you have done.
    <br>You have destroyed yourself, your ministry and your marriage.
    <br>That demon that spoke through you is out!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>So Madam, you should not use it against him,
    <br>just as you should not use what she has said against her.
    <br>Both of you are completely delivered by Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Pastor Ekoma Uche from Abia State, Nigeria.
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my best - Prophetess Omoze Uche.
    <br>I was born into a Christian family but my grandfather was a native doctor.
    <br>When I was born, my mother told me that I was very sick; we were twins.
    <br>Because of my sickness, they decided to take me here and there to find a way to rescue my life.
    <br>At the last place that they went to, the native doctor told them to throw me inside the river
    <br>and expect to receive me back, which they did.
    <br>After three days, as my mother told me, they came to the river bank,
    <br>picked me up and I became well.
    <br>As I was growing up, something began to manifest in my life,
    <br>telling me that I could not make it until I recognised I came from somewhere".
    <br>Then, the next thing I did was to become a born-again Christian but the spirit was still in me.
    <br>So, I decided to enter Bible School even though the spirit was still operating in me.
    <br>Then, one day, I came to Lagos because it was the time of my graduation.
    <br>As I was returning to Aba, in the park, I saw a lady.
    <br>She just rushed to me with her car and said she wanted to join me in this journey.
    <br>I said that there was no problem since there was a vacant seat available.
    <br>We started the journey. On the road, she bought so many things.
    <br>It was on the trip, as we were seated that she then told me
    <br>she wanted to introduce herself to me and I agreed.
    <br>She introduced herself as Bianca and said she wanted to be my wife.
    <br>I said, "Okay".
    <br>While on the journey, she bought me a necklace, wristwatch and a ring.
    <br>When we got to Aba and I was about to go to my house,
    <br>she insisted that she would like to pass the night with me and we slept together.
    <br>As we were sleeping, something tapped me and I woke up.
    <br>I looked at her, and she began to change colour.
    <br>I wanted to scream but she woke up and asked me what was happening.
    <br>I became afraid.
    <br>Then she said, as long as I had slept with her, she had initiated me
    <br>and we entered into a covenant.
    <br>You mean she changed to what? Was it at midnight?
    <br>It was at midnight.
    <br>Were the lights off?
    <br>The lights were switched off but something tapped me and I awoke.
    <br>I turned on the light and saw her---
    <br>Change to what? Tell us.
    <br>Her legs were in the form of a fish while her upper body was that of a human being.
    <br>I wanted to scream, and she changed automatically
    <br>because she knew somebody would come in.
    <br>Okay, question again. The house was your own house or a rented house?
    <br>We slept in a hotel.
    <br>So you paid for the hotel?
    <br>She paid the money.
    <br>She paid the money?
    <br>Yes, because I did not have the money to pay for the hotel.
    <br>Okay, who located that hotel?
    <br>She located the hotel, although she asked me if I knew any hotel there.
    <br>I said, "No".
    <br>Then, you were a pastor?
    <br>Yes, I was a student pastor then.
    <br>Okay, in theology school?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>After then, my life changed.
    <br>One thing she told me to be in the covenant was that I would never have another wife.
    <br>I said, "Okay".
    <br>She told me that anytime I married, I would surely face the repercussions.
    <br>This lady gave me a talent such that I didn't even know what I was doing.
    <br>I did not go to secondary school; I just passed Primary Six.
    <br>However, I teach in secondary school as if I have graduated from university.
    <br>The subjects I was teaching in secondary school were government, geography, CRK
    <br>and the Igbo language.
    <br>She used to teach me at night.
    <br>The lady?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Without attending any school?
    <br>Without attending any school - she physically came to me
    <br>during my time of study and taught me those subjects.
    <br>God is looking for character, not gifts.
    <br>What do you understand about that?
    <br>Gifted people are more among the children of satan than the children of God.
    <br>Gifted are more among the children of satan than even the children of God.
    <br>He is looking for character, not gifts.
    <br>God's Word reflects His character.
    <br>You can be gifted without character.
    <br>But you cannot have a good character without a gift.
    <br>There is what we call supernatural gift and natural gift - talent.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>Although I was a pastor, I was also a teacher.
    <br>She used to come and teach me; then I would teach the students.
    <br>Nobody in Aba does not know me as a teacher and also a pastor.
    <br>I teach students very well.
    <br>They loved me but they did not know that something was behind the lessons.
    <br>During the examination periods; that is, WAEC time,
    <br>I registered them, took them to the examination centres and we wrote.
    <br>On the day of writing the exams, if you did not agree with me, you would suffer in the hall.
    <br>After which I would grade them, I would make love with them,
    <br>play with them and initiate them.
    <br>When the results would come out, those who did not accept my offer,
    <br>or those who did not agree to give me what I required or needed from them,
    <br>their results would surely be seized.
    <br>Some people accused the government for seizing the exams.
    <br>Are you the one that seized their results?
    <br>Spiritually.
    <br>Their results would be seized spiritually.
    <br>If you settled us, we would ask you to go to the internet,
    <br>make your mark and then you could get your results.
    <br>When you got your results, you would find it very difficult to get admission to university.
    <br>Even if you got admission, it would be a fake result because it was from the spiritual world.
    <br>Remember that I told you that I was a 'Christian' and a pastor at the same time.
    <br>I was using all these things as a cover up.
    <br>It is not all results that the government seizes; some are seized by demons,
    <br>which is the simplest way to initiate them when they come back to us.
    <br>Can I ask you a question? If a student is a Christian,
    <br>coming as a student to your school or sitting the WAEC exams -
    <br>because they are not all your students, some students come from outside -
    <br>and they are Christians, what would you do with that?
    <br>If you are a Christian and I took you to the examination centre,
    <br>you are not my problem because if I dare come near you,
    <br>the fire around you will surely scare us away.
    <br>The question now: How many students are Christians today?
    <br>Every 10 students, two; and every 20 students, four.
    <br>Can your children be among these just two?
    <br>Every 10 students, two are fire.
    <br>The rest can be captured.
    <br>I know if I give you a chance today, some of our 'mummy' and 'daddy',
    <br>they will come and swear Heaven and earth that their children are eating with Jesus.
    <br>What you don't know, your children know better than you.
    <br>You don't need to send them to school; the internet has taught them everything.
    <br>They will just sit at home and be looking at you.
    <br>Sometimes, when you are battling with the television at home,
    <br>to switch it on with the remote, they will be looking at you.
    <br>After you have suffered so much, they will say, "Mummy, don't worry".
    <br>At the beginning, they would not want you to know that they know these things.
    <br>They will allow you to battle with the television or laptop.
    <br>After you have battled, they will say, "Mummy, don't worry. I know what is happening to it".
    <br>Because they don't want you to suspect that they are more advanced than you.
    <br>You will be using a handset, you will have loaded it with credit - full.
    <br>Your own children will not one day buy credit.
    <br>They will be deducting your credit; they will be using it.
    <br>You keep buying credit, and they are the ones using it.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You will continue to load your handset with credit everyday
    <br>because you do not know anything - you are a zombie.
    <br>You don't know anything because you are too busy with your job.
    <br>There is a level you can go.
    <br>You continue to load your handset with credit.
    <br>You buy a card, and there is nothing left.
    <br>But your children at home, they will not one day buy credit.
    <br>They will be deducting.
    <br>When they know that you are shouting, they will stop it for a short time.
    <br>When you say, "Ah, what is happening to MTN? Why are they cutting my credit?
    <br>They keep on eating my credit!"
    <br>You don't know that your children at home are the ones eating your credit.
    <br>At that time, I had a secret room; I had not yet married then.
    <br>When pastors had their meetings, I would not go out that day.
    <br>Nothing would move me to go out of my room
    <br>because it would be the day we would meet in the spiritual world.
    <br>I would lock myself up in the room turn into a cat.
    <br>I would lock the room from the inside so that nobody could open it.
    <br>If I forgot to lock the room and you came inside, whatever you saw,
    <br>whatever happened to you would be your fault.
    <br>I would go to the spiritual world to have meetings.
    <br>If somebody opened that door and saw me, they would surely be initiated.
    <br>I was also a pastor then
    <br>Before I met my wife, this spiritual wife gave me two powers:
    <br>whatever I spoke would happen and in my eyes, I had a seduction spirit.
    <br>Whether you are married or not, if I liked you, I would get you,
    <br>no matter where you run to.
    <br>That is, those who are not Christians because we do not have anything to do with Christians.
    <br>When I saw my wife, I thought she was the kind of person I wanted to marry.
    <br>I looked at her and as our eyes met, I seduced her because at that time,
    <br>she was about to marry somebody else.
    <br>Since that person had not officially married her, I claimed her to be my wife.
    <br>Though she hated me at that time, she began to have an interest in me
    <br>and whatever I asked her to do, she did.
    <br>There was a day I went to my elder brother who had money.
    <br>I asked him to give me sixty naira to get a passport
    <br>because there was a job I wanted to secure.
    <br>He brought out a bunch of money and showed it to me and said,
    <br>"You are my brother, go and look for your own money".
    <br>I said, "No problem" and left him.
    <br>Since that time till now, my elder brother is now doing a petty business in a local market.
    <br>He is nothing to write home about.
    <br>Last week, I was delivered.
    <br>So, since the beginning of your life, that evil spirit has been tormenting you?
    <br>It tormented me but I clothed myself with 'Christianity'
    <br>and with the name 'pastor' but nobody knew.
    <br>If I came to your church or if I was preaching,
    <br>you must surely come out when I call an altar call because they saw me as a pastor.
    <br>So you preach very well?
    <br>I preach very well, sir.
    <br>My wife is a prophetess.
    <br>She is a prophetess indeed but the other way round.
    <br>We started having disagreements and quarrels.
    <br>My spiritual wife did not allow her to have peace of mind.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Speak out! Who are you?
    <br>We are three.
    <br>Mention yourselves.
    <br>Idol from the mother's house, spiritual husband, and she is a queen.
    <br>How do you operate in this body?
    <br>We gave her anger and barrenness.
    <br>Any time she was pregnant, we would come as a nurse.
    <br>She would deliver into our hands and we would leave with the child.
    <br>She used to go to spiritual doctors and thought she was going for protection.
    <br>Look at it here.
    <br>What is that?
    <br>We entered through this place.
    <br>Touch the place.
    <br>Look at it.
    <br>Look at the flowers here; we entered through there.
    <br>I wanted to kill her in the late 80's.
    <br>The first man who wanted to marry her - we gave her a drug addict and seller.
    <br>She refused.
    <br>They took her to a place where they told her that if she married a pastor,
    <br>she would suffer and not give birth to a child.
    <br>She became pregnant and we took another one, that was in 2001, when she had a son.
    <br>The other three boys, four in all, we took them all.
    <br>She is crying every minute of the day.
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>She is a prophetess. I have finished everything about her career.
    <br>I closed the church down.
    <br>What have you done to her husband?
    <br>Does she have a husband?
    <br>OK, let's find out because we are seeing a man standing next to her.
    <br>You are welcome, sir.
    <br>Who is this woman to you?
    <br>She is my married wife; I married her as tradition demands.
    <br>OK, let's find out. Who is this man to you?
    <br>This man here is a snatcher. He snatched my wife from me.
    <br>Are you a snatcher, sir?
    <br>I am not a snatcher.
    <br>What have you done to this man?
    <br>I pushed him to women.
    <br>He would be going from one woman to another.
    <br>This idiot would cry.
    <br>She would call him on the phone but he would not answer her.
    <br>When she cries, we are happy. We would be teasing her.
    <br>Sir, did you listen to what she said?
    <br>I heard her.
    <br>What can you say about what she said?
    <br>The life she lives as a pastor, I am always ashamed to walk with her on the road.
    <br>She smokes.
    <br>In fact, I am enduring because I love her.
    <br>She said she is a pastoress, a prophetess. Are you confirming this to be true?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What about you? Who are you, sir?
    <br>I am also a pastor, a minister.
    <br>I gave her cigarettes in the dream and she smoked when she was young -
    <br>about 13 years old.
    <br>The day I found out that she liked cigarettes, I was shocked.
    <br>She said she could not do without cigarettes.
    <br>She started smoking when she was in Primary Six.
    <br>What else have you done to this woman?
    <br>Sickness - I gave her hypertension, diabetes and waist pain.
    <br>I gave her serious headaches and general body pain - from head to toe.
    <br>What can you say about it?
    <br>It is true. She can never sleep without drugs.
    <br>Right now, you contrary spirit, this body belongs to Jesus. Get out!
    <br>Come out of this body!
    <br>Out!
    <br>All over your body, Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Come out of her!
    <br>Every part of your body!
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for her deliverance.
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Rise up. You are delivered.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, Madam?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>You said that you possessed a contrary spirit that destroyed your marriage life,
    <br>gave you the spirit of smoking and also destroyed your career.
    <br>I have been crying.
    <br>People said that I was a good woman.
    <br>But I didn't see anything good in me because I used to smoke.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Right now, how do you feel within you after the deliverance?
    <br>I am okay.
    <br>Who is this man to you?
    <br>He is my best.
    <br>Is he not a snatcher?
    <br>He is my best.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Her past is over. She is delivered.
    <br>Don't use it against her. Otherwise you too will be tempted.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My name is Prophetess Mrs Omoze Uche.
    <br>Ah, Prophetess?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>We come from Aba (Nigeria).
    <br>It all started when I was living with my grandmother
    <br>and she told me anything I ate in the dream, I should try and eat it physically.
    <br>When I was younger, I smoked in my dreams.
    <br>When I woke up, I went to a store where they sold cigarettes.
    <br>The people in the shop asked me who had sent me to buy the cigarettes.
    <br>I told them that it was my elder brother.
    <br>They asked me the name of the cigarettes.
    <br>I told them that I didn't know but pointed at them
    <br>because they were the ones I smoked in my dreams.
    <br>You have been smoking for how many years now?
    <br>It has been about 25 years. I smoked a packet of cigarettes every day.
    <br>After your deliverance?
    <br>Since Sunday, I have no urge to smoke.
    <br>I don't even remember smoking.
    <br>Rise up! She said she doesn't even remember, talkless of smoking.
    <br>Do you know that this is the problem of the whole world?
    <br>If I am talking, let me see your hand.
    <br>Do you know that this is the problem of the whole world?
    <br>50% of people in the world are addicted to smoking.
    <br>And after smoking, they can do anything, they can commit suicide.
    <br>She said that after the deliverance, she does not even remember, talkless thinking of the urge.
    <br>She does not even remember that she was smoking before.
    <br>Just like that.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, did you listen to that?
    <br>If you are a smoker, just come for deliverance.
    <br>Jesus will deliver you.
    <br>Thank you. You may be seated.
    <br>So enough is enough. Satan has no room again in your life.
    <br>I did a lot of things in this life, in the name of Christianity.
    <br>My advice to people, particularly pastors and parents:
    <br>Look and know who is who in your church
    <br>because there are pastors who claim to be pastors but they are not.
    <br>Please, whatever you are doing in this life,
    <br>make sure you are not a goat in sheep's clothing.
    <br>Thank you. Let's hear from the woman.
    <br>I thank God today for the man of God and the wise men
    <br>who He used to deliver me and my husband.
    <br>There is an instruction now from God.
    <br>My brother there, I want you, with respect, remove your collar.
    <br>Let's later ask God whether you are called to the work of God.
    <br>You remove your collar.
    <br>I would like you to personally address yourselves as Mr and your wife as Mrs now to the whole world.
    <br>Later, after the service, we will come together and ask God what His direction is.
    <br>You have given pain to your own kingdom, not the Kingdom of God.
    <br>We are free moral agents. You can choose not to submit to satan.
    <br>And you can choose not to submit today.
    <br>You submitted to satan, and satan used you mightly
    <br>because we remember when you said a woman entered the vehicle
    <br>and you people entered and she carried you to a hotel; it was somebody you didn't know.
    <br>If she had used you for a ritual at the hotel, definitely, nobody would have known.
    <br>I will not leave you unless God gives us the direction you should follow,
    <br>to really show that you regret the way satan used you.
    <br>Now, I am telling the whole world that our names are Mr and Mrs Ekeoma Uche,
    <br>not Pastor and Prophetess Uche Ekeoma.
    <br>I will pray with you to ask God the direction for your life -
    <br>whether God wants you to be an engineer or go back to do the work of teaching
    <br>or lawyer or whatever. We can now ask God.
    <br>Or if it is the work of God, God wants you to do, you will now begin to...
    <br>Not that name you bore before now. Okay?
    <br>I apologise to the world for the name I was moving with as a pastor.
    <br>Now I believe that God will grant me the grace, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can we hear from your wife?
    <br>My name now is Mrs Omoze Uche Ekeoma, not Prophetess Okeoma Uche.
    <br>I apologise to the world.
    <br>Let the will of God, through the man of God, be done in our lives.
    <br>Thank you. Rise up and give thanks to God.
    <br>Just bow down your head
    <br>and let's come together and pray to God to show His mercy upon humankind.
    <br>Bow down your head and ask God for His mercy and favour
    <br>and that He should continue to show His mercy.
    <br>His mercy and favour will never end.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
