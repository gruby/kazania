  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>it is time to talk to your body;
    <br>it is time to talk to your soul and spirit.
    <br>Your body, listen: Every organ that is not functioning in your system,
    <br>in your faculties, right now by the blood of Jesus and the power of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>Holy Ghost,
    <br>in the name of Jesus, begin to function!
    <br>My kidney, begin to function!
    <br>My liver, begin to function!
    <br>My blood, begin to function!
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Those of us who are under the influence of this voice,
    <br>I declare that spirit that is not of God - wanted!
    <br>You evil spirit, vacate!
    <br>I say vacate!
    <br>Their body is not your temple.
    <br>Right now, begin to vacate!
    <br>Begin to quit!
    <br>I say quit!
    <br>I command you wanted!
    <br>I command you out! I say out!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>The will of God be done.
    <br>Every will that is not the will of God - out!
    <br>Say, "Every will that is not of God - out!"
    <br>Let the will of God be done!
    <br>Every will that is not of God, every will that is not of Jesus - out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Are you in a helpless situation?
    <br>Whatever situation you are in - are you in a coma or on the sickbed?
    <br>Whatever state you are in, Jesus knows better.
    <br>I command every organ - begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>By the power of the Holy Ghost, every organ - begin to function!
    <br>Every organ - begin to function, by the                                 power of the Holy Ghost!
    <br>Every organ - begin to function, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Declare, "It is well with my soul!"
    <br>Declare, "It is well with my spirit!"
    <br>Declare, "It is well with my body!"
    <br>Declare, "It is well with my career!"
    <br>Declare, "It is well with my home!"
    <br>It is well, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Give thanks to God.
