  <p>    
    <br>Let's listen to the broken home and reconciliation.
    <br>As you listen to this confession,
    <br>our response to a person who makes mistakes can also be a mistake.
    <br>So, when you hear something - "Ha!" - you are making a mistake already.
    <br>There is no difference; you have committed sin already.
    <br>You need to forgive because you need to be forgiven.
    <br>Therefore, your response to whatever confession they want to make,
    <br>we have to be very careful.
    <br>Our response to a person who makes mistakes can also be a mistake.
    <br>My name is Keke Better.
    <br>This is Evangelist Elvis Osita, my band leader.
    <br>This is Uduarighe Gloria, my colleague.
    <br>This is Prophet Omoroja Degema.
    <br>This is Joseph Ejeh, representative of His Royal Highness.
    <br>This is Honorable Alex Izogo, representative of His Royal Highness in my community.
    <br>This is my husband, Mr Jackson Keke.
    <br>We are here because of the case of witchcraft.
    <br>There was a terrible accident that happened in my place
    <br>and it involved three people that were around me.
    <br>On the day we went for the burial of the boy who was in the music band of Evangelist Elvis Osita,
    <br>right there at the burial ground, a voice spoke to me that I should confess and I became worried.
    <br>Two weeks after that, Evangelist Elvis Osita called me and he said that
    <br>a spirit ministered to him that I should confess to him.
    <br>After some time, I began to confess to him that I'm the one who killed
    <br>the boys that died in Olomoro through an accident.
    <br>He asked me about my dreams.
    <br>I told him most of the dreams and he changed them to become witchcraft.
    <br>After some time, he called me again and said a voice is telling him that
    <br>I'm not through; that I should still confess to him.
    <br>Right there, I began to hear a strange voice talking to me.
    <br>Then I began to confess that I wanted to kill his wife, I'm the one responsible
    <br>for my husband's loss of job and I wanted to kill his three children.
    <br>I also mentioned the names of some people who are into witchcraft which resulted in problems.
    <br>When I discovered these problems, I decided I should go to my pastor
    <br>who said I should come to Warri, our headquarters, for deliverance.
    <br>I went there. I made my confession and they did deliverance for me.
    <br>After the deliverance, I kept hearing the voice and this is the cassette
    <br>of my deliverance in Warri.
    <br>Can we see the cassette?
    <br>I killed my school tailor through an accident.
    <br>The evil spirit used me to work.
    <br>I have a spiritual mother, spiritual father and spiritual friend.
    <br>This evil spirit has used me to destroy my husband totally.
    <br>I used the evil spirit to destroy the cassette of my band leader so that
    <br>it will not be successful.
    <br>I married the devil spiritually.
    <br>I have used this evil spirit to destroy myself and destroy other people.
    <br>I change into a snake and a shadow.
    <br>I even work through breeze.
    <br>That evil spirit is an international spirit.
    <br>I used the evil spirit to tie my band leader's wife for her not to give birth successfully.
    <br>She did not do anything to me but because she was close to me,
    <br>the evil spirit hated her.
    <br>I used this evil spirit to frustrate churches and to confuse pastors
    <br>so that they will talk without sense.
    <br>Speak!
    <br>The evil spirit wanted to kill my husband so I initiated my husband
    <br>but he is strong - that is why I cannot kill him.
    <br>Anywhere my husband goes for solution, they always tell him that his death is in my hand.
    <br>I used the evil spirit to kill one of my students in school.
    <br>I entered the child and the evil spirit chased her into an accident.
    <br>It was so serious that the child died.
    <br>When people gathered to mourn the death of the child, I was just pretending.
    <br>In the accident, three people died and their blood cried against me.
    <br>Let me just tell you about yourself.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Before we talk about witches or wizards or whatever...
    <br>When you look at your genesis, your family,
    <br>you have the traces of mental disorder there.
    <br>Circle of life - mental disorder, brain problem.
    <br>Can you tell me, in your family, who has a mental disorder?
    <br>The way I've been speaking like this, one of my aunts spoke like that years ago.
    <br>- My sister is here.
    <br>- Please, come.
    <br>Can you tell me; in your family, there are people that have a brain problem, mental problem.
    <br>Not necessarily "naked", but you can see that this person...
    <br>Yes, one of my aunts had that kind of problem when we were small.
    <br>A mental problem.
    <br>This Lady Actually CONFESSED To Being A WITCH...ðŸ˜§
    <br>The spirit that is speaking to her is not that spirit of witches or wizards.
    <br>It is a brain problem.
    <br>She is not a witch, she is not anything, but she has...
    <br>You will see that you have a chronic headache.
    <br>When this headache comes, your eyes will be bringing water.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This Lady Actually CONFESSED To Being A WITCH...ðŸ˜§
    <br>Now, come to this our brother here.
    <br>She was saying something that you said to her that your spirit told you she had something to confess.
    <br>- Is that true?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>My name is Evangelist Elvis Osita.
    <br>The accident that happened - people were saying that I used boys that died
    <br>so that my ministry can grow.
    <br>So, I went for fasting for 30 days.
    <br>- You went for fasting?
    <br>- On my own, in my house.
    <br>During the fasting, I saw her and this was how it was revealed to me.
    <br>I called her telling her what was revealed to me.
    <br>- You saw her in the dream, in the vision?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Tell us what you saw her doing in the vision.
    <br>When I saw her, she was lusting after a man and I was asking her,
    <br>"Why are you lusting after this man?"
    <br>She said that the man was a musician and the man would teach her a lot of songs.
    <br>I said, "You have been following me for fourteen years.
    <br>Which song can this man teach you that I cannot teach you?"
    <br>She hardly left the man.
    <br>When I woke up in the morning, I called her and said,
    <br>"This is what I saw today. Are you leaving your marriage? Are you running after somebody?"
    <br>Because that was my understanding.
    <br>She said, "No", she is not running after anybody.
    <br>Come.
    <br>You are not a wizard.
    <br>You are just a plain man like any other person here.
    <br>There is nothing like "evil" inside you
    <br>but you are using information as a spiritual thing.
    <br>What you are saying is purely information, not spiritual.
    <br>There is a difference between human and divine.
    <br>What you are saying, what you are working on and the dream you have -
    <br>you need an interpretation for that dream.
    <br>This Lady Actually CONFESSED To Being A WITCH...ðŸ˜§
    <br>He is a good man.
    <br>There is nothing evil in him.
    <br>But it is just information - it is mere feeling.
    <br>Feelings are influenced by what we hear.
    <br>Feelings are influenced by what we read.
    <br>Feelings are influenced by what we see.
    <br>It's mere feeling.
    <br>When we allow our feelings to control our faith,
    <br>we can be a Christian but controlled by satanic devices.
    <br>This Lady Actually CONFESSED To Being A WITCH...ðŸ˜§
    <br>He is a good man!
    <br>Whatever name they call him, God should forgive them.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Let me just get you out of this what is making noise in your ear.
    <br>This Lady Actually CONFESSED To Being A WITCH...ðŸ˜§
    <br>So, I don't need to ask anything from anybody
    <br>because what you people came here today for is baseless.
    <br>She is not a witch, he is not a wizard - it is mere feeling and mental problem in this family.
    <br>My name is Gloria Uduarighe.
    <br>She called me a witch and this has affected my business.
    <br>- She called you a witch?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>How?
    <br>I gave a testimony in church and because of the testimony, she said I'm a witch.
    <br>- This lady called you a witch?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>The two of you should come here.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Imagine somebody standing in the public, while a boy who died from accident is being buried,
    <br>saying, she is the one who killed that boy.
    <br>If you call anybody witch, they will just believe.
    <br>And the lady who is talking is not even a witch.
    <br>How this person can be a witch, if the person who called her that is not a witch?
    <br>Can you see the confusion?
    <br>OK, let's hear from the lady.
    <br>This thing has affected my business.
    <br>I have a school and parents have withdrawn all the children from the school.
    <br>Everybody disappeared from the school?
    <br>Everybody, because they said I was a witch.
    <br>They say you are a witch?
    <br>So with that, they withdrew all the children from the school.
    <br>You have listened to that.
    <br>Madam, let the whole world see; can man of God stand with a witch?
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>She is not a witch - you are not a witch.
    <br>Sorry.
    <br>We pray for those who called you witch and believed this false testimony, falsehood -
    <br>God should forgive them.
    <br>God is about to do greater things in your life.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Don't worry. Come.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>- Which State is that?
    <br>- Delta State.
    <br>Please, my people in Delta - this lady is a good lady.
    <br>This is a lady who says she is a witch - she is not a witch.
    <br>OK, can you hug yourselves please?
    <br>This Lady Actually CONFESSED To Being A WITCH...ðŸ˜§
    <br>My name is Honorable Alex Izogo.
    <br>I and my friend Joseph Ejeh were sent by the King of Olomoro community.
    <br>The two of us were sent here because of what happened.
    <br>Man of God, we thank you because this trouble has torn our community apart.
    <br>Everybody is watching us.
    <br>Even as we are standing here, they are calling us.
    <br>What you just said now, sir, is the final solution to the problem.
    <br>This Lady Actually CONFESSED To Being A WITCH...ðŸ˜§
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>After this family had been reconciled in Christ Jesus,
    <br>after the reconciliation which had taken place earlier that day,
    <br>this family were keen to share the painful experiences they had passed through
    <br>and how they appreciate the vindication God Almighty has wrought in their lives
    <br>through His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>To God be the glory, we have come to the presence of the powerful man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, who indicated that I'm not a witch, which makes me joyful.
    <br>The moment he prayed for me and I fell down,
    <br>I felt that my brain was 're-shifted' and I became normal.
    <br>Finally, God has ended everything; I'm not a witch and I believe that
    <br>every other person whose name was mentioned is not a witch either.
    <br>Today, I'm very happy because the problem that brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>was the problem of being accused of being a witch.
    <br>My friend beside me was under a curse and that had affected her brain,
    <br>according to the man of God today and because of the influence of the curse,
    <br>she said I was a witch which caused a lot of problems in our community.
    <br>But today, I thank God that God has restored me.
    <br>I thank God that Prophet T.B. Joshua has declared to the whole world that I'm not a witch.
    <br>We are very happy. As for me, I am very glad.
    <br>I'm going home happily, joyfully that I have been liberated
    <br>because I know I am leaving this place to a higher post and that is my joy.
    <br>I thank God for the life of His servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Today is one of the happiest days in my life.
    <br>I am happy that I have been vindicated - that there is nothing like that.
    <br>Today, the man of God has said that all she said was due to a mental disorder.
    <br>That she is not a witch. So, all the wrong I have said about her, I'm sorry.
    <br>Demonstrating that the gospel of God's grace has destroyed all the hostilities
    <br>that had once divided this family,
    <br>they embrace and worship God together,
    <br>rejoicing in the peace and joy of the Lord.
    <br>As the Bible says, the right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>Seeing it as a real privilege to be in the position to give,
    <br>the next day, when the families were about to make their way home,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua blessed them with the sum of â‚¦160,000 to pay for their transport costs.
