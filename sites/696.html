    <br>Wise Man Racine, under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit, ministers prayer to Mrs Argiro Sakka.
    <br>Immediately, she falls to the ground under the healing influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>You can see her shaking against her will
    <br>as Jesus Christ is at work repairing and restoring her womb.
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>A few months later, Mrs Argiro Sakka came back to The Scoan with her husband,
    <br>all the way from Greece, to share her testimony. Let's listen to her!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Mrs Argiro Sakka
    <br>Greece.
    <br>I am 34 years old.
    <br>This is my husband.
    <br>My name is Argiro Sakka, I come from Greece. I am 34 years old and this is my husband.
    <br>During my pregnancy, I was bleeding and the water broke two years ago,
    <br>so the doctors had to totally remove my womb and my menstruation stopped.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>These are my medical reports that show that my womb was removed.
    <br>I had no menstruation.
    <br>I lost all hope that my menstruation could come back.
    <br>June 11th, 2010 I came to The SCOAN and Wise Man Racine prayed for me
    <br>and on August 13th, 2010 I had my menstruation for the first time in one year.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Three months after I received prayer, I went to the hospital
    <br>for examinations and the first part of my womb started showing.
    <br>Since then, my womb continued growing gradually
    <br>and now it has been recreated completely.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>That is, after the operation, the womb was removed.
    <br>The doctor confirmed, the womb was removed.
    <br>Now, since the womb had been removed, no menstruation,
    <br>and there is no way she could have menstruation.
    <br>But last year she came here and she had not been having her menstruation for a long time
    <br>because the womb was removed.
    <br>She was prayed for and look at - and after that prayer, the womb was returned spiritually by operation.
    <br>Now, she went to see the doctor,
    <br>and the doctor said, "You see your menstruation? How come when there is no womb?"
    <br>Then the doctor tested her and said,
    <br>"Ah, I removed the womb. How come the womb has come back?"
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>As for me, I don't think any miracle is better than that
    <br>because the womb was removed, the doctor confirmed it and the x-ray is there to confirm it.
    <br>The menstruation she had not been seeing for many years because the womb was removed -
    <br>she started seeing her menstruation.
    <br>After she dreamt that the womb had returned, she went to the doctor.
    <br>The doctor did a lot of tests, and the womb was returned.
    <br>Now, look at her here with the medical report and everything.
    <br>What is your problem?
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>That was last year.
    <br>Today, the Lord promised to give us a birthday gift -
    <br>freedom from that thing that has been disturbing you.
    <br>We have a medical doctor here.
    <br>What can you say about the womb removal, sir.
    <br>I would say that it is actually impossible that when a womb is removed
    <br>for it to ever regenerate.
    <br>So, this is just an act of God to have a new womb come back.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Dr Vincent Nwosa, Md
    <br>The Bahamas, USA
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>So you listened to what the doctor said. He said, act of God.
    <br>He cannot say more than that because it is humanly impossible.
    <br>This can only happen by God.
    <br>Invisible President!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Invisible President!"
    <br>Invisible President!
    <br>He is the President of the invisible world.
    <br>Whatever we are doing here, we know that it is only an extension.
    <br>All what we are saying now, our meeting here,
    <br>it has happened before we have it here.
    <br>Everything we are doing is an extension.
    <br>The bank is over there.
    <br>When a miracle happens here, it has happened over there.
    <br>Before it happens here, it has happened over there.
    <br>Before we shout hallelujah, they have shouted over there.
    <br>This testimony has been given over there before we give it here.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Invisible President!"
    <br>INCREDIBLE MIRACLE Even Doctors Confirmed Was IMPOSSIBLE!
    <br>Last year, I came to The SCOAN and the wise man prayed for me.
    <br>After the prayer, I went for examination and
    <br>I saw that my womb had been completely recreated.
    <br>My menstruation came back
    <br>and the doctor said I would be able to have a child.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Listen to that! Do you see the word the doctor used - recreated?
    <br>He agrees that it grows.
    <br>It's like you have a sore, and the face of the sore is so deep.
    <br>Suddenly, it grows - body can grow.
    <br>You know I used to say to you that there are spare parts of your body in the store.
    <br>If anyone is harmed, if anyone is injured,
    <br>go to the store, take it and just fix it.
    <br>Everybody has extra!
    <br>Your health - extra health is in the store.
    <br>In case your head hits something, they will open the store, give you another one, and remove this one.
    <br>We have spare parts.
    <br>When an area of your car is damaged,
    <br>you go to the market to buy a new part.
    <br>They would fix and remove the damaged part. The same thing applies to all parts of your body.
    <br>On the last day, by the time many of us will stand there,
    <br>God would just open the store and say, "Look - everything of your body.
    <br>Look at the spare parts! Look at this one that was hurt!
    <br>Instead of calling on me to let me open the store and give it to you, now see yourself!"
    <br>It's a womb.
    <br>If they removed your womb, and God created you,
    <br>it can be regenerated, it can be recreated.
    <br>It can regrow.
    <br>This is exactly what happened to the sister. It grew back.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We have listened to the wonderful testimony from Mrs Argiro Sakka with her husband.
    <br>They came all the way from Greece.
    <br>Wow!
    <br>I am happy because it really touched your faith.
    <br>It really struck that spirit in you.
    <br>It happened!
    <br>Nothing is impossible with His power.
