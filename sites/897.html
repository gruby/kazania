  <p>    
    <br>You’re possessed.
    <br>You have one kind of spirit – water spirit.
    <br>A lot.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Take him up.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus’ Name
    <br>A woman is disturbing you in the spirit.
    <br>A lot.
    <br>You have married a lot of women in the spirit.
    <br>Every day, I am tormented by these spirits.
    <br>I don’t sleep at night.
    <br>Help me, Man of God.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus’ Name
    <br>This is not yet confirmed.
    <br>Because you have come all the way long with long chains – chains of women.
    <br>Yes, it’s true, Man of God.
    <br>How many women before this woman?
    <br>More than six or seven.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus’ Name
    <br>He is free!
    <br>He will tell you more.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Jabulani Buthelezi.
    <br>I'm a South African.
    <br>Next to me is my lovely wife, Mrs Buthelezi.
    <br>I am standing here because of the prophecy the man of God gave.
    <br>He told me that I was possessed by marine spirits.
    <br>I am with the woman next to me but I have not slept with her for the past four years
    <br>because I had pain in my manhood that would not allow me to touch her.
    <br>Why was all that?
    <br>It was because of what I did in the past.
    <br>When we started our government in 1995, a number of people craved for power.
    <br>I was among those people who wanted to have power but I did not know how to get it.
    <br>My family were people who had nothing to do with God.
    <br>My family naturally, were customary as you can detect from my surname, Buthelezi.
    <br>We believe so much in customs and very little in the Word of God.
    <br>As we grew up, we were all hooked on things of tradition.
    <br>The power I needed, I had to ask my auntie who advised me that for me to be like those
    <br>who were already in power in government, already ministers, was to appease my ancestors.
    <br>I did not know anything about the ancestors because I was still young then.
    <br>They introduced me to a man from Mozambique.
    <br>I paid this man a lot of money because I was already working.
    <br>He told me that we would undergo different stages of rituals so that I could attain power -
    <br>the power to be promoted, attain money and be famous.
    <br>It was all about fame and I never thought that in order to be famous, I should get it from God.
    <br>I did not know God.
    <br>I agreed and gave the man the money.
    <br>He told me that the first thing that had to be done was that I had to appease my fallen family members.
    <br>He asked me to buy some livestock.
    <br>I bought sheep which he slaughtered in his house.
    <br>He did not have a house.
    <br>He came from Mozambique and leased a house in Soweto where he stayed at the back of the house.
    <br>He only paid 200 rands which he did not even have.
    <br>I supported him to pay the money.
    <br>He did not even have enough food in the house.
    <br>I supplied him with food because I wanted power from the man.
    <br>He told me to buy livestock which I did.
    <br>He slaughtered them at the back of the house where he was staying in a small shack.
    <br>He took the blood of the livestock that he had shed and put it in a bath.
    <br>He also took all the insides of the livestock which were very dirty -
    <br>things that were supposed be thrown away such as the stomach of the animals
    <br>and the food in the stomach that the animals had eaten -
    <br>and put them inside a bath with the blood of the animals.
    <br>He then told me to strip and take a bath with the blood; that was exactly what I did.
    <br>The man who directed me to do those things, had no house and I was the one buying him shoes.
    <br>This was the man from whom I thought all the things I needed would come from.
    <br>Outside his house, I had parked a very big car.
    <br>At that time it was the beginning of Volvo in South Africa
    <br>and I was amongst the first people to buy a 4x4 Volvo.
    <br>That car was parked outside; here was a rich man coming to a poor man to ask for power.
    <br>After doing all those things, he took me to the graveyard the following day.
    <br>I had to leave my office – I was the Director General in Gauteng.
    <br>I had to leave my office to follow this man.
    <br>He told me to spot where my mother, father, aunties and other family members were sleeping.
    <br>I took him to the graveyards.
    <br>When we arrived at the graveyard, he took the soil from the grave and took it back home.
    <br>He bathed me with the sand from the graveyard.
    <br>He gave me snuff which is used by sangomas and told me to go back to the graveyards
    <br>and say whatever I needed on top of the graves.
    <br>He said I should take my time to sit on the graves and relax for about two hours, which I did.
    <br>I parked my car next to the graveyard and went dressed in a suit to sleep in the graveyard
    <br>during the day in full view of everybody.
    <br>I did not consider whether such a thing was embarrassing.
    <br>When you are involved in such things, nothing tells you that you are not supposed to do them.
    <br>Everything for you is 'Yes'.
    <br>I stayed in those graveyards and even slept there.
    <br>Everybody passing by would see this big man sleeping on top of the graves, trying to access power.
    <br>After a few weeks, he said that I must come to his house and he would take me to a bush.
    <br>He took me to the bush, I didn’t know that there were bushes in Soweto.
    <br>He took me to a bush – it was a very thick bush around Soweto; I didn’t know about it.
    <br>When I entered the bush, there were candles all around the area I was supposed to be in.
    <br>He had lit candles all around and told me to go into the arena and relax there for two hours,
    <br>which was what I did.
    <br>I stayed in the middle of that arena in the bush and appeased the spirit of the bush.
    <br>I finished with the spirit of the bush.
    <br>The last exercise he had to do with me was to take me to the river.
    <br>That was the spirit that was exposed.
    <br>He took me to the river and I drove him with my own car.
    <br>We went to the river.
    <br>When we arrived at the river, he said that I should take off everything.
    <br>I asked, "Everything?" and he said, "Yes, take off everything".
    <br>The river was not far from the road; everybody passing there, could see me naked
    <br>but to him, there was nothing wrong with it.
    <br>I was so ashamed because even children were looking at me.
    <br>He said that I should not worry about them.
    <br>So, I took off my trousers, suit and shirt and put them next to the river.
    <br>I remained in my underwear.
    <br>He said, "No, my brother; take off your underwear."
    <br>I started looking around to see whether people were looking at me and I took off my underwear.
    <br>I then stood in the middle of the river; the river was flowing.
    <br>Not far from me, were women who were doing their washing.
    <br>It was a small river in Soweto and the women doing their washing were watching me.
    <br>Not far from the women, were dirty animals that were thrown into that river – rotten animals
    <br>and all that water was flowing towards me but because I was craving for power and needed that power,
    <br>I had to do exactly what the man told me to do.
    <br>I stripped and when I was naked, he took scissors and started making incisions on me.
    <br>He made incisions all over my body.
    <br>The last action he did was to make incisions on my manhood.
    <br>He made incisions on my manhood and I could see my blood flowing into that river.
    <br>I was red all over my body.
    <br>He told me to start swimming; I followed his instruction and started swimming.
    <br>I swam in the river on my own.
    <br>He gave me a 1.5 litre bottle and told me to scoop water into it, which I did.
    <br>I closed the bottle and he told me to take it home.
    <br>He also told me to drink the river water.
    <br>I drank that water because I needed power.
    <br>We went home.
    <br>When I got home, I took that bottle of water to the corner of my bedroom.
    <br>At that time, I had a woman who I wanted to get married to.
    <br>Concerning the water he gave me – he told me that every night at 12 midnight, I must get up,
    <br>pour some of the water into my bath, add more water and start swimming, which I did.
    <br>He told my sister – I have a younger sister - that while I was busy swimming in my bathroom upstairs -
    <br>he gave my sister a concoction -
    <br>my sister should move around my yard and sprinkle the concoction on it.
    <br>Now, listen to this.
    <br>When my sister was doing all these things...
    <br>He ordered my sister to do it naked – she should not wear clothes.
    <br>The advantage I had, was that I could not see my sister because I was upstairs.
    <br>I just did not want to see my sister moving around my yard naked.
    <br>When I was taking those baths at midnight, I noticed certain problems in the house.
    <br>The woman I was with at that time – the mother of my child -
    <br>we started having unnecessary quarrels we could not understand.
    <br>Little things were a problem.
    <br>Mr Jabulani Buthelezi & Wife
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>After about a month, when it was bedtime, I noticed that life was different.
    <br>When I touched my woman, it felt as if I was touching a man.
    <br>There was no affection.
    <br>I started separating myself from her and would face the other direction in bed
    <br>because I had no affection for her at that time.
    <br>But to my surprise, when I got up in the morning,
    <br>I would be very embarrassed to see a pool of sperm on my sheets.
    <br>It meant that I had made love the whole night
    <br>but the physical woman who had slept next to me, I had no feelings for her.
    <br>It continued.
    <br>Listen to this.
    <br>While I was busy doing these things at night and not having feelings for my wife,
    <br>when I was going to work in the morning, the minute I got onto the highway,
    <br>any woman I saw asking for a lift, I would stop and pick her up to take her to town.
    <br>While I was driving them to town, I would feel that my manhood was very active
    <br>but in the house, there was no activity.
    <br>Mr Jabulani Buthelezi & Wife
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>When I felt that my manhood was active, I would not be afraid to ask the woman
    <br>if before I got to work, we would pass somewhere just to have sex.
    <br>The funny thing was that she would never say, "No".
    <br>On the way to town, there are small bushes on the highway,
    <br>I would leave the highway – South African highways are very busy -
    <br>I would leave the highway and drive towards the bush.
    <br>While I was in the bush with this woman I didn’t know, within two minutes,
    <br>I would jump to the seat where she was and we would be making love.
    <br>However, I didn’t know the woman.
    <br>To make it worse, whatever I did with this woman was unprotected – no condom.
    <br>I would just do it.
    <br>Mr Jabulani Buthelezi & Wife
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>I was told before that I should also sprinkle the water of the bottle in my office, which I did.
    <br>When I arrived at my office, it would be as if I had not met a woman.
    <br>Any client who came to see me as a big shot in the office, I would just call her to my office
    <br>while my PA was sitting there.
    <br>She knew that when I was talking to somebody in my office, she couldn’t come in.
    <br>I would just call the client into my office, I can't tell you what was wrong with me,
    <br>within two minutes, I would find myself hugging the woman whom I did not know.
    <br>This would happen while I was in my office at work.
    <br>Within two minutes, I would be sleeping with that woman, in my office of government.
    <br>I would not just do it with one, two or three women.
    <br>By 5 o'clock when it was time to leave, I would have slept with at least four women inside my office.
    <br>There were a lot of meetings I conducted as the head of office with my staff.
    <br>My staff totalled more than 100.
    <br>I would leave my office upstairs and get into the lift
    <br>while my staff was waiting for me to address them on the ground floor.
    <br>They would send somebody to call me because I would be the last person to come.
    <br>When this woman came into my office, she would also be prey for sex.
    <br>If I didn't do it in my office, when I got into the lift – it was only three floors -
    <br>in the time it took to get to the meeting, I would be on top of the woman automatically.
    <br>While I was doing it in the lift, I didn't care whether somebody could press the lift button and enter.
    <br>That did not occur to me.
    <br>I would just do it while going down from the third floor.
    <br>Once I reached the ground floor, I would be dirty; I never cleaned myself.
    <br>I would just zip up my zip and start addressing the meeting of about 200 people.
    <br>One thing is sure; the Bible says that confession brings freedom.
    <br>He who experiences it knows it best.
    <br>The calibre of the person talking, without being told, you know he is not just an ordinary person.
    <br>The reason why he is going so deep to expose the devil is that he wants freedom.
    <br>It is very important that we pay attention and learn from his experience, that we may avoid similar experiences.
    <br>Remember, the devil is a person, but a person without flesh or blood.
    <br>Let's be very careful and listen attentively and pick up the lessons that concern us.
    <br>May God be with us, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Within this period, I started accessing a lot of money – tens of thousands of rands.
    <br>With that money, I bought every car you can think of in South Africa.
    <br>With that money, I attended night clubs.
    <br>With that money, I bought houses.
    <br>I had an advertising company and I did billboards with an Indian man.
    <br>He was also a man of rituals in his own culture.
    <br>When I went to his house, it would be full of smoke and he would be busy doing whatever he was doing.
    <br>Because he was a friend, I would try to make him happy and say, "Let me do the same as well".
    <br>He gave me those things and I got accustomed to doing things I did not know anything about.
    <br>What later happened after having injected a lot of money into that business -
    <br>I left him with the entire business, with all the money.
    <br>I even went to the bank to give him permission to transact on the accounts on his own.
    <br>I removed my name so that he could access cheques.
    <br>That was the spirit he gave me – the spirit of blindness.
    <br>In time, I met a woman.
    <br>I did not attend church, never.
    <br>I did not even want to see the door of a church.
    <br>When I was initiated with the spirit of lust, I started craving for women all over.
    <br>Because I had made a covenant of blood in the river,
    <br>people of God, I did not enjoy anything sexually without seeing blood.
    <br>I mostly enjoyed women who were menstruating.
    <br>At that level, I would feel great within me.
    <br>This spirit would lead you to do disgusting things.
    <br>In other words, you are telling us that you did horrible things, through the influence of these demons,
    <br>as a result of the initiation you underwent by the river side.
    <br>Correct, sir.
    <br>Tell us some experiences you had; how did these demons normally appear to you in the family?
    <br>How did they torment your life?
    <br>The woman, who was with me when I started these things, started losing her mind in the house.
    <br>When we were in the house, she would be afraid.
    <br>I wondered, "What is wrong with you?"
    <br>Whenever she was moving around in the house, she would grab me
    <br>and say that I must accompany her around the house.
    <br>I thought she was becoming crazy.
    <br>My bedroom was upstairs and when we went to the bedroom,
    <br>she would hold me like somebody who was lost and push me in front that I should go first.
    <br>She would follow from behind.
    <br>She was seeing things that I could not see.
    <br>I saw her as a mad woman.
    <br>In the bedroom, there was a bathroom.
    <br>Whenever she wanted to go to the toilet in the bathroom,
    <br>she would ask me to accompany her to the bathroom.
    <br>She started moving like a zombie – like somebody who was senseless in the house
    <br>because of the things she could see that I could not see.
    <br>She ended up leaving the house.
    <br>Could you explain to us; did you ask her what she was seeing?
    <br>I did not even think of asking her what she was seeing.
    <br>I was blind.
    <br>I did not ask her because I thought she was crazy; that was all I heard, "She is crazy".
    <br>When we are in these things, there is nothing that you would see.
    <br>I thought she was crazy.
    <br>She left the house and I lost that marriage.
    <br>After all this, I went for a business meeting in the DRC and was caught at the airport.
    <br>When I was at the airport, they told me that they were arresting me because of things I did 20 years ago.
    <br>I asked them, "I am being called for things I did 20 years ago. Why did you not arrest me all these years?"
    <br>That was how I ended up in prison.
    <br>When I landed in prison, people of God, that was when I caught up with Christ.
    <br>When I ended up in prison, I started looking at the Bible.
    <br>When I ended up in prison, I started crying.
    <br>When I ended up in prison, I started seeking Christ.
    <br>When I was in prison, I heard a voice that said to me,
    <br>"Whenever you leave this prison, you must leave this prison married."
    <br>I had no love, people of God.
    <br>The love that you see me having now, I did not have it.
    <br>The spirit made me to use women.
    <br>That was my job because I had money.
    <br>I would give a woman whatever amount I wanted and use her.
    <br>That was me.
    <br>That was not love.
    <br>God said to me that I must not leave that place without getting married.
    <br>I phoned her and at the time I phoned her, I had already chased her away from my place.
    <br>I was already fed up with her; I had already had enough of her.
    <br>I had told her to go home.
    <br>I had only been with her for three weeks at that time.
    <br>I told her to buy a ring and bring the ring to the prison on obedience to the voice I had heard.
    <br>When she came to prison, I had no choice but to kneel down in front of the prison wardens and I married her.
    <br>As you can see, we are married today.
    <br>You mean that you got married to your wife while you were in prison?
    <br>I got married to her while I was in prison.
    <br>You said that this very demonic influence made you to move from one woman to another.
    <br>Could you tell us how this has really destroyed your marriage
    <br>and if there were any children you had in the course of this?
    <br>Could you tell us the extent to which this has affected your marital life?
    <br>People of God, with those spirits – the bush, river and all the other sectors, the grave,
    <br>I ended up with different women and I had 13 children.
    <br>She is taking care of the 13 children.
    <br>Thirteen children!
    <br>I did not get them in decent places.
    <br>I got them in the car, bush, in the water;
    <br>I took a lot of women and made love with them in the water.
    <br>That was the kind of life I went through.
    <br>Before you tell us how you came to know about The SCOAN, that led you to this place for your deliverance,
    <br>could you tell us exactly what the man of God said in the message of prophecy that very Sunday.
    <br>The man of God in the message of prophecy said that I was possessed with a marine spirit.
    <br>I was not married.
    <br>In the clip, you saw that I was arguing with the man of God that I was married
    <br>but the man of God said that I was not married, which was true because in the physical,
    <br>I am married but in the spirit, I was not married because I was married to all those spiritual women.
    <br>I could not for the past four years have relations with her as my wife.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that problem because I was about to tell her to go.
    <br>When I came here, I reported to the man of God that I did not have sexual relations with her.
    <br>In my second week here the man of God gave me a room where I could stay with my wife.
    <br>What was exactly the problem you were having and how did this problem affect your marriage?
    <br>What kind of images were you seeing in your dreams, in the physical?
    <br>How did they affect your life before you finally received your deliverance?
    <br>We know that you have a wonderful testimony to give,
    <br>but before that, tell us how this problem really affected your life before your final deliverance.
    <br>When my first wife left, I was left alone in the house.
    <br>When I was alone in the house, I had a vision while I was sleeping.
    <br>Something I could see physically – I could see small people.
    <br>My room was upstairs.
    <br>I saw these small people using ropes to climb to my bedroom.
    <br>They jumped in while I was sleeping.
    <br>I was looking at them but it was like a vision.
    <br>When they came into my bedroom, they looked around;
    <br>I was looking at them wondering what they were looking around for.
    <br>Then it came to my mind, that they were looking around for my ex-wife who had been with me.
    <br>It meant that while I was busy with the other side,
    <br>my ex-wife was busy with these small people on her side.
    <br>Since they could not see her, they looked at me and started coming to me.
    <br>When I looked at them, they started stripping off their trousers.
    <br>They came to me and wanted to take off my trousers; I was wearing pyjamas.
    <br>I realised that they wanted to sleep with me and I woke up.
    <br>This was the experience I had immediately my wife left and I was with these people.
    <br>Now, finally, tell us the exact problem you had between you and your wife,
    <br>as a result of you being involved with these demonic influences.
    <br>How did it affect the marriage between you and your current wife, before your deliverance?
    <br>I could not sleep with her for the past four years because I had already divorced my past life.
    <br>That was the biggest mistake I made.
    <br>When I was trying to focus on her, because I was still married to these spirits,
    <br>they stopped me from having sexual relations with my wife.
    <br>What does it mean?
    <br>When I started to touch her and my manhood started to rise,
    <br>I would feel a pain that I had never felt before in my life.
    <br>I would then quickly push her aside and stay on my own.
    <br>That had continued for the past four years.
    <br>I could not sleep hugging her by my side.
    <br>I could not turn on my side.
    <br>My sleeping position for the past four years has been on my back.
    <br>That meant that I could not touch her, I could not do anything with her.
    <br>Because of the pain, I had to sleep with my legs straddled like this.
    <br>If I closed my legs, the pain would start.
    <br>I said to myself, "This is no life".
    <br>I was introduced to Emmanuel TV by a man who had come to my house.
    <br>When I was in prison, all my houses and cars were going.
    <br>All the cars I had were gone.
    <br>My houses were gone – one house remained.
    <br>It meant that when I came out of prison, I would not have a house.
    <br>All the money I had…
    <br>We came here with money I borrowed – the man who was controlling millions.
    <br>I faced this nightmare for long before coming to The SCOAN.
    <br>I was introduced to Emmanuel TV, I prayed all the time over the screen, but nothing was going on.
    <br>I said to my wife, "Let us borrow money and go to The SCOAN".
    <br>If nothing happened to me at The SCOAN, I did not tell her but I had decided to commit suicide.
    <br>That was what I told myself.
    <br>I'm sorry for that.
    <br>I told myself that I would commit suicide if nothing happened.
    <br>I could not have somebody staying next to me for four years as a tool – I could no longer bear it.
    <br>When I came here, I had faith after seeing everything on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I said, "The man of God can't fail to solve this small thing
    <br>when I have seen big things happening on Emmanuel TV."

    <br>When our transport pulled up at The SCOAN, I felt energy.
    <br>I said to myself that my problem would be solved here.
    <br>I have a medical report from doctors stating that they could not solve my problem.
    <br>They have operated me twice and I refused to be operated for the third time.
    <br>They gave me a medical report that there was nothing they could do
    <br>but when I came here, I said to myself, "My problem is solved".
    <br>When we were taken to our dining hall and rooms on the first day, I could feel energy within me.
    <br>I started doing exercises which I was no longer doing.
    <br>If you ask the people who stay with me, I love exercising.
    <br>I started doing exercises and had the faith that my problems would be solved.

    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Can you tell us, what happened immediately after you received the message of prophecy?
    <br>We were given a private room – and we went inside of it.
    <br>I can see that some people are laughing already.
    <br>Exactly - now, I am healed.
    <br>Everything I experienced the past four years is gone.
    <br>She is now my wife.
    <br>It is unfortunate that she is going to pay for the last four years.
    <br>I am saved, people of God.
    <br>All the troubles that brought me to The SCOAN are things of the past.
    <br>I thank the ministry of T.B. Joshua, The SCOAN, I thank even those who are watching this at home.
    <br>This is where you get life.
    <br>This is where you get deliverance.
    <br>You get all you need through Christ Jesus.

    <br>Once again, shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>Now, we thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.
    <br>So far so good.
    <br>We rejoice with you greatly.
    <br>We believe you are in the best position, with all your experiences with demonic influences
    <br>to give words of advice to all of us.
    <br>Based on your experience, what word of advice do you have
    <br>for those who are listening to you all over the world?
    <br>Many of us wear beautiful suits and you can see us walking around – problems.
    <br>My advice to men: Stop craving for power that is unnecessary.
    <br>Stop going to places that are unnecessary for power.
    <br>Power only comes from God.
    <br>Look to God, He is the One who will give you power.
    <br>The power you are looking for is what will make you to sleep with different women
    <br>and after everything, you will come home and give your wife HIV/AIDS.
    <br>Just to say something: God wanted to use me as a "satellite" to you.
    <br>I went to the doctor after all these experiences - and I never used a condom in my life -
    <br>and the doctor said to me that I was the healthiest man ever.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for everything He has done in your life.
    <br>We also want to ask you finally for the benefit of our viewers all over the world:
    <br>You said that before you could not sleep on your side, and you could only lie on your back.
    <br>You also used to experience pain in your manhood.
    <br>What can you say after your deliverance?
    <br>Is the pain over?
    <br>Everything is over.
    <br>Let's put our hands beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>Finally, let's hear from your wife.
    <br>My name is Safira Buthelezi.
    <br>I am from South Africa and he is my husband.
    <br>He said it all.
    <br>I am a happy woman now.
    <br>The man of God was saying last week: "New dream. New marriage" - he was talking to me.
    <br>Everything in my house is new.
    <br>It is a new dream, it is a new everything.
    <br>My kids are new.
    <br>I believe they are delivered, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Mr Jabulani Buthelezi & Wife
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>That is indeed the summary of the whole thing.
    <br>She knows that the husband has actually touched every angle of this story.
    <br>Now, finally, what word of advice do you have for women who are out there?
    <br>Women all over the world - I am saying to you - a man is somebody who needs our support.
    <br>Support our men; they need us - that's why Eve was created.
    <br>Hold on to your husbands, regardless of what they are going through - hold on -
    <br>and it is going to happen because it happened in my family.
    <br>Amen. Thank you very much.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ once again!
    <br>Indeed, it is a life experience.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has done in this family, to the glory of God.
    <br>We also want to admonish this by telling you that in as much as you are delivered through the Word of God,
    <br>you should go and make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>As you do so, you should always remember that better is not good enough - the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Once again, shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>I want to say that before I could not meet my husband as "husband and wife" and he used to get so angry.
    <br>He would be so sensitive about every small thing.
    <br>But now - the miracle has just happened.
    <br>Miracle happened to me and it can still happen to you.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>He doesn't have pain any more.
    <br>I saw flames in him - he was doing push-ups - I was like "Wow! This is my first time."
    <br>Glory be to God!
