  <p>    
    <br>Come on. Can I talk to you?
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am fine, sir.
    <br>I hope if I talk to you, you will not be annoyed?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>Are you here for deliverance?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Because you are a drunkard.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>As beautiful as you are, each time you finish and people see you drunk,
    <br>they always pity you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>There was a time you were half-naked.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>They had to pull you out of the gutter.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>There was a time they abused you when you took this.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>She didn't know that they abused her; it was when she woke up,
    <br>she saw sperms on her body.
    <br>Almost five people abused her.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>It is a curse.
    <br>Man of God, what you said is true.
    <br>My own problem is that when I drink, I aIways beat up my children.
    <br>When you drink, you always beat up your children?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>All the money I was having, I would spend it.
    <br>Sometimes, I would drink for one week without stopping.
    <br>I would not eat anything.
    <br>Every day, I would  smoke four packets of cigarettes.
    <br>When I finished doing it, I would start regretting.
    <br>I don't even know what got me into doing that -
    <br>either I would be too happy or too sad and I would start.
    <br>Lately, I have been wanting to commit suicide for no reason.
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Shall we rise up.
    <br>What shall we say unto the Lord
    <br>All we have to say is thank You Lord
    <br>What shall we say unto the Lord
    <br>All we have to say is thank You Lord
    <br>Thank You, Lord
    <br>Thank You, Lord
    <br>All we have to say is thank You Lord
    <br>Praise the Lord! Children of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs. Sandra Shaw.
    <br>This is my husband and my two children.
    <br>I want to thank God for my life and my family.
    <br>Sunday was the first time I had been to The SCOAN.
    <br>I had never seen the prophet before in my life.
    <br>When he was giving prophecies, he came to my seat and called me out
    <br>and said to me, "You are a drunkard".
    <br>I was shocked and embarrassed but something in me said,
    <br>"You know why you came".
    <br>I had been to places but they had never told me that I was a drunkard before.
    <br>They had always said that I had a spiritual husband
    <br>but nobody had ever told me my problem; I knew my problem.
    <br>So, when the man of God said that, I said, "Thank You, Lord" in my heart,
    <br>that, that was my final bus stop.
    <br>I said, "Yes, sir".
    <br>He said that he hoped I would not be offended if he told me my problem.
    <br>I replied that with all due respect he should please say it
    <br>because everybody knew that the only problem I had was that of drinking.
    <br>I was not ashamed to say that I drank because I had been praying for deliverance.
    <br>Come on. Can I talk to you?
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I am fine, sir.
    <br>I hope if I talk to you, you will not be annoyed?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>Are you here for deliverance?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Because you are a drunkard.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>The man of God said that there was a time I was drunk
    <br>and found myself in a gutter and that I had been abused but did not know.
    <br>There was a time they abused you when you took this.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>She didn't know that they abused her; it was when she woke up,
    <br>she saw sperms on her body.
    <br>Almost five people abused her.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>It is a curse.
    <br>In my heart, I said yes.
    <br>In my heart, I knew that once that thing happens...
    <br>I have gotten drunk and after that prepared poison for my kids to drink.
    <br>The only thing that saved my kids was that on that day, a friend took them out
    <br>and refused to release them to me.
    <br>I abused her; I was stoning her gate.
    <br>I said I would cause alarm but she refused to release them.
    <br>If she would have released them, they would have eaten the poison and died.
    <br>Especially my first son, if I got drunk, I would hate him for no reason.
    <br>I would beat him for three days, injure him. I would carry a knife and a bottle.
    <br>Even to see my husband, I would get sad.
    <br>It all started after I had my second son, Daniel, twelve years ago.
    <br>Three weeks after I had given birth to him, my husband bought me a car
    <br>and I had a party.
    <br>The following day, I had a dream.
    <br>In that dream, I was naked and mad, wandering around the streets.
    <br>I woke up and I didn't understand the dream.
    <br>Then, I was not a Christian; I did not go to church.
    <br>I didn't consider the dream; I never even shared it with anybody.
    <br>The next day, I realised that I started bleeding.
    <br>For one year, I had my period, nonstop.
    <br>I went to the clinic and they told me that maybe I had the 'baby blues'.
    <br>Each day, I would be sad.
    <br>I would drink in a way that if you came to my house, you would never know
    <br>that I was drinking because I did it secretly.
    <br>In a day, I could consume 7-8 packets of cigarettes.
    <br>Each time I smoked and drank, something would tell me
    <br>to just enter my car and drive away.
    <br>I would go out without knowing where I was going.
    <br>Afterwards, I would not even remember that I drove somewhere.
    <br>Sometimes, at midnight, 2 AM, 4 AM or 6 AM, I would be driving.
    <br>I would wake up at 10 AM and find myself resting on the steering wheel.
    <br>I would find myself in an unknown location.
    <br>Sometimes, I would drive to the beach, thinking I would drive into the sea.
    <br>I once tried it in Ghana and when I was close to the water, the car engine died.
    <br>It wouldn't start and then, people started gathering.
    <br>Does it mean when you are driving, you park in the midnight and sleep inside the vehicle?
    <br>I wouldn't know I had been driving, how the car stopped or where I was.
    <br>And you would sit inside it there?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Who would now come to wake you up inside in the vehicle?
    <br>By the time people would wake me, they would have stolen my phones,
    <br>my bag and taken everything in the car.
    <br>In 2009, I had a serious accident.
    <br>Under six years, I have had 8 serious accidents that almost took my life
    <br>but nothing happened to me; the air bag would come out.
    <br>In those eight accidents, my car was destroyed beyond repair.
    <br>The airbag would come out and nothing would happen to me.
    <br>In 2009, I had a very serious accident.
    <br>That accident was the reason I later relocated to Ghana.
    <br>The accident took place in Port Harcourt.
    <br>In that accident, the guy in the vehicle that I had hit, they had to amputate his leg.
    <br>At that time, my husband and I had already started having problems
    <br>because of the drinking; he was no longer happy with the marriage.
    <br>The family of the guy had to fly him out and I had to pay for it.
    <br>I had to sell my property of almost $100,000 to be able to send him
    <br>to USA for medical treatment.
    <br>Anytime I got drunk, I would fight my husband.
    <br>Sometimes, I would pick up the phone and call his employers.
    <br>and started threatening them that if they didn't fire him, I would kill them,
    <br>destroy the company house they had given us and fight all the workers.
    <br>The next day, they would call him and tell him that they were happy with him
    <br>but that they couldn't take this.
    <br>They would say, "Our company is well respected, so we are sorry but
    <br>we can no longer employ you".
    <br>They said that if he wanted to work for them, they would have to transfer him
    <br>to a place far from me and that as long as he stayed with me,
    <br>he couldn't work for them.
    <br>They would sack him. Every month, he would lose his job because of me.
    <br>Still yet, he would stay with me.
    <br>He lost all the friends he had made
    <br>since he came to this country, 35 years ago.
    <br>Nobody talks to him, nobody sits with him because he is still married to me.
    <br>They would say, "We don't know why you're still with this lady that always disgraces you".
    <br>The money he earned every month,
    <br>sometimes up to $30,000, he would give me.
    <br>I can't account for any of it.
    <br>All the money he had worked for, for the past 15 years, I would spend it.
    <br>I wouldn't even know what I used it for because of the alcohol.
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw - Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God called me out and told me my problem.
    <br>For over 15 years, I had been looking for a solution.
    <br>I got tired of looking for a solution.
    <br>I told God when I came on Sunday that I didn't want to enter 2014
    <br>with this disease or I would kill myself.
    <br>I prayed and fasted before I came.
    <br>I told God that it was my last bus stop.
    <br>I thank God for answering my prayer
    <br>because I never believed I would survive this year.
    <br>I told my God that I didn't want to enter next year with this shame.
    <br>Anywhere I went, people didn't want to have anything to do with me.
    <br>Nobody would want to sit with me.
    <br>Everyone that was supposed to respect me would disrespect me
    <br>because I was an alcoholic.
    <br>I don't find joy in doing it.
    <br>Sometimes, I think, and regret.
    <br>I lost the respect from my children because of my character.
    <br>After my deliverance, for the past week, I have been in the presence of the Lord.
    <br>I have not felt that pain in my heart nor had the urge to drink or smoke.
    <br>I bless God!
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>You've listened to that. Let's hear that part again.
    <br>After that deliverance, the urge to smoke, to drink - tell us!
    <br>I noticed these, every week.
    <br>The church I attended in Ghana has a programme on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays.
    <br>On Mondays, I would drink so that on Tuesdays, I could not go to church.
    <br>Then I would drink on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
    <br>On Thursdays, I would not drink.
    <br>During the early mornings between 2am and 3am on Thursday mornings,
    <br>something would talk to me, "Have a cigarette; have a drink".
    <br>I would have one drink and it would seem as if something had stepped out
    <br>of me and something else had entered.
    <br>I would drink on Fridays and Saturdays.
    <br>On Sundays, I wouldn't be able to go to church.
    <br>It would always happen and in a week, I would have three crises.
    <br>I could wake up happy but then I would start drinking and playing music
    <br>or I would wake up very sad that there would be nothing anybody could do to please me.
    <br>The only people I wanted to hang out with were those who drank.
    <br>If you meant me well, I would not want to be around you.
    <br>After my deliverance on Sunday, that night I dreamt that I saw the man of God.
    <br>The clothes the man of God wore when I saw him on Monday night
    <br>were the same clothes he wore in my dream on Sunday night.
    <br>I was climbing a step.
    <br>As I was climbing the step, the man of God was coming out.
    <br>He said to me, "My daughter, keep climbing; don't look back.
    <br>Just keep going; don't look back. Just go".
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>I woke up from that dream and found myself in the camp here. I said, "God, thank You.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!" because I have always said, when a man of God prophesies to you,
    <br>that there is solution to your problem
    <br>and when you see him in the  dream, indeed you are healed.
    <br>And I said to myself, I even told the people around me that I know that I am healed.
    <br>I feel free! So, since that Monday, the pain...
    <br>Previously, I was scared to go home or anytime it was almost morning, I would be scared
    <br>because I knew that pain would come with full force.
    <br>But since Monday, I have not had any pain in my heart or the urge to drink.
    <br>Each time I think of drinking or smoking, it disgusts me.
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>What message do you have for the whole world?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want you to know that there is God.
    <br>In any situation you are passing through, just believe in God.
    <br>Let no human being tell you that he will take you here or there.
    <br>I went to some places and was told that if I drank the root once,
    <br>that once I drank it, if I saw alcohol, I would throw up.
    <br>But to my greatest surprise, when I went to such places, my problem became worse than before.
    <br>I want you to know that God is God, and He is the only One who will save you.
    <br>Whoever is having the problem I once had,
    <br>I want you to pick up the courage to come down here, because God is here.
    <br>I didn't even believe that God was here.
    <br>Previously, when people would advise me to come to T.B. Joshua,
    <br>I would reply that they should not talk about it.
    <br>I did not want to go where they cast one out and put 100.
    <br>For 12 years, I had been looking for a solution. This is the first man of God
    <br>who has told me my problem, and hit where it had been happening.
    <br>I bless God for his life and family. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I want you not to give up; have courage.
    <br>When I was coming here, the devil was telling me that if I came, I would die.
    <br>I faced challenges. Even on Sunday when I was sitting down,
    <br>the evil spirit told me to leave.
    <br>I told God this was my final bus stop
    <br>and I wouldn't enter next year with this disease.
    <br>It was a decision I made.
    <br>So, no matter what the devil is telling you, that he will kill you
    <br>or any other thing, don't mind the devil.
    <br>He is only fighting to be able to put you in bondage.
    <br>Pick up courage and come.
    <br>Even though you cannot afford to come,
    <br>there are so many people that can assist you.
    <br>If you want, I can assist you.
    <br>If you look at me, you would know that money is not my problem.
    <br>To have money and be humiliated is the worst thing that can happen to you.
    <br>There was a time I prayed to God, saying, "Let me be poor but have my peace".
    <br>Right now, I have my peace and joy, and I am not ashamed to say it.
    <br>I thank God for my life.
    <br>Oh! I like that language. I want you to repeat once again.
    <br>That is, money is not a problem.
    <br>She said there is everything.
    <br>Tell those who believe so much in money.
    <br>Much money, money - they believe so much in money!
    <br>She said that there was a time she prayed for money to go and have peace instead.
    <br>Please start from the issue of money because when my people here hear 'money', they laugh;
    <br>when they hear other things, they clap.
    <br>You see! Nobody claps when they hear 'money'.
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Children of God, I want you to know money is not the problem
    <br>because if you look at me, you would know that I have it all
    <br>but I didn't have peace.
    <br>It got to a point I told God to make me poor and let me have peace.
    <br>Now, I can sleep and eat. I have peace and joy.
    <br>I thank God for His mercy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>By what you are saying now, shows that in the past,
    <br>you really wanted to get out of the mess - the problem - because you did not like that lifestyle.
    <br>You just did not know how to get out of it.
    <br>Tell us about that.
    <br>Man of God, for the past eight years I have been living on my own.
    <br>I had not separated or divorced my husband but I chose to live on my own
    <br>because I didn't want to cause him any pain or make him lose his job.
    <br>Ever since I moved Ghana, he has kept a steady job, except when he was sick.
    <br>I had to bring my children to go to school in Nigeria, whilst I was in Ghana
    <br>so that they could be in boarding school.
    <br>During the weekends, they would come home to be with their dad.
    <br>I saw myself as the problem.
    <br>Everyone would be happy but every time I came, everyone would be scared.
    <br>My son would not even have the appetite to eat once he saw me.
    <br>Not that he doesn't love me but he would be scared
    <br>because he knew that every two days, I would have a crisis.
    <br>Whenever I had crisis, he and his father would be the ones to suffer.
    <br>It had affected me and my marriage so much.
    <br>I couldn't do any business. Any money I put into any business would crumble.
    <br>I could drink and spend between $10,000 - $20,000 in a week.
    <br>My name is Jerry Shaw.
    <br>Sandra is my wife and these are my two children.
    <br>For the past five years, it had been hell.
    <br>It has been absolute hell because of the way Sandra behaved.
    <br>Concerning the drinking for the past five years, the more she would drink,
    <br>the angrier she would get, until she  became extremely violent.
    <br>The more violent she got, the more she would turn against the children.
    <br>It is not even up to 10 weeks ago that she was visiting.
    <br>At that time, I was in Abu Dhabi.
    <br>People had to come to the house to rescue the children.
    <br>They had to take them somewhere else and hide them because of her temper.
    <br>She was ripping the flat screen TVs off the walls in the whole house.
    <br>She would smash the TVs on the floor in hot temper because of the alcohol.
    <br>This had been the same chorus for the past five years.
    <br>Before that, she had problems with alcohol but she was manageable.
    <br>For the past five years, she just turned absolutely crazy with the alcohol.
    <br>The difference I see in her this week is much.
    <br>This morning, when she woke up, she was happy and friendly.
    <br>She wasn't like before, snapping at the kids and shouting at everybody.
    <br>This morning when she got up, she was happy.
    <br>She bathed the kids and made sure everyone was okay.
    <br>The kids were terrified of her.
    <br>If you see the children, they were terrified of her.
    <br>As soon as she drank, they would run away and hide.
    <br>When she was sober, there would be no problem and they would love her to bits.
    <br>But as soon as she would have a drink, it was a major problem.
    <br>So, I have seen a massive difference today.
    <br>She is happy, expressing herself and talking.
    <br>She is happy with the kids. She came downstairs to have breakfast,
    <br>which she would never ever do before.
    <br>Now, she is doing it; so, I thank God.
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Wow! You have listened to that.
    <br>I think if the Lord would anoint a minister of God especially for this issue,
    <br>because there are many people in camps for reformation.
    <br>In many homes, children of the rich, heroes,  and presidents are in the camp;
    <br>because of addictions.
    <br>If I am right, let me see your hands.
    <br>This problem is all over the world; all over the world.
    <br>There is no solution.
    <br>We pray that God should anoint ministers of God that can rescue these people all over the world.
    <br>Deliver them just like our sister here has been delivered.
    <br>We want to say happy marriage once again.
    <br>I want to salute our father, who just spoke.
    <br>Ninety percent of men cannot bear what he has borne.
    <br>Mr Jerry Shaw
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>If I may say ninety-nine percent.
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Listen!
    <br>I used to say that to people as a minister of God.
    <br>The issue of racism is not colour.
    <br>It is not an issue of colour.
    <br>They say, "This person is racist, this one is racist, this one is black, this one is white".
    <br>No! The issue of racism is not colour; it is a spirit.
    <br>Can you see what is happening between this husband and wife?
    <br>He was not bearing all those things because the woman was black or white
    <br>but he bore it because he has a good heart.
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>In the world, racism is a discussion based on colour.
    <br>It is not an issue of colour; it is evil spirit in a man or woman.
    <br>I am very sure if it were a black man that married our sister here,
    <br>he would not stand the pain.
    <br>If I am right, let me see your hand!
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>They will not stand the pain
    <br>but here is a brother from a different racial background that stood the pain.
    <br>He saw her pain as his own pain.
    <br>Imagine, if our father here had left the marriage a long time ago,
    <br>this woman would have died.
    <br>The woman is alive because the man is with her.
    <br>That is the solution.
    <br>We are having this discussion today because this man is still in the marriage.
    <br>If this man had divorced her a long time ago, we would not be talking about this today.
    <br>She needed a companion like this man, to stay alive.
    <br>She's here today.
    <br>So, tell the whole world.
    <br>Please stretch your hand.
    <br>The issue of racism is not colour.
    <br>It is not colour!
    <br>It is the issue of evil spirit!
    <br>It is not colour!!
    <br>It is not white or black or green.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Mrs Sandra Shaw & Family
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Rise up!
    <br>Majesty
