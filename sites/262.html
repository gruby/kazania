    <br>How To Know Your Calling In Life - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Thank you. Thank you, you may be seated.
    <br>Thank you Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>God with us!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I know that you are blessed today.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty!
    <br>This is the opportunity to ask the question that people always ask me.
    <br>Anytime people meet me they will say,
    <br>"How do I know what my calling from God is?"
    <br>Say to your neighbour, "How do I know what my calling from God is?"
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>But whatever you do through God that is your calling.
    <br>How can we do things through God?
    <br>When God speaks to us through His Word, by His Spirit,
    <br>how do I know what my calling from God is?
    <br>Are you a carpenter?
    <br>Whatever He accepts you to do through Him, that is your calling.
    <br>People will say, what is my calling?
    <br>Why did this happen to me?
    <br>Why am I not prospering?
    <br>Whenever you are doing something through God,
    <br>God will continue to speak strength and courage through your trials, take notice of that.
    <br>If God permits me to carry this through Him;
    <br>I am carrying it through Him.
    <br>He will continue to speak strength and courage through my trials.
    <br>My trial could be this or that.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The title is of this message is: "Call of God."
    <br>Say, "Call of God."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Call of God
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Call of God.
    <br>Lets take a look at Psalm 119:105.
    <br>Read and follow me,
    <br>"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Listen to that, it said...
    <br>"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."
    <br>So, that answered your question, "What is my calling?"
    <br>Am I really a lawyer?
    <br>If I am called as a lawyer, why is this happening to me?
    <br>Am, I really a medical doctor?
    <br>If I am really a medical doctor, if this is my calling;
    <br>why is this happening to me?
    <br>This is an answer to question.
    <br>If His word is a lamp to your feet and a light to your path,
    <br>It means the first step in knowing your calling
    <br>is to get to know God better by reading His Word.
    <br>As God communicates to you through His Word, by His Spirit,
    <br>you will know what He wants you to do and where He wants you to go.
    <br>He cannot interact you with, He cannot act with you,
    <br>and you cannot hear from Him without His Word.
    <br>Let's go to the book of Roman 12:2.
    <br>It says, " Do not conform to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
    <br>that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."
    <br>When you let God transform you by the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>He will literally begin to show you the way.
    <br>Then you can know, where He wants you to go,
    <br>how He wants you to do this, how He wants you to do that.
    <br>Many of us we don't allow God to transform us.
    <br>Not only must you become a pastor through His Word, but also by His Spirit.
    <br>His Word refreshes our mind and His Spirit renews our strength.
    <br>He is waiting for you at the point of His Spirit.
    <br>You can go anywhere to learn His Word.
    <br>You can choose to go to school, you can go to anywhere with no more problem - you can learn it.
    <br>You can be very very thorough,
    <br>but when it comes to His Spirit, He gives it.
    <br>You must be ready to be reformed.
    <br>You must abide by His principles.
    <br>You can learn His Word, say "God is this,  God is that, God is Saviour..."
    <br>You can preach the word from Genesis to Revelation,
    <br>you have thorough knowledge of God - that does not make your His child.
    <br>Can you see where our problem is now?
    <br>That I am standing here telling you that God is this, Jesus is this or that -
    <br>it's not enough for you to say that this is a man of God;
    <br>because anybody can stand here to preach it, whereas he's not the one.
    <br>Not only must you have God's Word in order to be born again,
    <br>you must have God's Spirit.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because God's Word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God's Word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit."
    <br>If God's Word is not in the hands of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>whatever you are saying, you are saying it to yourself,
    <br>You are speaking of yourself and not of God.
    <br>God's Word is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit
    <br>to nurture us and furnish us with everything that we need to succeed on earth.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If God's Word is not in the hands of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>whatever you are saying, you are speaking of yourself.
    <br>"Be healed!" - you are wasting your time.
    <br>"Be delivered!" - you are wasting your time.
    <br>"Be saved!" - you are wasting your time.
    <br>You are prophesying that it will rain tomorrow; it will not rain!
    <br>Read it, it is food for your soul.
    <br>Read it, it is a guide for your feet.
    <br>Read it!  It has a purifying power.
    <br>Read it!  It has a converting power.
    <br>It is enduring, read it!
    <br>It rejoices the heart, read it!
    <br>To keep you from sin and error, read it!
    <br>Read it, it is so profitable.
    <br>Like I have said;
    <br>it is the tool in the hands of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>If it's not in the hands of the Holy Ghost, whatever you are saying,
    <br>you are talking of yourself.
    <br>That is why you see people saying "In the name of Jesus!..."
    <br>Sometime you see people people praying and praying.
    <br>Shaking, shaking...
    <br>Praying, jumping...
    <br>At the end of the day it results into a headache.
    <br>Nothing comes out of it.
    <br>Many are getting frustrated fasting and praying,
    <br>and they begin to count for how long they have been a Christian.
    <br>Many will read Bible and place it on their chest, when they want to sleep.
    <br>That is when satan will come to flock them.
    <br>Even sometime satan will carry the Bible from their chest and put it down
    <br>and begin to flock them, and say, "This Bible - where did you get it?"
    <br>There is a Bible; there is the Holy Bible.
    <br>Anybody can buy a Bible; not everyone has access to the Holy Bible.
    <br>The Bible is for sale, but the Holy Bible is not.
    <br>You can find a Bible in the library, but the Holy Bible is not in the library.
    <br>It's in your heart.
    <br>Many authors of this Bible that you have today - they are not Christians, they are philosophers.
    <br>They wrote this bible for the sake of getting money out of it.
    <br>They are not Christians, they don't believe what they have - they are historians.
    <br>When you are carrying it, if it's not in the hands of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>you are carrying a book.
    <br>When you talk, if it's not in the mouth of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>you are talking to yourself.
    <br>When you preach it, if that is not from the Holy Ghost,
    <br>you are just telling them history.
    <br>History is all about events, if it's not from the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Talk scripture in every conversation.
    <br>You want to make a call, you say,
    <br>"- Hello,  hello?"
    <br>-Oh hello, sir!
    <br>- You are blessed!
    <br>- With God all things are possible!
    <br>- Thank you sir! 
    <br>- Yes, where are you going this morning?
    <br>- Carry God along."
    <br>Talk Scripture!
    <br>Your may be on the phone or in a business transaction; talk Scripture.
    <br>Use the Word of God to answer someone.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Use the Word of God to answer someone."
    <br>The Word of God becomes your data base for your personal opinion.
    <br>I want tell you, the questions you always ask; I believe a few of them have been answered.
    <br>"How do I know what my calling from God is?"
    <br>Look!
    <br>When I know your weakness, I will be able to help you and also trust you.
    <br>We can get on with this, continuing.
    <br>You are because I am;
    <br>I am because you are.
    <br>I know you laugh...
    <br>The reason why I am and you are is to help you and for you to help me.
    <br>When I know that you laugh anyhow, I know that is my own assignment to help you.
    <br>That will not cause our conflict.
    <br>We will never fight because you laugh anyhow;
    <br>because I know your weakness, I will be thinking about how I can help you to get rid of that.
    <br>Look at what happened to Apostle Paul.
    <br>When your weakness is the means of drawing your close to God,
    <br>to pray the more and fast more; it's no more a weakness; i t is a blessing.
    <br>That is the foolish thing the Bible is talking about.
    <br>The problem we have today - you believe there is time to pray, fast, and say amen!
    <br>That is why satan gets your just like that, cheaply.
    <br>Your altar is in your heart.
    <br>Going to a place before you pray; before you get there, satan will get you.
    <br>They know you have a place to pray.
    <br>No!
    <br>When you move, you need to pray in you heart - it is  your altar.
    <br>Anytime there is an encounter, a thought or in your heart, you should immediately begin to blow him;
    <br>while you are standing, walking, and anywhere you are begin to confess,
    <br>begin to say "You have come again? You don't know I am a child of God? I will deal with you! I will finish you!"
    <br>Begin to talk again, talk as if you are talking to a person.
    <br>See satan as a person.
    <br>The reason why satan wants you to talk his language
    <br>is to overthrow your position.
    <br>He wants to overthrow the position you occupy before God.
    <br>He wants to overthrow it.
    <br>That is the reason why he wants you to talk his language, to think like him.
    <br>Once that thought is drawing you more and more into the midst of God, it is no longer satan's thought.
    <br>He is a mean to strengthen your desire.
    <br>If you are where God wants you to be, even though you walk through
    <br>the valley of the shadow of death, you will fear no evil
    <br>because you are where God wants you to be.
    <br>It is when we are not where God wants us to be, fear comes,
    <br>trouble comes.
    <br>But if you are where God want you to be,
    <br>the Lord will continue to speak strength and courage through your trials.
    <br>We believe that you have been inspired by the clip that you have just watched.
