  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I know your faith is lifted up.
    <br>That is the only way out; only faith pleases God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let us pay a visit to Abraham.
    <br>Abraham, the father of faith.
    <br>Let's take a look at Genesis 22.
    <br>A VISIT TO ABRAHAM
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "A visit to Abraham".
    <br>Let's look at verse 8.
    <br>"Abraham answered, 'God Himself will provide the lamb
    <br>for the burnt offering, my son.' And the two of them went on together".
    <br>Let's read together verse 8.
    <br>"Abraham answered, 'God Himself will provide the lamb
    <br>for the burnt offering, my son.' And the two of them went on together".
    <br>When you are facing challenges, you say, "God Himself will save me.
    <br>God Himself will provide."
    <br>When your "financial system" is down, you say, "God Himself will provide".
    <br>When everything is down, you say, "God Himself".
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>This means Abraham's faith...
    <br>When I talk of faith - belief.
    <br>Abraham's faith, I mean, Abraham's belief was not on Isaac but on God.
    <br>A VISIT TO ABRAHAM
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "A visit to Abraham".
    <br>We want to have a wisdom from that.
    <br>If our faith is on the Giver (God), even when what is given is taken away,
    <br>we will still have hope.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When our faith is on the Giver (God), even when what is given is taken away,
    <br>we will still have hope on God.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Many are not in the church today because the engine of their vehicle knocked.
    <br>Then, they say to their family, "We cannot go to church, there is no vehicle to convey us".
    <br>They have forgotten times when they were coming by a commercial vehicle to the church.
    <br>When what is given is taken away,
    <br>that is the more reason we should believe God the more,
    <br>have faith in God the more.
    <br>When your car engine is knocked, that is the more reason we should believe God more.
    <br>When you have health problems, challenges,
    <br>that is the more reason you should believe God.
    <br>Abraham was asked to sacrifice the only son.
    <br>Assuming he had faith on his only son,
    <br>he would not have had the courage to obey God's instruction.
    <br>Assuming Abraham had faith on his only son,
    <br>he would not have had courage to obey God's instruction.
    <br>Satan wants you to curse God.
    <br>Satan wants you to live outside the truth where your light is coming from.
    <br>While you are in pain, while under temptation,
    <br>while under affliction, he wants you to live outside the truth
    <br>where your light is coming from.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Those who bless God in their trial prove their sonship.
    <br>Those who bless God in pain prove their sonship.
    <br>Those who bless God while under temptation, tribulation, affliction
    <br>prove their sonship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Keep your focus".
    <br>Keep your focus because of the purpose of life.
    <br>The purpose of life is... while things are going good and going bad -
    <br>life must be balanced.
    <br>If life is not this way and that way, it is not balanced.
    <br>Life is balanced when one laughs awhile and frank.
    <br>There is a time to laugh, a time to cry, a time to rejoice and a time to be sad.
    <br>Keep your focus.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>If your faith, belief is on your possessions,
    <br>you will continue to be a friend of satan.
    <br>If your faith, I mean, your belief is on your possessions,
    <br>you will continue to be tempted.
    <br>From one temptation to another.
    <br>When satan knows you like your possessions more than the Giver,
    <br>you will not have a second to rest.
    <br>24/7 - from one temptation to another.
    <br>When your car is "good" today, your children will be sick tomorrow.
    <br>When your children are fine today, your car will be "bad" tomorrow.
    <br>When your business is going well today,
    <br>you will have many funerals.
    <br>When money comes, there will be so much responsibility - where to put that money.
    <br>If your faith, belief is on your possessions 24/7, satan will continue to visit you.
    <br>What are the possessions?
    <br>Your money, property, your children, yourself.
    <br>Everything apart from God are your possessions.
    <br>Your health, your money, your property, your fame, your name, your everything.
    <br>If your belief is on your possessions 24/7, satan will continue to visit you;
    <br>you will not have peace or rest.
    <br>When you think you have overcome - another minute, an attack somewhere.
    <br>Because satan knows you have faith...
    <br>What is the meaning of "belief on our possessions"?
    <br>Something you cherish most.
    <br>Something that can disturb your attention.
    <br>Something that can disturb your relationship with God.
    <br>Something that can cause you worry, anxiety.
    <br>A VISIT TO ABRAHAM
    <br>Once again:
    <br>If our faith is on the Giver (God), even when what is given to us is taken away,
    <br>we will still have hope.
    <br>It will not make a difference, rather it will strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>When what is given is taken away,
    <br>it will strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>You will see a reason to pray the more, to fast the more, to stay close.
    <br>If your faith, belief is on your possessions 24/7, satan will continue to visit you
    <br>and you will not have rest.
    <br>Think over it.
    <br>Vanity upon vanity.
    <br>Pray against your weakness, not your situation.
    <br>Stay focused.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It is possible to have peace 24/7.
    <br>Peace is not on the outside but on the inside.
    <br>I am not talking of the peace on the outside.
    <br>Today, you judge a Christian by the peace on the outside, not on the inside.
    <br>When the goings are good, and the business is going well and everything is booming,
    <br>you want to meet your neighbour,  "Which church are you attending? I want to follow you there".
    <br>Because you see things going well, you want to follow him.
    <br>Those who have peace on the inside can only prove their sonship.
    <br>When satan knows that your faith is not on your possessions but on the Giver,
    <br>he will stop disturbing you.
    <br>If I'm talking to you...
    <br>If satan knows that your faith is not on your possessions but on God,
    <br>he will stop disturbing you.
    <br>He cannot touch any other thing apart from your possessions.
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>The only thing satan can touch are your possessions.
    <br>When he knows that your faith is not on your possessions but on God,
    <br>he will stop disturbing you
    <br>because disturbing you is a way of drawing you closer to God.
    <br>When he strikes on your possessions, you will see the need of God the more.
    <br>When he strikes on this, you will fast the more.
    <br>He will say, "This man - I'm trying to overthrow him,
    <br>but the more I strike on his possessions, the more he moves closer to God".
    <br>His aim is to overthrow you, your position before God.
    <br>When he knows that your faith is not on your possessions but God, he will stop disturbing you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"When satan knows that your faith is not on your possessions,
    <br>he will stop disturbing you."
    <br>When he knows that your faith is not on your possessions but the Giver,
    <br>he will stop disturbing you.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>When he hits your possessions, you get disturbed, you begin to curse God,
    <br>"Why? I serve You. Why is my business fallen? People outside there will be mocking me.
    <br>They will ask me which God I'm serving. Why is all this happening?"
    <br>When you want to pray, you will begin to say, "God, restore my business..."
    <br>You forget about every good thing God has been doing for you.
    <br>You will forget about everything; the goodness of God right from your birth,
    <br>even when you were an embryo - you forget about anything about God.
    <br>"Restore my business..."
    <br>Imagine you are saying it to your biological father that has been caring for you, loving you.
    <br>You forget everything.
    <br>Instead of saying, "Thank You, Jesus for what You have been doing" - "Restore my business!"
    <br>Until He restores that business, you will never say, "Thank You".
    <br>And this is what satan wants.
    <br>He wants you to misbehave, to show that you are ungrateful.
    <br>Anytime there is prayer now, you immediately go to your trouble,
    <br>"Heal me...".
    <br>You have forgotten everything the Lord has been doing.
    <br>"Heal me...".
    <br>To say "Thank You" - no way, until He heals you.
    <br>These are possessions we are talking about.
    <br>When satan knows that your faith is not on your possessions but the Giver of that possession,
    <br>he will stop disturbing you.
    <br>The reason why he disturbs you is to take you away from God.
    <br>I don't judge people by their possessions.
    <br>When you say, "This man is very rich, he has everything" - I will listen to you.
    <br>I don't judge people.
    <br>I judge people by the peace of heart.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>Peace of heart is above all.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Peace of heart is above all."
    <br>There is nothing apart from peace of heart that a criminal cannot have.
    <br>Criminal can be the richest man in the world.
    <br>Criminal can have fame, be known all over the world.
    <br>Criminal can have children that are professors all over.
    <br>Tell me what a criminal cannot have apart from peace of heart.
    <br>They can have fame, popularity, position, power.
    <br>There is nothing they cannot achieve.
    <br>The only thing they cannot achieve is peace of heart - sleep and close eyes.
    <br>Because of what they have done all over, they are always waiting for repercussion.
    <br>When they close their eyes, they are waiting for repercussion -
    <br>they think the repercussion can come next, from anywhere.
    <br>There is no peace of heart.
    <br>What makes you a Christian then,
    <br>when the Bible says a man can be poor yet be a friend of God?
    <br>The Bible says a man can be sick in body yet be a friend of God.
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>A man can be poor yet be a friend of God - a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>In the generation we have today - these are the messages you need.
    <br>The way you run "helter-skelter", trying to compare yourself to others...
    <br>Anytime you have competition, you will begin to say, "I'm serving a Living God.
    <br>The other man is not serving a Living God. I know my God will get it."
    <br>At the end of the day, if you did not get that contract, and the one serving satan got this contract,
    <br>you will begin to curse your God.
    <br>How can you put your God to the test?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How can you put your God to the test?"
    <br>It is we that God puts to the test, not we putting Him to the test.
    <br>We don't put God to the test.
    <br>We don't ask God to come and sit for an examination, where you are the marker,
    <br>as if you are the god, and God is the subject.
    <br>At the end of the day, you mark God that He has failed.
    <br>Is that not the meaning?
    <br>When you could not get the contract, God has failed.
    <br>Why should we put God to the test?
    <br>You are sick, and say, "My God must heal me. I fasted. Yes, I'm serving a Living God."
    <br>You are putting Him to the test.
    <br>You know what it means?
    <br>Or to give Him a time,
    <br>"If I don't get what I need today, I think I will have to do something about it."
    <br>This is why you cannot get what you are looking for.
    <br>The purpose of life is good and hard times alike.
    <br>Life is not one-sided:
    <br>when the goings are good and when the goings are hard.
    <br>This is life for you:
    <br>When the goings are good and when the goings are hard.
    <br>Hard times serve a purpose - to test your faith.
    <br>Your faith must be tested.
    <br>If your faith is not tested, you cannot be promoted.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If your faith is not tested, you cannot be promoted.
    <br>If your faith is not tested, your Christian life cannot grow;
    <br>you cannot grow spiritually.
    <br>Tests are meant for your belief.
    <br>By tests I mean trials - they are meant for your belief.
    <br>You refuse to grow because you avoid tests.
    <br>When tests come, you find all means outside God.
    <br>Outside God, one can get what one wants but without peace of heart.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Outside God, you can get money but without peace of heart.
    <br>Outside God you can get fame, popularity, crown, power, possession without peace of heart.
    <br>That is, outside God.
    <br>This is what I mean by "living outside the truth, where you light is coming from".
    <br>Outside the truth means outside God.
    <br>This message you receive from Abraham.
    <br>I pray your faith will grow today.
    <br>And from now on, you will begin to have faith on the Giver, not on the possession.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>Can't you hear what God said to satan when he said, "There is a man called Job"?
    <br>"What makes him righteous? Will you allow me to go and destroy him?"
    <br>"You can tamper with everything but his heart.
    <br>Don't go there."
    <br>Everything, even including the children, property was destroyed.
    <br>This is what I'm talking about.
    <br>Faith on the possession is faith on satan.
    <br>Faith on the possession is satan's trap.
    <br>Many people may not understand "faith on possession".
    <br>It means: when you begin to worship that possession,
    <br>and that possession seems to take your quality, precious, dear time off God.
    <br>That is faith on your possessions;
    <br>to take quality, dearest time, time you cherish off God.
    <br>Many of us travel all over the world just for business.
    <br>How many times do you really have time to be in one accord with God?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>As a man of God, I know the heart of everyone here.
    <br>If you receive a call, as you are sitting down,
    <br>that something that you have been expecting for so long has been released
    <br>and you should move immediately, in 30 minutes, to get it, you will abandon this church.
    <br>Can you see: faith on possession.
    <br>You abandon the church, you go.
    <br>Remember, you are here today because you don't have so much "pressing issues" to attend to.
    <br>You are here today because you don't have an important engagement or issue to attend to.
    <br>That is why you come to church.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>If you have a very important issue to attend to;
    <br>somebody is ready to pay you the debt,
    <br>or the contract you have been looking for - they ask you to collect a document,
    <br>you would likely not come here.
    <br>Can you see: the world today has faith on the possession, not the Giver of that possession.
    <br>That is why the world is upside-down.
    <br>Our Christian life is rubbish.
    <br>Who is serving God?
    <br>We are serving possession.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Who is serving God? You are serving possession."
    <br>Look at the seats.
    <br>How many presidents are here with you?
    <br>How many governors are here with you?
    <br>How many ministers are here with you?
    <br>The same God that put them there...
    <br>When they were nobody, they were asking God, praying,
    <br>but when they get there, their time is so dear to spend with people.
    <br>House of God has now become insecure for them.
    <br>That is possession.
    <br>We are serving possession, we are no longer serving God.
    <br>People are no longer serving God.
    <br>People are no longer serving the Giver of possessions but serving possessions.
    <br>This is the cause of problems today.
    <br>Satan knows we are serving possessions and he keeps hitting our possessions.
    <br>Look at what God said to satan, when he came to God and said,
    <br>"Look, this Your man - they say he is a righteous man, a nice man. Will you allow me?";
    <br>and the Lord said, "You can strike anything but his heart.
    <br>Strike his possessions, but his heart - I will never..."
    <br>If you have faith in possessions, he has access to your possessions.
    <br>But if you have faith in the Giver of possessions, he has no access to your possessions.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"If you have faith in your possessions,
    <br>satan will have access to your possessions.
    <br>But if you have faith in the Giver of possessions,
    <br>satan cannot have access to your possessions."
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>Take it again.
    <br>If you have faith on your possessions,
    <br>satan will have access to your possessions.
    <br>God does not permit anyone to worship possessions but the Source.
    <br>You have faith in your possessions, your property, your money, your fame, even in yourself.
    <br>You, yourself also are a possession.
    <br>Only your heart...
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You are a possession".
    <br>You have faith in yourself - you have faith in your possessions.
    <br>Once you have faith in your possessions, satan will have access.
    <br>You have faith in yourself; that is why satan is attacking your health.
    <br>You will see; those things you love so much in your life - satan will attack it.
    <br>But when you have faith in the Giver of that possession, instead of possessions,
    <br>your possession will be under the refuge, cover.
    <br>I'm just telling you the secret because of trouble and challenges you are having today.
    <br>The world has that problem, because their faith is on the possessions, not the Giver of possessions.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>A VISIT TO ABRAHAM
    <br>If Abraham's faith was on his only son,
    <br>he would not have the courage to obey the instruction of God.
    <br>This is also what has happened to us in the house of God today.
    <br>We should trust in the authority of God not the majority;
    <br>the strength of the church is not its large numbers or size.
    <br>Some churches can have three members and they are more anointed than the biggest church.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>If your faith is lifted up, let me see your hand.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Brother, can you come and share with me what lesson you learned from this message?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I have learned to put my faith in God, not in possessions.
    <br>What are your possessions?
    <br>Everything, apart from my heart.
    <br>Everything!
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>He said, "Everything, apart from his heart,
    <br>where God dwells."
    <br>Our heart is the communication point.
    <br>This is why the Bible says faith is of man's heart.
    <br>Everything you can talk of, apart from the heart.
    <br>This is why God was warning satan when he said,
    <br>"I'm going to disturb this man" - "No, you can go and do whatever you want to do,
    <br>but his heart - don't go there! It is a sacred place."
    <br>It means every other thing is possession.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>So, as from today, how do you want to live your life?
    <br>I'm going to cultivate my heart more, keep it in the Word of God.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>If sickness comes, how will you handle your relationship with God?
    <br>I will continue to look upon God, if He doesn't heal me, I will continue to thank Him for that.
    <br>That is, if the sickness comes, it is a way of praying the more,
    <br>seeing the need of God the more, not to abandon your post.
    <br>When your faith is not on your possessions, satan will stop disturbing you.
    <br>He knows that this man's faith is not on his health or his property.
    <br>He will not go there and tamper with your property.
    <br>He is looking for where you put your faith on; he is fighting our faith.
    <br>"Where does this man put his faith? OK - his bank account."
    <br>He will go there and strike.
    <br>Because your faith is there, there is no protection for that bank account.
    <br>But if your faith is on God, the Giver of that bank account,
    <br>the Giver will protect the possession.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>We expose our possessions.
    <br>Our possessions are insecure because we put our faith on it.
    <br>The One to secure that possession is the One we should put our faith on.
    <br>Imagine, I give you something...
    <br>Come on, give me.
    <br>You ask me, "Please, give me this".
    <br>Please, give me that.
    <br>I now give you, you abandon me.
    <br>You now worship the thing you asked me to give you.
    <br>What do you think I will feel?
    <br>You will feel I was chasing you because of something that you had.
    <br>Bring it again - the two of them.
    <br>Begin to ask God.
    <br>Please, can I have it?
    <br>Now, you have it.
    <br>The time you used to have with me 24/7 when you were asking for this,
    <br>but now you have received this, you hardly have 2 hours with me.
    <br>Even these 2 hours are always in a hurry.
    <br>Bring it again, bring more, bring that bag.
    <br>I think we need to explain.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Now, I want to use this, so that you will understand what I'm talking about.
    <br>You are without - you have nothing,
    <br>and you want good health,
    <br>you want money, you want position, you want fame.
    <br>OK, which one do you want to ask God to give you?
    <br>Fame.
    <br>Pray!
    <br>Please, may I have fame?
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>Now, he doesn't need me anymore.
    <br>What he needed was fame, didn't he?
    <br>Now, he doesn't need me, until maybe he needs good health.
    <br>That is when he will call on me.
    <br>Now, he needs good health.
    <br>Instead of continuing to remember what I have given him...
    <br>Anytime he wants to pray for good health,
    <br>he has to remember, thank me for what I did for him, for giving him fame.
    <br>But he has forgotten about the fame; he needs good health.
    <br>Give me good health, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You see: What I have given him, he has forgotten about it.
    <br>He is asking for good health.
    <br>He has forgotten all together about fame.
    <br>It is like the blessing keeps taking our time off God.
    <br>This fame - you will begin to be popular, many people depend on you, you have a vehicle, trailer.
    <br>All these are possessions.
    <br>We seem to have faith on the possessions and forget the Giver.
    <br>That puts our possessions insecure.
    <br>Because the One to secure that possession is the One you have neglected,
    <br>you have failed to put your faith on Him.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>Your bag is blessed.
    <br>How To Handle HARD TIMES | TB Joshua
    <br>I want to believe that you quite understand the demonstration.
    <br>You have seen your wrong.
    <br>If you have seen your wrong, raise up your hand.
    <br>You know you are wrong - raise up your hand.
    <br>Say, "I'm wrong; oh Lord, help me".
    <br>You have seen your wrong now - we are wrong.
    <br>I want to leave you here.
    <br>Thank you.
