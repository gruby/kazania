  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers at home, wherever you are, we salute your faith.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>We continue to move according to the Spirit of God wave.
    <br>When He waves this direction, we follow; that direction, we follow.
    <br>That is the message you are receiving every week.
    <br>Like the issue of Holy Spirit - the Spirit of Father.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>If you don't know the Holy Spirit, you cannot know Jesus.
    <br>I know Jesus; I know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>If you don't know the Holy Spirit, you cannot know Jesus.
    <br>This is the issue we are going to talk about today.
    <br>Our title:
    <br>KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>Let someone say:
    <br>KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>If you say you know Jesus without knowing the Holy Spirit,
    <br>that is not Jesus in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>He is a Spirit and His worshippers must do so in spirit and truth.
    <br>What kind of Jesus are we talking about?
    <br>KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We take our text from various books:
    <br>1 Corinthians 2:1-end.
    <br>John 16 - you can take your reading from the beginning.
    <br>John 3:27 -
    <br>it will give you some clue of what we are about to talk about today.
    <br>2 Corinthians 5:7 - about faith.
    <br>2 Corinthians 4:18 - that one too will help you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's take our reading from the book of 1 Corinthians 2.
    <br>"And so it was with me, brothers and sisters. When I came to you,
    <br>I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God."
    <br>Verse 2.
    <br>"For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified."
    <br>Verse 3.
    <br>"I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling.
    <br>My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words,
    <br>but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power,"
    <br>Verse 5.
    <br>"so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God's power."
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>When you now go down, you will find God's wisdom revealed by the Spirit.
    <br>This is verse 6.
    <br>"We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature,
    <br>but not the wisom of this age or of the rulers of this age..."
    <br>Take your time to read to the end.
    <br>Many other books have been given to you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Taking your reading from verse 1 to the end of 1 Corinthians 2,
    <br>you will find that the Spirit is the organ by which we apprehend divine things;
    <br>man's spirit is dead because of sin.
    <br>The natural man - that is, the man of mind and the intellect - cannot understand
    <br>nor receive things of the Spirit.
    <br>Where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>And this is what is going on now; this is what is happening in our generation.
    <br>Things perish.
    <br>You cannot see satan in the natural.
    <br>I do not see satan in the natural; I see satan on the other side - spirit world.
    <br>This is why there is no vision - perish, destruction, killing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>I do not see satan in the natural; I see satan on the other side - the spirit world.
    <br>That is why the Bible says where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>satan ...
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>Where is no vision - perish.
    <br>What can you see here?
    <br>It is impossible to see what is here with your sight.
    <br>With your sight, it is impossible to see what is here.
    <br>Everyone is exposed to things that are not  consistent with God's Word.
    <br>If these things control your feelings and your feelings control your faith,
    <br>you can be a Christian yet controlled by satan's devices.
    <br>If these things control your feelings and your feelings control your faith,
    <br>you can be a Christian yet controlled by satan's devices.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>I do not see satan in the natural; I see satan on the other side - the spirit world.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>I do not see satan in the natural; I see satan on the other side - spirit world.
    <br>I am more comfortable walking in the Spirit because that is where I can hear Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>I am more comfortable walking in the Spirit because that is where I can hear Jesus.
    <br>- "T.B. Joshua!"
    <br>- "Yes, sir."
    <br>In the spirit.
    <br>But in the natural...
    <br>Can you see the life you live today?
    <br>I am more comfortable walking in the Spirit. That is where I can hear Jesus.
    <br>God gives us His Spirit to apprehend Him.
    <br>KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>Don't forget.
    <br>There has been a great mix-up in the Church.
    <br>It is the erroneous assumption that spiritual truths can be intellectually perceived.
    <br>It is possible to grow up in the Church as a baby -
    <br>your father is founder of this, founder of that church -
    <br>and learn all rites but not know Jesus because Jesus is not known by those external things.
    <br>Jesus is not known by those external things.
    <br>In John 16, it is perfectly plain that the Holy Spirit is the One that reveals Jesus to us.
    <br>You can read your New Testament and still never find Jesus in it.
    <br>You can be convinced that Jesus is the Son of God and still never find Jesus.
    <br>You can be a publisher of the Bible.
    <br>You can know about Christ dying for you.
    <br>You can head this or that religious organisation.
    <br>You can be the Founder and General Overseer
    <br>and still never know Jesus of Nazareth in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>In the Church, there are two Christs.
    <br>You need to know the one you are worshipping today.
    <br>There are two Christs:
    <br>1. The Christ of story and of history and song - the baby Jesus.
    <br>2. Then, there is this Christ which the Holy Spirit reveals.
    <br>Many people know about Christ but they don't know Christ.
    <br>There is a difference - knowing about Christ and knowing Christ.
    <br>John 3:27 - 'No man can receive except it is given from above'.
    <br>2 Timothy 3:16 - 'All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable'.
    <br>If you are reasoned into Christianity, some wise fellow can reason you out of it
    <br>unless you know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>If you are reasoned into Christianity without knowing the Holy Ghost -
    <br>and you become a Christian, claim you are a Christian without the Holy Ghost -
    <br>some wise fellow can reason you out of it - unless you know the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Knowing Jesus is knowing the Holy Ghost.
    <br>This is why you see people today, "I'm a member of this church" -
    <br>"Today, I don't want to go to church again".
    <br>"I used to be a Christian but no..."
    <br>"I'm this" - "No!"
    <br>"I'm a pastor" - "No, I'm no more"
    <br>"I'm an evangelist" - "No, I'm no more an evangelist"
    <br>Some wise fellow can reason you out if you are reasoned into Christianity.
    <br>Why? Because Christianity falls or stands on Christ Jesus,
    <br>stands or falls on the illumination of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>It is either the Holy Spirit or darkness.
    <br>It is either the Holy Ghost or darkness.
    <br>The Holy Ghost is God's imperative of life.
    <br>If our faith is to be a New Testament faith, if Jesus Christ is to be the Christ of God
    <br>rather than the Christ of history or story, the illumination of the Holy Ghost will tell our heart
    <br>that we are learning at Jesus' feet, not at man's feet.
    <br>Are you...
    <br>No, what I'm saying does not demand for applause.
    <br>It demands for crying.
    <br>Sober reflection because I don't see Christians among you.
    <br>I'm seeing religious people sitting down.
    <br>So why are you clapping?
    <br>I cannot see Christians among you.
    <br>I'm seeing religious people sitting down.
    <br>As it should be - the way your forefathers were having God,
    <br>the way your father is praying and fasting,
    <br>that is the way you are going about serving God.
    <br>The Christ of history, story, song - baby Jesus.
    <br>Who is a Christian among us?
    <br>If you are a Christian, can you tell me who is talking to you?
    <br>Are you seeing beyond me? - That is what you call Christian.
    <br>If you are a Christian, you live by the Holy Ghost; you would be able to see beyond me.
    <br>You can't see beyond me; you only see me talking to you.
    <br>That is all you see.
    <br>That is why you can go out when you decide to; you can do anything.
    <br>That is why tomorrow you may not come to church if you are not healed or blessed
    <br>because you are reasoned into Christianity.
    <br>If today is your last day, where are you going?
    <br>Is there any kingdom for religious (people)?
    <br>Thy Kingdom come; Thy will be done.
    <br>Where are you going if today is your last day?
    <br>You will tell Jesus, "Im a member of this church; I go to church" -
    <br>is that the excuse you want to give?
    <br>I can't see Christians among you.
    <br>We continue the journey.
    <br>This is the message God asked me to give you.
    <br>KNOWING JESUS, KNOWING THE HOLY SPIRIT
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you are not filled with the Spirit, you cannot obey the written Word.
    <br>That is the painful part.
    <br>You are just carrying the Bible and you are  just reading the history part of it
    <br>because there is no way you can obey the Word of God if you are not filled.
    <br>That is the most painful part of it.
    <br>Where is your Bible?
    <br>See. This one - you cannot obey it.
    <br>You will just be reading it as a religious man.
    <br>You read to preach, teach it but to live it - it is not possible.
    <br>If you cannot obey the Scripture, you quench God.
    <br>You quench Him.
    <br>That is the most painful part.
    <br>Reading the Bible, carrying the Bible...
    <br>The Word here is not just history; the Holy Spirit carried the writers along.
    <br>That is the most painful thing - very, very painful.
    <br>Many of you have read this Bible four to five times.
    <br>We have many publishers here - publishers of the Bible.
    <br>They are among you that publish the Bible for daily bread.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>That is the most painful part of it.
    <br>The most painful part of it - I mean the Bible is irrelevant to you.
    <br>I will be stretching my hand now; you will see people shaking
    <br>but you don't know what is shaking them.
    <br>The resurrection power that flows within me to them -
    <br>you cannot see it but you always see people shaking and falling.
    <br>It becomes a magic to you.
    <br>"Ah! What is this? Without touching, what is making people to fall?"
    <br>You can't see because you are not filled.
    <br>Through that, it is blaspheming.
    <br>You will not say it out but your heart is saying a lot.
    <br>Your heart is saying a lot; your heart is blaspheming.
    <br>Your heart is not at rest.
    <br>You keep blaspheming; you keep seeing what you do not understand.
    <br>Your heart will blaspheme.
    <br>This is the problem we find ourselves in.
    <br>I will stand here to tell you, "Don't go to that church".
    <br>Why should I say that you should not go there?
    <br>If you go there, you will be able to see more.
    <br>Seeing more will help your history.
    <br>It will make you adequate in serving God.
    <br>If that church is not good, go there. See for yourself.
    <br>If you have not seen enough darkness, you cannot appreciate light.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Please.
    <br>You are not serving God without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>If you are serving God without the Holy Spirit, you are serving a god you do not know.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>If I serve God without the Holy Ghost, I am serving a god I do not know.
    <br>It is the Spirit that makes us know Him.
    <br>Serving God without the Holy Spirit is serving a god you do not know.
    <br>This is the god our forefathers served and this is the life you are living today.
    <br>Someone keeps telling you what God says.
    <br>Someone keeps telling you, "God says you should sleep".
    <br>That is the life you want to live throughout.
    <br>"God says you should sleep."
    <br>"God says you should wake up."
    <br>"God says you should fast."
    <br>"God says you should do this; God says you should go to London."
    <br>Is that the life you want to live throughout?
    <br>It means you are still serving a god you do not know.
    <br>Someone is telling you what God says.
    <br>It means you do not know that god; that is why someone is telling you.
    <br>For how long?
    <br>Very, very painful.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Very, very painful".
    <br>Very, very painful.
    <br>That is the way I see it.
    <br>Very, very ... painful.
    <br>Intellectually perceived.
    <br>Spiritual truth - we can intellectually perceive it.
    <br>Very, very painful - you have to get out of this.
    <br>Forget about your problem.
    <br>You don't have a problem; that is the only problem you have.
    <br>Every other problem is not a problem.
    <br>The greatest problem is for you to serve a god you do not know.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>The greatest problem - all other are not problems.
    <br>The greatest problem is to serve a god you do not know.
    <br>Imagine your age today - how old are you?
    <br>You have been serving God...
    <br>You have a dream - you have to consult somebody to tell you the meaning.
    <br>You have a job - you want to know whether it is a good job.
    <br>You want to marry - you carry it medically to know whether it is good;
    <br>spiritually, you run from one place to another to know whether it is the right thing.
    <br>This is the life you have been living.
    <br>And such life is not profitable.
    <br>A man cannot receive except it is given from above.
    <br>But you keep receiving from people.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>You say you are poor; you are not poor.
    <br>You say you are sick; you are not sick.
    <br>You are only serving a god you do not know.
    <br>If you are blessed today and you still continue serving a god you do not know,
    <br>you will still come back poorer - unless you serve God you know.
