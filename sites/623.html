  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, when I say 'Church', I mean you. I mean everyone.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We received a lot of questions and I asked my people to bring these questions out
    <br>so that we can read them one by one.
    <br>After we have read them, we decided to pick from two sections -
    <br>one that is very touching.
    <br>There is a question concerning the message that is being shown on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>It was a man or was it a woman? It should be a woman because you know our women.
    <br>They normally want to know.
    <br>She was asking, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray...".
    <br>It's a very funny question.
    <br>It's very interesting.
    <br>She said, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray...".
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>This is very spiritual.
    <br>She said, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray...".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray...".
    <br>After looking at that question, I will not be able to go through it.
    <br>I just want to give you a summary of the importance of this question.
    <br>When you are praying - even before  you pray - you know the outcome, answer -
    <br>it's much greater than blessings.
    <br>Our mother that asked this question, please listen to that; for you to know how important it is.
    <br>To know that God hears us when we pray
    <br>is much greater than blessings, healing, deliverance and breakthough.
    <br>If you can hear from God, you will know when to pray and what to ask for.
    <br>But today how many of us...
    <br>You can't hear anything from God.
    <br>Because you say you are a Christian, that is why you pray.
    <br>I mean because you claim you are a Christian that is why you pray.
    <br>You have seen prayer as a tradition, national anthem; this is the way you see prayer.
    <br>Even coming to church, you see it as a tradition. On Sunday, I must go to church.
    <br>Not that anything attached to it.
    <br>Take note of this question: To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray.
    <br>It is much greater than anything.
    <br>When you want to pray, you say, "Heal me, heal me!"
    <br>No. It is much greater to know whether you will be healed.
    <br>"Bless me, oh Lord, bless me!"
    <br>There is something greater than that blessing.
    <br>If you know God will bless you, it is much greater than the blessing you are asking for.
    <br>"Deliver me, Lord, deliver me!"
    <br>There is something greater than that deliverance.
    <br>To know that God will deliver you is even greater than the blessing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again, "To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray
    <br>is much greater than blessing, deliverance and healing".
    <br>How many of us know this today?
    <br>We always base our faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>You base your faith on your improvement after prayer.
    <br>When you want to pray, you say, "Jesus, heal me, Jesus heal me".
    <br>When you are not healed, you say, "I have no faith that is why Jesus did not heal me.
    <br>Jesus, heal me. Jesus, heal me".
    <br>When you experience little relief, you say, "That is the level of my faith".
    <br>Oh my God. If I am talking to you, let me see your hand!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are having headache. You say, "Jesus, heal me, heal me".
    <br>When you are not healed, you say, "No faith".
    <br>You always base you faith on your  improvement after prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You always base you faith on your  improvement after prayer".
    <br>That is it.
    <br>You always base you faith on your  improvement after prayer.
    <br>When you have not improved, you say, "I have no faith; that is why I have not improved".
    <br>When you have a little, you are praying you want to meet a customer who promised to give you money.
    <br>As a Christian, you now say, "Lord...".
    <br>You have been fasting for three days because you want to meet the man who promised to give you money.
    <br>Fasting for three days; praying, "Lord, touch his heart".
    <br>Now, it is time to go and meet the man.
    <br>You just get to the door and he says, "Please who is knocking on the door?"
    <br>You say, "I am the one".
    <br>He says, "Please I dont want to hear your voice".
    <br>You say "Ah, I have no faith".
    <br>When you continue to base your faith on your improvement after prayer,
    <br>you will soon become unbelievers.
    <br>Because that is the trick satan is using now; a common trick today,
    <br>a common strategy and tactic of satan.
    <br>He has been using it to draw you closer to him.
    <br>Each time you say, "Jesus, I am hungry" - instead of you to know that
    <br>when He doesn't give you food instantly, it does not mean you are not a child of God.
    <br>When He doesn't give you food instantly, it does not mean you have no faith.
    <br>But you say, "I'm not a child of God that is why the food is not given to me".
    <br>Now because of that you begin to see Jesus in a bad light.
    <br>Then, you'll now begin to see satan; you are going back to satan.
    <br>This is what turned you to what you are today.
    <br>You are what you are because you base your faith on your improvement after prayer.
    <br>Tell you neighbour, "You are what you are today because you base your faith on your improvement after prayer".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Say "I am what I am because I base my faith on my improvement after prayer".
    <br>You keep drawing closer to Satan, and your Christian life keeps going down.
    <br>You keep counting how many failures you have in prayer.
    <br>I asked for this; I didn't receive it.
    <br>I asked for promotion; I received a sack letter.
    <br>Now, I am asking God to give me another job; I am jobless now.
    <br>By the time you now count the number of failures in your prayer,
    <br>you are about to begin to pray to satan.
    <br>You go to witchdoctors, spiritualists.
    <br>You now believe that maybe you have to do the two together.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have to do the two together.
    <br>You now begin to listen to the voice of your neighbours who say, "Ah, where is your car?"
    <br>He is making jest of you. He knows you have a jeep you normally ride to church.
    <br>He now sees you with a Bible without a car, walking on the street.
    <br>"Oga, where is your car?"
    <br>"It is with the mechanics".
    <br>"Ok, ok. Because I have seen you...".
    <br>For how long will you continue to tell your neighbour, it's with the mechanics.
    <br>At the end of the day, you'll open the door, open your window,
    <br>look around. When your neighbour is not around, you run.
    <br>Your big Bible now turns to a small Bible that you can put in your pocket.
    <br>They will not know where you are going.
    <br>You are what you are because you base your faith on your improvement.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You now have a small Bible that you can put inside your pocket.
    <br>When you do not carry a Bible, your neighbour cannot ask you where you are going.
    <br>Sometimes, you wear a T-shirt and put your suit inside (a bag).
    <br>I don't want them to know where I am going.
    <br>These two issues are very important that the woman asked me.
    <br>I know that she is being used mightily by God in asking me,
    <br>"To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray is much greater than anything".
    <br>If you know you hear from God after prayer, you will not be disappointed
    <br>because when you come to Him, He will tell you what you want to ask for is not His will.
    <br>We always ask for something against  God's will.
    <br>If you pray according to His will, you will receive.
    <br>Look at me. I am having this.
    <br>It is my intention to give it to you.
    <br>And you now come to me, "T.B. Joshua, give me". I will give it to you.
    <br>But this one is not for you.
    <br>You now come to me and begin to pray, "T.B. Joshua, give me".
    <br>Ah. It is not for you. If I give it to you, it will destroy you.
    <br>If I give it to you, it will terminate your life.
    <br>If I give it to you, it will take you away from Christian life.
    <br>He will not give it to you.
    <br>Sometimes, those prayers are meant to strengthen your desire.
    <br>Unanswered prayers are meant to strengthen your desire;
    <br>they are meant to stop you awhile in order to prepare you better.
    <br>They are not unanswered prayers.
    <br>They seem unanswered but they are not.
    <br>To base your prayer on your improvement after prayer is nonsense.
    <br>You say, "Jesus, give me bread" and you are not given, you feel faithless.
    <br>I don't have faith.
    <br>And that will not encourage you to continue striving.
    <br>Today, we seem to listen to what people complain and pray over it,
    <br>instead of listening to what God says we should pray for.
    <br>We should listen to God, "In the name of Jesus, this man is asking for prayer -
    <br>what kind of prayer will I offer for him?"
    <br>But since we cannot reach God and we have no access to God,
    <br>we tend to listen to what you people demand for.
    <br>You ask for bread - "In the name of Jesus, God, give bread".
    <br>"God, give him bread."
    <br>Instead of asking God.
    <br>This man is asking for prayer.
    <br>It may be biscuit that God wants us to give to this man instead of bread.
    <br>And that biscuit will contain the bread you are asking for.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>These are the challenges we are having today.
    <br>What you do today - "Man of God, pray for me".
    <br>Even some of us will go ahead to ask, "What is your problem?"
    <br>"My marital life is destroyed."
    <br>"Ok. Father, Father, bring this man and this woman together. Let them come together.
    <br>What you have joined together, no one should put asunder, in Jesus' name."
    <br>No answer because we listened to the patient instead of listening to God.
    <br>We cannot order God; God orders us.
    <br>But today, we order God.
    <br>By listening to the patient - "I have marital problem" - and I start praying over that marital problem,
    <br>we are ordering God.
    <br>How do we know that this is the will of God for the woman?
    <br>We should pray according to His will.
    <br>When you are not praying according to His will, you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>When we pray according to His will, He answers us.
    <br>We need to ask God's will over issues.
    <br>You are very poor, you have debt and you run to me,
    <br>"Man of God, I have debt, I have no money. Pray for me. I have debt. I have no house".
    <br>Now, instead of asking God - God's will over the matter -
    <br>and God's will may be, "Pray for the man against sickness",
    <br>not even what the man asked for,
    <br>that prayer alone will solve all other problems.
    <br>But we go ahead to pray according to the man's will.
    <br>The man demanded for breakthrough and we begin to pray, "Breakthrough, breakthrough".
    <br>You cannot order God; God orders us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And we too - members, subjects, patients - you people have constituted temptations.
    <br>You tempt your pastor; you tempt everyone because you are ignorant.
    <br>What do you expect from an ignorant person?
    <br>There's nothing an ignorant person cannot do
    <br>because you don't even know 1,2,3 in things of the spirit.
    <br>Tempter.
    <br>When you just get to your pastor, "Man of God, my business is not moving".
    <br>Now, you are a tempter.
    <br>Man of God himself - ignorant.
    <br>He does not even know how to go about it.
    <br>He wants to pray over your business instead of asking God - God's will.
    <br>When we pray according to His will, He answers us.
    <br>Not according to your will.
    <br>Not according to the will of the patient.
    <br>This is quiet different from a medical issue.
    <br>When you have a problem and you go to the doctor, you help the doctor.
    <br>Oftentimes, we help the doctor. How?
    <br>You say, "I have a problem, doctor".
    <br>He will ask you, "What is your problem?"
    <br>"Chronic headache."
    <br>Now, you are helping the doctor.
    <br>He will now focus on that X-ray to see your head.
    <br>But if your doctor cannot find anything, he will still go an extra mile
    <br>to check other faculties or organs of your system,
    <br>to know where the problem comes from.
    <br>If he cannot find the problem, he will say, "Ah, I cannot trace anything now".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Which is quite different from God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All of us have become a tempter to God because of our ignorance.
    <br>When the name of Jesus has not answered, we say, "It doesn't work for me".
    <br>And the name of Jesus is alive.
    <br>When we call that name and he has not answered us, we think that it doesn't work for us.
    <br>Some ignorant people would say, "No, he is not alive. There is nothing like that".
    <br>But those who want to be mine will say, "It doesn't work for me".
    <br>It means they still believe that it works for some people.
    <br>When you meet your pastor tomorrow for an issue, how do you approach it now?
    <br>You say, "Pastor, my business is not moving. Pray for me".
    <br>You have become a tempter; tempting the pastor.
    <br>The pastor too is not supposed to pray over that issue.
    <br>He is supposed to ask God - God's will.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your business not moving may be to preserve you for some days or months.
    <br>God can use your business, the slowing down of your business, to preserve you.
    <br>He can use the failure of your business to preserve you.
    <br>He will preserve you.
    <br>If your business is moving and you are travelling all over, maybe something would have happened to you.
    <br>Maybe you would have ended your life suddently just like that.
    <br>But instead of allowing your business to move and you ending your life,
    <br>He will slow down the business so that you will not be able to travel to where satan will catch you.
    <br>If I am talking to you, let me see your hand!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you are destined for Heaven and Heaven is your home, God has a way of stopping you.
    <br>Even if you live in the clubhouse 24/7 and you are in the clubhouse dancing naked
    <br>and do all sorts of things, and Heaven is your home, He has a way of stopping you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He has a way of stopping you so that you can inherit the Kingdom.
    <br>He can use any foolish thing; He can use anything.
    <br>He can use failure; he can even use cancer.
    <br>When you dance naked, have cancer and get to the doctor, the doctor says, "This is cancer.
    <br>You have seven days left to spend on this earth".
    <br>You say, "Doctor, what will I do?" Nobody wants to die.
    <br>"What will I do?"
    <br>He says, "You smoke too much. Where are you working?"
    <br>"I'm in the clubhouse."
    <br>"Ah, stop that. Stop smoking. Ok? Look onto God."
    <br>"If I do that, I will not die?"
    <br>"You will not die. Your life will still be prolonged."
    <br>"Ok."
    <br>You stop smoking, you stop nonsense, you come back.
    <br>When you come back - what kind of cancer? Your cancer is not like others!
    <br>Those for whom God uses those foolish things to preserve, their own foolish thing is not like others.
    <br>Their own sickness is to kill or destroy them but yours is to preserve you.
    <br>Are you getting me?
    <br>When I say foolish things, I mean all kind of nonsense like cancer, sickness, poverty
    <br>failure, embarassment, temptation.
    <br>If you are destined for Heaven and Heaven is your home at last, you cannot lose it.
    <br>When you are going astray, He will use anything to stop you in order not to lose Heaven.
    <br>Listen. He can use death. You hear of people dying suddently.
    <br>Sometimes, He uses death to stop the life of that person.
    <br>Whilst that person is about to die, he will say, "God, I am sorry".
    <br>He will give the chance to say that.
    <br>"I am sorry."
    <br>He may give two, three or four days, or even just an hour or second for you to say, "I'm sorry" -
    <br>he is going to Heaven.
    <br>But you people will be shouting, "Heee, he died at a young age. Why did this happen?
    <br>Why should all these things happen? This satanic world! This is it".
    <br>Sit down there. You will meet him in Heaven.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sit down and think about your business, the challenges you are facing now.
    <br>It is better that you change.
    <br>Heaven is your home.
    <br>You say, "My business is not going well" and you begin to attribute it to satan.
    <br>Who is satan in your life when you are a child of God?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My business is not moving. I have debts.
    <br>Look at me from up down; look at what's happening to me.
    <br>This is an embarrassment. You start thinking that it's satan who is behind it.
    <br>Which satan when you are destined for Heaven and you are going astray?
    <br>In order not to lose Heaven, something has to stop you
    <br>so that you can look inward and do the right thing.
    <br>If your spirit is telling you that you are destined for Heaven, let me see your hand.
    <br>You will know inside you, the indwelling grace is telling you that you are destined for Heaven.
    <br>No matter - you are destined for Heaven.
    <br>Let me see your hand.
    <br>Rise up!
    <br>My lifetime.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My lifetime
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>My lifetime
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>If I give God my lifetime
    <br>He will take care of me
    <br>He will never ever let me down
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>My lifetime
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>My lifetime
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>If I give God my lifetime
    <br>He will take care of me
    <br>He will never ever let me down
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>That you have sickness, does not mean you are not a favourite.
    <br>Don't ever judge your Christian life by your situation.
    <br>In the same vein, don't ever base your faith on your improvement after prayer.
    <br>Repeat after me: "Don't ever judge your Christian life by your situation.
    <br>In the same vein, don't ever base your faith on your improvement after prayer".
    <br>Soldier on - you are a Christian.
    <br>You pray and you are expecting something and you are not receiving that thing - soldier on!
    <br>That should be the reason why you should love Jesus the more.
    <br>Jesus said, "If you honour me when your situation seems to be very hopeless,
    <br>I will honour you mightily!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you honour me when your situation seems hopeless,
    <br>He said, I will honour you mightily!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When a situation happens ... people around say, "Are you a Christian?
    <br>Why are all these things happening to you?"
    <br>If in the midst this, you start to honour Jesus and say, "Yes, I am a Christian"
    <br>and you love Jesus the more, the reward is greater.
    <br>When there is no testimony and you honour Him, you are dancing,
    <br>you honour Him even more than those that have testimony - the greater is your reward!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These are the things satan uses to destroy the life of people today.
    <br>Look at the question this woman is asking me:
    <br>"To learn how to know that God hears us when we pray".
    <br>I have answered the woman: "... is much greater than the blessing we are seeking".
    <br>How do you learn this now?
    <br>To learn these things - these are the things I am giving you now - the experiences;
    <br>what Satan is using on the outside to deceive you.
    <br>When you have sickness, he now says, "Aha, he is sick now!"
    <br>He is happy.
    <br>Do you know why Satan is happy when you are sick?
    <br>Because he knows that you will begin to confess him.
    <br>How do we confess satan?
    <br>We confess satan when we start running to spiritualists.
    <br>"Hehehe, no food on the table!" Satan says, "Hehe, this is what I want".
    <br>He is waiting. Why is he laughing?
    <br>He is laughing because he knows what you will begin to confess.
    <br>"Church? No, I am not going to church."
    <br>You are confessing satan.
    <br>Reading Bible - hm.
    <br>You normally pray three times a day. You reduce it to just once.
    <br>It is confessing satan.
    <br>He knows he is getting to you gradually, gradually, gradually
    <br>and he knows that soon, you will turn to him and worship him.
    <br>Thank You.
