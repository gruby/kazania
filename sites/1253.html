    <br>Viewers, pain of the past - let us be careful.
    <br>If I had been holding the pain of the past, you would not be able to come to me today.
    <br>You know how many prayers you have offered to bind and loose me in your various homes.
    <br>Here today, if you were to call people that had been praying in the past -
    <br>if I had been holding that pain of the past, I don't know who would come to me today
    <br>but here we are today.
    <br>The Lord says, "I will set a table before you in the presence of your enemies".
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pain of the past - be careful because of each day's grace.
    <br>Say, "Each day's grace!"
    <br>Today's grace is quite different from yesterday's grace,
    <br>and today's grace is quite different from tomorrow's grace.
    <br>Each day's grace.
    <br>We are living a life of carry-over.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Stop living a life of carry-over".
    <br>'Carry-over' means, what you would have finished -
    <br>once you wake up, forget about the rest.
    <br>You can only remember those things that glorify Jesus, the rest - forget.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning on your knees, you say,
    <br>"Lord Jesus, thank You Lord, for giving me the grace to wake up".
    <br>Forget about anything that does not glorify Jesus,
    <br>pain of the past, injustice - put it behind.
    <br>Think about only those things that glorify Jesus because each day has grace.
    <br>This is what is holding you.
    <br>Carry-over.
    <br>In the university, once you have a carry-over, you will know it's a stigma.
    <br>No matter how brilliant you are, it's a stigma.
    <br>Stigma that you go back to your junior for a lecture,
    <br>andalso come back to have a lecture with your mate.
    <br>Are you senior or junior?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It's a stigma.
    <br>You live yesterday and you live today - what kind of life is that?
    <br>You live in the past, you live in the present - what kind of life is that?
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are released from the pain of the past!
    <br>Begin to fix your life right now, fix your life.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Your life is fixed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your business is fixed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your career is fixed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Whatever area you have challenges, be it your health -
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Wherever that sickness is located - you are cured, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Repentance means being sorry for sin.
    <br>If you have sympathy for sin, the Lord will not hear your prayer.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You just need to release anything that has to do with the past, that does not glorify God.
    <br>Holding offence, injustice someone has done to you, pain of the past -
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can sense God's deliverance touching you.
    <br>Agree with me.
    <br>This is what I am seeing going on now - Someone is touching you.
    <br>Somebody touched me
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>When I was praying
    <br>Praying to my Father
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>I can sense God's deliverance touching you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every shameful thing, be delivered, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Sickness, disease - be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Very shameful thing - Christians believe when a Christian is sick,
    <br>they can only disclose their sickness to a doctor.
    <br>Their Christian brother, they say, "No. I'm ok".
    <br>A Christian can be sick, and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>Healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>You can be sick and yet be a friend of God,
    <br>be a candidate of Heaven.

    <br>I can sense God's deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In His presence, we are content!
    <br>In Your presence I am content
    <br>In Your presence there is love
    <br>Expressions of Your love
    <br>And revelations of Your power and might
    <br>In Your presence I can bring
    <br>A love song offering
    <br>I'm in the presence of my King
    <br>In His presence, there healing is,
    <br>there deliverance is.
    <br>I can sense God's deliverance on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>God's healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I still see some people are struggling o understand what we are talking about,
    <br>struggling with faith.
    <br>This can be caused by unclean spirits.
    <br>All unclean spirits operating in their lives - leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You unclean spirits operating in their lives - leave, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can feel it - the presence of God is awesome.
    <br>I see people being healed; I see people being delivered.
    <br>I see people being healed; I see people being free.
    <br>Receive your breakthrough, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>Yes, breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough - that is God for you!
    <br>Do you believe that you are in the presence of God?
    <br>Begin to fix your life right now!
