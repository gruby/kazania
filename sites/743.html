    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Early one morning, at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>this young lady arrived at the church gate in a wheelchair accompanied by her mother,
    <br>in desperate need of assistance.
    <br>Immediately responding to their cry for help,
    <br>the Emmanuel TV team interviewed them to find out what the problem was,
    <br>that had brought them all the way from Germany.
    <br>The young lady was brought into the church auditorium in a wheelchair,
    <br>unable to move around freely and accompanied by her mother.
    <br>She showed the team her identity card from Germany stating that she has been recognized,
    <br>by the German government as a disabled person.
    <br>The card reads, "The holder of this card is severely disabled."
    <br>Her mother also shows the team her daughter's medical report stating that she  has been diagnosed,
    <br>with severe multiple sclerosis. Let's listen to them.
    <br>Good morning, I'm Marefe Wezolek and this is my daughter, Nicole Wezolek.
    <br>We come from Germany.
    <br>We were told that there will be a lot of people and we didn't want to be in the crowd.
    <br>That is why we came her earlier; we woke up at 2 o'clock and at 3 o'clock we started to come here.
    <br>So what is the problem that brought you here?
    <br>For one year, my daughter has been disabled.
    <br>She's using a wheelchair; she cannot do anything.
    <br>I must help her to either wash, cook her food and do everything.
    <br>She is 80 percent disabled.
    <br>She tried to look at the internet and she found The SCOAN.
    <br>That is why I have faith that she can be healed.
    <br>We can see that you have a document in front of you.
    <br>Can you please explain for us what this document says?
    <br>She has multiple sclerosis and it is becoming worse.
    <br>So because of the problem of multiple sclerosis,
    <br>your daughter has been using a wheelchair for the past year?
    <br>Yes, for a period of one year.
    <br>It started with numbness in her hands and then it spread over her whole body.
    <br>She cannot walk anymore without light.
    <br>She stumbled a lot of times on our staircase.
    <br>That was why we started to look for a solution.
    <br>This is a card for disabled people and it states that she is 80 percent disabled.
    <br>The "B" means she cannot do anything, without somebody assisting her.
    <br>She must use a wheelchair.
    <br>She is 80 percent disabled.
    <br>Can you tell us, how did you hear about The SCOAN and what prompted you to come?
    <br>She was the one who discovered The SCOAN through the internet and she told me about the ministry.
    <br>So, I watched the ministry's YouTube videos every day.
    <br>I have faith that Prophet T.B. Joshua is a man of God.
    <br>The disease is incurable; and it is getting worse every day.
    <br>I started to worry and that was why I said we should save money
    <br>to go to The SCOAN as fast as possible.
    <br>Hi! My name is Nicole Wezolek from Germany.
    <br>Can you please explain the problem that has brought you to The SCOAN today, so early this morning?
    <br>I am sick. I am disabled and I cannot walk; I use this wheelchair.
    <br>I searched on the internet and saw that 
    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua can do everything with God.
    <br>So, I chose to come here.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty will heal you today during the service,
    <br>as the man of God comes to this service, in Jesus' Name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>During The SCOAN Sunday Service, God uses Prophet T.B. Joshua to minister
    <br>prophecy, healing and deliverance to the people.
    <br>Among them is Nicole Wezolek and
    <br>her mother.
    <br>Prompted by the Holy Spirit, Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for her divine healing in Jesus' name.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>There is a suicide spirit in the family.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Everybody thinks of how to commit suicide.
    <br>Depression.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>This one has it.
    <br>It is the second time she has escaped suicide.
    <br>Yes, it is true.
    <br>There was a time she set everything down to commit suicide.
    <br>She told me.
    <br>She told you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I thank God and praise Him through Prophet T.B. Joshua for the deliverance and healing.
    <br>That's why we are here today, to testify to the goodness of God.
    <br>I am Marefe Wezolek from Germany.
    <br>This is my daughter Nicole.
    <br>Last week, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied that in the family, there was a spirit of depression and suicide.
    <br>That is true because when I was pregnant, I sensed this spirit always following me.
    <br>I was alone but I prayed to God.
    <br>It was only a few years ago that I detected that it was in the family with the children growing up.
    <br>We would quarrel and have misunderstandings in the family.
    <br>My daughter started to wear black clothes and separated from the group.
    <br>I could not understand her - that's why I prayed to God.
    <br>Just a year ago, she told me that she had numbness in her hands.
    <br>In one year, what started in the hands spread to the whole body - 100 percent numbness.
    <br>She could not walk. We went from 
    <br>one doctor to another.
    <br>She had infusions of cortisone.
    <br>Because of the last infusion, she was already
    <br>very sad and afraid of another infusion.
    <br>So, I said that this is a time you have to pray to God for guidance.
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>Madam, after the man of God gave the message of prophecy concerning your daughter,
    <br>tell us what happened next.
    <br>After the prophecy and the deliverance, the effect was immediate.
    <br>She told me, "Mama, I can sense already. I can feel my hands and feet, and I can walk!
    <br>Praise God!" I was shocked
    <br>because she was healed instantly.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Before, she was wearing black clothes and going to the graveyard almost every day.
    <br>I asked her why and sensed that it was no longer normal;
    <br>that's why I prayed that God would guide her.
    <br>Was she cheerful, how did she relate with you as a mother and people around the community?
    <br>There was no good communication in the house; there were always misunderstandings.
    <br>Since after the prophecy and deliverance last Sunday, can you tells us the changes
    <br>you have seen in her attitude, and approach to people?
    <br>There are very big changes, physically and spiritually.
    <br>Is she happier now?
    <br>She's happy not only because of the healing but also because of the Spirit-filled environment.
    <br>Hallelujah! Once again, let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Nicole Wezolek from Germany and this is my mother.
    <br>T.B. Joshua prophesied to me last Sunday
    <br>that I had a suicidal spirit inside me
    <br>and depression, which was also in the family.
    <br>That was true because I wanted to kill myself two times but I didn't do it.
    <br>I had numbness all over my body; I couldn't feel my body anymore.
    <br>I couldn't walk; I had to use the wheelchair.
    <br>After T.B. Joshua touched me, I can feel and walk again.
    <br>It was so nice. I thank T.B. Joshua for 
    <br>this amazing gift.
    <br>I thank God for the wonderful miracle.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Nicole Wezolek & Mother
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>I was very depressed and sad all the time;
    <br>I didn't know why.
    <br>I thought people were angry with me but it was not so.
    <br>I am now happy that I can walk and feel again.
    <br>What about the numbness you used to feel?
    <br>The numbness is gone; I can feel my body one hundred percent!
    <br>Thank God! Praise God!
    <br>Wow! Let us clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>The next day, Nicole Wezolek and her mother came back to The SCOAN to testify to her instant healing
    <br>from the problem of severe multiple sclerosis that had confined her to a wheelchair.
    <br>Nicole Wezolek
    <br>Healed Of Multiple Sclerosis In Jesus' Name
    <br>No Longer Uses A Wheelchair
    <br>My name is Nicole Wezolek and I'm from Germany.
    <br>Could you please tell us the problem that 
    <br>brought you here to The SCOAN?
    <br>I came here because I was disabled 
    <br>and I could not walk.
    <br>I used a wheelchair before.
    <br>So, before you came here, you had to make use of this wheelchair to be able to move around?
    <br>Yes, of course.
    <br>Last Sunday, I was sitting there and my mother sitting on the next chair.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua came and prophesied that I had a spirit of suicide in my body.
    <br>He touched me and healed me, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Since then, I can walk.
    <br>I can feel everything in my body.
    <br>Before, I had numbness of my whole body
    <br>but now, I have feeling.
    <br>I no longer have to use this wheelchair.
    <br>Wow! So, you mean to say that you no longer need to use this wheelchair at all?
    <br>That you're completely healed in Jesus' name.
    <br>Yes, I no longer have to use this anymore.
    <br>I can walk!
    <br>So you mean to say that you no longer have those
    <br>suicidal thoughts anymore?
    <br>No, it's gone.
    <br>Amen. We thank God for this wonderful healing and deliverance that you have received.
    <br>Proving her complete healing, Nicole excitedly runs and jumps;
    <br>the numbness and pains are things of the past.
    <br>When Jesus Christ heals you, He heals you effectually.
    <br>He heals you completely.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I am healed!
    <br>I thank God for healing my daughter.
    <br>I don't have to assist or help her anymore.
    <br>We don't need this wheelchair anymore.
    <br>I thank God for the deliverance and healing
    <br>through Prophet T.B Joshua.
    <br>To all the staff of the SCOAN -
    <br>thank you very much!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>After giving her awesome testimony,
    <br>Nicole Wezolek and her mother prepare to embark on their journey back to Germany.
    <br>Let's listen to them as they share their experience.
    <br>My name is Marefe Wezolek. I'm a professional nurse.
    <br>Today, we are leaving here for Germany.
    <br>This is my daughter Nicole Wezolek.
    <br>We are happy for everything - 
    <br>for the healing and deliverance.
    <br>Thank you so much. Praise God!
    <br>Mrs Marefe Wezolek & Daughter
    <br>Germany
    <br>The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua said that we should present you with this cash gift of 2000 USD
    <br>to support you and your daughter.
    <br>Oh my God! I am overwhelmed.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>I didn't expect it.
    <br>Thank you very much, Prophet Joshua.
    <br>It's overwhelming!
    <br>This is for you and your daughter, to support your daughter from here on out.
    <br>In addition to that, the man of God also said we should present you with these five Morning Waters
    <br>and two booklets so you can continue to pray and minister it, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We believe the best is yet to come.
    <br>Thank you very much!
    <br>Praise God! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
