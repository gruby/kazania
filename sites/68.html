    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Whatever sickness, whatever disease or whatever name they call it,
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot heal,
    <br>never a disease Jesus cannot cure,
    <br>never a burden Jesus cannot bear.

    <br>from the adversary, right now, be washed away, by the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>Be flushed out, by the Blood of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Right now, I can hear people shouting, "Hallelujah, I'm healed!"
    <br>People are shouting, "Hallelujah, I'm healed, I'm delivered!"
    <br>"I'm delivered!"
    <br>I say to you, viewers all over the world, once again, begin to break generational curses!
