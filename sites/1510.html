  <p>    
    <br>My name is Evangelist Osuri.
    <br>I use that word, 'Evangelist'.
    <br>I'm not an evangelist; I just named myself an evangelist.
    <br>There is nothing divine about me.
    <br>I have preached the Gospel but I do not do the will of God.
    <br>I am a sinner.
    <br>I have blasphemed so very much against the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, and The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>I have preached that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>is working for the principalities and powers,
    <br>that there is nothing godly about The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.
    <br>I am the personal assistant to my General Overseer.
    <br>We have preached and discussed that Prophet T.B. Joshua is worse than satan,
    <br>that he is worse than lucifer because there is nothing that he does
    <br>that has any bearing with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>We have preached that all the miracles and signs and wonders
    <br>that happened here are nothing but mere illusions,
    <br>that those that those things happen to, when they go back, they revert to their old state.
    <br>We have preached that The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations is a satanic place,
    <br>that it is not a place for somebody to be in.
    <br>Look at me, I call myself an evangelist.
    <br>I have blasphemed against this man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>But in all my saying that I'm an evangelist and all that,
    <br>I fornicate with girls in the church,
    <br>I preach mainly to attract attention to myself.
    <br>When I'm preaching and I see a beautiful girl that I want,
    <br>I will divert to something that I think will attract her.
    <br>I will simply use Corinthians chapter 13.
    <br>That is the chapter of love in the Bible.
    <br>It talks all about love.
    <br>While calling myself a born again and all that, I smoke Indian hemp, I lie and I cheat.
    <br>People come to me for prayers.
    <br>I lay hands on them to pray for them and when I lay hands on them,
    <br>it's merely to put my hand on their head and push them down.
    <br>I am telling you this truth here today because
    <br>I want to really expose that evil that is in me.
    <br>Calling myself an evangelist, I carried a Bible to preach heresies,
    <br>simply preaching that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua in The Synagogue,
    <br>that there's no Holy Spirit that he's working with.
    <br>I myself, what is the 'Holy Spirit' that I'm working with?
    <br>I have to let you know something here today.
    <br>This man of God - since I came here, I have learned a lot,
    <br>that without the Holy Spirit, there is nothing you can do.
    <br>When I preach and speak in tongues, I tell you, I convince everybody.
    <br>Most of the speaking in tongues you hear is just simply nothing.
    <br>Let me just show you what speaking in tongues is now and you will believe.
    <br>CONFESSIONS Of A FAKE EVANGELIST!!! | "TB Joshua Is Worse Than Satan!"
    <br>If I come to you and preach and pray for you and speak like this,
    <br>why wouldn't you believe?
    <br>This person standing here is more dangerous than those that pray
    <br>because we know that if you pray without justification,
    <br>that prayer is just mere water on the ground.
    <br>But I know that as a trained journalist and also a broadcaster,
    <br>I know the power of propaganda.
    <br>Simply drop the wrong word in the right ear at the right time and you have a forest fire.
    <br>We know that the thing to do against this man of God is simply spread the word.
    <br>Tell people that he's doing this, he's that, and you do more harm
    <br>than when you gather yourselves together and pray.
    <br>That prayer is simply a prayer without justification. It will just fall dead.
    <br>That's why I say, I'm more dangerous than even those that say that they pray.
    <br>You see the danger in sitting somewhere, hearing this or that about the particular person,
    <br>and coming to a hasty conclusion.
    <br>Satan wants you to take all you hear and read about God's servants,
    <br>without examining it in the light of God's Word.
