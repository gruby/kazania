  <p>    
    <br>This is the message for you today:
    <br>CHRISTIANITY IS A RELATIONSHIP
    <br>My proof text shall be taken from the Book of Matthew 22.
    <br>"And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said:
    <br>'The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king
    <br>who arranged a marriage for his son,
    <br>and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding;
    <br>and they were not willing to come.' "
    <br>Take note of that - "unwilling".
    <br>Verse 4:
    <br>"Again, he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited,
    <br>'See, I have prepared my dinner...' "
    <br>That is, all necessary.
    <br>I will take you to our proof text now - verse 37:
    <br>"Jesus said to him, 'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart,
    <br>with all your soul and with all your mind.'
    <br>This is the first and greatest commandment'."
    <br>That is where we are going now.
    <br>I will take you to the Book of John 21:15.
    <br>"So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,
    <br>'Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?'
    <br>He said to Him, 'Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.'
    <br>He said to him, 'Feed My lambs'."
    <br>Back to the title:
    <br>CHRISTIANITY IS A RELATIONSHIP
    <br>Relationship exists where there is love.
    <br>The kind of relationship I'm talking about has to do with love.
    <br>Christianity is a relationship; it is not a religion.
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself today:
    <br>Are we Christians, with what is happening in churches today,
    <br>where this church and that church will begin to accuse, persecute themselves,
    <br>division in the house, division within, division on the outside?
    <br>Are we Christians or religious people, going by what is happening?
    <br>We are not religious.
    <br>If we were religious, there would be division everywhere,
    <br>because of the principle that holds the religious people - it brings about division.
    <br>We are not led by senses, they are led by senses.
    <br>But today, going by what is happening all around the world -
    <br>can you tell me by what is happening and by what we are seeing all over the world...
    <br>This against this, that against that - this is not Christianity.
    <br>Jesus came to restore the fellowship and relationship between God and man.
    <br>Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.
    <br>Take note of that "fellowship".
    <br>Where there is relationship - fellowship.
    <br>Where there is fellowship - relationship.
    <br>Where there is relationship, there is love.
    <br>Nothing will keep us on course like a deep love for the Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Nothing will carry us through the hardship,
    <br>when there is no money in our pocket,
    <br>when there is sickness, hardship;
    <br>nothing will carry us through the hardship like a sincere devotion to Christ.
    <br>Ministry does not begin with a relationship with people.
    <br>It begins with a relationship with God
    <br>and that relationship overflows to people.
    <br>When you have a relationship with people,
    <br>you must know where that relationship flows from.
    <br>First, to God, then to human beings.
    <br>In that Book of John 21 - read from verse 1 to the end - I just want to read verse 15.
    <br>"So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,
    <br>'Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?'
    <br>He said to Him, 'Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.'
    <br>He said to him, 'Feed My lambs'."
    <br>It is very surprising that the Lord, Jesus did not ask Peter, 'Do you love people?'
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Loving people is important for ministry; loving God is more important.
    <br>Jesus did not ask Peter if he was a gifted speaker.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus. Amen!"
    <br>He did not ask Peter if he was a gifted speaker, a talented leader.
    <br>He did not ask Peter the seminary training or Bible college he attended.
    <br>Those things are important but they are not the issue.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Those things are important but they are not the issue."
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>[Those things are important but they are not the issue.]
    <br>The issue is quite simple.
    <br>Eloquent speaker, gifted speaker, talented leader - they are very important
    <br>but they are not the issue.
    <br>The issue is quite simple.
    <br>The basic qualification for lasting ministry
    <br>is found in Jesus' question, "Do you love Me?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In other words, "Do you have a relationship with Me?"
    <br>A relationship cannot exist without love.
    <br>Quoting the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, memorising it
    <br>and having a vast knowledge of it are very important
    <br>but they are not the issue.
    <br>The issue is quite simple.
    <br>The basic qualification for lasting ministry
    <br>is found in Jesus' question, "Do you love Me?"
    <br>In other words, "Do you have a relationship with Me?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is the question Jesus is asking you.
    <br>Church today has been taken over by man's natural gifts -
    <br>speaking skills, friendliness and ability to inspire have taken over the church.
    <br>That brings satan to begin to beat the drum in the church of God.
    <br>Man's natural gifts, ability, talent and education...
    <br>Once you can speak very well, you will begin to open the Bible and preach the Word of God.
    <br>You never knew that this is a man's natural gift.
    <br>Using man's natural gifts for God's work is dangerous.
    <br>It is challenging in the church today
    <br>and that has reduced God's Kingdom to human knowledge.
    <br>Education, ability and talent must be obedient to God's will
    <br>before one can receive God's blessing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are challenges in the church today.
    <br>The use of man's natural gifts - talent, ability and education,
    <br>these are secular knowledge and our body is the laboratory
    <br>while God's supernatural gift, our heart is the laboratory.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take your time and go to the Book of 1 Corinthians 12 and take your reading from verse 7.
    <br>"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all:
    <br>for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit,
    <br>to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit".
    <br>And so on, and so forth.
    <br>What am I trying to say here?
    <br>The supernatural gifts of the Spirit are given to believers
    <br>to minister to one another.
    <br>These are separated from man's natural gifts.
    <br>Let me give you a good example.
    <br>If I want to talk by man's natural gifts, it is my human nature that will do it.
    <br>I will teach but my human nature will take it over,
    <br>which is different from when corresponding power from Heaven comes,
    <br>which is different from when I'm under the control of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Take your Bible to John 14:26.
    <br>"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name,
    <br>He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance
    <br>all things that I said to you."
    <br>In this case now, a person has the ability to teach by man's natural gifts.
    <br>Here, the Holy Spirit teaches as He wills.
    <br>The Holy Spirit teaches, prays, fasts, witnesses and testifies as He wills.
    <br>But man has the ability to teach.
    <br>Man has the ability to fast.
    <br>Man has the ability to pray.
    <br>Man has the ability to go out and testify.
    <br>"Yes, I'm here to preach the Word of God to you.
    <br>Yes, Jesus is the Lord. I'm telling you now; you have to accept Jesus."
    <br>And he is the one testifying; Jesus never sent him.
    <br>He is doing this without corresponding power.
    <br>He is doing this without the support of Heaven.
    <br>He loves to do it.
    <br>When you love something, you must also receive the corresponding agreement, "OK, this is for you".
    <br>The challenges the church is facing is that we don't know
    <br>that the ministry of God cannot be reduced to human knowledge.
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do
    <br>but the relationship we maintain
    <br>and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You have a passion, or you love to be a pastor - you want to work for God;
    <br>this is not enough to go to school to study the Bible.
    <br>When you study the Bible, you study it, but what of the relationship we are talking about?
    <br>You have to build this relationship.
    <br>What we do for God is only a reflection of the relationship we have with God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "What we do for God is only a reflection of the relationship we have with God."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If we want to be able to do great things, we need to have a great relationship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"If you want to be able to do great things, you need to have a great relationship."
    <br>Like Daniel in the lion's den.
    <br>Daniel had a great relationship, that enabled that to happen.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>If you want to have a ministry that is strong,
    <br>your relationship must be strong with God.
    <br>Going by that text in John 21 about Peter:
    <br>Ministry does not begin with a love for people.
    <br>It begins with a love for God and that love overflows to people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This message wants to tell you to straighten your life.
    <br>Let's read together again what Jesus is saying here - it is so clear and I like that.
    <br>Listen to what He is saying.
    <br>"So when they had eaten breakfast,..."
    <br>That is you were there, I was there too - in this gathering - all Christians.
    <br>Those 12 actually make up all of us today.
    <br>You were there, I was there.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I was there, you were there".
    <br>So, in this question - insert your name there:
    <br>"When we were sitting down, eating, gathering with Jesus - we were all there..."
    <br>"So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter..."
    <br>One of us is Simon Peter.
    <br>"'Simon, son of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?'
    <br>He said to Him, 'Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.'
    <br>He said to him, 'Feed My lambs'."
    <br>Never you forget that ministry does not begin with a love for people.
    <br>It begins with a love for God and that love overflows to people.
    <br>If you say you love me, you must love God first.
    <br>If you don't love God and you say you love me,
    <br>where does the love flow from?
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not the work we do
    <br>but the relationship we maintain
    <br>and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Nothing will keep you on course like a deep love for the Lord.
    <br>When everything seems to be confused
    <br>and there seems to be trouble everywhere,
    <br>it is your love for Christ that can keep you going.
    <br>What can separate me from the love of Christ?
    <br>Can somebody answer me?
    <br>Can sickness separate me?
    <br>Affliction?
    <br>Depression?
    <br>Hardship?
    <br>What can separate me from the love of Christ?
    <br>Can you stand up now and let us shout this.
    <br>Say, "Nothing will keep you on course like a deep love for the Lord."
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When there is no money in your pocket,
    <br>it is your love for Christ that will keep you going.
    <br>What can separate you from the love of Christ?
    <br>Sickness?
    <br>Affliction?
    <br>Poverty?
    <br>What can separate you?
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Christianity is a relationship".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
