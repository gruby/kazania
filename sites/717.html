    <br>There is a brother. You have Indian hemp in your pocket.
    <br>Come out for deliverance. Jesus Christ will set you free.
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua had given this prophetic message, this man came out from the crowd
    <br>and moved toward the altar in response to the prophecy
    <br>that there is a man here with Indian hemp in his pocket.
    <br>As he steps forward to confirm the prophecy, his deliverance is only a moment away.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Instructing the man to come onto the altar,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua reaches into his pocket and pulls out an item.
    <br>What is this?
    <br>Indian hemp.
    <br>Watch your screen!
    <br>Confirming the prophecy, this is the Indian hemp that was inside the man's pocket.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Hello, sir. You are welcome.
    <br>Tell us your name, your state and where you are from.
    <br>My name is Elijah Henry Okechukwu
    <br>This is my first time of coming to this place.
    <br>I'm from Abia State, Nigeria.
    <br>We saw that the man of God was calling out words of prophecy during the first service.
    <br>You came out in response to one of them.
    <br>Can you tell us - what was the word of prophecy he spoke to you?
    <br>The man of God prophesied that there is a man here with Indian hemp.
    <br>He should please come out.
    <br>There is a brother, you have Indian hemp in your pocket.
    <br>Come out for deliverance. Jesus Christ will set you free!!
    <br>After Prophet T.B. Joshua had given this prophetic message,
    <br>this man came out from the crowd and moved toward the altar in response to the prophecy
    <br>that there is a man here with Indian hemp in his pocket.
    <br>As he steps forward to confirm the prophecy, his deliverance is only a moment away.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Instructing the man to come onto the altar,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua reaches into his pocket and pulls out an item.
    <br>What is this?
    <br>Indian hemp.
    <br>Watch your screen!
    <br>Confirming the prophecy, this is the Indian hemp that was inside the man's pocket.
    <br>Immediately he mentioned the case, I became afraid
    <br>and something fell on me, so I had to come out because I am the person.
    <br>Since I have been smoking this drug, I have been into a lot of evil, even bad gangs.
    <br>You mean that you are the one that the man of God prophesied about,
    <br>that there is a brother here who has Indian hemp in his pocket,
    <br>in the house of God, and that man should come out.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Where is that Indian hemp now?
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>This is the Indian hemp.
    <br>Okay, you mean that this in your hand is the Indian hemp that you brought to the church today
    <br>that the man of God prophesied about.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Have you told anyone that you bought Indian hemp?
    <br>How is it possible, you think, that the man of God could prophesy this?
    <br>I am surprised because this drug, I bought it yesterday; I wanted to smoke it.
    <br>Later in the night, I fell asleep; so I did not remember.
    <br>This morning, I said that after the service, I will go out and smoke it
    <br>but I was surprised that when I came here, the man of God mentioned it.
    <br>I became afraid. I have been trying to stop it but to no avail.
    <br>I thank God for being here. I know that since God has used the man of God
    <br>to prophesy about it, I know that the yoke has been broken in my life.
    <br>Amen. Continue to yield to the Holy Spirit and you will be Christ-filled,
    <br>as He continues to lead you to the throne. Thank you.
    <br>Amen.
