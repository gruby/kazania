    <br>Viewers all over the world, whatever spirits operating in your life -
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>All these complaints - contrary spirits are behind it.
    <br>Setback, shortcoming, weakness - evil spirits are responsible.
    <br>I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Spirits operating in your life, in your career, in your health,
    <br>in your finances, in your family - I command them to leave you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>I want to leave you with good health, breakthrough in your business,
    <br>breakthrough in your career, breakthrough in your marriage,
    <br>breakthrough in your finances.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Viewers, whatever you do to your neighbour, that you do to God.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>The love you give to your neighbour, that you give to God.
    <br>That which you do to your neighbour...
    <br>Your neighbour can be someone who does not share the same faith with you.
    <br>It is right to do justice to your neighbour, whether he is your fellow Christian brother or whatever.
    <br>Please - that you do to God.
    <br>Take note of that.
