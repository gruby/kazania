  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>My message today:
    <br>THE BENEFIT OF FAILURE
    <br>I know you don't want to hear that.
    <br>THE BENEFIT OF FAILURE
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Failure makes us desire God.
    <br>Many of you are here today because of...
    <br>Not because of breakthrough, that led you to know T.B. Joshua - it is this failure.
    <br>The discouragement that failure brings can be turned into a life lesson.
    <br>You listened to my documentary, when I was washing this, washing that, cleaning the fan.
    <br>Little church in the bush with little children, from 8 members,
    <br>to second church, to third church, to fourth church.
    <br>You saw my documentary.
    <br>The more that failure, the greater my desire to serve God because there is no other way.
    <br>The discouragement that comes from failure can be turned into a life experience,
    <br>a life lesson.
    <br>This is why I'm here today.
    <br>Today many of us have been toiling all day in vain.
    <br>Remember if we go through hard times,
    <br>we will be able to value and appreciate freedom when it finally comes.
    <br>If we go through hard times,
    <br>we will be able to value and appreciate that breakthrough when it finally comes.
    <br>This will take us to the Book of Daniel 6: 25-27.
    <br>But it is better if you read from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>Let me just read that proof text - verse 25.
    <br>“Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and people of every language in all the earth:
    <br>‘May you prosper greatly!
    <br>I issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom
    <br>people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel.
    <br>For he is the living God and he endures forever;
    <br>his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end.
    <br>He rescues and he saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth.
    <br>He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.’”
    <br>Take your reading from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>Don't forget the topic:
    <br>THE BENEFIT OF FAILURE
    <br>When you look at the case of Daniel in Daniel 6:25-27,
    <br>if Daniel had not been thrown into the lion’s den, he would not have been known,
    <br>he would not have had the opportunity to prove his God.
    <br>If Daniel had not been thrown into the lion’s den,
    <br>he would not have had the opportunity to prove his God.
    <br>"My God is this" - nobody knew he had a big God.
    <br>His God would not have been known by the world, by the king.
    <br>Nobody knows your God – not until you are facing challenges.
    <br>How would people know your God?
    <br>Because of your faithfulness, obedience.
    <br>Who really knows whether you are really sincere about your obedience?
    <br>You say, "I'm obedient, I'm a child of God, I'm this or that".
    <br>People know that one can be a child of God for a while.
    <br>One can be kind for a reason known to him.
    <br>One can be good for a reason known to him.
    <br>One can pretend to be good for 10 years.
    <br>People know that.
    <br>That is why it is difficult to know who is serving God today.
    <br>They say, "This man is very kind", but another time, "He is very wicked."
    <br>You know what has happened to you in life.
    <br>Many of your friends that you praised in the past, "This man is very nice. Oh my God, what a nice man",
    <br>but suddenly you say, "Ah, how is this man now? Don't talk about him again.
    <br>Which man? No."
    <br>About the same man you used to say that he was a nice and good man.
    <br>People now ask you, "How is your friend?"
    <br>"Who is my friend?
    <br>No. I don't want to talk about him."
    <br>One can be very nice, for a while, even for ten or twenty years - for many years.

    <br>He had the opportunity to prove his God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "The benefit of failure".
    <br>His God would have not been known.
    <br>Let's hear what the king says about God of Daniel.
    <br>“ ‘For he is the living God and he endures forever;
    <br>his kingdom will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end.
    <br>He rescues and he saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth.
    <br>He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.’ “
    <br>His God would not have been known if not for the challenges,
    <br>if not for that failure, that persecution, that trouble he faced.
    <br>He had the opportunity to prove his God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>See another thing failure also did in Luke 5:1-11 about Peter.
    <br>If Peter had had the desired catch of fish, he may not have encountered Jesus.
    <br>If Peter had had the desired catch of fish, at the seaside,
    <br>Peter would not have encountered Jesus.
    <br>See what disappointment, failure did.
    <br>It moved Peter to a higher level.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask any successful businessman and he will tell you how much disappointment and setback
    <br>he had to endure to come to a new level in life.
    <br>Ask any successful businessman and he will tell you how much disappointment,
    <br>how much failure, how much setback, how much name-calling
    <br>he had to endure to come to a new level in life.
    <br>Just ask any successful couple today and they will tell you how much disagreement,
    <br>how much challenging situations they had to put up with
    <br>to come to a new level in their marriage.
    <br>Let someone say, "The benefit of failure".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>The benefit of failure.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Gold is not valued until it is tested.
    <br>You too are not valued until you are tested by failure, disappointment, stagnation,
    <br>sickness, disease.
    <br>I am not valued until I am tested.
    <br>Gold is not valued until it is tested.
    <br>And gold is not an ornament until it is tested by fire.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>See what is breaking marriages today; little things, this, that - marry and remarry everywhere.
    <br>Sack letter.
    <br>Relationship - sack letter.
    <br>Anything can break the relationship.
    <br>God sometimes uses foolish things to confuse us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>God sometimes uses foolish things to confuse us.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>God sometimes uses foolish things to confuse us.
    <br>You get confused, "What has happened?
    <br>I didn't know that this man was a smoker, before I married him.
    <br>What will I do now?"
    <br>"I did not know that this woman was a fighter; very disgraceful.
    <br>All this - I never knew. Will I leave the marriage now?"
    <br>God sometimes uses foolish things to confuse us.
    <br>Poverty can humiliate one.
    <br>Contempt can humiliate one.
    <br>Sickness, disease – just name them – can humiliate one.
    <br>At the time you have a sickness you say, "I'm not a Christian. That is why I have this disease."
    <br>You start living your reckless life again.
    <br>"I'm not a Christian, that is why I fail. If I were a Christian, I would not fail. Look at others.
    <br>God does not hear me, that is why all this has happened to me. I'm not a Christian."
    <br>You start living a reckless life.
    <br>"The reckless life caused sickness - let me continue.
    <br>If I have been living right, and I have a sickness - let me continue my reckless life."
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a Christian.
    <br>A man can be sick in body and yet be a Christian, a friend of God.
    <br>A man can be sick.
    <br>Sickness is a sickness; whether it is HIV, cancer, whatever you call it -
    <br>a man can be sick and yet be a Christian.
    <br>But today, when one is sick, you say, "Reckless life caused all this.
    <br>Sin caused sickness. I have not been living a reckless life; why is all this happening to me?
    <br>Let me continue my reckless life."
    <br>That is why you see people today; when they are sick, they keep it to themselves,
    <br>they don't want people to know that they are sick
    <br>because they know that if people knew about their sickness, they would say,
    <br>"He has been living a reckless life, that's why he is sick".
    <br>Because of that, only the doctor has their medical report.
    <br>They can open up to doctors; any other person - no.
    <br>People die just like that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When something happens, whether good or bad, whether positive or negative,
    <br>it would be too soon to despair, it would be too soon to complain,
    <br>it would be too soon to murmur or jubilate
    <br>without finding out what God says about it
    <br>because there is an unseen hand in everything that happens under the sun.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is an unseen hand in everything that happens under the sun.
    <br>Whether you have a breakthrough, it would be too soon, too early to start, "O happy day!",
    <br>to start changing your wardrobe, moving to rich people areas, changing your attire, style of movement...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And this is a man who used to walk like that...
    <br>but now...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Anybody would notice, "My brother did not walk like this before. What happened? I need to find out."
    <br>"How are you?"
    <br>You changed everything completely; your dominion, your appearance,
    <br>Everything about you changed - even your stomach changed.
    <br>Before, you could eat anything, but now you have to eat...
    <br>You have to test your food.
    <br>Your colour changed; you are known as a black guy, now, immediately light in complexion.
    <br>There is an unseen hand in everything that happens under the sun.
    <br>As I'm walking now, if I'm here for God, something is behind my walk, is giving me a tap,
    <br>so that I can do the walk of the person giving me a tap - that is the Spirit of God.
    <br>You cannot live a neutral life. It is not possible. Something must push you.
    <br>Either the Spirit of God, or - I don't want to mention that foolish spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is an unseen hand.
    <br>You have to decide to keep getting up every time you fail.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You have to decide to keep getting up every time you fail.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>You have to decide to keep getting up every time you fail.
    <br>Because whether wrong or right…
    <br>Since God sometimes uses foolish things to confuse us;
    <br>this failure - maybe to keep me for a new level.
    <br>This failure may be to protect me, to strengthen my desire.
    <br>If not that failure, how many of you would be here today?
    <br>You are here today because of that.
    <br>You have to decide to keep getting up every time you fail.
    <br>Don’t waste your time lamenting on past failures.
    <br>"I don't know why this thing has happened to me."
    <br>Don’t waste your time lamenting on past failures at all
    <br>because no one can live a perfect life – without mistakes.
    <br>"No. I have been sacked just like that. Upon all I have been doing for the company -
    <br>can you see the way I was sacked.
    <br>See the way the man, woman pushed me out of the house.
    <br>I don't know."
    <br>Don’t waste your time lamenting, complaining of past failures.
    <br>You have to stop repeating stories of those who failed you if you want to get there.
    <br>All men fall; the great ones get back up.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>All men fall but the great ones get back up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don’t allow fear of failure to rob you of productivity and the joy of life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you are going for another business, you remember the failure of yesterday.
    <br>The last time you were promised to come and meet the general manager for a contract.
    <br>The way you were being treated last time - now, you remember that one,
    <br>"Oh I don't know if I get there now, it is an embarrassment". No.
    <br>Don’t allow fear of failure to rob you of productivity and the joy of life.
    <br>Be ready to accept failure and learn from your experience.
    <br>What is the experience?
    <br>THE BENEFIT OF FAILURE
    <br>Failure is not falling short of your goal.
    <br>Failure is simply not making the effort.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>By the way, failure is good for us.
    <br>Through failure, we learn the consequences of our actions.
    <br>It is good!
    <br>"Why has this happened to me? Oh yes - I went to a witch doctor.
    <br>Maybe that charm I used to carry - magic.
    <br>It was not like this. I need to give my life to God.
    <br>My lifetime
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>If I give God my lifetime
    <br>He will take care of me
    <br>He will never ever let me down
    <br>I will give God my lifetime
    <br>Yes!
    <br>By the way, failure is good for us
    <br>because through failure, we learn the consequences of our own actions.
    <br>You are a drunkard; you have been smoking.
    <br>Suddenly you fall sick and you are taken to the doctor.
    <br>By the time they test you - the doctor never knew you were a smoker and drunkard -
    <br>the doctor says, "These are traces of cancer."
    <br>"Say it again."
    <br>The doctor says, "OK, I'm coming".
    <br>He locks the door.
    <br>He moves to his colleague - there are some doctors that have a heart - he can declare death...
    <br>But the one who informed you about traces of cancer - never...
    <br>"Uncle, you know you have a heart to say anything. There is a patient waiting there."
    <br>"What happened?"
    <br>"I was telling him I see traces of cancer. He said, "Ehe?" That "ehe" - my heart, I can't carry it."
    <br>"Where is he? OK, let's go."
    <br>"Excuse me. How are you?" - you say, "Fine."
    <br>"What we are seeing in your blood is frightening."
    <br>"What is frightening?"
    <br>"Are you a smoker? A drunkard? These are the traces we are seeing."
    <br>"OK, what is the way out?"
    <br>"Stop smoking, stop drinking."
    <br>"Okay. That's all?"
    <br>For you to live a perfect life, accept and learn from it -
    <br>accept that mistake and learn from that mistake.
    <br>THE BENEFIT OF FAILURE - let someone say it.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>THE BENEFIT OF FAILURE
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>THE BENEFIT OF FAILURE
    <br>You can imagine how many places you have worked in, in the past.
    <br>Failure has become your enemy.
    <br>Anywhere you fail, you will never go back there.
    <br>You fail here - you will never go back there, "No that is not my way."
    <br>Who told you it was not your way?
    <br>You can imagine how many business cards you have;
    <br>you are the architect, lawyer, civil engineer, contractor.
    <br>It is failure that led you to all this.
    <br>It is simple - failure that led you.
    <br>You have seen failure as an enemy.
    <br>You see failure as an enemy; that is why you do this.
    <br>When you fail, you abandon them; failure comes, you abandon them...
    <br>You keep moving from pillar to post - circle of life.
    <br>When you have sickness, you begin to trace the root of sickness.
    <br>You are a human being - this body must be sick.
    <br>If you are a Christian, your sickness is not like others’.
    <br>If you have cancer as a Christian, your cancer is not like others’.
    <br>Others’ cancer kills, destroys but your cancer is to improve you, your relationship with God.
    <br>Failure makes us desire God.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I want to leave you here; think about all this.
    <br>Go home and think about that.
    <br>Let us rise up now and lift up our voice.
    <br>Ask God to remove the resistance to His will.
    <br>God – remove the resistance to Your will.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Remove the resistance.
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name we pray.
    <br>I hope you have seen the position of failure in your life.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>It is a strength; you derive strength.
    <br>You are not valued until you are tested.
    <br>I'm in your midst today; you know where I'm coming from - my journey so far -
    <br>my track record when it comes to failure.
    <br>You should be ready.
    <br>Don’t allow fear of failure to rob you of productivity and the joy of life.
    <br>You want to be happy, but when you remember, "I failed in this, that... What will I do now?" - No!
    <br>Be ready to accept failure and learn from your experience.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
