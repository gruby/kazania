    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>I won't talk.
    <br>She's my wife.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>She will never marry because she is mine.
    <br>What have you done to her family?
    <br>Stagnation, limitation - she will never use her certificate.
    <br>What have you done to her career?
    <br>She will be working and resigning.
    <br>She just resigned from Samsung.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Children of God, shout Emmanuel for me!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I'm here to thank God for my deliverance
    <br>by the touch of the man of God because it was a Heavenly touch.
    <br>My name is Iwuchukwu Vivian.
    <br>It all started when my father died.
    <br>Everything went wrong 
    <br>because my father was the breadwinner then.
    <br>He helped his brothers. When he died, all of them refused to help us.
    <br>One of them told us - the one in Germany, a medical doctor -
    <br>that we should leave where we were staying and go to the village.
    <br>I was kind of stubborn because of that spiritual husband.
    <br>So I refused.
    <br>I said, "I'm in school already and my younger ones are not going to stop schooling.
    <br>I will find the means for us to continue our studies".
    <br>One of my friends told me that there was a party at the government house at Owerri.
    <br>I studied logistics management technology at the University of Technology in Owerri.
    <br>So we went to the party - it was a gala night.
    <br>He told me that at that party, they would give 'thanks for coming'.
    <br>What I mean by 'thanks for coming' is: if you meet a man or not, they would give you money.
    <br>It was a caucus of senators and commissioners.
    <br>At that party I met a commissioner.
    <br>He became my friend.
    <br>That's how staying with married men started.
    <br>The man was kind of assisting me, helping me.
    <br>That's how I was able to assist my younger ones.
    <br>It continued. There was this thing I noticed about myself:
    <br>Anywhere I went to - before I was delivered -
    <br>there was this spirit that got men to be attracted to me.
    <br>When they came and we exchanged contacts,
    <br>I would be in the house and they would call me. I would go and meet them.
    <br>After sleeping with them, they would give me money.
    <br>So I would go home with it and continue my life.
    <br>The money I gathered, I used It to start little business whilst being in school like selling clothes.
    <br>I kept doing that until I finished university.
    <br>When I moved to Port Harcourt, I met new friends.
    <br>After my studies, I started work.
    <br>Like the stupid spiritual husband said:
    <br>I never used my certificate. As I worked, I resigned.
    <br>It's true because I worked for four good companies with a good job
    <br>but I ended up resigning for no reason.
    <br>I resigned on my own. Even the last one, I resigned from the company I was working for.
    <br>I left my work. I don't know about other companies but in this company,
    <br>you have to give one month notice before you can leave the company.
    <br>But I couldn't do that. I had to just forfeit my salary and resigned.
    <br>I resigned; nobody sacked me.
    <br>I know that some from my office are watching me and they know what I'm saying.
    <br>So after resigning, did you actually come back to your senses
    <br>or what normally happened after you voluntarily resigned from your job?
    <br>Still the 'men business'.
    <br>Whenever I went to the market, it was like that time it became more serious than before.
    <br>Whenever I wanted to go to the market or church,
    <br>or maybe board a cab to where I was going to,
    <br>I would just see a car by my side.
    <br>It would be a very expensive car - a machine, not just a car.
    <br>So when they stopped, I would exchange contacts.
    <br>Maybe they were not going in the direction I was going to or I was not in the mood at that moment.
    <br>I would take a complimentary card or contacts.
    <br>They would give me a call. They would be the ones to call.
    <br>They would keep disturbing me because of that spiritual husband.
    <br>It's not like I knew what I was doing.
    <br>I knew myself but what was wrong, what attracted all those things is what I didn't know.
    <br>If they were shopping for me, I would tell them, "Let me see the picture of your wife.
    <br>Why don't you shop for your wife too".
    <br>So they would say,  "Ok, this is the picture".
    <br>I would pick clothes - good clothes - or shoes.
    <br>Then the man would go home with it and give it to his wife.
    <br>The wife would think it was the husband that bought it.
    <br>No, it was the girlfriend outside who initiated that.
    <br>So that would make them to be more interested and come even closer to me.
    <br>So at that point when I got money, I didn't know what I used it for.
    <br>It was just for shopping.
    <br>Whenever I payed my bills or spent it on family issues, I was left with nothing.
    <br>So I decided, "Ok, let me just save up money and start a business.
    <br>At least I know how to style hair".
    <br>A particular man - he had spoken twice to me before -
    <br>the day that I called him that I needed money for something,
    <br>he told me that it was like I had a spiritual husband.
    <br>I said, "I have been hearing about this kind of thing".
    <br>I knew something was wrong with me but I didn't know what it was.
    <br>I agreed to go.
    <br>He set a date and we went to a place - somewhere in Enugu State.
    <br>When we entered, we reached a point where nothing like a motorcycle or car was passing.
    <br>It was a bush.
    <br>We started entering, and I asked, "What is this? Exactly where are we going to?"
    <br>At the top of this hill was an ocean or river.
    <br>People were there - plenty of people.
    <br>When you got there, they would call your name and start telling you why you came and all that.
    <br>So I was there.
    <br>They told me what I was going to pay so that they would remove the spiritual husband,
    <br>and also open my way so that things would not be difficult for me anymore.
    <br>They said I should pay N320,000.
    <br>I ended up spending that money there.
    <br>And that money - it was not that I spent it or they were using it -
    <br>they would tear the money into four pieces, throw it into the ocean and say some things.
    <br>Before then, they said that there were some things they needed to get
    <br>for me to bath in that ocean on top of that hill.
    <br>During the bath, I would do some sacrifice.
    <br>They mentioned chicken and all that. Fanta, precisely.
    <br>So when they mentioned all those things,
    <br>I said, "I can't bring all those things, I don't know where to bring it from".
    <br>They said, "Okay, pay the money. We will bring it for you".
    <br>I paid.
    <br>The money I was saving up - I ended up spending all.
    <br>So they bathed me and in the process of bathing me, they cut my hair.
    <br>They cut my nails - my toenails and my fingernails.
    <br>After performing all these sacrifices, what happened?
    <br>Were you able to make any headway towards all the problems you were encountering in your life?
    <br>My sister, nothing.
    <br>So how did you end up knowing about The SCOAN?
    <br>That you now came here and you received your deliverance?
    <br>When I was at home and I woke up from sleep -
    <br>I am the type that likes watching movies.
    <br>So I started watching a movie.
    <br>After the movie finished, there was nothing else to watch.
    <br>I was flipping through TV channels.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua's channel came up.
    <br>He was saying, "Viewers all over the world" - he was praying on TV.
    <br>You mean Emmanuel TV?
    <br>Yes, Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So I prayed along with him. After praying along with him, I slept.
    <br>Something like a light came, flashed on my eyes and slapped me.
    <br>When the thing slapped me, it was like something came out of my eyes.
    <br>So I jumped up.
    <br>It was around 4 am. It was already getting to daybreak.
    <br>So as I woke up, I said, "What is this? What kind of dream is this?"
    <br>I just said a short prayer and lay down again.
    <br>In the morning, I started getting my brain back.
    <br>I started realising that it was true. That I had spent all my money on nonsense.
    <br>That what was I going to do now?
    <br>What was going on? Where was I going to start from now?
    <br>Was I to start with men again and all that?
    <br>Because that was the only point, that was what I could fall back on again.
    <br>I said to myself that I still had little money in my account.
    <br>That this was maybe because I had prayed with the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Let me just go there.
    <br>I went to a hotel and booked my ticket to Lagos last week.
    <br>So when I came, that's when the man of God touched me.
    <br>At that point I didn't even know where I was, I didn't know what happened next.
    <br>I just saw someone coming.
    <br>But before then, when he was coming, I was shivering. I noticed that I wasn't myself anymore.
    <br>As I was standing, the next thing I saw was a hammer on my head.
    <br>I looked. I had a complete blackout. I didn't know what happened till now.
    <br>I thank God so much.
    <br>So what are the changes that you have seen since your deliverance?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You know this deliverance is of a thing... People are used to hear of deliverance.
    <br>When you are delivered, you yourself will know that you are delivered.
    <br>You feel this joy.
    <br>On that day when I was delivered, some people - I don't know whether they are here,
    <br>they may be watching me, the people that were in the church last week.
    <br>I was so excited.
    <br>My body was sweating as if I had won something somewhere.
    <br>I'm now okay. I'm free. I sleep well. I wake up well. I don't have those thoughts anymore.
    <br>They don't even call. I've deleted all their numbers.
    <br>I'm intending to change my telephone number.
    <br>And what about the spiritual husband that used to torment you in your dreams?
    <br>That one - he has gone back to where he came from.
    <br>To the pit of hell!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful deliverance that you have received.
    <br>What do you want to advise people that are listening to your wonderful testimony?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My advice goes to young men and young ladies:
    <br>To be frank, all these we are seeing while being on campus...
    <br>First of all, choose your friends. Don't let your friends choose you.
    <br>Secondly, if you're a young girl, and you noticed...
    <br>I'm not giving this testimony to entice you.
    <br>I'm giving it and praying to God that this testimony will change a soul
    <br>because then I was in the world; now I'm a new creation.
    <br>I'm not ashamed of my testimony.
    <br>I'm so proud of myself because I have finally made it.
    <br>And I know that I am okay. I also pray that any young lady that is listening to me here,
    <br>please go to a living church.
    <br>If you are not sure of any, run to The SCOAN -
    <br>just the same way I used my last money and paid for my flight ticket to this place.
    <br>Come here and you will get your deliverance.
    <br>And also your salvation will increase.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Vivian Iwuchukwu. I am from Port Harcourt.
    <br>What brought me to the church was my deliverance, which I have gotten.
    <br>I thank God. I'm delivered now, and I'm okay.
    <br>I was in the congregation when the man of God was touching people at the side where I was.
    <br>He touched me, and the spiritual husband inside of me manifested.
    <br>He was saying that I will not use my certificate,
    <br>I will not get married and that I will be working and resigning,
    <br>which I confirmed to be true.
    <br>I also thank God that after the deliverance, I'm now okay,
    <br>my dreams are fine, everything is okay.
    <br>The evil spirit pushed me to be with married men.
    <br>I stayed with them, they gave me money.
    <br>At the end of the day, I couldn't give account of the money.
    <br>When I was working, I resigned from four companies.
    <br>When I resigned from the last company, I had to run to God for help
    <br>because I didn't know what was happening to me anymore.
    <br>I was eating in my dreams. At times, I would be at a riverside or ocean.
    <br>At times, I would have an affair in my dreams.
    <br>Since your deliverance at The SCOAN, after Prophet T.B. Joshua had prayed for you,
    <br>tell us how your life has changed.
    <br>Now I am a new person. I feel so happy inside my heart, inside of me.
    <br>I sleep very well. My dreams are fine.
    <br>I sleep singing in my dreams, and I wake up singing.
    <br>Reading the Bible is now part of me.
    <br>I always meditate with my faith bracelet.
    <br>It is always with me which is helping me to build my faith more,
    <br>to maintain my deliverance and my salvation.
    <br>By the grace of God, I want to be self-employed and independent,
    <br>make money myself and help my family instead of going the other way round.
    <br>To God be the glory. We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners are very much concerned about you
    <br>and the next step that you want to take in Christ Jesus,
    <br>to make sure that you continue to make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>They are supporting you with this sum of 200,000 naira.
    <br>Vivian Receives N200,000 From T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners To Start A New Life In Christ
    <br>I want to thank God for this and also thank the man of God so much
    <br>because this is a new beginning and I know this money is coming from the altar
    <br>and it will go a long way. It will bear fruits - more than the money out there.
    <br>I'm so happy to start my life with this.
    <br>I want to tell the man of God: May the Almighty God keep him for us
    <br>because he is the prophet of our generation.
    <br>His family - favour befall them. He will grow from strength to strength,
    <br>anointing to anointing, grace to grace.
    <br>Heaven will always be with him.
    <br>I thank God for his life, and I promise him I'll make it up to him.
    <br>I'll make him proud with this, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. To God be the glory.
    <br>We pray that God Almighty gives you that grace to stay far from sin
    <br>and close to Him as you continue to make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>So lastly, give a word of advice to people watching you all over the world.
    <br>My advice to people like I said on Sunday:
    <br>To ladies - if you notice that something is wrong with you
    <br>and maybe you are going off track, please run to God.
    <br>He is the only solution. He is the only way for you to have peace of mind.
    <br>Please emulate the Word of God. That's the only way out.
    <br>With your Bible, call on the Holy Spirit. He will see you through.
    <br>Amen. We want to encourage you too that it is not all about the situation you are facing,
    <br>nor where you are but who you are in Christ Jesus that really matters.
    <br>Everyone faces common challenges and calamities of life
    <br>but what makes you a Christian, what makes you a child of God
    <br>is not what you go through, but how you go through them.
    <br>So continue to choose God's way and not the way of the world
    <br>and the best is yet to come for you and your family, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am free. Thank You, Holy Spirit, for this opportunity.
    <br>Thank you because I'll make good use of it, in Jesus' name. Amen
