    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Richard Martins. I am a Nigerian residing in Cape Town, South Africa.
    <br>I want to testify how God saved my life and the lives of other passengers in an aircraft.
    <br>On the 19th of this month, when I was coming from Johannesburg to Lagos,
    <br>after twenty minutes in the air, the pilot announced that there was a fire in the engine.
    <br>He said that we had to go back for an emergency landing.
    <br>My brothers and sisters, when this type of thing was announced in the aircraft,
    <br>all the people started shivering and some people were crying.
    <br>The pilot told us not to worry and that in the next 15 minutes we would be landing.
    <br>My brothers and sisters, the 15 minutes the pilot promised us turned into 40 to 45 minutes.
    <br>He tried to land the first time, but he couldn't land. He went up again.
    <br>There was turbulence - it was so rocky that it made people start crying.
    <br>People were shouting, asking how they were going to survive this.
    <br>It happened three times that he tried to land.
    <br>I then remembered that I had the Anointing Water in my pocket and I took it out.
    <br>SUPERNATURAL EMERGENCY LANDING!
    <br>Now brother, just before you go ahead, we just want to understand.
    <br>The pilot announced that there was a fire in the engine of the aircraft
    <br>and you had to return for an emergency landing. Is that correct?
    <br>That's correct.
    <br>And you said that the pilot said in 15 minutes you were supposed to land.
    <br>But after 45 minutes, after several attempts to land, you were still in the air.
    <br>Can you just describe the atmosphere on the plane at that moment with what was going on?
    <br>Yes, it was a terrible situation.
    <br>You know, when you are in the air, you can't see anything.
    <br>There is no way you can have a clue as to what will happen in the next minute.
    <br>That was when people started crying.
    <br>And the turbulence that happened when the plane tried to land the first time made people panic even more.
    <br>There were many people and some children were also crying.
    <br>That was when I took out the Anointing Water - when he tried to land for the third time, but he couldn't do it.
    <br>When I remembered that I had the Anointing Water, I brought it out of my pocket.
    <br>I then ministered it from my seat where I was sitting.
    <br>The people who were sitting next to me were amazed.
    <br>They said, "Brother, you have this in the aircraft. That means our lives are safe".
    <br>SUPERNATURAL EMERGENCY LANDING!
    <br>That gave most of the people seated with me joy - they joined me in prayer.
    <br>I prayed, "God of T.B. Joshua, deliver us".
    <br>God's intervention was what we were praying for.
    <br>We wanted a successful landing.
    <br>Immediately after I ministered the Anointing Water with prayer - it was not even two minutes -
    <br>the plane landed safely without a problem.
    <br>SUPERNATURAL EMERGENCY LANDING!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>SUPERNATURAL EMERGENCY LANDING!
    <br>Now brother, you said before you ministered this Anointing Water
    <br>there was commotion, there was panic, there was trouble in the plane.
    <br>Tell us, how did the atmosphere change once you ministered the Anointing Water?
    <br>The moment I finished ministering the Anointing Water, there was peace.
    <br>There was no more turbulence.
    <br>That was when the plane landed successfully, two minutes after ministering the Anointing Water.
    <br>Wow! This is a wonderful miracle. Let's put our hands together one more time for Jesus Christ.
    <br>And we can just imagine what may have happened if not for God's intervention in such a situation
    <br>where a pilot had already told the passengers that there was a fire within the engine of the plane
    <br>and they had to have an emergency landing.
    <br>45 minutes later they were still in the air.
    <br>Truly this is a wonderful miracle,
    <br>how God Almighty rescued and protected every member and passenger within this aircraft
    <br>through the New Anointing Water.
    <br>And tell us brother, the moment the plane landed, what happened? What was the scenario that unfolded there?
    <br>Even before the plane landed, the fire fighters were all over the place.
    <br>They were ready to help if there were any problems.
    <br>Thankfully and the way God wanted, we landed safely.
    <br>There was no fire and the atmosphere was very calm and peaceful.
    <br>Glory be to God. We thank Jesus Christ for protecting our brother and every other passenger in that aircraft
    <br>through God's protection in the New Anointing Water.
    <br>Finally sir, what do you want to advise people around the world
    <br>about this precious gift that you are holding right now?
    <br>I want to advise the people all over the world:
    <br>No matter wherever you find yourself, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>The Anointing Water that you are holding or you are privileged to get is not ordinary water.
    <br>Wherever you are and whatever situation you find yourself in, believe that there is power in this Anointing Water.
    <br>Praise God.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
