    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Give the neighbour behind you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>God is with us!
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of God.
    <br>Welcome once again, in Jesus' name.
    <br>My name is Brother Chris and it is a wonderful privilege to share the Word
    <br>of the Most High God with you today.
    <br>And today I want to talk about a very sensitive subject,
    <br>which is often misunderstood but is very important for your spiritual life.
    <br>Remember, the first place you must prosper is in your spiritual life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>the first place you must prosper is your spiritual life."
    <br>We are just a matter of weeks before the new year,
    <br>in fact the new decade - 2020.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for the grace to have seen us thus far.
    <br>The best way for you to prepare for the New Year, for the new decade, for 2020,
    <br>is to take care of your spiritual life, to take care of your relationship with God.
    <br>So, today's message is for believers.
    <br>I mean, those who sincerely desire to build their relationship with God
    <br>because of who He is, not merely what He gives.
    <br>If you take a look at the world we are in today,
    <br>you will agree with me that we are living in an imperfect world.
    <br>Would you agree with that?
    <br>We are living in an imperfect world. In fact, there is no such thing as a perfect person.
    <br>The Scripture makes this very clear.
    <br>Romans 3:10 and 23 say that for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
    <br>There is no one righteous, not even one.
    <br>Perfection eludes everyone.
    <br>That includes me, that includes you, that includes our viewers all over the world.
    <br>Everyone makes mistakes, including children of God.
    <br>Take note of this, brethren:
    <br>It is not that children of God do not make mistakes or do the wrong thing
    <br>but when they do, their heart is troubled because it is not their will to commit sin.
    <br>That's why I said today's message is for believers
    <br>because for others out there,
    <br>many people today don't care if they commit sin.
    <br>There are some people who are even happy
    <br>when their actions bring others pain or sadness.
    <br>For children of God, for people of God, when we take a wrong step, when we do the wrong thing,
    <br>our heart is troubled and our conscience would not allow us to have peace
    <br>until we ask for and obtain forgiveness.
    <br>This is what the psalmist vividly described in that Book of Psalm 38:4.
    <br>He said, "My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear."
    <br>He equally said in Psalm 40:12:
    <br>"For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me..."
    <br>In Psalm 51:3 he said:
    <br>"For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me."
    <br>That is a child of God.
    <br>Yes, we may make mistakes but our heart is troubled.
    <br>This is how to know a true child of God:
    <br>When a child of God commits sin or attempts to do so,
    <br>the Holy Spirit would prompt his conscience to accuse him to repentance.
    <br>When I say conscience, I mean our heart.
    <br>As Romans 9:1 says, it is the communication point, contact for the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Our conscience is the very instrument the Holy Spirit uses to guide our souls.
    <br>Everyone here has a conscience.
    <br>You know that?
    <br>There are many occasions when we are in our privates, we are alone in a secret place
    <br>and we know we have done something wrong either by thoughts, word or deed.
    <br>No one saw us, no one caught us, no one apart from you and God is aware,
    <br>but at that moment your heart becomes troubled, "Why did I do that?
    <br>Why did I react like that? Why did I behave like that?"
    <br>That is your conscience!
    <br>Our conscience is the very instrument used by the Holy Spirit to guide our soul.
    <br>But brethren, take note of this vital truth:
    <br>The Holy Spirit will prompt you, not force you.
    <br>When you make a mistake as a child of God, you are faced with a vital choice:
    <br>Do you listen to your conscience, your heart or ignore it?
    <br>Do you open up or do you cover up?
    <br>Do you confess or do you conceal?
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and ask your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>when you make a mistake, how do you respond?"
    <br>Do you listen to your conscience or ignore it?"
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, remember this:
    <br>Your response determines your future."
    <br>This leads us to the title of today's message:
    <br>LET YOUR CONSCIENCE BE YOUR GUIDE
    <br>Tell your neighbour, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>let your conscience be your guide."
    <br>Brethren, I want to talk to you today about the importance of listening to your conscience
    <br>and the danger of covering up your wrongdoing.
    <br>Do you know what I mean when I say "cover-up", "to cover up your wrongdoing"?
    <br>When you refuse to admit or acknowledge your wrong,
    <br>"I didn't do it", whereas you are the one that did it.
    <br>"I don't know anything about it", whereas you know everything about it.
    <br>Cover-up - it is dangerous.
    <br>It always seems more convenient to cover up your wrongdoing,
    <br>until you come to realise that you may get away with it in the natural
    <br>but you don't get away with it in the Spirit.
    <br>You may get away with it in the flesh but you don't get away with it in the Spirit.
    <br>Covering up may bring short-term benefits to the flesh but it inflicts long-term damage to the heart.
    <br>Turn with me to the Book of Proverbs 28:13,
    <br>which is the proof text for today's message - let your conscience be your guide.
    <br>Verse 13 says this:
    <br>"Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper,
    <br>but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy."
    <br>I repeat it once again.
    <br>"Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper."
    <br>The wise man here is not simply referring to financial or material prosperity;
    <br>he is referring to spiritual prosperity - peace of conscience, ease of heart, eternal joy,
    <br>freedom from fear, the security of God's presence, assurance of life everlasting with Jesus.
    <br>These are the dividends of spiritual prosperity.
    <br>To put it simply, what the wise man is telling us here is this:
    <br>When you cover up your wrong, you cannot make spiritual progress.
    <br>You may make money, you may find fame, you can attain position and find possessions
    <br>whilst covering up your wrong, your sin
    <br>but you cannot make spiritual progress when you cover up your wrong.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because in the process of covering up your wrong, you end up committing more wrong.
    <br>In the process of covering up your sin, you end up committing even worse sins.
    <br>I want to give you an example to demonstrate the danger of covering up your wrong.
    <br>Thank you very much, brother.
    <br>You can drop the chairs here.
    <br>I want to just paint a very simple scenario for you; perhaps you can relate.
    <br>You have had a long day at work,
    <br>you are a little bit stressed, it has been a bit of a tough day,
    <br>and at your work place you are coming to your office, where the staff have their belongings
    <br>and you take a seat and you are hungry.
    <br>It has been a long day.
    <br>And there is no one else there in the office.
    <br>And you look at the cupboard that is in the office.
    <br>You take a quick peek to your left, to your right - there is no one there.
    <br>Let me take a look inside.
    <br>A sandwich!
    <br>This is what I call "a sandwich situation".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "A sandwich situation."
    <br>You may say it is just a small thing, but remember, everything big starts little.
    <br>I'm hungry but I know this sandwich does not belong to me.
    <br>I'm not the owner of this sandwich.
    <br>Another member of staff is the one who kept that sandwich,
    <br>but at that moment temptation strikes,
    <br>"Perhaps the person that left it here forgot about it.
    <br>I'm sure he won't even enjoy the sandwich. Let me just quickly take it."
    <br>You quickly open it up.
    <br>Then, you make sure the door is shut, there is no one coming from the corridor.
    <br>What do you do?
    <br>You eat it fast!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Quickly!
    <br>No one will see what you have done.
    <br>Then, you hide it back inside and pretend that nothing happened.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What a beautiful sandwich.
    <br>You have to quickly cover up; you can see there are some stains there,
    <br>"I don't want anyone to see I was the one. Let me cover this up."
    <br>As a Christian, even at this point, your conscience will begin to disturb you,
    <br>"I just ate someone's sandwich. I hope the person will not be annoyed. I don't know what will happen."
    <br>Let me tell you at this point - do you know what you have done?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I'm just going to use these chairs to illustrate my wrong.
    <br>I have just taken what does not belong to me - this is wrong.
    <br>There is no "two ways" to describe it.
    <br>Even though I was hungry, even though it looked very inviting,
    <br>even though the person may have left it there for long,
    <br>it was wrong for me to take that sandwich.
    <br>Suddenly, a knock at the door.
    <br>Someone comes in; another staff member.
    <br>He goes to the cupboard, opens it up, "Someone ate my sandwich.
    <br>Who ate my sandwich?"
    <br>He looks at you.
    <br>At this point you have a choice.
    <br>Do you admit, "I'm sorry. I was the one" and quickly settle the matter,
    <br>or do you deny and start the journey of cover-up?
    <br>For many of us here today, let's be sincere;
    <br>many of us would say, "Sandwich? What sandwich? I did not know there was a sandwich there."
    <br>"But someone just ate the sandwich. I came 10 minutes ago - there was another sandwich.
    <br>Who ate it?"
    <br>"Me, I don't even like sandwiches. I have never eaten them in my life.
    <br>They are disgusting."
    <br>What have you just done!?
    <br>To cover up your wrong, you have added another wrong.
    <br>You have lied.
    <br>Let's increase this mountain.
    <br>From taking what is not yours to lying, in the process of covering up your wrong.
    <br>The person looks at you and says, "But who do you think did take this sandwich then?"
    <br>"Maybe it was Steven? I know that he didn't use to like you."
    <br>What have you done!? 
    <br>You have added another one.
    <br>You have just gone and falsely accused Steven.
    <br>In the process of cover-up - another mountain,
    <br>just because of a sandwich.
    <br>The guy looks at you and says, "You mean Steven did this?"
    <br>"I'm very sure he did. Do you know last week I heard him laughing about you behind your back."
    <br>What have you just done!?
    <br>Gossip.
    <br>Let's add another one.
    <br>There you go.
    <br>For the sake of the sandwich, you have gone from taking what is not yours to lying.
    <br>You have gone from lying to false accusation.
    <br>You have gone from false accusation to gossip just in an attempt to cover up your wrong.
    <br>"Steven - I knew that he had something against me.
    <br>What do you think we should do?"
    <br>"Well, if I were you, I would go and report him straight to the manager.
    <br>This behaviour is completely out of bounds."
    <br>"You are right. This is what I'm going to do."
    <br>What have you just done!?
    <br>Revenge.
    <br>You have planted a seed of revenge.
    <br>You want that guy who has done nothing wrong to be implicated for something you did
    <br>just to cover up the fact that you ate someone's sandwich
    <br>and the mountain is growing taller.
    <br>He looks at you again and says, "Are you sure you don't know about this sandwich?
    <br>I can see a crumb of a sandwich here. Are you sure you don't know?"
    <br>"Look! I don't know anything about it. I don't even eat sandwiches, it is not good for me."
    <br>What have you just done?
    <br>Selfishness.
    <br>Here we go again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>For the sake of a sandwich, your sin has piled up like a mountain between you and God.
    <br>The person says, "Right. I'm going to go and meet the manager. Let me leave."
    <br>He leaves, shuts the door.
    <br>You, that is here, say, "Uh, I got away with that one."
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You may have got away with it in the flesh but you did not get away with it in the spirit.
    <br>Your sin has piled up like a mountain between you and God
    <br>for the sake of covering up your wrong.
    <br>Instead of you just to say, "Yes, I was the one",
    <br>instead of to listen to your conscience, your heart,
    <br>you have gone from one to another and the road continues.
    <br>What happens now when you have this barrier, blockage between you and God?
    <br>Your heart becomes dead; your spiritual life becomes stagnant
    <br>and your purpose in life goes unfulfilled because sin is a spiritual thing.
    <br>No amount of human cover-up can overcome the power of sin.
    <br>No amount of human wisdom and intelligence can design an antidote to the poison of sin.
    <br>Sin can never be covered by our appearance, by our presence, by our prayers, by our tears.
    <br>Sin can only be removed by repentance.
    <br>Look at the case of David and Bathsheba in 2 Samuel 11.
    <br>You know the story.
    <br>David fell into sin, lusted after Bathsheba, he committed adultery
    <br>and instead of him to quickly listen to his heart, conscience and acknowledge his wrong,
    <br>he tried to cover up his wrong.
    <br>He called the husband, Uriah back from the battle field.
    <br>He tried to entice him with alcohol so that he would go and meet his wife
    <br>so that his own sin would be covered up.
    <br>By the time this man refused, David ended up ordering the murder on Bathsheba's husband Uriah
    <br>just to cover up his sin.
    <br>Each attempt to cover up your wrong leads you down a path of greater wrong.
    <br>People of God,
    <br>you may try to dull, dim, drown-out that prompting of your conscience.
    <br>Many of us have different ways of achieving this.
    <br>Some of us pursue fleshly desires because of that burden in our hearts,
    <br>"Let me just enjoy myself. I can create happiness for myself.
    <br>I can remove that burden on the inside."
    <br>You watch comedy to force yourself to laugh.
    <br>You watch that movie, soap opera to escape from reality
    <br>but in your attempt to satisfy your senses, you only seem to heap more coals on the fire.
    <br>Afterwards your conscience still disturbs you.
    <br>Many of us try to justify ourselves, "It's not that bad."
    <br>We try to use human reason, we respond with reason, intellect, brain power,
    <br>"Oh, in this 21st century - there are many things in the Bible that do not apply to this generation.
    <br>Come on, it is not that bad. All my friends at school are doing this.
    <br>Nothing is happening to them. Let me just try."
    <br>We try to convince ourselves that there is nothing wrong,
    <br>despite the fact that our conscience is prompting us.
    <br>Some of us are worried about human repercussions,
    <br>"If they find out, my parents will be very angry with me.
    <br>If they find out I did this, I could lose my job.
    <br>If they find out, perhaps I will get into trouble with my school. Let me cover it up."
    <br>You may get away with it in the natural but you cannot get away with it in the spirit.
    <br>It stands as a barrier between you and God, as a blockage between you and God.
    <br>When you pray, people around you may hear you but God is not hearing you.
    <br>He who conceals his sin shall not prosper.
    <br>People of God, I hope you understand the message I'm conveying to you today.
    <br>Let me ask you this probing question:
    <br>Are you moving forward in your spiritual life?
    <br>Everyday the clock is ticking, in a matter of days we will enter a new year, our age is increasing.
    <br>Are you moving forward in your spiritual life?
    <br>Because if the answer is no, something is before you.
    <br>The psalmist says, "I know my transgressions for my sin is always before me."
    <br>When sin is before you, you cannot see any other thing except the fruit of sin:
    <br>fear, discouragement, defeat, pain.
    <br>Discouragement when sin is before you.
    <br>Question number 2:
    <br>What is the state of your heart in the face of your trouble?
    <br>Everyone faces trouble but the state of your heart determines how you respond -
    <br>whether in faith or in fear.
    <br>If sin is before you and your heart is troubled,
    <br>indeed your trouble is troubling.
    <br>But if your heart is settled even in the midst of trouble,
    <br>as a child of God, you know that your case is settled.
    <br>As I bring this message to a conclusion, I want you to examine your own life.
    <br>If you sincerely do so, I believe you will come to the realisation
    <br>that covering up your wrong simply does not work.
    <br>What you think you get away with today, will come back to get you tomorrow.
    <br>What you cover up today, will be uncovered tomorrow.
    <br>Luke 12:2 says it:
    <br>"There is nothing that is concealed that will not be disclosed,
    <br>or hidden that will not be make known."
    <br>What many of us are facing right now are the repercussions of what we covered up in the past.
    <br>Cover-up is dangerous.
    <br>LET YOUR CONSCIENCE BE YOUR GUIDE
    <br>We put to you today the Scriptural truth written in Genesis 8:22,
    <br>the law that God has laid down from the beginning of creation -
    <br>"Whatsoever a man sows, that he shall reap."
    <br>When you plant the wrong seed, that is sin - whatever it may be,
    <br>and you cover up that wrong,
    <br>what you are simply doing is watering the seed.
    <br>Each time you cover up your wrong, you are watering the seed of evil
    <br>and what will happen is that it will give birth to the fruits of darkness.
    <br>So, people of God, once again as I bring this message to a conclusion:
    <br>If we make a mistake, as we all do - no one is perfect -
    <br>listen to your conscience; don't run from God, run to Him.
    <br>Christians can make bad mistakes but because they already have a relationship with God,
    <br>they can go to God immediately about their behaviour
    <br>and God Almighty is ready to lift them back up, to forgive them
    <br>and to help them not make the same mistakes again.
    <br>Jesus Christ receives repentant souls;
    <br>He loves them, He welcomes them.
    <br>The worst of sins can be forgiven.
    <br>Let this message encourage you today to look inward.
    <br>And I will close with the Scripture from the Book of Hebrews 10:22-23.
    <br>The Bible says this:
    <br>"Let us draw near to God with a sincere heart
    <br>and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us
    <br>from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
    <br>Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful."
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts, as we listen to our conscience, in Jesus' name.
