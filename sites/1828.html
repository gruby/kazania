    <br>Good Morning and Win Today
    <br>Viewers, Good Morning and Win Today!
    <br>Welcome to Emmanuel TV Studios, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Prayer is the acknowledgement that there is a superior realm that controls and governs
    <br>both the visible and invisible worlds.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua spent his days in prayer at the prayer mountain, remember what he said:
    <br>This prayer is not time-bound.
    <br>Anytime you hear it, the presence of God is maintained
    <br>because the power of God is so real, authentic and forceful
    <br>that it cannot be limited by space, time, or circumstance.
    <br>Yes, let us remember the prayer he offered as we watch the clip.
    <br>Good Morning and Win Today
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua At The Prayer Mountain
    <br>In the name of Jesus, we present the nations, the world at large to you, Lord.
    <br>Forgive them their iniquities. Forgive them their wrongs.
    <br>Forgive them their sins, Lord Jesus.
    <br>There is cure in the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>There is mighty cure; there is mighty healing.
    <br>Heal our land, heal the world!
    <br>Heal them of fear of COVID-19!
    <br>You are the great help, the very help in times of trouble.
    <br>Here is the time.
    <br>Help and rescue the world at large, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Lord Jesus, by the authority of the Scripture, help the world at large,
    <br>help the nations at large!
    <br>Cure them of fear, Lord Jesus!
    <br>Cure the world over fear of this, fear of that!
    <br>COVID-19, this is your end!
    <br>Lord Jesus, You have done it before; do it again, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Good Morning and Win Today
    <br>Remember the words of that powerful prayer: 
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, we present the nations and the world at large into Your hands.
    <br>There is cure in the Blood of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Today we have seen the supernatural impact of the prayer, as nations and the world
    <br>testify of all the healing power of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Testimonies are pouring in from families, healthcare workers, and ministers alike.
    <br>Viewers, we want to take a few minutes now to build your faith as we read these testimonies.
    <br>You can see people have sent their testimonies by email.
    <br>They have sent their pictures; you can see just a couple of the pictures here.
    <br>So we are going to take time to read them out to you now.
    <br>And of course, as you mentioned on the programme last week, COVID-19 is regarded as hell.
    <br>So because of the stigma, we are not going to show you those pictures close up
    <br>but we are going to read these testimonies for the glory of God to build your faith.
    <br>I have the first testimony here and the person concerned is writing from Canada.
    <br>Thank you so much for sending your testimony.
    <br>The email reads thus: "Dear Prophet T.B. Joshua and my lovely Emmanuel TV family,
    <br>I want to thank God for New Brunswick in Canada where my family stays.
    <br>As we prayed with the prophet against COVID-19, God has been faithful. 
    <br>There were 118 cases but after March 27th,
    <br>which viewers will remember was the specific date that Prophet T.B. Joshua mentioned,
    <br>she says that after March 27th, people started recovering.
    <br>And now 112 people have been reported healed.
    <br>On the 2nd of May, that is just last week, all the patients were confirmed healed
    <br>and on Sunday evening, we got the announcement that for three weeks now,
    <br>there have been no new cases of coronavirus in New Brunswick.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>It is surprising that they have said this but we know God answers prayers.
    <br>And we thank God for His faithfulness.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua, for praying for the world; God bless you all.
    <br>And she actually attached a couple of news links from international websites
    <br>just confirming that testimony, that this specific Province in Canada, New Brunswick,
    <br>"to enter third week without any new cases of COVID-19", 
    <br>which our sister is attributing to the goodness of God.
    <br>New Brunswick to enter third week without any new cases of COVID-19
    <br>Coronavirus: All 118 cases of COVID-19 in New Brunswick have now recovered
    <br>God is faithful and our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ is the great Physician.
    <br>Never a sickness He cannot heal.
    <br>I have another one here and I believe this is also a touching testimony from our viewers.
    <br>This is a first email coming from this gentleman
    <br>and he says, man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua please intercede
    <br>for the restoration of the life of one Jehoshaphat,
    <br>who undergoes severe torment as a result of being coronavirus positive.
    <br>May our merciful Jesus intervene in a very desperate situation, amen.
    <br>This very person sent an email back to Emmanuel TV a few days later, saying:
    <br>Emmanuel! Good Morning!
    <br>Thank you so much, man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua, 
    <br>for healing my brother-in-law Jehoshaphat from COVID-19.
    <br>My in-law was in a severe health state after contracting the very awful monster, coronavirus.
    <br>Doctors fought to rescue his life but the situation seemed to be very impossible.
    <br>That is when we resorted to praying with you on Emmanuel TV
    <br>when you were recently at the prayer mountain and also
    <br>when you were ministering prayers to viewers.
    <br>We indeed thank God for His goodness in the life of our brother because after the prayers, 
    <br>God brought about miraculous healing.
    <br>He is no longer in the ICU and today, he is free from COVID-19.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>He can eat on his own and do exercise as usual.
    <br>Thank you so much man of God, Emmanuel TV! Amen.
    <br>That's a wonderful testimony from this person,
    <br>truly telling us that distance is not a barrier for the move of God.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was on the mountain here in Nigeria and they are in another country altogether, 
    <br>a different continent, yet the power of God touched them as they connected by faith.
    <br>It is a wonderful testimony.
    <br>We would like to share another one.
    <br>Let us listen to this one and it is called 'Testimonial'.
    <br>It is from one of our Spanish-speaking viewers and she writes:
    <br>I have been leaving home each day and working without protection because I don't have protection available.
    <br>But I was still keeping to social distancing, washing my hands and taking hygienic measures.
    <br>Then I started to feel a lack of air every morning, I developed difficulty in breathing.
    <br>It was as if something gripped my throat and prevented me from breathing.
    <br>I felt sick, I had throat pain and fever.
    <br>Now she says, my family and I have been praying with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV
    <br>against the coronavirus and declaring that the virus will not touch us.
    <br>I sent my photo where I prayed and I touched the screen of Emmanuel TV
    <br>while Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for us, like millions of viewers around the world do.
    <br>After a week I was tested for coronavirus and it was negative.
    <br>Glory be to God! Just a touch of Jesus Christ made the difference.
    <br>She continues, all the symptoms are gone and I have been worshipping the Lord our God like never before.
    <br>Only God can perform this miracle; thank you, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Who could justly do it but Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
    <br>I have a testimony that is going to make your faith to rise.
    <br>This email came from Nigeria, it says: Good Morning to you all and Win Today.
    <br>My younger brother (name withheld), who happens to be working in one of the banks in Nigeria had COVID-19.
    <br>He had headaches, body pain, breathing complications, and a chronic stuffy nose.
    <br>The symptoms intensified and later he remembered that he had attended 
    <br>the Living Water service at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations
    <br>and collected the living water, which he still had.
    <br>He said, he ministered the living water and was healed.
    <br>Now he can breathe freely. Glory be to God!
    <br>God can use any medium to fulfil His purpose.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>You can see that God can use any medium to express Himself to us;
    <br>we just need to be connected by faith to the living Saviour, Jesus Christ.
    <br>And I would like to read another testimony.
    <br>This time from someone who received their healing through praying along with 
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and taking the lemon water,
    <br>one of the health habits Prophet T.B. Joshua explained to his viewers that he has been taking.
    <br>It's a glass of hot water with three slices of lemon that he said he takes in the morning
    <br>when he is moving around, praying and taking his morning exercise.
    <br>So let us watch the screen of our television to see more about the lemon water.
    <br>Good Morning and Win Today
    <br>My viewers, you deserve what I deserve - this is revelation.
    <br>In the morning, you take a cup of hot water and two lemons.
    <br>Cut them into small slices and put in the cup.
    <br>After three to five minutes, begin to sip it as a drink.
    <br>Refill it three times.
    <br>I will not mind doing it in the exact way.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Demonstrating One Of His Daily Habits - Drinking Hot Water With Lemon
    <br>This is hot water.
    <br>I will advise you to walk around your compound or premises as you are sipping.
    <br>After three to five minutes, sip it as a drink.
    <br>When you are moving and sipping, it helps digestion.
    <br>Refill it three times.
    <br>To show you how effective this is, look at me before.
    <br>And now, look at me!
    <br>Imagine what has been flushed out!
    <br>Irrespective of what is in your system, it will be flushed out!
    <br>I will advise you while sipping it as a drink, move around with it.
    <br>As I have said, it helps digestion - moving around with it.
    <br>If you are not fit enough, sip it and move around with it.
    <br>For those of us that are fit enough, you can still do press-ups
    <br>when you wake up in the morning.
    <br>This is my habit. I am going to demonstrate it.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Demonstrating His Daily Morning Habits.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>So if you are fit, you are advised to do press-ups.
    <br>It energises your system.
    <br>Thank you, viewers, for your time.
    <br>Good Morning and Win Today
    <br>This person writes: It was not funny at all when I developed a serious cough and
    <br>people started keeping their distance.
    <br>As the cough persisted, coupled with tightness of my chest,
    <br>I knew I had contracted the dreaded coronavirus.
    <br>However, the moment I adhered to the counsel of Prophet T.B. Joshua about
    <br>the lemon water,  I got my healing.
    <br>I can simply say the cough just disappeared!
    <br>I now breathe freely, and the stomach problem I also suffered earlier is gone.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus!
    <br>It reminds me, when Prophet T.B. Joshua was saying that now even just a cough has become a crime
    <br>because of this fear of COVID-19 but thank God the monster of fear has been defeated, amen!
    <br>I have another testimony also concerning the hot water with lemon.
    <br>It is a wonderful health habit and this person is writing from Romania in Europe
    <br>and the testimony reads thus: Glory be to God. Greetings to you from Romania.
    <br>This is Marcus; I want to thank the Lord. 
    <br>He has just rescued me from the clutches of the deadly coronavirus.
    <br>For days, I found it difficult to breathe and it seemed as if life was being squeezed out of me.
    <br>I knew I had contracted coronavirus as the symptoms started creeping in
    <br>and just when I was counting my last days on earth...
    <br>(for you viewers to know how critical our brother's situation was)
    <br>...just as I was counting my last days on earth, I saw the clip of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>on Emmanuel TV educating us about the use of this hot water with lemon.
    <br>As I began to take the hot water with lemon and I prayed with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>the symptoms began to fade away. 
    <br>Today I feel healthy and strong, no more coronavirus!
    <br>Thank you, Jesus! And he concludes by saying:
    <br>Thank you Prophet T.B. Joshua, you are a blessing to this generation.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus! What a wonderful testimony.
    <br>Indeed the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
    <br>Testimonies are for the glory of God.
    <br>I have a testimony to share with you; this email comes from the US.
    <br>It says: Good Morning to you and Win Today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I work in a nursing home in Houston, Texas.
    <br>I want to start by thanking God for His answer to the prayers of 
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Team in my life and my colleagues' life too.
    <br>I follow all the divine instructions, praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and I can testify to being under God's protection.
    <br>All the staff did our COVID-19 tests today, May 5th, 2020.
    <br>By the grace of God, nobody tested positive.
    <br>All the glory to Jesus our King. 
    <br>When Jesus says yes, nobody can say no.
    <br>I remember when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for the health workers
    <br>and truly today we have a lot of testimonies from these health workers testifying to the goodness of God.
    <br>I have one here and I want to quickly say here, viewers,
    <br>for those who are health workers, perhaps you have tested positive.
    <br>I want to assure you, there is hope for you.
    <br>We are reading testimonies of those who are healed and who by the grace of God are free
    <br>from this deadly virus COVID-19.
    <br>You also will receive your healing.
    <br>I believe by the time Prophet T.B. Joshua comes to our midst, your life will not remain the same.
    <br>But listen to this testimony because I believe this will encourage you.
    <br>It is also from one of the health workers.
    <br>Dear Prophet T.B. Joshua, I just wanted to come back and say thank you
    <br>for your prayers over doctors and nurses throughout this COVID-19 season.
    <br>My sister is a nurse here in Germany.
    <br>She has dealt directly for weeks with COVID-19 patients,
    <br>even though others were afraid and trying to avoid going close to the patients.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, prayer warriors,
    <br>I want you to know that God's mercy, protection, and grace have been upon my sister.
    <br>She is healthy and has never contracted COVID-19.
    <br>What even astonished me more is the joy and love she has developed during this 
    <br>period to attend to her patients.
    <br>She says that she feels so fulfilled and has developed an unusual inner peace,
    <br>taking care of her patients, and she even wonders why people fear.
    <br>Thank you so much for your prayer, love, and support.
    <br>You see, this is someone that at their hospital, they were tested.
    <br>She was negative; nothing like coronavirus in her case.
    <br>Meaning that the prayers offered by Prophet T.B. Joshua for health workers
    <br>are working and today that is why we are seing testimonies from all these
    <br>nurses and doctors, testifying to the glory of God.
    <br>Jesus is the Healer.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, there is cure in the Blood of Jesus.
    <br>We thank God for these wonderful testimonies that build our faith in a new way.
    <br>Partners, we have a message for you.
    <br>First and foremost, thank you so much.
    <br>We want to appreciate God for your continued commitment
    <br>to the relief of those in need during the lockdown,
    <br>which has affected the lives of millions of people around the world.
    <br>The creation of human beings marks the beginning of society.
    <br>We are not only made in the image and likeness of God;
    <br>we are made to live in community
    <br>where we are expected to manifest the nature of God, the life of God - His love.
    <br>Love is an activator to life.
    <br>Love can change the destiny of a man or a woman if spoken from the heart.
    <br>Love can make a king abdicate his throne.
    <br>Love can make a poor man or a poor boy a prince.
    <br>Above all, love can change the fate of nations.
    <br>Partners in Christ, you are called to be an apostle of giving.
    <br>That is what Jesus meant when He spoke to the disciples in the Book of John 17:18:
    <br>"As the Father sent me, so send I you."
    <br>In other words, Jesus was simply telling them:
    <br>"As the Father has commissioned me to be a solution to someone in trouble, so also I commission you."
    <br>So partners, remember the words of Jesus in the Book of Mathew 5:15-16:
    <br>Let your light shine.
    <br>Good Morning and Win Today
