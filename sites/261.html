    <br>Pastors' Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I want to use the experience I had yesterday
    <br>as the basis of my message today.
    <br>I want to say thank you for your time.
    <br>I know today it will not be, "Man of God, pray for me..."
    <br>Since we know that the pastor, man of God is not the root of faith,
    <br>you cannot just begin to decide and demand for prayer since he is not the root;
    <br>he needs a corresponding power because he is not the source of faith.
    <br>If we are the source of faith, faith would be fragile, weak.
    <br>The source of faith is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Who is the same yesterday, today and forever here?
    <br>Nobody.
    <br>You have a beginning and you have an end.
    <br>I have a beginning; I have an end.
    <br>The One who has no beginning, no end is the same yesterday, today and forever -
    <br>Jesus Christ.
    <br>He is the Source of our faith.
    <br>He is the Giver of our faith.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I am going to take my message from the angle of what I saw yesterday, here -
    <br>man's plan against God's plan.
    <br>Those things can hinder the move of God.
    <br>I am going to take my message from this angle.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of 1 John 5:1.
    <br>"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God"
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>That is, he is born again.
    <br>Meaning, he is born of the Spirit.
    <br>"and everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him
    <br>who is begotten of Him."
    <br>I'm taking verse 2.
    <br>"By this we know that we love the children of God,
    <br>when we love God and keep His commandments.
    <br>For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.
    <br>And His commandments are not burdensome.
    <br>For whatever is born of God overcomes the world.
    <br>And this is the victory that has overcome the world - our faith.
    <br>Who is he who overcomes the world,
    <br>but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"
    <br>Let's go to verse 7 there.
    <br>"For there are three that bear witness in Heaven:
    <br>the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one."
    <br>Verse 14:
    <br>"Now this is the confidence that we have in Him,
    <br>that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us."
    <br>Looking at that verse, if we ask anything according to His will,
    <br>He hears us.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>This means, without God's promises or God's will,
    <br>our faith is no real faith.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I will take my message:
    <br>NOT OUR WILL
    <br>Many people believe that healing, prophecy, deliverance,
    <br>all of God's blessings are wrought by the person concerned.
    <br>You can run to a man of God to heal you without God's will.
    <br>If God has not promised me to pray for you,
    <br>if I force myself to pray for you,
    <br>I'm only dreaming, not believing.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>If it is not God's will for me to pray for you, if I force myself to pray for you,
    <br>I am not believing but dreaming
    <br>because I do not believe in something factual but my own imagination.
    <br>Take note of that; I will take it again.
    <br>If God has not promised, I mean, if it is not God's will for me to pray for you,
    <br>heal and deliver you, if I force myself to pray for you,
    <br>I am not believing but dreaming
    <br>because I do not believe in something factual but my own imagination.
    <br>These are the challenges churches are having today.
    <br>Church, this is about challenges.
    <br>We pray for people because they demand for prayer
    <br>without knowing that there is a corresponding power.
    <br>Without corresponding power, you cannot bring God to the scene.
    <br>Take note; God's blessings require corresponding power.
    <br>Without corresponding power, you cannot bring God to the scene.
    <br>We pastors, born again, ministers of God, these are the challenges we have today.
    <br>We pray for people because they ask for prayer,
    <br>not that God wants us to pray at that particular time.
    <br>God's blessings require corresponding power - power from above.
    <br>The One from above is above all.
    <br>When you look at the Book of John 3:31,
    <br>the One from above is above all.
    <br>Corresponding power.
    <br>A suggestion comes to us from the Spirit that we should perform the act.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>A suggestion comes from the Spirit to us that the action be performed.
    <br>What is the action?
    <br>Healing, deliverance, prophecy.
    <br>A suggestion comes from the Spirit to us that the healing, prophecy, deliverance,
    <br>whatever you want to do for God, be performed.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Every step, every action, every movement - intimation comes from God,
    <br>comes from the Spirit.
    <br>I say, 'God' because God inspires the Spirit to speak.
    <br>God inspires the Spirit to speak.
    <br>Suggestion comes from the Spirit to us that healing, prophecy, deliverance...
    <br>Amen. Thank you.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>When we say, 'suggestion from the Spirit', we are still referring to God's will -
    <br>God's promises about every issue, every matter must be known to us
    <br>before prayer.
    <br>God's promises, I mean, God's way - suggestion from the Spirit -
    <br>because God inspires the Spirit to speak.
    <br>God inspires you.
    <br>NOT OUR WILL
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>God's promises about every matter -
    <br>"Be healed" - God's will about that must be known.
    <br>If you come to me, "Pastor, pray for me", I must know God's will -
    <br>God's promises about that - whether to pray for you or not.
    <br>If not, my prayer would be idle, destructive and meaningless.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>NOT OUR WILL
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>When we know God's will about a matter, we trust Him according to His will.
    <br>If you say, "Pray for me, pastor",
    <br>I need to know God's opinion, God's will, whether to pray for you or not.
    <br>I should not just go into prayer without knowing God's will
    <br>concerning that prayer - whether to pray for you or not -
    <br>whether there is counselling for you or not.
    <br>I must know before I begin to pray for you.
    <br>These are the challenges churches are having today.
    <br>The challenges we have today:
    <br>once I'm a pastor, born again...
    <br>OK, say, "Pray for me".
    <br>"In Jesus' name..."
    <br>Without God's will, our faith will not work; our faith is no real faith.
    <br>When we know God's will concerning an issue or matter,
    <br>we trust God according to His will.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Let's advise ourselves, we ministers of God.
    <br>If you do not have the Word of God, you will have nothing at all.
    <br>Let us advise ourselves.
    <br>If you do not have the Word of God, you will have nothing at all.
    <br>God's promises are in God's Word.
    <br>It is there.
    <br>I want to encourage you.
    <br>Read your Bible slowly because we are always in a hurry.
    <br>We read the Bible as if we are reading literature.
    <br>We read the Bible at a time that is not convenient,
    <br>a time you are facing challenges, a time you are in need,
    <br>a time you are in trouble - that is when you read the Bible.
    <br>We should read our Bible slowly, attentively, repeatedly.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>God's promises are in God's Word.
    <br>How do we know God?
    <br>We know God by the Word He speaks.
    <br>The Word He speaks is His heart's desire.
    <br>The Word God speaks represents His heart's desire.
    <br>Does your word represent your heart's desire?
    <br>When you say, "Be healed" but the person is not healed,
    <br>that means that it is not your heart's desire.
    <br>Your heart's desire is to heal the person.
    <br>You say, "Be healed" and the person is not healed.
    <br>It means, you have not spoken your heart's desire.
    <br>God's Word represents His heart's desire.
    <br>Have you been speaking your heart's desire?
    <br>You open your mouth and say...
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Does this represent your heart's desire?
    <br>Speaking in tongues is a gift of God - a supernatural gift.
    <br>But today it has become...
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>We know God by the Word He speaks
    <br>and the Word He speaks represents His heart's desire.
    <br>What will you have faith in if God has not promised something?
    <br>If God has not promised anything, how can we know that He is faithful?
    <br>He must promise something before we can talk about His faithfulness.
    <br>God's promises are in God's Word.
    <br>Without God's promises, our faith is no real faith.
    <br>Read your Bible slowly, attentively, repeatedly.
    <br>Where the message is personal, insert your name there.
    <br>Repeat it if you don't understand it; underline it.
    <br>The more you think about what you read,
    <br>the more you become familiar with God's voice.
    <br>Sometimes, people say they hear God's voice here.
    <br>No! Here.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Some will say, "He is talking to me. Yes, Father, thank You".
    <br>God's voice is here, not here.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>The more you think about what you read,
    <br>the more familiar you become with His voice.
    <br>Remember, I told you that God's Word represents His heart's desire.
    <br>The more you think about what you read,
    <br>the more your spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>OK, let me take you to the book so that you will see your spirit and the Word; two must join.
    <br>The Word and the Spirit must join.
    <br>NOT OUR WILL
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>The Word and the Spirit must join or marry.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>The Word and the Spirit must join.
    <br>The Word and the Spirit must join before you can speak for God.
    <br>Before you can speak for Him and represent Him and say, "Be healed"
    <br>and the person would be healed, "Be delivered" and the person is delivered,
    <br>"Be saved" and the person is saved,
    <br>the Word and the Spirit must join - marry.
    <br>Today, we are facing challenges: we speak the Word without the Spirit.
    <br>Let's go to the Book of 1 John.
    <br>It says here:
    <br>"Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will..."
    <br>Whose will?
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>God is Spirit and His worshippers worship Him in Spirit and truth.
    <br>It means, the Spirit makes us know that believing is possessing.
    <br>Without the Spirit, your believing cannot possess.
    <br>If I believe to heal you without the Spirit of God, I will speak of myself.
    <br>I'm dreaming.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>The instant you believe, you possess.
    <br>The instant you believe, you receive.
    <br>You may mentally assent and never have.
    <br>You may hope and never have.
    <br>The instant you believe, it is yours.
    <br>But take note:
    <br>the Spirit of the Father makes us know, reveals the revelation,
    <br>the insight that believing is possessing.
    <br>I was talking of encouragement.
    <br>We should read our Bible slowly.
    <br>It is not like other books; it is the Book of books.
    <br>Holy men were inspired to write as they spoke the Word that came from Heaven.
    <br>When you think about what you read,
    <br>the more you think about what you read, the more your spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>Without your spirit acting upon the Word, you are speaking of yourself.
    <br>How do we possess this?
    <br>If the Word dominates your mouth, it will dominate your heart.
    <br>If the Word dominates your heart,
    <br>it will influence your conduct and your character.
    <br>When the Word dominates your mouth and you keep it in your mouth
    <br>and meditate on it, it goes down to your heart -
    <br>you begin to do what the Word says.
    <br>If the Word does not dominate your heart, you cannot do what the Word says.
    <br>You only confess it but are not a doer of the Word.
    <br>When it dominates your heart, you do what the Word says.
    <br>Meditation in the Word is a visit to God.
    <br>When the Word dominates your heart and it becomes a part of you, by its nature it changes you.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>When it dominates your heart, by its nature,
    <br>it changes you to what God wants you to be.
    <br>When we speak the Word while praying, preaching, teaching,
    <br>not according to God's Spirit, it would be idle,
    <br>meaningless and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>Can you see the Spirit of God, corresponding power I'm talking about?
    <br>Corresponding power.
    <br>Many express the desire to be filled with the Spirit of God.
    <br>I want to advise you and tell you something.
    <br>You must be grounded in the Word before you are filled,
    <br>else there would be nothing there for the Spirit of God to remind you of.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of John 14:26.
    <br>"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name,
    <br>He will teach you all things,
    <br>and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you."
    <br>If there is nothing for the Spirit of God to remind you of,
    <br>how will you be there for God Almighty?
    <br>How will you be a servant of God?
    <br>You want to be filled.
    <br>You must be grounded in the Word of God before you are filled,
    <br>else there will be nothing for the Spirit of God to remind you of.
    <br>God uses those who have been rooted in the Word,
    <br>rooted in His language
    <br>and those who seek His face.
    <br>God uses those who have sought His face,
    <br>not His hand,
    <br>but those who sought His face, not His hand.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Not those who carry Bible; "Pastor..."
    <br>Those who have sought His face, not those who sought His hand.
    <br>Now, the most important thing we have talked about.
    <br>Our spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>The Spirit makes us to know that believing is possessing.
    <br>I have just given you summaries of what we were talking about; take note.
    <br>The challenges churches are having today -
    <br>the Word and the Spirit are not joined.
    <br>Until the Word and the Spirit join or marry,
    <br>there can be no signs and wonders.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>We will continue to say, "Be healed, be delivered" but nothing will happen.
    <br>We will continue to say, "It will rain tomorrow" but nothing.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>The Spirit and the Word must join.
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>The Spirit of the Father will be released to the degree,
    <br>to the measure we stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>This means, there are stages.
    <br>Meaning, there are classes -
    <br>pastor - deep; pastor - deeper; pastor - deepest.
    <br>Bishop - deep; bishop - deeper; bishop  - deepest.
    <br>Evangelist - deep; evangelist - deeper; evangelist - deepest.
    <br>Christians all over the world, born again - deep, deeper, deepest.
    <br>At which stage are you?
    <br>The Spirit of the Father will be released
    <br>to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>If it is the degree, it will be released to that degree.
    <br>Some degree will be deep, deeper, deepest.
    <br>When you say, "Let there be light!"...
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Some will receive light tomorrow,
    <br>some will receive next week,
    <br>some will not receive light - it will be dim,
    <br>while some say, "Let there be light" - they will see light now.
    <br>Stop envying and being jealous of yourselves.
    <br>If someone is in 'deep', don't be jealous of 'deeper'.
    <br>If someone is in 'deepest', you 'deeper', don't be jealous of 'deepest'.
    <br>Keep pressing.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Something is going through your mind.
    <br>You want to ask at which stage I am.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I am free to tell you.
    <br>You want to hear.
    <br>People are in 'deep', people are in 'deeper';
    <br>no one in this world is in 'deepest'.
    <br>I am not in 'deepest'; I am in 'deeper'.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I'm not in 'deepest'.
    <br>We are in a world without faith and hope.
    <br>We are just moving every day...
    <br>I'm not in the deepest, I'm in 'deeper', just like you.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>That is why I'm pressing...
    <br>Running a straight race, fighting a good fight.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I know many people are waiting for a touch.
    <br>You need maintenance.
    <br>This message will help you to maintain the blessing you are receiving.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Finally,
    <br>a group of pastors came to talk to me about the issue of faith
    <br>because of what was happening in their ministry.
    <br>They believed they had little faith.
    <br>I said to them, "If you want to have great faith,
    <br>you need to have a Great God".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you want to have great faith, you need to have a Great God".
    <br>I said to them, "It was not your faith that was too little but your god".
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>"It was not your faith that was too little but your god was too little
    <br>because your god is the source of your faith;
    <br>your god is the giver of your faith."
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>What is faith?
    <br>Faith means committing yourself and your things
    <br>to Someone wiser, cleverer and more powerful than you.
    <br>Who is more powerful than you?
    <br>G-O-D.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>It is not possible for someone to stretch hand and you see people vomiting, getting healed...
    <br>God wants to use me to impart anointing to you,
    <br>I must be able to be grounded with the message, "How come about this anointing?
    <br>What is the meaning of anointing?"
    <br>Such a person must be grounded in the Word of God
    <br>because God's promises are only in God's Word.
    <br>What I am carrying are the promises of God.
    <br>Therefore, without the promises of God, there is no God's Word.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>It is not possible for God to send someone who has a gift of healing, prophecy, deliverance,
    <br>and he will not be able to explain God better, "What is He doing?"
    <br>He wouldn't be able to explain it.
    <br>It is like a chemistry, biology, mathematics master who is sound practically.
    <br>There is no mathematics teacher or professor who is sound, grounded,
    <br>that would not be able to explain himself literally.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Once again.
    <br>Faith means committing yourself and your things to Someone else
    <br>who is wiser - Jesus;
    <br>who is cleverer - Jesus;
    <br>who is smarter - Jesus;
    <br>who is more powerful - Jesus!
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>When you talk of believing...
    <br>Believing in God means committing yourself and your things to God
    <br>and trusting Him to accomplish them for you.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I know, whatever will happen any moment from now, you know the Source.
    <br>You know the power you are under.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I know the power I am under".
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>If God has not promised, ordered, instructed or commanded me to come
    <br>to Korea and impart the blessing of God to the ministers here,
    <br>if I force myself to come, I am not believing but dreaming
    <br>because I do not believe in something factual but my own imagination.
    <br>So, I'm here by command of God.
    <br>I was instructed to come here.
    <br>By the instruction of God, I am here.
    <br>Without God's promises, no real faith.
    <br>There are God's promises - now it is time to deliver it.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I have a word of advice for the churches all over the world.
    <br>Healing, deliverance, prophecy and all of God's blessings are hindered by money.
    <br>It is not possible to heal people and collect money.
    <br>It is not possible because of corresponding power;
    <br>we cannot deliver and receive money.
    <br>That delivering gift is not for sale.
    <br>When it is time to heal, it is time to give what God has given us.
    <br>Today, you can see the church all over the world,
    <br>you can see that the age of healing, deliverance and prophecy seems to have passed.
    <br>It has not passed; Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>It is money -
    <br>those gifts are not for sale.
    <br>NOT OUR WILL
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>God will send His people, the helpers who will support our nation, who will support us.
    <br>When we give freely, God will raise people, partners all over the world,
    <br>who will give and bless the ministry, bless you abundantly.
    <br>Let this come from the heart of the congregation.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>These are the challenges I have.
    <br>I find it difficult to begin to travel all over the world for revival because of this challenge of money.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Before, I was travelling from country to country but when I discovered the challenges of money -
    <br>money hindered the blessing, healing and deliverance.
    <br>Even if the richest man in the world is sick and you pray for him,
    <br>don't  collect anything; don't expect anything from him.
    <br>Let it come from his heart whatever he is giving
    <br>so that it will not look as if healing is for sale.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I stopped travelling from country to country for the past 5 years
    <br>when I saw the challenges.
    <br>I realised that the gift of God that was coming from me was not completely delivered.
    <br>I was asking what the cause was of not being able to deliver ninety percent of the gift.
    <br>The Lord said to me that money was the hindrance.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>In those years when I was moving from one country to another,
    <br>when I stretched hand, "This is the will of God to heal this man" - there was hindrance.
    <br>I said, "God, what is this?"
    <br>"This person you are praying for - they have collected money from him.
    <br>Do you want to sell the gift?"
    <br>"No, Sir!"
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I know we have many things we need to do with money.
    <br>A place for the revival needs to be hired - fine; that is good.
    <br>Lighten everything, management - fine.
    <br>The sick people - people who are really in need of salvation, healing, miracle, deliverance -
    <br>we should be very careful that before they receive those things,
    <br>there should be no exchange of money for healing; this should be given.
    <br>When you give people freely, people will surprise you.
    <br>They will give you what you are not expecting.
    <br>When you ask someone who is sick to give you something, he will give you.
    <br>If you ask him before - 5 000; he may give you billion when he is well, for thanksgiving.
    <br>That kind of thanksgiving is what God asks from us.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>When it is time for revival or crusade, it is time to hear the will of God.
    <br>If it is the will of God for revival, what to use, money to spend -
    <br>the Lord will provide it in a big way - not from the sick ones or people coming
    <br>but God will provide it in a wonderful way.
    <br>I asked God that before I begin to move for revival,
    <br>I want Him to raise my standard, financially so that anywhere I go,
    <br>I want to support them with fifty percent of whatever they spend.
    <br>My partners and I all over the world are ready to do this.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>This will reduce the hindrance, trouble that is against the gift of God.
    <br>Fifty percent - I and my partners all over the world.
    <br>As God Almighty will not want me to stand here and begin to say, "Give me money..."
    <br>Also my partners all over the world will not want me to say, "I need money".
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Once again.
    <br>I and my partners all over the world...
    <br>Fifty percent of whatever you might have spent to make this pastors' conference
    <br>wonderful and beautiful - financially, we are ready to donate this.
    <br>So, from your own angle fifty percent, from us fifty percent - thank you very much.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>If there is any area the money came from that is against God's promises -
    <br>it is not too late to return it.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let us rise up and pray first - the message we received - we need to pray for God's guidance.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea 
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Open your lips and ask God,
    <br>Holy Spirit, make me Your disciple. Sanctify my heart.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Holy Spirit, make me Your disciple. Sanctify my heart.
    <br>Prayer!

    <br>In Jesus' name we pray!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Sanctification of your heart is for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Open your lips again with all your soul and spirit.
    <br>You have seen how the Word of God is working in the Spirit,
    <br>how the Spirit of God is working in the Spirit,
    <br>how the name of Jesus is working in the Spirit,
    <br>how the power of anointing is working in the Spirit.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Holy Spirit, make me Your disciple. Oh Lord, sanctify my heart.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>Holy Spirit, make me Your disciple. Oh Lord, sanctify my heart.

    <br>Amen!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I'm a disciple of Jesus".
    <br>I am a disciple of Jesus because my heart has been sanctified.
    <br>Hallelujah! You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I pray for your resurrection and deliverance.
    <br>It is the will of God for you to be delivered.
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pastors all over the world,
    <br>I know thousands of ministers of God are under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>receive impartation!
    <br>Be increased, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The grace to be increased and expanded in ministry
    <br>and the gift of God has been given to you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>It is the will of God to increase you.
    <br>It is the will of God to expand your territory.
    <br>Your territory in the Kingdom business has been expanded, in the name of Jesus!
