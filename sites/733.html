  <p>    
    <br>You are a minister of God.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>Don't give up.
    <br>God loves you, please.
    <br>I know you are facing so much, what you are facing is not even persecution;
    <br>it's destruction and has given you a name that you use evil powers.
    <br>Don't give up because you are in-between to leave the ministry and rest.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>He is in-between to leave the ministry.
    <br>You have branches in many places but you are in-between saying,
    <br>"I want to handover for somebody to continue, I want to leave the ministry."
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>You think you have gotten to the cross-roads; left for you, this is the way you see the whole thing.
    <br>Don't give up, sir.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>What is the cause of these thoughts?
    <br>The cause of the thoughts is that I have ministers under me.
    <br>In December, three ministers fell into the river when they were baptising converts and they died.
    <br>In your ministry?
    <br>In my ministry and then the people said that I bewitched those ministers.
    <br>That you are the one who killed them, that you used evil powers?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This man is a man of God; the trouble just came like that.
    <br>He is not using evil powers.
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>He is not using evil powers.
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>While the prayer was going on, I saw someone across -
    <br>"This man wants to leave the ministry, the ministry you have been in right from young age
    <br> and you have been the minister of God, God has planted the ministry into many places."
    <br>They say they will kill me.
    <br>They said they would kill you?
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>Ok, it's alright.
    <br>We will discuss that. 
    <br>No problem.
    <br>I'm seeing you as a minister of God, nobody can kill you.
    <br>There is no trace of evil in you.
    <br>They went for baptism and the three of them fell inside the river and died.
    <br>Three ministers of God and they said you are a wizard.
    <br>Are you the wife?
    <br>Yes, sir, I'm the wife.
    <br>I praise God for delivering him.
    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>I am Archbishop Andrew Ndubano from Botswana.
    <br>I belong to the St. John's Apostolic Faith Mission of Botswana.
    <br>The lady standing next to me is my wife.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>I'm a Lady Archbishop of St. John's Apostolic Faith Mission of Botswana.
    <br>You are welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you tell us, what was the message of prophecy given to you today by Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>I am in Lagos, Nigeria at The SCOAN.
    <br>Today is my day.
    <br>I have been very much amazed.
    <br>The prophet has been going around, picking out people and prophesying to them.
    <br>But to my greatest dismay, he came to me, held my hand and said,
    <br>"You are a man of God, you have a ministry.
    <br>Now you are facing destruction;
    <br>they labelled you that you have killed the three ministers".
    <br>You are a minister of God.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>Don't give up.
    <br>God loves you, please.
    <br>I know you are facing so much, what you are facing is not even persecution;
    <br>it's a destruction and that has given you a name that you used evil powers.
    <br>"I am declaring that you are innocent and there is nothing to bother you, or to worry you
    <br>as you have the intention of leaving the church."
    <br>Don't give up because you are in-between to leave the ministry and rest.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>This man is a man of God; the trouble just came like that.
    <br>He is not using evil powers.
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>What happened is that one of the branches with its own ministers decided to go
    <br>and baptize people on that particular date.
    <br>I was not informed of the day of the baptism;
    <br>I only got a shock when I was phoned 
    <br>that I had bewitched the three ministers that had drowned.
    <br>I had no knowledge of what could have happened.
    <br>The prophecy is excellent.
    <br>We thank God.
    <br>Finally, what decision are you going to take now after this prophecy?
    <br>After the prophecy, that the prophet proved beyond reasonable doubt that I'm innocent...
    <br>He prophesied that I wanted to abandon my church
    <br>and now I'm not going to abandon the ministry as I started it.
    <br>I am now strengthened by the prophecy of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I am going to stay in the church until I die.
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank you so much for this wonderful confirmation of the prophecy.
    <br>We give thanks to God for your life and for your ministry
    <br>and we pray that God will give you that grace
    <br>to make His word the standard for your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus.
