    <br>"My Wife REFUSES To Sleep With Me..."
    <br>Where is your wife?
    <br>I want to see you people because there is 'cat and rat'.
    <br>It is true, Man of God.
    <br>- 'Cat and rat'.
    <br>- It is true, Man of God.
    <br>Who is the cause of this 'cat and rat'?
    <br>She is the cause.
    <br>- She is the cause.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Who is the cause of 'cat and rat'?
    <br>- I don't know.
    <br>She says she does not know but you say she is the one.
    <br>She is the one, sir.
    <br>- Who is the cause of 'cat and rat'?
    <br>- I don't know.
    <br>OK, I am the cause.
    <br>Somebody must take the blame.
    <br>- This is a marriage from God.
    <br>- Thank you, sir.
    <br>But there is a big challenge.
    <br>There was a time she threatened to leave the house.
    <br>Many times.
    <br>The marriage has not been enjoying the dividend of marriage.
    <br>Don't listen to your people because they are taking this issue very seriously.
    <br>Very seriously.
    <br>Because you are the edge to your parents.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Don't listen to them.
    <br>Did you listen to me?
    <br>Did you tell your husband that there is a man you normally see in your dreams?
    <br>- I have told him that.
    <br>- You told him?
    <br>Yes, she told me.
    <br>- That she used to see a man?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Once this man has an affair with her, she does not want you to sleep with her at all.
    <br>She would never call me, not even for one day.
    <br>For many months now, there is no relationship, nothing.
    <br>Sometimes, you'd sleep in the sitting room and she'd sleep inside the room.
    <br>It is true, Man of God.
    <br>Because that man has taken over your position.
    <br>It is spiritual.
    <br>That is it; I want to see you people.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>I am Princess Vivian Okeke.
    <br>I graduated from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in Public Administration and Local Government.
    <br>I am from a royal family in Imo State.
    <br>On Monday service, the man of God came to my husband and asked him, "Where is your wife?"
    <br>I stood up.
    <br>The man of God said he was seeing 'cat and rat'
    <br>and that there had never been peace in the family.
    <br>He said that I had a spiritual husband that would always come to me in my dreams
    <br>and that whenever he came to me, I would not have affection for my husband.
    <br>I confirm this prophecy to be true because ever since we got married,
    <br>there has never been peace in the family.
    <br>My husband blames me, accusing me of being the cause of his downfall.
    <br>Whenever he has setback in his business, he blames it on me.
    <br>Whenever he does anything and it doesn't go well, he says it is my fault.
    <br>My husband is also an evangelist.
    <br>He never sees anything good in me.
    <br>Even when I try my best as a woman, he still sees faults and finds something to say.
    <br>You know, you are a princess and evangelist,
    <br>and princess and evangelist don't talk too much.
    <br>Leave the rest for your husband.
    <br>My name is Ifeanyi Chukwu Charles Okeke.
    <br>I am an evangelist.
    <br>I preach the Word of God.
    <br>On Monday service, the man of God came to me and asked me where my wife was.
    <br>I said, "This is my wife."
    <br>He said that we lived as 'cat and rat'.
    <br>I said he was 100% correct because this is the issue that brought us here.
    <br>Man of God, what you prophesied is true.
    <br>I got married to my wife 13 years ago.
    <br>Two days before the wedding, my wife came and said she was no longer interested in marriage.
    <br>I had to be on my knees, begging my wife that we should go ahead with the wedding,
    <br>and that she should not put aside this wedding as we had prepared so much.
    <br>I told her people were watching us, that we should go ahead and have this wedding.
    <br>Since we started living as husband and wife, we don't co-exist at all;
    <br>we just live like two separate entities.
    <br>We don't come together; we don't stay in a house like husband and wife.
    <br>In the night, I go to my wife and say, "Let us stay as husband and wife".
    <br>My wife will never accept.
    <br>For the last 13 years, I've been begging my wife.
    <br>If I get annoyed as a man and say I will not go to my wife for one month,
    <br>she will be so happy to even stay away for three months.
    <br>Salute this man!
    <br>I say you should salute him.
    <br>Mister went to marry a princess.
    <br>Not only just princess by name; in appearance, she is princess indeed.
    <br>Go ahead.
    <br>Not only that, Man of God.
    <br>She is a real princess.
    <br>In the home, she doesn't cook very well.
    <br>If she brings food, there will be no salt and I keep on telling her,
    <br>"Why did you not put salt in this food?"
    <br>She keeps bringing trouble in the house and we keep fighting.
    <br>How does she cook?
    <br>With no salt, Man of God, sometimes.
    <br>Man of God, sometimes, my mother will come and the same thing will happen.
    <br>My mother will keep on complaining.
    <br>I will tell her to meet my mother to teach her some things and there will be trouble again.
    <br>But not only that. I know, you are the one doing many jobs at home.
    <br>Yes, Man of God, I go to the market.
    <br>Sometimes, you try to cook, sometimes, you wash.
    <br>I do all those things, Man of God. I even go to the market and buy small things.
    <br>Take it easy. You should know; she is a princess.
    <br>You should have somebody to cook.
    <br>You have princess.
    <br>You should have somebody to wash.
    <br>And if you don't have somebody to wash, to cook, you will do cooking yourself,
    <br>you will do washing yourself.
    <br>You that wants to carry a princess to the house,
    <br>you should be ready to have everybody to do the job.
    <br>And if you are not ready to have everybody to do the job, you do the job yourself,
    <br>because she is a princess.
    <br>Because princess was brought up with silver and gold.
    <br>From home.
    <br>Right from baby, they have to put food on the table, wash the clothes,
    <br>everything comes on the table just like that.
    <br>Princess is just to sit down and...
    <br>"My Wife REFUSES To Sleep With Me..."
    <br>Man of God, not only that;
    <br>when we want to pray in the house, she will begin to sleep.
    <br>Even when we call the children and ask her to pray
    <br>or if she wants to read her Bible, she will sleep.
    <br>If she wants to pray, she will begin to sleep and start murmuring something;
    <br>before you know it, she will fall asleep.
    <br>This has affected the family so much.
    <br>Let me tell you the way and manner king and princess - the way they pray.
    <br>Hardly you will see any king saying, "In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>King will not pray like that.
    <br>King will say...
    <br>But my brother - "In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>But princess...
    <br>Because Jesus knows they are princesses and He knows they are queens.
    <br>Due to these problems of laziness and not doing things well,
    <br>last month we had a big quarrel at home.
    <br>I then decided that she should come for deliverance.
    <br>When she came for deliverance, she spent more than three weeks.
    <br>When I watched to see her deliverance, she would not appear.
    <br>One night she called me and asked me if I knew who she was.
    <br>She then told me that she was a queen of the coast.
    <br>I began shivering.
    <br>I said, "Just try and go."
    <br>Because each time she is annoyed in the house...
    <br>But when she told you she was the queen of the coast,
    <br>how did you feel?
    <br>I was so afraid...
    <br>Did that affect your love towards her?
    <br>It did not affect my love towards her.
    <br>Did that affect your love towards her?
    <br>No.
    <br>That's all.
    <br>Love is blind.
    <br>Man of God, I love my wife so much.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>You should not say more than that.
    <br>What you have said now has ruled out, cancelled everything,
    <br>whether you are the one cooking at home, washing at home -
    <br>the last word has cancelled it all.
    <br>He said, "I love my wife so much."
    <br>I want to meet you people.
    <br>All what you are doing - you need deliverance and your wife also needs deliverance.
    <br>After the deliverance we can talk of reconciliation.
    <br>You are not from the palace, and you walked into the palace and married.
    <br>That urge to go to the palace and marry in the palace -
    <br>from outside, you entered the palace and married in the palace -
    <br>you need to be delivered before you can marry in the palace.
    <br>And for the palace to marry you, palace needs to be delivered.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I want to join your family.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>No, I'm not going to give you a handshake, I'm going to give the princess.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I will meet you, we will have a discussion, so you can come for testimony.
    <br>And I know princess too loves you so much.
    <br>The upbringing is not something we can suddenly change overnight.
    <br>She is a good woman.
    <br>So, that is it.
    <br>He prefers the company of outsiders to the family.
    <br>He tells people outside everything that happens to the family.
    <br>He cannot fight princess, he has to call people to fight the princess.
    <br>"My Wife REFUSES To Sleep With Me..."
    <br>If you are fighting a big person, you have to report it to the whole world, "Please help me."
    <br>He is afraid, "Princess! From royal family."
    <br>If you report to the palace, he is in trouble.
    <br>That is why he has to tell the whole Nigeria.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Come on, give me your hand.
    <br>Let's go.
