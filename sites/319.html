  <p>    
    <br>During the Sunday Service at The SCOAN, Wise Man Racine begins to move in the midst of the congregation,
    <br>praying for the people in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Where the lightning of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>As Wise Man Racine continues to pray, everything that is hidden
    <br>is being exposed by the light of God.
    <br>Satan is powerless in the face of God's armour and weapons.
    <br>See the reaction of this lady, as the power of God is at work
    <br>uprooting everything contrary in her life.
    <br>Where the power of God is, deliverance is just like breathing.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Stand up and talk!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Who are you, in the name of Jesus?!
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>The spirit of prostitution.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>Explain, how do you operate in her life.
    <br>This one - she is useless.
    <br>I have been in her since birth.
    <br>She has been prostituting for four years.
    <br>Four years and she is just 21 years old.
    <br>What have you done to the family?
    <br>Her family?
    <br>I killed her father in the year 2000 so that I could make use of this thing called a body.
    <br>The mother is just there - poor, abject poverty.
    <br>This one sells her body to feed her mother, grandmother, elder ones and her siblings.
    <br>I am not through; I still have more.
    <br>What else have you done to her?
    <br>I want to kill her.
    <br>I want her junior ones, the girls to do the same thing.
    <br>As for the boys, they will suffer until their death.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>I entered her from birth.
    <br>From birth...
    <br>You wicked demon, in the name of Jesus Christ - come out!
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Come out. Be cast out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Out!
    <br>Be cast out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>I was standing there.
    <br>Do you remember what you said?
    <br>I didn't say anything. I just walked down to this place.
    <br>That evil spirit that was destroying your life and career, Jesus has cast it out today.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>- Stand up.
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Now, you are free; live your life without sin and follow Jesus.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ifekoya Adejoke, I'm 21 years old.
    <br>I am from Lagos State, Epe precisely.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>When my dad died, his family blamed my mother as responsible for the death of my dad.
    <br>They left us with her and ever since then she has been the one taking care of us.
    <br>During my secondary school days, it was very difficult for me to go to school.
    <br>She tried all she could but there was no one to assist her.
    <br>She did the best she could.
    <br>I started trading, selling pure water and I studied to be a hair stylist.
    <br>I am a hair stylist by profession.
    <br>I studied and graduated in Ikeja.
    <br>One fateful day, a lady came to my shop
    <br>and saw me styling somebody's hair and admired it.
    <br>When I was done, she came to me and said that there was a country that she stayed in,
    <br>that if she took me to that country, I could make money and be able to cater for my family.
    <br>I was very happy.
    <br>My happiness knew no bounds.
    <br>I said, "Finally, an angel has come."
    <br>I did not know that she was a devil in human clothing.
    <br>She told me to get an international passport within three days;
    <br>so that I could travel at the end of that week.
    <br>I wanted to tell my mum but I thought again that I would surprise her
    <br>and not tell her or anybody anything.
    <br>When I got there, I would call her with an international number and she would be happy.
    <br>At the weekend, she called me and said that I should come and meet her.
    <br>I left without even finding out about her.
    <br>I just didn't want to know anything about her. So, I followed her.
    <br>When we were going, we travelled by road.
    <br>So, she said that we would get to a country and the country was Libya.
    <br>She said that when we got to that country, we would board a flight there
    <br>which she said would take us to the foreign country, which was Spain.
    <br>When I got to Spain, I would start as a hairstylist.
    <br>I followed her.
    <br>When we got to Libya - we travelled by road,
    <br>we travelled through the Sahara Desert.
    <br>Brethren, it was very terrible.
    <br>SEXUAL SLAVERY VICTIM SPEAKS OUT!!!
    <br>While we were travelling from inside the Hilux where we were packed, we were seeing dead bodies.
    <br>There was no water; there was no food.
    <br>I saw young girls - 11 years old, 12 years old.
    <br>I saw young people; I saw young men.
    <br>Even the vehicle that was following us directly passed on top of a buried bomb
    <br>and everybody there died; the vehicle just exploded.
    <br>Some had accidents.
    <br>Rebels stole some vehicles and they beat people up, raped people
    <br>but to God be the glory, nothing happened to our vehicle and we got to the country.
    <br>When we got to the country, we went to the state capital which is Tripoli, Libya.
    <br>When we got there, she took me to a duplex.
    <br>When we got there, I met five Nigerian girls - they were half-naked.
    <br>When I entered the building, the girls were staring at me.
    <br>They were conversing between themselves.
    <br>I don't know what they were saying.
    <br>The lady asked me to sit down.
    <br>When I sat down, I saw the girls and men were coming in.
    <br>They were going outside and interacting.
    <br>I went inside and called the woman.
    <br>I asked her what was happening here,
    <br>she should explain to me and that I didn't understand what was happening.
    <br>She said that I should not worry, I should go back and later, she would explain to me.
    <br>I went back.
    <br>In the evening, when we had taken a bath and eaten, she called me again.
    <br>I told her that I was seeing some things and I didn't even know how
    <br>to say what they were, she should just tell me.
    <br>She asked, "Didn't you say you were a stylist?"
    <br>I said, "Yes."
    <br>She said, "This is the salon; you should go and resume work; start working."
    <br>I said, "What?"
    <br>She said yes and that I should go and ask those girls -
    <br>all of them were stylists and they were doing the job.
    <br>I went outside and saw the girls.
    <br>I asked one of them and told her what the lady had told me.
    <br>She said, "She brought you here. Yes, just start. This is styling we are doing."
    <br>When the girls told me that, I stood still.
    <br>I told them that even if they'd kill me, over my dead body, I would not join them.
    <br>They just left me and continued what they were doing.
    <br>I sat down there; I didn't even move.
    <br>The following morning, when I woke up, the woman brought some
    <br>underwear for me and said that these were the clothes that I would use to work.
    <br>I said, "Work? I am not working. I didn't come here to do your work;
    <br>I came here to do the work I know how to do."
    <br>She said, "OK, we shall see."
    <br>In the afternoon, people were coming because they saw that I was new
    <br>and they wanted me but I refused.
    <br>So, she went outside and brought canes.
    <br>They beat me up; they really beat me until I was very weak.
    <br>She took me to one of the rooms and tied me there.
    <br>She tied my arms behind my head and tied my legs separately.
    <br>Those people that came to 'work' with the girls would pay her money.
    <br>Then, they would come and meet me inside.
    <br>That very day, 30 men met me in that room where I was tied.
    <br>SEXUAL SLAVERY VICTIM SPEAKS OUT!!!
    <br>After then, she tied me for two weeks.
    <br>After two weeks, the girls came to meet me that if I didn't accept to do this,
    <br>she could tie me here for two years.
    <br>Nobody would ask her; nobody would come and beat her.
    <br>So, I should just accept.
    <br>When I heard that it was like that, I just accepted.
    <br>She told me that I would pay her $9,000 because that was what she used
    <br>to bring me from Nigeria to the country.
    <br>I accepted because I had no choice.
    <br>After eight months, I paid the money and when I had paid the money,
    <br>I wanted to leave the place when the woman told me I was through.
    <br>The month I was planning to leave the place, I started falling sick.
    <br>To my greatest surprise, my womb fell.
    <br>When my womb fell, I was very sick.
    <br>I had to be taken out of the hotel, I was operated upon and my womb was fixed back.
    <br>My point is that at the end of the day, I had no choice,
    <br>I still had to resort to the same thing to come back to Nigeria.
    <br>I am just saying this as a message to the youth
    <br>because this human trafficking comes in different forms.
    <br>This thing happened to me two years ago and I just came back last month.
    <br>They come and deceive our children, most especially the girls.
    <br>They kidnap them from school, tell their parents they want to take them as house help,
    <br>they promise all kinds of things that they can't fulfil
    <br>and at the end of the day, you see young girls dying.
    <br>On the road, you see 12 years old girls, 13 years old girls in brothels;
    <br>they are prostituting by force and by fire.
    <br>You can't complain, you can't do anything and no one will help you.
    <br>I am using this testimony to talk to youth
    <br>and thank God for my life that after everything, I was alive to come back.
    <br>I was tested HIV negative and to the glory of God, I am here today to testify
    <br>to the goodness of God that He has kept me alive to pass this message across to the youth.
    <br>SEXUAL SLAVERY VICTIM SPEAKS OUT!!!
    <br>The lady beside me is my friend.
    <br>When I left the brothel when my womb fell out and I did surgery,
    <br>they fixed it back for me, I wanted to come home but I couldn't because I had no money.
    <br>I went to another brothel to work.
    <br>That was where I met my friend.
    <br>I met her there and I told her my problems; she told me hers too.
    <br>She told me that she wanted to come back to Nigeria and that
    <br>the same way I was lured was the same way she was lured.
    <br>She said that she couldn't find her way and when I was ready, I should go with her.
    <br>When we started discussing and got to know that our problems were similar, we started praying.
    <br>It was at one of our friend's house that we were introduced to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We started watching and praying along with it.
    <br>That was how I met her and we came back from there.
    <br>Even on our way, we had an accident
    <br>when we were coming back through the Sahara Desert.
    <br>Our vehicle caught fire and the driver left us trapped inside the vehicle
    <br>and ran as fast as his legs could carry him.
    <br>We were there praying and calling on the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Brethren, I don't even know how we came out of the vehicle.
    <br>The only thing I knew was that the flames were all over me and I was lifeless.
    <br>By the time I rolled over, I found that I was on the sand.
    <br>I don't know how I came out.
    <br>I turned and the vehicle exploded.
    <br>I was even sure that she had died.
    <br>I didn't know that she had come out through the other side as I came out this side.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Adejoke Ifekoya, I'm from Lagos State, I'm 21 years old.
    <br>I am a hairstylist by profession.
    <br>I want to thank God for my deliverance because my life has not been easy.
    <br>When I was a stylist, I used to work in Ikeja until a lady came to me
    <br>and said that she wanted to help me travel abroad.
    <br>I thought that I wanted to go and look for greener pastures until I got there
    <br>and got to know that it was a different thing entirely.
    <br>I really suffered a lot.
    <br>I really, really suffered a lot and I was frustrated until one day,
    <br>I met a friend who introduced me to Emmanuel TV and I started watching; I started praying with it.
    <br>I started praying with it because I wanted to come and be delivered.
    <br>Finally, I came.
    <br>When I came to the church, Wise Man Racine was praying for the crowd and he came to me.
    <br>When I saw him coming, I wanted to run away
    <br>but something told me to close my eyes and hold still
    <br>so that I wouldn't know when he would come to me.
    <br>The only thing I remember was when I stood up
    <br>and I was told that I was delivered and indeed, I was delivered.
    <br>The urge of sleeping with men for money has gone.
    <br>All I do is read my Bible and pray to God.
    <br>After my deliverance, my life has changed miraculously
    <br>because before it, I didn't use to think.
    <br>Anytime I was alone, I wanted to go out with men and collect money.
    <br>After my deliverance, all I do is stay at home, read my Bible, pray
    <br>and minister my Anointing Water to myself.
    <br>The urge of sleeping with men has gone and it has gone for good, in Jesus' name.
    <br>My advice to people, especially to the youth is to receive
    <br>Jesus Christ as their Lord and personal Saviour because
    <br>if you have Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal Saviour,
    <br>you would be contented with whatever you have.
    <br>Even if poverty strikes you at a stage that you don't expect
    <br>or if anything is leading you to frustration,
    <br>once you have our Lord Jesus Christ, you will pray and the Lord will direct you.
    <br>For the youth that have done what I have done, which is my past,
    <br>those who are still doing it, I want to advise you that you pray to God
    <br>so that God will send a helper who will help you and remove you
    <br>from that dirty thing you are doing.
    <br>It is a very dirty and devilish thing.
    <br>We are selling our bodies to the devil and it is not worth it
    <br>because our bodies are the temple of the Lord.
    <br>I want to encourage your faith because God has done it for me
    <br>and I know that through this church and through Emmanuel TV,
    <br>He will remove you from your dirty works and dirty lies, in Jesus' name.
    <br>After my deliverance, I just came back the way I am, without anything;
    <br>I am crying to the man of God to help me because I don't have anything; I have lost everything.
    <br>I want the man of God to give me direction for my life so that I won't go back to my past again.
    <br>I really want the man of God to help me.
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>The power that flows from His name - the name Jesus
    <br>would be in proportion to our love for His Word.
    <br>It is the Word that is dwelling in you which is the equivalent of Christ personally being in you.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer in faith and love
    <br>and the power of the name "Jesus Christ" flows from his innermost being to heal and deliver the people.
    <br>Let's watch what happens when Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for this young lady in Jesus' name.
    <br>I am the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>I entered her the day of her birth.
    <br>We are two.
    <br>I am the spiritual husband.
    <br>I want to destroy her because if I allow her, she will help her family.
    <br>At just the mention of the name Jesus Christ, she falls on her knees.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Your back on the floor.
    <br>And she is free.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Blessing Ogechi, I'm from Enugu State, I am 20 years old.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>Before now, I was doing prostitution in Libya.
    <br>When I was in Nigeria, one lady came to me that she wanted to help me.
    <br>I thanked God that there would be a change in my family.
    <br>I wanted to help my family.
    <br>I went with the lady and we went through the desert.
    <br>The lady took me to where they call Libya.
    <br>There, she introduced me to prostitution.
    <br>I didn't have any choice because I had no brothers, I didn't have anyone there.
    <br>I had to do prostitution.
    <br>I had been doing prostitution in Libya for about two years.
    <br>I met my friend there in a hotel.
    <br>She explained her situation to me and I explained mine to her.
    <br>A lady introduced us to Emmanuel TV and we started watching it.
    <br>We started praying.
    <br>We were seeing miracles, deliverances and what God is using
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua to do in the people's lives.
    <br>On Thursday, the man of God prayed for me and delivered me from the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>Now, I no longer think of prostituting about to meet men.
    <br>Now, I don't even hear the voice asking me to go and meet any man.
    <br>Normally, I didn't read the Bible, I didn't even believe that there was
    <br>God in this world but now, I believe there is God.
    <br>I read my Bible and pray with the Anointing Water.
    <br>I am free; I am free indeed.
    <br>My advice to youth and viewers all over the world watching me
    <br>is that you should believe that there is God and we should have faith in God.
    <br>We should be content with what we have.
    <br>I have come here to ask the man of God for help so that I will not go back to my past again.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua said that we should present this cash gift to you
    <br>of 200,000 Naira each, which is a total of 400,000 Naira and 'The Mirror' book for each.
    <br>So these are your cash gifts of 200,000 Naira each.
    <br>Viewers, as you are watching, this is a clear evidence of what the man of God used to say
    <br>that love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>If we truly are practising Christians, and we are those who believe that Jesus Christ
    <br>is our Lord and Saviour, we also have that responsibility
    <br>to live the same life as Jesus Christ lived.
    <br>Remember, the Bible says that we should let love lead.
    <br>My thanks to Prophet T.B. Joshua and may God continue blessing him.
    <br>I will be able to start a new life.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>First of all, I want to say thank you to my beloved daddy, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This cash gift the viewers are looking at is going to change my life and that of my family.
    <br>This cash gift that you see with me has brought me a new life.
    <br>You may not understand but I understand very well because I know what I have suffered.
    <br>If I was to prostitute for this money, I know how many men
    <br>would have slept with me before I could get this amount.
    <br>I want to thank my father in the Lord for giving me this money
    <br>so that I can start a new life and live a good life like every other normal girl.
    <br>We want to encourage you now, as you have received this wonderful testimony in your lives,
    <br>make sure that you stay close to Jesus Christ.
    <br>Make Him the CEO of your life so everything you received shall remain permanent
    <br>and those blessings of God that you have received and are still going to receive
    <br>will continue to be multiplied in your lives, in Jesus' mighty name.
    <br>Amen, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
