    <br>"THIS IS MY STORY" | TB Joshua's Full DOCUMENTARY
    <br>When David was brought to the king to defend his cause,
    <br>he simply testified of how God had delivered him, saved him,
    <br>rescued him from the mouth of lion and bear, in his tender age.
    <br>Today, when we come out for the testimony, it is nothing but the immediate goodness of God.
    <br>Remember the sickness you had in the past.
    <br>The same sickness others had and died,
    <br>while many others are still on the sickbed.
    <br>Life is in stages.

    <br>there is always another level to reach for.

    <br>"THIS IS MY STORY" | TB Joshua's Full DOCUMENTARY
    <br>We shall watch a documentary on who is T.B.Joshua, and the Synagogue Church of all Nations.
    <br>A lot has been said by people concerning how the church,
    <br>'Synagogue' came into being.
    <br>Some people questioned my foundation, my mentor,
    <br>my educational background and my calling as a man of God.
    <br>I am not showing this documentary because people questioned
    <br>my foundation, my background, my mentor,
    <br>my educational background, my calling as a man of God.
    <br>I am showing it because it is God's time. That is, it is an act of God.
    <br>Stay blessed and watch.
    <br>THIS IS MY STORY
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>This is prophet T.B. Joshua at the prayer mountain.
    <br>Guided by the Holy Spirit prophet T.B. Joshua came to this prayer mountain to seek the face of God.
    <br>Like prophets of old, he fasted and prayed for forty days and forty nights,
    <br>as prayer and fasting open the door for God to enter.
    <br>It was at this very prayer mountain that prophet T.B. Joshua received divine anointing from God
    <br>to start his ministry.
    <br>As he raises his arms to heaven and then falls to pray, he receives a covenant from God
    <br>concerning his calling.
    <br>Only he and God know the divine message that was revealed to him at that moment.
    <br>Concerning this experience prophet T.B. Joshua said:
    <br>"I was in a trance for three consecutive days.
    <br>Then I saw a hand that pointed a Bible to my heart, and the Bible entered my heart,
    <br>and my heart immersed with the Bible immediately.
    <br>Then the awareness came, and I saw the apostles and prophets of old,
    <br>with Someone whose head I couldn't see
    <br>because He was tall to the Heaven and suspended, which I believe was our Lord - Jesus Christ
    <br>sitting in their midst.
    <br>I also saw myself in their midst.
    <br>After a while I saw a hand of the same tall man, I could not behold His face, which was glittering
    <br>with an unimaginable light.
    <br>But all the apostles - I could see their faces, particularly apostles Peter and Paul,
    <br>prophets Moses, Elijah, and others.
    <br>Their names were boldly written on their chests.
    <br>I heard the voice saying: "I am your God. I am giving you a divine commission
    <br>to go and carry out the work of the Heavenly Father".
    <br>At the same time, the same hand of the tall man gave me a small cross and a big Bible,
    <br>bigger than the one that had entered my heart, with the promise, that as I keep pressing in His time and name,
    <br>I would be given a bigger cross.
    <br>But if I fail, the opposite would occur.
    <br>I also heard the voice of the same tall man, that I could not see His head, saying: "I am the Lord your God,
    <br>who was, and who is - Jesus Christ giving orders to all the apostles and prophets".
    <br>The same voice said to me: "I would show you the wonderful ways, I would reveal myself through you,
    <br>in teaching, preaching, miracles, signs and wonders for the salvation of souls."
    <br>Since then I have been receiving in my visions every year, according to my faithfulness to God,
    <br>a bigger cross that means to me more responsibilities.
    <br>The Bible that entered my heart symbolized Spirit and Life - the Holy Spirit.
    <br>God's Word is Spirit and Live.
    <br>He does nothing without His Word.
    <br>The book of Romans 8:16 says God's Spirit joins Himself to our spirit
    <br>to declare that we are children of God.
    <br>This divine anointing is performed by God Himself on all who have the wonderful privilege
    <br>of becoming His children.
    <br>It accompanies the conversion of those who trust in Christ.
    <br>Paul said that the Spirit indwells every believer and His presence is the guarantee of our future glory in Heaven,
    <br>according to the Book of 2 Corinthians 1:21-22
    <br>As a result of His indwelling presence we have the ability to become more like Christ, in accordance with
    <br>2 Corinthians 3:17-18.
    <br>We who are born of God have no excuse of remaining as we are.
    <br>We can be increasingly conformed to the image of Christ by yielding ourselves to God's anointing,
    <br>the Holy Spirit who dwells in our hearts.
    <br>Father, thank You for Your Spirit. Fill us with His Love and Power,
    <br>change us into Christ's' own image,
    <br>day by day and hour by hour.
    <br>Remember, Father gave us the Spirit to make us like His Son."
    <br>These are the pictures you will bring out and show people.
    <br>By the time the glory of God is revealed to the world and other countries start coming,
    <br>at that time, I will not have the time to come here again. I will have my own prayer mountain.
    <br>The man of God said that by the time the glory of God is revealed in his ministry,
    <br>and people from other countries start coming,
    <br>he would no longer have the time to visit this prayer mountain,
    <br>and in the future he would have his own prayer mountain.
    <br>This is a picture of Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for people after just having returned from a forty days,
    <br>and forty nights fast at the prayer mountain.
    <br>During the early years of his ministry, prophet T.B. Joshua did not have a vehicle to move around.
    <br>He walked almost everywhere he went for two years.
    <br>The children surrounding prophet T.B. Joshua are among those he gathered to follow him,
    <br>as he went to form first Synagogue Church of all Nations.
    <br>"THIS IS MY STORY" | TB Joshua's Full DOCUMENTARY
    <br>This is the first site and the first structure of the Synagogue Church of all Nations,
    <br>where prophet T.B. Joshua have just returned from the prayer mountain, lays the foundation of the church
    <br>located in Agodo-Egbe, Lagos Nigeria.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua walks joyfully among the members, as he lifts their faith with the Word of God.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>In fact, I don't know where to start.
    <br>My coming into your midst is just to lay a foundation.
    <br>Today, we start the Synagogue here!
    <br>1989
    <br>1st Church
    <br>Worshippers gathered at the second church building of the Synagogue Church of all Nations,

    <br>was completely destroyed.
    <br>2nd Church
    <br>After the second church building was destroyed, another building was built;
    <br>this time using the wooden planks.
    <br>The first service was held at the new building of the Synagogue Church of all Nations in 1992.
    <br>The man you are seeing now, although difficult to recognize, is prophet T.B. Joshua at the age of 29,
    <br>ministering to the members.

    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesies to the people saying; we are in a small crusade now, but in the future
    <br>it is going to be big.
    <br>One might question why a church of just a small number of the outskirts of Lagos Nigeria
    <br>should become the Synagogue Church of all Nations
    <br>But this is the vision God had given to prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>"THIS IS MY STORY" | TB Joshua's Full DOCUMENTARY
    <br>Whatever situation you are going through, serves a purpose.
    <br>It may be to stop you a while in order to reform you.
    <br>It may be to strengthen your desire.
    <br>Remember the man at the pool of Bethesda.
    <br>It may be to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>We have seen people who had spent many years in the prison, later reaching the throne.

    <br>1 Samuel 17:37
    <br>“The Lord, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear,
    <br>will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.”
    <br>That is David.
    <br>When David was brought to the king to defend his cause,
    <br>he simply testified of how God had delivered him, saved him,
    <br>rescued him from the mouth of lion and bear, in his tender age.
    <br>Today, when we come out for a testimony, it is nothing but the immediate goodness of God.
    <br>Remember the sickness you had in the past.
    <br>The same sickness others had and died,
    <br>while many others are still on the sickbed.
    <br>Life is in stages.

    <br>to accommodate the inflows of new worshippers.
    <br>In 1994, the church moved to Ikotun-Egbe, Lagos Nigeria.

    <br>One may ask the question; "why did prophet T.B. Joshua keep such a detailed record, right from the beginning,
    <br>of the life he lived?".

    <br>It has God behind it for its accomplishment.

    <br>Life is in stages.
    <br>This record shows that there are different stages I went through in life.
    <br>Each stage served a purpose.
    <br>What are you going through as a Christian?
    <br>Tell you neighbor; "Are you a Christian?".
    <br>Whatever you are going through serves a purpose.
    <br>It may be to stop you a while in order to preserve you.
    <br>It may be to stop you a while in order to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>Tell you neighbor; "Whatever you are going through, as a Christian served a purpose".

    <br>"THIS IS MY STORY" | TB Joshua's Full DOCUMENTARY
    <br>Imagine the rumours and gossip that spread as a result of this incident.
    <br>A Prophet detained in a cell for taking drugs and harbouring weapons.
    <br>However his enemies soon notice, that not even a detention in a cell and false accusations
    <br>would shake his faith in God.
    <br>To the wise this was a foolish thing, but God used it to reveal His purpose in the life of T.B. Joshua,
    <br>giving him the necessary experience and maturity to handle the greater responsibilities
    <br>God was preparing for him.
    <br>Like Joseph in the Bible; he has learnt what it is to be loved, hated, rejected, and slaved.
    <br>Accused and falsely convicted he bore everything that happened to him calmly.
    <br>This is the letter from the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency confirming the innocence
    <br>of T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and clearing him from the charge of drug dealing, for which he was detained in a cell for 13 days.
    <br>Remember, our enemy may rob us of our liberty and confine us in a prison cell,
    <br>but they cannot shut us out of the throne of mercy and communion with God.
    <br>Falsely accused of drug dealing by the (NDLEA) National Drug Law Enforcement Agency,
    <br>T.B. Joshua was arrested and held in cell for 13 days.
    <br>This is the first appearance of T.B. Joshua, having just been released from the cell.
    <br>He addressed the congregation thanking them for their faithfulness and love,
    <br>for standing by him in the hard times, referring to their unequal effort towards his absence.
    <br>You can see the man of God T.B. Joshua looking lean, having spent 13 days in a cell.
    <br>T.B. Joshua in the (NDLEA) National Drug Enforcement Agency Cell in 1996
    <br>"THIS IS MY STORY" | TB Joshua's Full DOCUMENTARY
    <br>I am using this opportunity to thank you all for your unequal efforts towards my absence.
    <br>I am here to thank you all.
    <br>God Almighty will continue to be with you.
    <br>If you say to yourself, “Why me of all this trouble, persecution, tribulation and all sort of things",
    <br>I want you to think back and ask, “Why me of all these spiritual blessing in my life?”
    <br>When you count the blessing of God in your life, doubt will fly away.
    <br>Even if you are suffering and you lack of this and that, remember the blessing of God
    <br>like food, shelter and many others you are enjoying today.
    <br>Having searched and found nothing against him, T.B. Joshua was released from the cell,
    <br>and the following Sunday appeared in the church service to thank the members and appreciate their love
    <br>and support during his absence.
    <br>Rather than to complain and query; "why me of all this trouble and persecution?" T.B. Joshua encouraged
    <br>the congregation to remember the spiritual blessings many are denied of, such as food and shelter,
    <br>that they can hold the very Word of God in their hands, and read it,
    <br>that they have the knowledge of His saving grace.
    <br>The man of God encouraged them saying, "when you begin to count your blessings your doubts will fly away".
    <br>In the College of God, however brilliant you may be, you will not be given a double promotion.
    <br>You will take every course.
    <br>In the University of God, however brilliant you may be, you will not be given a double promotion.
    <br>You will take every course
    <br>because each course serves a purpose.
    <br>Right from the beginning, I knew that I must taste poverty in order to manage blessing.

    <br>As Colossians 3:23-24 says; whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for man,
    <br>since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.
    <br>It is a Lord Christ you are serving.

    <br>My objectives, right from the beginning, and my motives were determined at once.
    <br>I wanted what God wanted.
    <br>I wanted it for the reason God wanted it.
    <br>Those principles anchored me through my teenage years.
    <br>They guided me.
    <br>They were the fountain stone of my life.
    <br>You raise me up
    <br>So I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up

    <br>There were the fountain stone of my home, and the reason of our evangelists and pastors to be.
    <br>People of God, God has a time for everything.
