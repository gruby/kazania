  <p>    
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>THE SCOAN
    <br>Thank you. Hallelujah!
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>THE SCOAN
    <br>So, God has done it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now you need to ask yourself:
    <br>Are you really the person God wants you to be?
    <br>Ask yourself.
    <br>Am I the person God wants me to be?
    <br>That is the question we need to ask. This is what I am going to talk about today.
    <br>One can be very rich and yet not what God wants him to be.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The reward of the person of God is the genuine peace of heart
    <br>and the legacy for generations.
    <br>Legacy lives for what? - Generations.
    <br>Can you see the two things: the genuine peace of heart and the legacy to live for generations.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>One can be a prophet and yet not the person God wants him to be.
    <br>One can be a president of a nation, and yet not the person God wants him to be.
    <br>One can be the richest person in the world, yet not what God wants him to be.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Think about it.
    <br>How can somebody be the richest in the world and yet not what God wants him to be?
    <br>Because he or she lacks the genuine peace of heart
    <br>and such wealth cannot live for generations.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can be a prophet or bishop and yet not what God wants you to be.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So the question you need to ask yourself:
    <br>Are you really the person God wants you to be?
    <br>How do we know what God wants us to be?
    <br>The answer has been given.
    <br>The first step to know our destiny - what God wants you to be - is to get to know God better.
    <br>We will talk about that today.
    <br>To get to know who? - God better.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are not talking of religious conduct and behaviours.
    <br>where we are all actually coming from.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You need to know God better".
    <br>You need to get to know God better.
    <br>We Christians today claim we know God by confessing faith in the Word
    <br>and denying it in action.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say, "I know God, God is .. .I am a born again Christian".
    <br>We confess faith in the Word but deny it in action.
    <br>This is why we need to know God better - to discover yourself.
    <br>You are what God says you are but you don't know.
    <br>You can do what God says you can do but you don't know.
    <br>You have what God says you have but you don't know.
    <br>If you know you have what God says you have and you can do what God says you can do
    <br>oh my God - the sky will be your limit.
    <br>You will not compare yourself to others; you will be content.
    <br>Confessing faith in the Word but denying it in action.
    <br>Trying to believe yet never acting on the Word.
    <br>I believe Jesus is Lord. Jesus this, Jesus that.
    <br>I'm just telling you your life style.
    <br>The kind of Christian you are.
    <br>This is why I say you need to know God better.
    <br>I'm just telling you, I'm just describing the kind of person you are.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Trying to believe yet never acting on the Word; that is the kind of Christian you are -
    <br>sense-knowledge believers.
    <br>You have to see in order to believe.
    <br>"No, what are you telling me?"
    <br>You must see in order to believe.
    <br>You have to see in order to believe.
    <br>You cannot believe beyond what your senses register.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let's look at one gentleman in the Bible here.
    <br>The Book of John 20:24.
    <br>It says:
    <br>"Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
    <br>So the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord!'
    <br>But he said to them, 'Unless I see the nail marks in his hands
    <br>and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.'"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is sense-ruled Thomas - a man like us.
    <br>You have to see in order to believe; we cannot believe beyond what our senses register -
    <br>this is the kind of Christian we are.
    <br>Our daily battle is with our senses.
    <br>We fight the people we see and our weapon of warfare is not carnal.
    <br>Our armour is divine.
    <br>We fight the people we see
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Somebody curses you, you believe you want to fight. You fight your sister, your brother.
    <br>You preach against your brother.
    <br>We react  to the things we see.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Bible says that we cannot know the things that are freely given to us of the Father
    <br>until we are recreated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Book of Luke 10:20 - what does it say?
    <br>Don't rejoice because the spirit submits to you;
    <br>rejoice because your name is written in the Book of life.
    <br>Today we are pastors, prophets, evangelists just because we dream and it comes to pass.
    <br>We are pastors, evangelists, prophets just because we prophesy and it comes to pass.
    <br>We are pastors, evangelists, bishops just because we pray and things happen.
    <br>The Spirit may convict us, speak through us, operate in us
    <br>but He cannot make His home in us unless we are recreated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are a lot of pastors, bishops, prophets everywhere - just dream and it comes to pass.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Prophesying - it will rain tomorrow and suddenly it rains.
    <br>Ah! You people will come together to build a church for him
    <br>because the prophecy has come to pass.
    <br>That is your assessment today.
    <br>So many of us here become a Christian today because you speak, the results come.
    <br>You dream and you say your dream and it comes to pass.
    <br>Oh, that makes you a Christian.
    <br>What is the way out? That is the question for you and I.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Because you already have to agree with me that you are a sense-knowledge believer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You are a sense-knowledge believer".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[You are a sense-knowledge believer.]
    <br>To know God better is to know your calling and it's to know your spiritual gifts.
    <br>What is the way out?
    <br>The principal source of finding ourselves recreated is the Bible - there is no substitute for it.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>The principal source of finding ourselves recreated is the Bible - there is no substitute for it.
    <br>If there is no substitute for it, how do we get the Bible into our hearts - the Word of God?
    <br>Don't forget - the Bible is given by the inspiration of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can read the Bible a hundred times, million times;
    <br>as long as you hold grudges, unforgiveness,
    <br>as long as you harbour bitterness, envy, jealous, hatred, it makes no meaning.
    <br>The Bible is given by inspiration of God. Holy men were carried along by the Spirit.
    <br>You can read the Bible a hundred thousand times; as long as you hold grudges,
    <br>as long as you harbour unforgiveness, bitterness, envy, jealousy, hatred, it makes no meaning.
    <br>It is as if you are reading history. Reading history is reading about events.
    <br>That is where your problem comes from.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is where my problem comes from".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[This is where my problem comes from.]
    <br>Face your neighbour, say, "This is our problem".
    <br>This is just....
    <br>This is your problem.
    <br>You take the Bible when you are not happy, when you are very upset, when you are hurt,
    <br>when you're facing challenges, situations - your are disturbed.
    <br>No! You need a free spirit to read the Bible.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Trust and Obey
    <br>For there is no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>But to trust and obey
    <br>That is just your problem.
    <br>You don't have any other problem.
    <br>To get the Word of God, you cannot get it.
    <br>You have plenty Bibles on your shelf, your library but they are not in your heart
    <br>There are here - sense.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In order to read your Bible effectively,  I suggest reading the Bible aloud,
    <br>particularly the New Testament.
    <br>Say the Scripture to yourself. Say the Word to yourself.
    <br>Insert your own name where the message is personal.
    <br>Because I want you to be spiritual.
    <br>We are only made spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.
    <br>So, I don't know how you walk with the Lord.
    <br>The Bible says possessing a spiritual gift is an important part of our walking with the Lord.
    <br>Because you can't walk with the Lord. How can you walk with Spirit, when you are not spirit?
    <br>How can you walk?
    <br>God is Spirit and His worshippers must worship Him in Spirit and truth.
    <br>Look, this is the Spirit  and I'm here with body.
    <br>Is it possible for me to walk with the Spirit?
    <br>It is not possible; you have to be spiritual.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Possessing a spiritual gift is an important part of our walking with the Lord.
    <br>You have to be spiritual to walk with the Lord.
    <br>You have to be spiritual.
    <br>You can be a prophet, pastor, bishop and yet not be what God wants you to be.
    <br>Message title:
    <br>WHAT GOD WANTS US TO BE
    <br>You can be a president of a country yet not...
    <br>I told you the reward of being the person of God -
    <br>the genuine peace of heart, the legacy to live for generations.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If today is your last day on earth, what do you think can live in you for generations?
    <br>What we have now is through controversy, fight, disagreement, "No this one is mine",
    <br>debt in the bank - we are rich but so much debt.
    <br>Everything we have - enveloped by controversies.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So please, think about that. It's very very important.
    <br>Your calling and your spiritual gift are one.
    <br>If you say, "What is my calling?", you are saying, "What is my spiritual gift?" - that is what you are asking.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>What message are you taking home today?
    <br>Am I really the person God wants me to be?
    <br>It's very important to discover yourself. What I'm talking about is our destiny.
    <br>If I am not operating on my destiny, if I'm not given the spiritual gift to operate,
    <br>what I have been going through in the past is enough to send me packing.
    <br>Look at the Apostles in the Bible; I look at the trial and temptation they went through
    <br>and I now begin to compare myself too.
    <br>I see that, "Ah, history will tell about my trial and persecution".
    <br>The most persecuted pastor; not only that, there is nothing I have not gone through in this country.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is need for you to know your calling.
    <br>If you don't know your calling and you are operating, whatever you become,
    <br>it does not take these people a second to bring you down.
    <br>Your calling is your gift, spiritual gift.
    <br>The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Right now, let us submit to the Spirit of God and welcome Him in your heart.
    <br>Welcome Him.
    <br>Father, we thank You!
    <br>I release you from the pain of the past!
    <br>Be released from the pain of the past!
    <br>Pain of the past is the cause of unforgiveness, bitterness, envy, jealousy, hatred.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Anything that does not glorify God, forget about it; put it behind you.
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Say to yourself, "I am released".
    <br>Believe that.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I am released!]
    <br>Whatever satan might have used -
    <br>satan can use unforgiveness to connect you to himself.
    <br>This is weapon.
    <br>They are weapons of satan - unforgiveness, bitterness, envy, jealousy, hatred.
    <br>These are the weapons satan uses; this is why I say, don't hold offence.
    <br>Satan uses offence to connect us to himself.
    <br>You say, "Ah, how can satan connect me?" - Yes, through unforgiveness.
    <br>You say, "I will not forgive. What this man has done to me is too bad. He cheated me".
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you are not supposed to hold offence.
    <br>That offence, satan uses that to connect us.
    <br>That offence is a chain of satan.
    <br>You have to. Right now, work on that. Work on your life.
    <br>That is when I say, whatever satan might have used -
    <br>what are the things satan uses?
    <br>Unforgiveness, hatred, envy, jealousy, pain of the past.
    <br>He uses those things to connect us to himself.
    <br>I can see them being broken!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I can read my Bible and understand it now".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[I can read my Bible and understand it now.]
    <br>With unforgiveness, it makes no meaning.
    <br>It is as if you are reading History, Literature, Chemistry books.
    <br>This is just it - offence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Listen to me: I'm not praying for you, I'm just telling you what is happening right now.
    <br>I can see them being broken!
    <br>The chains have been broken!
    <br>Agree! Rejoice over that!
    <br>Confess this, confess your freedom now.
    <br>Chains have been broken!
    <br>Chain of affliction has been broken!
    <br>Chain of setback has been broken!
    <br>Chain of isolation has been broken!
    <br>Chain of career failure has been broken!
    <br>Open your lips and confess this - freedom!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The question now: Who is my enemy?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>Unforgiveness, envy - these are your enemies.
    <br>Bitterness, hatred, jealousy, pain towards others - these are your enemies.
    <br>If you have nightmare, you wake up, ask yourself, "I harbour unforgiveness; that is why this nightmare.
    <br>I harbour pain, hatred, envy; that brother, I have not yet forgiven that brother.
    <br>That is why I am having nightmare.
    <br>Because this is the chain, this is the connection to satan.
    <br>Satan has no route to get you but he uses the route of unforgiveness, envy, jealousy.
    <br>Please, talk to yourself.
    <br>Thank you very much.
