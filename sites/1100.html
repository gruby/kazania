    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>- Hallelujah.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Happy birthday.
    <br>Thank you. While you are sitting down, 
    <br>you can say to the Lord,
    <br>“Lord Jesus, You are the Author of my faith. 
    <br>Today, I need my faith to act.
    <br>Help my words and my thoughts”.
    <br>Bow down your heads, "I need my faith".
    <br>He is the Author of your faith.
    <br>You need your faith right now to act.
    <br>Help me – help my words and my thoughts.
    <br>You are the Author of my faith.
    <br>Lord Jesus, I need my faith now to act.
    <br>Help my words and my thoughts,
    <br> in Jesus Christ’s name.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>- Hallelujah. 
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>Let’s take a look at the Book of Colossians, the Book of John, the Book of Acts and the Book of Ephesians.
    <br>We will take our first reading from the
    <br> Book of Colossians 3, verse 16.
    <br>“Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly…”
    <br>That is abundantly.
    <br>That is our proof text, but read
    <br> from the beginning of that Book.
    <br>“Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, 
    <br>set your hearts on things above..."
    <br>Like I have told you, "Set your heart on things above".
    <br>"... where Christ is, seated at the right hand
    <br> of God.” - Colossians 3:1
    <br>Take a look at the verse 16,
    <br>“Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly 
    <br>as you teach and admonish one another
    <br>with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, 
    <br>and songs from the Spirit…” - Colossians 3:16
    <br>- Hallelujah.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>The Book of Ephesians 3:17.
    <br>“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith…”
    <br>It means through faith, Christ can dwell in your heart.
    <br>Christ dwells in my heart through faith.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Take your reading from the beginning.
    <br>I’m giving you the proof text.
    <br>Let's go to the Book of John 15, verse 7.
    <br>“If you remain in me and my words remain in you,
    <br>ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.”
    <br>When you take your time to read that
    <br> Book of Ephesians 3:17, and Colossians 3:16,
    <br>and the Book of Acts 20:32, you will agree 
    <br>with me that Christ and the Word are One.
    <br>Jesus Christ and the Word are One.
    <br>The Book of John 15:7 says,
    <br>“If you dwell in Me and My Word dwells in
    <br> you, ask whatsoever and it shall be done”.
    <br>If Christ dwells in you and His
    <br> Word dwells in you; can you see?
    <br>Christ and the Word are One.
    <br>In Ephesians you will find the same; it says that
    <br>Christ can only live in you through faith, 
    <br>live in your heart through faith.
    <br>Our heart is of faith.
    <br>Man’s heart is of faith, not man’s mind.
    <br>When you say "Heart", you mean your Spirit - Biblical.
    <br>In this way, it  is the Word dominating us 
    <br>that produces prayer fruits – that is, result.
    <br>You say, "In the name of Jesus..." - what are you saying?
    <br>Are you saying this with all your heart?
    <br>Because saying, "In the name of Jesus..."...
    <br>We know Christ through His Word.
    <br>We know Him through the Word.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus. In the blood of Jesus. In the name of Jesus...";
    <br>what are you saying?
    <br>Are you with all your heart, you mean it?
    <br>It is the Word dominating us that 
    <br>produces the prayer fruit, result -
    <br>not the Word committed to memory
    <br> which is of course valuable in itself
    <br>but cannot produce prayer fruits.
    <br>But cannot do what?
    <br>It cannot produce prayer fruits.
    <br>How can the Word dwell in our hearts?
    <br>The Word dwells in our hearts when 
    <br>we read it slowly, attentively and repeatedly
    <br>without holding grudges.
    <br>You say, "How will I read... ?"
    <br>If I hold grudges towards any 
    <br>of my neighbors anywhere,
    <br>I should not be surprised that the Word is no longer real to me while talking, preaching, reading.
    <br>If the Word is no longer real to me, "In the name of Jesus" - I'm talking to myself; it is no real.
    <br>"Be healed!" - I'm talking of myself,
    <br> because it is no longer real.
    <br>So, in the same way you do.
    <br>If I hold grudges, I should not be surprised
    <br> to see that the Word is no longer real to me
    <br>when reading, preaching, talking, praying.
    <br>Can you see the challenges we are facing?
    <br>Committing the Word to memory is of course
    <br> valuable in itself but cannot produce prayer fruits;
    <br>they cannot produce result.
    <br>We know Christ through the Word.
    <br>Through the Word, we know Jesus Christ.
    <br>It is the Word that has taught 
    <br>us the value of the name, Jesus,
    <br>the authority of the name and
    <br> our legal right to the use of the name.
    <br>It is the Word - the Word of God.
    <br>Our legal right to the use of the name.
    <br>Nobody will challenge you when you say, 
    <br>"In the name of Jesus" - nobody will accuse you,
    <br>but the legal right to use the name by the 
    <br>power of Holy Ghost - it is the Word that taught us.
    <br>How can the Word dwell in us?
    <br>The Word dwells in us when we read it 
    <br>slowly, attentively and repeatedly
    <br>without holding grudges.
    <br>How many of us here are free 
    <br>from grudges, pain of the past?
    <br>“Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.”
    <br>That is what the Bible is saying.
    <br>When you read the Bible, you hear from God.
    <br>“Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us.”
    <br>Whether wrongly or rightly; in whatever way.
    <br>And you are carrying the Bible to read.
    <br>The Word dominating us is the Lordship of Christ in us.
    <br>A good example: “Be healed, in the name of Jesus!”
    <br>“In the name of Jesus, be delivered!”
    <br>“In the name of Jesus, be set free!”
    <br>It is the Word dominating us that
    <br> brings Jesus to the scene
    <br>and instantly, healing takes place.
    <br>It is the Word dwelling in us that
    <br> brings Jesus to the scene.
    <br>"Jesus!", and He will come.
    <br>It is the Word dominating us, dwelling in us, 
    <br>living in us that brings Jesus to the scene.
    <br>Now, you know where your challenges come from.
    <br>Though, you have the Bible, the name 
    <br>"Jesus" you know how to call,
    <br>but it seems that name is not giving the result.
    <br>Listen, we know Jesus Christ through the Word.
    <br>Without the Word is without Jesus Christ.
    <br>Has the Word ruled us?
    <br>Jesus is building Himself into us 
    <br>and making Himself a part of us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Is the Word dominating us?”
    <br>I mean, is the Word dwelling in us?
    <br>Is the Word living in us?
    <br>Is the Word ruling us?
    <br>Jesus is building Himself in us and 
    <br>making Himself a part of us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The more you meditate, the more 
    <br>your spirit acts upon the Word
    <br>and the more the Word becomes part of you.
    <br>The more you meditate on what you read in the Bible, 
    <br>the more your spirit acts upon the Word,
    <br>or you say the more your heart - it is the 
    <br>same as your spirit acts upon the Word,
    <br>and the more the Word becomes part of you.
    <br>When the Word becomes part of you, 
    <br>you can make use of it.
    <br>Then, you can say, “In the name of Jesus, be free!”
    <br>And if there is freedom, it means 
    <br>that the Word has become part of you.
    <br>When the Word becomes part of you,
    <br> you can say, “Jesus!”
    <br>When you sleep and there is a nightmare or an attack in the dream, some people come to attack you,
    <br>you say, "Jesus!" and you see them bow,
    <br>instead of when you see people in the dream,
    <br> coming to attack you, you say, "Honey, honey..."
    <br>How can honey become Jesus?
    <br>"Honey, honey...", it will not say,
    <br> "What is happening, my dear?"
    <br>Is that not what has happened to you?
    <br>People come with gun to attack you, 
    <br>you say, "... Honey, honey..."
    <br>Honey will not say, "My dear,
    <br> what happened, in Jesus name?"
    <br>And they have attacked you already
    <br> before you called that name.
    <br>They have attacked you because the 
    <br>Word has not become part of you.
    <br>Has the Word dominated us?
    <br>Is the Word living in us?
    <br>Jesus is building Himself in us, 
    <br>making Himself a part of us.
    <br>The Word has not yet dominated you.
    <br>It has not yet dwelt in you.
    <br>You can have the knowledge of the Bible -
    <br>you read, memorize and use it to preach, teach, lecture
    <br>but living by it, it must dwell in you.
    <br>Don't forget those passages and Books given to you.
    <br>Take your time to read the
    <br> Book of Ephesians 3, from verse 17,
    <br>the Book of John 15; take reading from verse 7,
    <br>the Book of Acts 20; take reading from verse 32,
    <br>the Book of Colossians 3;
    <br> take your reading from verse 16.
    <br>You cannot build one up spiritually.
    <br>Because, today this is what is happening
    <br> all over today, everywhere.
    <br>Church has become an entertainment.
    <br>We cannot build people up spiritually
    <br> on the theory about the Book,
    <br>on the history or philosophy.
    <br>"Jesus is this. The mother is here. The father is this. 
    <br>The Son is this. He was born in the manger..."
    <br>You cannot be built up spiritually on the history of the Book, the theory about the Book
    <br>or philosophy of the Book.
    <br>The Word must dominate, live in us.
    <br>Building can only come from the heart;
    <br> it is what comes from our heart that can build.
    <br>Don't forget at the beginning I said,
    <br>if I hold grudges, I should not be surprised 
    <br>to see that the Bible is no longer real to me
    <br>when talking, reading, preaching.
    <br>See what is going on in churches today; 
    <br>there is so much division - that is grudges.
    <br>This is why the Bible is no longer real to us,
    <br> because of so much division.
    <br>"This one is not good. That one is not good."
    <br> - fight everywhere in the churches.
    <br>The churches are no longer one.
    <br>This is why the Bible is no longer real to us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are no longer one.
    <br>Fight.
    <br>Many of us are here today without the permission, because if you tried to collect permission,
    <br>they would not allow you to come.
    <br>Many are sitting at the back; each
    <br> time the camera is coming they dodge,
    <br>because they don't want their mentor to see them.
    <br>Each time the camera comes...
    <br>Some even put on very dark shade.
    <br>Each time camera comes they bow.
    <br>Instead of bowing to Jesus they bow to camera.
    <br>When it is mass prayer, instead of facing
    <br> on front, they turn back, "In Jesus name";
    <br>as if Holy Spirit is the one turning them.
    <br>... because you cannot bear the 
    <br>consequence, after leaving here.
    <br>They will chase you out of your business, 
    <br>your house - because they are your bread.
    <br>This is why the Bible is no longer real to us, 
    <br>because there is division.
    <br>I want to leave you here.
    <br>I don't want you to have too much to think about.
    <br>I want you to have so much to meditate 
    <br>about, not to think about.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you...
