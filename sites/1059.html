  <p>    
    <br>Madam, there is a spirit that is disturbing you.
    <br>Yes, Prophet.
    <br>You cannot just explain. When you are going, you would be hearing the voice.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You don't know who is talking.
    <br>Sometimes, the voice seems to control you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You know Jesus loves you.
    <br>Yes, I do.
    <br>My name is Patricia. I'm from the USA.
    <br>The prophecy you gave is very true.
    <br>After I got married six to seven months ago, I started having evil thoughts to injure
    <br>my husband - to kick, stab and cut him.
    <br>Even while I am lying in bed, talking with him, I would have these evil thoughts.
    <br>Only by His grace, I was able to resist but they kept persisting.
    <br>And when that stopped, other things started happening in our relationship.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You are free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Patricia. I'm from the United States.
    <br>This is my lovely husband, Christopher.
    <br>The reason that originally brought me to The SCOAN back in May 2016 was for breakthrough.
    <br>However, prior to my coming here, I had recently gotten married.
    <br>About two to three months after I got married,
    <br>I began to have thoughts and hear voices.
    <br>Those thoughts and voices were telling me - just as Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied -
    <br>to hurt, injure my husband.
    <br>At the time, when they were happening, I didn't know where it was coming from
    <br>because prior to us being married, I didn't have that problem.
    <br>There was no problem. There was affection and love between my husband and I.
    <br>After we became married, that was when these thoughts began to happen.
    <br>At that time, I couldn't really telll anyone what was going on
    <br>because it was embarrasing, and I felt ashamed.
    <br>I couldn't even tell him. I didn't even tell him.
    <br>It was not until recently. He is just hearing this - what happened.
    <br>So, I got to The SCOAN, and I came for breakthrough.
    <br>I didn't come for that. I came for breakthrough.
    <br>And Prophet T.B. Joshua called me out from the crowd and prophesied to me.
    <br>I have to say that it is 100% true.
    <br>What he said is 100% true.
    <br>He prayed for me.
    <br>I fell as you can see.
    <br>Even when I fell, I didn't even know what happened.
    <br>When I got back, I asked my family, "Did somebody pull me?
    <br>Did someone pull me down because I just found myself on the floor?"
    <br>And they said, "No". They were watching.
    <br>After the prayer, I went back home.
    <br>The thoughts and voices all left.
    <br>There was none of that ever again.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Not only has that disappeared and gone, my husband and I are even closer now than we were before.
    <br>It is like we are a unit now; we are fused.
    <br>And I just thank God; I give God all the glory for this.
    <br>I have to tell you that when you are experiencing something like that,
    <br>it is embarrassing; it is shameful.
    <br>I couldn't tell anyone. It was only right before I came here in 2016,
    <br>that I mentioned it to my mum and my aunt.
    <br>They were shocked.
    <br>They were afraid that this thing was happening to me.
    <br>I didn't tell anything but I thank God that I did
    <br>because they were watching that day when Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied to me.
    <br>And they knew what he said was true, was happening in my life.
    <br>Can you imagine being married to someone you love - I love my husband,
    <br>I love him.
    <br>Everytime when this thing was happening, he would be asleep.
    <br>I would be sitting on the bed and the thought would come,
    <br>and I would look at him and cry.
    <br>I would feel remorse because how can you just being married to someone
    <br>and then you begin to abuse, hate and stab them.
    <br>It was very shameful.
    <br>But I realised that it was the enemy - he wanted to harrass me.
    <br>He wanted me to cry and feel remorse.
    <br>Only by God's grace was I delivered.
    <br>I was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>My aunt, out of nowhere, came to me about Emmanuel TV three times.
    <br>On the third time I said, "Ok, let me just stop what I'm doing; I'm going to watch it".
    <br>As I began to watch, that is what helped and sustained me from abusing my husband.
    <br>I never - thank God, by God's grace - acted on those thoughts.
    <br>I believe it was only because I was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was praying with the prophet and touching the screen.
    <br>And let me tell you, in the United States, there are people that suffer from this all the time.
    <br>They are arrested. When they are apprehended and interviewed,
    <br>they are asked, "Why did you do this? Why?"
    <br>Some of them will say, "Well, I heard a voice telling me to stab this person
    <br>or run these people over with a car
    <br>or I had this thought, I heard a voice".
    <br>I had a thought and at first when I heard it, I thought,
    <br>"Is this me? Why would I want to do this?"
    <br>It wasn't me.
    <br>I realised that it was not me; it was satan - the adversary, the enemy of my soul -
    <br>wanting me to abuse my husband to disgrace me and disgrace my husband.
    <br>So I'm telling you, wherever you are,
    <br>if you know someone that is having this problem or you are having this problem,
    <br>please, reach out to God.
    <br>Emmanuel TV was the way I could reach out to God.
    <br>Reach out to God and He will deliver you.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for the wonderful deliverance that our sister received.
    <br>As she said, there are many people around the world,
    <br>who are under the influence, the bondage of such spirits that push them to commit evil acts.
    <br>As she said, many people, by the time they are interviewed by the police,
    <br>they will say that they heard a voice, something pushed or propelled them,
    <br>and by that time, it is already too late - they have committed the crime.
    <br>But today, our sister is delivered and she is advising all
    <br>that if you are having such an issue, you too should seek deliverance in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>So once again, sister, ever since you returned from The SCOAN back to America,
    <br>the voice stopped, that thought disappeared. And how else has your life and finances changed,
    <br>ever since you encountered Jesus here?
    <br>I thank the Lord. No more problems with the voices; no oppression.
    <br>My husband and I are even closer than we were before.
    <br>We have actually received financial breakthrough, increase in our finances
    <br>and more income. My job is more secure now and I thank God.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty! Right now, we would like to hear a quick word from your husband.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chris. I'm from the state of New Jersey in the USA.
    <br>This is Patricia, my beautiful wife.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN for the first time.
    <br>That was one day that I didn't watch Emmanuel TV; I wanted it for her to be personal.
    <br>When she came home, I picked her up from the airport.
    <br>She told me that the man of God came right to her and gave her a prophecy.
    <br>He then touched her on the head and she fell.
    <br>I said, "Oh, let's watch Emmanuel TV".
    <br>She didn't say anything and then I left her alone.
    <br>Even before then, when we started watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>I didn't know anything about the voices but we were doing well.
    <br>When she came back from The SCOAN, it got better.
    <br>Finances - we no longer had the strain on our finances.
    <br>We were better than we were before; we were closer.
    <br>Just after her first visit to The SCOAN, everything got better between us -
    <br>finances and personal relationship-wise.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sir, now you yourself have come to experience the presence of God here in The SCOAN.
    <br>Just tell us, how has your coming here really uplifted your faith
    <br>and blessed you in a special way?
    <br>Well, I am Catholic.
    <br>So when we started watching Emmanuel TV,  there was a little bit of guarded feeling.
    <br>Not scepticism but just guarded.
    <br>Americans are cynical and sceptical in nature.
    <br>So last Sunday, the Easter service, was the first time
    <br>that I experienced The SCOAN personally for myself.
    <br>I was believing more as I was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>But seeing everything in person for the first time last Sunday at Easter service
    <br>was eye-opening for me; it allowed the faith of God to just shower over me and believe...
    <br>...just to believe in the man of God and believe that when I see deliverance and healing,
    <br>and hear him give prophecy, it just allows me to let go off whatever cynicism I had
    <br>and let faith just wash over me and believe it.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God. And, sir, in the light of this, what is your advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>My advice is to do what you can to experience The SCOAN.
    <br>If you can only watch Emmanuel TV and pray with Prophet T.B. Joshua, do that.
    <br>But, especially in America, if you feel like you want to come here, come here.
    <br>Nigeria is a beautiful country so I hope Americans do not believe anything
    <br>and the area for The SCOAN is completely safe, secure, beautiful.
    <br>We've enjoyed the joy and the peace and restful sleep you don't get anywhere else.
    <br>And it has to be because of Prophet T.B. Joshua and God.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>When you are watching Emmanuel TV, pay attention to the message
    <br>because for people who live in the United States,
    <br>things like this are a little bit rare - deliverance and the type of message -
    <br>the deep message that we get is a little rare.
    <br>Pay attention to the message.
    <br>Pray with Prophet T.B. Joshua - put your hand on the screen and believe.
    <br>Use your faith to believe.
    <br>The second part is: As my husband said, if you can come here and experience it,
    <br>come and experience it.
    <br>And if things are a little tough for you to make it, believe that God will make a way.
    <br>Because like my husband said, in the beginning, our finances were strained.
    <br>But I wanted to come here; I really wanted to come here.
    <br>And I just kept saying, "God, take more of me, give me more of You.
    <br>More of Your prosperity, healing, deliverance.
    <br>Oh, Father, make a way for me".
    <br>Within two months, He made a way!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ! We give all the glory to Jesus!
    <br>And we pray that God will give the two of you the grace to continue
    <br>to make the Word of God the standard for your lives
    <br>and we know the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
