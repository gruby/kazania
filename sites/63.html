    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Here is wise man Daniel at The SCOAN praying for the people in Jesus' name and restoring them back
    <br>to the original position, in which God Almighty had created them.
    <br>This man reacts violently, as light meets darkness through the touch of wise man Daniel.
    <br>Let's see how he was delivered in Jesus' name.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Who are you? Speak!
    <br>I am the tiger.
    <br>What do you mean by saying you are a tiger?
    <br>I just need little.
    <br>If he can obey – no problem.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>I have destroyed him.
    <br>He is nothing.
    <br>All he studied – nothing.
    <br>I wanted him to work and serve me with his money.
    <br>He said God called him.
    <br>Who is God?
    <br>Who is God that called him?
    <br>He then left me and served God.
    <br>I allowed him to flow and then after some time, I stepped in.
    <br>I destroyed all.
    <br>I laid accusations of so many things.
    <br>He is finished.
    <br>This one – he studied in Poland, in Marine Mechanical Engineering.
    <br>He worked in a shipping company here in this country.
    <br>He was a manager.
    <br>He resigned. Who asked him to resign?
    <br>I want him to work and use the money to serve me because I own him.
    <br>What have you done to his marriage and to his family?
    <br>Marriage? 
    <br>I will destroy.
    <br>He can never have peace in marriage.
    <br>No friends.
    <br>He cannot have peace because he decided to serve a God that I don't know.
    <br>I want him to serve me.
    <br>I am a great lion.
    <br>I am the tiger...
    <br>Living where?
    <br>... from the deep sea of India.
    <br>Right form the day he was born in France, I came into the hospital and I owned him.
    <br>I followed him step to step.
    <br>I breastfed him and gave him everything.
    <br>How come, at the time to pay me, he turned to a God that I don’t know?
    <br>I allowed him.
    <br>Now -  nothing.
    <br>He doesn't even have a house.
    <br>He stays in that church.
    <br>He is a pastor.
    <br>Let him pastor.
    <br>He will pastor and eat the dust unless he accepts to come back to me and serve me.
    <br>He must serve me.
    <br>What have you done to his ministry, as a pastor?
    <br>Ministry?
    <br>I swept everything, put in a container and sent it to the ocean.
    <br>Where in the ocean?
    <br>Right where I come from.
    <br>Everything about him, I parcelled it and sent it to the ocean, the deep ocean of India where I come from.
    <br>That is where he belongs; that is where his blessing is.
    <br>I am the god that gave him life.
    <br>Right from birth, I breastfed him.
    <br>I gave him everything, sent him to school and did everything for him.
    <br>Ask him.
    <br>He has a first degree in Marine Mechanical Engineering.
    <br>He is the best.
    <br>Ask him.
    <br>But nothing.
    <br>He can't go anywhere.
    <br>He is a pastor; he did well.
    <br>He has all the qualifications but cannot go anywhere unless he comes back to serve me.
    <br>How did you sweep everything about his ministry and parcel it to the ocean?
    <br>I allowed him to grow.
    <br>He was reigning.
    <br>When the time came, I caused problems in the church.
    <br>I laid allegations; all were false.
    <br>I made people to hate him without any cause.
    <br>What has happened to him ministry now?
    <br>Ministry?
    <br>There is no ministry.
    <br>You can go there and see.
    <br>Everything he has put there is just there.
    <br>Just him and the things he put there.
    <br>I called him.
    <br>He should come and serve me, not this God.
    <br>You said that when he was born, you possessed him right from the hospital.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How did you go about it?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The nurse.
    <br>I came through the nurse.
    <br>The nurse was my agent.
    <br>I spat into his mouth and I possessed him.
    <br>Everybody loved him because I transferred myself.
    <br>Yes, that was like this.
    <br>He’s going to be a rich and successful man if only he decides to come back to me.
    <br>I own everything.
    <br>I will give him; he doesn't need to struggle.
    <br>He’s struggling, going left and right.
    <br>What have you done to his marriage?
    <br>Marriage.
    <br>No marriage.
    <br>Where is the marriage?
    <br>No marriage.
    <br>I spoiled everything.
    <br>How did you spoil his marriage?
    <br>Life is zero.
    <br>Life about marriage is zero.
    <br>What do you mean by that?
    <br>Do you know what is zero?
    <br>What?
    <br>When something is zero, it means it’s nothing.
    <br>It has no meaning.
    <br>You know, he belongs to me.
    <br>He doesn't belong to any woman.
    <br>I am the only person that owns him.
    <br>He will marry me, he will serve me and I will give him everything.
    <br>Madam, how are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>Who is he to you?
    <br>He's my husband.
    <br>Husband?
    <br>She said you are her husband.
    <br>No.
    <br>What do you meant by, 'no'?
    <br>No.
    <br>I said anything about marriage is zero.
    <br>He has to marry me.
    <br>I am the only person he will marry and succeed.
    <br>Who is he to you?
    <br>He's my husband.
    <br>You mean that you came with him?
    <br>Yes, we came together.
    <br>She said she came with you.
    <br>I came here alone.
    <br>Since 4pm, I was here.
    <br>You know, I supervise the whole place.
    <br>I wanted to hide myself.
    <br>I just wanted to see if actually there is power here as they said.
    <br>I came alone.
    <br>So, you came to survey if actually there is power here?
    <br>I came to see if actually there is power.
    <br>Yes, that is what I came to see.
    <br>What did you now observe?
    <br>Because this one has tried deliverance, to get out of my hand, but still no way.
    <br>Wherever he goes, I just go there; I sit down and cross my legs.
    <br>I also came here to try to see if he can be delivered.
    <br>Let me see the power that is here.
    <br>So, I followed him.
    <br>I was here monitoring him.
    <br>What is happening to you now?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>You asked me to speak and I spoke.
    <br>What do you have to say about what your husband is saying?
    <br>He always tells me that he dreams of a fat woman who says her name is tiger.
    <br>Everytime we fight, he says it’s me who has the problem and I need deliverance.
    <br>He always says that you are the one that needs deliverance?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>He says that you are the cause of the problem in the house?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What are you seeing now?
    <br>I see that it's him.
    <br>It's him that needs what?
    <br>Who was causing all the problems.
    <br>Don't worry. He will be delivered.
    <br>Right now, it is time you allow peace to reign in this temple.
    <br>It is time to quit the covenant.
    <br>Can you deliver him?
    <br>Do you know where you are?
    <br>You can't deliver this one.
    <br>This one from birth...
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>Do you know where you are?
    <br>Here?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Where is this place?
    <br>I told you that I came to see if actually there is power.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>All over your body, fire!
    <br>Out, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Your back on the floor!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You are delivered. Rise up.
    <br>DEMON POSSESSED By A TIGER!!!
    <br>What happened to you, sir?
    <br>Come, sir.
    <br>DEMON POSSESSED By A TIGER!!!
    <br>How are you, sir?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>Why were you sitting there?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>I think I stood there.
    <br>How did you find yourself on the floor?
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>I just saw myself on the floor there.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Do you remember what you just said now?
    <br>No.
    <br>Can I remind you?
    <br>OK.
    <br>You said you were the tiger.
    <br>My name is Pastor Ernest.
    <br>I am not a tiger.
    <br>You are not a tiger?
    <br>You also said that you are a lion.
    <br>Lion? I don't have a beast's face; I am a human being.
    <br>You don't have a beast's face?
    <br>You said you reside in the Red Sea in the Indian Ocean.
    <br>Indian Ocean?
    <br>How can a man be living in the Indian Ocean? No.
    <br>You said that is where you live.
    <br>No, I'm living in Lagos here.
    <br>You said as a marine engineer, you have parcelled his career and sent it to the Indian Ocean.
    <br>Oh God!
    <br>I have suffered!
    <br>God!
    <br>I have suffered!
    <br>I finished my school...
    <br>Stand up, sir.
    <br>Stand up and explain yourself.
    <br>Oh God.
    <br>You finished what?
    <br>I passed out of school 15 years ago and came to Lagos.
    <br>I worked with Niger Dock...
    <br>As what?
    <br>... as an engineer and I was sent to Poland to study.
    <br>As soon as I came back, within two months, I was promoted to a manager.
    <br>I heard a voice saying, "Resign and serve me."
    <br>You heard a voice saying?
    <br>"Resign and serve me."
    <br>I left my job.
    <br>My colleagues were laughing but I said that it was God who called me.
    <br>I started suffering.
    <br>I started ministering after going to school.
    <br>Ministering as what?
    <br>I started a church.
    <br>But, right now, you said that you are the one that made him to resign as a lion and tiger from the Red Sea,
    <br>so that he can serve you.
    <br>Me? How can I make myself resign?
    <br>You said if just now.
    <br>Hell no.
    <br>I can't make myself to resign.
    <br>My course mates, where they are now, I can't compare myself with them.
    <br>My qualifications are even better than some of them but I can't compare myself with where they are today.
    <br>Even though I travelled to many countries, I can't compare myself with them.
    <br>Where they are today?
    <br>Some of them even give me money.
    <br>I have been in France, South Africa and Poland.
    <br>So, you are not doing anything with your certificate?
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>You also said that this woman is not your wife and you came alone.
    <br>No!
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>You said you came alone.
    <br>No, we came together.
    <br>We both came here.
    <br>She also said that you always accused her of being the cause of the problems in the house.
    <br>Even before we came here this morning, there was a problem that nearly made me to leave her in the house.
    <br>The whole thing started since yesterday.
    <br>Sometimes, I just get provoked.
    <br>What were you accusing her of?
    <br>Just a minor issue.
    <br>OK, who is she to you now?
    <br>She's my wife.
    <br>You heard it all.
    <br>So, the confession you heard initially was not from your husband.
    <br>The Lord has delivered you and you are free.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>My husband is delivered.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I am delivered!
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>After his deliverance at The SCOAN, Pastor Ernest Ekah has taken the Emmanuel TV team
    <br>to the site of his church, which the evil spirit said he had completely destroyed.
    <br>DEMON POSSESSED By A TIGER!!!
    <br>Arriving at their destination the team disembarks from their vehicle.
    <br>They have arrived at the site of Pastor Ernest's ministry in Lagos.
    <br>A banner outside explains the various activities of the ministry and it's weekly services.
    <br>The inside of the church reveals a small hall with roughly 50 chairs inside.
    <br>There is a small pulpit on the front with the church logo.
    <br>Let's listen to Pastor Ernest explain the extent to which the evil spirit has destroyed his life and ministry.
    <br>My name is Rev. Ernest Davis Ekah.
    <br>The woman beside me here is my wife, Mrs Sibongile Davis Ekah.
    <br>I am the General Overseer of this ministry, Salvation Covenant Gospel Church.
    <br>I am here to explain how the evil spirit had really destroyed my life and career.
    <br>Presently, we have been asked to go from this place.
    <br>They took us to court who gave an order for us to leave at the end of last month.
    <br>There was a lawyer that was helping me but because I didn't have money to give him,
    <br>he didn't follow the cause up properly.
    <br>During that period, I called and begged him to do whatever he could for the landlord to help me
    <br>because I had nowhere to keep all these items.
    <br>Even myself, I didn't know where I would go if I had left here.
    <br>The lawyer told me he would tell them to give me 14 days because I could not afford the money.
    <br>I didn’t even have money to eat, talk less of paying for this place.
    <br>Because of that, they took us to court and it was ruled that we should move out.
    <br>I had been going from one pastor to another trying to seek for help.
    <br>There was a pastor I met who gave me N10,000.
    <br>I told him I was no looking for money for food but to get a place,
    <br>even if it meant I had to pack all my properties and keep them there.
    <br>He said he didn't have.
    <br>I came back that day so depressed.
    <br>As you can see this church, if you came here on a Sunday service, you would cry.
    <br>The evil spirit said it had swept everything away and sent it to the Indian Ocean.
    <br>I am the great lion.
    <br>I am the tiger...
    <br>Living where?
    <br>... from the deep sea of India.
    <br>He stays in that church.
    <br>He is a pastor.
    <br>Let him pastor.
    <br>He will pastor and eat the dust unless he accepts to come back to me and serve me.
    <br>He must serve me.
    <br>What have you done to his ministry, as a pastor?
    <br>Mnistry?
    <br>I swept everything, put it in a container and sent it to the ocean.
    <br>Where is the ocean?
    <br>Right where I come from.
    <br>Everything about him, I parcelled it and sent it to the ocean, the deep ocean of India where I come from.
    <br>He said that he had swept everything, parcelled it and send it to the Indian Ocean.
    <br>To compare that to what is happening to me;
    <br>if you came here on Sunday, people would stand outside and begin to laugh
    <br>because sometimes, the people here are not up to six or seven, or ten.
    <br>There was a service we had six, seven persons here.
    <br>They are just youths.
    <br>Some of them were students and not working.
    <br>I have suffered.
    <br>I would try everything I could but nothing would come out of it.
    <br>But I thank God that from the moment I was delivered, I have peace in my mind.
    <br>I want the man of God and Emmanuel TV to help me out of this situation.
    <br>Right now, the toilets that we normally use have been broken by the landlord.
    <br>There is nowhere for someone to go to the toilet.
    <br>Where I am supposed to use as an office is where we hide our things and cook.
    <br>As you can see, this is where I am supposed to have an office but we use here to cook
    <br>and to hide our possessions.
    <br>We are using the fridge here as a cupboard because it is not working.
    <br>We just kept it here as a cupboard where we put plates.
    <br>You can just imagine the suffering Pastor Ernest and his wife had been passing through,
    <br>to the point where broken fridge became a storage cupboard for their small assortment of a household
    <br>utensils and appliances.
    <br>The fridge is not working so we use it as a cupboard to put plates and other things
    <br>so that the place would not look dirty.
    <br>These are our bags and other properties which we keep up here, as you can see.
    <br>This is where Pastor Ernest and his wife are keeping their few earthly belongings they still own,
    <br>alongside two racks, where they keep their clothings.
    <br>This is the mat, foam and net which we normally used to sleep inside the church when the night came.
    <br>Just as the evil spirit that had previously possessed Pastor Ernest had confessed,
    <br>it has caused him poverty to the point where he and his wife were forced to sleep in their church,
    <br>due to their pitiable condition.
    <br>Bringing out an old mat and a piece of foam he moves into the church's centre to demonstrate
    <br>how the couple used to sleep every night.
    <br>This is where we used to sleep.
    <br>We would arrange it here, put four chairs and a mat on top.
    <br>I want to arrange it now.
    <br>Slowly laying out the mat on the hard floor, situated near to the pulpit where he would preach on Sunday,
    <br>Pastor Ernest proceeds to place four white plastic chairs at the edges of the mat.
    <br>He then unties and unrolls the old piece of foam and spreads it out on the mat.
    <br>The foam is worn out and is even falling apart due to its overuse.
    <br>The couple then drape a blue mosquito net on top of the four white chairs, to act as a cover
    <br>for a makeshift bed.
    <br>This is how we normally arranged the bed.
    <br>Then, we would enter inside and lie down.
    <br>The couple demonstrate how they would go to sleep every night.
    <br>You can just imagine the level the evil spirit had reduced this pastor to.
    <br>Truly, satan is a thief of our joy, comfort and dignity.
    <br>This is how we used to sleep because of the mosquitoes here.
    <br>DEMON POSSESSED By A TIGER!!!
    <br>This was my experience.
    <br>This is how we had been sleeping and suffering.
    <br>If you look at my appearance, you would think that I have everything.
    <br>I just tried to console myself and my wife would encourage me.
    <br>If not so, I don't know…
    <br>I just thank God that He has delivered me and I am now normal.
    <br>People that see me outside there don't believe that I don't have money
    <br>and there is where I slept, but this has been my life for a very long time.
    <br>I want man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners to help me out.
    <br>I want to show you the toilet which the landlord broke
    <br>and where we normally bath outside, because the landlord wants me to leave.
    <br>Pastor Ernest leads the Emmanuel TV team outside the church premises.
    <br>Let's hear from him about the challenges they faced everyday.
    <br>This is where we normally bath in the night.
    <br>Very early in the morning, we would come out here and fetch water from well and bath here.
    <br>We would take water from the well here.
    <br>This old dilapidated well was a source of water Pastor Ernest and his wife were forced to use.
    <br>Because of their condition they had to bath with this murky water everyday.
    <br>We would wake up very early and bath here so that people would not see us.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>This is the toilet which we normally used.
    <br>The landlord has broken the place as my time has expired to stay here.
    <br>This is the place we normally used as a toilet but the landlord has broken it
    <br>because I was asked to move within 14 days.
    <br>The toilet is in a terrible state, after it had been broken down by the owner, in protest of Pastor's Ernest
    <br>inability to pay rent for the premises.
    <br>A small hole is all that remains amidst the debris.
    <br>If I am to leave here, there is nowhere to go because I don't have money to rent anywhere else.
    <br>That is why I am begging the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners to help me out.
    <br>Locking the gate of the church behind him, Pastor Ernest and his wife return to the vehicle
    <br>they have arrived in with the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>One can just imagine what would be the fate of Pastor Ernest and his ministry if he had not come
    <br>to The SCOAN and received deliverance.
    <br>Given a notice to leave the premises immediately and with no money to move anywhere else
    <br>Pastor Ernest is pleading with Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners to support.
    <br>If not, he and his wife would be throst onto the streets.
    <br>My name is Rev. Ernest Davis Ekah.
    <br>Here beside me is my wife.
    <br>I studied Marine Mechanical Engineering in Poland.
    <br>I was working in a shipping company before I was sent to Poland to study for one and a half years.
    <br>We were 12 in number that were sent on that course.
    <br>When we came back, I was promoted to the office of a manager.
    <br>I was in that office.
    <br>After two months, there was a day during lunch period when I was in my office trying to study my Bible
    <br>and I heard a voice telling me, "I called you to serve me. Now, it is time. You have to leave your work to serve me".
    <br>I even discussed with some of my friends.
    <br>They said, "But you are the manager; everything is OK for you. How can you go and serve God?
    <br>To be a pastor, you are going to suffer".
    <br>I was struggling with those words.
    <br>After about two weeks, I forwarded my resignation letter.
    <br>When I left the work, I had to go to Bible College and I began to study.
    <br>After I graduated, I started a ministry.
    <br>Things were fine for the first four years.
    <br>What do you mean by "things were fine for four years", when you started?
    <br>The ministry was OK; a lot of miracles happened.
    <br>Everywhere was filled to the brim, even outside.
    <br>After four years, I had an encounter with a woman; we got married.
    <br>That was where my problem started.
    <br>When I saw that everything was upside down,
    <br>she sent me out of the house because we were living in her house.
    <br>She asked me to leave the house if I could not live by her rules.
    <br>I had no choice but to stay in the church.
    <br>I want to salute our woman here, that had been beside you.
    <br>What a wonderful woman - we salute you.
    <br>You know the reason why I said it.
    <br>Assume, it was this man alone facing all this, and there were no woman like this beside this man;
    <br>he would have committed suicide.
    <br>If I'm talking to you let me see your hand.
    <br>He would have committed suicide.
    <br>And two; if he had not committed suicide, he would have never thought of deliverance.
    <br>And I know his coming here is because of this woman.
    <br>Man of God, you are saying the right thing; I was about to commit suicide.
    <br>That fateful day, somebody came in and saw the rope I tied.
    <br>I was fed up with life because to live and eat was a problem for me.
    <br>I could be dressing like this – people did not know that these were all I had.
    <br>My wife did not know my predicament before we got married.
    <br>When I said that I lived in the church, she thought that in the church was a house,
    <br>a building where we would live like other churches have.
    <br>She did not know that it was right in the church after service we'd sleep.
    <br>My name is Mrs Sibongile Ernest Ekah
    <br>I come from Lesotho, South Africa.
    <br>Before I met my husband, I had been longing to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>One day, I met him on the internet and after some time, we got married.
    <br>He told me he was living in a church.
    <br>I came here.
    <br>When I came here, I was taking care of him because
    <br>I found that the life he was living was not something to write home about.
    <br>Since I have been with him, we have always been fighting.
    <br>He was wild, so I always begged him that we should come here.
    <br>At times, we would agree that we'd come but if we did not meet the man of God, he'd say,
    <br>"See, you said we should come here; I will not come here again".
    <br>Then, we would start quarrelling.
    <br>I thank God that today, he has received his deliverance.

    <br>We want to salute you - thank you very much.
    <br>One thing we salute you for - you are the point God used to keep this man alive.
    <br>If not you, this man would be in his grave by now.
    <br>I know all the members will come together; I too want to join the family.
    <br>I want to join your family.
    <br>First, how you can leave that place and get your property -
    <br>at least a two bedroom apartment, settle down and we can pray with you.
    <br>We can pray with you and ask God the next line of action.
    <br>Sky will be your limit.
    <br>I want to join your family - thank you very much.
    <br>You help me to give them one million naira.

    <br>Look. Amen. Sit down.
    <br>Educated South African Woman flying from South Africa and marrying a Nigerian, who is an engineer,
    <br>a manager in the company.
    <br>Herself is also a manager in the company in South Africa - they are coming together
    <br>and satan wants to ruin their lives just like that.
    <br>We should not allow that.
    <br>Look at the personalities involved.
    <br>Can you see - they are giving them bags of rice.
    <br>Now, you are to get them two bedroom flat today.
    <br>You know... when you leave here today - by tomorrow you will be able to get this two bed room flat,
    <br>or three bedroom flat.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>Come on, madam!
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>What God is using Pastor T.B. Joshua to do -
    <br>all of us sit here, watch and clap hands.
    <br>It is not enough.
    <br>He has done so much to touch the lives of everybody, including myself.
    <br>The church does not have any profitable venture; it is from this man, Pastor T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What he is doing, he is challenging us.
    <br>It is not enough to clap hands; we must start doing something.
    <br>He brings every Sunday no less than 10-20 million Naira.
    <br>Where is the money coming from?
    <br>So, today, I am going to give the couple five million Naira.
    <br>Thank you!
