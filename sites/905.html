    <br>Right now, begin to bind all the spirits of tradition in your life.
    <br>The spirit of fear. The spirit of doubt.
    <br>Begin to bind this spirit. Bind it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>You know what I mean by the spirit of tradition?
    <br>The way you believe, the manner you believe God is not right.
    <br>If the way you believe is the right way, the sky will be your limit.
    <br>You are just like the father of the demon-possessed boy.
    <br>He ran to God, "I believe, help my unbelief".
    <br>There are two beliefs.
    <br>One, traditional belief, another one, the genuine one.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to bind that traditional belief.
    <br>Bind it right now, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray.
    <br>Begin to bind the spirit of fear, the spirit of doubt.
    <br>The man of God said, we should continue to bind the spirit of fear,
    <br>the spirit of doubt in our lives, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Release yourself from any inherited bondage.
    <br>Begin to release yourself.
    <br>Release yourself, release yourself.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>When you know the protection you are under, you fear no more.
    <br>When you know the protection you are under, you doubt no more.
    <br>When you know the protection you are under, you panic no more.
    <br>If you know the protection you are under, let me see your excitement.
    <br>You need just a word.
    <br>As you stand, begin to meditate in your heart, "Jesus loves me".
    <br>Say, "Jesus loves me".
    <br>- I can't hear you.
    <br>- Jesus loves me!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to release yourself, in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>Begin to release yourself from any inherited bondage.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Release yourself from any business setback.
    <br>Release yourself.
    <br>Business setback.
    <br>Financial crisis.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Let your mind tell you that you are free.
    <br>This is what should go through your mind, "I am free".
    <br>If the Son sets you free, you are free indeed.
    <br>I want to pray for you right now.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, begin to be released.
    <br>I release you from inherited bondage.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, I release you, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>You are released, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Spirit of killing, stealing and destruction - out!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>The Spirit of God is exposing those that possess contrary spirit in the midst of the people.
    <br>Spirit of killing, stealing and destruction - out!
    <br>In your business - out!
    <br>In your marital life - out!
    <br>In your spiritual life - out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Watch the screen of your television set and see what is happening.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Spirit of killing, stealing and destruction - out!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In your business - out!
    <br>In your spiritual life - out!
    <br>Say, "Out!"
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever spirit that is disturbing you - out!
    <br>That is disturbing your house - out!
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Say, "Out!"
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>The kingdom of satan is in disarray, and you can see what is happening.
    <br>The authority of God is exposing those that possess contrary spirits in the midst of the people.
    <br>Continue to watch as God's power is moving mightily in the midst of the people.
    <br>We want to deal with deliverance.  So if you are in a cage, I am telling you,
    <br>you will be out of that cage today.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Right now, begin to express your belief.
    <br>Express your belief.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Whatever that is not planted by God - say, "Out!"
    <br>Open your lips; say, "Out!"
    <br>Watch the screen of your television set as you are commanding out all of the problems in your life,
    <br>all the things that are not planted by God and see what is happening to that woman.
    <br>You can see, as  the man of God is moving closer, she is running away from the man of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Continue to watch your screen as an evidence that God Almighty...
    <br>Come here!
    <br>More and more of the agents of killing, stealing and destruction are being exposed.
    <br>As the man of God flicks his wrist, the fire of the Holy Ghost is consuming all the negative power
    <br>in this woman's life; see the way she reacts as the power of God moves all over her body.
    <br>Walking in circles, she is under the delivering influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Overcome, she falls to the ground.
    <br>Spirit of killing, stealing and destruction - out!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>The Spirit of God is exposing those that possess contrary spirits in the midst of the people.
    <br>Killing, stealing and destruction - out!
    <br>This woman falls to the floor under the anointing of God as the evil spirit in her is being exposed.
    <br>She is one of many who possessed contrary spirits that, were arrested by the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You can see that man manifesting right there, the evil spirit inside of him. You can see what is happening.
    <br>There's another man, see how he falls down.
    <br>Down he goes under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Stretch your right hand.  The right hand of God is power.
    <br>Begin to receive!
    <br>Receive!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Throughout the prayer, this man was crouching, trying to hide and cover his ears.
    <br>But when the prophet drew near, he ran.
    <br>Look, don't hold him. Before I count to two, come here.
    <br>One, two!
    <br>Run after me.
    <br>I will keep you three beatings and you will be delivered.
    <br>The man of God said, "I will whip you spiritually and you will be free".
    <br>He's free!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>After the man of God came to the man in the spirit, he was delivered. Praise God!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Right now, let us pray for the viewers all over the world.
    <br>Where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Receive, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>If you have not known the Lord Jesus, say after me, "Lord Jesus, I am a sinner, come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul, in Jesus name!
    <br>Right now, begin to confess whom you are.
    <br>I'm justified. I'm no longer condemned.
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past.
    <br>I'm redeemed.
    <br>I'm saved.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Listen to the prophetic message for you. Are you ready?
    <br>There is a table before you.
    <br>Listen, on top of this table are essentials of life.
    <br>Essentials of life are on the table -
    <br>joy, peace, kindness, breakthrough.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>There are tables; right now, you cannot see it and I am prophesying to you.
    <br>Listen to me, I can see a table right in front of you.
    <br>On top of this table, breakthrough is on top.
    <br>Redemption is on top.
    <br>Salvation is on top.
    <br>Blessings are on top.
    <br>Prosperity is on top.
