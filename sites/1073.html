  <p>    
    <br>My name is Asnakech Thomas. I come from Ethiopia.
    <br>My testimony starts like this: First of all, Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>In 2011, I had a tummy like a barrel. I thought it was not pregnancy; that was for sure.
    <br>When I went to the hospital, they said that I was having a fibroid and needed to undergo an operation.
    <br>Then, I went to my friend. She said to me, "Don't have an operation, go to SCOAN".
    <br>So, I came to The SCOAN. I actually had to go to the overflow.
    <br>I prayed there and also received the Morning Water.
    <br>Then I went back home. I sprayed the Morning Water on myself and also drank it.
    <br>In 2012, I went for a checkup at the hospital and they still said I needed to have an operation. I said, "No".
    <br>In 2013, I didn't even bother to go to the hospital. I was just praying and praying
    <br>and everything, to my surprise, just disappeared.
    <br>This is what you see me now.
    <br>We really want to understand your testimony.
    <br>You said, after you came here... First of all, what conviction did you have to come here
    <br>after your friend told you, "No, don't go for an operation! Go to The SCOAN and get the Morning Water!"
    <br>What convinced you to just come all the way from your country to The SCOAN?
    <br>Was it like you watched your screen and your faith was encouraged?
    <br>What encouraged you to come down and get the Morning Water?
    <br>When my friend told me about The SCOAN, I didn't have the channel.
    <br>But then I bought the cable and installed it in my house.
    <br>As far as in my farm - by the way, I am a farmer.
    <br>I also got it installed on my farm, since I am a farmer.
    <br>Watching Emmanuel TV, coming here and collecting the Morning Water gave me strength.
    <br>And as I was praying, everything started turning around.
    <br>So, that was how I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>So, when you ministered the Morning Water on that fateful day, what did you experience?
    <br>You said it disappeared but how did it disappear? What did you experience?
    <br>Did you experience things coming out of you?
    <br>Yes, in a way. I didn't actually see something popping out
    <br>but a thick, creamy substance was coming out gradually.
    <br>It was really smelly. That was how it gradually came out completely.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>In 2014, I went back to the hospital to check if it was still there,
    <br>whilst knowing that God had already taken the sickness away.
    <br>They told me that nothing was there.
    <br>This is the first medical report that showed that I had a problem.
    <br>This is the last medical report which says that I have nothing whatsoever.
    <br>What was the problem again?
    <br>It was fibroid.
    <br>It was fibroid?
    <br>Yes, it was multiple fibroid.
    <br>So, the first medical report is showing that you then had multiple fibroid.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And the second one says...
    <br>Nothing whatsoever.
    <br>- That you are free?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>That is not all.
    <br>Because I'm living in the countryside, being a farmer, I had to take the television down to the farm
    <br>to watch Emmanuel TV. We didn't have lights so I had to buy a generator.
    <br>So when I came in, we put it on and I was at the farm the whole day.
    <br>I tried very hard to succeed.
    <br>I have two kinds of farms now. I have a diary farm with 150 animals
    <br>and a coffee farm of 96 hectares of land.
    <br>When you came here, what challenges were you then having in your career?
    <br>Sickness, worry, and going here and there to hospitals.
    <br>I was always thinking of when I would go back to work.
    <br>It is a long way away -  550 km away from the main town.
    <br>I was just worrying a lot - also about the expenses at the hospitals for the treatment.
    <br>Then, I sprayed the Morning Water all over the farm as well.
    <br>I work with 7000 farmers - they are my farmers, I am their mum and we work together.
    <br>Then, God blessed me - not only with diary. This is a coffee farm.
    <br>These are prizes that I have won for the coffee.
    <br>This is how we wash the coffee.
    <br>Here are the farmers and myself in my farm.
    <br>So, your farm is booming now?
    <br>Yes, it is.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is not all.
    <br>I am the only female coffee producer and direct exporter from Ethiopia - my own brand.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So now, you are one with a difference.
    <br>Yes. These is my exporter license for green bean.
    <br>This is the exporter license for roasted coffee.
    <br>This is the organic certification to America and this is the one for Europe.
    <br>This is the internationally registered certificate.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>I employ around 300 to 600 farmers at the coffee farm, out of which 80% are women.
    <br>We encourage the women to open their own accounts which is difficult.
    <br>But if they don't open an account, I don't pay them.
    <br>That is how I empower and work with them.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Asnakech Thomas
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>These are leaflets of my coffee and my diary farms.
    <br>At the diary farm, I have 150 animals.
    <br>Two days ago, one diary cow gave birth to twins.
    <br>Ohh!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>This is how I support my 7000 farmers.
    <br>I give them incentives, train them on how to do the work perfectly and first class.
    <br>This is because I am known to be a seller of first-class coffee.
    <br>These trophies are for the first class, internationally.
    <br>So, these are the things the farmers learn from me as I train them.
    <br>We want to encourage you, Madam, to remember
    <br>that receiving healing and breakthrough is not the only thing you need.
    <br>You also need to cast aside your old self, your self-sufficiency, and take on the new life in Christ Jesus,
    <br>one that comes with humility and obedience to God's Word.
    <br>We pray that God will continue to order your steps, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
