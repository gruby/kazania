    <br>Man of God, please help me!
    <br>I cannot walk.
    <br>My spinal cord has shifted; I cannot walk. It has been for two years now.
    <br>Help me, man of God!
    <br>I am using a lumbar corset.
    <br>Man of God, help me!
    <br>My spinal cord has shifted.

    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>God, thank You very much.
    <br>You have done everything for me.
    <br>I have not been able to do anything for two years.
    <br>My wife has been carrying me up and down.
    <br>Thank You, God!
    <br>I can do everything.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Oh my God. Thank You, Jesus!

    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>I went to the National Hospital in Abuja, as I live in Abuja.
    <br>I went to the Indian Hospital in Karu.
    <br>I went to other hospitals as well - but all to no avail.
    <br>When I came here, God met me through Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>God met me!
    <br>Allow baba to rest.
    <br>Can't you see baba is out of breath?
    <br>Give baba a seat.
    <br>He is telling you how painful his past has been as an old man.
    <br>The same Hand that is touching you is the same Hand that removed his pain.
    <br>It is an example for you that your poverty is gone.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Prayer And Prophecy In Jesus' Name
    <br>Your hardship is gone.
    <br>By the time you receive your own, you will receive the mother of it [the most extreme].
    <br>Let's hear from those who have received a touch.
    <br>I touch you; I don't slap you.
    <br>It is just a tap.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua, don't go anywhere. I beg you.
    <br>Don't go to Israel - I heard you are going there.
    <br>I beg you.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Ok, it is alright.
    <br>Look, watch your screen. It is just a tap.
    <br>When you feel any pain, it means that it is spiritual pain; it is divine pain.
    <br>It is not physical pain.
    <br>If there is any pain that you feel when I tap you, it is not physical pain.
    <br>It is down to the root of your situation.
    <br>Look at this mama now. Watch your screen.
    <br>Do you see?
    <br>What is that? Just a tap.
    <br>- It is like shocking.
    <br>- It is like a shock.
    <br>I want to do it again.
    <br>How does it feel?
    <br>It feels like an electric shock.
    <br>Hold my hand and use it to tap you.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Demonstrating GOD'S POWER!!!
    <br>You are the one that slapped yourself. That is it.
    <br>Just see.
    <br>It is like what?
    <br>An electric shock.
    <br>It is going down to the situation - even the people that are not here that you are praying for.
    <br>Ok. See.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Demonstrating GOD'S POWER!!!
    <br>See.
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>It felt like an electric shock.
    <br>But there is no electricity here?
    <br>The finger of God!
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Demonstrating GOD'S POWER!!!
    <br>- What is here?
    <br>- It is a vibration.
    <br>Vibration in my hand?
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Demonstrating GOD'S POWER!!!
    <br>It is a shock, sir.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Prayer And Prophecy In Jesus' Name
    <br>Man of God, help me. I beg you.
    <br>Man of God, help me. I have a spinal problem; I cannot walk.
    <br>Man of God, help me. I have a problem in my prostate.
    <br>The same challenges that baba had are the same challenges you are having now.
    <br>Help me!
    <br>Use your hand - hold my hand to use it.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name.
    <br>Can you see? That is all.
    <br>Just holding my hand - it is not a slap.
    <br>Remove the lumbar corset. It is gone.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Go.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!
    <br>I could not do this before.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am delivered. I am free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>After I have tapped you, check yourself.
    <br>And if you have a case that you brought here, call the person.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Prayer And Prophecy In Jesus' Name
    <br>Sit down. You said what?
    <br>I have so many challenges in my ministry, daddy.
    <br>- In your ministry.
    <br>- Yes, daddy.
    <br>I know that it is only you who can assist me.
    <br>You are a minister of God. You have many challenges in your ministry.
    <br>So many.
    <br>I have seen you so many times in a vision. That is why I am convinced ...
    <br>Thank God that you are a minister of God.
    <br>If God had not sent me to you, you would not come here.
    <br>Look. Use your hand to tap yourself.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Demonstrating GOD'S POWER!!!

    <br>Man of God, please help me. I cannot walk.
    <br>Please help me. I cannot do anything; I cannot help myself. Please.
    <br>It has been for eight years now. Please, man of God, help me. Have mercy on me.
    <br>I have been to numerous general and private hospitals, but to no avail.
