    <br>Come here!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Demons only want to hear your voice.
    <br>They want to know whether your voice contains fire.
    <br>They want to know whether you speak by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It is not by touch but if it is a sick person, you can touch them.
    <br>But demons - watch.
    <br>Come out! Look here!
    <br>Do you hear the voice?
    <br>Ok, watch again.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, come out!
    <br>With an authoritative declaration, in the name of Jesus Christ, he is set free completely.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua begins to move in the midst of the pastors,
    <br>ministering prayer under the unction and direction of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>He is practically demonstrating the union of the Word and the Spirit
    <br>as had been preached earlier in the sermon.
    <br>As Apostle Paul said, "My preaching was not with wise and persuasive words
    <br>but in a demonstration of the Spirit's power
    <br>so that your faith would not rest on man's wisdom but on God's power."

    <br>I command you out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, out, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>She has taken away souls that I won.
    <br>I want to kill her.
    <br>She is preaching the Word of God alone.
    <br>And I don't want it.
    <br>The people present not only received impartation of the anointing of God but also healing and deliverance.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua was laying hands on the people, an evil spirit in a woman began to manifest.
    <br>Who are you? Come out!
    <br>I hate her.

    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua encounters a woman who has a problem with her wrist
    <br>and is using a wrist support.
    <br>God's power is working through God's Word and Spirit to bring healing in Jesus' name.

    <br>Lift it up!
    <br>All over the pastors' conference hall,  people are receiving impartation, healing and deliverance.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for this man, the spiritual entity behind his predicament is exposed.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>I created a barrier in his ministry and family.
    <br>I have always been in him.
    <br>His mother sold him to me for money.
    <br>Out! I said, come out!
    <br>Where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The light of God forcefully uproots the demonic spirits in the life of this man
    <br>and he uncontrollably flees from his seat but he is eventually halted.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Beelzebub.
    <br>I destroyed his family.
    <br>I hate him.
    <br>I want to destroy him.
    <br>There is a covenant.
    <br>I am from the ancestors - occultism.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua moves around praying for the people,
    <br>he comes across another woman having a wrist problem.
    <br>When your heart and mouth get in accord with God's Word,
    <br>it brings Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit to the scene.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord! He healed me!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Oh Lord, hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You very much, Lord!
    <br>I can move my hand! Thank You, Lord.
    <br>God is going to withhold the phenomenon of science and wonders
    <br>until two things coalesce, join, combine - the Word and the Spirit.
    <br>The Word is not complete without the Spirit
    <br>and the Spirit is not complete without the Word.
    <br>The Spirit lightens the Word of God.
    <br>God's Word speaks about His promises while the Spirit executes them.
    <br>As the Word of God and the Spirit of God work in harmony in the heart and mouth Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>it brings Jesus Christ to the scene.
