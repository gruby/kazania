    <br>Mr Fabian Idika, a police officer from Ebonyi State Nigeria,
    <br>has come to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations with the problem of leg ulcer due to a gun shot,
    <br>and also uses a walking stick for support.
    <br>The condition of his leg is in a horrendous state -
    <br>dead skin covers the surface of the leg and a bullet buried inside for many years.
    <br>This is an extreme case that has defied all medical solution.
    <br>The problem has gone beyond the power of nature,
    <br>and that is why Mr Fabian Idika has decided to commit his life under Someone wiser,
    <br>more clever and more powerful than himself: Jesus Christ who raises the dead!
    <br>As the camera pans to the right,
    <br>we can see an open wound has formed on the inner part of his leg below the calf muscle.
    <br>Mr Fabian Idika is believing Jesus Christ to rescue him from his deplorable health condition.
    <br>My name is Fabian Isaac Idika.
    <br>I am a police officer - ASP two stars.
    <br>What is the problem that has brought you to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations today?
    <br>I have a leg ulcer due to a gun shot.
    <br>I have been to many places,
    <br>but all my efforts have been to no avail.
    <br>And how has this problem affected you as a police officer?
    <br>There is no way. Without my wife, I would be nowhere in life.
    <br>We can see a walking aid with you here.
    <br>What do you use it for?
    <br>I use it to help support me to move.
    <br>Without it, I cannot move.
    <br>This is the first x-ray that I took the day I was shot,
    <br>and this is where the leg was broken.
    <br>That is the bullet wound.
    <br>That is the bullet itself inside my leg.
    <br>The second x-ray shows the screw they used to tighten the metal shaft in my leg.
    <br>Now that you are here, what do you believe that God Almighty will do for you?
    <br>I believe God will heal me.
    <br>MUST SEE!!! Bullet And Screw Come Out Of Man's Flesh!
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua, dominated by the Word of Christ,
    <br>ministers prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, to Mr Fabian Idika
    <br>and the mountain that stood between him and good health is removed.
    <br>Mr Fabian Idika falls to the ground, free to the glory of God!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus
    <br>Thank You Jesus for delivering me
    <br>A few weeks later Mr Fabian Idika came back to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>to testify to his complete healing.
    <br>On the left, we saw the dreadful state of his leg due to the gun shot,
    <br>and the horrendous condition of the skin that rapidly deteriorated day by day, despite medical assistance.
    <br>And on the right, the condition of the leg has reversed - the skin is completely restored.
    <br>The open wound is covered and he no longer uses the walking stick for support.
    <br>This is indeed the work of Jesus Christ who gives life, and life in abundance!
    <br>This is an incredible testimony that testifies that there is nothing impossible with God.
    <br>He is the God that makes impossibilities possible.
    <br>Mr Fabian Idika demonstrates what he could not do before the prayer,
    <br>such as the simple task of putting on sandals.
    <br>He can now wear his sandals with ease
    <br>and no longer uses a walking stick for support.
    <br>Jesus Christ is indeed the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>MUST SEE!!! Bullet And Screw Come Out Of Man's Flesh!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am very happy to be here today.
    <br>I never knew that I was going to live.
    <br>My name is Mr Fabian Isaac Idika
    <br>I am a retired police officer of the rank of ASP - two stars.
    <br>Some time ago, while in service, I had an encounter with armed robbers.
    <br>I was shot in the leg
    <br>and six policemen were killed instantly.
    <br>I crawled into a gutter.
    <br>The police from Enugu State came
    <br>and saw that the six policemen were already dead.
    <br>I crawled into a gutter; I was nowhere to be seen.
    <br>At a time, I raised up my hands
    <br>and they said they saw a finger in the gutter.
    <br>They came to the gutter
    <br>and already my leg was swollen.
    <br>They took me to the hospital.
    <br>At the UTH Enugu Hospital, I died.
    <br>When I gave up,
    <br>I went to another world where I saw my grandfather.
    <br>My grandfather said, "Who are you looking for?".
    <br>I said, "I am looking for my mother".
    <br>When I saw my mother, she asked me why I was there.
    <br>I said, "I am looking for you, mother".
    <br>She then said, "Isaac, go away from here".
    <br>I woke up and people were around my bed crying.
    <br>I asked them why they were crying.
    <br>They replied because I was dead.
    <br>I said that I was back;
    <br>that I went somewhere, and now I was back to base.
    <br>I went to many places for treatment,
    <br>but there was no solution - nowhere.
    <br>I went to the doctor and he gave me Augmentin
    <br>and the thing became worse.
    <br>When I would have a bath, I would cry.
    <br>My wife would be telling me not to cry,
    <br>that my crying was bad for her.
    <br>Whether it was hot water or cold water, I would be crying bitterly.
    <br>My neighbour would even come and ask me why I was crying.
    <br>When I came here on the 18th of January,
    <br>I was delivered.
    <br>I fell down and the ushers picked me up.
    <br>From there, I went to the bathroom and urinated for ten minutes.
    <br>The bullet and screw came out.
    <br>This is the bullet.
    <br>This is the screw and the bullet.
    <br>We can see on the screens of our televisions -
    <br>This is the screw and this is the bullet.
    <br>On its own, the next morning, the leg started itching.
    <br>The first that came out was the bullet.
    <br>The second thing was the screw.
    <br>This is where the bullet came out from - on its own.
    <br>I did not treat it again.
    <br>This is me.
    <br>Can you tap the leg?
    <br>Were you able to tap it like this before? Can you tap it like this before?
    <br>No!
    <br>Could you even stand straight like this when you were having that problem before?
    <br>All what you are doing now, could you do it in the past?
    <br>No, never! I could not even try it!
    <br>What are you doing now?
    <br>I am marching.
    <br>Put your hands together for Christ Jesus.
    <br>And also, sir, we want you to explain.
    <br>We can see some documents on the board next to you.
    <br>This was the first bullet when I was shot in 1979,
    <br>when six policemen were killed.
    <br>These were my first x-rays.
    <br>We can see the screw on that particular leg that is shown on the x-ray.
    <br>We can see the point showing the bullet on the leg,
    <br>and also we can see this hole where it was being tied, with the bones inside his body.
    <br>And after the encounter he had with the man of God at the prayer line section,
    <br>God Almighty, in His infinite mercy, removed all these things.
    <br>Physically they came out of his legs.
    <br>And now he is here testifying to the goodness of God Almighty.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus.
    <br>This is a picture taken during that embarrassing period.
    <br>This is my front and this is my back.
    <br>And how are you feeling now, sir?
    <br>Oh! I am okay.
    <br>Mr Idika Singing Praises To God
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Children of God, on the 30th of May 2014
    <br>I called my wife
    <br>and wrote an application to Ebonyi State University.
    <br>Then, they gave me an appointment to start with effect from 1st August 2014.
    <br>I will start work there as a senior security officer.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Put your hands together for Christ Jesus.
    <br>As a God of perfection,
    <br>when He starts something He always wants to conclude it perfectly,
    <br>because with Him all things are perfect.
    <br>With this wonderful thing that God Almighty has done in your life - it is a great healing -
    <br>and we know that with the blessing attached to it,
    <br>we want to encourage you that now that you have been healed, you have been blessed for God's glory,
    <br>continue to live the rest of your life for God
    <br>and let God Almighty continue to channel your path for His glory.
