    <br>EMMANUEL TV
    <br>15TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION
    <br>EMMANUEL TV
    <br>AN UNUSUAL BEGINNING
    <br>God's way of doing things is so mysterious.
    <br>You have to be very careful.
    <br>Even where you are working, no matter what happens.
    <br>Either they cheat you, they demote you - don't quit because of that.
    <br>You need to ask God the direction.
    <br>They may demote you. They may take the junior one and promote them above you.
    <br>They may cut your salary in half.
    <br>Don't, because of all this, quit.
    <br>You need to examine what is happening.
    <br>God can use any foolish thing to address you.
    <br>When I say 'foolish thing' - these are the bad things.
    <br>God can use any foolish thing to try to address you.
    <br>I have some good examples.
    <br>This Emmanuel TV here in Nigeria, I want to tell you a story.
    <br>When I was airing my programme on some channels
    <br>- I don't want to mention their names; even one of the national channels -
    <br>because of me, they banned miracles in Nigeria.
    <br>Just because of me; not because of anybody else.
    <br>And they told me that miracles were banned.
    <br>"How will I show my programme?"
    <br>They said, "Just talk".
    <br>Jesus is Lord.
    <br>I removed all my programmes from all the stations and I went to the mountain to pray.
    <br>God said, "Yes, I am aware. I want you to discover yourself. I will give you a channel called Emmanuel TV".
    <br>Emmanuel TV came.
    <br>The name 'Emmanuel' is too long. How will I write the whole 'Emmanuel TV'?.
    <br>And I looked at all the channels. It was either three or four letters,
    <br>but my own would be so long.
    <br>Can you see? That is human.
    <br>And God said 'Emmanuel TV'.
    <br>I now went to register 'SCOAN TV'.
    <br>The first month they were showing this. The channel was called SCOAN before.
    <br>The first month, second month.
    <br>In a vision I was being warned that "When you wake up, change this name to Emmanuel TV".
    <br>This was the instruction from God.
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMMANUEL TV
    <br>15 YEARS OF CHANGING LIVES!!!
    <br>We had to travel to another country.
    <br>That is how Emmanuel TV started.
    <br>And it is the most popular Christian channel all over the world.
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMMANUEL TV
    <br>15 YEARS OF CHANGING LIVES!!!
    <br>When that disappointment comes, God is speaking through that to you.
