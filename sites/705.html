  <p>    
    <br>My name is Emmanuel Newman C.
    <br>I am a Nigerian from Anambra State.
    <br>I reside in Gabon.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>I was suffering from the spirit of lust, masturbation,
    <br>smoking, womanising and drinking.
    <br>With all these, I became a Christian without being delivered.
    <br>I preached the Word of God and would evangelise.
    <br>Listen to that statement:
    <br>He said he became a Christian without being delivered
    <br>and that is thousand people today.
    <br>When you are a Christian and you are not delivered, you are religious.
    <br>There is a difference between Christianity and religion.
    <br>You don't need to be delivered before you become a religious man
    <br>but you need to be delivered to become a Christian.
    <br>Christianity is all about a relationship with Jesus
    <br>and Jesus is the Deliverer.
    <br>For you to have a relationship with Him, you need to be delivered.
    <br>The difference between Christianity and religion is:
    <br>Christianity - you need to be delivered to become a Christian.
    <br>You don't need to be delivered before you become what? - A religious man.
    <br>That is why today, if you see twenty people today gather and they say they are Christians,
    <br>out of these twenty, hardly one of them is a Christian.
    <br>All nineteen are religious people.
    <br>What are the characteristics of a religious man?
    <br>One of the characteristics is you see them always complaining.
    <br>"I have headache. I have pain. I have this. I have that."
    <br>In the face of their faith, they believe that their pain or trouble will kill them.
    <br>What else again?
    <br>"When is he going? Gradually, he is to go." - You will know he is a religious man.
    <br>Religious people always give a time to God.
    <br>I was preaching the Gospel and said I was a Christian
    <br>but this sin kept on tormenting me.
    <br>That masturbation became so much that I saw preaching as just fun
    <br>because people loved it but at a time, I gave up.
    <br>Through that sin, I went into smoking, drinking and living all kinds of lives.
    <br>This thing has cost me a lot of setback in life. I never made it.
    <br>Nothing worked for me.
    <br>My life became wayward and I started thinking;
    <br>this Jesus might be just an ordinary religion, like I understood other religions,
    <br>just ordinary belief. Maybe He did not exist because to say the truth,
    <br>the miracles we are seeing here, I have not seen them anywhere in the world.
    <br>I read so many books during the time when I was preaching
    <br>and teaching the Word of God but I had not seen this kind.
    <br>One of my friends first of all introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I said, "No, we have heard about this man!
    <br>People said a lot about him.
    <br>Forget about it!" But he said, "No, I had to watch this".
    <br>I said, "No, I don't want to watch this".
    <br>Even in our church, they asked us not to watch all other Christian channels,
    <br>especially like The SCOAN.
    <br>One day, I visited one of my friends and he was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I heard a message while watching Emmanuel TV that said,
    <br>"If you make a mistake as we all do, don't run from God, run to God".
    <br>I saw the message and told the guy, "Please, don't switch off this station",
    <br>I just wanted to see whether it was the man of God, T.B. Joshua, that was saying this.
    <br>I thought he must be saying something important so I watched the message.
    <br>I heard a lot of messages that I had not heard before - very slow and powerful.
    <br>This message turned my life around.
    <br>I asked my friend, "How can I get this station?"
    <br>He said, "Just buy a decoder. I will call one of the technicians to place it for you".
    <br>I said, "Okay". I had to do everything quickly because that message touched me.
    <br>Because of this sin, I was running away from the Word of God.
    <br>I didn't like hearing the Word of God.
    <br>It made me afraid; I would think God hated me.
    <br>This message gave me hope and courage that there was still hope for me.
    <br>That even the man of God was saying,
    <br>"If we make mistakes as we all do, don't run from God; run to Him".
    <br>I said, "Okay, let me see. Since I have run before to God,
    <br>the way I claim, but I am still masturbating. So, let me see.
    <br>I will just keep on watching this station and see what will happen.
    <br>So, I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I saw the miracles that were happening.
    <br>The things I had read in the Bible, I started seeing it physically.
    <br>I said, "Wow, this might be a film or something. I don't know".
    <br>I told one of my friends that what I saw on Emmanuel TV was exactly what the Bible said.
    <br>He said, "It is happening". I asked, "In my country, Nigeria?" and he said, "Yes, in Nigeria".
    <br>I said, "Ah!"
    <br>I said that now I wanted to see the power of God.
    <br>I sat down. I was with my packet of cigarettes, still living the same life
    <br>but the one thing that kept me going on was when he said, "If we make mistakes,
    <br>we should not run from God". I said, "God, I will not run from You now.
    <br>I will watch You until You change my life".
    <br>I was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So when the man of God said, "Lay your hand on the screen and pray",
    <br>I was still doing the same things. I stubbed my cigarette.
    <br>Even my brother can bear witness.
    <br>One of my brothers came to my sitting room and said,
    <br>"You are watching the things of God and you are still smoking.
    <br>You do not respect God".
    <br>I said, "No, this is beyond me. It is God that will do it".
    <br>So, I went to the screen and laid my hand on the screen
    <br>while the man of God was praying.
    <br>Immediately something left me but I didn't take it as anything.
    <br>So, I just went away. The decision just came to me. I packed my cigarettes.
    <br>There was one in my kitchen, sitting room, even inside my car.
    <br>I went down to the car and took the packet there.
    <br>I packed everything and threw it in the dustbin.
    <br>I went to my room because CDs of pornographic films filled my house.
    <br>I just picked them up and threw them into the dustbin
    <br>and said I wouldn't do this again.
    <br>I just left and forgot about everything.
    <br>The most surprising thing was cigarettes.
    <br>I left, forgot about the prayer and went to my normal business.
    <br>I didn't smoke. This started around three o'clock.
    <br>I didn't smoke. I even forgot about cigarettes 'til the next day.
    <br>I went with my friends to a restaurant. We went to go and eat.
    <br>My friend was a smoker too. After eating, he bought a stick of cigarettes.
    <br>He offered them to me. It was then I remembered. I said, "Please, I won't smoke.
    <br>Could you imagine that since yesterday, I laid my hands on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>prayed and forgot all about cigarettes".
    <br>He said, "Forget about that. We know you. I take sticks but you smoke packets.
    <br>How can you say you can just stop cigarettes just like that?"
    <br>I said, "No, I won't smoke. Keep your cigarettes".
    <br>From there, I started imagining. It was as if I had never smoked before.
    <br>This deliverance is real. It is as if I had never smoked before.
    <br>So, if you want to be a Christian and you are still struggling with that urge,
    <br>it is religious. You just need real deliverance.
    <br>Once you are delivered, you would know that you are a different person entirely.
    <br>I started looking at myself and wondering what had happened.
    <br>It was as if I had never smoked before. I couldn't hold myself.
    <br>I started telling people. People were laughing.
    <br>People that knew me well said, "You have started again.
    <br>We knew you before when you were carrying the Bible.
    <br>Now, you have come again".
    <br>I said, "No, this one is different.
    <br>Before, I just did it myself but now Jesus has decided to take over everything".
    <br>It is not drama.
    <br>When you just stretch your hand along with me, that is the end!
    <br>The Spirit of God will enter you, and you will stop those bad habits!
    <br>Now, viewers all over the world, I want to give you; now, it is time.
    <br>Listen once again. You have listened to our brother; receive yours now.
    <br>As you watch God's power,
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot heal; never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>As you watch God's power, never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>As you watch God's power, trust Him; your situation will change.
    <br>Are you sick? Touch Him; you will be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Are you poor? Be blessed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever name you call that sickness, never a sickness Jesus cannot heal!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Believe Him; your needs will be met, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>If you have eaten through dreams or from the table of your enemy, adversary
    <br>or from the table of demons, be delivered, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
