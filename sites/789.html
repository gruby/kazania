  <p>    
    <br>A woman and her two young children were seen outside The SCOAN,
    <br>distressed and in a very emotional state late at night.
    <br>The attention of the Emmanuel TV team was called to their case and they came to find out what had happened
    <br>to this family.
    <br>Let us listen to them.
    <br>My name is Christie Pua.
    <br>I came from Indonesia.
    <br>And who are the two people standing beside you?
    <br>They are my children; Fredrick and Blessing.
    <br>Can you explain the reason why you have come to The SCOAN this evening?
    <br>I am looking for favour from the man of God.
    <br>We have been living here.
    <br>We have run from the village because they accused my husband for being a murderer -
    <br>that he killed his own father.
    <br>After a few months, his niece died and they accused my husband for being the murderer who killed his niece.
    <br>That is why we ran away from the village to Lagos without anything.
    <br>We managed to sell the remaining things in the house only for the transport money.
    <br>Now, we have become like beggars in Lagos – we don't have any place to stay.
    <br>That is why we ran here – we want to look for the favour of the man of God.
    <br>Who is the father of the children?
    <br>His name is John Ken Egesi from Imo State.
    <br>I have been married to him for the past 16 years.
    <br>How did you meet with him?
    <br>We met in Indonesia when he was doing his business.
    <br>He was selling garments and exporting clothes.
    <br>Some years after we married, he said I should come and be introduced to his family in Nigeria.
    <br>I have been here for the past five years, living in Imo State with him, suffering.
    <br>The worst part now is that they accused my husband of murdering his own father and niece.
    <br>That is why we are here now.
    <br>We have no other place.
    <br>My husband is just hustling.
    <br>Sometimes he goes to Alaba and at the end of the day, he brings only 100 or 200 naira.
    <br>How can we eat with 200 naira with these kids?
    <br>Every day, we have to pay for the lodging place.
    <br>Now, they have asked us to pack out and we have no other place to stay.
    <br>How old are your children?
    <br>This one is thirteen years old and this one is five years old.
    <br>Please, man of God, help us!
    <br>Help my little family!
    <br>Where is your husband now?
    <br>I don't know where he is.
    <br>He went out in the morning as usual, hustling and he knows that we no longer have any place to stay.
    <br>I just decided that I cannot live like this any longer.
    <br>My name is Frederick.
    <br>I was born in Indonesia, then, we came to Nigeria.
    <br>Frederick Egesi.
    <br>Since that time, me and my mother and sister have always suffered, all the time.
    <br>Sometimes, we cannot eat and we didn't know what to do any longer.
    <br>In the village, they accused my father of killing somebody.
    <br>That was the problem that brought us to Lagos.
    <br>Food is very hard for us to get.
    <br>Before we eat…
    <br>In our hotel, we don't have money so, we are owing them.
    <br>They have sent us out.
    <br>They are telling us to pack out because we have not paid their money.
    <br>The money we owe them is a lot.
    <br>Since two months, we have been in Lagos and to eat is very hard.
    <br>My daddy – I don’t know where he is.
    <br>He went out in the morning and has not come back.
    <br>He used to go to Alaba and help people so they will give him money.
    <br>That is the only thing he used to do.
    <br>Sometimes, he will come back empty handed.
    <br>He would not hold any money.
    <br>Then, we will not eat.
    <br>We will just sleep until the next day.
    <br>He will be always owing people.
    <br>Now, we have a lot of debts to pay.
    <br>We owe a lot of people now.
    <br>This is our bag because they seized our other bag.
    <br>They seized it because we have not paid the hotel accommodation fee.
    <br>They seized it so this is the only bag we use to manage and come out.
    <br>DEEPLY EMOTIONAL Video That Will Make You CRY!
    <br>My sister's clothes, my mother's and my own clothes and a blanket.
    <br>These are the only things you have for you and your family?
    <br>Yes, the only things we have.
    <br>I came with my own passport but my two kids don't have any ID with them right now.
    <br>It is only me who has my own passport.
    <br>Can we see your documents?
    <br>Yes, of course.
    <br>DEEPLY EMOTIONAL Video That Will Make You CRY!
    <br>This is my passport.
    <br>It is only I who has a passport.
    <br>When we came to Nigeria, we used Travel Certificates.
    <br>Since then, they don’t have any ID, only I do.
    <br>We don’t have any money because since we came to Nigeria, nothing is working for us - nothing at all.
    <br>Please, we are coming here because we know there is solution in this very place – The SCOAN.
    <br>We used to see on Emmanuel TV that the man of God used to help people.
    <br>That is why this is our last bus stop.
    <br>I believe man of God, that our case will not run from you.
    <br>I believe you will help us.
    <br>I don’t even have one naira with me now, as I am talking.
    <br>Even my kids have not eaten since afternoon – we only had a little breakfast this morning.
    <br>Please, man of God, help us!
    <br>My name is Blessing.
    <br>My daddy is not around – he went to Alaba.
    <br>He is looking for money.
    <br>No food – we don’t have money.
    <br>The first thing the Emmanuel TV team did on hearing their pitiful plight was to take them in, give them a good
    <br>hot meal, something to drink, and the place to stay for the night.
    <br>Our first response as Christians is love.
    <br>No matter what situation we find ourselves in or what situation we are presented with; we should love first,
    <br>and walk in the light of love.
    <br>Love is the greatest because God is love.
    <br>After meeting Mrs Egesi and her children, SCOAN representatives called Mr Egesi,
    <br>to inform him of their whereabouts.
    <br>He responded by also making his way to the church.
    <br>The following Sunday, they came out to share their heart-rendering experience.
    <br>Let's listen to them.
    <br>My name is Christie Pua.
    <br>I'm from Indonesia.
    <br>I'm 37 years old.
    <br>These are my children, Frederick and Blessing; he is 13 years old and she is 5 years old.
    <br>The man standing beside them is John Kennedy Egesi, my husband.
    <br>I met my husband in Indonesia about 16 years ago, when he was doing business in my country.
    <br>Since then, we have been married.
    <br>My son Frederick was born in Jakarta (Indonesia) and this one was born in Pakistan.
    <br>After some years of our marriage, my husband decided to bring us to Nigeria to meet his parents.
    <br>I didn't know that on our coming to Nigeria everything would just turn around.
    <br>Nothing worked for us to the extent that we began to suffer greatly.
    <br>I never imagined that we would suffer so much in Nigeria; it was too much for me.
    <br>Even every day I had to cook with firewood, so I had to fetch wood from around the compound.
    <br>If that was not enough, the remaining wood I would give to my son to sell, to get money.
    <br>She said, ever since then she had never expected this kind of difficulties that she, her children and husband
    <br>have been going through.
    <br>Because of these terrible difficulties they have been going through, every morning she had to go to the bush
    <br>to fetch firewood, and after fetching the firewood she was giving some of it to her son to go around the street
    <br>to try to sell it, in order to make money for them to meet their daily needs.
    <br>Not only firewood, when it was the season for aboli, I would pick it around the compound.
    <br>I would clean it, then send my son to take it to sell at the market or if there was eko,
    <br>I would clean it and send him to sell it in the marker.
    <br>All the things I did were to help feed me and my children.
    <br>It's not only me who suffered but my son, he would go to dustbins to pick bottles and things for him to sell
    <br>to help me – to earn a small amount of money from it.
    <br>They dropped out of school for a long time.
    <br>For us to even eat was very difficult, talk less of taking them to school.
    <br>As if all the suffering I went through, for me past five years in Nigeria, was not enough;
    <br>our condition continued to get worse as time went on.
    <br>When my father-in-law died, they accused my husband that he killed my father-in-law.
    <br>After a few months, the niece died and they also accused my husband that he killed the niece as well.
    <br>Before, it was sad but now things have become more tough again, tougher than before.
    <br>After everything that has happened, I cannot bear it again.
    <br>I would plead with my husband every day,
    <br>“Please, I don’t want to lose our lives in this village, I want to live.
    <br>I have left my county for so many years, I still have my family there.
    <br>I don’t want to return only by name.
    <br>It’s better we secure our lives, anything we gather we can sell it.”
    <br>We sold our television and generator for us to get transport to come to Lagos to secure our lives.
    <br>That is why we are here in Lagos.
    <br>We suffered and ran from the village, when we reached Lagos, we still suffered.
    <br>That is what made us to come to The SCOAN to look for help from the man of God.
    <br>Please, man of God.
    <br>Man of God help me and my family.
    <br>I want to go back to my country; I don’t want to live in Nigeria any more.
    <br>Five years is enough for me, please man of God.
    <br>How can I continue living like this?
    <br>I don’t want to and I cannot.
    <br>Even the clothes that I and my children are wearing, someone gave them to us.
    <br>Think about that kind of life – I don’t want it, please man of God.
    <br>There was a clip to show how she was suffering; she was going to the bush, gathering some firewood
    <br>in order to cook for her family.
    <br>Yet, the suffering still continued.
    <br>Since we arrived in Lagos my husband tried to hustle and would go out every morning,
    <br>hustling to get money for us to eat.
    <br>But after much effort my husband would return with only 100 or 200 at the highest 500 naira.
    <br>What can we use that money for when we need to eat and pay for accommodation?
    <br>My name is Frederick, this is my mother, sister and my father.
    <br>Since the day we came to Nigeria we have been suffering – all the time.
    <br>To the extent that I would go to the bush to pick things to sell.
    <br>Bottles and other things just to help my mother.
    <br>I’m not going to school, even my sister is not going to school; we have dropped out for a long time.
    <br>I want the man of God to help us so we can leave this country, we have suffered a lot.
    <br>Please man of God, help us.
    <br>My name is John Kennedy Egasi
    <br>I am from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>The people beside me are my wife, son and little daughter.
    <br>We lived abroad for a long time but after some time, I decided to bring my family home.
    <br>I brought them home, everything was fine before I came home.
    <br>But all of a sudden, when I came home everything turned around.
    <br>Things started going bad; nothing was working out.
    <br>Even to the extent that they accused me of killing my father who we had been taking care of.
    <br>How can I kill my father?
    <br>They accused me and started calling me names and all sorts.
    <br>When the insults became too much – we couldn’t take it anymore, we decided to come to Lagos.
    <br>We sold our generator, television and things to get to Lagos.
    <br>When we got to Lagos, we tried to find a place to stay that would cost little like 1,500 naira.
    <br>We stayed there paying 1,500 naira everyday but things got worse and worse.
    <br>I decided to be going out to hustle, to help people doing business or something like that.
    <br>Along the line, still nothing was working out.
    <br>When I would finish work, after working hard they would give me 200, 500 at the highest 1,000 naira.
    <br>I was not able to pay for the house rent again.
    <br>Even sometimes, we would sleep without eating.
    <br>Everything was upside down, it has been too stressful on my side.
    <br>On Friday, I was trying to get home, I was walking on foot because I can’t always afford the bus -
    <br>sometimes when I enter the bus, they push me down.
    <br>I was trying to get home on foot when I got a call around 12 o’clock.
    <br>It was an evangelist calling me from The SCOAN.
    <br>I asked what the problem was.
    <br>They said they had found my wife and kids at their street.
    <br>I asked what had happened.
    <br>They said they were crying, saying they had not been eating and no one knows.
    <br>I shed tears and from there, I managed to get to this place.
    <br>I want to first of all thank the man of God for taking care of my wife from that Friday.
    <br>Mr Egesi & Family
    <br>Sharing Life Experience
    <br>You can see how pathetic the situation is.
    <br>We quite understand that it hasn't been easy at all.
    <br>Let us listen attentively.
    <br>I want to first of all thank the man of God for taking care of my wife since that Friday to this moment;
    <br>I want to thank him so much.
    <br>From that time till now, that is how we are.
    <br>This is how I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I thank the man of God for the help he has given to my wife
    <br>and I am still begging him if he can help them so they will be able to achieve
    <br>what they want from the man of God.
    <br>My own is different, there’s no problem, I’m a Nigerian.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for this moment.
    <br>We believe that man of God will definitely come to your aid.
    <br>"To spend more on others and less on ourselves".
    <br>We are going to hear from the man of God very soon.
    <br>Whatever the man of God is going to do, we will be able to assist you and take you out of the
    <br>problem you are facing and wipe out your tears, in Jesus' name.
    <br>After accommodating Mr Egesi and his family and listening to their pitiful life experience, T.B. Joshua
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV Partners assist them to enable them to get back on their feet with a renewed hope
    <br>and a fresh beginning.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>This is really marvelous to see the transformation that is happening in the lives of the people.
    <br>This family's life has really been transformed.
    <br>They came here in tears of sorrow.
    <br>God Almighty used His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua to transform their life.
    <br>It was indeed a radical transformation.
    <br>Truly, we cannot afford as Christians to look the other way when our brother is in need.
    <br>We have been called as Christians to respond to all human needs; for that is what love entails.
    <br>We have seen the manifestation of this in the life of the family.
    <br>We can see them with smiles of joy.
    <br>We can see a big difference.
    <br>We saw them first time when they came to The SCOAN  some weeks ago.
    <br>Anybody would hardly recognize this family some weeks ago because you see that something marvelous,
    <br>something wonderful, a great transformation has indeed occurred in their life.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!
    <br>We are going to hear directly from them, how God Almighty has indeed blessed them.
    <br>Can we just hear from you?
    <br>What you have to say concerning what God has done in your life?
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>[Good Morning.]
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Help me to thank God for everything He has done for me and my little family.
    <br>Mrs Christie Pua & Family
    <br>My name is Christie Pua.
    <br>I came from Indonesia.
    <br>I am 37 years old.
    <br>As you have seen before in the video, those were the things that brought me and my little family
    <br>to The SCOAN looking for the favour of the man of God.
    <br>The video as you can see is our past.
    <br>Christie Pua & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>We are here today to thank God for everything He has done for us
    <br>and to thank the man of God for allowing himself to be an instrument and problem solver for us.
    <br>I also want to thank the Emmanuel TV Partners all over the world
    <br>and The SCOAN for what they have done for me and my little family.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>As you were watching the clip; when you came to The SCOAN, there were some complains you made.
    <br>You also made your request known to the man of God, Emmanuel TV Partners and viewers all over the world.
    <br>Today, can you tell us what can you say about your request that has indeed been made?
    <br>I really thank God for everything.
    <br>Man of God has made our wish come to pass.
    <br>Here is my passport and my children’s documents and as you can see here,
    <br>these are our tickets to go back to Indonesia for me and my children.
    <br>We heard from the lady; the first time she came to The SCOAN the complain was that only she had a passport
    <br>but her children had no documents.
    <br>Despite the fact she had a passport, there was not way she could have traveled back to her country.
    <br>That was a complain she made.
    <br>We give glory to God that today man of God has indeed rescued them out of that terrible situation.
    <br>As we heard from the woman - what she said just now; that the man of God has indeed
    <br>procured them a passport.
    <br>We can see her holding her own passport and two passports of her children, that were procured
    <br>by the man of God.
    <br>Not only that; she has pointed to the documents we have seen on the board next to them.
    <br>These are tickets for their travel back to their country - Indonesia.
    <br>We want her to go beside the board and explain to us what the documents are all about.
    <br>Christie Pua & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>These are our airline tickets provided by the man of God for me, my son and daughter.
    <br>These are the documents I need for me as a Nigerian’s wife.
    <br>We are going back on Tuesday.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully!
    <br>That clap is not enough for Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together louder and louder for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!
    <br>This is a woman that came here crying, in pain and sorrow because they were in a terrible situation.
    <br>All hope was lost.
    <br>She never had any idea for getting out of this problem.
    <br>But through His Anointed Servant - Prophet T.B. Joshua, whom God has been using to bless millions and millions
    <br>all over the world - today, their life is transformed.
    <br>Today, she can talk about procurement not only of the passports and documents for her children but also visa
    <br>and tickets for the travel back and to start life anew in their country - Indonesia.
    <br>Once again, shall we put our hands together for the living God!

    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Not only that, the man of God has spent a lot of money on us for our documents, accommodation
    <br>and all the necessary things that have to do with us.
    <br>Altogether, it is about six million naira.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Christie Pua & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>We heard her earlier speaking in the clips that she was given a sum of $3,000 USD
    <br>to establish her financially when she gets back to her country Indonesia.
    <br>We also watched how the husband was given a sum of 500,000 naira, to establish himself financially here.
    <br>A visa for her and passports for her children were procured, together with traveling tickets
    <br>and all necessary documents, aside from the fees and expenses for transportation to be able to procure
    <br>these documents.
    <br>She is telling the whole world that this money sums up to 6,000,000 naira.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Madam, having seen what God Almighty has done in your life; can you tell us what you have to say about
    <br>our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?
    <br>What advice you have for millions and millions of people listening to you all over the world, regarding what God
    <br>had done in your life?
    <br>Before I give my advice, I would like to thank The SCOAN evangelists.
    <br>Since we have been here, they have been preparing us spiritually.
    <br>The man of God has catered not only for our physical needs but also spiritual needs as well
    <br>for us to keep hanging onto God.
    <br>My advice to those all over the world and everyone here is, “Don’t run from God; run to Him"
    <br>because God has something to say in every situation.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We have heard from the woman that she was blessed not only financially;
    <br>her spiritual life has also been enriched.
    <br>Since she has been here at The SCOAN she spent time listening to the Word of God
    <br>and her spiritual life has indeed been enriched.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Christie Pua & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>We want to ask our sister a question.
    <br>We know that God Almighty never considers our past in order to determine our future.
    <br>God Almighty has indeed forgiven our past; the past of the sister, her children and her husband as well.
    <br>We want to ask you sister; can you tell the whole world and viewers all over the world
    <br>that are listening to you right now - with a hope you will not disappoint your husband, since God Almighty in His
    <br>own infinite mercy has wiped away your past and given birth to your future -
    <br>can you tell us that you don't disappoint your husband and you see through to him?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We are still going to continue communicating because it doesn't matter where we are.
    <br>It is only distance that is between us but our love and care cannot be separated by distance.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Thank you, man of God.
    <br>May God bless you abundantly and give you long life and prosperity.
    <br>Anything you touch shall prosper, in Jesus’ name.
    <br>Amen. Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>We have heard from the woman that she just promised the whole world that she would not
    <br>disappoint her husband.
    <br>Even though they may be far apart physically, the distance does not affect their marriage and their union.
    <br>Their love remains and the love of God will continue to hold them forever.
    <br>Once again, put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Right now, we want to hear from the husband.
    <br>Christie Pua & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Hallelujah, we give glory to God for what we are witnessing right here at the live Sunday Service
    <br>at The SCOAN.
    <br>We are so much blessed by watching what God has done in the life of this family.
    <br>We have one more question for you madam.
    <br>As you are going back to your country Indonesia with your two children, we want to ask you,
    <br>"Are you going to train up your children in the way of the Lord, so as they grow up they will not depart from it?"
    <br>The whole world is watching.
    <br>They have witnessed what God Almighty has done in your life.
    <br>These children are now under your care.
    <br>Observing the evil happening all around the world, we want to ask you one more time,
    <br>"Are you going to train up your children in the way of the Lord, so as they grow up they will not depart from it?"
    <br>Yes, I promise to train my children in the way of the Lord by the grace of God, in Jesus’ name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah, we give glory to God.
    <br>We have heard from her a promise to the whole world that she will train up these children
    <br>in the way of the Lord.
    <br>Man of God always advises us that we should follow God's instruction for our life, and His instruction
    <br>will set us on the good route to the good life.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>We heard from the wife.
    <br>We now want to listen to the husband.
    <br>Christie Pua & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Sir, you are welcome.
    <br>Can you introduce yourself and tell what you have to say concerning what God has done in your life?
    <br>Good Morning Church!
    <br>[Good Morning.]
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>I am John Kennedy Egesi from Imo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am very, very happy about what the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners have
    <br>done in the life of my family.
    <br>I am very happy about that.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to thank them so much.
    <br>I am more than happy at this very period because if you watch me now and watched before,
    <br>you will see that I am like a bank manager now.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>This man is appreciating God for what He has done in his life.
    <br>Indeed, if you watched the clips from their arrival to SCOAN and you see them now, hardly you will recognize
    <br>that it is the same person.
    <br>Not only his spiritual and financial life has been transformed but also the physical appearance.
    <br>Looking at them, you can know that God has indeed done something wonderful and marvelous in their life.
    <br>The brother can not contain this, as he speaks out and glorifies the Name of God to the whole world.
    <br>Once again; put your hand together for the miracle working God.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I am so happy; I really want to thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners across the world.
    <br>I am thanking the evangelists for the way they helped us here with accommodation and everything else here.
    <br>I really thank them so much.
    <br>The man of God supported me also with the sum of 500,000 naira.
    <br>Now, I cannot be pushed out of a bus and I won’t travel by foot anymore.
    <br>I will be able to establish my life before my wife and children come back again.
    <br>I really thank the man of God.
    <br>John Egesi & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>We have heard from the brother who said that with that gift of 500,000 naira he received from the man of God -
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, his financial life has been totally transformed.
    <br>He will be now able to establish himself financially out there, in the world.
    <br>No more running around on bare foot, no more being humiliated or embarrassed in the public,
    <br>because God indeed has used His anointed servant Prophet T.B. Joshua to bless him financially.
    <br>Hallelujah, we give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>Right now, I am bouncing in the Lord.
    <br>I want you to help me to really thank the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>I am very joyful and happy about all the blessings I have received here.
    <br>Not only that but opening doors of breakthrough; so many people who didn’t call me before
    <br>have started calling me.
    <br>John Egesi & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>There are a lot of breakthroughs now with calls here and there.
    <br>There was even one of my brothers whom I called a long time ago
    <br>and I know he did not see the clips but it is the effect of the prayers here -
    <br>this the arena of liberty for sure!
    <br>John Egesi & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>What I was planning before now, the doors are open, in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>I am really happy about that.
    <br>Hallelujah, let us put our hands together once again for Jesus.
    <br>We have heard from the brother that since he entered The SCOAN;
    <br>apart from the financial and spiritual blessings that he has received from the man of God
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, all the breakthrough doors have been opened.
    <br>He has been receiving breakthroughs in every area of his life.
    <br>Coming of this woman to The SCOAN has brought family union and immense blessing in their lives.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>We want to ask the husband one vital question.
    <br>As your wife will be travelling to Indonesia with your two children and they are going to start a new life there
    <br>in Christ Jesus,
    <br>and the wife was asked the question earlier and she made a promise, we want to ask you a question,
    <br>"Are you going to promise the whole world now that you will remain faithful and loyal to your wife,
    <br>even while you are not together physically?"
    <br>She knows quite well that sometimes I can make calls for two hours when we are not together,
    <br>talk less of now that the hand of God is involved.
    <br>For sure, we will continue to be together; distance is not a barrier.
    <br>You have heard the promise from the husband that distance is indeed not a barrier,
    <br>that although they may not be together physically but the love of God is binding them together.
    <br>He will remain truthful and faithful to the wife.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>He said that communication would not be a problem.
    <br>We give glory for this restoration of peace, unity, happiness in this family.
    <br>God Almighty has indeed established them financially.
    <br>Their spiritual life has been transformed and today they can talk of a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Children of God, million thanks is not enough to glorify the Name of God
    <br>for what He has done in the life of this family.
    <br>Who could have justly done this?
    <br>It is none other than our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
    <br>They came here in tears of sorrow, discomfort, pain but today tears of sorrow have been totally wiped away,
    <br>by God Almighty through the Anointed Servant Prophet T.B. Joshua, and we give Him all the glory.
    <br>Put your hands together once again for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
    <br>Finally, we want to hear from the son.
    <br>We know he will also have something to say concerning what God has done in their live.
    <br>John Egesi & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>People of God - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Frederick.
    <br>I thank man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners and people who work here
    <br>for all they have done for us since we have been here.
    <br>I thank the man of God for everything he has done for us.
    <br>He made our passports, got visas and paid for our tickets to go back home to Indonesia.
    <br>God bless you, sir.
    <br>You will never lack, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Frederick & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Because of what the man of God has done for us, I will not go back and be picking up bottles to sell
    <br>and in the process of that, receive many insults.
    <br>My past is already my past indeed.
    <br>I will not go through that again.
    <br>Frederick & Family
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>I thank all of you – viewers, man of God, Emmanuel TV Partners for all you have done for us.
    <br>Please, pray for my father.
    <br>We give glory to God for this day of testimony in your life.
    <br>Your family is a living testimony to the mightiness and goodness of God in lives of the people.
    <br>It can educate the people out there that may be in the same condition as this family was before.
    <br>No matter the situation you may be going through; you should trust in the goodness of God Almighty.
    <br>Continue to appreciate Him because faith requires us to speak before we see or feel the result.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty that today we are happy and rejoicing in the Lord for what He has done
    <br>in the life of this family.
    <br>That is what Christianity is all about.
    <br>The man of God says that we are indeed called as Christians to respond to all human needs.
    <br>We appreciate God Almighty for using His Anointed Servant Prophet T.B. Joshua to transform the lives
    <br>of these people.
    <br>Today they can go back there and start a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together beautifully for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We have heard from them what God has done in their life and we give glory to God for His mightiness
    <br>and goodness in their life.
    <br>As the wife has said, she would be travelling to her country to start a new life and the husband too,
    <br>has been established financially, spiritually here.
    <br>He has promised that distance is not a barrier; the love of God still stands and holds them together.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>I want to advise you, as the children of God.
    <br>The God Almighty has done mightily marvellous things in your life.
    <br>He has done all this for the salvation of your souls.
    <br>Make sure, wherever you may be, to continue to follow His instruction daily for your life.
    <br>Make sure, as you promised madam, that these children will be trained up in the way of the Lord,
    <br>so when they grow up they will not depart from it.
    <br>We look forward to see you very soon with more and more testimonies of fulfilment of God's blessings
    <br>and promises in your life.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.

    <br>Once struggling in abject poverty in a foreign land, now God has wiped away the tears of Mrs Egesi

    <br>I thank God; I really thank God.
    <br>As we are about to go, we met the man of God in his office just now and he was asking me
    <br>what my future plan was and I told him my heart desire to build an orphanage in Indonesia.
    <br>I am an orphan and I know what it feels like to be an orphan.
    <br>I have passion to help the needy, those who are less privileged.
    <br>The man of God was very happy with my future plan.
    <br>He also assisted me and has given me $3,000 USD.
    <br>I will start to build my orphanage and help people, in Jesus’ name.

    <br>Charity Testimony
    <br>I am addressing my Indonesia people that they should come and feel the presence of God

    <br>Amen.
    <br>Emmanuel.
    <br>My name is Frederick.

    <br>As Mr Egesi embraces his family as they get ready to embark on their journey, he is also at peace
    <br>as the man of God has blessed him with the sum of 500,000 naira to establish himself in Nigeria.
    <br>Mr Egesi & Family
    <br>After a long and painful struggle he has found rest in the house of God, where Prophet T.B. Joshua took in him
    <br>and his family, accommodated them and made all their travelling arrangements to start a new life.
