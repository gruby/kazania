    <br>OUR OWN ROLE
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You are welcome here to the Anyang Sports Complex in Anyang, South Korea
    <br>where we are awaiting the arrival of the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua in South Korea.
    <br>We are expecting to see mighty miracles of God.
    <br>We are expecting to see the lame walk, the deaf hear and the blind see.
    <br>Because all of these blessings have been promised to us in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thousands of people have already filled the inside of the stadium
    <br>in hope and anticipation to have an encounter with Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Bible teaches that the age of miracles has not stopped.
    <br>The Miracle-worker is still alive.
    <br>His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Today we are here to celebrate the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>We are here to see the power and effectiveness of Jesus Christ working in the Spirit.
    <br>So, as you join with Prophet T.B. Joshua in the service, remain blessed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Korea For Christ Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>This is Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He has trained many disciples from all over the world.
    <br>I want to introduce him to you; he performs apostolic work like Peter.
    <br>Korea For Christ Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Let us welcome and greet him.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I would like to introduce Prophet T.B. Joshua from Nigeria.
    <br>He is the overseer of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations in Nigeria.
    <br>He has been travelling all over the world by the power of the Holy Spirit -
    <br>tremendous apostolic power of God prevailing all over the world.
    <br>The Korean people have a great privilege here - we give glory to God!
    <br>As he comes before you, let's give a big praise to God. Hallelujah.
    <br>Greetings to you all
    <br>with the love of our Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>I am excited and honoured
    <br>to be in your midst today.
    <br>Jesus Christ never succeeded alone.
    <br>This means, there is more to 'Amen' if two agree.
    <br>Let us agree that Jesus Christ is our Saviour.
    <br>Our message today is titled 'Our Own Role'.
    <br>I mean, 'Our Own Part'.
    <br>And we shall take our reading from the Book of John 11.
    <br>I will read verses 1, 21, 22 and 24.
    <br>First and foremost, it is never late to start believing and obeying God's Word.
    <br>I want you to tell your neighbour: It is never late to start believing and obeying God's Word.
    <br>Obeying God's Word seems difficult, until we come to know that all He asks is for our good.
    <br>John 11:1 - "Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha".
    <br>John 11:2 - "This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick,
    <br>was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord
    <br>and wiped his feet with her hair".
    <br>OUR OWN ROLE
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>John 11:21 - " 'Lord,' Martha said to Jesus, 'if You had been here, my brother would not have died'."
    <br>John 11:22 - " 'But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask'."
    <br>John 11:23 - "Jesus said to her, 'Your brother will rise again'."
    <br>John 11:24 - "Martha answered, 'I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day'."
    <br>John 11:25 - "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life,
    <br>He who believes in Me will live, even though he dies;
    <br>and whoever lives and believes in Me will never die'."
    <br>Do you believe this?
    <br>Remember our message today: Your Own Part.
    <br>You have a part to play.
    <br>It is not just all up to God;
    <br>certainly it is not just all up to you.
    <br>It takes both God's ability and your willingness to receive redemption.
    <br>For your needs to be met,
    <br>for you to be healed,
    <br>for you to be saved,
    <br>for you to be blessed -
    <br>you have a part to play.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You have a part to play.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I have a role to play.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: It is not just all up to God;
    <br>certainly it is not just all up to you.
    <br>It takes both God's ability
    <br>and your own willingness
    <br>to bring redemption,
    <br>to bring salvation,
    <br>to bring healing,
    <br>to bring blessing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I have a role to play.
    <br>The question now: What is my role?
    <br>Let's look at the role Martha played.
    <br>Martha showed an absolute faith in Jesus,
    <br>saying, "If You had been here earlier, Lazarus would not have died".
    <br>"Even now, You have come so late".
    <br>"I believe whatever you ask God, that He will do".
    <br>Do you have that kind of faith?
    <br>It takes God's ability and your own genuine desire to receive the redemption.
    <br>This is not a matter of saying, "Man of God, help me! Pray for me!". It is a matter of self-examination.
    <br>Ask yourself these questions: Do I believe? Do I believe it can be done?
    <br>These are the questions you need to ask yourself,
    <br>and as you ask yourself, you are asking yourself if you have played your own role before coming here.
    <br>I want to take you to a Scripture in the Bible that talks about belief.
    <br>Mark 9:23 is all about a young boy who was possessed by demons.
    <br>He was brought to the disciples,
    <br>and the disciples could not deliver the boy.
    <br>Then the father came to Jesus.
    <br>Jesus said something to the man, and so forth.
    <br>Yes, 'so forth'.
    <br>I'm taking you to the Book of Mark 9:23 - " 'If you can?' ", said Jesus.
    <br>Mark 9:23 - 'Everything is possible for him who believes'."
    <br>Can you see why I said, 'so forth'?
    <br>If you can (believe), Jesus said that everything is possible.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>I want to bring the message to what is in our day to day activities.
    <br>This means, what is possible for me is based on my capacity to believe Jesus is the Lord, the Redeemer, the Healer.
    <br>What is possible for me may not be possible for you.
    <br>Look at this message here (Mark  9:23): "If you can (believe), all things are possible".
    <br>Take note, the Bible does not say, "Some things or little things are possible", but "all things".
    <br>Your belief can increase or decrease; it depends on how you fill your soul with God's Word.
    <br>Now, we want to look at what is possible for me may not be possible for you,
    <br>or what is possible for you may not be possible for me, in the name of Jesus. Why?
    <br>Find time to read the Book of Romans 10:8-10.
    <br>When Paul Apostle was preaching the Words of faith to the people of Rome,
    <br>he taught them that the Words of faith are in two places -
    <br>in their hearts they believe;
    <br>with their mouth they confess.
    <br>This means confession is part of salvation, just as believing is part of salvation.
    <br>If what is possible for me, in the name of Jesus, is not possible for you, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>what is restricting you is not on the outside but on the inside.
    <br>Looking at life - its storms and adversities - from the outside is a trap of satan.
    <br>That is, it brings worries.
    <br>When you look at me from the outside, you say, "He's a Nigerian; a young man. What can this man offer? He's too young to be a man of God".
    <br>It is a mistake for you to look at me from the outside.
    <br>Remember, in our hearts we are made to be like Jesus - not on our face.
    <br>Your face can be oblong or round. You can be white or black. You can be short or tall. That does not matter.
    <br>In our hearts we are made to be like Jesus.
    <br>There is not enough physical strength to stop satan.
    <br>There is not enough mental strength to stop satan.
    <br>Can you see why you should not look on the outside?
    <br>The only way satan can be stopped is when we walk in the Spirit in Christ Jesus.
    <br>The believer does not have strength as long as he operates from the outside; in the natural he has no strength.
    <br>Now, you need to reset your belief so that all things can be possible.
    <br>Say: I need to reset my belief according to Joshua 1:8.
    <br>What does it say?
    <br>To reset your belief, keep the Words of God in your mouth,
    <br>meditate day and night in that Word,
    <br>and do what the Word says.
    <br>This is the way to the Kingdom.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: This is the way to the Kingdom.
    <br>You have to believe, that is your connection. Tell your neighbour: I have to believe, that is my connection.
    <br>Let me give you a good example.
    <br>In Luke 11 when you start reading from verse 9,
    <br>it is impossible to teach the non-seeker.
    <br>The Bible says, "Ask, you shall be given; seek, you will find; knock, it shall be opened".
    <br>I cannot help anyone who desires a different outcome than I do.
    <br>If you are here today and you are not here for the salvation of your soul, I cannot help you.
    <br>The Book of Amos 3:3 says, "Can two walk together without agreeing on the direction?"
    <br>We cannot walk together without agreeing on the direction.
    <br>Ok, you go this way.
    <br>We can only walk together when we agree on the direction.
    <br>You see, I cannot help anyone who is going in another direction than I am going; I cannot help you.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired
    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
