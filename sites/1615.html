  <p>    
    <br>Let someone say, "Son of David, have mercy on me."
    <br>Let Your favour and Your divine mercy speak for me.
    <br>Say, "Lord, manifest Your strength in my weaknesses."
    <br>I thank You for every moment of Your attention, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Welcome in His presence.
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "Neighbour, welcome to His presence".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, welcome!"
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you happy?"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>We are happy because Jesus is in our midst.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Do you know God knows you better than you know yourself?
    <br>Say, "My life is in God's hands".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, I am not here by accident. It is the promise of God to give birth to me,
    <br>to bless me, to save me, to deliver me.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Say, "That's why I'm here".
    <br>Thank You, Lord Jesus.
    <br>Jesus is the reason we are here this very morning.
    <br>Jesus is the reason of our gathering this morning.
    <br>The Bible says whether the world laughs or frowns at us, it is an enemy.
    <br>That is why the Scripture warns us today.
    <br>Don't be too quick to trust.
    <br>Find out what God says.
    <br>But when we are looking for a leader, when we are looking for a man of God,
    <br>for a Christian, for a believer, we are always tempted to look at the externals.
    <br>We tend to consider speaking skills - I mean, ability to inspire -
    <br>education, genealogy or natural descent.
    <br>But the Bible says we must look past appearance to the heart.
    <br>Let someone say, "God looks at the heart".
    <br>No man can read the heart but God can.
    <br>Matthew 15:8 says that God knows those who are following Him closely.
    <br>He says, "I know My sheep, and I know them by name".
    <br>So, if you have chosen to follow the Lord in Spirit and in truth, you know the mind of Christ.
    <br>Let someone say, "The mind of Christ is meant for those who have the Spirit of Jesus Christ".
    <br>When you have the mind of Christ, you will know His will, you will know His way,
    <br>you will know His projects, His intention of everything that happens to you.
    <br>You will know God's point of view.
    <br>This leads us to our message this morning:
    <br>A MAN AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you a man or woman after God's own heart?"
    <br>Ask yourself!
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Acts 13:22.
    <br>I read from verse 22; it says:
    <br>"... when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king,
    <br>to whom also He gave testimony and said, 'I have found David the son of Jesse,
    <br>a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.' "
    <br>Let someone say, "Who will do all My will. Who will do what is in My heart."
    <br>In the Book of 1 Samuel 16:6-22, David was considered the least suitable
    <br>according to man's standard.
    <br>But by God's recognition he was the right person, the right man - a man after God's own heart.
    <br>God looks at the heart.
    <br>The man of God says the heart refers to the inner man, the inner self, the real you, the man himself.
    <br>The heart is the seat of desire, will, emotions, wisdom, knowledge,
    <br>conscience and moral character.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you a man after God's own heart?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour again.
    <br>If you are a man after God's own heart, you will feel what Jesus feels,
    <br>you will know what Jesus knows, you will see what has not yet been seen,
    <br>you will say what has not yet been said.
    <br>Ask David and he will tell you that if you are to be a man after God's own heart,
    <br>you have to go through God's processing.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, if you are to be a man after God's own heart,
    <br>you have to go through God's processing."
    <br>What is that processing?
    <br>The Bible says anointing of God does not work through methods, plans, machinery;
    <br>it works through suitable men and women.
    <br>Anointing is the coming of the Holy Spirit into a person's life
    <br>to set him apart for God's special service and blessing.
    <br>Let someone say, "Anointing does not work through plans, methods or machinery;
    <br>it works through suitable men.
    <br>Ask your neighbour again, "Are you a man or woman God created for His glory?"
    <br>To be suitable means to receive heavenly acceptance.
    <br>To be fit, to be suitable, we must be reformed.
    <br>We have to be melted.
    <br>We have to be remoulded and we have to be filled.
    <br>We have to be melted first.
    <br>When you pass through the process of being melted,
    <br>you still need to be remoulded to fit Christ's standard.
    <br>And once you are remoulded as a vessel,
    <br>you still need to be filled with the Holy Spirit before you can be suitable for God's service.
    <br>Brethren, we need to be melted first.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because the Bible says the glory of God cannot suffer corruption
    <br>and we all come a long way full of unrighteousness.
    <br>And for many of us, the process has not started yet - we are still in the raw stage:
    <br>a stage where we are too much of ourselves,
    <br>a stage where we are too much of where we are coming from.
    <br>That is why we need to go through the process.
    <br>If anyone refuses to go through this tiny step,
    <br>he will not be able to fulfill what God has designed him to achieve in His master plan.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, we have to be melted."
    <br>The Bible says what God has designed you and me to achieve in His master plan
    <br>may not be situated in your father's house,
    <br>may not be situated in your country
    <br>but today many are still remaining in the warm arms of their parents, of their country.
    <br>They are afraid to venture into the cold arms of society
    <br>where the necessary lessons about life are learnt.
    <br>There is a battle, there is in the heart a struggle between the flesh and the spirit -
    <br>whether to believe or not, whether to believe God's calling or not.
    <br>That is why so many people today whom God has called to a position of leadership
    <br>still find themselves in the position of a follower.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because they trust in man's majority, rather than God's authority.
    <br>They still wait for their parents to agree,
    <br>they still wait for their friends to agree,
    <br>they still wait for their community to agree
    <br>before they step out in boldness and take God at His Word.
    <br>Ask Apostle Paul and he will tell you in Galatians 1:15-17,
    <br>"When it pleased God to reveal His Son to me I did not consult any man".
    <br>It means if you have a sense of destiny, you will not look to people for direction;
    <br>you will step out in the direction of God's calling for your life.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, we need to be melted."
    <br>In the process of being melted, there is the process of stripping.
    <br>Where God strips us of everything we counted dear, those things that hold us back,
    <br>so that we start believing God's authority rather than man's majority.
    <br>Our way of thinking, our way of life need to be reformed to suit Christ's purpose for our lives.
    <br>God melts us, God refines us through tribulation, trials, temptation.
    <br>The impact of those trials on ourselves separates us from impurities, pride,
    <br>arrogance, anger, resentment and causes the character of God to grow in our lives.
    <br>Let someone say, "True humility is total dependency upon God for everything."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, are you melted? You need to be remoulded."
    <br>We need to be remoulded.
    <br>Why?
    <br>If you are to be God's person, an evangelist
    <br>you must go through the process of being remoulded.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because we are concerned about building character.
    <br>Let someone say, "We are concerned about building character."
    <br>It is essential that we serve God with a willing heart.
    <br>A willing heart is a willing servant.
    <br>Let someone say, "A willing heart is a willing servant."
    <br>God is concerned about relationship - relationship forever.
    <br>That is why He said, "Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness".
    <br>If you are a man after God's own heart, then you have a 'hugged' heart with God.
    <br>When you have your mind agree, your heart agree, in relationship with Jesus,
    <br>the Bible says that what is seen - whether you are healed or not,
    <br>whether you are blessed or not, whatever happens in your life, marriage, business -
    <br>that cannot affect your relationship with Jesus.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, we need to be filled to be suitable for God's purpose."
    <br>Serving God without the Holy Spirit is serving a God we do not know.
    <br>Human spirit fails in doing so unless the Holy Spirit fills.
    <br>The Bible says the Holy Spirit is God's imperative of life.
    <br>He is a Giver of all life.
    <br>A new way of life, a new way of following God starts living in us
    <br>when Christ's Spirit starts dwelling in our hearts.
    <br>Let someone say, "A new way of life, a new way of following God
    <br>comes when God's Spirit starts living within us."
    <br>The man of God said it is the will of God for everyone to be filled with the Holy Spirit
    <br>because no one can speak on His behalf without His instinct.
    <br>In this world without faith, without hope, no one can stand for the truth,
    <br>no one can live right and stand for the truth without Him.
    <br>No one can obey the written Scriptures without the Spirit of God.
    <br>The Word and the Spirit are linked together.
    <br>We are made spiritual by living in the Word and the Word living in us.
    <br>Let me see your Bible.
    <br>Say, "This Word is the living presence of His divine power.
    <br>This Word is the living presence of Christ's divine power."
    <br>I am in it.
    <br>You are in it.
    <br>The picture of your future is in it.
    <br>Say, "My success is in it."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Bible says to live in the Spirit, keep in the Word,
    <br>live in the Word and let the Word live in you.
    <br>Be saturated with the Word of God
    <br>and you will find yourself overflowing with the Spirit.
    <br>The Word is Christ building Himself in us as it rules, dominates and sanctifies our spirit nature.
    <br>That's the Word of God.
    <br>When the Spirit of God came on the apostles on the day of Pentecost,
    <br>He enhanced their natural faculties,
    <br>He renewed their strength by filling them with power from on high
    <br>and then He confirmed their offices as apostles and people of God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, what is your dream?
    <br>Do you know what God has made you for?
    <br>It does not just happen.
    <br>There is a process."
    <br>God used hatred to melt Joseph's confidence in man.
    <br>God gave to Joseph a dream, a picture of his future greatness known to him alone.
    <br>But the moment Joseph shared his vision with others,
    <br>his brothers became hell-bent to frustrate, to destroy that dream.
    <br>But God used hatred, jealousy, resentment to release him into his divine future.
    <br>No matter what you are passing through, no matter His calling in your life,
    <br>God sometimes allows foolish things to come our way
    <br>to prepare us for the best, which is yet to come.
    <br>It is in the midst of trials, temptation, hatred
    <br>that God got Joseph to the place where He used him as a channel of blessing.
    <br>What is your dream?
    <br>What is your vision?
    <br>What is the promise of God for your life?
    <br>A dream is a roadmap.
    <br>Say, "My dream is my roadmap."
    <br>For that dream to be fulfilled, you must go through divine processing.
    <br>Our conduct, our character, our behaviour must be altered,
    <br>must be changed to suit Christ's standard.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Are you ready to be melted?
    <br>Are you ready to be remoulded?
    <br>Are you ready to be filled?
    <br>The Bible says one's input determines one's output.
    <br>The way and manner we have been processing our lives
    <br>is what is working for or against us today.
    <br>No matter what you are experiencing today,
    <br>whatever stage you are in in this divine process,
    <br>the Bible says broken things become useful in the hands of God.
    <br>Let someone say, "Broken things become useful in the hands of God."
    <br>Finally brethren,
    <br>for every purpose of God in our lives to be fulfilled there must be a process
    <br>because Jesus Christ is concerned about our future.
    <br>Jesus does not want us to end up one day saying,
    <br>"I could have been... I should have been... I would have done..."
    <br>God loves us; God values us because we are the dwelling place of His Spirit -
    <br>our heart is God's temple.
    <br>Let someone say, "God values us.
    <br>God values me because I am the dwelling place of His Spirit."
    <br>Our heart is God's temple but the Holy Spirit cannot dwell in an unholy place.
    <br>That's why Jesus is busy building character now -
    <br>so that when we get to a place of destiny we may not crack, explode and lose it all.
    <br>Let someone say, "Jesus is busy building character now."
    <br>Let someone say, "I am a work of art."
    <br>My future, my destiny, my career, my life, God's goal for my life is being refashioned now.
    <br>Let someone say, "Now."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, those whom God calls for any service He makes them fit for it.
    <br>Are you a man after God's own heart?
    <br>Follow God's process and the best is yet to come.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
