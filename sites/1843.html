  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today
    <br>Thank you viewers for staying tuned.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We believe you have been encouraged by the message and the prayers.
    <br>We have also received numerous emails from our viewers expressing their concern
    <br>for their elderly family during this time.
    <br>We would like to read one of these emails to you.
    <br>This email is coming from Mr. Nkosi from the UK.
    <br>Man of God, please help us.
    <br>My elderly mum and dad have started wearing their face masks permanently
    <br>because of fear of contracting COVID-19,
    <br>and only removing them when they want to eat beacuse they need to use their mouths to eat.
    <br>I am concerned that this can be dangerous.
    <br>How can I advise them?
    <br>Thank you for your concern.
    <br>Thank you very much for sending in your question, and we have a response to this matter
    <br>from Prophet T.B. Joshua, which we would like to read for you now.
    <br>Following global health guidelines during this period of COVID-19,
    <br>the government is insisting on the use of face masks in public places -
    <br>along with social distancing and handwashing.
    <br>Face masks can be a very good thing but they can also be dangerous
    <br>when they are not used properly or when they are not made with the proper material.
    <br>The government has asked you to wear face masks
    <br>when you are in public places, in the midst of people, on the streets, in vehicles when you are not alone.
    <br>The government is doing this to help you.
    <br>They are not asking you to wear it 24 hours a day.
    <br>There should be a time at home when you remove it.
    <br>But some people are wearing their face masks for long periods of time.
    <br>Breathing the same air in and out or not getting enough air while breathing -
    <br>all of this can affect your health, cause headaches, fatigue and worsen existing health challenges.
    <br>So let us be careful of the amount of time we wear the face mask
    <br>and also of the kind of material our face masks are made out of.
    <br>For many, the chemicals used to make such material can be dangerous to inhale.
    <br>NOTE: The face mask is your personal mask.
    <br>It should be clean, made of proper material.
    <br>This requires your discretion, viewers.
    <br>Right now, let us pray.
    <br>Whatever is affecting your discretion - reason well, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Reason according to God's direction, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Reason in line with God, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Viewers, sometimes hardship can influence our reasoning.
    <br>Sometimes joblessness can influence our reasoning.
    <br>Sometimes fear can influence our reasoning.
    <br>Sometimes pressure can influence our reasoning.
    <br>Right now, begin to reason well, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to reason in line with God, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to do the right thing, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Do the right thing, in Jesus' name!
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray!
    <br>Viewers, we continue.
    <br>We would like to use this time to salute our governor of Lagos State, Gov Sanwo-Olu.
    <br>Indeed, he's one of a kind.
    <br>If you look at his activity at this critical time, it can be compared to the New York governor
    <br>who is always on the national news, day and night, to update the general public and to educate them.
    <br>Our governor wants to see his people and he wants to see them living well.
    <br>We pray God will increase his capacity to do more, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Prophet, thank you very much for this wonderful message.
    <br>Thank You Jesus for this wonderful time.
    <br>Viewers, thank you very much for your time.
    <br>Time with Jesus is time with joy, comfort and peace.
    <br>It's a time well spent!
