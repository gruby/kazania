    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There is a woman - you have beads.
    <br>Beads and it is not just for fashion.
    <br>If it's for fashion that would not be an issue to call you out.
    <br>These beads are not for fashion. Please come out.
    <br>It has nearly turned you into a dog.
    <br>You put on beads. Please come out.
    <br>It caused various issues with you.
    <br>These are beads. Please, come out.
    <br>Thank you. God loves you.
    <br>My name is Adebayo Jenrola. I'm from Ogun State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am the one the man of God prophesied to that has beads on.
    <br>Although I bought the beads, ever since I put them on I have not been myself.
    <br>YOU NEARLY TURNED INTO A DOG!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>Since then, I have had the spirit of lust. I have been following men.
    <br>I am not concentrating on my studies.
    <br>But to the glory of the Lord, the man of God prophesied to me and I confirm the prophecy.
    <br>Please deliver me, Man of God.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Adebayo Jenrola. I am from Ogun State, Nigeria.
    <br>Beside me is my mom, Mrs Adebayo.
    <br>I just want to thank God for everything He has done for me.
    <br>Last week was one of the most memorable days of my life.
    <br>I was so happy last week because I received a prophecy from the man of God.
    <br>He said, "There is a lady wearing different kinds of beads and the beads have nearly turned you into a dog".
    <br>He further said that the beads were not ordinary beads.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true,
    <br>because ever since I put on these beads
    <br>I have had different types of spirits - strange spirits, spirits that I could not even understand myself.
    <br>Here are the beads.
    <br>As you can see, these are the beads.
    <br>Ever since I have worn these beads,
    <br>I have had a spirit of lust and I have had an urge to meet men.
    <br>Sometimes I intentionally brought the beads out so that the men could see them,
    <br>or I would wear clothes that revealed the beads.
    <br>Whenever they saw the beads, they came for me.
    <br>Even if they did not come for me, the beads attracted them to me.
    <br>After I met them, they would get different kinds of sicknesses,
    <br>they would have issues with their businesses, the way they were living or their health.
    <br>They would call me and tell me that they did not know what was wrong with them -
    <br>either they were sick or they were not feeling fine; something was wrong with them.
    <br>I would tell them that I did not know anything about it,
    <br>but I knew that it was the evil spirit in me that had given it to them.
    <br>This spirit continued torturing me.
    <br>I saw people bow down to me in my dreams.
    <br>I saw myself in the middle of the water while people were worshipping me.
    <br>In the dreams I always enjoyed the fact that people bowed down to me.
    <br>In the physical realm, I had a spirit of anger - I got angry very quickly.
    <br>If someone made me angry, I would not respond to them, but something bad would happen to them.
    <br>While I was angry, if I did not put my legs into water I would not be fine.
    <br>So, sometimes I would sit in the middle of the river and when I felt better I would come out.
    <br>While I slept, the evil spirit would wake me up and tell me to get up.
    <br>I would get dressed and go out in the middle of the night, irrespective of how late it was -
    <br>midnight, one, two, three o''clock - I would then go out.
    <br>When I went out, I would find myself at a T-junction, and then I would sit down.
    <br>The strange thing was that people brought sacrifices to me.
    <br>I told them where to put the sacrifices, and told them not to touch me.
    <br>But when I touched them, they would not feel it, and no one saw me while I was at the T-junction.
    <br>However, when I left the T-junction, I would become visible again,
    <br>and people would ask me where I was going and where I was coming from in the middle of the night.
    <br>Nobody dared to challenge me after that, because if I was angry, something would happen to the person.
    <br>People would just talk to me. Nobody would dare touch me or do anything to me when I got back to my room.
    <br>For a very long period of time I did not go home. I was always at school.
    <br>I called my parents to let them know that I was fine and that they should not worry about me.
    <br>I asked them to send the school fees and my feeding allowance to me.
    <br>Sometimes I would not talk to my mom; actually, for a very long time now I have not spoken to her.
    <br>She would call me and I would not take her call or I would tell her to leave me alone.
    <br>I said that she could not choose for me or tell me what to do.
    <br>Whenever she tried to advise me, I would tell her not to disturb me and I even blocked her number.
    <br>I don't smoke or drink.
    <br>The moment I put on the beads everyone else became insignificant, even if they were naked.
    <br>I would be the only one they would see; they would only see me in the midst of everybody.
    <br>You mean, men would be attracted to you even if you were in the midst of different women?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- They would be attracted to you alone?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>A week ago I called my dad and told him I was coming home, because the spirit told me to go home.
    <br>Even in a dream, a woman told me, "Go home, my daughter. Go and see your mother".
    <br>When I woke up, I realised that I was not really interested in seeing my mother, but I wanted to see my sisters at home.
    <br>When I got home, I was worried that my mom would tell me to go back to where I came from,
    <br>or she would ask me what I was doing at home.
    <br>I expected her to insult me.
    <br>I had decided that if she did, I would not respond because I was a very secretive person.
    <br>No one would know anything about me unless I said something.
    <br>Even if people asked me something, I would lie to cover up other lies.
    <br>So, when she came back from work she said, "You are back?". I said, "Yes, I am back".
    <br>She said, "Okay".
    <br>I got home on Saturday and on the Sunday she said, "You need to come to The SCOAN".
    <br>I said, "Why? I am tired. I don't want to be delayed. I don't want to wake up early and have to rush up and down".
    <br>I was just giving her excuses.
    <br>She said, "You need to come to church if you don't want me to disown you".
    <br>I then said, "Okay. I will come".
    <br>That Sunday, during the mass prayer, the man of God gave a prophecy that
    <br>there is a lady putting on beads, and that the beads are not fashion beads.
    <br>Although I bought the beads, ever since I put them on I have not been myself.
    <br>I was very surprised because it was not the first time that I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>I did not expect anything to happen.
    <br>I thought that I would pray and go back home.
    <br>But I was very surprised when the man of God said that there was a lady putting on different types of beads.
    <br>That is how I found myself here at The SCOAN.
    <br>I have a very particular way of sleeping.
    <br>I don't sleep 'straight', I don't put my head up and sleep.
    <br>I have to cross my legs while I sleep.
    <br>And while I sleep, I don't move or shake.
    <br>I just sleep and when I wake up I feel there is something new about me.
    <br>But ever since the deliverance and the prophecy, I eat, I drink, I sleep well
    <br>and I don't have to sleep with my legs crossed anymore.
    <br>YOU NEARLY TURNED INTO A DOG!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>I have not had those dreams again and I haven't seen myself in the midst of anyone.
    <br>I just sleep and don't even remember my dreams.
    <br>I just sleep and wake up in the morning. I thank God.
    <br>YOU NEARLY TURNED INTO A DOG!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to tell everyone that I have really offended my mom.
    <br>I have never treated her like a mother.
    <br>Mom, I am sorry. Please forgive me.
    <br>To God be the glory. We thank God for this reconciliation.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Adebayo.
    <br>I really thank God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>I thank God. Concerning her behaviours, God really took control.
    <br>Because since this thing had been happening,
    <br>I said, "God, I want You to intervene. I want You to do this because I don't have anybody else; it is only You".
    <br>Before the prophecy and deliverance, so many things happened in her life.
    <br>When I tried to call her at school, she did not take my call.
    <br>She did not respect me.
    <br>Even though I spoke to her, at times she would be hostile towards me.
    <br>When she saw that I was calling her, she would not take the call.
    <br>She didn't do anything.
    <br>She just stayed away from us at home.
    <br>One day I called her and said, "Ola, what is happening?".
    <br>And another thing was that she was extremely secretive.
    <br>For example, if she held something in her hands and I asked her about it,
    <br>she would tell me, "Mommy, it is another thing".
    <br>For somebody that you have not been seeing, that you have been calling and she does not answer your call,
    <br>how do you want to know something about her?
    <br>She was extremely rude and aggressive.
    <br>She did not talk to anybody.
    <br>At times she came to Lagos and I found out about it from someone who saw her.
    <br>I would tell the person that she told me that she was coming,
    <br>but I was lying as I didn't know what to say.
    <br>I kept praying to God saying, "God, I want You to intervene concerning this girl,
    <br>concerning my family, because I know You are the only One who can do it".
    <br>After the deliverance and prophecy from the man of God, I have seen changes in her.
    <br>Everything is okay.
    <br>She calls me now, and I have noticed so many things about her,
    <br>because she is very fashionable.
    <br>Previously she would put on everything, but now everything is 'reduced'. She is calm now.
    <br>Now she reads her Bible, whereas in the past she didn't read her Bible.
    <br>The one day I told her to come to church and she disagreed with me.
    <br>But now, since her deliverance and prophecy from the man of God,
    <br>she has told me, "Mommy, I don't want to go back. I want to stay in the church. This is my home".  I agree with her.
    <br>To God be the glory. Put your hands together beautifully for Jesus.
    <br>The advice I have for parents listening to me, especially mothers:
    <br>Mothers, we have a lot of work to do concerning our children.
    <br>I mean, we must not leave them alone.
    <br>Even if they are doing something that is very bad to us, we must continue to pray for them,
    <br>because they need our prayers.
    <br>Continue to monitor them. Know what is happening to them.
    <br>Keep on praying for them.
    <br>Put everything in God's hands and I know He will assist us.
    <br>Thank you very much for that wonderful advice.
    <br>The advice I have for the youth like me is:
    <br>be careful what you do -
    <br>there are some material things which are good and there are some material things which are bad.
    <br>Just keep your focus on what you decide to pursue. If it is your studies, focus on it.
    <br>If you want to work, focus on it.
    <br>Don't let any material things distract you.
    <br>YOU NEARLY TURNED INTO A DOG!!!
