  <p>    
    <br>I have a message for my country and I want you to pray with me.
    <br>After the message, you join me in prayer.
    <br>This is three times I'm having this message.
    <br>Now I want to say it, it is the third time.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The president's heart is like a stream of water in the hands of God.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The president's, leader's heart is like a stream of water in the hands of God
    <br>and He can control it wherever He wants.
    <br>The first time I had the dream, I prayed and fasted on my own.
    <br>the second time again, I prayed and fasted,
    <br>But this third time, you must join me in prayer.
    <br>First, second, third.
    <br>When something is like that, you can imagine what - something strange.
    <br>So, you must join me in prayer because two believers are better than one.
    <br>For some time after my message to the nation that I am seeing us in the valley,
    <br>and our future is crying for help, since that time I keep to myself.
    <br>I should not go beyond God; I should go before Him.
    <br>The Lord said to me that I should tell the nation and leaders
    <br>to pray against the interruption of the democratic practice.
    <br>Pray against the interruption of democratic practice.
    <br>You have to join me in prayer for the nation.
    <br>The Lord gave me the prayers to offer as well
    <br>because in this case, there must be prayers given to you.
    <br>What are the prayers?
    <br>1. The Lord should give our leaders greater understanding of God's heart.
    <br>2. The Lord should give them the understanding and discretion to guide their hearts.
    <br>3. Give them understanding that will protect them and wisdom that will rescue them.
    <br>These are the prayers. Lift up your voice,
    <br>Lord Jesus, give them greater understanding of God's heart. Prayer!
    <br>Greater understanding of God's heart!
    <br>Discretion to guide their hearts! Prayer!
    <br>Understanding to protect them!
    <br>Wisdom and understanding to rescue them!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen]!
    <br>Thank you for joining me in prayer.
    <br>That is the voice of God.
    <br>The president's heart is like a stream of water in the hands of God
    <br>and He can control it wherever He wants.
    <br>Thank you. You may be seated
