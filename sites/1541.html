  <p>    
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance in Jesus' name to the people one by one,
    <br>the chain satan has used to connect them to himself is broken and they are delivered.
    <br>Who can justly do it? None other than our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>Along the line he encounters this woman.
    <br>You are who?
    <br>Python.
    <br>Spirit of death.
    <br>Spiritual husband.
    <br>What have you done to her marriage, her career?
    <br>No marriage - I destroyed the marriage.
    <br>I entered her husband to throw her out of the house.
    <br>Two kids.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>Through dream.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Betty Jonathan from Bayelsa State.
    <br>This is my husband and the next is my brother-in-law.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of spiritual husband and anger.
    <br>It all started when I was a child, when both of my parents left each other, I went to live with my aunt.
    <br>She started maltreating me, she treated me bad, beat me up and I was the one doing all the house work.
    <br>So she was using me for slavery.
    <br>My husband saw me and felt pity on me and then he took me to his house to live with him as a wife.
    <br>Immediately I moved in with him, I started seeing him as the enemy,
    <br>everything about him irritated me.
    <br>I was always angry at him and always fought him.
    <br>Sometimes when I was angry, I would break bottles, carry knives to stab and kill him.
    <br>He got tired and threw me out of the house.
    <br>When he threw me out of the house, after some time I went back,
    <br>abandoned my kids at the gate and left the place.
    <br>After some years, he said the only thing that would make him accept me back as a wife
    <br>if only I came down to this place and got myself delivered.
    <br>That was the only way he would accept me back as a wife. 
    <br>That was how I came down to this place last two weeks.
    <br>Ok, so that was why and how you came to The SCOAN and the Spirit of God located you, right?
    <br>Yes, sir. Last two weeks when I came, when the man of God was laying hands,
    <br>he laid his hands on my head and then I manifested.
    <br>After I manifested, he delivered me and that was how I got my deliverance.
    <br>Ok, you said earlier on that before your husband met you, you were living with a relation of yours,
    <br>and you were being maltreated; so that was how your husband met you
    <br>took you out of that place, right?
    <br>And since you started staying with him, things were better. Is that not it?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>So, how come you now saw yourself fighting the same man that took you out of that suffering,
    <br>breaking bottles and carrying knife to stab him?
    <br>Why did you now find yourself doing that?
    <br>I don't know. Just that I couldn't control myself whenever the anger entered me, the spirit entered me.
    <br>Sometimes I destroyed things in the house
    <br>and there was a day, I was really angry fighting him when I wanted to stone him
    <br>when I carried a torch from the ground and threw it.
    <br>The thing hit his eyes and he started bleeding from his eyes.
    <br>Mrs Betty Jonathan & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So it means that evil spirit has so much used you to torment this man.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Ok, do you have any children for him?
    <br>Yes, we have two kids.
    <br>So what happened with the children when all this problem was on?
    <br>I abandoned the kids. Since I abandoned the kids, I have not seen them for a year plus now.
    <br>You abandoned the kids with your husband?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And since over a year now you have not seen them?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You have listened to the woman, how that evil spirit, the spirit of python
    <br>has tormented her to the extent that she would fight the husband at every slightest provocation,
    <br>she would break bottles to stab the husband
    <br>or carry a knife to stab the husband.
    <br>And she said she also injured the husband on several occasions when she fought the husband
    <br>to the extent that the spirit even made her to abandon her two children
    <br>with the husband, for over a year now she has not seen those children.
    <br>Ok, tell us what now happened last Sunday when the man of God touched you. What happened to you?
    <br>I don't really remember what happened but
    <br>I only saw the man of God when he was laying hands on people and when he got to my place,
    <br>then I don't know what happened again.
    <br>Ok, now tell us, since after your deliverance, how do you feel? What are the changes you have noticed?
    <br>I'm very fine now, those spirits left me.
    <br>No anger now. Before, I no longer saw my husband as the man of the house
    <br>but now I do respect him and cherish him so much.
    <br>My name is Jonathan. I am from Bayelsa State.
    <br>You have listened to your wife. Can you please tell us how all this started and
    <br>what has been your experience since you met your wife.
    <br>I met her through my elder brother that is here.
    <br>Where she was staying, her aunt was really maltreating her.
    <br>When I saw the way she was suffering, I told her I would take her away from that suffering,
    <br>pay for her accommodation and furnish it. I would make life good for her
    <br>so that maybe I could get married to her one day.
    <br>So what do you mean by suffering? In what condition was she when you met her?
    <br>What did you find her doing and how was her outlook and others?
    <br>She would cook from morning till night, wash clothes from morning till night.
    <br>So many many things, I can't count them. They are so many.
    <br>I felt pity for her.
    <br>So what then happened?
    <br>When she accepted it, I took her, paid for her accommodation and furnished it for her.
    <br>From there, we got settled down and got married.
    <br>She was very good. She was like an ice block, ice water.
    <br>She couldn't even harm anything.
    <br>After she got pregnant with my first daughter, this problem started.
    <br>She would become so angry for no good reason.
    <br>She would be fighting me. I would be begging her.
    <br>It got to a point where my people got so tired. They said they would throw her out.
    <br>Yes, I became so tired too.
    <br>I warned her, I told her.
    <br>She said no, she cannot stop this kind of life.
    <br>I said, ok if it is that, I will throw you out.
    <br>I threw her out, with my kids.
    <br>However, I paid for her accommodation when I threw her out.
    <br>After some time, she came back again begging that I should give her a second chance.
    <br>I gave her another chance. That was when we had this last baby boy.
    <br>After one year,  the same problem started again; in fact this time, it became so worst.
    <br>I couldn't control myself again; I threw her out with the kids.
    <br>When I threw her out, I paid for her accommodation again, because of my kids.
    <br>I was sending them feeding money all the time.
    <br>Then a day she called me that she needed money to take care of the kids
    <br>and some two weeks ago I gave her a huge amount of money for her business
    <br>because I saw that we could not get married again and I didn't want my kids to suffer
    <br>so I gave her some amount of money
    <br>and I told her if I don't have money to send to you, you can use that money.
    <br>When I have money, I will replace it.
    <br>She said she has no money, that she wants to give me my kids back.
    <br>I said, ok fine, bring my kids back to me.
    <br>One night she just called me that she was there with my kids in front of my gate, at the front of my compound.
    <br>I said wow. I now sent one of the boys that was staying with me to go and...
    <br>I did not even see her face, she only called me on the phone that my kids were there.
    <br>I said ok. From that night I called my elder sister, look at what has happened.
    <br>My elder sister said, ok, I should sleep with the kids that night.
    <br>The following morning I should bring the two kids to her, where she is staying.
    <br>That was how I and her finally got separated.
    <br>After some months, she started begging that she wanted to come back.
    <br>I told, no, you will not come back to my house again
    <br>until you have been delivered from all these things.
    <br>Then maybe I will give you another chance.
    <br>There was a day she called me, she wanted to come to Lagos to this church here.
    <br>She had no money but because I wanted her to be delivered, that day I gave her money.
    <br>After some Sundays, she called me.
    <br>When I received the call from her, it was a different tune.
    <br>I was just laughing at her, she started smiling that she has been delivered.
    <br>I just cut the call, I did not say a word.
    <br>Until the day the man of God called me that I should come to The SCOAN
    <br>because I believed that if I did not witness these things, I would not... because I have suffered a lot.
    <br>I have spent so much money to make sure she is delivered but to no avail.
    <br>So I said, ok, I will come down.
    <br>I told my elder brother because he was a witness to all those things then.
    <br>So we now came down to this place.
    <br>Since then I have not watched - this is my first time of seeing this video.
    <br>Because whenever she called me, that, maybe, why don't you want to watch the video,
    <br>I would not even answer her because I believed if I came to this place, I would see the replay of that video.
    <br>This is my first time of seeing this video.
    <br>Well, I have no choice. If the man of God says I should take her home, who am I?
    <br>I will take her home and get married to her again.
    <br>Mrs Betty Jonathan & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>In other words, you just want to hear the voice of God, God's opinion.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You said that she abandoned the kids with you all this while.
    <br>Where have those kids been and where are they now?
    <br>When I came to this church last Sunday, he told me I should go back home again and bring my kids
    <br>and my elder sister since from then, they have been staying with my elder sister.
    <br>So you mean the kids are here now?
    <br>Yes, with my elder sister.
    <br>- Your elder sister?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Ok, can we have them come forward.
    <br>Madam, please come forward with the children - lovely children as you can see.
    <br>Mrs Betty Jonathan & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Madam, who are these children?
    <br>They are my kids.
    <br>So since that time you abandoned them, you are just seeing them now.
    <br>Yes, for a year plus now I have not seen them.
    <br>So now seeing them again, how do you feel as a mother who abandoned them since?
    <br>I am so happy and excited.
    <br>Mrs Betty Jonathan & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Well, you have heard it from her.
    <br>Mrs Betty Jonathan & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The children are also seeing their mother, since over a year now she abandoned them with her husband.
    <br>We saw you kneeling down beside your husband. What were you trying to express?
    <br>I'm trying to beg him to forgive me that I'm now a changed person.
    <br>I'm willing to submit as a wife.
    <br>Mrs Betty Jonathan & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>As you can see, this is a lesson for everyone of us to learn from
    <br>because there are many who are like this out there and they need to be delivered,
    <br>just like our sister here has been delivered.
    <br>The man of God makes us to understand that our sister has really embarrassed the man of God
    <br>with her behaviour and her character
    <br>and she has also embarrassed every woman sitting down here
    <br>who would never wish to treat their husband the way she has treated her husband.
    <br>Looking at the children, for over a year she had abandoned them and never bothered to know
    <br>how the children had been faring and she is looking flashy as you can see.
    <br>But today we thank God that God Almighty has intervened, the right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>So we need to know the mind of God in this situation
    <br>and by the time the anointed man of God comes out into our midst,
    <br>through him we shall know God's opinion and the mind of God concerning this marriage.
    <br>This is beyond human comprehension.
    <br>No man would be able to take what the husband has gone through all this while.
    <br>But we believe that by the time God Almighty intervenes,
    <br>we shall know the mind of God and know what next to follow.
    <br>After sharing their experiences, Prophet T.B. Joshua addressed
    <br>the case of Mr and Mrs Jonathan in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Let us hear God's opinion through him.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Well, before we proceed, I saw the whole thing
    <br>and I want to salute my brother.
    <br>This the position of man, we have to endure until we hear from Jesus
    <br>and that endurance, I salute him.
    <br>After the meeting, after the service today, I want to meet my brother,
    <br>giving him counsel concerning what happened.
    <br>What wonderful children we have seen today -
    <br>can you imagine somebody could abandon if not the evil spirit - abandon the whole things, for what?
    <br>Thank you, my brother.
    <br>Thank you very much. After the meeting today, I want to meet your family.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I want to meet them. They will come back for testimony.
    <br>I will not be able to say anything now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you, they will come back. You see your spectacles, see your dress,
    <br>see your children - they are somewhere, you abandoned them.
    <br>So, thank you.
