  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, brethren!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am Nosakhare Ogiebor Okunbor.
    <br>I am a businessman and a politician.
    <br>I am a Nigerian based in Benin.
    <br>The person by my side is my younger brother.
    <br>I am an independent marketer of liquefied petroleum gas,
    <br>popularly called cooking gas.
    <br>It all happened on the 20th of February this year.
    <br>I hired a truck.
    <br>It was loaded with 35 thousand litres of LPG, cooking gas - that is 20 metric tons.
    <br>The truck left Lagos for Benin and arrived in Benin at about 10pm.
    <br>They called me and said that the truck must be discharged that night.
    <br>I said it was not possible to discharge the LPG that night.
    <br>Moreover, my workers and the technical officers had all gone home;
    <br>that it will be discharged in the morning.
    <br>Let me explain this: at one o'clock in the morning one of my trucks had went to Enugu
    <br>for upgrade of the safety valve - it almost got burnt on its way to Benin.
    <br>The driver called me at about six minutes after one o'clock
    <br>to say that my truck caught fire, that they were able to put it down.
    <br>Five hours later at about six o'clock, when I woke up,
    <br>I called one of my managers, "Where are you?"
    <br>He said he was at the gate of my gas plant.
    <br>I said, "Please, if you are discharging be very careful,
    <br>considering what happened about five hours ago."
    <br>I left my apartment, I came out.
    <br>Within 10 minutes I received a call, distress call, "Gas everywhere!"
    <br>I said, "What is happening?"
    <br>Before I knew what was happening, the call went off.
    <br>Another one came again, "Gas!" This time they said, "Fire!"
    <br>I said, "My God!"; I screamed. My wife, my children, everybody came out.
    <br>I ran into my bedroom, collected my Morning Water and came out.
    <br>I faced the direction of my gas plant.
    <br>I said, "Son of God, manifest Yourself and destroy the work of the devil."
    <br>My children ran...
    <br>So right there in your house you ministered the Morning Water in the direction of your gas plant.
    <br>I ministered the Morning Water towards the direction of my gas plant.
    <br>Then my children came out, ran into one vehicle.
    <br>May God be praised, may His Name be blessed!
    <br>My daughter's marriage introduction was to be the next day; that is on the 21st.
    <br>My birthday was on the 22nd.
    <br>And this thing happened on the 20th.
    <br>So we ran into the vehicle, two of us went towards the fire brigade,
    <br>and I went in the direction of my gas plant,
    <br>which is about some kilometres away from my house.
    <br>When I got to the UniBank gate - those people who know Benin very well -
    <br>when I got to the UniBank gate, I called some of my workers,
    <br>and they said that no fire shed but the whole area was charged with gas.
    <br>Nosakhare Ogiebor Okunbor
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>I ran down and on getting to the place, vehicles were still passing;
    <br>even in the thick of gas, vehicles were still passing
    <br>which is dangerous - LPG is highly flammable.
    <br>So we tried to stop vehicles. It's a very busy road - Benin-Lagos express way.
    <br>We succeeded in stopping the vehicles
    <br>before police, road safety, soldiers from the supply and transport division -
    <br>it is about three kilometres away from a plant.
    <br>They came and helped us to stop the vehicles.
    <br>No vehicles this time. We were moving.
    <br>Sorry, sir, when you arrived at the gas plant,
    <br>can you describe the scene that you saw? What did you see at that point?
    <br>Praise Master Jesus!
    <br>The place was charged!
    <br>Here on the board...
    <br>I took this picture after about two hours
    <br>From this electric pole to the last fence, It is about 500 feet from the Benin-Lagos express way.
    <br>The whole compound was charged with gas.
    <br>What you are seeing here is not snow. This is gas, cooking gas.
    <br>So the roads - they were all charged.
    <br>And when the gas escaped - because the vapor goes further than the gas itself
    <br>and the vapor is the most dangerous; it can pick fire from anywhere.
    <br>But  nothing happened!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now, sir, we know that you are working in this industry
    <br>but for the benefit of those of us present here and viewers all over the world,
    <br>we want to understand the seriousness of this situation.
    <br>If not for divine intervention,
    <br>if such a situation occurred, what would have happened?
    <br>If not for the God of T.B. Joshua - the disaster is unimaginable.
    <br>A 5 kg cylinder can bring down a building, talkless of 35 000 liters.
    <br>That is 20 metric tons - that is worse than a bomb.
    <br>It can ... the whole area. What happened anywhere would have been a child's play.
    <br>It would have been more than about three hundred people that would have died that morning
    <br>because close by, we have a school and houses around that area.
    <br>Millions of naira - if not billions - would have been lost.
    <br>Within my compound, within my gas plant, I have about three new trucks.
    <br>The gas tank is covered, so that can take three hundred thousand liters.
    <br>That is about 169 metric tons.
    <br>Wow! So what you're trying to say, sir, is that in any other situation
    <br>any little thing would have sparked a fire in that situation
    <br>which would have led to hundreds of lives being lost
    <br>and property worth billions being destroyed.
    <br>You're right. Even a shoe nail can spark fire and that would be the end of the investment
    <br>and so many people would have been killed and houses burnt down.
    <br>Wow, people of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>This is indeed a mother of miracles.
    <br>And, sir, in your testimony you referenced a similar incident that happened.
    <br>I mean just for people to understand how serious this was -
    <br>what actually happened in that case compared to
    <br>what would have happened in your own?
    <br>My explanation is that I am an Emmanuel TV partner.
    <br>Every morning I use the Morning Water in my company.
    <br>Everywhere I have the sticker, every spiritual material from this great church,
    <br>The Synagogue Church Of All Nations - I have it all around my compound!
    <br>It is the handwork of God Almighty.
    <br>If not, the story would have been different.
    <br>Nothing, no single pin got burnt in my plant.
    <br>The only thing lost was the liquid.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And what you're saying, sir, is similar incidents
    <br>that happened in the past with other companies or gas plants -
    <br>not even to the volume of the gas that actually escaped in your own case -
    <br>what will happen in those cases?
    <br>A certain newspaper report said that more than hundred people died.
    <br>It was not even up to the leakage from that place,
    <br>it was not up to thirty percent of what happened in my plant.
    <br>Wowl, so we can really see what Jesus Christ has done in the life of our father here
    <br>through ministering the Morning Water, how God rescued the lives of hundreds,
    <br>and what would have been such a serious explosion that would have happened
    <br>as a result of this gas leakage.
    <br>Sir, can you just explain the other pictures that we're seeing on the board here,
    <br>apart from the one you explained earlier.
    <br>This is the hired truck. This is the discharge hose.
    <br>When you want to discharge, you tie a flexible hose to the truck
    <br>and tie the other end to the tank.
    <br>When the driver of this hired truck tied off the flange, he used just two nuts.
    <br>You can see from this place - just small.
    <br>He is supposed to use a long one but he didn't.
    <br>As he opened the valve, because of the pressure, one of the nuts gave way.
    <br>And this is the curb - you can see it from here where one of the nuts gave way.
    <br>This is the opening valve.
    <br>This is where the gas escaped from.
    <br>This is the truck that brought the gas to my plant.
    <br>I took the picture from a distance - what you are seeing here is not snow but LPG, cooking gas.
    <br>This is another picture.
    <br>These are houses around, the place is now fully developed.
    <br>These are houses around my company.
    <br>Wow, one more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We can only imagine the destruction that would have occurred, if not for God's divine intervention
    <br>and we thank God for this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Sir, in the light of what Jesus Christ has done -
    <br>what is your advice to viewers all over the world?
    <br>My advice is: only believe!
    <br>It is stated in John 11 that - believe and you will see the glory of God.
    <br>I want to say too that the teaching of my mentor, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>came in to me, when this incident happened.
    <br>At the beginning of the year he said, "Don't take offence".
    <br>And several times he has dwelled on that issue.
    <br>This truck that brought this gas -  immediately it happened
    <br>and God saved me, washed me clean of all my iniquities and cast away my sins,
    <br>people were begging, calls from all over -
    <br>because I'm the deputy national president of all LPG marketers.
    <br>Pressure was coming that the truck - they would pay,
    <br>they would pay half, they were making different propositions.
    <br>Initially they said 20 to 30.
    <br>After about three days I said, "If God could forgive me and protect my property,
    <br>what millions of naira?"
    <br>I keyed into what the man of God preached
    <br>and what is stated in Matthew 18 about a king and a servant.
    <br>After three days I asked the truck driver to go without paying anything.
    <br>I allowed him to go.
    <br>I had made a proposal to the company that they would pay me about fifty percent of the money;
    <br>I asked them to forget about it.
    <br>God Almighty saved me, saved my company,
    <br>for that reason I have to equally forgive others too.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God, and finally, sir, just give us a word of advice
    <br>about this Morning Water that you are holding and the Good Morning sticker -
    <br>the instruments that God really used in this situation.
    <br>What I have here - Morning Water, Good Morning Sticker -
    <br>in fact, any spiritual material from The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations
    <br>is an atomic bomb that destroys the work of satan.
    <br>Brethren, don't play with it. Always go with your Morning Water, your Good Morning Sticker.
    <br>When you are with it, you are secured, your life is protected,
    <br>blessing, breakthrough will be your portion, in Jesus name.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for this wonderful testimony,
    <br>the divine protection that this entire gas plant received -
    <br>not just our brother and his company but even all the surrounding neighborhood
    <br>that would have been affected seriously if this incident had resulted in a fire and explosion.
    <br>We give glory to God and right now we would like to hear a quick word from your brother as well,
    <br>who we believe was a witness to this miracle.
    <br>Sir, if you can just introduce yourself to us and just tell us,
    <br>what you can say on your own side about this incredible testimony
    <br>that your brother has just shared.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church! My name is Fred Ogiebor Okunbor.
    <br>He is my father and my brother.
    <br>On this day, 20th February, we were at home.
    <br>We don't live in the same house. So he gave us a call that the gas plant was on fire.
    <br>It was very, very bad news.
    <br>So we ran out, drove down there.
    <br>God being so good, almost getting there, the road was already blocked
    <br>because we live a little bit far from the gas plant.
    <br>We now walked down there,
    <br>only to get there to discover that the place was in a very messy situation.
    <br>God being so good, there was no fire. It would have been a different ball game entirely.
    <br>Lives!
    <br>It wasn't the property, the company - it was ok.
    <br>But the community would have been raised down, it would be totally raised down.
    <br>I've never seen a miracle like that.
    <br>Sometimes, when I hear about miracles, I just say, "It's a normal thing.
    <br>God has created us, He will do this thing for us."
    <br>But when I saw this thing, when I saw the gas - it was a big thing.
    <br>My God, you need to see it and you need to see the real work of God -
    <br>not the one we talk about because you need to experience the work of God
    <br>before you know that God exists.
    <br>And your brother was saying that the slightest thing could have caused the fire to spark.
    <br>A nail under your shoe sole - some people walking and dragging their legs
    <br>could have sparked it and the place would have been raised down.
    <br>Or even somebody that was a smoker in the enviroment.
    <br>There was a smoker. If he was a lunatic, I don't know.
    <br>He saw people running helter skelter but he was still smoking.
    <br>And my immediate senior brother - he is not here today -
    <br>we ran to the neighboring houses to beg them not to use their stoves, to stop their cooking.
    <br>And there was a woman who was already cooking outside with the kids around.
    <br>We begged her, we even used water to quench the fire and the pot of soup.
    <br>So it was very miraculous. God is good, God is too good.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So we can understand what our brother is saying -
    <br>even at that scene, someone was smoking outside, a woman was cooking -
    <br>and ordinarily that alone would have sparked the flammable gas
    <br>to have an explosion of fire that would have consumed the entire community.
    <br>But because of the Morning Water that had been ministered
    <br>and also the Morning Stickers that were in the entire environment -
    <br>that's how God secured that environment.
    <br>That even the person that smoked and the person that was cooking -  it did not start the fire.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>As a witness to this miracle, what is also your advice,
    <br>your encouragement to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>Just to hang on to God, just to keep very, very close to God.
    <br>My advice is: keep your Morning Water very close to you.
    <br>Have it in your pocket, have your Sticker around you
    <br>because in the company, like my daddy said earlier, we have the stickers all around  -
    <br>in the trucks, the private cars, everywhere.
    <br>God is really good and my advice is: get closer to God.
    <br>If you have not - get closer. The profit is just too big. Thank you.
    <br>Thank you, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus one more time!
