    <br>The viewers I know are aware that the prayer today will cover them until next Sunday.
    <br>What a mighty grace.
    <br>Each day you wake up and tune to Emmanuel TV, the prayer you receive is now -
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>tomorrow - now;
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>on Tuesday - now;
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Wednesday - now;
    <br>Thursday - now;
    <br>Friday - now;
    <br>Saturday - now.
    <br>That is the prayer we are offering now.
    <br>The grace is mighty.
    <br>We asked God and He released the grace.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, those under the influence of my voice,
    <br>it is time to combat demons and whatever situation you are in – setback, affliction;
    <br>it is time to combat demons and that situation with the Word.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Remember, the Word is the sword of the recreated spirit.
    <br>We walk by faith.
    <br>We require no evidence of the senses.
    <br>We have proof that the things which we are praying for have come.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>I will not come here to pray for you if I don’t know what I am going to pray for or what we are going to recieve.
    <br>Already, the things we are about to pray for have come – healing, blessing, victory, deliverance - they have come.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>What a God we serve.
    <br>I will not come out and begin to pray when I don’t know God's will, when I don't know God's intention,
    <br>when I don't know God's promise - that is in vain.
    <br>I know before coming to pray that what we are about to pray for, the things we are about to pray for have come.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Tell your neighbour viewers, the things we are about to pray for have come -
    <br>healing, deliverance, blessing, victory have come.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That is why I can come out and pray.
    <br>I pray according to His will.
    <br>All you need now is to use your faith to receive them.
    <br>Faith does not originate from you and it does not originate from me.
    <br>It did not even originate from the apostles.
    <br>Faith originates from God.
    <br>We have faith.
    <br>Our faith increases because God possesses a nature.
    <br>I want to pray for you.
    <br>Receive the faith which God is prepared to give.
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>This reminds me of what the demon-possessed boy's father said to Jesus,
    <br>"I believe, help my unbelief".
    <br>Receive the faith which God is prepared to give, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Receive the faith which God is prepared to give you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes, thank You, Lord.
    <br>Whatever wall between you and God, be removed in the name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>When there is a wall between you and God; how will you receive blessings?
    <br>He sent forth His Word and healed them.
    <br>He sent forth His Word and delivered them.
    <br>I command deliverance on you – be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen!)
    <br>Whatever wall, hindrance – wall could be your weakness, shortcoming, limitation, sin -
    <br>whatever wall between you and God, be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, begin to confess that hindrance between you and God.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, that wall, be removed!
    <br>that wall, be removed!
    <br>Yes - that wall, be removed.
    <br>That weakness, be removed.
    <br>That sin, be removed!
    <br>That limitation, be removed!
    <br>That wall, be removed, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The wall has been removed!
    <br>Let there be a relationship!

    <br>I hear someone say, " I sense the presence of God!"

    <br>I feel the presence of God.
    <br>I sense the presence of God.

    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Now, as you know Jesus’ name, be set on high!
    <br>As you know Jesus’ name, be delivered, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>Find fulfilment as you seek God!
    <br>Find fulfilment as you seek Him!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Viewers, are you on the sick bed?
    <br>Right now, dry bones shall rise again!
    <br>I speak healing to that pain!
    <br>Healing to that affliction!
    <br>Deliverance!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua 
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, be it on the sickbed, wherever it is located -
    <br>affliction in your bones, kidneys, liver, blood, muscles, tendons, fluids,
    <br>I speak deliverance, in the name of Jesus to your organs and faculties!
    <br>I command deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Healing, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You can begin to place your hand, wherever there is sickness, pain, affliction.
    <br>Begin to place your hand to help your faith.
    <br>You pain, affliction, don’t be stubborn!
    <br>Don’t be stubborn!
    <br>In the name of Jesus, don’t be stubborn!
    <br>Quit!
    <br>Wherever affliction is located in your organs -
    <br>affliction, don’t be stubborn!

    <br>You must quit – leave!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua

    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>I cover you with the blood of Jesus!
    <br>Be covered by the blood of Jesus!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
