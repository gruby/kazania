    <br>My advice to people around the world is that when a lady comes to you,
    <br>telling you that she has the spirit of this or that, please run away!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My God.
    <br>Start again!
    <br>My God.
    <br>What I want to tell people around the whole world,
    <br>be careful of married women - some of them are married women;
    <br>they are looking for a place to pull you down.
    <br>They would be telling you, "Man of God, I am passing through this thing;
    <br>my belly is aching; I am having chest pain in the breast."
    <br>All this, all that - please run away!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Pastor, take your time and say it again.
    <br>You said that we should be careful...
    <br>Viewers all over the whole world, be careful
    <br>because this is how I just started following young ladies and married women.
    <br>They would come and say, "Man of God, I have pain in my waist; touch it!
    <br>Touch it and pray for me.
    <br>Man of God, I have pain in my chest; touch it and pray for me.
    <br>Man of God, my belly!" - before you know what is going on, you are on the other side.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Man of God, touch my chest; I have pain in my chest" - then you would lay your hands.
    <br>Then they would say, "Man of God, touch my waist; I have pain in the waist" - then you would lay your hands.
    <br>"Man of God, touch my tummy" - before you know it, from the tummy you have gone down.

    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
