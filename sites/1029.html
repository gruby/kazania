  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, walking in the spirit, ministers prayer in the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>and every mountain in the lives of the people that are standing between them and God's promises
    <br>are removed in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Demons are the cause of the enormous growth of pain all over the world
    <br>but at the mention of that 
    <br>name Jesus Christ, they have to bow.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua moved along the line, he encountered this woman possessing a demon
    <br>and she began to react uncontrollably as the Holy Spirit's fire arrested her.
    <br>Lets watch.
    <br>I made her to become a prostitute.
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>Right now speaking, I am the marine spirit.
    <br>Who else is in this body?
    <br>I am the spiritual husband, spirit of anger, 
    <br>marine spirit and spirit of lust.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>I have destroyed her.
    <br>How?
    <br>I have made her to become a prostitute.
    <br>What have you done to her family?
    <br>We have made her family suffer so much.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>When she first went to America.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua commands the evil spirits out of her body in Jesus' name, and she is free.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Debra Kataro and the woman standing beside me is my mother.
    <br>I'm from Togo.
    <br>Five years back, we went to America from Togo.
    <br>When we got there, when I came out of the airport,
    <br>this kind of like a hot air hit my face.
    <br>Nobody else felt it, but I felt it;
    <br> I was 9 years old then.
    <br>We came out of the airport.
    <br>I grew up in America and I started going to school.
    <br>So as I moved to the higher class - sixth grade,
    <br>I had a friend who was doing prostitution - sleeping with men for money.
    <br>And then she asked me if I was ready to live the kind of life that she was living.
    <br>I didn't know anything so I said, "Yeah!"
    <br>So then I started doing it.
    <br>Also whilst I was growing up, in school I used to get angry really quick;
    <br>like if I didn't see blood, I wouldn't leave the person.
    <br>I had to see blood before I left the person alone.
    <br>The school found out and placed me 
    <br>in foster care.
    <br>If you're in foster care, it means 
    <br>that you're sleeping at an improper age,
    <br>and at that time I was like around 10 - 11 years old and I was sleeping with men for money,
    <br>prostituting with my friends for money.
    <br>Meanwhile, whilst I was doing this, my mum didn't know anything about it.
    <br>Only I and my friends knew about it in the school.
    <br>So what happened after your first meeting with your friend,
    <br>when she introduced you into prostitution?
    <br>I started doing it - I started doing the same thing she was doing.
    <br>The prostitution job that she was doing.
    <br>So how did you go about it?
    <br>How did she teach you to go about
    <br> doing prostitution at that young age?
    <br>She taught me how I was supposed
    <br>to dress if I wanted to attract men.
    <br>It was in school that she was teaching me everything.
    <br>Okay, and so once she taught you
    <br>how to dress and how to attract men,
    <br>where did you now go to practice
    <br>the prostitution that you had learned?}
    <br>Well, in the streets.
    <br>So how many men a day did this prostitution lead you to be sleeping with at that age?
    <br>Two, three, most four.
    <br>In school also, I fought.
    <br>I beat the teachers, the students, 
    <br>anybody that got me angry.
    <br>I would fight them.
    <br>And at home - it took
    <br> me away from my parents.
    <br>Those two years that I spent in foster care, I should have spent it with my mother and father,
    <br>and it just took me away from them.
    <br>Because of me, they deported 
    <br>my family from America back to Togo.
    <br>My mom is a diplomat and she went to work in America.
    <br>But because of me, they told all of us to go back to Africa.
    <br>And when we came back to Africa, I started doing the same thing which is prostituting,
    <br>going out at night, sleeping with men, drinking.
    <br>Sometimes, I would even sleep at my friend's house,
    <br>not even coming back home until the next morning.
    <br>My mother did not know anything about it
    <br>because when I came back home,
    <br>I would tell her I didn't do anything.
    <br>She would usually call me a prostitute,
    <br>and that would get me really angry.
    <br>One night, I came back home with shoes that my friends and I had bought.
    <br>I came back home with those shoes.
    <br>When I came home, they started calling me names,
    <br>and I said, "I'm going out, I'm leaving!"
    <br>I left and I came the next day at night,
    <br>at around 10 o'clock.
    <br>When I came back inside the house, my mother didn't call me right away.
    <br>But as I was watching TV, she called me and I went.
    <br>I wasn't really thinking that she was going to say anything bad to me.
    <br>So when I came out, she asked, 
    <br>"Where did you come from?"
    <br>I said, "I'm not telling you, why 
    <br>do you want to know?"
    <br>Then she asked me, "Those shoes that you bought, where did you get those shoes from?"
    <br>I said, "My friends and I went out and bought them.
    <br>We had just got some money,
    <br> and we went and bought it".
    <br>She said, "Your friends and you did not do anything like that.
    <br>You went to do prostitution and bought the shoes".
    <br>I said, "That's not what happened; you don't know".
    <br>And then she told me to go on my knees,
    <br>I said," I'm not going on my knees."
    <br>So then my grandmother came out and said
    <br>that she was going to take the shoes
    <br>away from me and cut them in pieces.
    <br>I said, "It's not going to happen" and I just took the shoes away from her.
    <br>I pushed her; she fell on the floor.
    <br>I said that she could stay there.
    <br>My mother started talking to me but I wasn't really minding her.
    <br>I was on one side and telling her, "See how your life is going; nothing is happening!"
    <br>And then she started saying 
    <br>things but I wasn't really minding her.
    <br>I went inside the room, I wanted to sleep.
    <br>We sleep in the same room.
    <br>And then she told me, "Get out of the room!"
    <br>I said, "I want to get something 
    <br>from the room, please".
    <br>She told me, "Get out!"
    <br>So as I was getting out, I put the shoes next to the door.
    <br>She threw my shoes outside the door.
    <br>I said, "What are you doing, you b****?"
    <br>So we can really see how this spirit of prostitution had destroyed her life
    <br>and affected her family.
    <br>Not least of all, her mother who was having a very important job in the United States,
    <br>the whole family had to be sent back to Togo because of this atmosphere,
    <br>and how she was affected among her relatives, even the grandmother.
    <br>So tell us - at that time, what was
    <br> happening to your spiritual life?
    <br>What kind of dreams were you having,
    <br>that continued to push you on 
    <br>from one point to the next?
    <br>Okay. In my dreams, I usually saw myself wearing a crown, like being a princess.
    <br>And a lady - there would be men
    <br> passing and the lady would actually come near me
    <br>and tell me, "This man, you have to go after him".
    <br>She showed me which man 
    <br>I was going to go after the next morning.
    <br>When I woke up in the morning, the people that I saw in my dreams
    <br>would be the people that I would actually see in real life like this, and they went after me.
    <br>And they would the people that you would then sleep with as you were practicing this prostitution
    <br>Yeah,
    <br>So tell us, how did you go about
    <br>it at that very young age?
    <br>How were you able to get these 
    <br>people?
    <br>What powers or what skills were you able to use in order to attract them?
    <br>I have beads that show that.
    <br>Okay, so what are these beads
    <br>we are seeing in your hands now?
    <br>The blue one - my friend gave it to me;
    <br>the one that did the same thing with me.
    <br>These three - I bought them myself.
    <br>Okay, so what is the function of
    <br>these beads? What were they doing?
    <br>Like when they saw this - sometimes,
    <br>I would dress inappropriately,
    <br>I would wear something short that came up to here.
    <br>Sometimes up to here, 
    <br>so that they would to be able to see it.
    <br>So when they saw it -
    <br>when I walked past you and you would see it, you would go after me.
    <br>You couldn't resist me, you had to go after me.
    <br>So basically this was what gave you the power of seduction to seduce the men
    <br>they showed you in the dream, in order to continue with that prostitution, is that right?
    <br>Yeah!
    <br>Even so with this power, that ability and the dreams you've been having,
    <br>as a young person at that time,
    <br>how were you able to go to the places where you would get the men
    <br>you had seen in the dream or that you would later entice with these powers?
    <br>My fake ID card.
    <br>Whilst we were in America, I had a fake ID card that said that I was 21 years old,
    <br>which allowed me to go out to clubs and have fun with my friends.
    <br>Meanwhile, I was not 21.
    <br>How old were you at at that time?
    <br>When I had it, I was around 12.
    <br>So our sister was around 12 years old and she had an ID card - a fake, a forged ID card -
    <br>that said she was 21 which allowed her access to go to all the nightclubs and different places
    <br>where she would go to practice prostitution to seduce and sleep with men.
    <br>If you go to my Facebook 
    <br>page, all you will see is men.
    <br>So many men - some would 
    <br>ask me where I lived.
    <br>Sometimes I would lie and say that I live at the same place where they were living,
    <br>give them fake appointments to
    <br>meet me at the restaurant.
    <br>I remember this Nigerian guy - he's on on my Facebook -
    <br>and he told me I should come to Nigeria and marry him.
    <br>So we understand that that was the next stage that this spirit pushed you to -
    <br>going onto the internet and different social media.
    <br>So what kind of men would you normally target or which ones wouldnormally choose you?
    <br>Grown-ups, married men.
    <br>Sometimes, when I slept with them, 
    <br>if there were successful in life,
    <br>everything that they had would be like broken.
    <br>There would be nothing. If they had 
    <br>money like really a lot of money.
    <br>in two days, there would be no more money.
    <br>So can you tell us any big experience or any specific occurrence
    <br>you really remember that,  "Ah! I know this has happened".
    <br>Well, one time I remember when I slept with this married man, he came to me the next day
    <br>and told me that I destroyed everything between him and his wife;
    <br>and said why I did that, why he slept with me in the first place,
    <br>why I go out for men. He started calling me names, and I really didn't mind it.
    <br>So basically that power within you had given you the ability to seduce and destroy men at this time,
    <br>that was what was happening?
    <br>Yeah.
    <br>Okay, so tell us now, what was it that now let to your coming to The SCOAN
    <br>where you received your deliverance 
    <br>from this demonic spirit?
    <br>At first I really did not like Emmanuel TV, the anointed sticker, the anointed water
    <br>because when I saw Emmanuel TV, it was like though I should break the TV.
    <br>When I saw the sticker, I couldn't stand the sticker.
    <br>I couldn't stay next to the sticker.
    <br>Sometimes my mother would tease 
    <br>me and put the anointing water on me
    <br>and I really didn't like that.
    <br>It did something to me when she did it. It got me so angry.
    <br>I couldn't stay next to you, when you had the anointing water, the sticker or watching the TV.
    <br>I couldn't stay next to you, 
    <br>I had to get away from you.
    <br>Wow! So how did that now lead you to come to The SCOAN where you received your deliverance?
    <br>We went someplace and 
    <br>they said that we should come here.
    <br>Meanwhile, I knew that we were coming here but then I told her I was not going anymore.
    <br>The night that we were
    <br>leaving, she told me that we were going.
    <br>And that's how I came here.
    <br>So tell us - at the prayer line, what was your experience when you were there
    <br>and the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you?
    <br>I was standing there, he was praying for people.
    <br>So when he was coming near to me, I was getting very angry.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me, it was as though I was sleeping on one side.
    <br>All I saw was like so many
    <br> people wearing black,
    <br>shouting that something was paining, itching, scratching them.
    <br>Meanwhile, when this light was cleansing -
    <br>the more the light cleansed, 
    <br>the more they shouted in pain.
    <br>When he touched me the second time, all those people that were wearing black disappeared
    <br>and another light was walking towards me.
    <br>Hallelujah, let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>Who else can justly rescue and deliver but our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>Since your deliverance, tell us how you are you feeling now and what the differences are.
    <br>I feel happy.
    <br>I'm glad that I'm delivered because I could have been dead by now, died with my sins.
    <br>I'm happy I did not die with my sins.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus once again!
    <br>So tell us how you have been sleeping and what your dreams are like since your deliverance.
    <br>Are you still seeing those men?
    <br>No!
    <br>Actually when I got my deliverance on that Sunday,
    <br>on Monday when I was sleeping, I saw all those people I used to see in my dreams.
    <br>They just picked up their luggage, started putting their clothes in it and left.
    <br>Ever since then, I haven't had 
    <br>those dreams, and I sleep like a baby.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And since then you have been 
    <br>in The SCOAN.
    <br>Tell us - are you still having the urge for men, the spirit of lust
    <br>or the desire to sleep with men for money?
    <br>No.
    <br>Okay, tell us how you feel.
    <br>I feel free. Now I don't feel like I have 
    <br>to wear these beads for men.
    <br>I feel like I have to grow up and get married before I do all those things and not at a young age.
    <br>I shouldn't be doing this because it's not proper.
    <br>Wow! Glory be to God! We can see what the Word of God has done in the life of our sister.
    <br>It is powerful and it has kept her pure.
    <br>We want to hear a word of advice from you.
    <br>Speak to people all over the world, especially young people like yourself
    <br>who find themselves in a similar bondage or problem that you had.
    <br>What can they do to get their way out?
    <br>They have to believe in Christ. Don't be with somebody you're not supposed to be with
    <br>and become something bad that connects satan's chain to yourself.
    <br>Just believe in Christ and 
    <br>everything will be well with you.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>What a wonderful word of advice!
    <br>My name is Arisoba Hodalo.
    <br>I'm from Togo.
    <br>Thank you very much, and share with us about the testimony your daughter has given so far today.
    <br>Tell us what life was like, living with her at that time
    <br>when she was possessed with this spirit of prostitution.
    <br>I work with our foreign minister, and they sent me five years ago
    <br>to the embassy of Togo at the United Nations, and I was the assistant to the ambassador.
    <br>So I went there with my whole family.
    <br>Few years ago, I saw my daughter's character changing.
    <br>One day when I came back from work, I saw her with three men.
    <br>I was so shocked; three men 
    <br>with condoms in my own bed.
    <br>And then, that is when I talked to her.
    <br>She changed; I couldn't bear her character.
    <br>She insulted me; she couldn't listen at school and at home.
    <br>In our street, everywhere -  nobody could bear her.
    <br>You couldn't stand in front of her.
    <br>This was when the two governments - the government of America and the Togolese government -
    <br>decided to send us back home.
    <br>Okay, they sent you back home because they were aware of this case,
    <br>they were aware of what was happening.
    <br>Yes, because one day she left and the government of America used their airplanes
    <br>and the police to look for her.
    <br>They couldn't bear her, they asked 
    <br>us to leave the United States.
    <br>So just to recap, for the benefit 
    <br>of our viewers all over the world,
    <br>you heard our mother introducing herself as a minister
    <br>that was sent on behalf of the government of Togo
    <br>to work in the embassy in the United States of America.
    <br>It was while she was there five years ago that she noticed changes coming over her daughter.
    <br>Her daughter became rude and argumentative, and no one could talk to her.
    <br>Until one day to her horror, when she came home,
    <br>she discovered her daughter in her bedroom with three men with condoms,
    <br>committing this act of prostitution.
    <br>That's when she really got to know that there was a serious problem on the way
    <br>and she later went on to say how this problem had affected her career
    <br>in that she was taken back from where she was sent on mission to the United States of America.
    <br>Her whole family was sent back to Togo, just because of this issue.
    <br>She told us how her daughter had gone missing,
    <br>to the extent that the government and the police had to intervene,
    <br>in order to help her find her daughter and bring her back home.
    <br>So after you came back to Togo from the United States of America,
    <br>did this attitude still continue? What was life like living with her?
    <br>Yes, she did the same thing.
    <br>One of my friends introduced me to Emmanuel TV and we used to watch it.
    <br>Okay, just before we get to Emmanuel TV, we once again want to hear from you.
    <br>What was the age of your daughter when you noticed these changes in America started taking place,
    <br>that she started misbehaving and going into prostitution?
    <br>Between 10 and 11.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Okay, so when you discovered Emmanuel TV,
    <br>and you started trying to get your daughter to watch it, what was her reaction like?
    <br>She used to say, "Oh! Mummy, you are wasting your time.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is a fake man, don't listen to him".
    <br>She always run away from the TV.
    <br>What was it that now encouraged you and made you believe that if you came here with your daughter,
    <br>she could receive her deliverance from this problem?
    <br>Because I believe God will never fail and when I used to watch Emmanuel TV, my faith grew.
    <br>And I knew that when I get here, she will be delivered.
    <br>Hallelujah, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So when you were with your daughter at the prayer line and you saw the man of God praying for her,
    <br>and indeed the deliverance you had been longing for was finally taking place,
    <br>how were you feeling?
    <br>I felt so happy and I cried of joy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>There are not enough natural words to say other than "Thank You, Lord, for this wonderful deliverance".
    <br>So tell us, before we hear about how she has changed after the prayer line,
    <br>what were some of the efforts you and your family had gone through
    <br>to get her delivered or free from this problem before you came here?
    <br>Actually, we just prayed; we didn't go anywhere.
    <br>Hallelujah. So since the deliverance at the prayer line through Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>tell us - what have been the changes and the differences you've noticed in the life of your daughter?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I thank God because when I saw her wearing this, she couldn't wear this before.
    <br>Even when she wanted to go to church, she would wear - I don't know.
    <br>I thank God, I don't have much to say,
    <br>I couldn't send her to do something
    <br> in the house,
    <br>She refused everything I asked her to do.
    <br>But after her deliverance, I sent her, and she went and did it with joy. I thank God!
    <br>Hallelujah. We can see she's a changed person. The evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Lastly, please give us your word of advice to people all over the world
    <br>who may be suffering from a similar problem that your family had in this instance.
    <br>My advice goes like this: To all the mothers, put your faith in God.
    <br>Nobody can help you, only God.
    <br>Love your children despite their characters.
    <br>Love them and try to talk to them.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Our mother is advising people all over the world that
    <br>the most important thing is their relationship with God.
    <br>Once you have established a firm relationship with God, the blessings, the miracles,
    <br>the protection and everything we need to live for him here and now
    <br>will continue to follow us and abide with us.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for 
    <br>this wonderful testimony and this deliverance.
    <br>And we encourage you to maintain it by making God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Let love lead you and lead you on to better, and the best is yet to come for you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
