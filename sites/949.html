    <br>Yes, I give warning; this is warning – a red card to the evil spirits right now.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>I say, "Out!"
    <br>You, evil spirit - leave my people!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>She is possessed with spirit of flirting and this spirit has been in the family.
    <br>It will be cast out.
    <br>She is like a dog.
    <br>Dog means, she is just flirting with any man.
    <br>Anytime the spirit comes upon her, she is just like a prostitute.
    <br>She is not going to a hotel but she is flirting around.
    <br>That is the problem she has.
    <br>Jesus loves her.
    <br>What you said is true.
    <br>I came here for freedom.
    <br>I have been praying to God so many times to set me free.
    <br>After the service, the woman who had received the prophecy met T.B. Joshua for her deliverance.
    <br>Here, the man of God ministers prayer and deliverance, with a touch, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>backed up, accompanied by all the power of heaven.
    <br>Her deliverance takes place and she is free.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Roberta and I'm coming from Spain.
    <br>First of all, I would like, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, to tell everything, to expose the devil
    <br>and say my testimony today.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Indeed, this testimony is to put shame to the devil for what he has done
    <br>and to glorify Jesus for His deliverance in your life.
    <br>Share with us what was the word of prophecy you received last week Sunday.
    <br>T.B. Joshua prophesied that I had the spirit of flirting and it comes from my family
    <br>and the spirit was putting me into the prostitution, but Jesus loves me and He took me out - He saved me.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Share with us your experience in life; how can you confirm this prophecy to be true?
    <br>My family was a disaster.
    <br>Everyone...
    <br>I didn't even experience what it means to have a family because everyone is divorced;
    <br>my aunts, my mother and father...
    <br>It was a disaster - I was suffering so much.
    <br>I was praying, "Lord..."
    <br>I remember - when I was little, I wasn't a Christian and I just said, "Me - I am not gonna live like that".
    <br>I was praying, "God, rescue me".
    <br>When I was about 18 years old, my mother used to say, "Oh, women in our family are very sexual. Don't worry -
    <br>it's fine. Go and flirt with the men. It's nothing bad"
    <br>I always had this temptation to talk to guys and get the things I wanted.
    <br>I never understood why...
    <br>Since I was very young, men used to look at me incredibly.
    <br>I never understood what was wrong with me.
    <br>Even when I was dressing up simply, without make-up, without anything, I used to get so much attention
    <br>that I couldn't handle it.
    <br>I didn't have a Spirit of God, at that time.
    <br>I remember, when I was about 18 years old, when I was going back home from the gym,
    <br>there was a man following me and when I entered my house
    <br>he grabbed me and touched my intimate parts.
    <br>He wanted to pull me out of the house.
    <br>But he didn't know that I lived in that neighbourhood and my mother opened the door, and she saw him -
    <br>then he dropped me on the floor and ran away.
    <br>So, God was saving me always from all kinds of situations.
    <br>While I was in serious relationships, I didn't understand why I was looking at the men,
    <br>why I had this feeling for the men, why I wanted...
    <br>I couldn't understand.
    <br>My heart didn't want that but my body, my flesh...
    <br>I was even scared to look at the guy, because when I looked at him, he was getting crazy.
    <br>When I go to the gym, I don't even want to look at anyone because I feel like men wait for my eye-contact.
    <br>Once I accepted Jesus Christ a year ago, the spiritual fight started because I started to feel so bad about it.
    <br>I knew I wasn't having sex with them but I felt so much guilt and disgust inside of me.
    <br>I was asking the Lord, "What's happening? Why do I feel this spiritual fight inside of me?"
    <br>What was in my head... and it's true...
    <br>In my mind I knew that If I wasn't a Christian, I would be going around with all the men and would have pleasure,
    <br>I wouldn't be able to finish that.
    <br>That was in my head.
    <br>That really scarred me.
    <br>I remember one time I came back home because I couldn't be in the church...
    <br>I thought, "I am a Christian, but I feel so dirty and bad".
    <br>I came back home and I was praying to the Lord - I said, "Take my life back to heaven and finish with me,
    <br>or deliver me, because I don't want to live like that."
    <br>So, we can really understand that this spirit of flirting, of a dog,
    <br>has really pushed you around and made your life miserable.
    <br>You mentioned earlier that when you went to a gym it was almost
    <br>as if men were waiting to have contact with your eyes.
    <br>What can you say?
    <br>Do you think there was a power in your eyes?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I will tell you one thing - it is for girls, listen to me.
    <br>I was a Christian already and I loved God - this is why I am here delivered now.
    <br>A month ago, when I went to the gym, the nice guys were saying to me, "You are so good, so nice".
    <br>You might think maybe he could be a Christian in the future, your husband or whatever.
    <br>I used to say, "I am a Christian. I can't meet with you."
    <br>When they start to talk with you and have more confidence, they would say,
    <br>"Oh, I would like to read the Bible with you. I would like to know about God. Maybe you could lead me to God?"
    <br>It is a lie!!
    <br>Even before my coming to The SCOAN, there was a man who...
    <br>Thanks God that I didn't sleep with him.
    <br>You know what he told me when I was going home?
    <br>He said, "From now on, you are going to think about me, and you will beg me to call you back,
    <br>and to have sex with me, and to finish what we started."
    <br>That is demon.
    <br>That is not a guy who wants to know the Bible, that's not a Christian and it is not from God!
    <br>Wow, we can really understand how these spirits...
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus
    <br>for rescuing our sister from what could have been a very terrible life indeed.
    <br>Tell us, what were some of the things, that this spirit of flirting has pushed you to do,
    <br>that now, being delivered you find yourself regretting.
    <br>You know, I regret...
    <br>How to say?
    <br>This spirit...
    <br>If I had died, I would have gone to hell.
    <br>That is what I regret most - that I...
    <br>I mean...
    <br>That was the thing: God saved my soul, He saved my spirit because if I had died, I would have gone to hell
    <br>God is holy and He hates sin.
    <br>That is what I regret: doing sin, not being delivered and not fighting with devil harder -
    <br>but it is difficult when you are not delivered.
    <br>OK. We understand.
    <br>Now, for the glory of God - you said you wanted to put devil to shame
    <br>for what he has used you to do in the past;
    <br>tell us some of those worst experiences you had with this spirit of flirting and dog.
    <br>What are the things you want to confess now, in the presence of God?
    <br>Guilt, disgust...
    <br>I had dreams of having sex with men.
    <br>I also had a dream where the man was saying to me, "You are not gonna achieve it. You are nothing.
    <br>You are disgusting. I will take you. You will not achieve what you want to."
    <br>They used to talk to me through the people, even Christians.
    <br>Can you imagine that they told me, "You gonna stay always like that. You will not change."?
    <br>That's how devil was manipulating me.
    <br>That was the worst experience to me.
    <br>Also, I thought that I would never get married because I could not settle.
    <br>I was with a person and I was thinking about doing something with other men.
    <br>I didn't want that but I couldn't deal with it.
    <br>It was just in my mind; it was making me crazy.
    <br>I had a depression.
    <br>I remember - for seven months I used to wake up, go to the bathroom and cry...
    <br>I couldn't even work.
    <br>So, you mean that even when you were in a serious relationship with someone,
    <br>this spirit of flirting would not stop.
    <br>It would still be pushing you to look for other people, even...
    <br>Yes. And I remember...
    <br>For example I was in a serious relationship and I used to blame my ex-boyfriend and say,
    <br>"Don't you want to look at other girls and to do something with them? Because I do."
    <br>I was blaming him.
    <br>I was asking him, "Don't you feel like that? Don't lie. I feel that way."
    <br>I couldn't understand.
    <br>I was feeling that everyone had this kind of feeling.
    <br>When I talked to my mother and said, "I don't know what's happening to me. I feel like going with men to flirt,
    <br>and that was like 'feeding' me, giving me strength.”
    <br>I didn't understand that.
    <br>I even asked Christians what was wrong with me, because I could say "No".
    <br>I wanted to go for a dinner, to get attention - it seemed like it gave me power, confidence, strange feeling to me.
    <br>At the same time, it made you feel like you had power and confidence.
    <br>How did they make you feel about yourself, knowing that you kept having eyes for every man in the room?
    <br>When I wasn't a Christian, that made me to feel cool.
    <br>When I became a Christian, without my conscience, I started to feel guilty and very bad.
    <br>That's how the spiritual battle started.
    <br>When I started to read the Word of God, when Jesus touched my heart, I felt so bad.
    <br>I even thought that God didn't love me.
    <br>Right now, after the deliverance, every time when...
    <br>Because we are human...
    <br>If I had a mind, the thought or something...
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua said, "Jesus loves her", this mind was like a fire to every thought coming to my head.
    <br>It is an incredible feeling.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>You received your deliverance, as we saw on the screen.
    <br>Tell us what was your experience, when the man of God prayed for you.
    <br>It's incredible.
    <br>I was praying for deliverance a long time ago.
    <br>I went to my church and pastor prayed for me to cast out the demon.
    <br>I didn't know what kind of demon I had, but I knew I had one.
    <br>That's very important to ask God, to reveal if you are delivered or not.
    <br>I knew I was not delivered.
    <br>When other pastors prayed for me I didn't feel anything, and it was like "really?"
    <br>but when T.B. Joshua was praying with the power of God, my body...
    <br>I couldn't handle my body anymore.
    <br>I was loosing the conscience.
    <br>At the same time, my spirit started to feel happy.
    <br>I started to pray with T.B. Joshua saying, "Go out, in the name of Jesus".
    <br>Then the demon manifested.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now, you have been with us, in the church for another week, since your deliverance.
    <br>Tell us what are the changes you have seen now.
    <br>You know, I could...
    <br>The most important change for me - that's something I would like to maintain, for that I pray to God everyday...
    <br>When I read the Bible it enters my heart.
    <br>Before I used to read the Bible and it was like, "I want to understand but I don't. It doesn't touch me anyhow."
    <br>Right now, I read it and I remember it.
    <br>Can you believe that?
    <br>Hallelujah! Puts your hand together for Jesus!
    <br>What can you say about this spirit of flirting, that you have been delivered from?
    <br>Are you still having the urge, are you still looking around, anytime you move around?
    <br>I can look but I don't feel anything.
    <br>I mean, I'm not gonna be like this, you know.
    <br>I look at the person but I don't have any feeling, like talking or whatever.
    <br>That's a good feeling - yeah!
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>What a wonderful deliverance.
    <br>Now, that you are free, we want you to tell your word of advice to people watching and listening to you
    <br>all over the world.
    <br>I was praying, "Lord, what could I say to people?"
    <br>That is what came to my head.
    <br>I will read from 1 John 1:6.
    <br>"If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
    <br>But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another,
    <br>and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin." 1 John 1:6-7
    <br>So, my message would be, "Check your life. Are you walking in the light? Are you a liar?"
    <br>Because I was a liar.
    <br>At some moment I said to God, "God, if I die today, I will go to hell. Help me. Save me."
    <br>Now, I'm here - wooo!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Lastly, we want you to give a word of advice to women or even men watching you,
    <br>who maybe find themselves having the similar problem of this flirtatious spirit.
    <br>What should they do?
    <br>Well, that worked for me.
    <br>First of all, ask God to reveal... to deliver you.
    <br>Because without deliverance, with the mind or body it's impossible.
    <br>Our flesh cannot defeat satan - it's impossible.
    <br>We need the Holy Spirit.
    <br>First of all, we need to ask God for a deliverance and for the strength to say "No".
    <br>We need to please God, not people!
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We encourage you sister; you are delivered by the Word of God - make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>to maintain this deliverance, and the best is yet to come for you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you, in Jesus name.
