  <p>    
    <br>My name is Yusuf Hassan
    <br>I am from Adamawa State, Nigeria.
    <br>I worked with the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).
    <br>In 1996, I was among the team of officers from NDLEA that came to
    <br>The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations to arrest Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>There were 18 of us and six soldiers.
    <br>Some of us went to the old site of the church while some came here.
    <br>I was among those that came here. I took a position outside with a gun.
    <br>We were all armed.
    <br>I stood at the entrance gate of the church.
    <br>I was in charge of that gate.
    <br>Any vehicle coming in was allowed; any vehicle going out was not allowed.
    <br>We were supposed to come the Sunday before the Sunday we came
    <br>but the person that submitted the petition that Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>deals on drugs, told us that the Prophet would be on a pilgrimage that Sunday.
    <br>On Friday, the man came to the office and told us that the man of God was back.
    <br>We then prepared and came here to arrest Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We came, arrested the man of God and left with him that Sunday morning.
    <br>On our way to the office we asked him if he was a man of God.
    <br>Let him disappear if he's powerful.
    <br>When we got to our office we took his statement.
    <br>We searched the church premises but didn't find any drugs.
    <br>At the old site, our officers destroyed a lot of things while searching for the drugs
    <br>but we couldn't find anything.
    <br>Investigation was carried out; for 13 days he was there.
    <br>On the 13th day he was released because nothing incriminating
    <br>was found on him or with him, according to the investigation.
    <br>So, he was let go.
    <br>Among the officers that came to arrest Prophet T.B. Joshua then,
    <br>more than 3 of them are no longer alive
    <br>and the 18 officers, except for myself, have been dismissed.
    <br>I am on suspension.
    <br>I was charged to court and detained in Kirikiri for 10 months before I was granted bail.
    <br>But the case is still pending in federal high court until today.
    <br>How did you come to believe that the man of God is dealing with drugs?
    <br>It was a petition someone wrote to our chairman.
    <br>He said that the man in The Synagogue habours people and deals drugs.
    <br>That was why the General ordered Prophet T.B. Joshua's arrest.
    <br>I want Prophet T.B. Joshua to forgive me and ask God to deliver me from
    <br>the participation I took in his arrest.
    <br>I want the man of God to pray for me.
    <br>Falsely accused of drug dealing by the (NDLEA) National Drug Law Enforcement Agency,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was arrested and held in cell for 13 days.
    <br>This is the first appearance of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>having just been released from the cell.
    <br>You can see the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua looking lean, having spent 13 days in the cell.
    <br>I am using this opportunity to thank you all for your unequal efforts towards my absence.
    <br>God Almighty will continue to be with you.
    <br>If you say to yourself, "Why me of all this trouble, persecution,
    <br>tribulation and all sorts of things," I want you to now think back and ask, 
    <br>"Why me of all these spiritual blessings in my life?"
    <br>When you count the blessing of God in your life, doubt will fly away.
    <br>Even if you are suffering and you lack of this and that, remember
    <br>the blessings of God like food, shelter and many others you are enjoying today.
    <br>Having searched and found nothing against him,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was released from the cell
    <br>and the following Sunday appeared in the church service
    <br>to thank the members and appreciate their love and support during his absence.
