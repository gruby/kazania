  <p>    
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out of this body!
    <br>All over your body - Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Every part of your body -
    <br>Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Why are you doing this to me now?  My company will fall.
    <br>Every part of your body!
    <br>Would  you not leave me alone?
    <br>Right now,
    <br>in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Go!
