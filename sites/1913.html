    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>I know you will agree with me that we are in a time
    <br>where there is a manifestation of the spirit of fear everywhere -
    <br>fear of this, fear of that, fear of COVID-19.
    <br>But the good news is that we have a Friend, the Holy Spirit,
    <br>who can help us to defeat this monster called fear.
    <br>And distance is not a barrier to the move of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>During the Interactive Prayer Sessions here on Emmanuel TV, so many have been delivered,
    <br>healed from this affliction COVID-19 and indeed the fear of it.
    <br>We have been bringing to you their testimonies one by one.
    <br>Today, we are going to share with you another wonderful testimony from a couple from South Africa.
    <br>But first, let us watch how the divine miracle happened in their lives
    <br>during the last Interactive Prayer Session here at the Emmanuel TV Studios; let's watch.
    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>My name is Elmarie Malan from South Africa.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>My name is Izak Malan, also from South Africa.
    <br>We have symptoms - my nose is blocked, I have headaches and weakness of the body.
    <br>I went to do a test for coronavirus; here is the test result.
    <br>The result came out that I am positive for coronavirus.
    <br>At the moment, I've got this dry cough and sweating.
    <br>I change shirts four to five times during the night and I also have weakness of the body.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you can see this couple all the way from South Africa,
    <br>while here we are in the Emmanuel TV Studio in Lagos, Nigeria,
    <br>a far distance, thousands of kilometers from us.
    <br>This shows that distance is not a barrier.
    <br>As you see, they are far away in South Africa and here we are in Nigeria.
    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier for Jesus.
    <br>Yes, we are in a world of trouble; we hear negative news every day, people getting sick or losing their jobs.
    <br>Many are today on the sickbed, many lost their job, many couldn't make it, but let me tell you something:
    <br>Trials are the soil in which faith flourishes.
    <br>This trouble does not impair us but improves us, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let me encourage your faith.
    <br>I remind you of the words of Prophet T.B. Joshua who said that,
    <br>"I am who I am as a product of the conviction that victory in Christ Jesus is victory indeed
    <br>and the rest is history."
    <br>This means the moment you put your faith in Christ Jesus, all your trouble will become history.
    <br>If you believe in Christ Jesus, He has come to put an end to our past and give birth to our future.
    <br>I proclaim to you, madam, that distance is not a barrier for Jesus!
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot cure; never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>I am here to proclaim to you God's faithfulness.
    <br>Jesus never said there will be no more healing; He never said there would be no more deliverance.
    <br>But you have a role to play; what is your role?
    <br>The state of your heart matters.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart, and the Bible says when we hold offence, pain and grudges, our heart is imprisoned.
    <br>Right now, I am here to declare that the moment you let go of offence, you will receive in a moment
    <br>what you have been seeking for years.
    <br>Your heart needs to be at its best for God, to receive from Him.
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Right now, receive a hearing heart, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be delivered from the prison of sickness, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever symptoms, whatever virus, be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever virus, whatever symptoms, come out of your body in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out! Vomit it out! Come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Kneel down and vomit it out, in the name of Jesus! Come out!
    <br>I command whatever virus, come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>INCURABLE DISEASE CURED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST!!!
    <br>Out of your lungs, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I command that substance, come out of your lungs!
    <br>That deadly virus, come out! Be flushed out!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever virus in your body, I command it out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That virus, deadly disease, come out of your body!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Out of your body, out of your lungs, out of your fluids, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Receive strength, in Jesus' name.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers, you can see them under the power of the anointing of God.
    <br>The same power, you are under the same anointing.
    <br>This anointing that set them free will set you free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>You are free, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>INCURABLE DISEASE CURED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST!!!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Amen. Jesus has set you free from this deadly virus.
    <br>Madam, you said your nose was blocked, you had headaches and body pain.
    <br>How did you feel during the prayer?
    <br>Tell us what you experienced. How do you feel now?
    <br>I can breathe out.
    <br>Show us the things that now you are able to to which you couldn't do before.
    <br>Do you still experience a headache?
    <br>I can do push-ups again!
    <br>Viewers, you are seeing this woman far away in South Africa.
    <br>She was saying her nose was blocked, she couldn't move like this, she had body pain.
    <br>You can see now she is freely delivered; Jesus has set her free.
    <br>Any moment from now, the same anointing will visit you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Sir, tell us, how do you feel in your body?
    <br>Do you experience body pain? How do you feel?
    <br>The dry cough is gone and I vomited poisonous things.
    <br>Praise Jesus! I thank Jesus! I am free!
    <br>The dry cough is gone. I thank Jesus!
    <br>I can inhale deep into my lungs. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I thank the Lord Jesus for my strength. He is our Healer!
    <br>And we are strong. The virus is dead, in Jesus' name!
    <br>We are healed, in Jesus name!
    <br>It was a wonderful experience; Jesus is alive.
    <br>I can take a deep breath. My nose is not blocked anymore.
    <br>- The dry cough is gone, thank Jesus!
    <br>- And we are strong!
    <br>Now you are healed by Christ's Word, you must be ruled by God's Word.
    <br>That healing you have received is to follow Jesus, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers, you have seen that distance is not a barrier for Jesus.
    <br>The same anointing that set them free from this deadly virus, you are under the same influence.
    <br>All the way from South Africa, and we are here in Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>This shows that distance is not a barrier for Jesus.
    <br>Right now, in the name of Jesus:
    <br>Whatever sickness, whatever disease - in the name of Jesus, be free from your prison of sickness!
    <br>Be delivered from that sickness, disease, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That deadly virus, sickness, disease - I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command healing on you, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the name of Jesus - be healed, be free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Whatever is holding you down - be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, be loosed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>I can see you being healed!
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>I can see you being healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Distance is not a barrier for Jesus - you are free, you are healed, in Jesus' name!
    <br>We can't wait to hear your testimony that Jesus has done it again and again for you, in Jesus name!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Glory be to God! Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Right now, the couple are going to be joining us live at the Emmanuel TV Studios,
    <br>so we can listen to their faith-building testimony.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>You are both welcome back once again to the Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>and we want to listen to your wonderful testimony, to the glory of God.
    <br>My name is Izak Malan; we are from South Africa.
    <br>We stand in awe and amazement with the way God touched us in our house.
    <br>We thank Jesus.
    <br>My name is Elmarie Malan.
    <br>I'm sitting here today to announce to the world: The deadly coronavirus is dead in my body!
    <br>There are no more traces of the coronavirus.
    <br>The incurable disease is cured in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>There is no disease or sickness that is incurable.
    <br>Jesus Christ can cure and is curing all diseases all over the world.
    <br>The symptoms that I experienced were a blocked nose, headaches and weakness in my body.
    <br>That is what I suffered from.
    <br>Our weakness was so severe that it was difficult for us to make a meal or shower during the day.
    <br>We couldn't do our daily exercise like we used to;
    <br>we couldn't go out and run anymore and do our exercises.
    <br>Our situation started about three weeks ago.
    <br>I was sweating a lot during the night and had to change shirts four to five times.
    <br>I slept on towels and was forced to change them during the night.
    <br>I had a dry cough and weakness in my body.
    <br>The doctor said Izak must do a test, and I did a test to be prudent.
    <br>I was absolutely shocked to find out that in my medical report, I tested positive for COVID-19.
    <br>It was awful to think that this deadly virus that caused so much havoc in the world was in my body.
    <br>We sent an email to Emmanuel TV and told them about how Elmarie was positive for COVID-19
    <br>and we explained some of the symptoms I had experienced.
    <br>By grace, they phoned us and we thank Jesus for that.
    <br>During the prayer, at one point, I took off my jacket because I was getting hot.
    <br>Before that time, my body was very weak,
    <br>and just moments after the prayer, instantly, I regained my strength.
    <br>It was actually awesome because I'm not normally a sick person at all.
    <br>Just to experience that I was sick and weak in my body
    <br>and all of a sudden, I gained this godly strength - it was awesome!
    <br>We serve a wonderful God.
    <br>My right hand started shaking and my right arm was lifting up.
    <br>I experienced a lot of pain in my right arm.
    <br>Then I started coughing uncontrollably for a long time - deep within my lungs and stomach.
    <br>It was so severe that after a while, my stomach muscles ached
    <br>and it was difficult to cough anymore because I was so tired.
    <br>Then I also vomited poisonous substances.
    <br>Jesus touched me and He healed me.
    <br>The sweating stopped; I don't need to change shirts anymore during the night.
    <br>The immediate change in our bodies was that strength came.
    <br>Like we said, we couldn't exercise but just a day after the prayer, we went out of our house
    <br>and we walked in the neighbourhood.
    <br>We walked around the block, which we couldn't do before.
    <br>We could iron again.
    <br>We could clean the house, which we couldn't do before.
    <br>I can inhale deep into my lungs - a thing I couldn't do before but after the prayer, it was possible.
    <br>I don't have any headaches anymore.
    <br>Also, my nose is open and I can breathe in and out, and we have strength.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty!
    <br>After this wonderful encounter, when you went back to the hospital, what happened next?
    <br>We went back after the interactive prayer to redo our tests, and we thank the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Here is my result saying, "No more coronavirus!"
    <br>"Not detected: COVID-19"
    <br>Thank You, Lord Jesus.
    <br>We say thank you to Prophet T.B. Joshua and the whole Emmanuel TV Team
    <br>who made this wonderful encounter possible for us.
    <br>We thank Jesus that Elmarie and I are free from COVID-19.
    <br>We praise Jesus.
    <br>He is a wonderful, awesome God!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Our sister was declared medically free from COVID-19 and our brother here, as well,
    <br>was completely healed from the symptoms, and the couple are rejoicing today in the goodness of God.
    <br>Definitely, distance is not a barrier - I experienced it.
    <br>We experienced the Lord Jesus in our house through the prayer of faith that was offered for us.
    <br>What I have learnt through this whole experience is that we can be close to Jesus Christ,
    <br>and then all of a sudden, we are in a situation
    <br>but it is to test our faith and it is for us to glorify our Lord Jesus.
    <br>So, we need to run to Jesus Christ!
    <br>Distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Look in faith to Jesus and He will help you.
    <br>Our prayer is that the leaders, governments and presidents of each nation
    <br>will turn to the Lord God for His wisdom and guidance into the future,
    <br>so that God's peace, mercy and grace can come over our countries.
    <br>INCURABLE DISEASE CURED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST!!!
    <br>After The Distance Is Not A Barrier Interactive Prayer,
    <br>I thank the Lord Jesus that my strength instantly came back.
    <br>I can now jump!
    <br>Without any problem!
    <br>I'm free! Jesus made me free!
    <br>During the prayer session, you also saw that I could do push-ups.
    <br>I took the advice of Prophet T.B. Joshua in this pandemic, which is to drink lemon water,
    <br>exercise our bodies, get sunlight and keep our bodies warm.
    <br>Now, I am strong, I can do that. There is no barrier for me. I am free!
    <br>I can inhale very deep into my lungs.
    <br>I can also jump, skip and run around!
    <br>My heart rate during this sickness was 85 but now it is back to 55 again,
    <br>so I praise Jesus and thank Him for that.
    <br>We thank God for our health.
    <br>I have no symptoms. I am free!
    <br>My strength is back and I can do a lot of things again.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank you, Emmanuel TV Team!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, from a scientific angle, this is a positive medical report for COVID-19, the deadly virus
    <br>and scientifically also, this is a negative report for COVID-19.
    <br>So, both scientifically and spiritually, this is clear evidence. What else again?
    <br>How could anyone question so much evidence?
    <br>Viewers all over the world, let this wonderful testimony encourage you that indeed Jesus lives.
    <br>He never said goodbye; He never said there would be no more healing;
    <br>He never said there would be no more miracles; He never said there would be no more deliverance.
    <br>In fact, His power and effectiveness have not changed just because he is no longer visible in our midst.
    <br>He can be in all places at all times through His Word and by His Spirit.
    <br>God is Spirit and because God is Spirit, distance is not a barrier to the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>So, viewers all over the world, use your faith to put a demand upon that anointing
    <br>and you too will soon be sharing your testimony, just as this couple have shared their own testimony
    <br>for the glory of God.
    <br>Remember, we treat but God heals.
    <br>So, let us be sure to include God in all of our decisions.
    <br>God bless you all and once again: Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>DISTANCE IS NOT A BARRIER!
    <br>For the glory of God, I'm going to demonstrate that I'm able to do push-ups once again!
    <br>Overjoyed at the immediate transformation, Elmarie recorded an exercise session
    <br>and sent the footage to Emmanuel TV, for the glory of God.
    <br>My health and my life are back to normal.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ! It's all over!
