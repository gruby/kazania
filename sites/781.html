  <p>    
    <br>Right now come out with all your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Come out with all your heart and begin to come against every familiar spirit.
    <br>Come out with all your heart.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, come out with all your heart.
    <br>To come out with all your heart is to confess what you believe.
    <br>Not just because T.B. Joshua asked you to pray and you pray,
    <br>but you believe; that is why you pray.
    <br>Not because T.B. Joshua says, "Stand up and let us pray" and you stand up,
    <br>but because you believe; that is why you stand up.
    <br>If you don't believe, don't bother to stand up.
    <br>Don't say that you stand up because I asked you to stand up.
    <br>Without your belief there is nothing I can do.
    <br>You have a role to play.
    <br>When we say "with all your heart", we mean: confess what you believe, say what you believe.
    <br>If you don't believe in the name of Jesus, don't bother to say it,
    <br>because it is not going to be profitable, or there is no reward in it.
    <br>Right now, make sure you confess what you believe, what is in your heart.
    <br>Come out with all your heart and come against every familiar spirit.
    <br>Familiar spirit means a spirit that is not of God,
    <br>spirit that has nothing to do with God, strange spirit, spirit behind your situation,
    <br>spirit that caused your situation,
    <br>spirit around your will, not God's will.
    <br>We say, "Let the will of God be done", but you have your own will.
    <br>If the will of God says, "Go this way", your spirit will say, "Let's go this way".
    <br>There is a spirit around your will.
    <br>Right now, come against every familiar spirit and begin to say, "I'm a child of God".
    <br>Anywhere you are hiding, I'm a child of God; come out right now and leave me.
    <br>Leave my business; I'm a child of God.
    <br>Leave my life; I'm a child of God.
    <br>I confess Jesus; every knee shall bow - bow right now.
    <br>Every tongue shall confess.
    <br>Begin to confess right now, you evil spirit, you familiar spirit, I say to you,
    <br>"I'm a child of God, come out of my life."
    <br>In the name of Jesus, all knees shall bow, every tongue shall confess.
    <br>I say to you right now,
    <br>you evil spirit, you familiar spirit, I am a child of God -
    <br>come out of my life, career, business, finances!
    <br>Confess...
    <br>The SCOAN Live Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>You have said...
    <br>Let me pray with you, you just pray with me in spirit.
    <br>Be in the spirit, begin to pray in the spirit with me.
    <br>I say to every familiar spirit around and within you to come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Live Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Every darkness, because this spirit is darkness...
    <br>You spirit that stands for darkness within and outside, I say come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Live Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>The spirit that kills, steals and destroys, the spirit that instructs you wrongly,
    <br>the spirit that commands you wrongly – come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>That name has been given to you right now.
    <br>You can fortify yourself, overhaul everything that has to do with you.
    <br>Open your lips and begin to pour out the blood of Jesus, the name of Jesus.
    <br>Say to that familiar spirit; command the familiar spirit where to go.
    <br>You familiar spirit, I command you, you evil spirit.
    <br>Whatever spirit, whatever name, I say to you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Command them!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>The SCOAN Live Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>You want to talk to yourself, you want to talk to your spirit.
    <br>Every will that is not God’s will – within and outside – command them out!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Look, if the will of God had been achieved in your life,
    <br>I'm very sure that you would have been an authority in your field.
    <br>There is a will that is disturbing you, that seems to stand against the will of God in your life.
    <br>We say, let the will of God be done.
    <br>When we know the will of God, we pray and our prayer would be answered.
    <br>We trust in Him, when we know the will.
    <br>If it is the will of God to deliver you, you can now begin to pray towards deliverance.
    <br>But if it is not His will to set you free, and you pray for deliverance, you can never be delivered.
    <br>We need to know His will.
    <br>Now we want to pray.
    <br>Every will that stands against your destiny, career, business, future, finances, life,
    <br>begin to release yourself.
    <br>Come on, open your lips right now!

    <br>I destroyed his career.
    <br>He wants to be a chief engineer in petroleum.
    <br>He can never be a chief engineer in petroleum.
    <br>He will become a great man in this world.
    <br>I'm a satan.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Let me pray with you and pray for you.
    <br>I command every spirit that disturbs your career, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>every spirit that seems to stand against you and disturb you, in the name of Jesus, out!

    <br>Ask for His grace to live for Him by the spirit of obedience, faithfulness,
    <br>kindness, humility, self-control.
    <br>Ask Him to make you a channel;
    <br>a channel of love where there is hatred,
    <br>a channel of obedience where there is disobedience,
    <br>a channel of pardon where there is hurt,
    <br>a channel of forgiveness where there is wrong,
    <br>a channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Ask Him - make me a channel by Your grace - let me live for You.
    <br>The SCOAN Live Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Help my unbelief, I believe.
    <br>You believed in your own way before.
    <br>Now ask Him to help you - to help your unbelief.
    <br>The SCOAN Live Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Receive the grace!
    <br>It is not by power, it is not by might, it is not by merit.
    <br>God often takes unlikely...
    <br>Right now, if you say you are nothing...
    <br>You are thinking of, "How will I be forgiven? I have done so much."
    <br>God often takes unlikely people.
    <br>Receive the grace!
    <br>I want to tell you that you have not committed any unpardonable sin.
    <br>Whatever you might have done, you are here today - it is a sign.
    <br>If you were not to receive forgiveness, you would have not come here,
    <br>your unforgiving spirit would hold you down,
    <br>but for you to be here - it is a sign that your past is over.
    <br>I say your past is over.
    <br>For a long time you have been trying to be here.
    <br>It is not today you planned to be here, you planned so many times you wanted to be here.
    <br>One thing and the other would hold you down, hostage,
    <br>but because your past is over, you are released to this liberty place.
    <br>I say your past is over!
    <br>What is your past?
    <br>You may not know your past.
    <br>Unfaithfulness.
    <br>What is your past?
    <br>Disobedience.
    <br>What is your past?
    <br>Pride, hatred, sin, unforgiving spirit - this is your past.
    <br>Because your past is over, that is why we are here since morning to rejoice.
    <br>We are supposed to enter here and rejoice and be praising Him.
    <br>We are just human beings, this is why we continue to ask.
    <br>The right thing to do when you enter here is to continue to dance and say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Because your past is over, that is why you are released to this arena of liberty.
    <br>My past is over!
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>My past is over!
    <br>Will you be able to maintain this new life?
    <br>Life without hatred, unfaithfulness.
    <br>If you know your position before God now, you are under His protection,
    <br>you are under His eyes.
    <br>Say, "I know the power I'm under".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>I know the power I'm under.
    <br>Viewers at home, confess this, maintain this grace.
    <br>I'm prophesying to your life.
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>This is three times.
    <br>God sent me to someone here, and my word will set you free.
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>Viewers at home, the way out for you has come!
    <br>Your career, your destiny, your finances, your business, your relationship -
    <br>The way out for you has come!
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>The SCOAN Live Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>If you don't have anything to hold, hold onto this one:
    <br>the way out for me has come.
    <br>All those things that have become impossible, seem so difficult to you,
    <br>"How will I get out of this?"
    <br>Yes, it is like that because of what you will soon become.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, your situation is like that because of what you will soon become.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If your situation seems so difficult beyond human,
    <br>what you will soon achieve - oh my God.
    <br>Your situation is a signal, but you don't know.
    <br>Do you know that your situation is a prophet?
    <br>When you see that situation like that, "Ah, something is coming".
    <br>These people when they know you are about to be elevated,
    <br>they will come with situation that will disfocus you,
    <br>a situation that you will not even be able to pray.
    <br>You will begin to say, "Ha!" - so that you will lose that thing that is coming.
    <br>Take this.
    <br>This is why I said to you - you have received the secret to success today.
    <br>You have many songs.
    <br>Nearer my God to Thee nearer to Thee

    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You go home with this message that your situation cannot determine your Christian life.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Don't allow your situation to rule you.
