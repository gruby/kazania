    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>DON'T TEMPT THE DEVIL TO TEMPT YOU
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>DON'T TEMPT THE DEVIL TO TEMPT YOU
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of Job.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Job 1:6
    <br>"Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
    <br>before the Lord, and satan also came among them.
    <br>And the Lord said to satan, 'From where do you come?'"
    <br>That is the question; God Himself was asking satan, 'From where do you come?'
    <br>How did you manage to mix with these people?
    <br>"So satan answered the Lord and said, 'From going to and fro on the earth,"
    <br>He said, 'roaming about from everywhere - he has no direction.
    <br>"and from walking back and forth on it.'
    <br>Then the Lord said to satan, 'Have you considered My servant Job',"
    <br>That is God; He is asking satan, 'Have you considered My servant?'
    <br>The word "consider" - what could it mean to you?
    <br>As it is used here, it is an idiom.
    <br>"'Have you considered My servant Job
    <br>that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man,
    <br>one who fears God and shuns evil?"
    <br>He has nothing to do with evil, unfaithfulness, disobedience.
    <br>Job 1:9
    <br>"So satan answered the Lord and said, 'Does Job fear God for nothing?'"
    <br>"Do You think he does it for nothing?
    <br>You mean Job fears You, is obeying You for nothing?"
    <br>Job 1:10
    <br>"Have you not made a hedge around him, around his household,
    <br>and around all that he has on every side?
    <br>You have blessed the work of his hands'."
    <br>"Tell me why he would not fear You.
    <br>After You have blessed the work of His hands,
    <br>tell me why he would not obey You."
    <br>Satan was telling God...
    <br>God said he was blameless, upright...
    <br>"You mean he is blameless and upright for nothing?
    <br>After You have blessed the work of his hands, his household,
    <br>tell me why he would not be blameless and upright."
    <br>Let's look at the Book of 1 Corinthians 10:13.
    <br>"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man;
    <br>but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted."
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>We are from Job now to that 1 Corinthians.
    <br>You can now put them together and see that they are very related.
    <br>"No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man;
    <br>but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted
    <br>beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make
    <br>the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it."
    <br>Wow, from the Book of Job.
    <br>DON'T TEMPT THE DEVIL TO TEMPT YOU
    <br>You know, Job did not.
    <br>You know how satan came to God.
    <br>The spirit that descended on Jesus was to humble Him
    <br>and at the same time, to make Him strong.
    <br>If you presume upon your strength and tempt the devil to tempt you,
    <br>that is not humility.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>If you presume upon your strength and tempt the devil to tempt you,
    <br>that is not humility
    <br>because you are using that power, grace as if it is yours.
    <br>The power given to us is not to be used at our will
    <br>but God's will.
    <br>This is why you cannot just rush to me and say, "Man of God, pray for me".
    <br>If God leaves you to your strength while praying for the demon-possessed,
    <br>you would rather be delivered - not the person you are praying for.
    <br>We must be careful in entering into temptation.
    <br>We should be careful not to enter into temptation.
    <br>But if God permits it... - underline it in your book because it is strange to you now;
    <br>I'm going with strange words.
    <br>If God allows it as a trial, test,
    <br>you must not think it strange and doubt your Guard.
    <br>If God allows the devil to tempt us, it will only improve us,
    <br>not impair us.
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>The devil's trials and temptations will only make us stronger if God allows it.
    <br>If a man claims he is a Christian or pastor,
    <br>leave him because the repercussion is great.
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>If you say, "In the name of Jesus, be healed,"
    <br>and you are not sent by Jesus, you will be delivered
    <br>instead of the one you are praying for.
    <br>If you understand me, let me see your hand.
    <br>Come on, brother.
    <br>If I'm not a pastor or Christian,
    <br>and I know I'm not a Christian but I profess Christianity, but I'm not,
    <br>and you have the spirit in you.
    <br>Whatever spirit you have in you, either the spirit of lust, killing, destruction,
    <br>and I now stretch my hand saying, "In the name of Jesus Christ, be delivered!",
    <br>and I'm not sent by Jesus, I will be delivered instead of you.
    <br>It means that spirit in you will come inside me.
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Those spirits tormenting you will come on me; the affliction...
    <br>It will not leave you, the sprit will still be there but they multiply.
    <br>Just that name Jesus, I will take some out of your affliction.
    <br>Imagine how many people I will be praying for,
    <br>I would be just taking their affliction; this is trouble you are seeing today.
    <br>This is why you see ministry today - there is no fire again.
    <br>Sit down.
    <br>There is wealth in the ministry but no fire.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>There is wealth - no fire.
    <br>You see us; we have vehicles, mansions, money, huge accounts all over the world but no fire.
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>And the devil is aware of this.
    <br>That is why you see them blow everywhere.
    <br>They know there is no fire; that is why you can see them blow...
    <br>They are swimming; it is their harvest season.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>It is their harvest season, because no fire.
    <br>We are tempting satan to tempt us.
    <br>How do we tempt satan to tempt us?
    <br>When we presume upon our strength and tempt satan to tempt us,
    <br>Jesus will leave us to our strength.
    <br>Mind you, as I have said,
    <br>if God allows it as a trial,
    <br>if God allows temptation as a trial, test of faith,
    <br>you must not think it strange and doubt your Guard.
    <br>See what happened to Job.
    <br>God allowed, permitted that temptation to Job, "Go ahead and tempt him".
    <br>Job did not think it strange and doubt his Guard.
    <br>Remember what his wife said to him, "Could all this be the reward of your righteousness?
    <br>Everything is down, your children have died, this has happened..."
    <br>You heard what Job said to his wife,
    <br>"The same God Almighty has been giving us salad for a long time,
    <br>now it is time for bitter leaf - why complaining?"
    <br>He never saw what happened as a strange thing and doubted his Guard.
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Let's ask ourselves, "What is the motive of satan in making people cry?"
    <br>The greatest thing satan aims at in tempting God's children
    <br>is to overthrow their position as children of God.
    <br>Look at those things that happened to you, when what I'm talking about happened.
    <br>You know in your private;
    <br>1. To cut off your dependence on God.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>To cut off your dependence on God.
    <br>You begin to say, "I don't know what has happened now."
    <br>Your dependence on God - to cut it off.
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>In our generation today, we don't know how much we need God.
    <br>Our generation does not know how much they need God
    <br>until the situation is critical.
    <br>Many of us are here today;
    <br>you can think of a situation that brought us together.
    <br>We don't know how much we need God.
    <br>If what you are here for is an issue you can handle,
    <br>you would not bother to come here.
    <br>You say, "I can do it".
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>You have forgotten you need God to smile, to close and open your eyes, to dress.
    <br>You have seen people; while mere dressing up, they collapse and die.
    <br>We have read where a colleague just opened his eyes and closed - he was gone.
    <br>You need God to sit down.
    <br>We have seen people; mere sitting - that is the end of life.
    <br>And we have seen people just standing and collapsing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>I need God to smile, dance, look, sleep, eat,
    <br>to say thank you, stretch my hand, dress up; I need God.
    <br>I know how much I need God.
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>2. To cut off your duty to Him.
    <br>You know, you have a duty to Him.
    <br>"What are you talking about?" - unfaithfulness occupying your heart.
    <br>Disobedience.
    <br>You see God in a bad light.
    <br>"Jesus - no."
    <br>3. To cut off your communion with God.
    <br>"I fasted and prayed; what else again? What do I need to do next?"
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Your communion with God.
    <br>These are the greatest things satan is aiming at.
    <br>We must be careful in entering into temptation
    <br>but if God permits it, we must not think it strange and doubt our Guard.
    <br>These are challenges we are facing in the church today.
    <br>When you look at how many times in churches today the name "Jesus" is mentioned,
    <br>compared to how many times the name "satan" is mentioned;
    <br>you will see satan's name is mentioned more than the name "Jesus".
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>The name "satan" is mentioned more than the name "Jesus", who is our Saviour.
    <br>All the time, "satan, satan..."
    <br>Don't Tempt The Devil To Tempt You - T.B. Joshua
    <br>Let us beware of spiritual pride
    <br>which has been the cause of destruction today.
    <br>We call it "spiritual pride".
    <br>You should beware of spiritual pride.
