  <p>    
    <br>When the heat of trial hits us, our real self surfaces.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When the heat of trial hits us, our real self surfaces.
    <br>One can come to me and say, "This man is gently and very nice".
    <br>I would say, "Oh, he is nice? I want to see his track record, where he is coming from,
    <br>the battles he has fought."
    <br>When the heat of trial, temptation, affliction hits you, your real self surfaces.
    <br>Your real self surfaces.
    <br>"He is quiet, gentle, very humble; what a wonderful man." - I say, "Aha!"
    <br>"He is wonderful, quiet,  gentle; hmm."
    <br>Your real self surfaces...
    <br>Those things you keep to yourself; only you and God.
    <br>And people keep saying you are very nice, "What a wonderful, quiet man",
    <br>but many things you keep to yourself.
    <br>Only you and God; your Creator knows.
    <br>You keep hiding it, "Yes, sir... "
    <br>What are those things we keep to ourselves?
    <br>Those elements like jealousy, bitterness, anger, envy, resentment, hatred -
    <br>you have the ability to keep those things to yourself.
    <br>"I heard that you have been promoted to GM of the company; wonderful - congratulations",
    <br>whereas inside you is not a congratulation.
    <br>Inside you is, "Why not me? Why him? I know him. Why not me?"
    <br>These are the things we keep to ourselves.
    <br>When the heat of trial, temptation, hits us, our real self surfaces.
    <br>Each time I look at you – your appearance – I need to look at your heart.
    <br>Some say, "I'm a Christian. I've been doing good. I've been very nice to people."
    <br>The manner you forgive, restore and help, in the same manner you will be helped and forgiven.
    <br>So, you show that what you are doing to people is not from your heart.
    <br>The manner you help, forgive and restore another person,
    <br>in the same manner you will be restored, helped and forgiven.
    <br>Therefore, whatever you are doing, do it with all your heart.
    <br>Look at everyone here today; you are seated as if you really mean what you are here for.
    <br>How many of us actually need Jesus?
    <br>Oh how I love Jesus
    <br>Because He went for me
    <br>He went for us; because He is no longer on the cross.
    <br>You really love Jesus?
    <br>In good times you are saying, "I love Jesus in good times" but in hard time... - question mark.
    <br>You love Jesus?
    <br>In good times, when there is a testimony, money in the pocket, food on the table; you love Jesus,
    <br>but when there is no money in the pocket, no food on the table; question mark.
    <br>Oh how I love Jesus
    <br>Because He went for me
    <br>When there is no money in the pocket; question mark.
    <br>When there is money; you love Jesus - indeed.
    <br>You love Him.
    <br>When the heat of trial, disappointment, failure, sickness, disease, affliction, setback hits,
    <br>your real self surfaces.
    <br>"I do come to a church all the time. I pay my tithe. I have stopped smoking. I don't know why this happened to me.
    <br>Why all this; I don't know. Oh my God. Look at my friend; he never worships God or goes to church -
    <br>see him, he is fine. Oh my God." - you begin to see Jesus in the bad light.
    <br>When you see people dancing in the church; you can spot those who have testimonies today.
    <br>Some people do like this... - you know he has a testimony.
    <br>When some people are like this, "Inner my heart Lord..."...
    <br>Because your life is ruled by your blessing.
    <br>If there is blessing you are happy and if there is no blessing...
    <br>- Your life is ruled by your what?
    <br>- (Blessing.)
    <br>By your blessing.
    <br>OK, where is Jesus?
    <br>"Jesus - in good and hard times", tell your neighbour.
    <br>Where is Jesus?
    <br>Jesus – in good and hard times.
    <br>If you know Jesus in good times, you are a part-time Christian.
    <br>If you don't know Him in hard times, you are a part-time Christian.
    <br>Jesus is not looking for part-time but full-time Christians.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you know Jesus in good times and not in hard times, you are a part-time Christian".
    <br>Jesus is not looking for part-time Christians but full-time Christians.
    <br>You must know Him in good and hard times alike.
    <br>The way you help, you are helped.
    <br>The way you greet, the Spirit of God also greets you.
    <br>The way you forgive, you would be forgiven.
    <br>The way you love your neighbour, the same way you are being loved by the Spirit of God.
    <br>Can you see; each time you receive you know it is a reward, because He is a Rewarder.
    <br>If you are giving what you do not need, you will continue to receive what you do not need.
    <br>If you give what your life depends on, you will receive what your life depends on from Jesus.
    <br>He has no farm, house or office; He is your neighbour, your brother.
    <br>Whatever you do to the little among you, that you do unto God.
    <br>What have you done to your neighbour today?
    <br>How many people have you blessed today?
    <br>... and you are coming to God for blessing.
    <br>You know; you come from somewhere - if you look right you see poor, if you look left you see poor,
    <br>at your back you see poor, at your front you see poor.
    <br>What have you done today to your neighbour?
    <br>Nothing, but you are waiting to receive from God.
    <br>In my local language we say:
    <br>Eni keni ti iwo be ni'pa
    <br>Whoever you have ability
    <br>Lati se iranlowo fun o
    <br>To assist
    <br>Oun na leni'keji re ranti re
    <br>He is your neighbour remember them
    <br>You must love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Your neighbour may not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Your neighbour may not be a Christian but love first.
    <br>Love first.
    <br>Your pain must be my pain and your joy must be my joy.
    <br>When you begin to see life in this manner, you are getting to the centre of your own world.
    <br>You are not blessed only because of your family but today people use that blessing only to their families.
    <br>You are blessed to bless others, including your family.
    <br>Amen?
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of John 8.
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>What do you thing I'm trying to say?
    <br>When I sing, I'm talking.
    <br>I'm not a singer; you know I can compose, but I'm preaching, prophesying.
    <br>When I say, "Inner my heart" I say I need your heart.
    <br>If we confess in our heart, "Jesus is my Lord", immediately you confess in your heart,
    <br>here, Jesus comes in to bring you the balance.
    <br>You are able to say the truth, and to listen to me with all your heart.
    <br>Here Jesus comes in to bring the balance.
    <br>As you are sitting, you can begin to engage your heart:
    <br>Lord Jesus, I am a sinner.
    <br>Come into my heart.
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul today.
    <br>Your heart can be engaged while you are listening to me.
    <br>Are you engaging your heart?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>In that Book of John 8 I take verse 3 there - it says:
    <br>"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.
    <br>They made her stand before the group
    <br>and said to Jesus, 'Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
    <br>In the Law of Moses commanded us to stone such woman. Now what do you say?'"
    <br>This is the question to Jesus.
    <br>They knew what to do by their law of Moses but they came to Jesus,
    <br>in order to have something to trap Him.
    <br>"They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing Him."
    <br>They were looking for a way of accusing Him; what they can do - this is an opportunity for them.
    <br>"But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with His finger.
    <br>When they kept on questioning Him, He straightened up and said to them,
    <br>'Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her'."
    <br>Hallelujah, this is the question, this is what I'm saying here.
    <br>How can the kettle call the pot black – birds of the same feather -
    <br>when they are all one, used for cooking?
    <br>When you go by this, "Let any one who is without sin be the first"...
    <br>When we are offended, we feel hurt and blame the offender.
    <br>When we are offended, we feel hurt, embarrassed and blame our offender.
    <br>We always defend our bitterness, our anger.
    <br>We always defend our right – whether we are right or wrong – we are always there to defend
    <br>to justify our reason of doing what we are doing.
    <br>"This is a small boy, I trained him, I sent him to school; look at the insult he is passing to me."
    <br>This is you reason; inability to forgive - the reason why you won't forgive him.
    <br>"I trained him, I'm older than him..."
    <br>If that is the case, if by age, experiences in the world - I would not be the one to stand before you today -
    <br>we should look for someone else to come and address you.
    <br>... if by age and experiences out there, or by where we are coming from and what we have seen in life -
    <br>I should not be the one to stand here and address you.
    <br>We always defend our bitterness, anger and right to justify our reason or inability to forgive.
    <br>"Don't talk to me. You are living in a poor community. Do you know who I am? Please! No, he is illiterate"
    <br>It is at this point, Jesus advises us by saying, “How can the kettle call the pot black?”
    <br>How can the kettle call the pot black?
    <br>This means, "How can the kettle blame pot?"
    <br>How can you blame him?
    <br>How can anybody from over there come to blame anyone here, when you are birds of the same feather?
    <br>Remember your own weakness; you are not the right person to judge.
    <br>This is what Jesus referred to, when he bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.
    <br>As they kept on questioning Him, the Bible says He straightened up and said to them,
    <br>"Let anyone of you without envy, unforgiveness, anger, bitterness, jealousy, pride
    <br>hold offence, or continue to absorb; keep blaming your neighbour for offence he has done to him."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let anyone of you without envy, jealousy, pride, unforgiveness hold offence".
    <br>When you take your Bible to the Book of Luke 23 and go straight to the verse 34:
    <br>“Jesus said, ‘Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing’.”
    <br>That statement alone - what we are saying here, "Father forgive them".
    <br>Take note of the word, ‘them’ because it includes both the offender and offended.
    <br>It includes both the offender and offended -
    <br>the wrong and the right.
    <br>This should be Christians’ standard of life: Father, forgive them.
    <br>The word 'them' - take note; the wrong and the right.
    <br>This is why Jesus said, when he bent down to write on the ground with His finger, He said to them,
    <br>"Let anyone of you without envy, jealousy...".
    <br>He simplified the sin mentioned there.
    <br>He said, "Let anyone of you without sin..."
    <br>You say, "Sin - what is sin?"
    <br>Many of you may not even understand that, "just sin".
    <br>This is what the Bible said there, "just sin".
    <br>But, "Let anyone of you without envy, jealousy, bitterness, pride..." - those things you keep to yourself.
    <br>Only when the heat of trial and temptation comes, "Don't talk to me like that! I will deal with you!"
    <br>You say, "He? This man can talk like this?"
    <br>You say somebody offended you, "The man offends me. He used to be my servant; he is a millionaire now.
    <br>I helped him. He was working under me. In fact; look at the way he addresses me - in what way."
    <br>We always defend our bitterness to justify our reason, "He is my boy. I trained him." - this is to defend.
    <br>That is the reason why you have to say that.
    <br>That is why, "Yes, I have to say that. I helped him. I gave him capital to start a business.
    <br>Now, whatever he becomes today, he should be very careful."
    <br>Oh?!
    <br>... because of the capital you gave him.
    <br>What of Jesus?
    <br>He has no sin but your sin.
    <br>"Father, forgive them."
    <br>Take note of the word, ‘them’.
    <br>It includes both the offender and what?
    <br>The offended.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Let anyone of you who is without envy, jealousy, bitterness, unforgiveness, pride
    <br>hold offence.”
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is a reason why you shouldn't hold offence, whether you are right or wrong,
    <br>unless you are without envy, jealousy, pride, unforgiveness, bitterness, resentment, anger.
    <br>You are either a pot and your neighbour is a kettle, or you are a kettle and your neighbour is a pot;
    <br>birds of the same feather - pot and kettle used for cooking.
    <br>And I told you; the manner you forgive, restore, re-instate, greet, help, love another person,
    <br>you will be loved and forgiven by God.
    <br>By their fruit we shall know.
    <br>The manner you forgive, you will be forgiven.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The manner you forgive another person, you will be forgiven.
    <br>The manner you love another person, you will be loved.
    <br>The manner you restore your brother, you will be restored.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know; what you are doing nowadays is not from your heart.
    <br>Sometimes when I come you say, "Good morning, Sir".
    <br>I say, "Oh, well done".
    <br>When you say, "Good morning", I say, "Good morning" - while you go I will look at your back.
    <br>I will say, "Well done, sir."
    <br>Some people would say, "Why the man of God said, 'well done'?"
    <br>I'm greeting you, I know you.
    <br>You raise your brother's hand up saying, "Winner!", while your heart will say, "Why not me?".
    <br>"Winner!", they call you and you say, "Winner!" - your heart will be saying, "Why not you?".
    <br>You invest in the brother, you give him millions; by the time he lefts, you sit down and look at yourself and say,
    <br>"How will I know that this boy will appreciate what I have done now? How this boy would pay me back?"
    <br>Our heart...
    <br>Match your action with your words.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>- (Match your action with your words.)
    <br>- I cannot hear you.
    <br>(Match your action with your words.)
    <br>If you are able to match your action with your word, it comes from your heart.
    <br>You say, "Be healed!", and I say "Be healed!" - my heart is telling me "Which kind of a healing?".
    <br>That has nullified "Be healed!"
    <br>And I say, "Check yourself".
    <br>Reply: "I still feel pain."
    <br>When I say "Be healed!", I know what is going on in my heart.
    <br>"Be free! Amen."
    <br>Your heart keeps telling you, "Who is free? You are in a bondage."
    <br>A lot of voices are in our heart.
    <br>Match your action with your words.
    <br>This is the problem we have today.
    <br>You don't mean what you are saying, and you never mean what you are doing.
    <br>If you really mean...
    <br>While you sit down, you receive a phone call and hear that business you have been looking for; billion of dollars
    <br>- the man is just at the corner of your home, and he wants to see you in two minutes at your home.
    <br>You look around, "Where is usher? I'm pressed."
    <br>There is a language for every negative action.
    <br>Because you want to leave, you learn how to lie, "I'm pressed", and you are not pressed.
    <br>By the time you get there you say, "I'm looking for a restroom."
    <br>"OK, there is one there."
    <br>By the time you get to the restroom, you call your business partner back.
    <br>You know; that place is good for calling, "Hello. What are you telling me?"
    <br>"I say that in two minutes I will get to your house. If I don't see you, I'm leaving the country."
    <br>You hide your handset.
    <br>You will now plan what to say, so that they would open the gate for you.
    <br>You begin to plan, "What will I say now? I need to take something from the vehicle, it is very serious."
    <br>Because your coming here is not from your heart.
    <br>We have not been doing things from our heart.
    <br>And faith is of man’s heart.
    <br>Whatever that does not come from your heart is sin.
    <br>You can never see things clearly if your action is not from your heart.
    <br>Seeing things clearly can make us see beyond our present situation.
    <br>"This is disappointment."
    <br>But you don't know that that disappointment is meant to preserve you, prepare you,
    <br>strengthen your desire and determination for God.
    <br>It is meant to stop you for a while and re-arrange your future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If your actions don't come from your heart, you cannot see things clearly.
    <br>You always see things on the surface.
    <br>What we are seeing now - if your coming here is not from your heart, we will only see,
    <br>"This man has a white beard. Is it dyed? What has happened? Look at him. He looks like my brother,
    <br>or my driver - just the same size. The man must be around fifty years of age.
    <br>He just wants to celebrate his birthday. Look at him; he is going to another direction. He will come back again.
    <br>What are those fruits? Can they give me one? I cannot get it."
    <br>Your heart will be jumping up and down.
    <br>Your heart will judge...; you will continue to be busy with your heart.
    <br>The heart that is busy cannot focus.
    <br>Oh my God; take that word.
    <br>Look at me; I am going this direction and something keeps telling me
    <br>that somebody is waiting for me at home.
    <br>The person - I don't know...
    <br>This is where I'm going to see somebody, but the heart keeps telling me, "Somebody is waiting for me at home
    <br>and I don't know whether I'll get there. I don't know if I meet the man at the office.
    <br>Last time he disappointed me. I don't know if he would disappoint me."
    <br>The heart keeps being busy; definitely you will lose focus.
    <br>You will probably not get here.
    <br>"Your heart is too busy." - tell your neighbour.
    <br>This is confusion in which we find ourselves.
    <br>Seeing clearly helps to see beyond our present situation.
    <br>... to preserve you, to prepare you, to strengthen your desire and determination, to stop you for a while
    <br>and re-arrange your future - this is your present situation, but you don't know, you just don't want it,
    <br>you do everything to remove it on your own.
    <br>The one that is waiting to re-arrange your future will say, "The man has gone; he didn't wait for me to arrange it.
    <br>I had to hold him to arrange his future before he moves. He has gone."
    <br>This is for you.
    <br>This is Jesus for you.
    <br>He asked the man at the pool of Bethesda, "What can I do for you? You want Me to pray for you?"
    <br>He didn't just grab the man and started praying, "I want to deliver you!" - no.
    <br>He needs your faith.
    <br>He needs your genuine willingness.
    <br>Our genuine willingness plus God’s ability work miracle.
    <br>If you are not and not ready to be genuine, no matter the power... - there is nothing.
    <br>He says, "I will make you fishers of men", if you what?
    <br>If you follow!
    <br>If you don't follow, He cannot make you to.
    <br>You have a role to play.
    <br>He says, “I will make you fishers of men
    <br>Fishers of men
    <br>I will make you fishers of men
    <br>If you follow Me"
    <br>That is the condition.
    <br>It is not all up to God and certainly, it is not all up to us.
    <br>It’s not all up to you; certainly, it is not all up to God.
    <br>Your genuine willingness and God’s ability work out things.
    <br>"If you follow Me"
    <br>If you don't follow Him...
    <br>The title: "How can the kettle blame pot?"
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Again.
    <br>You may be the kettle, your neighbour may be the pot -
    <br>birds of the same feather, used for cooking.
    <br>The way out:
    <br>if you are without envy, jealousy, unforgiveness, bitterness, resentment, hurt, anger,
    <br>you can hold offence.
    <br>I’m very sure, here in this world, before you can see anyone without envy,
    <br>jealousy, unforgiveness, bitterness, resentment, anger, hurt, you will go to Heaven.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why we should not hold offence, including me.
    <br>Holding offence is evidence that you are without any of these.
    <br>Let me pray with you, so that this message can have a place in your heart.
    <br>I pray this message finds a place in your heart.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Say, “Find a place in my heart.”
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(Find a place in my heart.)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(Find a place in my heart.)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(Find a place in my heart.)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(Find a place in my heart.)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(Find a place in my heart.)
    <br>Because it is a very serious issue.
    <br>The world is like this because of offence.
    <br>Your life is like this because of offence.
    <br>You can never have a way out, without stopping to hold offence.
    <br>No way out; I'm telling you.
    <br>Because if you get deliverance now, and you get delivered, and you see your offender,
    <br>you will lose your deliverance.
    <br>Immediately, you will lose your blessing.
    <br>"Ah, this is a man I don't want to see. This is this woman. I will not take this call; this is a foolish man."
    <br>You are losing your blessing.
    <br>You will receive your deliverance, blessing, healing but to maintain this healing, stop holding offence.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You will receive healing, deliverance, blessing.
    <br>To maintain these blessing, stop holding offence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The God that says, “Thou shall not lie” says, “Thou shall not kill” - the same God.
    <br>If you have lied, you have killed.
    <br>Why are you holding offence any longer?
    <br>Because you are without envy, unforgiveness, bitterness, hurt, anger;
    <br>that is why you are holding offence.
    <br>Can that be?
    <br>I pray this message finds a place in your heart,
    <br>in Jesus Christ’s name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>I'm free.
    <br>If you are free too, let me see your hand.
    <br>If the Spirit of God has touched you...
    <br>And you can begin to give a call; people you need to call - any opportunity you have,
    <br>- "I just want to say hi, I'm so so so..."
    <br>- "You call me?"
    <br>- "Yes, I call you. I've been praying for you. I love you so much..."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Send this message to you leaders.
    <br>If you have an opportunity to have a meeting  with you leaders, please tell them,
    <br>“Holding offence is like committing a crime because unforgiveness imprisons us.
    <br>It puts us in the prison, cage."
    <br>You just find that there is a limit on what you can do.
    <br>I can't do this - there is a limit.
    <br>It puts us in the prison.
    <br>And what is not done well is not done at all.
    <br>Unforgiveness is too dangerous for your future.
    <br>Don’t pretend to forgive; don’t pretend to love.
    <br>Like I have said, the manner you love is the manner you will be loved.
    <br>The manner you forgive is the manner you will be forgiven.
    <br>Whatever you want to do, let it come from your heart.
    <br>God is the Rewarder.
    <br>If you continue to blame others, you will never repent.
    <br>"Ah yes, he is very rude to me" - you will never repent.
    <br>Accept everything, "Yes, this is wrong. OK. I know I'm the one."
    <br>Because we are not fighting the flesh and blood; blaming others you will never repent.
    <br>God often uses anything.
    <br>You might be sitting, somebody would just come and start beating you.
    <br>"Ah, what have I done?"
    <br>Remember you are a Christian - you better run, leave the place.
    <br>Don't retaliate because you don't know why this has happened.
    <br>Everything, "Why God?"...
    <br>God often uses anything - think about that.
    <br>What is anything?
    <br>So many things have been used in the past to prepare you but you failed.
    <br>I can give you some good examples.
    <br>Position of some of you was overtaken by "fire".
    <br>You were in a position, and your junior was promoted to be your head, your boss.
    <br>You now say, "Eh? I serve God. I fast and pray. I'm always in the church. How can my junior,
    <br>whom I gave instructions, can be promoted to be my boss? Oh no; by fire."
    <br>You run to a witch-doctor.
    <br>You say, "This one is my junior - he was promoted and is my boss now. He is the one giving me instructions."
    <br>The witch-doctor will say, "What do you want me to do?"
    <br>"By fire, by fire."
    <br>You are given a powder.
    <br>Since he now became your boss, you have to clean the table for him - you drop the powder there.
    <br>That is the end.
    <br>One month, two months - you take over the position.
    <br>You don't know that...
    <br>Look, it is too early to say that the man is blessed.
    <br>The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>These are the lessons we should learn.
    <br>Many heroes collapsed; great men, the rich, the wealthy...
    <br>The beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>If you don’t finish well, everything you lived for is gone and the history about you is erased.
    <br>The evil that men do lives after them.
    <br>Many of you have been prepared for a generation yet unborn, just like apostles -
    <br>they were prepared for the generation yet unborn, so that when they die,
    <br>their work will live for the generation yet unborn.
    <br>This is what we are seeing now.
    <br>Your exit; anytime you behave remember your exit.
    <br>Always think about where your thought, attitude, behaviour will be credited to your account.
    <br>Our account is in our future, not now.
    <br>You are living, working now.
    <br>What we are doing now will be credited to our future.
    <br>What are you doing now that will be credited to your future?
    <br>If you are doing evil now, that evil will be credited to your future.
    <br>Are you doing good now?
    <br>The good you are doing now will be credited to your future -
    <br>you will find them in the future, where that physical strength is no longer there.
    <br>Let us remember our future.
    <br>My future is my life.
    <br>That is life.
    <br>Let me suffer now and enjoy in the future.
    <br>But enjoying now and suffering in future - that is...
    <br>How many of us; but we are not ready to suffer now and enjoy in future.
    <br>So, what you are going through - and you are running for to the witch-doctor, try to cut the journey -
    <br>which is to prepare you for the future.
    <br>This is what I have said.
    <br>God often uses anything to preserve, prepare, strengthen our desire and determination,
    <br>to stop us for a while and arrange our future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He is arranging your future.
    <br>Anything can be used to arrange your future; sickness, disappointment.
    <br>Those things will come but you need those experiences.
