    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>This is a section of people who have come to The SCOAN's prayer line
    <br>from different countries and continents, in search of a blessing from God.
    <br>Expectant mothers are arranged for prayer for safe delivery,
    <br>alongside couples with barrenness and infertility problems,
    <br>believing that Jesus is the answer.
    <br>This is one such couple.
    <br>Mr and Mrs Peter Van Zyl from South Africa have come with the problems of low sperm count
    <br>and inverted womb, barrenness and hotness of the body.
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for Mr and Mrs Van Zyl, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The man of God touches Mr Van Zyl commanding out all the problems that have held him
    <br>in bondage for so many years.
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>With a touch from Prophet T.B. Joshua, Mrs Van Zyl falls under the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>God is right now busy working out the answer.
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>On another occasion, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave Mr and Mrs Van Zyl fruit from the altar.
    <br>That's Mr Van Zyl.
    <br>And Mrs Van Zyl.
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>Before they were due to go home, Prophet T.B. Joshua saw Mr and Mrs Van Zyl in his office.
    <br>He asked them to go to the supermarket and select a gift for a baby.
    <br>When they brought the gift back to his office,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua told them in parables what God was about to do in their lives.
    <br>This is the child.
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>A few months later, Mr and Mrs Van Zyl came back to The SCOAN to share their testimony.
    <br>Mrs Gene Van Zyl is now pregnant.
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Gene Van Zel and this is my husband Peter Van Zyl.
    <br>We come from South Africa.
    <br>The problem that brought us to The SCOAN was the problem of barrenness.
    <br>In my case, I had an inverted womb and in the case of my husband,
    <br>he was suffering from low sperm count.
    <br>We went to the doctors in South Africa because we've been a couple for ten years now
    <br>and we've been actively seeking fruit of the womb for many years.
    <br>We went to the doctors and they said that it would not be possible for us to conceive children naturally.
    <br>But as children of God, we know that with God all things are possible.
    <br>As the man of God teaches us - as Christians, we know that we will
    <br>encounter tests and trials but these are not meant to destroy us.
    <br>But it is a difficult path for those going through the journey of barrenness,
    <br>you know the emotions that are attached.
    <br>Especially when people tell you they are pregnant, you want to celebrate with them,
    <br>but in your heart you are crying, "God, when is it my turn?"
    <br>Every time you see people having children, you keep asking God,
    <br>"When it is my turn? When is it me?"
    <br>But you've got to stand in faith and you've got to trust God.
    <br>So, we came to The SCOAN for the Fruit Of The Womb Meeting,
    <br>and by the grace of God, I am back to show the tummy now -
    <br>as you can see, I am actually pregnant!
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>The next time you see us, we will bring our child to testify to the glory of God.
    <br>We are soon going to be a mother and father!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Yes, God is certainly with us.
    <br>My name is Peter Van Zyl.
    <br>My wife and I are both South African.
    <br>We have been together for the past ten years and have been trying to conceive a baby.
    <br>During this time, it was very embarrassing for us whenever we would attend a family meeting
    <br>or a social gathering, there would be people with children.
    <br>Even, I would be reluctant to pick up one of the children and play with them
    <br>because I knew this would affect my wife emotionally
    <br>since it was a known fact - that we are both childless.
    <br>We went to the doctors and it was confirmed that it would be impossible for us
    <br>to naturally conceive a baby.
    <br>Thank God that we were then able to come to The SCOAN to ask the man of God,
    <br>"What is God's opinion about this matter?"
    <br>He said, "Simply believe God, put your faith in God Almighty
    <br>and He will bring breakthrough in your life."
    <br>We then left The SCOAN feeling quite comforted by this word from God,
    <br>and relaxing in the precious arms of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Quite some time afterwards, the man of God announced the Fruit Of The Womb Meeting
    <br>that was held last December.
    <br>By God's grace, we were able to attend this meeting.
    <br>The man of God prayed for us during this time and also offered us altar fruit.
    <br>By the grace of God, deliverance came to us during that time from our Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>by the hand of His anointed servant, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>So here we are today, testifying to the glory of God,
    <br>telling you that God certainly is who He says He is; He has what He says He has and
    <br>He can do what He says He can do.
    <br>As you can see, my wife is very nice and fat and pregnant!
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty!
    <br>All over the world, if you are facing the same problem, if you are facing trials,
    <br>if you are facing errors, listen to the message that comes forth through Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Make God's Word the standard for your life.
    <br>Remember what the man of God says:
    <br>"It is never proper for us to base faith on our improvement after prayer.
    <br>We should trust in God. Whether He heals us or not, He is still our Healer."
    <br>My advice to people suffering the same thing that we went through
    <br>is to trust God, wait on God's time because everything is perfect in God's time.
    <br>God is not a respecter of persons - He loves us as much as He loves any of His children.
    <br>If He can do it for us, who could not conceive naturally, He can do it for you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Mrs Van Zyl was in an advanced stage of pregnancy and her condition would not allow her to travel,
    <br>so only Mr Van Zyl was able to come and see Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Here you are. How's everything?
    <br>We are well sir. I just came from South Africa and my wife sends her greetings.
    <br>Thank you for the last time you spoke to us, but you spoke in parables,
    <br>and we would like to know the sex of our baby.
    <br>I was telling you people that your wife will deliver a baby boy
    <br>and his name is Abraham.
    <br>OK, thank you.
    <br>Abraham is a wonderful child.
    <br>Get ready for Abraham. He is a gift from God.
    <br>You know you have come all the way long.
    <br>A lot of intimidation, the marriage nearly crashed.
    <br>Your hope nearly hit the rocks.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This is the promise of God. At last!
    <br>I would like to give some gift to Abraham.
    <br>Yes, please. And sign it, if you can, sir.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>Abraham.
    <br>Back in South Africa the story continues,
    <br>as hearing the great news, the Emmanuel TV team went to Pretoria East Hospital
    <br>to visit Mr and Mrs Van Zyl and the new-born baby Abraham Van Zyl.
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>Hallelujah! A new beginning, a new chapter, a new life at last.
    <br>For Mr and Mrs Van Zyl, a million thanks are not enough
    <br>for the mighty Miracle Worker, our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Say, hello to daddy, hello to the Prophet.
    <br>The baby's name is Abraham, which means the 'father of all nations'.
    <br>We thank God so much for his life and for the miracles that He has done in our lives,
    <br>since we met Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and since we become a part of the Emmanuel TV family and The SCOAN's ministry.
    <br>We just want to give God all the glory!
    <br>May Jesus' name be honoured in us having this child.
    <br>We want to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua personally for making himself available
    <br>to be used by God is such a personal manner.
    <br>For a man of God of that calibre to be so approachable
    <br>yet we all know he is untouchable but so approachable
    <br>and for us to be able to go there and receive prayer like this.
    <br>We thank You, Jesus for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>May God use him mightily for decades to come, adding to his life
    <br>and keeping His hand upon his life, keeping him safely for us, for our generation.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Any person watching this testimony that also suffers from low sperm count,
    <br>or inverted womb, or some form of barrenness, would know how hard it is.
    <br>As a husband, you feel incomplete.
    <br>I never knew that there was hope.
    <br>I really want to thank God for the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and for God who has used him, to perform all these miracles in our lives.
    <br>I want to recommend going to The SCOAN.
    <br>Consistently watch Emmanuel TV; get accustomed to the message;
    <br>make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>Then, if you go, God can certainly perform the same miracle in your life that He did in ours.
    <br>Emmanuel. My name is Gene Van Zyl and this is my husband Peter Van Zyl.
    <br>With us is our little baby, Abraham.
    <br>We thank God for the glory and the grace to have this little baby.
    <br>Today, we are with him to testify of God's goodness and His mercy.
    <br>We thank God for the way He used Prophet T.B. Joshua in our lives.
    <br>We don't know where we would all be without him - we thank God for his life.
    <br>We thank God for the grace of knowing a man such as this.
    <br>I'd like to say thank you to the Lord for delivering this baby safely.
    <br>We are very blessed to have had this experience.
    <br>And I want to thank God for putting Prophet T.B. Joshua in our lives,
    <br>that he could guide us on every step on the way,
    <br>that he always stays with us in prayers as a prayer partner.
    <br>We thank God for the privilege and grace to be able to have that in our lives.
    <br>Like the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua likes to say,
    <br>he himself is not the healer, he knows the Healer; His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>And for the Holy Spirit, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Just like we received our miracle, you can receive your own.
    <br>Keep on watching Emmanuel TV!
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>But this miracle is not just for them - it is also meant to inspire your faith and thanksgiving
    <br>that no matter the obstacles on the way, no matter the situation you find yourself in,
    <br>there is hope, and His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Be confident that with God all things are possible.
    <br>God's time is the best and everything is beautiful in God's time.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>These are my parents - Annette and Ryan Van Zyl.
    <br>They joined us to come and present baby Abraham to the people of God,
    <br>to the man of God and to celebrate the miracle that God has done in our lives.
    <br>The problem that brought us to The SCOAN was among others, the problem of barrenness.
    <br>By God's grace, the man of God prayed for us at the Fruit Of The Womb Meeting
    <br>and he set us free from our problems.
    <br>My wife was booked for an operation because of some problem with her womb
    <br>and I was suffering from low sperm count for more than ten years.
    <br>Here we are presenting to you - baby Abraham.
    <br>Glory be to Jesus!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>As my husband has said, my name is Gene Van Zyl and this is baby Abraham.
    <br>We are so thrilled today to thank God, to be here with our own baby.
    <br>God has done for us what no man can do.
    <br>We have come from South Africa especially with our parents
    <br>just to say thank You to the Lord for what He has done in our lives.
    <br>We were here on a visit to The SCOAN
    <br>and without putting that we were seeking the fruit of the womb on our prayer request,
    <br>the man of God called us into his office, as we were returning to South Africa,
    <br>and handed us that baby book which my husband is holding
    <br>and told us that we should hold on to this book and that we would soon be expecting our own.
    <br>He also later confirmed before the time that the baby we would expecting
    <br>would be a baby boy.
    <br>As I said we came to The Fruit Of The Womb Meeting.
    <br>We were here for the service and on Sunday we were placed in the prayer line
    <br>and we were blessed on that Sunday to receive altar fruit from the man of God
    <br>and that brought our breakthrough.
    <br>Shortly after the meeting in December 2008, we returned home
    <br>and we met as husband and wife.
    <br>In February 2009, I started feeling certain changes.
    <br>I went for a blood test and to the glory of God I was pregnant.
    <br>I was very excited.
    <br>So, we came back here to testify later on about the pregnancy
    <br>and now we are here to thank God for what He has done in our lives.
    <br>Women who have the same problem that I have had and men who have
    <br>the same problem my husband had, you must trust God and wait for God's time.
    <br>With God all things are possible.
    <br>If God could do this for us, there is no one that God cannot do this for.
    <br>By God's grace, from watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>I can say today that I have learnt that in our spiritual walk with the Lord
    <br>we have both good and hard times alike.
    <br>We as Christians, should learn to embrace our hard times.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>By God's grace, we promise to train baby Abraham in the way of the Lord
    <br>and we ask the man of God never to cease in praying for us
    <br>and to carry on pointing us to our future success.
    <br>What shall we say unto the Lord
    <br>All we have to say is thank You Lord
    <br>Thank You Lord
    <br>All we have to say is thank You Lord
    <br>What shall we say unto the Lord
    <br>All we have to say is thank You Lord
    <br>Thank You Lord
    <br>All we have to say is thank You Lord
    <br>Jesus is the mighty God
    <br>All powers bow before Him
    <br>He's the mighty God
    <br>When Jesus says yes
    <br>No man can say no
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
    <br>To the glory of God, as the years rolled by, baby Abraham who was once just a prayer on his parent's lips,
    <br>grew to become a handsome young boy.
    <br>Let us listen to the family testify further about the goodness of God in their lives.
    <br>Good morning, viewers.
    <br>My name is Peter Van Zyl from South Africa.
    <br>I'm sure you've seen the testimony about the marvellous job God Almighty has done in our lives
    <br>with our son, Abraham.
    <br>I'm here to tell you that God even blessed us with another son five years later.
    <br>We named him Pieter.
    <br>Good morning. I'm Abraham. I'm 10 years old now and this is my little brother.
    <br>My name is Pieter and I'm 5 years old.
    <br>We are Emmanuel TV kids.
    <br>Good bye!
    <br>HOW GOD GAVE US A BABY AFTER TEN YEARS OF BARRENNESS!!!
