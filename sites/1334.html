    <br>There is a woman over there, a little child died mistakenly.
    <br>The child was sick and you went to a local chemist to buy some tablets.
    <br>These tablets resulted to death and the thing became a controversy.
    <br>and the Lord saved you out of it.
    <br>Later, you left the place.
    <br>I'm telling you, you are facing the spirit of death.
    <br>You keep seeing this child and some dead people in your dream.
    <br>A light in complexion woman, tall, stand up among the newcomers.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>The man of God said the woman he is referring to is among the newcomers.
    <br>You can see - this is the newcomers' section.
    <br>The Book of 2 Peter 1:21 says, for prophecy never had its origin in the will of man
    <br>but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>No, that is for Jesus!
    <br>That is for Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>That is for Jesus! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You for the revelation!
    <br>This is for Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You for the revelation!
    <br>I am a servant and I am sent to deliver you.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Let's listen to Mrs Gloria Okhae as she testifies to the goodness of God in her life.
    <br>I am Gloria Okhae.
    <br>I am from Edo State.
    <br>I came to Lagos because I was pursued by forces of death.
    <br>I came and met my sister - she stays in Lagos here.
    <br>I told her about my problem.
    <br>I told my sister how I see death.
    <br>She asked, "Is it when you are sleeping?"; I said, "No".
    <br>I said, "As I am talking to you now, I can see them. They are surrounding me.
    <br>I also hear strange voices telling me that my time is up.
    <br>In my dream, I saw this man of God; I have never met him before.
    <br>I told my sister, "I want to visit The SCOAN".
    <br>One of her sons brought me here. That was my first time.
    <br>I came with a catalogue of problems.
    <br>I don't even know where to start from because what I'm seeing is unusual.
    <br>It is abnormal.
    <br>Nobody sees it; only me.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN and I was sitting among the newcomers.
    <br>Suddenly, there was a prophecy that described my situation.
    <br>There is a woman over there, a little child died mistakenly.
    <br>The child was sick and you went to a local chemist to buy some tablets.
    <br>These tablets resulted to death and the thing became a controversy.
    <br>and the Lord saved you out of it.
    <br>Later, you left the place.
    <br>I'm telling you, you are facing the spirit of death.
    <br>You keep seeing this child and some dead people in your dream.
    <br>A light in complexion woman, tall, stand up among the newcomers.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>The man of God said the woman he is referring to is among the newcomers.
    <br>You can see - this is the newcomers' section.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>He said, "There is a woman here, you are fair in complexion and tall".
    <br>Some time ago, you went to a local chemist to purchase
    <br>some tablets for a little child that died mistakenly through you".
    <br>The prophecy referred to me; it described my situation.
    <br>He went further to say that ever since then,
    <br>I have been faced with the spirit of death.
    <br>I came out to confirm the prophecy because it described my situation.
    <br>What the man of God said was actually true.
    <br>The child in question was my husband's son.
    <br>He fell sick so I ran to a local chemist to buy some tablets.
    <br>I never knew that the drugs were fake.
    <br>A few hours later, this child died and I was accused.
    <br>There was a commotion. That eventually sent me out of my matrimonial home.
    <br>After some time, I was being confronted with death.
    <br>I kept seeing this child in my dream and some other dead people.
    <br>When I go to the market, what I see is death.
    <br>When I'm in the house, death.
    <br>When I'm eating, death. When I'm in the bathroom, death.
    <br>I keep seeing dead people.
    <br>Even when I'm in the car, the people in the car will suddenly turn into dead people.
    <br>It has been a life of living among the dead.
    <br>Do you mean you see them physically?
    <br>Yes
    <br>How do they look like?
    <br>They look like normal human beings but I know that they are dead.
    <br>How do you know that they are dead?
    <br>Because they are familiar dead people that I know are dead.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>When I'm in the market and want to buy something from somebody,
    <br>before I get there, the person might be looking normal.
    <br>but suddenly the person will just change into a dead person I know.
    <br>Then, I will leave.
    <br>I will not be able to buy what I wanted to buy.
    <br>If I want to eat, I will see dead people who want to eat with me,
    <br>then I will be afraid; I will not eat.
    <br>So, I was growing skinny.
    <br>The moment they appear, I will drop the food.
    <br>Why?
    <br>I don't want to eat with the dead.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>Can you remember the very day you started seeing these people?
    <br>It started in the dream.
    <br>- In the dream?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>When I see dead people in my dream and wake up, I would say, "This dream, I bind you!"
    <br>I would begin to bind.
    <br>I would say, "Thank God it is a dream".
    <br>But very soon, I would now see them in the physical.
    <br>What of that child that died?
    <br>I was seeing him and some other dead people.
    <br>They would show me time and tell me that my time is up.
    <br>When I entered a vehicle, the people would be normal people.
    <br>But as soon as I sat down and looked again, I saw dead people.
    <br>As I was coming here, they were following me.
    <br>But when they got to the gate, they could not enter.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>When I was delivered last Sunday, I said, "Let me put my faith to test".
    <br>I went to the shop in the church.
    <br>I asked the woman to give me some snacks and a soft drink.
    <br>I came inside the church; I took it.
    <br>I was watching to see whether there would be any negative reaction.
    <br>I didn't see dead people.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>I went home; I was happy.
    <br>Then I told my sister about it.
    <br>"Maybe it was because I was inside the church.
    <br>So get me my food and let me see if there will be some faces."
    <br>I put my food down; I was watching because they would normally come.
    <br>In fact, death was haunting me.
    <br>I was dying and nobody could understand me.
    <br>One doctor told me that my case was beyond medical intervention.
    <br>Then another woman told me that I needed crusade anointing to get out of this problem.
    <br>I put my food down and was watching to see if there was any reaction.
    <br>I didn't see anything.
    <br>The SCOAN Service
    <br>So, I ate my meal.
    <br>When it was time to sleep - the dead people would normally come
    <br>and say, "There will be no sleep for you; it is death!"
    <br>I lay down; I slept for the first time in my life for many years.
    <br>I slept. In fact, I didn't turn.
    <br>My sister said that she came to see whether I was sleeping.
    <br>She discovered that I was sleeping.
    <br>In fact, I slept.
    <br>Since the deliverance, it has been a life of glorious liberty.
    <br>No more death!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Jesus Christ has set Mrs Gloria free from the spirit of death.
    <br>The problem had tormented her for many years.
    <br>When your problem has advanced beyond the power of nature, it has become a curse.
    <br>Now, who else can remove a curse except God?
    <br>Who else can justly deliver?
    <br>It is none other than our Lord Jesus Christ.
