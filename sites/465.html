    <br>The SECRET Behind MIRACLES | TB Joshua
    <br>Who is like You Lord in all the earth
    <br>Matchless love and beauty endless worth
    <br>Nothing in this world can satisfy
    <br>Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Treasure of my heart and of my soul
    <br>In my weakness You are merciful
    <br>Redeemer of my past and present wrongs
    <br>Holder of my future days to come
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>There's nothing like Your presence
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Your presence is Heaven.
    <br>Are you feeling the presence?
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Viewers at home - Jesus's presence is Heaven.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>BELIEF IN OUR HEART
    <br>Let's take our reading from the Book of Romans 10.
    <br>I will take the reading from verse 1, before  we finally go to the proof text.
    <br>"Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites
    <br>is that they may be saved."
    <br>That is salvation.
    <br>"For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God,
    <br>but their zeal is not based on knowledge."
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Just like many of us; their zeal is not based on the knowledge of Spirit.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>"Since they did not know the righteousness of God
    <br>and sought to establish their own,"
    <br>Take note of that; they say, "since they do not know the righteousness".
    <br>What is righteousness?
    <br>With the heart, man believes that Jesus is his righteousness.
    <br>But they do not know this.
    <br>There is nothing like "heart" on the written pages in the books - that is their belief.
    <br>What is God's righteousness?
    <br>It is a gift from God, which is opposite to self-righteousness.
    <br>"I'm this, I'm that, I'm born again..."
    <br>God's righteousness boasts in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ
    <br>while self-righteousness boasts in itself.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>... while self-righteousness boasts in itself.
    <br>God's righteousness, which is a gift from above,
    <br>boasts in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's go to the proof text of today's message; verse 9.
    <br>This is where we are going now.
    <br>"If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord', and believe in your heart
    <br>that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."
    <br>There are two channels: with mouth and with the heart - lead to salvation.
    <br>"and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved."
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Let's go to 1 John.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>1 John 5:13.
    <br>I will take verse 13, which is related to what we are talking about.
    <br>"I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God
    <br>so that you may know that you have eternal life.
    <br>This is the confidence we have in approaching God."
    <br>I want to leave you there.
    <br>This is where we are going now.
    <br>This is the confidence we have in approaching God.
    <br>If you believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord, you are saved.
    <br>In that 1 John 5:13, they say "eternal" - that is the promise - eternal life.
    <br>He who believes has eternal life.
    <br>The Spirit can only show us that believing is possessing.
    <br>The instant you believe, you have.
    <br>This is why the Bible is talking about mouth-heart.
    <br>Our spirits act upon the Word to declare this.
    <br>How?
    <br>This means the Spirit will release...
    <br>If the Spirit is not released, the Word is today's language.
    <br>If the Spirit is not joined to yours, your words are today's language.
    <br>We use today's language to gossip, to talk to our children,
    <br>do business and politics, sing songs, give orders and directives.
    <br>"No, go this way, go that way!" -
    <br>you know how many people you have given orders to today before coming here.
    <br>"Look, I'm going to church. You must see that man before I come back from the church today."
    <br>I believe it is not the language of the Bible, of the Scripture.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>The power that flows from His name, the name Jesus,
    <br>will be in proportion to our love for His Word.
    <br>It is the Word dwelling in you which is equivalent
    <br>to Christ personally being in you.
    <br>The Word dominating you is the Lordship of Christ in you.
    <br>I keep asking God many questions in my prayer.
    <br>There are some so worrying.
    <br>People are asking me, "Why miracles, why healing, why professing are not happening everywhere?"
    <br>Yes.
    <br>God is going to withhold the phenomenon of signs and wonders
    <br>from the church until two things join, (coalesce).
    <br>What are the two things?
    <br>The Word and the Spirit.
    <br>You can be sound in doctrine and be lost.
    <br>You can know the Word and be lost and not be converted.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>It is possible to be sound in doctrine, to know the Word of God and be lost.
    <br>Our spirits act upon the Word.
    <br>Open your Bible to 1 Thessalonians 1:5
    <br>and also the Book of 1 Corinthians 2:4.
    <br>In that 1 Corinthians 2:4 it says,
    <br>"My preaching and teaching were not only with words but also with
    <br>a demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost."
    <br>When you are calling the name Jesus, it is the Word dominating you
    <br>which is equivalent to Christ personally being in you, that you are calling.
    <br>The Word dominating you is the Christ you are calling.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The Word dominating you is the Christ you are calling.]
    <br>When you just sit down and say, "In the name of Jesus!" - what do you have?
    <br>There must be an indwelling Word.
    <br>If there is no indwelling Word and you are calling the name Jesus, you are calling Him in vain.
    <br>There must be what?
    <br>Indwelling Word,
    <br>which is equivalent to Christ's personal being.
    <br>If there is no indwelling Word and you are calling the name Jesus - dangerous mission.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>Jesus will not come to the scene if His Word does not dominate or rule you.
    <br>Open the Book of Acts 20:32.
    <br>God commends us to the Word of His grace.
    <br>This Word builds the Christ's nature and love nature into individuals.
    <br>In other words, God is building Himself into us, making Himself a part of us,
    <br>as the Word dominates, rules and sanctifies our spirit nature.
    <br>The power that flows from His name will be in proportion to your love for His Word.
    <br>When that love is expressed, don't be surprised to see things change,
    <br>things loosed and things bound.
    <br>"Be healed, in Jesus' name!" -
    <br>if the person is healed, you realise the presence of God, power of resurrection, lightening of God.
    <br>"Be healed!"
    <br>The power that flows from His name will be in proportion to our love for His Word.
    <br>When that love is expressed, don't be surprised to see things change;
    <br>don't be surprised to see signs and wonders.
    <br>The Spirit I'm talking about - where our spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence of His Word.
    <br>Our spirits act upon the Word.
    <br>You keep asking yourself, "What is the Spirit? What is the Word?"
    <br>If that Spirit is not released, what you are saying is today's language.
    <br>Many say, "In the name of Jesus! Be healed! Be delivered!" -
    <br>ignorantly, they don't know they are speaking today's language.
    <br>Many would say, "Jesus is Lord! Amen!
    <br>I'm telling you; if you believe Jesus..."
    <br>They will quote Bible from Genesis to Revelation;
    <br>ignorantly, they don't know they are speaking today's language.
    <br>You will concord, "Yes, he is saying the truth" but the truth cannot penetrate your heart.
    <br>The truth that cannot heal, deliver, save - can we regard it as truth?
    <br>It is a fake, a photocopy truth.
    <br>When you have a photocopy of a document - you keep copying...
    <br>You can still read it, but as time goes on, it will...
    <br>He that believes has eternal life.
    <br>How can I believe in my heart?
    <br>You can believe when you not only hear the Word in your ears but also in your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You can believe in your heart when you not only hear the Word with your ears
    <br>but also in your heart.
    <br>How do we hear the Word in our heart?
    <br>Today, many of you hear me only with your ears, "Yes, I can hear you"
    <br>but you are not hearing me with your heart.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>It is possible to be sound in doctrine and be lost.
    <br>You can know the Word and never be converted.
    <br>God says He is going to withhold the phenomenon of signs and wonders
    <br>from the church people until two things (coalesce) join, combine, agree, act -
    <br>the Word and the Spirit; I mean, the Scripture and the power of God.
    <br>In other words, you can call it...
    <br>The Word and the name of God must remarry.
    <br>With this, you can know if you are saved.
    <br>I receive a lot of emails; let me just summarise what people say.
    <br>They say, "Why is your message always different from what we used to hear?"
    <br>What I'm doing is what I'm explaining to you.
    <br>Any moment from now you will see prophecy, prophetic Word in the lives of people.
    <br>I should be able to explain what I'm doing now.
    <br>Any moment from now, you will see people being delivered, "I'm this...".
    <br>Should I be able to explain...?
    <br>The SECRET Behind MIRACLES | TB Joshua
    <br>We are saved by a Gospel that tells us that Jesus Christ died on the Cross
    <br>for our sins and rose from the dead.
    <br>Hearing this word and embracing it by faith, that is what saves us.
    <br>The blood He shed on the Cross of Calvary is the most precious commodity
    <br>in the history of humankind.
    <br>The SECRET Behind MIRACLES | TB Joshua
    <br>The blood our Saviour shed on the Cross of Calvary is the most precious
    <br>commodity in the history of humankind.
    <br>The blood He dripped from His hands, His feet and His head.
    <br>The blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>Oh the blood of Jesus
    <br>It washes white as snow
    <br>Oh the blood of Jesus
    <br>It washes white as snow
    <br>Oh the blood of Jesus
    <br>It washes white as snow
    <br>Oh the blood of Jesus
    <br>It washes white as snow
    <br>Oh the blood of Jesus
    <br>It washes white as snow
    <br>Oh the blood of Jesus
    <br>It washes white as snow
    <br>Oh the blood of Jesus
    <br>It washes white as snow
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>Let's open our Bible to the Book of Acts 20:32.
    <br>"Now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace,
    <br>which can build you up and give you an inheritance
    <br>among all those who are sanctified."
    <br>We are saved by the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ that tells us that
    <br>Jesus died on the Cross for our sins and rose again from death.
    <br>Hearing this Word and embracing it by faith is what saves us.
    <br>The blood Jesus shed on the Cross of Calvary has no comparison.
    <br>It cannot be compared with anything.
    <br>It cannot be compared with your blood and the blood of the whole world.
    <br>It is the most precious commodity in the history of humankind.
    <br>The blood that dripped from His hands, feet and head
    <br>is the most precious commodity in the history of mankind.
    <br>Hearing this Word and embracing it by faith - you will be saved.
    <br>Remember, Christ dwells in our heart through faith.
    <br>The Word dominating you is what you are calling
    <br>when you say, "In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>The Word dominating you is what you are calling.
    <br>And if you cannot hear anything, know that the Word of God is not yet dominating you.
    <br>If I'm talking to you, let me see your hand.
    <br>In that verse 32 he said,
    <br>"I commit you to the word of His grace."
    <br>This Word builds Christ's nature and love nature into individuals.
    <br>In other words, God is building Himself into us, making Himself a part of us,
    <br>as the Word dominates, rules and sanctifies our spirit nature.
    <br>The power that flows from His name will be in proportion to our love for His Word.
    <br>That is when you say, "In the name of Jesus Christ!"...
    <br>There is wonderful name Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>There is wonderful name - Jesus!
    <br>The power that flows from His name will be in proportion to our love for His Word.
    <br>When that love is expressed...
    <br>That is why they say it is the love of Christ that heals, blesses.
    <br>If one is not "love", one cannot be entrusted with this grace.
    <br>When you say, "In the name of Jesus!" and nothing is released,
    <br>it means the Word dominating you is dormant, incapable of releasing.
    <br>If somebody is telling you, "He performs miracles, he doesn't preach"...
    <br>When you preach, Jesus will come into the scene.
    <br>When Jesus comes into the scene, He performs miracles.
    <br>When Jesus comes into the scene, signs and wonders follow.
    <br>There is power in our mouth.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith out of our mouth.
    <br>If there is power in our mouth, everyone has power then.
    <br>If you have not realised your power, it means the proportion of your love
    <br>for His Word cannot release the power.
    <br>It is as a result of the proportion of your love for His Word
    <br>that causes you to be powerless.
    <br>Like I have told you about the Spirit, every attempt...
    <br>Before you raise up your hand, "In the... " - who do you want to call?
    <br>Is it your father who is at home, your cousin, uncle, grandfather, Joshua, your junior brother?
    <br>It is none of your relatives, your brother or father...
    <br>It is Someone that is not even existing in flesh and blood:
    <br>God is Spirit.
    <br>The SECRET Behind MIRACLES | TB Joshua
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>If that name exists in the spirit, you need the suggestion of the Spirit to call the name.
    <br>You need Spirit's suggestion to call the name.
    <br>Before you say, "In the name of Jesus", there must be a suggestion
    <br>from the Spirit that you should call the name.
    <br>If not, and you call that name, you are only attracting or causing unnecessary attack.
    <br>We can lie in the physical realm and say, "I'm this and that" but judgement is in the dream.
    <br>Shortly after you leave, those people come.
    <br>They see a big cross you wear while sleeping, and your Bible is very big.
    <br>Even in front of your house there is a signboard that says, "Touch not my anointed and do him no harm".
    <br>Ogbanje (witch) does not know that - if truly you are not genuine.
    <br>You put that signboard and cross.
    <br>You even drop the blood of Jesus, that blood that dripped from the head -
    <br>when people see it, they are afraid.
    <br>Some people even put Bible in the room and sleep.
    <br>If that name is not in your heart...
    <br>The Bible says Christ dwells in our heart through faith.
    <br>Can you imagine what I'm talking about?
    <br>But if the Word dominates in your heart; when they come, that Word will speak for you.
    <br>It is that Word that will cry, "In Jesus' name!"
    <br>You say, "Fire!", while you are sleeping.
    <br>"Fire of the Holy Ghost! In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>People will see you shouting in the dream, you will not know what you are saying.
    <br>You will say, "Stop that!" - you see them standing with guns in that vision.
    <br>If the Word is dominating you, you will speak fluently.
    <br>The SECRET Behind MIRACLES | TB Joshua
    <br>... without any resistance.
    <br>Come, uncle, with your Bible.
    <br>Let me give you a good example.
    <br>If the Word is dominating my brother, if the Word is dwelling in him,
    <br>that Word is equivalent to Christ's personal being, meaning he is Christ,
    <br>because the Bible says Christ dwells in our heart through faith.
    <br>It means you have Christ in your heart.
    <br>If you stretch your hand and say, "In the name of Jesus",
    <br>it is the Word that is dominating you that will come out
    <br>because it is equivalent to Christ's personal being.
    <br>The Bible says Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>If the Word is not dominating you and you are calling Christ,
    <br>you cannot bring Christ into the scene.
    <br>You will be calling Christ in vain.
    <br>This is exactly what happened to the seven sons of Sceva.
    <br>What is the way out, sir?
    <br>It is to heed to the Spirit of God.
    <br>How do we do that?
    <br>By studying the Word of God.
    <br>Not only studying the Word of God.
    <br>You may study the Word of God for years.
    <br>Not only you must hear the Word with your ear.
    <br>I'm sorry for touching your ear.
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>Am I permitted to touch your ear?
    <br>You are permitted, Prophet; that's my ear - I will be able to hear God.
    <br>The SECRET Behind MIRACLES | TB Joshua
    <br>Not only must you hear the Word with your ears...
    <br>I hope I'm not touching it too much.
    <br>It's OK.
    <br>... you must also hear the Word with your heart.
    <br>The question now:
    <br>How do we hear the Word with our heart?
    <br>Ask me.
    <br>How do we hear the Word with our heart?
    <br>We all know how to hear God's Word with our ears
    <br>but how do we hear God's Word with our heart?
    <br>To hear God's Word with our heart requires openness and hunger for God's Word.
    <br>If you put these two words together and you want to give just one meaning -
    <br>I will define those two words together in one sentence.
    <br>See God's Word as if your life depends on knowing it.
    <br>Indeed, our lives depend on knowing it.
    <br>Thank you.
