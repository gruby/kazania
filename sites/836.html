    <br>Viewers, whatever spirit that is causing you nightmares, failure, setback, barrenness -
    <br>I curse them in the name of Jesus!

    <br>Loose your grip, in the name of Jesus!

    <br>He is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>His Word never changes.
    <br>I send His Word from my heart to you:
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
