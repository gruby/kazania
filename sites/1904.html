    <br>Mr Kingsley has come to The SCOAN with inability to walk due to a fracture of the left acetabulum.
    <br>This is the medical report that states the diagnosis of his problem.
    <br>Here is a photo of Mr Kingsley's condition in the hospital after the accident that nearly took his life.
    <br>This is what remains of his vehicle after the accident; it has been completely written off.
    <br>When you look at the front of the vehicle, you can see that he was fortunate to even escape.
    <br>My brother cannot walk due to an accident.
    <br>Please, help me man of God!
    <br>Help me man of God, please!
    <br>WATCH BROKEN BONES COME BACK TOGETHER INSTANTLY!!!
    <br>Man of God, help me!
    <br>Man of God, help me, I cannot walk!
    <br>Due to a car accident.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Help me, man of God, my brother cannot walk!
    <br>Watch your screen; those are the relatives of that man inside the vehicle,
    <br>stretched out, without the ability to walk, due to an accident.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua walks to where Mr Kingsley waits inside the vehicle.
    <br>Immediately, he ministers prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, and Mr Kingsley's leg begins to react,
    <br>vibrating under the power of God.
    <br>You are witnessing divine healing taking place.
    <br>Incredibly, he begins to move his leg all by himself, as Prophet T.B. Joshua continues to pray for him.
    <br>This is something he was not able to do before the prayer.
    <br>Using his foot under the instruction of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>Prophet T.B.Joshua continues to minister prayer to Mr Kingsley.
    <br>Mr Kingsley's face says it all.
    <br>This is nothing but a miracle.
    <br>He gently places his feet outside the vehicle.
    <br>The resurrection power of the Holy Spirit is flowing through Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to meet the needs of Mr Kingsley, bringing back to life everything that was in a state of disuse.
    <br>This is live and direct from the prayer line of The SCOAN,
    <br>where Prophet T.B. Joshua is ministering healing.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Holy Spirit.
    <br>Lord, I thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I thank You, Almighty God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>WATCH BROKEN BONES COME BACK TOGETHER INSTANTLY!!!
    <br>See the brother walking without any need of support!
    <br>The brother could not walk before now, hallelujah!
    <br>WATCH BROKEN BONES COME BACK TOGETHER INSTANTLY!!!
    <br>Mr Kingsley, his family and visitors from all around the world
    <br>begin to celebrate the awesome miracle of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>WATCH BROKEN BONES COME BACK TOGETHER INSTANTLY!!!
    <br>Walking and even dancing in the light of his testimony,
    <br>the problem of inability to walk due to fracture of the left acetabulum is now a thing of the past.
    <br>Mr Kingsley rejoices with his family, as their impossibility has become possible.
    <br>The resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ is the joy of His friends.
    <br>Jesus was resurrected so that we might come to a place of resurrection in our spirit, soul and body.
    <br>Look at the joy on Mr Kingsley's face, as everything in his life has been resurrected
    <br>by the blood of Jesus Christ and the fire of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>This is the evidence of a life changed forever.

    <br>Praise the Lord! We are here at The SCOAN live Sunday Service
    <br>and wonderful things have happened in our midst just now.
    <br>My name is Annette and I am reporting for Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We have just seen a notable miracle take place before our eyes.
    <br>As the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for a man that could not walk,
    <br>we saw a current of resurrection power flowing through Prophet T.B. Joshua to meet the needs of this man.
    <br>We saw everything that was dead being resurrected in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>We saw sickness bow to that name, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Could you tell us your name, sir?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Kingsley Agiriga; I am from Imo State.
    <br>I had a motor accident; I could not walk.
    <br>According to the doctor, it was a spinal cord injury.
    <br>Everybody else died in the accident; you can see the pictures.
    <br>I'm the only survivor, I don't know why.
    <br>I know I'm a sinner but I'm living by His grace.
    <br>I thank God that I'm alive today.
    <br>They took me to several hospitals; I had wounds and a broken leg.
    <br>You can see the marks there.
    <br>Two of my ribs were broken.
    <br>My arm was broken.
    <br>My head was wounded.
    <br>I also injured my waist, the most dangerous one.
    <br>I thank God because it's by His grace I'm alive; I was unconscious for five days.
    <br>Due to the motor accident, I could not walk or do anything on my own.
    <br>It is only my sister and my mother that were helping me to the toilet,
    <br>anything I'm doing, even to bath me as old as I am.
    <br>When things got very bad for me, my sister said I should go to church, The SCOAN.
    <br>It was when my sister brought me to The SCOAN
    <br>that the man of God prayed for me on the prayer line.
    <br>To my great surprise, all the things I could not do before became possible.
    <br>I could not move my leg before, but after Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me
    <br>I felt sensations in my leg and was able to move it, whereas I could not move it before.
    <br>I said to myself that there was something happening in me.
    <br>Then the man of God asked me to stand up; I just stood up!
    <br>It's just by the grace of God that I'm walking now.
    <br>I praise God for this; the doctors have done their best but God has done it.
    <br>I have been healed freely; I believe God will do it for you too!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Hallelujah! There are not natural words to describe what has taken place just now.
    <br>There are some visitors here who want to show their appreciation of what God has done
    <br>because they have witnessed the Word of God alive in the Spirit.
    <br>Sir, could you come and tell us your name?
    <br>I am Pastor Henry Wilson from South Africa.
    <br>It's so wonderful to be here; it's amazing to sense the power and presence of God.
    <br>It's so real and we give God all the glory; He's the same yesterday, today and forevermore.
    <br>He's still the miracle worker, He's still the Healer - He's alive!
    <br>To God be the glory!
    <br>Amen! You can see our brother who was lying down in the car unable to walk
    <br>but you saw the glory of God, what God has done through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What advice can you give to people out there?
    <br>I saw it with my own eyes.
    <br>It's not by might, it's not by power but by the Spirit of God.
    <br>My advice would be to trust God; Jesus is the Healer.
    <br>Have faith in God; He's a good God.
    <br>Amen, never a Healer like Jesus Christ!
    <br>Yes, sir, let us hear from you, please introduce yourself.
    <br>I'm Pastor Ben Jordaan from South Africa.
    <br>I'm so excited because I have seen the power of God, the fire of the Holy Spirit and no man can do this.
    <br>I give Jesus the praise!
    <br>Jesus says we will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon us
    <br>and I have seen that for real today, in the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>I give God the praise because the man was almost dead, he could not walk,
    <br>he almost could not move and all of a sudden, God's power came upon him and he is walking.
    <br>This is only Jesus Christ, hallelujah!
    <br>Amen, praise the Lord.
    <br>Yes, sir, please tell us your name.
    <br>I am Pastor Zachariah from South Africa.
    <br>Today, we witnessed the power of God in a mighty way.
    <br>I have never seen anything like this before.
    <br>This is my first time seeing such great works of God at The SCOAN.
    <br>This is powerful!
    <br>For those who have never come, come and see the greatness of God;
    <br>it's happening in Lagos, Nigeria, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen, I think we have some more people who want to testify to God's goodness.
    <br>Hello, I am Pastor Bernard from South Africa.
    <br>We saw the power of God; God is really amongst the people here.
    <br>The resurrection power of Jesus Christ is what gave this man life in his legs.
    <br>It's just amazing to be a part of it and really see what God is doing here.
    <br>Trust in God for anything in your life and that resurrection power of Christ Jesus -
    <br>if He can do it for this man, He can do it for anybody else.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Five years later, Mr Kingsley Agiriga came back to The SCOAN to testify to the greatness of God in his life.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>WATCH BROKEN BONES COME BACK TOGETHER INSTANTLY!!!
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>These are dead bones living again!
    <br>My name is Kingsley Agiriga.
    <br>I'm a driver by profession.
    <br>I had an accident on the road in which many people died.
    <br>I didn't know what happened.
    <br>I was in a coma for five days.
    <br>It was a very terrible experience.
    <br>When the accident happened, I didn't know myself or what happened.
    <br>According to my sister, when they came to the hospital they were told
    <br>that the brother that was involved in an accident was the driver.
    <br>The police said the driver of the car had died.
    <br>They were then asked to go and see the car for the driver that died.
    <br>One man said that there was a man lying in the bed,
    <br>that they should go and check whether that was their brother.
    <br>So, my sister went there and said that the man was her brother.
    <br>The people were surprised and said that the driver had died
    <br>and asked if she was sure he was her brother, that she should check very well.
    <br>They said she should go to the mortuary but she had already gone and he was not there.
    <br>They then confirmed the man was me.
    <br>While I stayed in the hospital, the doctor confirmed I had a spinal cord problem,
    <br>waist problem, and a break in my hands, legs and ribs.
    <br>The doctors said I would undergo another operation in South Africa.
    <br>I was staying helpless in my house; my children were there but my sister was the one taking care of them.
    <br>She was the one taking care of me.
    <br>One day, my sister said we should go to The SCOAN.
    <br>We then came to The SCOAN and I was seated inside the vehicle.
    <br>The man of God was praying for other people and I was looking at him, wondering whether I would walk
    <br>because I knew I didn't have any strength at that time, even to move my leg.
    <br>I was meditating and saying God, everyone had received their healing, God, let me receive mine.
    <br>When the man of God came and touched me, I had been doubting so much.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, my body started shaking.
    <br>A voice told me to sit up and I did so
    <br>and another voice told me to stand up so that I could see whether I could walk.
    <br>Immediately, my legs were shaking and I stood up.
    <br>As I stood another voice said that couldn't I move, even if I fell the man of God was watching me.
    <br>I just moved - not only to move, but the idea came that I should start running!
    <br>Everyone was watching and if I could not run well, they would then heal me very well here.
    <br>WATCH BROKEN BONES COME BACK TOGETHER INSTANTLY!!!
    <br>That was how I started running; that day was my day.
    <br>Today, you can see that I can walk.
    <br>I thank God for this testimony on this glorious day in my life.
    <br>My advice to people like me, like Thomas in those days, don't doubt that God is real.
    <br>My experiences are what nobody among you will have.
    <br>I know that God who has given me a new bone to walk will never leave me.
    <br>I will live for Him forever.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>'Thank You, Jesus Christ' is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>Look at the joy of the Lord as Mr Kingsley demonstrates the perfect healing he received five years ago.
    <br>Mr Kingsley is living proof that when Jesus Christ enters your life,
    <br>He puts an end to your past and He gives birth to a glorious future in Him.
    <br>A million thanks are not enough to express what Jesus Christ has done in his life.
