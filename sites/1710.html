  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This is a wonderful atmosphere!
    <br>Let us continue the journey just like that.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Our prayer point shall be found in Matthew 8:26.
    <br>It is a prophetic message for you and I.
    <br>Matthew 8:26: "...He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm."
    <br>There was a great calm.
    <br>Right now, begin to rebuke the winds and the waves, to command calmness in your life.
    <br>Open your lips now - begin to rebuke the winds and the waves, to command calmness in your life.
    <br>Right now, open your lips, begin to rebuke the waves - all trouble, those challenges.

    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I decree calmness in your spiritual life!
    <br>Whatever hindrance, whatever challenges; you know the kind of life you have been living.
    <br>You don't understand your dreams - always nightmares.
    <br>Even many will say they don't dream.
    <br>I don't know how a human being will live without dreaming.
    <br>You say, "I don't dream," and if they dream, they don't understand their dream.
    <br>These are challenges in your spiritual life.
    <br>Open your lips now:
    <br>You storm in my business, in my career, be calm!
    <br>Prayer!
