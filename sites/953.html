  <p>    
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>On Sunday 31st of August 2014, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophecy
    <br>concerning a military intervention in a Southern African country.
    <br>Let us listen to his words.
    <br>A president will be kidnapped; I mentioned it.
    <br>I mean, Southern African people will remember,
    <br>if they are not going to misquote me this time.
    <br>But this time, what I'm saying now -
    <br>quote me well; don't misquote me.
    <br>I am seeing military - they are still on that plan
    <br>to kidnap either the President, or Vice President of that nation,
    <br>or the First Lady of that nation.
    <br>They are aiming to do that and they are still serious to do it.
    <br>The plan is going on now.
    <br>If prayer is not offered well, they will succeed.
    <br>If he refuses the order, they will kill him.
    <br>That is what I'm seeing.
    <br>They should pray for Southern Africa - a president.
    <br>God showed me the place but I don't want to put any country into pandemonium.
    <br>But Southern Africa - they should pray for them.
    <br>Pray for them; God loves them.
