  <p>    
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let us have a minute of silence for one of God's Generals, Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke.
    <br>A Minute Of Silence For
    <br>Evangelist Reinhard Bonnke
    <br>May his soul rest in perfect peace.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It's all about Jesus, not about T.B. Joshua
    <br>It's not about Reinhard Bonnke but it is all about Jesus.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I am here to receive the harvest you have been enjoying.
    <br>I know you are happy. How will I know you are happy?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ah!
    <br>How will I know you are saved?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ah!
    <br>How will I know you are blessed?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are not in a conference hall.
    <br>You are not in a meeting.
    <br>We are talking of things purely divine.
    <br>Ok, how will I know you are saved?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>How do we maintain all this?
    <br>If you don't maintain it, conductor can take it away from you.
    <br>Because temptation is everywhere.
    <br>The conductor will just tell you, "Come on, bring your money out. Where are you coming from?
    <br>Look at your beard, look at your stomach and I trust you".
    <br>You now say, "In the name of Jesus, you are talking to me like that".
    <br>Why should you use the name Jesus for conductor?
    <br>Is that not temptation? Talk to me.
    <br>It is awaiting.
    <br>Temptation is what? Awaiting.
    <br>How do we maintain all these blessings?
    <br>I know you are happy, healed, blessed, saved.
    <br>How do you maintain? Maintenance is more important.
    <br>Let me see your Bible because that is our standard.
    <br>Let me see your Bible.
    <br>Wow, different bibles.
    <br>Some raise literature.
    <br>Some raise laptop.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You can only maintain what you have received and the more you are about to receive
    <br>by God's Word and His Spirit.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Can I just ask one or two questions from one of us here?
    <br>Can you just tell me: How do you maintain all these abundant blessings you have now?
    <br>We maintain our blessing by the help of the Holy Spirit to live by the Word of God.
    <br>Ok, thank you. Hallelujah!
    <br>You need to read your Bible. You have to live in the Word
    <br>When you read your Bible, try not to concentrate on quantity but on quality.
    <br>Because many of you, you want to finish the Bible.
    <br>One year, how many passages, how many pages, how many this. That does not matter.
    <br>To live in the Word...
    <br>Speed reading can only be used for other subjects,
    <br>e.g History, Chemistry, Literature, etc.,
    <br>but never for divine truth, that is the Scripture.
    <br>To maintain your blessing today, read your Bible slowly, attentively
    <br>and repeatedly with forgiveness
    <br>because you need corresponding power to understand what you are reading.
    <br>When you look at 2 Peter 1:21,
    <br>"Holy men were carried along by the Holy Spirit as they spoke the message that came from..."
    <br>You need corresponding power to understand what you are reading.
    <br>That is why you must carry God along - the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Slowly, repeatedly, and attentively.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whereas when you read history, you are reading about events.
    <br>When you read the Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Holy Spirit
    <br>Take more of me
    <br>Give me more of You
    <br>Holy Spirit
    <br>Take more of me
    <br>Give me more of You forevermore
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You cannot be faster than the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The Holy Ghost leads while reading the Bible; you follow.
    <br>But today, you are the one leading and you want the Holy Ghost to follow you.
    <br>Whereas when you are reading the Bible, you are reading the Holy Ghost.
    <br>You are very educated, you can read your Bible, you understand. No, not that kind of understanding.
    <br>You must examine everything you read.
    <br>Examine what you are reading; don't read the literature, history of the Bible.
    <br>You know the history -
    <br>the father of this, the father of Elijah, the mother of this - that is the history part of it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is it. Simple!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where we have our challenges now is that corresponding power
    <br>that suggests the step to take,
    <br>that suggests the meaning of what we read,
    <br>that codes the Bible and decodes the Bible.
    <br>What you see as, "Go", by the time you let the Holy Spirit to explain, it will not be that, "Go".
    <br>It's an idiom, parable.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why we have to humble ourselves when it comes to the Bible.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Speed reading can be used for other subjects
    <br>but never for the Scripture.
    <br>You must read it attentively, slowly and repeatedly.
    <br>As you are reading, it is reading you. It is a Book that reads you while you read it.
    <br>It is a Book that looks at you when you look at it.
    <br>When you are reading the Bible, it is reading you too.
    <br>It is reading you - whether you have forgiven. It is a mirror.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Now you are blessed, you have to maintain your blessing.
    <br>Rise up for prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"I do not see satan from the physical; I see satan from the other side, the spirit world".
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[I do not see satan from the physical; I see satan from the other side, the spirit world.]
    <br>So therefore, when we want to pray, we need to do like this as if we see satan.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[I do not see satan from the physical; I see satan from the other side, the spirit world.]
    <br>That it is.
    <br>Sometimes, when I look at you people, I say,  "Will I stop you - it's a culture, it's a tradition".
    <br>We are trained like that - when it is time to pray.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I do not see satan from the physical, natural; I see satan from the other side, the spirit world.
    <br>There are three main spirits in the world: God's Spirit, satan's spirit and your spirit.
    <br>You are a free moral agent. You can yield either to God's Spirit or satan's.
    <br>So this is called faith, Christianity.
    <br>You don't know, you just wake up in the morning, you dress up,
    <br>the way you were brought up from the church.
    <br>The prayer you want to offer today, you have prepared it from home.
    <br>The sermon you want to deliver, you have prepared it from home. You were brought up in that way.
    <br>Sun in, sun out - it's in the hymn.
    <br>Conventional.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There are three main spirits in the world: God's Spirit, satan's spirit and your spirit.
    <br>You are a free moral agent.
    <br>You can yield yourself to either God's Spirit or to satan's.
    <br>God is Spirit, and His worshippers must worship Him in what? In Spirit.
    <br>You are fighting.
    <br>We are not fighting the flesh;
    <br>we are fighting the spirit beings that cause tension and pressure.
    <br>The pastor is praying, you may not even turn, you will be looking but your heart is...
    <br>Our heart is the prayer room.
    <br>Tell your neighbour
    <br>[Our heart is the prayer room.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Our heart is the prayer room.]
    <br>Ok, if your heart is the prayer room, what is the function of this one?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is the function?
    <br>Our heart is the prayer room.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again
    <br>[Our heart is the prayer room.]
    <br>So if you heart is the prayer room, what next?
    <br>Ask God to open your heart to His Spirit
    <br>because some hearts are locked,
    <br>because you don't have control of your heart.
    <br>Like we are here now, some hearts are, "When is T.B. Joshua finishing here today?"
    <br>And we are talking now and his heart is saying, "I think I am getting over.
    <br>We have community meeting. Let's see what is going to happen but I still have pain.
    <br>Will this man heal me? What is going to happen?"
    <br>While we are talking to you, your heart is also talking another thing.
    <br>You have no control of your heart.
    <br>Say:
    <br>Lord, open my heart to Your Spirit.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Lord, open my heart to Your Spirit.]
    <br>Are we not even ashamed to say that
    <br>when it is in our hearts and we are now asking God to help us open it.
    <br>We are now asking God to help us open it because it's locked.
    <br>As I'm talking now, there is a gentleman there that is saying, "This man, what is he saying?"
    <br>What am I saying? Why should anybody be saying that in the church here?
    <br>Because his heart is locked.
    <br>Say again:
    <br>Open my heart to Your Spirit.
    <br>If your heart is not open to His Spirit, nothing can be done - nothing can be achieved.
    <br>Right now, begin to ask God to remove every barrier between your heart and God's Spirit.
    <br>Open your lips. Prayer!
    <br>Every barrier between your heart and God's Spirit.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Because you may not even know what I'm talking about.
    <br>When I say barrier, it could be holding offence, having an unforgiving spirit,
    <br>pain of the past.
    <br>"That woman - I will never forgive."
    <br>Many of us here today - there are many people we have sentenced to prison
    <br>just because something happened - yes, they are wrong.
    <br>But it's not good for we Christians - somebody is in the prison because something happened.
    <br>Whether kill or steal or this and they got sentenced - such a person to prison and the person is in the prison.
    <br>As a Christian, you have to do something about it.
    <br>Barrier could be holding offence, having an unforgiving spirit,
    <br>pain of the past.
    <br>These are the barriers.
    <br>The Spirit of God wants a free spirit. If your heart is not free...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>A free spirit can attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>This is what I am asking you to remove now.
    <br>If there is any offence, unforgiving spirit, pain of the past -
    <br>here you can settle the matter.
    <br>When you leave, give a call to the fellow; settle the matter amicably.
    <br>That will not hold your prayer; rather God will grant you your prayer.
    <br>Right now, open your lips -
    <br>begin to remove every barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, every barrier between your heart and the Spirit of God -
    <br>I command that barrier to be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Sometimes you need help, you need deliverance to remove this.
    <br>Receive that deliverance, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command that barrier to be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That is salvation.
    <br>That is the greatest miracle.
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That barrier could be holding offence, having an unforgiving spirit,
    <br>pain of the past, hurt.
    <br>I command that barrier to be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>We are talking of fortification; we are talking of repentance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Here I am
    <br>Send me
    <br>If the Lord wants somebody
    <br>Here I am send me.
    <br>That's all.
    <br>You should be a channel of God -
    <br>a channel of love, a channel of humility, a channel of forgiveness,
    <br>a channel of pardon, a channel of faithfulness, a channel of obedience.
    <br>You should be.
    <br>Whenever you see me
    <br>Talk about Jesus!
    <br>He is the Owner of my soul
    <br>Whenever you see me
    <br>Talk about Jesus
    <br>He is the Owner of my soul
    <br>He is the owner
    <br>He is the Owner of my soul
    <br>He is the owner
    <br>He is the Owner of my soul
    <br>What is the meaning of this?
    <br>That is, whenever you see me, talk about love.
    <br>Whenever you see me, talk about humility.
    <br>Whenever you see me, talk about forgiveness.
    <br>Whenever you see me, talk about pardon, humility.
    <br>This is it.
    <br>You are leaving any moment from now.
    <br>Your Christian life should not be a part-time one; it should be full-time.
    <br>You have been living humility, love, kindness, goodness since morning.
    <br>I saw a woman somewhere of recent.
    <br>The woman bought a full plate of food, full of rice.
    <br>Somebody was just turning around and the plate fell - full of rice.
    <br>The woman said, "Don't worry".
    <br>And I know outside there, I trust the woman would remove her dress and say,
    <br>"This is my last" and call the police, court.
    <br>But that should continue, not only here - full-time, not part-time Christian.
    <br>Yes. Your behaviour today here, since morning, you have not been smoking.
    <br>Since morning, you have not been lying.
    <br>Since morning, you have not been taking alcohol.
    <br>You have been quiet and quiet and quiet.
    <br>Don't leave here and getting to your house, start a bad attitude.
    <br>Whenever you see me talk about Jesus
    <br>He is the Owner of my soul
    <br>He is the Owner
    <br>He is the Owner of my soul
    <br>He is the Owner
    <br>He is the Owner of my soul
    <br>This simply means, anywhere you are, you are a channel of love where there is hate.
    <br>You are a channel of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>You are a channel of pardon where there is injury, misuse, misjudgment.
    <br>You are a channel of humility where there is pride.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>You are a channel of forgiveness where there is sin.
    <br>Somebody wrongs you, you just say, "Hmm. Take care, don't worry".
    <br>That is it. Not just here in the church.
    <br>You have been very quiet, nice.
    <br>It should remain like that.
    <br>How to maintain our blessing:
    <br>The Lord has set a table before you; there is a table before you.
    <br>I'm just telling you what I have seen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>On the table are the essentials of life.
    <br>The essentials of life are on the table.
    <br>What else again?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>What shall I say unto the Lord
    <br>All I have to say is thank You Lord
    <br>Thank You Lord
    <br>All I have to say is thank You Lord
    <br>Faith is not imitation.
    <br>You want to shake before you know you are blessed.
    <br>You want to vomit when you see many people have vomited blood and all other.
    <br>But you keep asking yourself, "I have not vomited anything. Until I vomit..."
    <br>Even some people...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>Because of others you have seen - you see bleeding, the fibroid is coming out
    <br>you too have the same fibroid and you are expecting to have your own fibroid.
    <br>He does as He wills.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>He does as He wills.
    <br>Faith is not imitation.
    <br>It's not imitation.
    <br>He has a reason for leaving you with that pain
    <br>and He has a reason for releasing this man from that pain.
    <br>When He knows that releasing you from the pain, you will not be able to keep that blessing,
    <br>it will not strengthen your desire and determination for Him - no.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
