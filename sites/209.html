    <br>WATCH This Wound CLOSE After PRAYER...
    <br>You are very welcome to The SCOAN, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you please tell us your name?
    <br>My name is Mrs Margaret Onuwueliego. I am 28 years old.
    <br>What is the problem that has brought you here, to The SCOAN?
    <br>The problem that has brought me here is an abdominal ulcer due to operation.
    <br>It is due to the baby I had; the baby died in the womb so they had to remove the baby.
    <br>How have you been feeling? What are your experiences?
    <br>I mean, how did these problems affect your daily activities?
    <br>I am having pain all over and I am weak.
    <br>I cannot do anything on my own without the assistance of people.
    <br>I have taken a lot of drugs and I have been to the hospital.
    <br>So, there is no solution and I had to come.
    <br>How did you come to find out about The SCOAN?
    <br>It is my husband that brought me.
    <br>Now that you are here at The SCOAN, what do you believe that God Almighty will do for you?
    <br>I believe that there is nothing God cannot do.
    <br>I am believing God for healing.
    <br>She explains that because her baby died in the womb, she had to undergo an operation to take the baby out.
    <br>After the operation, the wound did not heal and the stitches came apart.
    <br>They made several attempts to restitch the wound, but all to no avail,
    <br>as each time they tried the stitching would come loose, and the ulcer would become worse.
    <br>She is here at The SCOAN for divine intervention for her problem.
    <br>My baby died in the womb so they had to operate to remove it.
    <br>Ever since, the wound did not close and heal.
    <br>They tried to stitch it but something will not hold.
    <br>They tried to cover the wound but there was no way.
    <br>It has become a curse and who can remove the curse? Nobody.
    <br>Jesus Christ.
    <br>When your problem becomes a curse, doctors will tell you that there is nothing they can do.
    <br>C U R S E - curse.
    <br>Who can remove the curse? Nobody but Jesus Christ.
    <br>WATCH This Wound CLOSE After PRAYER...
    <br>Doctors must have been solving different problems but this kind is a curse.
    <br>Father, thank You, Lord.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>WATCH This Wound CLOSE After PRAYER...
    <br>T.B. Joshua, under the check and conduct of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>stretches forth his hand over Mrs Margaret to declare healing,
    <br>in the powerful name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>After the prayer of T.B. Joshua, she is free from the abdominal ulcer.
    <br>She testifies waving her hands to the glory of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>A Few Weeks Later
    <br>Before | Now
    <br>A few weeks later Mrs Margaret came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to give the full testimony of her complete healing from the problem of abdominal ulcer.
    <br>Let's hear from her.
    <br>I am okay.
    <br>- Do you have any pain?
    <br>- No.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>When you have an encounter with Jesus Christ, your sickness will be swallowed up in perfect health.
    <br>Glory be to God.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>As Mrs Margaret came forward to give her testimony,
    <br>friends, family and well-wishers from her home town joined her
    <br>to give thanks to God for healing her from the problem that had tormented her for so many years.
    <br>Madam, we welcome you to The SCOAN today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Can you tell us your name, your age, where you come from and your wonderful testimony?
    <br>My name is Mrs Margaret Onuwueliego.
    <br>I came from Cross River State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was abdominal cancer.
    <br>Last year on the 30th of December, I had my baby
    <br>but I never knew that my baby died in the womb.
    <br>So, they did an operation.
    <br>After the operation, my wound could not heal.
    <br>I took so many medications but all to no avail.
    <br>Each time the doctor stitched it, the stitching would lose its hold.
    <br>That was how it continued. I could not sleep.
    <br>I could not do anything without the assistance of the doctors and nurses.
    <br>My husband brought me to The SCOAN.
    <br>That day I was in the prayer line.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua saw it, he said this wound has been cursed, that it is only Jesus Christ that can heal it.
    <br>My baby died in the womb so they had to operate it.
    <br>Ever since, it refused to stitch.
    <br>They tried to stitch it but something would not hold.
    <br>They tried to cover the wound but there was no way.
    <br>It has become a curse and who can remove the curse? Nobody.
    <br>Jesus Christ.
    <br>He stretched forth his hand and declared healing.
    <br>From that day, I started experiencing my healing.
    <br>A few days after the healing, I could move, shake, jump and turn.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus once again?
    <br>WATCH This Wound CLOSE After PRAYER...
    <br>So madam, we rejoice with you greatly for this wonderful testimony.
    <br>We just want to ask you one or two questions.
    <br>When you saw your abdomen, what did you used to think each time you saw this sore?
    <br>You woke up in the morning and you looked at the sore,
    <br>and going by the fact that the doctors had tried and there was no way out -
    <br>what did you used to think, what were your thoughts then?
    <br>I knew I was going to die.
    <br>- You thought you were going to die?
    <br>- Yes. I knew it already.
    <br>If not for God, I could have be in the grave now.
    <br>But Jesus Christ delivered me.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus.
    <br>Madam, we rejoice with you for what the Lord has done in your life.
    <br>Can you tell us what advice you have for people all around the world?
    <br>I just want them to believe in God, to have faith and to trust in God.
    <br>There is nothing God cannot do. With Him, all things are possible.
    <br>WATCH This Wound CLOSE After PRAYER...
    <br>We rejoice with you, sir.
    <br>Can you tell us your name and what you have to say about your wife's testimony?
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Nnamdi Onuwueliego. I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my wife.
    <br>The problem that brought her here was the problem of abdominal ulcer
    <br>through the operation she went through when she was about to have her baby.
    <br>They operated on her and the tummy could not heal.
    <br>When it became worse, the doctor had to call us that this thing is much,
    <br>and it is something that he cannot help anymore.
    <br>The doctor was afraid.
    <br>He thought my wife was going to die and was trying to discharge us.
    <br>I said he should allow her to stay because
    <br>if I took her home and she died, they would say that I did not take care of her.
    <br>I said that it is better for her to die in the hospital.
    <br>How do you feel now, as a husband, seeing your wife healed of this very problem,
    <br>which you thought was going to kill her? How do you feel today?
    <br>I am happy.
    <br>We can see a crowd of people all around you. What do you have to say about them?
    <br>They are all my people. They came in respect of this very testimony we are here for today.
    <br>Let's clap for wonderful Jesus.
    <br>Can we just hear from one person who can speak on behalf of all the members of the family -
    <br>the reason why they are all here?
    <br>My name is Patrick Jacob Udam.
    <br>I am from Cross River State, Nigeria.
    <br>She is my immediate younger sister.
    <br>I used to be a very feeble-hearted person, though I am a man.
    <br>It was my mum that narrated it to all of us because she was in the hospital with her.
    <br>I told my mum that I don't think I will be able to look at that wound because if I do I might pass out immediately.
    <br>I just saw how the thing was now on the TV.
    <br>Sincerely speaking, it is amazing to know that God indeed works
    <br>through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus?
    <br>WATCH This Wound CLOSE After PRAYER...
    <br>With the situation she was in initially, sincerely speaking,
    <br>I have nothing to say now, other than to give glory to the Almighty God for saving her life.
    <br>We used to hear about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>This is my first time of coming to The SCOAN.
    <br>We came to The SCOAN just to thank God for what God has done in the life of our sister here.
    <br>I have been here since morning and with the things I have seen, even with the situation of my sister inclusive,
    <br>I know that God indeed works with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>WATCH This Wound CLOSE After PRAYER...
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Thank you very much, sir, for taking your time to join your younger sister for her wonderful testimony.
    <br>We believe that this testimony will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>To God be the glory. So, right now, without further ado,
    <br>we believe our choristers are eagerly waiting to sing a wonderful song...
    <br>Everybody testifies You are good
    <br>You are good Jehovah You are good
    <br>WATCH This Wound CLOSE After PRAYER...
    <br>My Lord is so good He is so good
    <br>My Lord is so good He is so excellent
