    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>This is the Living Water Service,
    <br>the day the Lord has made and we shall rejoice and be glad in it.
    <br>The anointed man of God right now is offering prayer on the Altar.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I think it is your turn now.
    <br>I believe your business will not remain the same.
    <br>I mean, your career will not remain the same.
    <br>Right now, begin to give thanks to God and begin to share your testimony.
    <br>And give a phone call for your celebration.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>Immediately I came down - see what is happening.
    <br>It has started.
    <br>Now, prepare your testimony,
    <br>your celebration.
    <br>See the woman.
    <br>Knowing God's greatness and His ability to put us over any circumstances of life,
    <br>people step out with their cups to take the Living Water
    <br>and to offer the desires of their hearts to God Almighty,
    <br>as they climb and lay down on The SCOAN Mountain of Prayer.
    <br>Many vomited out different poisonous substances
    <br>and many who were possessed by the evil spirits were delivered at The SCOAN Mountain of Prayer.
    <br>As the people take turns to collect the Living Water from the tap,
    <br>this man, also by faith, receives his own portion.
    <br>He drinks from his cup and immediately drops some directly on the affected parts of his body,
    <br>where his affliction lies.
    <br>God, the Restorer, the Redeemer of our body and soul
    <br>meets him at the point of his needs, at The SCOAN Mountain of Prayer.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Bamidele Adegoke.
    <br>I am from Ondo State but I reside in Kano State.
    <br>Beside me is my lovely wife.
    <br>We are blessed with two lovely children.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is something that I can never forget.
    <br>I am here to glorify God for the wonderful miracle performed in my life through the Living Water.
    <br>I have been battling kidney stones for over 10 years.
    <br>This has led to a swollen kidney, swollen urethra, I could not breathe properly,
    <br>I could not sit down, I could not sleep.
    <br>Whenever I went to the office, I had to take painkillers.
    <br>At times, I would need to meet the nurse to give me injections.
    <br>Those injections are not ordinary injections - they are powerful painkillers.
    <br>When you take them, you feel them going through your body and hitting the spot,
    <br>where the pain is located.
    <br>This disturbed my life so much that I could not walk properly
    <br>and my job requires me to meet customers on a daily basis.
    <br>That was why I was relying on those painkillers.
    <br>I went to several doctors and one of the doctors told me...
    <br>Because I has a surgery before - I don't know if camera can show it.
    <br>This is where I had the initial surgery 10 years ago and they told me everything was OK.
    <br>But since that surgery the pain never went away; the pain has always been there.
    <br>To God be the glory, I came to The SCOAN to participate in the Living Water Service and God did it.
    <br>Before then, I went to see a doctor, in the place I reside and he told me,
    <br>"This had been going for too long. We need to do something about it."
    <br>I said, "OK. What are we going to do?"
    <br>He said, "We are going to cut your urethra, bladder, then we remove the stone
    <br>and implant the urethra back into the bladder.
    <br>I was like... "You are talking as if you are going to cut a chicken."
    <br>So, we went to see another doctor and he said he would do something else.
    <br>He would use a machine to perform the surgery;
    <br>if the kidney was not OK, he would remove the kidney.
    <br>I said, "Ha!"
    <br>My wife kept on encouraging me that we should visit The SCOAN.
    <br>I came on that fateful day, partook in the Living Water Service
    <br>and went back to my State where I reside.
    <br>The day I was supposed to make the payment for the surgery,
    <br>that very day, I felt the stone moving down.
    <br>I went to ease myself, I went back to pray, went back to ease myself and the stone just came out.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Let me show you something on the board - what I am talking about.
    <br>You can see - there is a test here: Right Hydronephrosis and Hydroureter.
    <br>This means that the kidney and the urethra were swollen up.
    <br>This is another one; we did a CT scan in Kano also - you can see the result.
    <br>The same thing: Right hydronephrosis presumably due to impacted vesical calculus.
    <br>That is the stone blocking the kidney.
    <br>The same thing here again:
    <br>Hydronephrosis right kidney due to impacted ureteric stone.
    <br>And I have been living with this for months and years.
    <br>After partaking in the Living Water Service, as I said,
    <br>I could not believe what happened because I was a man of little faith.
    <br>Now, my faith is as strong as anything else.
    <br>I went to the toilet that very morning.
    <br>As I said, that was the morning I was to make the payment for the surgery.
    <br>The stone just came out.
    <br>I had to put my hand in the water system to bring it out.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Can you show us the stone?
    <br>As you can see, this is the stone.
    <br>You can see the size of the stone.
    <br>I took it to show to the doctor.
    <br>He said, "You must have felt a lot of pain when the stone was coming out."
    <br>To glory of God, I felt no pain.
    <br>The Living Water from The SCOAN did it for me.
    <br>And you can see; the latest results:
    <br>'Conclusion: Normal study'.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for Jesus?
    <br>Put your hands together louder for the miracle working God.
    <br>Can you tell us the changes you have seen in your health?
    <br>When I was battling this issue, I couldn't breathe well.
    <br>Anytime I took breath, I felt pain, because there was pressure on the kidneys.
    <br>After the Living Water Service, I breathe well,
    <br>I can go out to meet customers anytime I want.
    <br>Before, I couldn't endure 30 minutes; I had to go to the toilet to ease myself.
    <br>The urine was coming bit by bit.
    <br>But now, I am free, I am strong, I can do anything.
    <br>- Praise the Lord!
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>And I believe when you had that problem, as many medical conditions require some special diet,
    <br>maybe you had to undergo such?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I was going through this predicament,
    <br>I was not allowed to take anything salty, I could not eat a lot of food,
    <br>I only ate fruits, cereals, some little nuts and vegetables.
    <br>I could not eat my chicken and rice the way I liked it to eat.
    <br>A lot of things I could not eat, but now...
    <br>Give me and try me and you will be surprised.
    <br>So you have been eating those delicious meals ever since God performed this miracle?
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>And have you suffered from any health crisis?
    <br>No health crisis.
    <br>Put your hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>My name is Fadilat Titilayo Abdulaziz.
    <br>My husband has said it all.
    <br>It all started 10 years ago, a few months before our wedding, when he did the first operation.
    <br>Since then, his life has not been the same; pains upon pains.
    <br>I said, "For how long are we going to continue like this?"
    <br>So we went back to the urologist that did the first operation.
    <br>I said, "Sir, you did the operation. How come you say there is another thing
    <br>and you don't know what causes the blockage?"
    <br>He said, "What we are going to do is to cut the urethra and implant it in the bladder."
    <br>I was like, "What kind of thing is that? How can you cut the urethra and implant it in another place?
    <br>God has fixed everything perfectly, so if you cut it, it is not going to be normal."
    <br>So I went back and met my sister and she said they tampered with the kidney
    <br>during the first operation.
    <br>I said, "OK. What are we going to do?
    <br>Please, before you do this operation, let us seek the face of God.
    <br>Don't do this operation yet."
    <br>He said, "My dear, I cannot bear this pain. I am going through a lot of pain."
    <br>I said, "No problem. Let us go to The SCOAN and seek the face of God.
    <br>Anything God says then; if you are to do the operation - no problem."
    <br>Then we came to The SCOAN and he participated in the Living Water Service.
    <br>I was not there; I told him to travel down to this place.
    <br>He called me on the phone and said, "My dear, I have been sitting here for long.
    <br>Nothing is being done."
    <br>I said, "Just exercise patience.
    <br>You cannot even walk for two minutes - now you have been sitting for almost 30 minutes
    <br>and you do not feel any pain."
    <br>He said, "Yes, no problem."
    <br>Later he called me saying that they were going to the Altar to take the Morning Water.
    <br>When he came back, I asked him how he was feeling.
    <br>He said it was better, no more pain.
    <br>I said, "Breathe!" - he made a breath and said it was good.
    <br>After the Living Water Service, I dreamt and saw T.B. Joshua in my dream.
    <br>He brought something out, and this thing in his hand looked very rotted.
    <br>He told me, "This is what is disturbing your husband."
    <br>I looked at the thing that came out of my husband.
    <br>I was glorifying God.
    <br>When I woke up, I started telling God, "God, I thank you. I know You have done it already."
    <br>When I was saying this, my husband came in.
    <br>We have a small prayer room where we normally observe our prayer.
    <br>He came to the room and shown me and put this on my palms and said,
    <br>"My dear, look at what came out of me."
    <br>I couldn't hold back my tears and I started crying, thanking God, saying,
    <br>"God, Your name alone be glorified. Only You can do what no man can do."
    <br>I give God the glory that there is no need for operation anymore, in Jesus' name.
    <br>For how long did you suffer from that problem of kidney stone?
    <br>10 good years.
    <br>What was your condition like during that 10 years?
    <br>As I said, I lived on pain medications daily.
    <br>Swollen kidney, pain, I could not breathe, I had to go to the toilet constantly to ease myself,
    <br>I could not sit down to have any meeting, I could not eat anything I wanted to eat.
    <br>Anytime I moved, it was pain.
    <br>Immediately I drank the Water, the first thing I noticed was: zero pain.
    <br>The pain went away completely.
    <br>No more pain.
    <br>Healed Of Kidney Stones
    <br>Living Water Testimony
    <br>In fact, this is wonderful.
    <br>At times, we humans, we don't have enough faith.
    <br>When something happens to you, you start running up and down.
    <br>But when you have just a little bit of faith, God is there to always answer our prayer.
    <br>It is not only a surprise, it is more than a miracle, words cannot express this thing in my life.
    <br>There is absolutely nothing the Living Water cannot do.
    <br>It can do anything, through the power of the Most High God.
    <br>My little advice would be for those with little faith:
    <br>Watch and grow your faith, for God heals and He is here in The SCOAN.
    <br>We thank you for that wonderful advice.
    <br>You have heard from the brother and we have seen what God has done.
