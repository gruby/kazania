    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua's Visit To The Holy Land - Jerusalem & The Sea Of Galilee
    <br>In Matthew 4, Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the Kingdom
    <br>and healing all kinds of sickness and disease among the people.
    <br>After these things, Jesus went out over the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.
    <br>As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea
    <br>for they were fishermen.
    <br>Then Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men".
    <br>They immediately left their nets and followed him.
    <br>When he had come into Jerusalem in John 21, all the city was moved, saying, "Who is this?"
    <br>So the multitudes said, "This is Jesus, the Prophet from Nazareth of Galilee".
    <br>And this is Prophet T.B. Joshua's visit to Jerusalem and the Sea of Galilee - a visit to the Holy Land.

    <br>In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptised by John in the Jordan.
    <br>And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opened
    <br>and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove, and a voice came from Heaven,
    <br>"Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased". In Mark 1: 9-11.
    <br>From this very valley, a call to visit, which is T.B. Joshua.

    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives At The Sea Of Galilee By Helicopter to Meet The Mayor Of Jordan Valley
    <br>An Israeli Television Station Awaits The Arrival Of Prophet T.B. Joshua To The Sea Of Galilee
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives At The Sea Of Galilee By Helicopter to Meet The Mayor Of Jordan Valley
    <br>Prophet!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Is Welcomed By The Mayor Of The Jordan Valley Regional Council
    <br>Thank you very much for coming to the Sea of Galilee.
    <br>Thank you, Mayor. I am happy to meet you.
    <br>I appreciate that you came all the way from Nigeria.
    <br>I have heard so much about you.
    <br>Thank you very much. Let's go inside.
    <br>Welcoming Prophet T.B. Joshua to the historic and biblical region is Mayor Idan Grinbaum.
    <br>The Mayor of the Jordan Valley ushers the Man of God to Beit Gabriel, to the peace room -
    <br>a historic room where peace was reconfirmed between Jordan and Israel during a 1994 meeting
    <br>with Israeli Prime Minister Jitzchak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein.
    <br>Awaiting him is an Israeli TV Station that takes the opportunity to have an exclusive interview
    <br>with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Pastor Joshua, may I ask, you are known as a Prophet; what is your prophecy for this land?
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>Are we going to have war or peace?
    <br>No, don't worry, that is why we are here.
    <br>We are here.
    <br>Whatever life brings, I will be here with you.
    <br>So, we are protected now?
    <br>By the grace of God.
    <br>Can you tell us in a few sentences, how did you get your power?
    <br>From my Father, Jesus, who was born in this land.
    <br>I am an inheritance of His grace - the grace of Jesus Christ.
    <br>What was your first prophecy?
    <br>It is not my prophecy; it is God's prophecy.
    <br>You cure people by chasing the devil or demons out of them;
    <br>are demons here also in this land?
    <br>Demons are responsible for the pain, killing, stealing and destruction.
    <br>My purpose of praying for people is to give them relief,
    <br>to separate them from the demons that are responsible for the pain and affliction.

    <br>walking where He had walked during His earthly ministry.
