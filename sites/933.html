  <p>    
    <br>During one of the Sunday services at The SCOAN,
    <br>the evangelists are sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua to move in the midst of the congregation
    <br>and minister the Morning Water in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Remember, the Bible says in the book of Acts 19, that anything that had come into contact
    <br>with Apostle Paul was taken to the afflicted and the oppressed
    <br>and they received healing and deliverance.
    <br>As it was, so it is.
    <br>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>And He can use any medium to express Himself and His mission to others.
    <br>As this instrument of God's power descends upon the people,
    <br>the reaction is as instant as it is awesome.
    <br>Darkness flees.
    <br>Unclean spirits are exposed and people are restored to the original position in which God created them.
    <br>Total liberty of spirit, soul and body.
    <br>Among the congregants is this lady who immediately looses control of her faculties
    <br>as the Morning Water is ministered.
    <br>Let's watch the spiritual battle that follows.
    <br>Now speak! Who are you in this body?
    <br>Speak! Who are you in this body, you demon?
    <br>Who are you in this body?
    <br>Leave me alone!
    <br>Speak out! Who are you in this body?
    <br>Leave me alone!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ, you have no choice.
    <br>And you can't resist this - this is the power of God.
    <br>Speak, in the name of Jesus Christ! Who are you in this body?
    <br>I am a queen.
    <br>As a queen, what have you done to her?
    <br>I am the queen of this body.
    <br>I destroyed everything around and inside her.
    <br>Speak in the name of Jesus Christ! What have you destroyed?
    <br>Name what you have destroyed, you demon.
    <br>I destroyed her health.
    <br>You have destroyed her health. Mention the sickness you have given her.
    <br>She has no faith in your God.
    <br>Speak, in the name of Jesus' Christ.
    <br>She has no faith in your God.
    <br>She is unhappy; I destroyed everything in her life.
    <br>I destroyed her marriage and will make her divorce.
    <br>She will be unhappy until the end of her life.
    <br>Now, listen to this!
    <br>You demon, speak! Mention what you have done to her marriage.
    <br>Speak, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>What have you done to her marriage?
    <br>I irritate him all the time.
    <br>Who is this man standing beside you? Who is he? Speak!
    <br>This is her husband.
    <br>Ok, this is her husband.
    <br>Mention what you have done to her marriage.
    <br>I want them to divorce.
    <br>You want them to divorce. Now explain - what are the things you have made her to do?
    <br>What have you caused this woman to do in her marriage? Explain.
    <br>I have many powers; I can make people worship me.
    <br>What else have you done to her family?
    <br>What else have you done to her?
    <br>Apart from her marital life, what else have you done to her?
    <br>I told you she is unhappy. Her mother and sister are unhappy; she will be unhappy all her life.
    <br>He irritates me because he prays all the time.
    <br>Who made her to be depressed?
    <br>And what do you want her to do because of her unhappiness?
    <br>She only thinks about her illnesses.
    <br>What do you want her to do due to her unhappiness and depression?
    <br>What do you want her to do, you demon? Speak!
    <br>I want to separate them so that she can do whatever I want.
    <br>It is painful for me.
    <br>You are welcome, sir. Who is she to you?
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>Can you tell us what you can say about your wife?
    <br>She has mentioned that the demon wants both of you to be separated.
    <br>What can you say about that?
    <br>Yes, the demon always makes her irritate me.
    <br>It tries to make us always unhappy and have a confrontation.
    <br>Tell us about her character, how she behaves at home, and how she causes trouble.
    <br>She can't pray or read anything spiritual. Her spiritual life is zero.
    <br>She can't do anything in terms of praying and believing.
    <br>She mentioned that this demon caused her to be unhappy
    <br>and caused everybody in the house to be sad. What can you say about that?
    <br>The demon tries to make her aggressive and depressed.
    <br>Who caused her depression? Who made her to be depressed?
    <br>Speak, in the name of Jesus' Christ! Who made her to be depressed?
    <br>I caused it. I can cause it to anyone here.
    <br>What else have you done to her?
    <br>She will be alone and she will never have children.
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>When she was born, I was there. I'm from generations.
    <br>By the special grace of God, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has sent this Morning Water
    <br>to deliver you and today is the end.
    <br>Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Your time has expired in this body and today is the last day.
    <br>You have to leave.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Out of this body, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Out of this body!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out of this body!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I hate you!
    <br>You have no choice.
    <br>The power of God is more than you. Jesus owns all authority.
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Out of her!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>I have lived here for centuries. Do you want me to come out?
    <br>No matter how long you have been in this body, you demon, today is your end.
    <br>You have to leave this body and go to the pit of hell.
    <br>Now, Jesus wants you to leave. Out of this body!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name we pray.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for her deliverance.
    <br>In Jesus' name. You are free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up, Madam, you are free in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>through the medium of the Morning Water sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You are free in Jesus' name.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, we are free. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>So who is this man standing beside you?
    <br>He is my husband.
    <br>Now Jesus Christ has set you free through the medium of the Morning Water sent by Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and today Jesus Christ has declared you free. Continue to walk in the light of your testimony.
    <br>Sir, whatever she has said today, please do not remind her of her past.
    <br>Her past is over and you continue to live for Christ Jesus from now henceforth, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
    <br>Kazakhstan
    <br>Good morning, Church. Her name is Elmira, we came from Kazakhstan and I am her husband.
    <br>Tell us your testimony.
    <br>Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>When we got married, we noticed that she had the spirit of anger
    <br>and we understood that we needed to do something about it.
    <br>So we went to different churches to get this deliverance but there was no help.
    <br>We have heard it from the woman that the problem that brought her to The SCOAN
    <br>was that she was possessed with a demon that caused her a terrible spirit of anger.
    <br>She has been to several places and churches for deliverance all to no avail.
    <br>They both deemed it necessary to visit The SCOAN for her deliverance.
    <br>Tell us how this spirit of anger affected your life, your marriage and everything that has to do with you,
    <br>before you came for deliverance.
    <br>Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that we had a normal family, no problems with money, shelter, job,
    <br>but she felt very disturbed, caring a lot about different things.
    <br>She would become angry because of small things that were happening not the way she wanted them to.
    <br>She wanted everything to be her way.
    <br>We have heard it from the husband.
    <br>He explained that the spirit of anger affected the marriage in the sense that
    <br>she got angry at every little thing and she always wanted her own will to supersede his,
    <br>until they finally came to The SCOAN for deliverance.
    <br>Tell us how you come to know about The SCOAN.
    <br>Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that after we recognised the problem, we started to search for help
    <br>and we saw a video on YouTube where there was deliverance in The SCOAN
    <br>and I as her husband started to pray and to prepare, since the beginning of the year to come here.
    <br>Because of the terrible problem of this spirit of anger, they started looking for a solution.
    <br>That was how they went on the internet and as God would have it,
    <br>they came across Emmanuel TV.
    <br>That's how both of them came together and decided to visit The SCOAN for her deliverance.
    <br>Tell us what happened last Sunday when the evangelist ministered the Morning Water on you.
    <br>Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>When the Morning Water ministration started, she looked around and saw many people
    <br>who were to minister the Morning Water and she began to worry.
    <br>After the evangelist started ministering the Morning Water on her,
    <br>she doesn't remember from that moment what was happening. She couldn't understand it.
    <br>She could understand everything in her mind but she could not control her speech and actions.
    <br>You have heard the husband interpret what she rightly said.
    <br>While the evangelist was ministering the Morning Water,
    <br>before the evangelist got to where she was, she started feeling worried and uncomfortable.
    <br>The moment the evangelist ministered  the Morning Water on her, she lost consciousness of herself.
    <br>At the end of the day, she found herself being delivered.
    <br>Tell us, ever since you have been delivered,
    <br>what are the changes you have seen in your life, to really confirm
    <br>that the spirit of anger has left you completely.
    <br>Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that since the deliverance, she feels calm and peaceful. She has peace inside her.
    <br>She trusts God, she trusts me as her husband and she has no urge to be in control.
    <br>Before, she had a problem with belief because the spirit always tried to make her focus on her problems.
    <br>She could not read and grow in her faith.
    <br>But now, she feels stronger spiritually.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>You have heard the husband.
    <br>She said that ever since the deliverance took place,
    <br>she has seen tremendous changes in her life and also in her marriage.
    <br>She is no longer authoritative in her marriage, she no longer wants her will to supersede that of her husband,
    <br>she is very calm now and does not see herself getting angry at every little thing.
    <br>She said the area that baffled her most was that before her deliverance,
    <br>each time she wanted to read the Word of God, she would find herself thinking about her past.
    <br>For that reason, she would lose concentration.
    <br>But after the deliverance, she developed love for the Word of God,
    <br>she can read and fully concentrate.
    <br>She is giving thanks to God Almighty for restoring her concentration to the will of God.
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle working God!
    <br>Finally, what word of advice do you have for those who are listening to you around the world?
    <br>Mrs Elmira Pak & Husband
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>She said that if you feel disappointed or have some doubts about God's power,
    <br>just belief in God, stay faithful to Him.
    <br>Wherever you are does not matter. Just belief in God and you will see His glory.
    <br>To God be the glory. You have heard it all.
    <br>That if you feel disappointed and belief that the power of God does not exist,
    <br>all you need to do is to belief and trust in Him
    <br>because God is powerful and faithful to those who are faithful to Him as well.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for that!
    <br>Sir, could you introduce yourself to us? Who are you to her?
    <br>My name is Igor Pak. I am her husband.
    <br>What do you have to say about her testimony?
    <br>Actually it is true because sometimes I would notice that her faith was weak.
    <br>She could not read the Word, she could not pray,
    <br>she was always disturbed about some other things beside God.
    <br>Now I see that her character has changed.
    <br>You mean after her deliverance?
    <br>After the deliverance, I can see that she has changed, she has peace,
    <br>and she is not disturbed all the time.
    <br>You have heard the husband testifying to the goodness of the Lord in the life of his wife after her deliverance.
    <br>Prior to her deliverance, he could see that the wife had lost total concentration concerning the things of God,
    <br>she didn't read her Bible and she didn't talk about God
    <br>because of that terrible spirit of anger that almost destroyed her life.
    <br>But he is giving glory to God Almighty that after the wife has been delivered,
    <br>he has witnessed numerous changes in her life.
    <br>Right now, she can read the Word of God with full concentration.
    <br>She has peace in her heart and the family is united once again.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ for that!
    <br>As the husband, what word of advice do you have?
    <br>My advice to husbands is that you should not panic.
    <br>Trust in God. He is faithful.
    <br>Prayers are always heard by God and He is prepare the answer for you. Glory be to God.
    <br>Amen! In other words, prayers for many years are not lost,
    <br>they are issuing themselves out in glory, slowly but surely.
    <br>Don't lose your faith in God, put your faith in God and trust in Him alone.
    <br>For He alone can surprise you in every situation.
    <br>To God be the glory. We thank God Almighty for your lives
    <br>and we also rejoice with you for this wonderful transformation.
    <br>We want to advise you by saying that you should make the Word of God the standard for your lives
    <br>so that your deliverance will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
