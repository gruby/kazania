  <p>    
    <br>My name is Ms Rebecca.
    <br>I'm from Ghana.
    <br>I have needles in my body and have been operated on several times.
    <br>I am still not okay.
    <br>The doctors have removed 18 needles but I am still not okay.
    <br>That is the reason why I'm here.
    <br>I know through Christ I am going to be healed.
    <br>Where are those needles in your body?
    <br>These are the scars.
    <br>They operated on you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let's see.
    <br>These are the places where they removed the needles?
    <br>Yes, these are the places where the needles were removed from.
    <br>But each place where they removed the needles - what happened to the place?
    <br>In the same place, they would still find needles, up to five.
    <br>Inside the same spot?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Immediately they stitched it?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So how many needles have they removed?
    <br>About eighteen.
    <br>Can we see the needles that they removed.
    <br>These are some of the needles.
    <br>And they have removed how many of these?
    <br>Eighteen.
    <br>Eighteen?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you tell us how many needles are in your body now.
    <br>I can't tell how many are left.
    <br>Let's see the X-ray.
    <br>This is the X-ray.
    <br>You can see those lines - they are the needles.
    <br>This is where they removed the needles from.
    <br>Why did they stop removing them?
    <br>The spot where they removed needles, five would enter.
    <br>Is that the reason why they stopped?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They stopped removing the needles because at each spot where they removed needles,
    <br>by the time they stitched it, five would enter.
    <br>Whenever they removed a needle from a particular place,
    <br>the following week, when I went for an X-ray, they would find 5 more needles.
    <br>In the same spot?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can we see the medical report, the statement given to you from the doctor.
    <br>This is the medical report.
    <br>It is from a specialist from the Ghanuba Clinic, Accra.
    <br>The doctor asked me to bring it here because it was beyond his understanding.
    <br>So, the medical report here is from Ghanuba Clinic.
    <br>It is written, "To whom it may concern.
    <br>Dear sir or madam; a medical report concerning Rebecca Idi.
    <br>The above patient has been under my care since last year.
    <br>She reported with chronic abdominal pain.
    <br>Diagnosis of umbilical hernia was made for which she was operated.
    <br>About about one month, she reported with abdominal pain
    <br>and this time a swelling was noted above the umbilicus, in the midline.
    <br>This was interpreted as epigastric hernia and was again operated
    <br>and this time a needle was retrieved from the site.
    <br>She reported again with the same pain.
    <br>An X-ray conducted revealed multiple needles on the X-ray film.
    <br>So far I have surgically removed about twelve of the needles from the abdominal wall.
    <br>A follow-up X-ray still reveals the presence of such needles.
    <br>This is beyond my understanding.
    <br>Any help offered her is therefore highly appreciated.
    <br>Dr Twumasi, a Senior Surgeon at Ghanuba Clinic in Ghana.
    <br>There are now 1000 needles in the body.
    <br>How many have they removed?
    <br>They removed eighteen.
    <br>You have seen the spots where they removed them.
    <br>At each spot, one was removed and almost five entered back.
    <br>What do you want to say about this?
    <br>What I want to educate you about this is that
    <br>when you remove it physically, you double the problem.
    <br>Because it was commanded in by incantation - evil spirit,
    <br>it must also be commanded out by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It is not something you are supposed to see with your naked eyes.
    <br>The people that are doing this do not carry the needles and throw them
    <br>or put it in the food or drink.
    <br>They command it, and it enters invisibly.
    <br>We are not fighting the flesh and blood.
    <br>The command is not by throwing it or giving food or poison.
    <br>If a situation has become a curse - this is a curse - who can remove the curse?
    <br>This is why He was crucified.
    <br>He died on the cross.
    <br>They command it in by the power of evil spirit
    <br>and we command that thing out in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>The thing was not commanded three times.
    <br>It was commanded once by the power of evil spirit and thousands entered.
    <br>It is not one at a time that they command.
    <br>Evil spirit, take it.
    <br>No.
    <br>The whole thing; thousands were commanded and thousands entered.
    <br>A just mere opening of our lips, calling the name of Jesus,
    <br>the whole thousand too will disappear.
    <br>Little girl, had you ever experienced this in the family?
    <br>Maybe needles are a generational curse in your family.
    <br>People have needles in their body when they are born.
    <br>Or does any person have needles in his body?
    <br>I am the only person having this problem in the family.
    <br>You see the way she talks.
    <br>Some of those needles are close to her heart.
    <br>It is just everywhere in her body.
    <br>You said you are the only person in the family?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How did this thing enter your body?
    <br>I don't know how they got into my body.
    <br>The doctor gave me a magnet to be rubbing on my tummy
    <br>so that they could come up to the skin surface for them to cut.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>Each time the doctor wants to remove them,
    <br>he will give you a magnet?
    <br>Yes, I have the magnet in the house.
    <br>The magnet that magnetised the needles?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You then used a magnet to rub your body?
    <br>Then, it would come up to the skin.
    <br>I would go to the hospital for them to cut and remove the needles.
    <br>My God.
    <br>She will meet me at the prayer line.
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>Because of this situation, I couldn't complete my education
    <br>and I am always at home, suffering all the time.
    <br>As you are standing now, can you point to where you suspect the needles?
    <br>From this side to my pelvis.
    <br>It is all right.
    <br>She said she can locate some here.
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>I don't want to go for surgery anymore.
    <br>If God sent me to this lady today, I will be the most delighted person here.
    <br>To see how this girl will be free.
    <br>Those needles in the body - just like that eventually.
    <br>The person who did that will be brought to book.
    <br>What other efforts did you make in trying to remove the needles in your body?
    <br>Through traditional healers.
    <br>Are you a Christian?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Give it to the sister.
    <br>My name is Ms Julia Kujah.
    <br>I brought her from Ghana.
    <br>Her father works for me.
    <br>She has been in and out of hospitals and had several surgeries done.
    <br>The more surgeries they did, the more needles they found.
    <br>Her father recently came to me and said someone introduced him to a traditional healer
    <br>and that he wanted to take her there.
    <br>I told him not to but he was desperate.
    <br>I couldn't stop him because that was his child.
    <br>Then, he went.
    <br>He told me that the traditional healer used an egg to rub her body.
    <br>The needles entered the egg; they broke it and took the needles out.
    <br>I told him that he was going to compound this girl's problems,
    <br>that it was spiritual, created by satan and only Jesus could save her.
    <br>He came back to me a few days later and said he had thought about what I had said.
    <br>I told him, "Persuade the doctor so he will be willing to give you a medical report.
    <br>Then, we will go to the arena of liberty; I know Jesus can heal her".
    <br>That is how far we have come.
    <br>Can you see the huge challenges we have now.
    <br>We have made the name Jesus unpopular.
    <br>Nobody believes again.
    <br>Before people can come to Jesus, it means there is nowhere else to go.
    <br>They might have gone far and spent a fortune.
    <br>I asked if she is a Christian.
    <br>She said she is a Christian.
    <br>But she never thought of going to a man of God.
    <br>Did you pray over this thing?
    <br>Yes, we have.
    <br>We have been to so many churches.
    <br>Yes, they have been to many churches for prayer and deliverance but to no avail.
    <br>There is no other way for medical doctors but to recommend surgery
    <br>and they would have to operate on the whole body.
    <br>As you operate and stitch, five will go back at the same spot.
    <br>It is a sign to tell us that there are powers that cause people to bow down.
    <br>My sister, don't worry.
    <br>God asked you to come here and I know the same God will deliver you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Let us wait for God's time.
    <br>At God's time which I know will be now.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>21-year-old Ms Rebecca Idi has come all the way from Ghana to The SCOAN
    <br>with an unusual problem of needles in her body.
    <br>She had been operated on several times where a total of 18 needles were removed.
    <br>This is the X-ray that shows the numerous needles that are still inside her body, despite the surgeries.
    <br>This is a medical report from a hospital in Ghana that attested to their inability
    <br>to provide a permanent solution, despite many treatments and surgeries.
    <br>Here are some of the needles that were removed by the doctors through surgery.
    <br>After these needles were removed through operation, the doctors did a follow-up X-ray
    <br>and to their surprise, it showed the presence of even more needles in her body.
    <br>The doctors were completely mystified by the case and made a decision to no longer take any action.
    <br>This problem has indeed gone beyond the power of nature, beyond medical science and technology.
    <br>It has become a curse.
    <br>Who can remove the curse?
    <br>Only Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, has been used by Jesus Christ
    <br>to break every curse in the lives of the people.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, every mountain, curse and chain is being removed
    <br>and they are restored back to the original position God Almighty created them.
    <br>Among those being prayed for at the prayer line is Ms Rebecca Idi,
    <br>with the problem of needles in her body.
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>My name is Ms Rebecca.
    <br>I am from Ghana.
    <br>I have needles in my body and they keep on pricking me all the time.
    <br>Please help me, Man of God.
    <br>I have needles in my body and they keep on pricking me all the time.
    <br>Please help me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>I have needles in my body and they keep on pricking me.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord, I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Lord, I am free!
    <br>It is not something you would not know.
    <br>She herself should know whether she is free.
    <br>It is not just issue of, "By faith, I am free".
    <br>Because the pain is there; she feels the pain, the needles, everything.
    <br>Take her somewhere and let her check herself.
    <br>Give her two to five minutes to check and then come back.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Prayer Line
    <br>The thing came by evil spirit and we have to command it out by Holy Spirit.
    <br>This is a test to our faith.
    <br>If there is anything called miracle, this is a miracle.
    <br>This is what we call signs and wonders.
    <br>It is not an issue of headache going but you can see the needles brought out
    <br>and you can see thousand needles inside.
    <br>Signs and wonders.
    <br>The same way Moses said to the Red Sea.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for saving my life!
    <br>We are talking of the command Elijah used when the little children were calling him "bald head man"
    <br>and he commanded the bear to come out and eat them.
    <br>They could not even find the bones and blood on the floor.
    <br>We call it a command.
    <br>It is not an issue of, "In the name of Jesus, go. In the name of Jesus, I rebuke, I bind".
    <br>If that is what Daniel used in the lion den, the lion would have removed one hand
    <br>before Jesus comes to the rescue.
    <br>The way you offer prayer today, "In Jesus' name, I rebuke.
    <br>In Jesus' name, I bind".
    <br>The lion will not hear that; the lion will not wait for that.
    <br>Half of the body would have been gone before Jesus came to the rescue.
    <br>Three men, Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego, at the furnace.
    <br>A fire that nothing can be compared with.
    <br>They were dropped inside.
    <br>Even before they landed, if they had prayed like, "In the name of Jesus, I rebuke, I stop the fire",
    <br>I think the fire would have consumed them before that time.
    <br>Try to understand the command.
    <br>There is command and there is a command.
    <br>Ms Rebecca Idi, set free by a command in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>goes to a nearby restroom to check her body.
    <br>God, thank You so much for healing me.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me!
    <br>Praise the living God!
    <br>I cannot feel the needle pricks anymore.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for sаving my life.
    <br>I don't feel the needle pricks anymore.
    <br>They have disappeared!
    <br>I thank God so much.
    <br>Ms Rebecca Idi testifies that she can no longer feel the sharp pain
    <br>caused by the needles in her body.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, I am free!
    <br>I don't feel the needle pricks anymore.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Have you checked yourself?
    <br>Are you free?
    <br>Before when I would touch my tummy, I would feel the needle pricks.
    <br>I don't feel them anymore.
    <br>Let me tell you something that happened at the healing section.
    <br>I never knew when that would happen.
    <br>I was thinking that it would be today.
    <br>When I stood here and she was talking, I saw it and I was looking at it
    <br>but I never heard anything.
    <br>How would this thing be done?
    <br>I knew that with God all things are possible and I was looking at it.
    <br>But I never knew that the whole thing would happen that day.
    <br>So, when I was moving round at the prayer line, I didn't see any green light -
    <br>an indication that I should pray for her.
    <br>I was praying for everyone; I was just moving.
    <br>Before I got to her, Prophet T.B. Joshua had got there already.
    <br>This is the lady here.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Stand close to your seat there!
    <br>When I was with this man, the resurrection power had already got to the lady.
    <br>The footprint of God.
    <br>Do you know what I mean with the footprint of God?
    <br>It moves with our shadow.
    <br>When we move, it is mostly on our shadow.
    <br>Look at you - I am on you.
    <br>Can you see the shadow?
    <br>See the shadow.
    <br>Can you see the shadow?
    <br>That is shadow.
    <br>That is the shadow.
    <br>The shadow overwhelmed him.
    <br>That shadow that overwhelmed him is full of lightning.
    <br>It is not thunder.
    <br>It is more than thunder.
    <br>Thunder is an agent of God.
    <br>But when I say "lightning", I mean the resurrection power that can go beyond the wall.
    <br>When it lights through the wall, it comes out at the other side.
    <br>But thunder - no.
    <br>Can you see that it has still captured him.
    <br>He could not move.
    <br>The resurrection power.
    <br>The same resurrection power can put him on the floor.
    <br>Look at him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That's it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is it.
    <br>That is the resurrection power - how powerful!
    <br>It can move.
    <br>How powerful.
    <br>And not only him; He can bring all of them together and make them fall.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When I was moving and the sister was there, before getting to the sister,
    <br>the Lord was telling me, "Don't be afraid. Go there", because I had already seen a sign.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When I realised the presence of God was there before me,
    <br>I just had to grab the shoulder.
    <br>When I grabbed the shoulder, all the needles were right in my hand.
    <br>Right in my hand and it was needles I threw, not the lady.
    <br>The needles had made her become heavy.
    <br>When I pulled out the needles and they were in my hand, I just threw them away.
    <br>Because she was very light, she fell.
    <br>It was not her that was supposed to fall.
    <br>Let's see the sister.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see the lady?
    <br>Can you put the former face to this face - needle face to God's face.
    <br>Let's hear from her.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ms Rebecca; I'm from Ghana.
    <br>Beside me are my dad, my mum, my elder brothers, my kid-sister and my kid-brother
    <br>and my auntie who helped me to come here.
    <br>In fact, you can look at me and compare me to my former appearance.
    <br>I was here last week Sunday.
    <br>I had needles in my body.
    <br>I had gone to so many places - so many doctors, herbal healers - but to no avail.
    <br>I was always in pain.
    <br>I was not schooling or doing anything.
    <br>I couldn't eat, walk or sleep.
    <br>A lady introduced me to The SCOAN.
    <br>She brought me here, last week.
    <br>I was placed on the prayer line, where the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>After he prayed for me, I examined myself very well.
    <br>I could not feel any pricks in my tummy.
    <br>I could eat, do everything, walk well, and sleep like a baby - no more pain.
    <br>I am so grateful to God for saving my life.
    <br>Rebecca
    <br>(Prayer Line Testimony)
    <br>After the prayer, I kept on asking myself each day,
    <br>"Where are the pins God removed from me?
    <br>They are nowhere to be found".
    <br>I thank God for saving me.
    <br>Now, I don't feel any pain anymore, anywhere.
    <br>I can do anything.
    <br>So, I thank God for what He has done for me, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Rebecca
    <br>(Prayer Line Testimony)
    <br>Little girl, now you keep wondering where the pins are?
    <br>Yes, I always wonder how.
    <br>I don't know where they are.
    <br>I am so excited.
    <br>After the prayer, you went to press those places where you felt the pain.
    <br>You knew the pain was there.
    <br>You could not feel those needles there again?
    <br>Not at all.
    <br>After the prayer, I examined myself.
    <br>I pressed my tummy.
    <br>I didn't feel the pricking that I used to feel whenever I pressed my tummy.
    <br>Your urine is clear now? There is nothing like blood?
    <br>Yes, everything is okay.
    <br>I am okay; I am alright - nothing.
    <br>Rebecca
    <br>(Prayer Line Testimony)
    <br>And you sleep very well now - no nightmares?
    <br>I now sleep like a newborn baby; I am okay!
    <br>I don't have sleepless nights anymore.
    <br>In the past, before you were prayed for, what were you experiencing every night?
    <br>In my dreams, I would see someone giving me food to eat.
    <br>But now, I don't have those kind of dreams anymore -
    <br>someone chasing me to kill me - I don't have them anymore.
    <br>Do you know the power you are under?
    <br>Sing this song along with me - Majesty.
    <br>Majesty
    <br>Worship His majesty
    <br>Unto Jesus
    <br>Be all glory, honour and praise
    <br>Majesty
    <br>Kingdom authority
    <br>Flows from His throne unto His own
    <br>His anthem raise
    <br>So exalt
    <br>Lift up on high
    <br>The name of Jesus
    <br>Magnify
    <br>Come glorify
    <br>Christ Jesus the King
    <br>Majesty
    <br>Worship His majesty
    <br>Jesus who died
    <br>Now glorified
    <br>King of all kings
    <br>Jesus who died
    <br>Now glorified
    <br>King of all kings
    <br>You may be seated; thank you.
    <br>Take your Bible and read the Book of John 3.
    <br>Start reading from verse 32.
    <br>The Book of John 3:32, "He testifies to what he has seen and heard".
    <br>He testifies to what he has seen and heard.
    <br>John 3:32, "but no one accepts his testimony".
    <br>No one accepts his testimony.
    <br>John 3:33, "The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful".
    <br>That is all.
    <br>The one who accepts this testimony among you will say God is truthful.
    <br>John 3:34, "For the one whom God has sent, speaks the Word of God".
    <br>The one that God has sent, speaks the Word of truth - the Word of God;
    <br>the Word of Spirit - the Word of God.
    <br>John 3:34, "for God gives me the Spirit without limit".
    <br>Have you listened to that?
    <br>The Father gave the Spirit to us to make us like His Son.
    <br>John 3:35, "The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in His hands.
    <br>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life".
    <br>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.
    <br>John 3:36, "but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him".
    <br>John 4:1, "The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptising
    <br>more disciples than John -
    <br>although in fact it was not Jesus who baptised, but his disciples".
    <br>John 4:3, "When the Lord learnt of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee".
    <br>John 4:4, "Now he had to go through Samaria.
    <br>John 4:5, "So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar,
    <br>near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph".
    <br>John 4:6, "Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey,
    <br>sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour".
    <br>John 4:7, "When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her,
    <br>'Will you give me a drink?'"
    <br>John 4:8, "(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)"
    <br>John 4:9, "The Samaritan woman said to him, 'You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman.
    <br>How can you ask me for a drink?' (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)"
    <br>John 4:10, "Jesus answered her, 'If you knew the gift of God
    <br>and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him
    <br>and he would have given you living water'."
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's hear from the sister.
    <br>In fact, I was a 'ghost' talking to you last week Sunday.
    <br>But I can tell you that I am a human being now.
    <br>All glory to God.
    <br>I thank Him so much for giving me a second chance to live.

    <br>What is your message to the youth?
    <br>All I can tell the youth is that they should put their hope in God
    <br>because He is the only one who can save them.
    <br>So, they should trust and believe in God.
    <br>You said you have been to many places and we know that you have spent a fortune.
    <br>Isn't it?
    <br>A lot of money but I now know God.
    <br>I know that God is here.
    <br>How much have you spent for God to give you so much to restore your life?
    <br>Nothing - not a dime.
    <br>Rebecca
    <br>(Prayer Line Testimony)
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let me thank the sister that brought this sister here.
    <br>She spent her money, preached the Gospel, told her that God is the Healer.
    <br>I think that God is the rewarder.
    <br>Let us just hear a word - what inspired you.
    <br>My name is Ms Julia Kujah.
    <br>I am the one who brought Rebecca here last week.
    <br>My joy knows no bounds.
    <br>It was not easy taking on such a challenge
    <br>when everyone else was giving up.
    <br>But I needed to amass faith because from the onset, we didn't have it easy.
    <br>Trying to get her a passport, aside from the usual ups and downs,
    <br>the day they asked her to come and collect her passport,
    <br>every passport that was printed came out but her own one came out blank.
    <br>So I said, "Wow, God, what a challenge!"
    <br>But I didn't give up.
    <br>Then, the day we were supposed to come, I called her and talked to her.
    <br>Then, that evening, I ended up in hospital.
    <br>I was admitted; the following day, my son was admitted; we cancelled it.
    <br>So, it wasn't an easy thing.
    <br>But I thank God that the more the challenges, the more resolved I was.
    <br>I brought her here with all the faith I had.
    <br>God did not disappoint me.
    <br>Indeed, God has done it for her; she is free.
    <br>I have talked to her and seen that her confidence has increased.
    <br>She is smiling, she can walk straight, she is sleeping.
    <br>I've talked to her and asked her if she feels any pain.
    <br>She replied, "No pain at all".
    <br>She is healed and hearty.
    <br>What else can I say but 'Thank You, Jesus'?
    <br>Indeed, our faith in Jesus is never in vain.
    <br>Those who put their trust in God will never be put to shame.
    <br>Rebecca is a testimony, and I want the whole world to know
    <br>that they should put their trust in God.
    <br>God will never fail you.
    <br>If men fail you, turn their backs and give up,
    <br>know that God is alive and He will do it.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I want to give you faith bracelets -
    <br>that is just my promise to give to the sister and you.
    <br>When you go back to your country, you will go with a shining light.

    <br>Thank you; thank you very much.
    <br>My name is Dr Carol Asante.
    <br>I work with the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital.
    <br>I am a specialist with the Department of Anaesthesia.
    <br>After she came from the Prayer Line, I examined her abdomen
    <br>and I found multiple scars on her abdomen which were medical scars.
    <br>She didn't have any pain when I palpated her abdomen.
    <br>She reported that she had had pain prior to that.
    <br>It is the first time that I am giving people publicly.
