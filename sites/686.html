  <p>    
    <br>My name is Mr Odianaka Achumie.
    <br>I come from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>This is my son Somtochukwu Achumie, my wife and my in-laws.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of the Lord in my life and that of my family.
    <br>First and foremost, I want to glorify the name of the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for taking away shame and disgrace and the spirit of death from my family.
    <br>I can't wait to glorify your god too.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I can't wait to glorify your god but for now, it would be very hard for me to say, "I glorify your god".
    <br>As you embrace the Living God...
    <br>You are about to testify not about something God has done.
    <br>I want you to look inwards.
    <br>No matter how much you master the Scripture; without acting on it, without true obedience
    <br>to what you have read, you will remain spiritual babies.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No matter how much you master the Scripture; without acting on the Word,
    <br>without true obedience to what you read, you will remain a spiritual baby".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to let the world know that Prophet T.B. Joshua has a living God.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>[Hallelujah]
    <br>My testimony goes like this: Last month, February, my son called me from his school.
    <br>He is a boarding student.
    <br>He said that he was not feeling well.
    <br>I thought that it was just a minor case.
    <br>I then instructed him to contact the school authority so that they could give him medication, which he did.
    <br>After three days, he called me again.
    <br>I asked him what the problem was.
    <br>He told me that the sickness was still there.
    <br>I told him to prepare to come back home.
    <br>On coming back home, before my very eyes, he came into my room and lay on my bed.
    <br>I witnessed what he passed through.
    <br>Heavy fever, cold, many types of sickness at the same time, complaining about severe headaches,
    <br>that his eyes were closing, chest and stomach pains and hotness of the leg and body.
    <br>I asked what kind of sickness it was and went to the pharmacy to get drugs for him.
    <br>After giving him drugs, he said he would try and cope by himself.
    <br>I said, "OK".
    <br>About three days later, I asked him to go back to school and I gave him some medication to help him cope.
    <br>Back at school, two days later, he called me that the problem was still there.
    <br>I told him to start making his way back home.
    <br>That was on the 5th of March, on Saturday.
    <br>On that day, I was preparing to go somewhere.
    <br>I decided to suspend wherever I was going to come to The SCOAN
    <br>to tell my God what was happening in my son's life.
    <br>I decided to come to The SCOAN with my wife on the 5th.
    <br>Mainly, the purpose why I came was to fellowship with the Church, get the Morning Water and go back home.
    <br>Surprisingly, I saw my son that morning.
    <br>I told him to stay back home, while my wife and I go to Lagos and come back.
    <br>He agreed.
    <br>We came to The SCOAN.
    <br>After two days, we left for our destination – back to Anambra State.
    <br>I introduced the Morning Water to him and told him I knew that with the mercy of God
    <br>in Prophet T.B. Joshua, it would see him through, that he should prepare to go back to school.
    <br>I gave him a bottle of the Morning Water to go back to school with.
    <br>He said, "OK".
    <br>A few days later, he called me that he was coming back home, that the sickness was still there.
    <br>I asked him whether he had used the Morning Water.
    <br>He replied, "Yes".
    <br>I asked him how he had applied it.
    <br>He said when he ministered it to his body, it felt like it didn't touch him, so he opened the bottle and poured
    <br>all of it into his mouth.
    <br>After he poured the bottle of the Morning Water into his mouth, that was where the battle started.
    <br>He said immediately he poured all of the Morning Water inside his mouth,
    <br>it was like there was war inside his body – a heavy burning sensation.
    <br>Then, he decided to run back home because he felt like he was dying.
    <br>Before he had come home, I had already left for work.
    <br>He narrated everything to my wife.
    <br>Then, my wife called me, that my son was back home.
    <br>When I asked him what the matter was, he said, “Daddy, I am dying!”
    <br>I told my wife that I had the Morning Water in my cupboard, that she should take it and minister to him.
    <br>She said that the one he had ministered was burning him, seriously.
    <br>I said that I was sensing there was a battle, that she should do what I told her. She said, “OK”.
    <br>After everything, she said that he had demanded for tea but she was afraid to give him.
    <br>He asked her if it was the last food he would eat in the house before dying.
    <br>I told her that there was a battle going on, that she should use the Morning Water
    <br>and pour it inside the tea, minister it to him, pray and give him the tea to drink.
    <br>She complied with my instructions.
    <br>Immediately he drank that tea, he said, “Mummy, there is a problem.
    <br>Something from my stomach is now coming up to my chest. There is a problem”.
    <br>The mother asked what it was.
    <br>He said that he felt like vomiting.
    <br>Then, my wife said, “Vomit it out!”
    <br>She collected the Morning Water and ministered it to him again.
    <br>Immediately, he vomited.
    <br>Behold, what we saw were seven pins, right in my own bedroom.
    <br>He fainted.
    <br>Look at the pins.
    <br>Using mere Morning Water...
    <br>The question is - "How did these enter?"
    <br>By command.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This means that there is a sort of command in the Morning Water, depending on your faith.
    <br>If your faith is big, your command will be even bigger.
    <br>If your faith is little, the command will also be little.
    <br>What is here?
    <br>Command; we call it command, which is authority.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look at the pins.
    <br>Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Then, my wife ministered the Morning Water on him again, calling the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>“Please, help my son!”
    <br>He was breathing as if he was dying.
    <br>After some time, he calmed down and that was the end of the matter - to date, no more hotness of the body.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Come.
    <br>Boy, what is your name?
    <br>Somtochukwu
    <br>You know that you can lie to your dad and your mum, don't you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you lie to me?
    <br>No.
    <br>You know you are in a cult?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Go and tell your mum and your dad.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Open up and be free finally.
    <br>He has to leave the school immediately and they have to look for another school.
    <br>Did you listen? He is not going back to that school, we have to look for another school.
    <br>I will join you people to look for the best school.
    <br>The school is good but because of...
    <br>We need to remove him from there.
    <br>OK. Tell us how you joined the secret cult.
    <br>My name is Somtochukwu Achumie Emmanuel.
    <br>How I joined the secret cult:
    <br>In JSS3, I met a boy who asked me to come and meet him in the hostel.
    <br>Later that night, I met the boy.
    <br>He said that I should escort him somewhere.
    <br>So, I escorted him somewhere in the bush.
    <br>I saw many boys there who started flogging me with knives and told me to lie down.
    <br>After flogging me, they initiated me using a razor and an egg in the bush.
    <br>After initiating me, from that day, I joined the secret cult.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Each pin represents their mission.
    <br>They were not given to him to be swallowed, but they entered him by command.
    <br>You, as a Christian, use the command by the power of God; they also use commands.
    <br>The Bible says, "We are not fighting the flesh and blood, but spirit beings".
    <br>Powers of principalities.
    <br>These pins entered by command.
    <br>They were not vomited like they said: The pins came out by command.
    <br>That Morning Water - don't play with it.
    <br>Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Those pins became physical pins at the time they were coming out.
    <br>Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony
    <br>So, they flogged you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What is the name of your cult?
    <br>Arobaga.
    <br>OK. It's all right. Forget about that.
    <br>Did you listen to that? This is the name.
    <br>Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony
    <br>In which class are you?
    <br>SS1, sir.
    <br>SS1.
    <br>Can you see your children at home?
    <br>SS1 - the first section of the secondary school.
    <br>If this could happen in SS1, the beginners - so definitely your school, your students, your children...
    <br>We need prayer...
    <br>Our future.
    <br>Did you know when those pins entered you?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>But you were given something like blood?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Let me just assure the father and mother; there is no problem.
    <br>Please, I want to assure you; no problem. OK?
    <br>There is nothing to be afraid of.
    <br>What we need to do now...
    <br>Look; listen, mamma.
    <br>Do you know what we need to do now?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Immediately after the service - wait for me.
    <br>He will not go back to that school.
    <br>We will look for another school.
    <br>We will ask God for direction.
    <br>Right now - he is free.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>God bless you, sir.
    <br>Assume that this revelation about him being in a cult did not come, and he is just being delivered,
    <br>he would still belong to the association and only the poison given to him would be removed.
    <br>But we have removed him from the association because of the revelation.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Mr Odinaka Achumie & Family - Morning Water Testimony
    <br>It's all right.
    <br>Did you suspect anything like that?
    <br>I didn't suspect it, man of God.
    <br>No. Let your husband speak.
    <br>Did you suspect it before?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>I have been telling him not to join anything like a secret cult.
    <br>He assured me that he would never do that.
    <br>Why did you tell the little boy not to join the cult?
    <br>Because at his age...
    <br>You might have seen something.
    <br>Listen.
    <br>If you are telling your son, who is in the secondary school, not to join a secret cult,
    <br>you might have seen some traces in his character, or attitude.
    <br>It is too early to tell a secondary school boy not to join a secret cult.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Please, open up.
    <br>Don't worry. Just tell us everything.
    <br>It is too early.
    <br>If he were at the university...
    <br>Even at the university, if you know what kind of person your son or daughter is,
    <br>you would not even mention that to them.
    <br>Telling your little son at secondary school not to join a secret cult - it is too early.
    <br>And that language is to be for...
    <br>Were you suspecting because of the character, an attitude or what you have seen to say that kind of thing?
    <br>Sir, in the environment where I was living before, almost all youths at his age are occultists.
    <br>That was why I instructed him not to join those boys.
    <br>That also motivated me to move to a different area - very far from there.
    <br>OK.
    <br>We are clear now.
    <br>It was because of the things you saw in the environment you were living in.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Apart from that, have you ever suspected this boy because of his attitude or character?
    <br>Have you seen anything strange?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>I was even shocked when he confirmed.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Do you know the reason why I asked you to stand up?
    <br>Trust yourself and God.
    <br>Those of you who are ready to die because of your children; when you see "hell", you will not trust anybody.
    <br>Some of you here are ready to die because of your children.
    <br>You trust them to any length.
    <br>While even you yourself, you do not trust yourself.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Do you trust yourself?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You don't trust yourself.
    <br>If you trusted yourself, you would know who you are.
    <br>You don't know who you are.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Love everyone and trust only God.
    <br>You don't trust yourself and you say that you trust someone.
    <br>You say you trust your children...
    <br>Look at this man.
    <br>It is not his fault.
    <br>He said he was shocked when the boy answered "Yes" to the man of God saying,
    <br>"Do you know that you are in a cult?"
    <br>He was expecting his son to say, "I don't know what the meaning of cult is".
    <br>When the boy said that he was in a cult, the father was surprised.
    <br>Please, learn to trust only God and love everyone.
    <br>Leave the word "trust" to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Leave the word 'trust'"
    <br>To whom?
    <br>[To God]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Leave the word "trust" to God.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Leave the word "trust" to God.]
    <br>As of today, leave the word "trust" to only God.
    <br>Love everyone.
    <br>You may be seated.

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Mr Odinaka Achumie.
    <br>Next to me is my wife.
    <br>We come from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>God used this ministry to deliver my son, Somtochukwu Achumie, from evil attacks, through vomiting pins.
    <br>He also delivered him from the spirit of death that was in my family.
    <br>Ever since my son was delivered, there has been a big difference in his life.
    <br>If you saw him now, you would not recognise him anymore because he is now very healthy.
    <br>I want to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua whom God used mightily to deliver my family
    <br>and put away shame completely from my family.
    <br>Without the help of God, it would have been a different story altogether.
    <br>But glory be to God for making it possible that I would be among persons who would partake
    <br>in the blessings of this ministry.
    <br>Amen. To God be the glory.
    <br>And truly better is not good enough, the best is yet to come.
    <br>In this fashion, Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners count it a privilege to be able to support
    <br>your family to send your son to school.
    <br>In this case, the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners are presenting you
    <br>with a scholarship of 150,000 naira for your son.
    <br>You can take out the money.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Supports Mr & Mrs Achumie With A Scholarship Of N150,000 For Their Son
    <br>First of all, I want to thank the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I also thank the man of God for his mercy and kindness, most especially towards my family.
    <br>It is very surprising to me but I know that it is God who is doing it through him.
    <br>May God bless him, keep him, give him long life and sound health
    <br>so that he will be alive to do more for others.
    <br>It is not possible to be delivered and receive a scholarship in one place.
    <br>This is the only place where I have seen such a thing.
    <br>I did not pay a dime.
    <br>I did not even pay one naira.
    <br>Since we came here, the man of God has been taking care of us.
    <br>He provided us with accommodation and feeding all this time.
    <br>In fact, we lived like kings.
    <br>He did a lot for us, what we never even expected.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>Truly, a million thanks are not enough for what Jesus Christ has given us today.
    <br>My husband has said it all but I want to thank the God of T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I want to thank Jesus Christ who made it possible for me today to be a happy woman in this world
    <br>because satan came to steal from my house and family but the God of T.B. Joshua said, “No”.
    <br>The God of T.B. Joshua delivered my son and gave him a scholarship of N150,000.
    <br>I want to return all the glory to God.
    <br>I want to pray for Prophet T.B. Joshua that God would give him long life and lift him up.
    <br>I wish him Heaven at last.
    <br>I want to say, "Thank You, Jesus for what You have done in my family!"
    <br>I don’t know what to say; I am short of words.
    <br>But I want to say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>God of T.B. Joshua, I worship You.
    <br>I thank You, Lord, in Jesus’ name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We have no natural words to describe this kind of joy you are feeling right now, except to say,
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus Christ".
    <br>We encourage you; you are blessed and you are delivered by the Word of God.
    <br>Make God's Word the standard for your life and His rule your principle and you will see that for you
    <br>and your family better is truly not good enough - the best is yet to come, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
