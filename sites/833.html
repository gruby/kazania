    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>During the powerful mass prayer by T.B. Joshua, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>the evil spirit inside this man is severely tormented as it is scorched by the fire of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Let's hear its confession.
    <br>I am a destroyer.
    <br>The spirit of destroyer.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>A Word from God can change your situation.
    <br>A Word from God can revise your situation.
    <br>The Word from God can settle the matter.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Children of God - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Christian Attah, I'm from Kogi State.
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my lovely wife.
    <br>This is my daughter: Angel.
    <br>This is my dad: Mr. Attah.
    <br>This is my son.
    <br>This is my lovely mum: Mrs. Attah.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>I was delivered, last Sunday, when the man of God was conducting the mass prayer.
    <br>He was just praying against every evil spirit causing hindrance and setback.
    <br>We started praying that prayer along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Suddenly, where I was praying at the back, I found myself on the floor, screaming.
    <br>I wanted to remove my clothes!
    <br>By the time I came round, I found myself at the altar.
    <br>It all started on December 25th, 2004, when I was at school.
    <br>My friends took me out to a club where people were smoking and drinking.
    <br>They asked me if I was going to smoke.
    <br>I told them I hadn't smoked before and that my father didn't smoke or drink, so why would I start smoking?
    <br>They said I should forget about that because I was at school
    <br>and my parents were not with me – I needed to smoke.
    <br>From then, I started smoking.
    <br>After smoking, I began taking hard drugs and drinking alcohol.
    <br>One day, my friend took me to a place where gang members were.
    <br>At that place, where the gang members were gathering,
    <br>he told the members that he wanted to initiate me into their cult.
    <br>I said I didn’t want to join but they forced me, they gave me a drink and I was drunk.
    <br>Then, they beat me up seriously and gave me something to swallow.
    <br>Afterwards, they told me that no one should know that I belonged to a cult.
    <br>The next day, my friend called me and said that they wanted to go for an 'operation'.
    <br>He asked if I would follow them for the operation. I said no.
    <br>He said that it was my obligation to go and if I didn’t go, they would not see me as anything.
    <br>So, I went with them and they gave me a rifle.
    <br>We went to carry out the operation.
    <br>We got to a room with ladies inside, we took their phones, chains and all they had, then left.
    <br>You mean your colleagues called you and all of you went for what?
    <br>We went to do robbery.
    <br>- OK, robbery?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>When we went, we abused the ladies who didn’t want to give us their money or their chains,
    <br>then they would give us their money and we would let them go.
    <br>When we got back, we would hand over the stolen goods to the senior man in the cult.
    <br>That was how my cultism started.
    <br>It affected me so badly.
    <br>At that time, I didn’t have all these tattoos on my body.
    <br>Because I was a cult member, I started getting all these tattoos.
    <br>Look at the screen of the TV.
    <br>Our brother is confessing how these evil spirits actually tormented his entire life,
    <br>to the extent that he decided to put tattoos all over his body.
    <br>He is here to tell us the exact meaning of these tattoos.
    <br>Could you explain how you came about these tattoos and their meanings?
    <br>By the tattoo on my neck,
    <br>any cultist from my former group who sees it, would know that I was a member.
    <br>Watch the screen of the TV.
    <br>We heard him explaining - he said the very tattoo on his neck is the tattoo of identification,
    <br>indicating that he belongs to a certain secret cult.
    <br>When I started drawing all these tattoos, it affected my life badly.
    <br>Sometimes, the spirit would push me to go and smoke and rob.
    <br>Especially this tattoo by my eye.
    <br>If I didn’t have money, my eyes would be red.
    <br>I would start looking for money to take drugs.
    <br>What is the meaning of the tattoo on your eyes?
    <br>These are 'tears of joy'.
    <br>OK, you call it 'tears of joy'?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Are they really tears of joy?
    <br>To me, it doesn’t mean tears of joy but tears of sorrow.
    <br>Because I collected something by force that didn’t belong to me.
    <br>It means sorrow to me.
    <br>You mean, they are 'tears of sorrow'?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Because you go about harassing people, and taking their things by force?
    <br>Even if my dad was talking to me, he could not look at my eyes, I would get angry.
    <br>If I was fighting with my friends, only until I saw blood, before my eyes would come down.
    <br>OK, in the course of your testimony you said you were fond of collecting things from people by force.
    <br>What do you mean by that?
    <br>Stealing people's money – I would use everything I had to collect money by force.
    <br>What were the weapons you used?
    <br>We used knives, guns and sometimes, we would use sticks as if they were guns.
    <br>Continue.
    <br>When I would come home, my younger ones would see me smoking and drinking.
    <br>That spirit influenced them and now, they are smoking even more than me.
    <br>I didn’t have any way to control them, I am the eldest in the house.
    <br>The way I behaved, they were learning from me; now, I'm delivered, I can see that those things are not good.
    <br>When I see my younger ones smoking and drinking, it's very painful because it destroys;
    <br>it doesn’t make someone move forward but backwards.
    <br>OK, can you just tell us how these evil spirits actually affected your relationship with your wife?
    <br>Sometimes, I would go out and by the time I got in, my wife would ask me
    <br>why I was going out to drink that it wasn’t good, I should consider that she was pregnant.
    <br>I would just look at her in annoyance and start beating her seriously.
    <br>There was a time I beat her to the extent that blood started flowing out of her.
    <br>You mean this demon that tormented your life made you to beat up your wife, even when she was pregnant?
    <br>Yes, I used to beat her.
    <br>Anything she said, even if it was very minor that spirit would
    <br>come into me and tell me to beat my wife and kill her.
    <br>I would press her neck, until my parents would come and rescue her from my hand.
    <br>You mean you did beat her to the extent that she was bleeding whilst she was pregnant?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You never felt any kind of remorse?
    <br>That was then, I didn’t regret anything but now I am delivered, I don’t beat my wife any more.
    <br>OK, hold on.
    <br>Before we go to your experience after your deliverance, we have questions to ask you.
    <br>Let's come to your mum and your dad.
    <br>How did these evil spirits affect your relationship with your mum and your dad?
    <br>The evil spirit affected my mum's business so much because of the things I was doing,
    <br>they would call me to ask why I was doing all these things.
    <br>I even went somewhere to do a charm for my dad
    <br>so that anyone who wanted to help my dad should not help him.
    <br>I did that because of the day he called police and had me arrested.
    <br>This was the reason why I did it - that he would not see help from anywhere.
    <br>OK, could you just tell us what led your father to carry out that action on you?
    <br>What were you doing to your dad?
    <br>Tell us how these evil spirits affected your relationship with your dad.
    <br>I didn’t respect him; I didn’t even see him as my dad.
    <br>It was to the extent that if he wanted to slap me, I would hold him too and wanted to fight back.
    <br>It even led to misunderstanding between my mum and dad.
    <br>My dad said that he would disown me and I was not the only son he had.
    <br>But my mum didn’t agree and that was how everything happened.
    <br>OK. Now, can we come to when you were delivered?
    <br>How did you come to know about The SCOAN?
    <br>And when you came - tell us what happened to you.
    <br>It was my mum who forced me to The SCOAN!
    <br>Last Sunday, when I was in the church, the evil spirit told me that I should go and I did.
    <br>When I left, my mum was looking for me all over, then she sent my younger one to look for me.
    <br>My younger one saw me and called me back inside; when I came back,
    <br>the spirit was pushing me to go out and smoke, asking me why I was staying in the church.
    <br>When I came back, my mum was angry with me and asked me why I went out.
    <br>I didn’t even answer her.
    <br>During the mass prayer, I didn’t know what came over me.
    <br>There was something like fire that was burning inside me, so I wanted to take off my clothes!
    <br>I wanted to run away but I felt chained down; the Spirit of God did not allow me to go out.
    <br>Eventually, I fell down and saw myself at the altar.
    <br>OK, can you tell us - ever since you have been delivered,
    <br>what are the changes you have noticed in your life and in relations with your family?
    <br>Now, I love my wife; we are on good terms.
    <br>I no longer go out with friends, I even broke my SIM, so those bad friends can't call me again.
    <br>I don't go out.
    <br>When my mum is talking to me now, I always listen to her.
    <br>This tattoo on my arm, I used it to deceive ladies.
    <br>Sometimes, I would take a lady out, telling her that I wanted to help her.
    <br>I would take her to a hotel room and she would think it was only me who wanted to sleep with her
    <br>but when we got to the hotel room, we would drug her
    <br>and she would not know what was happening, a group of us would abuse her.
    <br>This tattoo is the head of an eagle.
    <br>OK, the head of an eagle?
    <br>Since I am delivered, I no longer smoke.
    <br>The day I was delivered, I had a dream.
    <br>I saw my friends in a place where they were smoking.
    <br>They called me to join them to smoke and I went.
    <br>I took a drag of a cigarette and took a second one;
    <br>on the third drag, I was about to take, something started coming out of my nose.
    <br>Then, a voice told me to look at my left.
    <br>When I looked at my left, I saw worldly people, then I looked at my right
    <br>I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua holding my hand.
    <br>Holding my hand, Prophet T.B. Joshua took me to a room where people were singing praises.
    <br>Someone was sat on a throne and there was light.
    <br>I asked the man of God if I could see the person sitting on the throne.
    <br>He asked if I had eyes to see and if God gave me eyes to see the person, would I be able to stand?
    <br>I said that I wanted to see the person.
    <br>Next, I heard a loud voice from the throne.
    <br>He said, "Christian, do you know the meaning of Christian?"
    <br>I said no. He said, Christian is Christ-like and that I needed to follow the way of Christ.
    <br>That is the meaning of Christian.
    <br>Then, I woke up from the dream.
    <br>Wow, shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>This is a clear proof that indeed the deliverance the brother has received here,
    <br>at The SCOAN, the arena of liberty, is genuine.
    <br>Of course, the dream has gone as far as telling him the meaning of being a Christian.
    <br>This means a Christ-like person.
    <br>In other words he should make the Word of God the standard for his life
    <br>and follow Jesus Christ for the rest of his life.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully.
    <br>Now, as you are completely delivered - can you tell us how you relate with your mum, dad and wife?
    <br>We are all happy now and things I didn’t do for my mum before, I am doing now.
    <br>Now, we are at peace and between me and my wife there is peace.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that.
    <br>Madam, welcome in Jesus' name.
    <br>We believe this is a day of your joy.
    <br>Could you just tell us your name and your own side of the story?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Rita Attah, I'm from Kogi State.
    <br>People of God - my testimony goes like this:
    <br>when I met my husband, he was smoking, drinking, womanising, always going to clubs.
    <br>I didn't know that my husband was acting like that after having taken different drugs.
    <br>Each time I asked him about this going out he would start beating me up.
    <br>He would lay his hand on me even while I was pregnant.
    <br>The reason for which I am here is to testify that my husband does not do those things any more.
    <br>The smoking, drinking, going out to clubs, womanising - my husband does not do those things any more.
    <br>My husband stays at home, ministers the Anointing Water, reads the Bible and prays - he gathers our family...
    <br>Mrs Rita Attah
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>Let's hear from the father of your husband.
    <br>People of God - Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Samson Attah, I'm from Kogi State.
    <br>Today is a great day for me.
    <br>I've suffered a lot because of my first son.
    <br>My son was born in 1985.
    <br>My son was well till the age of eleven years.
    <br>When I moved to Lagos, I started to notice something about my son.
    <br>When I called him, he wouldn't answer my call.
    <br>There was no respect.
    <br>I told my wife that I noticed something about our son - Christian.
    <br>He would not even like to attend the morning devotion.
    <br>The rest of children would attend the morning devotion.
    <br>Whenever I called him to attend morning devotion, he wouldn't like to answer me.
    <br>I started to notice some things.
    <br>He changed entirely at the age of 15, after finishing secondary school.
    <br>I told him I didn't like his friends, that he should go away from them, and their way of living was bad.
    <br>Then the battle between me and my son began.
    <br>When I advised him like that, he would insult me.
    <br>When he began to insult me, the younger son would attack him.
    <br>One day, when he was insulting me, I slapped him and he held my hand and wanted to beat me.
    <br>The junior one insulted him and he was holding him.
    <br>Because of that he made a comment that he would call a gang, and I would not see that boy again,
    <br>and the following day I would see him dead on the street.
    <br>I called my wife and I said that this boy had gone far towards "something".
    <br>One day I came while he was sleeping...
    <br>The tattoo on the arm was his first one.
    <br>When I saw the tattoo, I asked my son what the meaning of it was.
    <br>He started telling me that this didn't concern me, and I should not ask him.
    <br>One day, he gathered a group of people - cult members on the street.
    <br>They were fighting with broken bottles and jumping over the fence.
    <br>Then, my junior son came - he saw that Christian and his group wanted to kill someone.
    <br>I was laying on my bed.
    <br>When I got up, I looked through the window and I saw him and people that were coming.
    <br>I fainted.
    <br>I did not know what was happening for more than one hour.
    <br>I saw those things: the broken bottles, someone being injured - so I fainted.
    <br>Then I told my wife that I would report this boy to the police, so they would arrest him.
    <br>Since he wanted to kill the junior son, one day we might not see our son any more.
    <br>My wife said that we should wait and not go to the police.
    <br>I said OK.
    <br>After that he started again.
    <br>I called him - he refused to come.
    <br>And now the worst thing happened - he polluted the minds of the junior ones.
    <br>They used to come to the morning devotion before - he told them many things.
    <br>Those who were not smoking before started to smoke.
    <br>Those that had not been stealing before - he told them how to make money faster than me, as a father, did.
    <br>When I called them, they did not listen to me any more.
    <br>Everything was tough between me and him.
    <br>One day, I told him that I would disown him.
    <br>He started fighting me.
    <br>Then I met with my second son and my wife.
    <br>The three of us tried to keep and beat him - we couldn't do that.
    <br>Then I escaped because he was focused on me.
    <br>Whatever I did or said, it was like fire for him.
    <br>He didn't want to see me at all.
    <br>I told my wife...
    <br>One day he gathered some people to kill me because I was the one giving him a tough time.
    <br>I was the one troubling him - he wanted to kill me.
    <br>When this information came to me, I escaped because this boy with other people was ready to kill me.
    <br>It was last year - January 11th - I made up my mind to quit my house.
    <br>That day I run away to Ghana.
    <br>I went to my friend and stayed there to save my life.
    <br>I told my wife that I would not come back until this boy was delivered.
    <br>Otherwise he would take my life.
    <br>When I went to Ghana, I asked my friend - we began to pray.
    <br>This is my first son - I have suffered a lot; all my businesses collapsed.
    <br>There was no one to take care of my business.
    <br>There was no money for me anymore.
    <br>We continued to pray.
    <br>I was praying for my first son to be delivered; Christian to be delivered -
    <br>that was my prayer point number one.
    <br>I, my friend and his wife were praying together three weeks ago.
    <br>Then our Prophet appeared to me in the dream.
    <br>That was three weeks ago.
    <br>Prophet said, "Son, you should not worry. The answer to your prayer has come. The whole thing is settled."
    <br>Immediately I heard that voice, I woke up.
    <br>In the morning I called my wife.
    <br>I said that I had been praying and that I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua in my dream.
    <br>He said that the case of my son Christian was settled and that I should take all of them to the church.
    <br>Since the Prophet said the case was settled, I believed it.
    <br>Last Sunday, my wife brought all of them here.
    <br>I started with Emmanuel TV
    <br>because Emmanuel TV is my friend, mother, father, wife, it is my everything.
    <br>I sleep and wake up with Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Last Sunday in the morning I was watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was watching the prayer, the testimonies...
    <br>When the man of God appeared and prophesied to people, I asked God, "Please, locate my son".
    <br>As I was watching, I saw some people coming out.
    <br>One lady came out, then another lady came out.
    <br>I continued to pray.
    <br>I opened my eyes and I saw my son in the front of the altar.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>When they brought him out, he was saying, "I destroy, I destroy".
    <br>I started to see all these things.
    <br>I said, "God - You are wonderful".
    <br>As he entered the arena of liberty, all the problems were settled.
    <br>That is how I gave thanks to my God.
    <br>When I was in Lagos, my son didn't talk to me, he didn't call me, he didn't want to see me.
    <br>After I went to Ghana, he didn't call me even once, he didn't think about me.
    <br>On Tuesday morning...
    <br>You mean after his deliverance?
    <br>After his deliverance on Sunday.
    <br>On Monday...
    <br>On Tuesday in the morning there was I call.
    <br>Since my son was not calling me, I didn't know his number.
    <br>I didn't even think about my son.
    <br>The only call I was expecting from Nigeria was from my wife.
    <br>I used to talk with my wife every day.
    <br>So the call came in.
    <br>He said, "Good morning, daddy".
    <br>I asked, "Who is this?"
    <br>I asked, "Is it Israel?"
    <br>He said, "No. I'm Christian - your first son".
    <br>I answered, "Mr. Attah speaking. Is it a mistake?"
    <br>Mr Samson Attah & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I said, "No. It might be a wrong number. This is Mr. Attah talking. Who are you?"
    <br>He said, "I'm Christian - your first son. It is not a mistake.
    <br>I collected your number from my mum on Monday."
    <br>I said, "You!?"
    <br>He said, "Yes."
    <br>I said, "Yes, my prayer has been answered because I saw you."
    <br>Mr Samson Attah & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>God has answered my prayer.
    <br>Because God spoke to me in the dream through Prophet T.B. Joshua saying that the case was settled,
    <br>I knew that the case was settled.
    <br>My son said, "Dad, I want you to come to Nigeria. I want to sit down and discuss with you."
    <br>I asked, "Should I come?"
    <br>I was not sure because maybe he had gathered some gang to attack me - so I had to call my wife.
    <br>I called my wife.
    <br>I told my wife that I had a call from Christian.
    <br>He said that I should come to Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>I asked my wife if it was indeed him with her.
    <br>She said, "He asked me for your number and I gave it to him."
    <br>I asked, "Have you confirmed that nothing would happen to me if I returned?"
    <br>She said, "Yes, you should come - it is confirmed."
    <br>I came back in the night.
    <br>Since all these things started, he never hugged me.
    <br>That day I came - Wednesday - when I reached the house, he was the first person than run and hugged me.
    <br>Mr Samson Attah & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>When he hugged me, I looked at him and started shedding tears.
    <br>Yesterday he came to me.
    <br>He didn't discuss anything with me before.
    <br>When he came to me, he said, "Dad, if you have any dirty clothes for me to wash and iron for you...
    <br>On Sunday we will go to church."
    <br>I said, "I ironed all my clothes before coming back from Ghana. So, there is no problem".
    <br>I said to him that if he wanted us to go to the church, I was ready to go.
    <br>He said, "OK".
    <br>These things have not been seen before.
    <br>It used to be like cat and rat, lion in the house.
    <br>Everything was disorganized.
    <br>This boy used to beat his pregnant wife.
    <br>That was before he was delivered?
    <br>That was before he was delivered.
    <br>Now, when his wife carries water to the bathroom, they go together, bathing together...
    <br>It is wonderful.
    <br>I am happy today.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Once again, let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>Yes sir, we will get back to you to hear your words of advice, especially to parents,
    <br>but before, we want to hear from the mum.
    <br>God is wonderful.
    <br>Especially, the God of T.B. Joshua is a wonderful God.
    <br>My name is Mrs Attah.
    <br>The boy beside me is my first son and his wife.
    <br>This is my loving husband.
    <br>Because of my son, our love divided but I am thanking God today.
    <br>My testimony goes like this.
    <br>When I married my husband, his grandfather was the one who married us.
    <br>His grandfather was a native doctor.
    <br>When I was pregnant, I gave birth to a baby boy who is this Christian Attah.
    <br>Seven days after his birth, we gave him the name of the grandfather
    <br>which was the first name before we gave him Christian.
    <br>We gave him the name Abata.
    <br>When my son grew to about five years old, ten, eleven and fourteen, he started behaving waywardly.
    <br>When he went out, sometimes three days would pass before he came home.
    <br>They used to call me and say that my son was fighting somewhere.
    <br>When I got there, I would see my son with a glass bottle or a knife fighting.
    <br>I would hold Christian and ask him what his problem was.
    <br>When we finished secondary school, we asked Christian what he wanted to do.
    <br>He replied that he wanted to be a solider.
    <br>I said he should join but I did not know that the army he joined
    <br>was doing armed robbery and putting tattoos on his body.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua began the mass prayer, God Almighty arrested my son.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Since your son has been delivered, what are the changes you have seen in his life?
    <br>Since that Sunday when my son was delivered, I have been happy.
    <br>What my son couldn’t ask me for before, he now asks me.
    <br>First of all, he asked me for his dad's phone number.
    <br>Since then, my son's character has changed.
    <br>He doesn’t go out anymore.
    <br>Sometimes, he calls his junior ones to sit down with them and talk to them.
    <br>This is what my son would never do before.
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ!
    <br>Yes, we thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life, in the life of your son and also the entire family.
    <br>Now, what word of advice do you have for parents and everyone?
    <br>I pray that God will answer those who have the same problem I once had,
    <br>in the same way He answered me, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>Now, let's hear the word of advice from Christian.
    <br>My word of advice goes like this.
    <br>In Romans 12:1 it says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren…
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>You can see the whole church is happy with you.
    <br>I believe that is how the Kingdom of Heaven is rejoicing because of your deliverance.
    <br>In Romans 12:1 it says, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God,
    <br>that we may present our bodies holy and acceptable unto God."
    <br>So, what I want to tell the youth is to present themselves in a way that is acceptable to God.
    <br>The worldly things I was into before don’t make sense.
    <br>Now, I thank God that He delivered me and the same God that delivered me will deliver you too.
    <br>The same Christian that was carrying cutlass, guns and knife is now carrying the Holy Bible.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Let's hear finally from your dad - a word of advice.
    <br>The word of my advice is that as parents we should monitor our children - the way they behave.
    <br>I want you to know that this battle for our children is not physical.
    <br>I have "used" police, my strength, the strength of my wife, my junior son, and everybody -
    <br>but prayer is the answer!
    <br>If anything affects your children, go into prayer.
    <br>That is my advice to all parents.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Indeed, prayer is the master key to loose and to bind.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has accomplished first and foremost
    <br>in the life of your son Christian and the entire family.
    <br>I also want you to know that as much as your son is delivered through the Word of God,
    <br>we believe he has started the journey of salvation by making the Word of God
    <br>the standard for his life and of course for the entire family.
    <br>Always have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough - the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Mr Christian Attah & Family
