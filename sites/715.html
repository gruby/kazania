    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We shall talk about a very important issue - it has to do with relationships.
    <br>Natural, human relationships are very important.
    <br>That is why we are here today.
    <br>I am talking to you here and now because you are there, listening to me.
    <br>If you were not there, listening to me, I couldn't come here and be talking to the air.
    <br>Viewers at home, I say I am talking to you because I believe you are there listening,
    <br>paying attention to me.
    <br>I want to say thank you for that.
    <br>This is the message for today:
    <br>"LET GOD RELEASE YOU"
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>"Let God release you"
    <br>In your business.
    <br>In your relationships.
    <br>Regular relationships, such as marriage, business or even friendship
    <br>can break out of sheer circumstances - just like that!
    <br>And the origin of relationship is God.
    <br>Until God releases us, we cannot quit the relationship.
    <br>But today, it does not take us anything!
    <br>Just disagreement, misunderstanding or conflict - we quit the relationship.
    <br>You cannot do it alone.
    <br>You keep quitting relationships - business partners, marriage or friendships.
    <br>You move from one church to another just like that - it doesn't take you anything.
    <br>Without God releasing you, when are we going to settle with relationship?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask yourself. When are you going to settle with a relationship?
    <br>You can count how many business partners you have had in the past, or friends.
    <br>The Bible says that relationship begins with God, and then to humans.
    <br>Relationship begins with God, and then to humans.
    <br>If relationship begins with God, we cannot just quit from it under any circumstance.
    <br>Something that you are not the origin of - you cannot just quit under any circumstance.
    <br>Unless you are released, you cannot just quit from it.
    <br>And you know, God can speak through disagreement.
    <br>God can speak through conflict, through tribulation or adversity -
    <br>God can speak through them; He can speak joy through sadness.
    <br>If God does not release us and we quit the relationship
    <br>because of disagreement, misunderstanding, conflict or whatever,
    <br>the way you quit is the way you will enter the next relationship.
    <br>Unless you are released...
    <br>We don't leave a relationship as a Christian because of fight, disagreement, conflict or adversity.
    <br>We don't leave relationships
    <br>because the man that is your enemy today can be your saviour tomorrow.
    <br>Look at many of you that are in the church today.
    <br>You know what you have said about this Ministry before now, or what you have done about this Ministry.
    <br>But today, you are here.
    <br>Let me quickly take you to the message from the Book of John 20:23.
    <br>"If you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven;
    <br>if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."
    <br>What the Bible is saying here is that if you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven,
    <br>but if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.
    <br>This means, we preserve the sins of other people when we pick up an offence and harbour resentment.
    <br>It is impossible to establish a healthy relationship, a good relationship
    <br>with a person who has left another relationship resentful and offended.
    <br>Someone who breaks a relationship because of misunderstanding or conflict now becomes your friend.
    <br>There is no friendship there; you are destroyed.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>This is my brother; we are friends, but something happens and we start fighting.
    <br>"What happened? You are foolish!"
    <br>Maybe I am wrong or right, or you are wrong or right.
    <br>We have no right to go with that conflict and establish another relationship.
    <br>If we now decide not to come together, and I now have another friend here, this man is in trouble.
    <br>The relationship we were going to establish is purely disease, affliction
    <br>because I have a broken relationship here, with misunderstanding and disagreement; it is unsettled.
    <br>But now you are my friend, and you too must have had your own somewhere and we come together.
    <br>Can you see the reason why we are facing relationships that are neither lasting nor rewarding?
    <br>This is why you end up with relationships without reward.
    <br>Because you fight this one, you end up the relationship and look for other friends.
    <br>Remember you carry conflict, hatred, bitterness, offence and become the friend of another person.
    <br>And that person too may also have a broken relationship somewhere.
    <br>The two of you are together - can you see the life you are living?
    <br>And you cannot succeed alone; you need people, you need friends.
    <br>Jesus knew this; that was why He had disciples.
    <br>He would not have been able to succeed alone.
    <br>It is impossible to establish a healthy, good relationship
    <br>with a person who has left another relationship bitter and offended.
    <br>You can never have a healthy, rewarding relationship.
    <br>This is why today when you see a broken home - a divorced woman or man marry someone,
    <br>they will still also divorce, at least 90% of them
    <br>because of the carry over they have, where they are coming from.
    <br>If God releases you, you will not be under pressure to judge.
    <br>To be under pressure is to be under the control of our circumstances -
    <br>allowing situations to control, mislead and overwhelm us.
    <br>If you are released, you will go with joy, even in the face of adversity.
    <br>As a good example, you know that attending church is a thing of God.
    <br>But today - someone just brought you here today, someone just told you there are miracles here.
    <br>That is why you are here.
    <br>Someone just told you that a woman you have been looking for for many years is attending this church.
    <br>That is why you are here today.
    <br>Someone just told you that your Chairman is a member of this church - that is why you are here today.
    <br>Someone just told you that the man you are looking for a contract from is a member of this church.
    <br>That is why you are here today.
    <br>Attending church is a thing of God.
    <br>When we go to church, we are answering God's invitation.
    <br>Do not leave under any circumstance because it is God's invitation.
    <br>Don't pull out of the church or a relationship under any circumstance -
    <br>disagreement, misunderstanding or taking offences, whether you are right or wrong,
    <br>we should let God release us.
    <br>If God releases you, even in the face of crisis, you will go with joy.
    <br>In the Book of Isaiah 55:12, it says you will go with joy.
    <br>Every Christian should realise that where God wants them to be,
    <br>the devil will want to offend them to pull out.
    <br>If you are in a place where God wants you to be, the devil will want to offend you to pull out.
    <br>The devil is always interested in where God wants you to be, where God wants you to go,
    <br>where God wants you to sit and what God wants you to say.
    <br>Any time you wake up and you are going to your business and you start receiving attack,
    <br>or something happens like an accident - don't give up, go there.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>If your relationship with your wife or your friend is being attacked,
    <br>or if your business is being attacked so much,
    <br>know that that is where God wants you to be.
    <br>If you are in a place where God wants you, the devil will want to offend you to pull out.
    <br>You have abandoned a business that would have put you on the world map, because of attacks.
    <br>You have abandoned a relationship that would have built your future and career, because of attacks.
    <br>You have abandoned...
    <br>Think of the many things you have abandoned because of attacks and threats to your life.
    <br>A business that would have put you on the world map, you abandoned it.
    <br>Because of so much debt, so much loss, you abandoned it.
    <br>That is what God wants you to do! The devil knows; that is why he is attacking you.
    <br>You abandoned something that would have changed your life.
    <br>The business that would have changed you forever, you abandoned it because of attacks.
    <br>Friends that would have helped you, you abandoned them because of conflict or trouble.
    <br>Wives, a place that would have changed you forever, you stopped because of attacks and trouble.
    <br>Think about that.
    <br>Enemy? Who is that enemy? You are the enemy of yourself.
    <br>Why can't I abandon The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations with what has been happening to me?
    <br>How do you know that what you are doing now is the right thing, where God wants you to be?
    <br>Don't try to make it easy for the devil.
    <br>You are making it easy for the devil.
    <br>Stay where you are! Don't budge!
    <br>Stay where you are.
    <br>In times of great conflict, stay where you are, don't budge.
    <br>Don't make it easy for the devil.
    <br>You are making it easy for the devil.
    <br>You are making it so simple for the devil to get what he wants.
    <br>These are common problems.
    <br>This is why we do not wait patiently for God's release.
    <br>Rather, it is trouble that releases us from relationships.
    <br>It is trouble that releases us from our marriage; it is trouble that releases us from our business partner.
    <br>Think back over your journey. You will know...
    <br>We do not wait patiently for God's release in our regular relationships.
    <br>Rather, it is our circumstances that release us.
    <br>This is why we are always facing relationships that are neither lasting nor rewarding.
    <br>You cannot succeed alone; you need people.
    <br>But to get good people, you must work through bad to get good.
    <br>My Bible makes me to understand that when you are looking for good,
    <br>you can't just find it by merely stretching your hand.
    <br>My Bible makes me to understand that you go through bad, worse before you can find good.
    <br>This is why the Bible says, "Find out the truth".
    <br>You must do some work before you can get the truth.
    <br>To get the truth, you must go through wrong and falsehood before getting to the truth.
    <br>Find out the truth and the truth shall set you free.
    <br>It doesn't say, "Get the truth".
    <br>As Christians, we should see situations such as conflict, hurt or all forms of offences
    <br>as God's way to strengthen our character.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "See situations such as conflict, hurt or all forms of offences
    <br>as God's way to strengthen our character".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Situations should not release us from our regular relationships.
    <br>See what situations have done in your life.
    <br>It was the situation that destroyed your marriage,
    <br>the same situation that destroyed your business.
    <br>Because of fights, disagreements, "he's a thief!", "he's a fraudster!", "he's a criminal!"
    <br>You receive a phone call, "He has duped you!"
    <br>If he duped you, it is not enough for you to leave the business.
    <br>Stay and get used to the situation - the situation will mature you.
    <br>Our situations are tests to mature us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let go of your past.
    <br>Let go of this moment because another moment is coming.
    <br>If I am going in this direction, whatever I encounter on my way, I should let go
    <br>because I am going to meet another moment.
    <br>Every moment, let go.
    <br>At this moment somebody slaps me.
    <br>OK, I'm not going to stay there, I am going forward to another moment.
    <br>I should let go so that I can deal with this moment.
    <br>I'm going. Yes, see me going.
    <br>At this moment, what happened? Somebody hit me.
    <br>OK, if I still want to go forward, I should let go of this moment.
    <br>Because if I don't let this moment go and I move to another moment and somebody slaps me again,
    <br>and I am still carrying this slap of yesterday, today again -
    <br>you know what it means when you have a "carry over" -
    <br>it is not a good thing; carry over in your school is a very bad thing.
    <br>You know you cannot succeed alone, you cannot do without friends,
    <br>you cannot do without business partners - it is not possible.
    <br>Even our Lord Jesus Christ knew this; that was why He had twelve disciples.
    <br>He had His disciples and distributed assignments to them
    <br>because He knew He would not be able to succeed alone.
    <br>So also you, there is nothing you can do alone.
    <br>There is nothing. If there is anything you can do alone, let me know.
    <br>So, you need people - I mean you need good people.
    <br>But to get those good people, you go through bad, bad, bad before you get the good.
    <br>If you are looking for good and you don't want to deal with bad people, you can never get it -
    <br>because the Bible says, "Find out..."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No matter what you are going through in your relationship,
    <br>remember - that relationship begins with God.
    <br>If the relationship begins with God, it means that no matter what you are going through,
    <br>it should not release you from that relationship.
    <br>Let God release you.
    <br>If you had been waiting patiently for God to release you all this while,
    <br>I know that the sky would have been your limit.
    <br>Many things you see as bad - behind the bad, there is good.
    <br>A friend you see as a bad guy is the saviour God sent to rescue you tomorrow.
    <br>He may be bad today, but tomorrow he is another person.
    <br>Let God release you.
    <br>Look at many marriages today.
    <br>It was this great crisis or conflict that separated many of them.
    <br>Yet they have still not met the loved one they are looking for.
    <br>Ask anyone who is in this situation and they will tell you that they are managing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "They are managing".
    <br>We are dealing not only with the hurt that took place in the new relationship,
    <br>but also with the hurt from the former relationship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "We are dealing not only with the hurt that took place in the new relationship,
    <br>but with the hurt from the former relationship."
    <br>Two hurts - the way you left this relationship and the way you will enter the new relationship.
    <br>It is a carry over. That is life.
    <br>The hurt of the former relationship and the new one, all together.
    <br>I know you will be very surprised to hear this from me:
    <br>The business that would have turned you around, you abandoned it because of circumstances.
    <br>A friend who would have helped you in life, in the past, you abandoned because of adversaries.
    <br>Can I ask a question?
    <br>How do we have a healthy relationship?
    <br>We know that it is impossible to establish a relationship with a person
    <br>who has left another relationship bitter and offended.
    <br>It is impossible to establish a relationship with a person who has left another relationship bitter and offended.
    <br>How does this message appeal to you?
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>How does the message appeal to you, sir?
    <br>Usually, there will be a lot of carry over and the temptation is always there
    <br>to judge the new relationship with the mistakes of the former relationship.
    <br>This always brings up bitterness.
    <br>In fact I witnessed a marriage where the new wife, whatever she does, the husband always refers back,
    <br>"Why are you behaving like this other woman?", always remembering the experiences of the past marriage.
    <br>It is like a multiplication of the effect.
    <br>It is not always the best. This is my advice.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Ok, let's hear from you, sir.
    <br>First of all, I must confess that the sermon today was for me, from the start to the end.
    <br>Yesterday, I arrived from Sierra Leone.
    <br>Even before coming to The Synagogue, I have been praying.
    <br>I had previously set my time to come but didn't have time to come because of other engagements.
    <br>The marriage aspect, it has to do with me.
    <br>The business aspect, it has to do with me as well.
    <br>And the business aspect is even recent.
    <br>Concerning the marriage aspect, I just want to say that from the time the man of God entered here,
    <br>what I asked God for is what he is telling me, so I want to thank God.
    <br>You know it is really excruciating - you cannot compare it to anything else in this world, even losing money -
    <br>when you lose a relationship you have strived so much to keep.
    <br>Thank you, clap for him. Thank you very much, brother.
    <br>Lastly - I want you to go over it again - harbouring offences too long without forgiveness,
    <br>the result is a life of self-imposed isolation, self-centredness and total caging.
    <br>Harbouring offences too long without forgiveness,
    <br>the result is a life of self-imposed isolation, self-centredness and total caging.
    <br>How do we know that we have not forgiven?
    <br>You say you have forgiven, but how do we know you have not yet forgiven?
    <br>The little time you talk, you refer to the issue.
    <br>You keep referring to your loss, but you never refer to your gain.
    <br>You keep referring to your loss, but you will never refer to your gain -
    <br>we know you are harbouring offence, without forgiveness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You keep referring to your loss; you never refer to your gain.
    <br>You keep referring to your failure; you never refer to your success.
    <br>Harbouring offences too long without forgiveness,
    <br>the result is a life of self-imposed isolation, self-centredness and total caging".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You keep referring to your loss; you never refer to your gain".
