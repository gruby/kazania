  <p>    
    <br>The Bible says prophets are sent to utter the deep things of God for the conviction of sin,
    <br>for edification and comfort to the people of God.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is used by God to speak words of prophecy into peoples lives, exposing and destroying
    <br>the plan of satan against them, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>As the man of God was ministering, the power of God fell upon this lady and her deliverance began.
    <br>Let's watch what happened next, as the name of Jesus Christ worked in the spirit.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Leave her.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I destroyed her.
    <br>She is your daughter?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am her spiritual husband.
    <br>I have scattered everything about her.
    <br>Go and stand with your daughter.
    <br>She does not know anything.
    <br>I don’t want her to be great.
    <br>I have destroyed her.
    <br>[How have you destroyed her?]
    <br>She does not know anything.
    <br>I have scattered her destiny.
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>Destiny has been scattered.
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>She does not know anything.
    <br>She is over; she is finished.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I just want to destroy her because her star is great.
    <br>Come on, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come here!
    <br>When I count to two - your knee on the floor!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Leave her like that.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>She is free.
    <br>The Holy Spirit casts the demon out and she is given a new heart and desire to follow Jesus Christ.
    <br>Her deliverance is complete.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Joana Agboga, I am from Edo State but I reside in Abuja.
    <br>I'm a student.
    <br>I came to thank God for delivering me from the evil spirit that caused me to bedwet,
    <br>steal, lie, be angry and very stubborn.
    <br>I started bedwetting from when I was small.
    <br>When I would bedwet, I'd wake up and feel that the bed was wet and stand up.
    <br>Most times, I would cry and tell my mum.
    <br>It was every night.
    <br>It had been happening on a day to day basis.
    <br>As for the stealing, I would go to a supermarket with a huge sum of money
    <br>but pick up something worth 50 or 20 naira and leave.
    <br>I would not use it.
    <br>I would just take it and throw it away; sometimes, I would keep it.
    <br>I had the spirit of anger.
    <br>I used to get angry at any little thing.
    <br>When I got angry, I would bang the door on my mum.
    <br>If someone hid money in the house, something would tell me where the money was.
    <br>I would go there and get the money no matter where they hid it.
    <br>The evil spirit would tell me where the money was and I would steal it.
    <br>The lack of knowledge: before exams, I would read but during the exams, everything would black out.
    <br>Tell me, what other evil things remain?
    <br>Look - what a beautiful girl.
    <br>She is bedwetting all the time, she steals...
    <br>She can enter the supermarket and steal something.
    <br>When she sleeps she bedwetts everywhere, all the time!
    <br>She can't travel, she can't go anywhere, she steals...
    <br>The bedwetting had affected me in many ways.
    <br>I could not go to my sister's house and ask to stay or go to my cousin's house.
    <br>I could not go anywhere because of the bedwetting.
    <br>I was always not happy, which was not a good thing at all.
    <br>This stealing - does it mean that your parents are poor and that is why you steal,
    <br>or it was something you could not resist?
    <br>Tell us.
    <br>My mum and dad gave me whatever I wanted.
    <br>I would go to the supermarket with a huge sum of money but pick something worth 10 or 20 naira.
    <br>How this thing comes to you?
    <br>The voice would direct me to go, that I would not be caught stealing.
    <br>There is a voice?
    <br>Yes, Sir.
    <br>You listen to that.
    <br>She said her parents gave her everything, more than what was stolen.
    <br>They have enough.
    <br>Even if she had 10 000 naira or 5 000 dollars in the pocket
    <br>she would still enter the supermarket and steal 1 dollar.
    <br>Does it make sense?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "if you fail to realise that there are powers that cause one
    <br>to be bowed down in bondage, you will fight the wrong battle."
    <br>Now, she has 5 000 but you will see her going to the supermarket and taking 1 dollar.
    <br>What does she want to use 1 dollar for - somebody who has 5 000 dollars in the pocket?
    <br>What does she want to use it for?
    <br>That is to tell you that this is beyond human comprehension.
    <br>Ordinarily it is beyond...
    <br>There is a force that wants her to be humiliated.
    <br>There is a force that wants her to be embarrassed.
    <br>There is a force that wants her to be killed.
    <br>There is a force that wants her to be imprisoned.
    <br>There is a force that wants her to be out of circulation.
    <br>If I am talking to you let me see your hand.
    <br>There is a force.
    <br>You have to stand against it.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There is a force that wants you to be disgraced.
    <br>There is a force that wants you to be condemned.
    <br>There is a force that wants you to be imprisoned.
    <br>You have to stand against it, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>If you fail to realise that there are powers that make people to be humiliated, to be embarrassed,
    <br>you will fight a wrong battle."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>There are two ways;
    <br>bedwetting to embarrass her among her colleagues, to humiliate her, to make her feel inferior.
    <br>She would not be able to talk to colleagues that know she was bedwetting.
    <br>I was in a boarding school and I would wet the bed but my classmates would cover up for me.
    <br>Every time I urinated, something would wake me that I should stand up.
    <br>Then, I would turn over that mattress and leave the room.
    <br>I didn’t like watching Emmanuel TV at all.
    <br>Whenever Emmanuel TV was on, I was not happy.
    <br>I would leave the room.
    <br>My mum had to force me to come here today.
    <br>You said you bedwetted in the boarding school and your classmates knew about this, didn't you?
    <br>Yes, Sir.
    <br>What were they saying?
    <br>Most of them would say different things; like, in the hostel, I was not able to go to their rooms.
    <br>If we were doing something in any of their rooms, I could not sleep over;
    <br>I would have to come back to my room.
    <br>Most of them would insult me; it was very embarrassing.
    <br>Now you say that you did not want to watch Emmanuel TV. Why?
    <br>Each time they put Emmanuel TV on, I would leave the room and go and listen to music or watch a movie.
    <br>Those who refuse to watch Emmanuel TV in your houses - you should know the reason why.
    <br>The sister has revealed - this is a revelation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Listen, those who don't want to see people healed...
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, rise up and walk!" - there are people that do not want to see that kind of things.
    <br>Those who do not want to see people being helped, by giving food, charity, assistance, scholarships -
    <br>they don't want to see it.
    <br>They would say, "This is fake. How can you give this thing? Where did they get the money?
    <br>By what authority is this healing of people?"
    <br>If I am talking...
    <br>Whatever authority...
    <br>I'm talking to you - by what authority are you healing people?
    <br>I doubt that power.
    <br>Me that is talking - what am I using this authority to do?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She is telling you that she hated watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>This is someone who in the past was bedwetting, stealing, because she didn't want to see
    <br>someone being delivered from stealing.
    <br>It made her feel irritated.
    <br>This is what I am doing - I steal.
    <br>If I now watch on TV someone confessing, "I am a thief" and this person would hear, "You are delivered".
    <br>And this person would later confirm that the spirit was gone.
    <br>Being a thief, I would feel very condemned and worried.
    <br>I wouldn't want to watch more, if I am not ready to stop stealing.
    <br>If I am talking to you...
    <br>I would not be able to sleep that night.
    <br>I would continue to think about it.
    <br>It is better that I do not hear people talking about stealing, being delivered from stealing,
    <br>because I'm there.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>Or, I bedwet everyday, but watching Emmanuel TV one would see somebody
    <br>being delivered from a spirit of bedwetting.
    <br>And I am not ready to come out to say people that I bedwet.
    <br>The thing would worry me; I would not be able to sleep.
    <br>It would become a burden to my spirit.
    <br>It is better for me not to watch such a program.
    <br>It is better for me to watch a movie or a program where I would see people proud to be thief, to be this or that.
    <br>That would encourage my spirit.
    <br>It is better not to watch anything that would not encourage my spirit.
    <br>My mum forced me to come to SCOAN.
    <br>They forced you to come here?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>How?
    <br>Before she booked the flight, I told my mum that I didn’t want to come.
    <br>She told me that I must come.
    <br>I said, "Mummy, I don’t want to come".
    <br>She said, "You must come".
    <br>She forced me.
    <br>When we got to the airport, they told us that we had missed the flight
    <br>but my mum begged them, that we couldn't miss the flight.
    <br>She then paid extra money and we came here.
    <br>When we got here for the Saturday service, under the canopy is where my mum was sat.
    <br>I left her there and walked around but didn't want to enter the church.
    <br>Then, she came inside the main auditorium and I followed her inside.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua located me where I had sat down and told me to stand up.
    <br>Then, the evil spirit in me started manifesting.
    <br>Since my deliverance, I have been free – no spirit telling me to steal, I have not bedwet – nothing.
    <br>I sleep and wake up peacefully.
    <br>Now, remember that she was not the one I was talking to.
    <br>I was talking to the forth person next to her.
    <br>Come on, brother.
    <br>When I'm talking to this brother, everyone around is being observed.
    <br>Everybody around, because Jesus has eyes at the back as good as those in the front.
    <br>So, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>[Nowhere.]
    <br>So, when I located this sister, I was in hurry to leave this brother and go to her.
    <br>OK, sit down.
    <br>Christianity and religion -
    <br>some people don't know the difference between Christianity and religion.
    <br>There is a difference.
    <br>Religious people are without spirituality
    <br>while Christians are born of the Spirit of God.
    <br>We are made in our heart to be Christians.
    <br>We are only made Christians by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “We are made in our heart to be Christians”.
    <br>In other words, I mean:
    <br>we are only made Christians by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.
    <br>Ever since the man of God delivered me, I have been free; I have not bedwetted.
    <br>I have not done anything, no evil spirit has told me anything.
    <br>I just sleep and wake up peacefully.
    <br>I no longer steal or bedwet.
    <br>Man of God, I thank you so much for what you have done in my life.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am so happy to be here, in your midst today.
    <br>My name is Mrs. Elizabeth Agboga, I am from Edo State, I reside in Abuja.
    <br>This girl beside me is my daughter.
    <br>She had been bedwetting since she was five years old.
    <br>When we came from Abuja to The SCOAN, she bedwet in the hotel that we lodged in.
    <br>Are you listening to that?
    <br>Can you see what a foolish thing?
    <br>God has taken it just like that - by His stripes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why there would be anyone not recognizing His death on the Calvary?
    <br>Just like that.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You need to be delivered."
    <br>Because it is the Spirit of prophet that recognises a prophet.
    <br>You cannot recognise things we are talking about.
    <br>The greatest miracle that can happen to anyone is when you begin to see what Jesus is looking at,
    <br>to go where Jesus wants you to go
    <br>and begin to look at yourself... seeing yourself having what Jesus says you have, being able to do things
    <br>Jesus says you can do.
    <br>That is the greatest miracle.
    <br>The contentment we are talking about will come.
    <br>You are not content - that is why you are running "helter skelter", no matter the miracle you receive.
    <br>Running "helter skelter", living a life of "non-contentment" will rubbish our salvation.
    <br>When you are not content there is nothing you cannot do.
    <br>It is when you are content...
    <br>No matter how little I have - I'm content, it's OK - that is what God wants me to have.
    <br>God's time is the best - then you will begin to sleep well,
    <br>you will know what to ask for in your prayer,
    <br>then you can say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>But when you said "Thank You" the last time?
    <br>When you pray, you do not remember to say "Thank You".
    <br>You only remember an immediate miracle.
    <br>All the miracles you have been receiving right from your youth - you have forgotten them.
    <br>An immediate miracle.
    <br>You are sick now - you forget your good health in the past.
    <br>You are poor now - you forget the time when you lived in abundance.
    <br>You have a nightmare - you forget the vision you have seen in the past.
    <br>Don't wait until you see the light at the end of the tunnel.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “Don't wait to say, 'Thank You' until you see light at the end of the tunnel".
    <br>You are inside a tunnel and it is dark - "I will not say 'thank You' unless I get to the end".
    <br>Definitely - you will die inside the tunnel.
    <br>Those who get to the end of the tunnel are those who say "Thank You, Jesus" right inside the tunnel.
    <br>"No matter what I'm going through - thank You, Jesus. No matter what happened - thank You, Jesus.
    <br>No matter what is happening to me - thank You, Jesus. I thank You."
    <br>They thank before they get to the end of the tunnel.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I'm talking to you...
    <br>While you are inside the tunnel, moving, trying to crawl your body in the dark, you cannot see anything,
    <br>say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Don't begin to say, "See me through".
    <br>No, there is no word of "Thank you", but "See me through".
    <br>Only when you see the light you shout, "Thank You, Jesus - I am going to The SCOAN to give the testimony".
    <br>Coming to The SCOAN to give testimony will be delayed.
    <br>But if right from the beginning of your journey in the dark you keep saying,
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus. I know You will see me through"...
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Thank You, Jesus. I know You will see me through.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. You have seen me through."
    <br>Whereas you are not yet at the end of the tunnel, you already say,
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus. I know You will see me through.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. You have seen me through.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I know You will see me through.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. You have seen me through.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I know You are aware of what I am going through.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I know You guide me. Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>These words of thanking should be more then those of asking, "Heal me".
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The words of thanks should be more than 'Heal me. Deliver me. Set me free.'"
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>If your faith is lifted up let me see your hand.
    <br>I was surprised on Sunday.
    <br>Since then my daughter has not been bedwetting.
    <br>I have been to so many places for deliverance.
    <br>Coming to this place, in just one day the bedwetting, stealing and lying stopped.
    <br>I was so surprised.
    <br>I thank God for everything in my and my children's lives.
    <br>On the last day you will stand to witness how you helped your sister to maintain the miracle.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "On the last day, she will stand to testify how she supported her daughter
    <br>to maintain the miracle."
    <br>Over to you, my hands are cleansed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You have the right over your daughter to say, "Go to the church. Go to the Bible study. Read the Bible.
    <br>Now, you are old enough - go and get married".
    <br>The choice you can make, "Go and get married, you stopped to bedwet - go get married."
    <br>But it is not the next step now.
    <br>The next step for this lady is to have the Word living in her and her living in the Word,
    <br>so that she can maintain the miracle.
    <br>After that - she can get married, she can do whatever she wants to do.
    <br>She has to marry the Word and the Word has to marry her.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “You have to marry the Word and the Word has to marry you.”
    <br>Before you get married and settle down,
    <br>you must first marry the Word and the Word must marry you.
    <br>That is a sound marriage.
    <br>These are challenges marriages face today.
    <br>Where there is no sound, solid foundation, the marriage crashes.
    <br>Marry and re-marry, broken homes everywhere - so many of such in the church today.
    <br>You consider everything by age, by status - "I have money. I am a graduate..."
    <br>No, first marry the Word and let the Word marry you.
    <br>Get married to have a settled home and a solid foundation.
    <br>Your wife will understand when the goings are tough or when they are good.
    <br>All those things that break homes, cause to scatter, to argue, to divorce - they would understand that all
    <br>this would come, and understand what God says about whatever comes to the house - it matters.
    <br>If I am talking to you let me see your hand.
    <br>You may be seated - thank you.
    <br>My advice to parents and the viewers watching is:
    <br>they should make sure they know what their children are doing.
    <br>Some children don’t like to watch Emmanuel TV, like my own daughter.
    <br>You will know that they have an evil spirit in them.
    <br>That was the reason she was running away from Emmanuel TV.
    <br>In my house, we watch Emmanuel TV, 24 hours a day.
    <br>Whenever we watched, my daughter would always run away.
    <br>She would go down, play music and watch movies.
    <br>No matter what I would say to her, she would refuse to come and watch Emmanuel TV with us.
    <br>Before we brought her here, it was very tough for me.
    <br>I had been preparing since last year to bring her here -
    <br>I would postpone it; one thing or the other caused it not to be possible for me.
    <br>This very day, God really helped me and made everything possible for me.
    <br>I thank God. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you - you have listened to that.
    <br>My advice to viewers at home is that whatever situation you are in,
    <br>if it is similar to my own, please run to Jesus immediately so that God locates you and heal you...
    <br>Run to Jesus.
    <br>Run to Jesus immediately so that you can be free.
    <br>Thank you. Run to Jesus so that you can be free.
