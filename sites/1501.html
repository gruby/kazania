  <p>    
    <br>Man of God, I have been having an ear problem for the past 50 years.
    <br>The Prayer Line At The Paraguay Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>You are free! What is your name?
    <br>My name is Fernando.
    <br>Healed Of Deafness
    <br>No Longer Using Hearing Aids
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>I praise You, Lord!
    <br>For how long have you been using hearing aids?
    <br>I have been using it for 50 years.
    <br>And today, tell us what happened after the prophet prayed for you.
    <br>Now, I will not use it anymore.
    <br>I used it for 50 years.
    <br>When I was three years old, I took a drug which affected my ears.
    <br>I will not use it anymore. I am healed!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!

    <br>PASTORS' CONFERENCE
    <br>In Paraguay With T.B. Joshua
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Mr Luis Fernando Santacruz
    <br>Paraguay
    <br>My name is Luis Fernando Santacruz. I am 53 years old.
    <br>When I was three years old, I fell sick with hernia.
    <br>The doctors gave me medication that permanently damaged my ears.
    <br>There was no solution, not even surgery.

    <br>Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>The doctors prescribed hearing aids for me to use all the time.
    <br>However, sometimes I didn't use the hearing aids because I didn't want to look like I was disabled.
    <br>Over time, I learnt to read the lips of people to be able to understand what they were saying.
    <br>Testimony Time At The Paraguay
    <br>Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>A friend told me that Prophet T.B. Joshua was coming to Paraguay.
    <br>I decided to take a step of faith and go to the crusade
    <br>so that God would do the impossible and heal me.
    <br>Testimony Time At The Paraguay
    <br>Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I lost 75 percent of my hearing in the right ear and 64 percent in my left ear.

    <br>Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>This problem really affected me.
    <br>I used to hide this disability to the extent that only very close friends knew about it.
    <br>I was forced to lip-read; there was no other way for me to understand what others said.
    <br>If someone talked to me and I could not see his lips, I would not understand what he was saying.
    <br>Testimony Time At The Paraguay
    <br>Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When the prophet was coming close to me, I was focused on Jesus.
    <br>I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit as the prophet was almost in front of me and I said,
    <br>"God, this is the time!" Incredibly, I was healed!
    <br>Testimony Time At The Paraguay
    <br>Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When the prophet touched me, I was completely healed.
    <br>I could hardly believe that I went from being 70 percent deaf
    <br>to hearing conversations 5 metres away!

    <br>Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>When I went back home, I told my wife to do some tests;
    <br>she went to another room to talk to me and I was able to hear what she was saying!
    <br>The power of God is amazing!
    <br>Testimony Time At The Paraguay
    <br>Pastors' Conference With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>At church, for the first time in my life, I was able to hear the entire sermon effortlessly.

    <br>I am healed!
    <br>Everything is about faith; if you don't have faith, nothing can happen.
    <br>I thank God! I trusted in the Lord and here I am!
