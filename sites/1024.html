    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Millicent Kumah. I'm from Ghana.
    <br>Since about 15 years, I always ate in my dreams and whenever I woke up, I felt body pains,
    <br>especially in my waist, back and legs.
    <br>I felt pain all over my body.
    <br>I went to the hospital where I was given pain killers.
    <br>I took them, but still, I felt the pains all over my body.
    <br>So, one day I complained to a friend when I realised that this wasn't real
    <br>because the pain was too much, and despite taking pain killers, it was still the same. .
    <br>I said to myself that this was not just a sickness.
    <br>I told a friend of mine about my problem and she said, "Oh, my dear. Watch Emmanuel TV".
    <br>I said, "Ah, Emmanuel TV. What is that?"
    <br>She said, "Just watch and see".
    <br>From then, I began watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>And I realised, "Ah! I wish I had known about it long before that".
    <br>I began watching it day and night. I always have Emmanuel TV on.
    <br>Whenever Prophet T.B. Joshua is praying, I always pray along with him.
    <br>I then decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I came to The SCOAN last week.
    <br>When the man of God was praying during the mass prayer on Sunday,
    <br>"Wherever the sickness is located, be cast out! Be removed!",
    <br>I prayed along with him and put my hand where there was the pain, as he instructed.
    <br>I put my hand on my stomach and on my forehead.
    <br>All of a sudden, I felt an object in my mouth.
    <br>When I spat it out, blood started flowing out of my mouth.
    <br>When I saw the blood, I was surprised where this blood came from.
    <br>Then, I heard the man of God saying that I was given an object in the dream, which was the one coming out.
    <br>So, immediately the man of God started offering the mass prayer, you felt something coming out of you
    <br>which you vomited - that poisonous substance, just as the man of God had prophesied during the mass prayer
    <br>that there was somebody in the midst of the congregation vomiting poison.
    <br>Immediately, you were located right in the midst of the congregation,
    <br>as we are watching on the screen of our television, you were vomiting
    <br>that thick blood and poisonous substance as prophesied by the man of God.
    <br>Tell us what you felt in your system immediately you vomited that poisonous substance.
    <br>Immediately, the pain in my stomach, back, and my whole body (left).
    <br>I feel relieved. There is no more pain now.
    <br>The following day, I woke up feeling fresh, free, light.
    <br>No more pain. I thank God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Can you tell us some of the things you were not able to do
    <br>as a result of this agonising pain you suffered from all over your body for 15 years.
    <br>Because of the pain, I could not walk for a long distance; when I walked a little, I felt tired.
    <br>I had to rest.
    <br>Can you tell us, madam: What efforts did you put in place
    <br>or where did you go to in search for solution to get rid of this problem in these 15 years?
    <br>During that time, I went to the hospital and I was first told
    <br>that I had to undergo an operation to remove the moving object.
    <br>I refused.
    <br>But the pain continued so I went back to the hospital.
    <br>I was told the same thing that I should undergo the operation but I still refused.
    <br>I didn't want to undergo an operation.
    <br>But now, I can bend down, no pain.
    <br>I can bend sideways. No pain.
    <br>There is no more pain at my back or in my breasts.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me.
    <br>I am free, thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I am delivered, my family is delivered.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am free.
    <br>Once again, put your hands together for the miracle working God.
    <br>What is your advice to people listening to you all over the world concerning what God has done in your life?
    <br>My advice is that you should depend on God.
    <br>We have a God, the Creator of all things and the Fountain of all perfection.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am free.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty and we want to advise you, sister, that God Almighty has set you free
    <br>and rescued you from a terrible situation of many years.
    <br>We advise you to trust in the Lord. continue to follow Him along the way,
    <br>make His Word the standard for your life and better is not good enough, we know the best is yet to come.
    <br>Can you just exercise yourself before you finally go?
    <br>Bend your waist and tell us how you are feeling.
    <br>Any more pains?
    <br>No more pain. I feel free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!
