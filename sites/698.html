  <p>    
    <br>There is a woman there; as I am talking now,
    <br>she is ready to look for her former husband.
    <br>She has lost her husband for some months now.
    <br>Her spirit is saying, "I am going to call my husband,
    <br>I am going to look for my husband and say, 'Please, whatever happened, I am very sorry'".
    <br>She is there!
    <br>The woman wants to reconcile now.
    <br>I know your husband has offended you but you really want to reconcile.
    <br>She said, she wants to bring this man here to know God's opinion.
    <br>The woman is there.
    <br>You put a chain on your neck.
    <br>Come! She is there.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>Don't worry! Please, I want to meet her.
    <br>Let her wait for me.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>My name is Jane Udensi.
    <br>I came from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>The man of God said, there is a woman here,
    <br>and he pointed his hand in the direction where I was staying.
    <br>He said that there was a woman there - her husband left her for some months now,
    <br>and that she was ready to reconcile with her husband but there was no way.
    <br>He also mentioned that the woman put a necklace on her neck.
    <br>I confirm it to be true.
    <br>How can you confirm this prophecy to be true?
    <br>I confirm it to be true because for some months now, my husband left me.
    <br>We had been quarrelling and fighting and he left me
    <br>because of the fruit of the womb; we had had no children since we married.
    <br>It affected my marriage because there was no peace;
    <br>we fought and quarrelled all the time.
    <br>He sent me packing and married another woman
    <br>and asked me to go for another man.
    <br>There was no peace, no joy, no affection.
    <br>In the last two months, he threw my things outside and seized the others.
    <br>I didn't do anything; he beat me and threw my things outside.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>And now that you have received this prophecy,
    <br>God Almighty has brought breakthrough, reconciliation and also healing in your life.
    <br>Yes, I believe, because since the man of God called me out,
    <br>I know that my problem is over.
    <br>Amen, we thank Jesus Christ for the wonderful prophecy you have received today.
    <br>Today is your divine appointment with Jesus Christ
    <br>and we believe that your way has been opened.
    <br>We want to encourage you to make God's Word the standard for your life,
    <br>so that you can maintain the wonderful healing that you are about to receive
    <br>and the reconciliation, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Jane Udensi. I came from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God prophesied that there was a woman there
    <br>who had left her husband for more than two months now.
    <br>The woman was wearing a necklace and wanted to reconcile with her husband but he refused.
    <br>Then I came out.
    <br>He sent me away because since we got married,
    <br>we have not had children and there was no affection.
    <br>He also said I had a spiritual husband that had been tormenting him in his dreams.
    <br>He said that I was an ogbanje (witch) and was causing him to be sick.
    <br>I think reasonably, we should hear from our brother.
    <br>My name is Ogochukwu Udensi. I am from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>It's true that I sent my wife away because since we married, there was no child.
    <br>There was no affection because my wife had a spiritual husband
    <br>that had been tormenting me in my dreams.
    <br>He would carry a gun or knife and pursue me.
    <br>He came physically?
    <br>No. In dreams, Man of God.
    <br>How? Tell us how he came in the dream!
    <br>He would carry a gun. Sometimes, he would carry a knife and I would run.
    <br>The spiritual husband resembled my wife, and pursued me with a gun.
    <br>How did you know that it was your wife that turned into a spiritual husband?
    <br>Because I could see her face.
    <br>That is why you pursued her out?
    <br>Yes. It is true, Man of God.
    <br>He said the reason why he pursued the woman out, the marriage collapsed
    <br>because he used to see this woman in the dream coming to attack him with a gun, weapon,
    <br>and he always found himself running.
    <br>In real life, did your wife use to pursue you?
    <br>No.
    <br>Your wife cannot stand you in the physical. Then, why are you running in the dream?
    <br>And you know it is your wife. Why can't you wait for her?
    <br>Because she wanted to kill me.
    <br>That is why I ran.
    <br>Both of them need deliverance.
    <br>And after the deliverance, he will know that he is more of an enemy than friend to his wife.
    <br>And the wife too is more of an enemy than friend.
    <br>Do you listen to me?
    <br>I will repeat again.
    <br>You are more of an enemy than a friend to your wife.
    <br>Your wife is more of an enemy than friend to you.
    <br>So who is a witch, who is a wizard now?
    <br>If the wife is a witch, he himself is a wizard.
    <br>Please tell him: If truly the wife is a witch, he himself is a wizard.
    <br>That is all. The two of them need deliverance.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>They are husband and wife. This is a marriage from God.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
