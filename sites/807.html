    <br>On April 16, 2016 A Devastating 7.8 Earthquake Struck The Nation Of Ecuador
    <br>The Devastation Of The School In The Indigenous Community Of San Salvador De Los Chachis
    <br>One major casualty of the earthquake was the bilingual educational complex
    <br>in the Chachi indigenous community of San Salvador located deep within the Mache-Chindul rainforest
    <br>This was the main primary and secondary school for the community and its areas,
    <br>providing education for more than 300 students.
    <br>The community was shattered by its loss.
    <br>Since the destruction of the school threatened not only the education of the children,
    <br>but also the very future of the community itself.
    <br>The Devastation Of The School In The Indigenous Community Of San Salvador De Los Chachis
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Chartered A Cargo Plane With 20 Tonnes Of Relief Aid For Ecuador
    <br>The essential food and hygiene items had been bought in Columbia by T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>specifically to meet the needs of the earthquake victims.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Prepare The Relief Aid And Load The Cargo Plane
    <br>The Cargo Plane Takes Off From Bogota, Colombia And Lands in Quito, Ecuador
    <br>The cargo plane was received in Quito, Equador, and then two large trucks provided by the Armed Forces
    <br>transported the goods to the Emmanuel TV Operations Centre in the Esmeraldas Province,
    <br>close to the areas most affected by the earthquake.
    <br>The Aid Is Unloaded And Transported By The Ecuador Military To The Relief Camps
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team With Local Volunteers Prepare The Relief Aid Packages For Distribution
    <br>The team worked with local volunteers to pack and then to personally distribute
    <br>the much needed supplies, together with fresh fruits and vegetables,
    <br>to official Government Shelter Camps in various communities.

    <br>During this programme, the Governor of Esmeraldas, Paola Cabezas,
    <br>told the Emmanuel TV team about the Chachi Community of San Salvador,
    <br>who had received very little help due to their remote location within the rainforest.

    <br>The Emmanuel TV team immediately made plans to go there,
    <br>taking with them over 2 tonnes of the essential relief aid
    <br>as well as emergency water purification kits for each family.

    <br>The San Salvador community was indeed difficult to reach,
    <br>with all the relief items having to be transported by canoe.

    <br>Many of the Emmanuel TV team with local helpers, also had to walk for around two hours to reach San Salvador.
    <br>In many places the trail was very muddy.

    <br>On arrival, the local community helped unload the canoes
    <br>and prepare for the distribution of the family hygiene boxes and the food.

    <br>The community all gathered together to receive the family hygiene boxes and the food aid,
    <br>encouraged and happy to know that they had not been forgotten.
    <br>During their visit, the Emmanuel TV Team saw that the children were no longer able to go to school
    <br>and arranged some games and activities for them.

    <br>Later some students, parents and teachers from the school explained more.
    <br>Jose Gabriel Tapuya de la Cruz - Student from 'Juan Lorenzo Anapa' School
    <br>I am in the 9th grade and I am 19 years old.
    <br>The school collapsed due to the earthquake on the 16th of April, 2016
    <br>As students, we were not able to continue studying because it was very dangerous.
    <br>Luis San Nicolas - Teacher from 'Juan Lorenzo Anapa' School
    <br>Currently, I am working in this school as a teacher of History and Geography.
    <br>We never expected such a natural disaster but unfortunately, everything has been destroyed.
    <br>So, as teachers, we have built temporary classrooms to be able to continue teaching.
    <br>We did this because the Ministry of Education made a law that the teaching should continue.
    <br>Karely Chasim - 16 years old / 11th Grade
    <br>I want to be a lawyer.
    <br>To come to school, we have to walk about one hour and a half.
    <br>Sometimes, when it rains, it is more difficult because of the mud.
    <br>Arriving in a school that is not in proper conditions to study is also very disappointing.
    <br>Moreover, we are worried about our uniforms getting wet or dirty.
    <br>My name is Adriana Andreína de la Cruz. I live in this community, San Salvador de Los Chachis.
    <br>I have three children - two boys and one girl.
    <br>One of them is in year 2 and the other one in year 1 of primary school.
    <br>When the earthquake happened, the classrooms collapsed and the walls fell down;
    <br>now our children don't have anywhere to study. These are not proper conditions for them to study.
    <br>When it rains, the temporary classrooms get flooded and the children are not fine there.
    <br>As a mother, I am very concerned because I want my children to study in a proper school.
    <br>Agustín Anapa Tapuyo - Director of 'Juan Lorenzo Anapa' School
    <br>This institution has about 310 students.
    <br>Right now, we are in crisis due to the earthquake which has severely damaged the school building.
    <br>This school is very important because everything depends on education.
    <br>Both children and the youth can make it in life with education.
    <br>Education forms them every day; as their character is formed, they serve their nation.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Invite An Architect To Survey The Damage Done To The School
    <br>Moved by this tragedy, Emmanuel TV quickly arranged for a top Equadorian architect
    <br>to visit the site, where he observed the damage and the poor quality of construction.

    <br>Following the visit, the architect and his team drew up comprehensive plans
    <br>for a much improved replacement school.

    <br>For the community leaders, this was a dream come true.
    <br>They expressed their thanks and commitment to help the project succeed.
    <br>The project is for a school of approximately 300 children, distributed as follows:
    <br>50 children in kindergarten, 200 in primary school and 50 in secondary school.
    <br>To fulfill these needs, we are proposing building 14 classrooms:
    <br>2 for kindergarten, 10 for primary and 2 for secondary education.
    <br>Moreover, we propose a computer room and science laboratories for Physics and Chemistry.
    <br>We are also planning to build a library, administrative office and staff room for teachers.
    <br>T.B. Joshua joined with the Emmanuel TV Partners and wasted no time
    <br>in agreeing to pay for this major construction project.
    <br>On hearing of the Emmanuel TV plan to rebuild the school,
    <br>one of the men from the village also spoke on behalf of the community.
    <br>Santiago De La Cruz Anapa - Representative Of The Chachi Community
    <br>I am joined by the Governor, School Director and other elders of The Chachi Community
    <br>The entire community is very happy to see that a dream is about to become reality.
    <br>This dream of having in the community an educational institution in line with
    <br>the development of the modernisation of education and society in the world today.
    <br>To guarantee the execution of this proposal, the entire community through an assembly
    <br>resolved to undertake this serious commitment to collaborate with the Emmanuel TV Team
    <br>with the transportation of materials in canoes, on donkeys and horses and with the labour
    <br>necessary for the project according to our possibilities.
    <br>We are sure that thanks to you, T.B. Joshua,
    <br>our children, grandchildren, brethren and the coming generations will receive
    <br>education in suitable classrooms, with space for research
    <br>to strengthen the educational process.
    <br>The community of San Salvador De Los Chachis
    <br>is located in the heart of the ecological reserve Mache-Chindul.
    <br>However, this doesn't signify that we don't have the right to receive quality education
    <br>in the infrastructure like the one you (T.B. Joshua) will provide for us.
    <br>For the first time in our history, this project is something that has fallen from Heaven to earth.
    <br>All our community members are going to work in this project.
    <br>Don't expect that only the architect and the Emmanuel TV Team will do the work.
    <br>The Chachi community is also going to collaborate with
    <br>both the transportation of the materials and coming together to build all the classrooms.
    <br>T.B. Joshua, thank you very much!
    <br>For us, it is so exciting to have a new school building
    <br>because before, we didn't have a school of such quality,
    <br>and if Emmanuel TV is giving us the opportunity to have it, we are ready to receive it.
    <br>Thank you very much to the organisation, Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I am very grateful and thank Emmanuel TV because you are doing us a great favour.
    <br>This year, I finished my secondary education, and I want my children to finish as well,
    <br>so they can make it in life and I will continue motivating them.
    <br>With this new school, we will not have headaches due to the heat; if it rains, we will not get wet
    <br>so we will be able to learn better. Thank you, Emmanuel TV!
    <br>I appreciate you so much with all my heart. Thank you for what you are doing.
    <br>I am very happy and joyful to receive this great gift from you.
    <br>The Community Of San Salvador De Los Chachis In The Mache Chindul Ecological Reserve
    <br>Although the land for the school belongs to the Chachi community,
    <br>the school itself is a government school
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV team had important discussions with politicians and officials
    <br>before the construction work began.

    <br>Jorge Glas - Vice President of the Republic of Ecuador - discusses the School Construction Project with the Emmanuel TV Team and officials of the Ministry of Education.
    <br>My name is Carlos Bernal.
    <br>I am the Secretary of the Reconstruction Committee of the Republic of Ecuador
    <br>after the earthquake of the 16th of April.
    <br>I would like to thank you for your cooperation.
    <br>We really need your help and we appreciate it.
    <br>We are coordinating all through the official channels of the government.
    <br>We greatly appreciate your contribution to the school
    <br>because we are very concious of the needs of this commuinity.

    <br>The local Chachi community starts by demolishing most of the severely damaged school buildings,
    <br>preparing the way for the construction work to begin.

    <br>Later on in the process, the final two of the old school classrooms are also demolished.

    <br>Education is the means of empowering people to take control of their own lives,
    <br>as learning how to learn is one of life's most important skills.
    <br>Education is to give us success.
    <br>It is a rare privilege to send someone to school; to contribute to someone's future.
    <br>And Emmanuel TV has the privilege of contributing to the future of generations from the Chachi community
    <br>and other farming settlements along the river.
    <br>Today, the first materials will be going up the river, ready to start the construction.
    <br>Marcelo San Nicolas De La Cruz - President of Parents Association Of The School
    <br>These are all the materials that will be transported to San Salvador by canoe.
    <br>This is the gasoline for the boats and this is the food for the workers.
    <br>This is the sand in bags and these are the rocks that we are carrying to San Salvador.
    <br>I give thanks to Emmanuel TV for supporting our community
    <br>and for giving us this opportunity that we never had before. Thank you very much!
    <br>The Building Materials Are Loaded Into The Canoes For The School Sponsored By T.B. Joshua
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Take the Materials By Canoe To San Salvador De Los Chachis
    <br>It soon became clear that the large amounts of material needed to be transported more quickly
    <br>for the start of the construction and so a huge truck delivered stones to be transferred to smaller trucks,
    <br>which were trying to cross the river to get closer to San Salvador.
    <br>Unloading The Stones For Construction Which Will Be Transported To The Community
    <br>The Construction Materials Are Transported By Truck To The Community Over Rough Terrain
    <br>The river crossing proved to be a challenge but with extra muscle power being provided
    <br>by the local community, the truck finally made it.

    <br>Other sections of the track were improved by laying stones to help the truck's tyres grip.
    <br>The Construction Materials Are Transported By Truck To The Community Over Rough Terrain
    <br>Then there was a major breakthrough: Because of the commitment of Emmanuel TV to the school project,
    <br>the government provided heavy machinery to clear the track all the way to San Salvador.
    <br>This meant that on the few days that were dry enough,
    <br>the vehicles carrying the materials for the school construction could drive all the way.
