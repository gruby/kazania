  <p>    
    <br>I deliver you from any satanic covenant -
    <br>covenant of attitude, covenant of character - be delivered!
    <br>Be delivered!
    <br>Deliver and release yourself!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to release yourself from any satanic covenant -
    <br>covenant of attitude, covenant of character, and covenant of behaviour.
    <br>Begin to release yourself!
    <br>Get yourself out of this covenant!
    <br>You are released!
    <br>Be released!
    <br>As the fire of the Holy Spirit descended on the people following the prayer of release from Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the evil spirit that had destroyed this young woman is exposed and begins to manifest.
    <br>She's a prostitute.
    <br>Spirit of anger.
    <br>The spirit that pushed her to prostitution and criss-crossed her body with tattoos
    <br>is now being consumed by the fire of God as she is about to be set free.
    <br>You are released!
    <br>Be released! In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ayisha Idirisu.
    <br>I'm from Mali, but we are based in Ghana.
    <br>And the woman standing beside you, who is she to you?
    <br>She's my mother.
    <br>I want to thank the man of God for delivering me last Sunday from the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>I'm a professional prostitution.
    <br>You mean you're a professional prostitute.
    <br>Yes, an international prostitute.
    <br>Professional prostitute, what do you mean by that?
    <br>I put my pictures on Facebook and Instagram so that I'll be communicating with men.
    <br>I will be communicating with them to have an affair with them so that they will pay me.
    <br>It all started when I was 9 to 10 years old.
    <br>On my way to school, I met an old man.
    <br>He tricked me and gave me money to sleep with me in an unfinished building.
    <br>That is when I started having that spirit of prostitution - since that age.
    <br>I would be running after men, but not ugly men. That spirit didn''t like ugly men.
    <br>Only handsome men. If he was handsome and I liked him, no matter who he was,
    <br>if I looked at him, I had to have him.
    <br>So that is how it started.
    <br>So you mean at the age of 10 years, you started meeting men?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And how many men did you meet every day?
    <br>Sometimes two, three or four.
    <br>Does that mean while you were doing all this, your parents - your mother and father -
    <br>they were not there to see you?
    <br>My father divorced my mom when I was very young.
    <br>So I was the one taking care of my mom, my sisters and brothers.
    <br>At that age I started being with men, going to clubs with friends,
    <br>smoking weed and cigarettes, drinking alcohol.
    <br>Sometimes I would be with my friends -
    <br>maybe we were three or four - and one man would just tell us, "I want all of you".
    <br>We would go to the man's place.
    <br>Then the man would tell us that we must be together as lesbians before he would have an affair with us.
    <br>We would be together as lesbians before he would have an affair with us.
    <br>Then he would pay us and we would go back home.
    <br>So how many of you would be together that the man would be sleeping with? How many of you?
    <br>Sometimes, we were three or four and sometimes two.
    <br>Sometimes two girls, sometimes three girls, sometimes four girls.
    <br>That was how I started doing it.
    <br>I was a prostitute when I met my baby's daddy.
    <br>At what age now?
    <br>When I met my baby's daddy, I was 15 years old.
    <br>The guy tried to change me but he couldn´t change me.
    <br>I got pregnant for him and I give birth in 2012.
    <br>My mom told the guy's family that he had to marry me.
    <br>So they came and paid my bride price.
    <br>One day, I was at my mom's place and somebody called me that the guy brought her and my friend
    <br>inside his house so I went straight to their house and fought with the girl.
    <br>The guy's mother called me and told me that her son will not marry me again
    <br>so I should just go away.
    <br>That was how I left and rented my own apartment.
    <br>I just told myself that if I didn't get married again, I should go back to my work of prostitution
    <br>because that would make me survive and take good care of my family.
    <br>So I just went back and rented an apartment.
    <br>I called guys, sometimes two guys.
    <br>I would be having an affair with two guys, three guys, four guys in the same night.
    <br>So that was how I continued to do it.
    <br>I was still forcing myself to change but no solution.
    <br>Because if I stopped, my family would not eat; my family would not do anything.
    <br>I went to a native doctor to tell the native doctor,
    <br>"This work I'm doing - I'm a prostitute -  I want to stop it but I need quick money.
    <br>I need blood money so that I can take care of my family".
    <br>The native doctor said, "Ok" and told me to bring 8000 Ghana cedis.
    <br>I went and borrowed the money.
    <br>The native doctor told me that around 10 o'clock, we would be going somewhere.
    <br>I didn't know that place.
    <br>At 10 o'clock, I went up to the native doctor's place and he took me to a cemetery.
    <br>He told me that I would bathe three times a day.
    <br>That was Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.
    <br>I said, "Okay, if that will make me get the quick money, no problem. I will do it".
    <br>I followed the native doctor in doing it but no solution.
    <br>I went to pastors.
    <br>Not one pastor, not two pastors. Some of them would take my money,
    <br>some of them would be sleeping with me.
    <br>But no solution. I accepted that I had to stop this prostitution.
    <br>It was not for me. But if I stopped, my family would not eat.
    <br>So I needed quick money.
    <br>You needed quick money.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok. So why did you now go to all these pastors? What were you looking for?
    <br>Ghanaian pastors will tell you that they will give you lotto numbers, plenty of things.
    <br>So you also went to them for help?
    <br>Yes, for help.
    <br>And what happened after that?
    <br>At long last, they would just sleep with me and tell me that I would get the money.
    <br>But I would not get it.
    <br>I would sleep and dream that I was swimming inside water.
    <br>When I then woke up in the morning and saw a handsome guy going
    <br>or sitting there, I would just go straight to that guy and look at him, just like that.
    <br>How did you look at them?
    <br>I would just look at him.
    <br>Just like that. I would just look at him.
    <br>So that he would fall for me and have an affair with me.
    <br>But for him to date me - no way.
    <br>He would just promise me, "I will date you; I will marry you".
    <br>So this was how you would get men?
    <br>Yes, that's how I would get men.
    <br>I didn't go for ugly men because that spirit in me didn't like ugly men.
    <br>I would only be with handsome men because when I got them and slept with them,
    <br>I would just take my money and go my way.
    <br>I didn't know what would happen to them.
    <br>Okay, you said while you were looking for quick money, you went to do some rituals.
    <br>Explain to us again: You said you were taken to a graveyard.
    <br>Yes, the native doctor took me to a graveyard and I had to get naked.
    <br>There was a certain water opposite, just behind the grave.
    <br>He told me to get naked, go inside, swim and take anything I want.
    <br>I did it three times.
    <br>He gave me an egg to put inside the water and old currency coins.
    <br>I threw them inside the water and went back but there was no solution.
    <br>I didn't go there again.
    <br>I have one friend in Nigeria - a guy.
    <br>I met him on social media - Facebook.
    <br>I told him that I needed blood money because I had to take care of my family.
    <br>He asked me, "You don't have a father?"
    <br>I said, "I have a father but he doesn't take care of us
    <br>and my mother doesn't work, so I'm the one taking care of my family".
    <br>So he said, "Okay, I will introduce you to an occultist".
    <br>He introduced me to the occultist.
    <br>He told me to bring a certain amount of money.
    <br>But I couldn't get the money and that was why I didn't go and join the cult.
    <br>After that, I just decided to travel outside the country
    <br>so that I would stop that prostitution and get money.
    <br>I called one agent and the agent told me that he could help me to travel
    <br>- to Saudi Arabia first. I said, "Okay".
    <br>I put my apartment up for rent, sold everything I had.
    <br>I even borrowed money and gave it to the agent.
    <br>That is the visa so that I could travel to Saudi Arabia. That was March last year.
    <br>He did everything and told me that I was going to work in a company.
    <br>I told him, "Okay".  When I arrived in Saudi Arabia, they took me to a certain house.
    <br>The boss inside the house told me that I should bring my passport.
    <br>I asked, "Why? I did my part. I got this passport with my money".
    <br>He told me, "I bought you. You are my slave now".
    <br>I said, "I paid a lot of money before I got here".
    <br>He said, "No, I bought you. I paid the agent 250 million Ghanaian cedis".
    <br>I then called the agent.
    <br>So you were sold for 250 million Ghanaian cedis?
    <br>Yes
    <br>To that man?
    <br>To that man.
    <br>I then called the agent but the agent didn´t pick the call.
    <br>I called my mom to tell her.
    <br>She said that I should just manage it.
    <br>So I said, "Ok, no problem".
    <br>So you were sold to this man to be doing what?
    <br>To serve him and his family for good two years as a housemaid.
    <br>before they released me to return to my country.
    <br>When I was inside the house, they were treating me very bad.
    <br>Sometimes, I would eat once in three days.
    <br>And that was not a real meal - maybe a banana or an orange and then just go to sleep.
    <br>They would be beating me up; they would do very bad things to me.
    <br>I couldn't sleep. I would sleep maybe at around 3 am in the morning,
    <br>wake up at 4 am in the morning and start working.
    <br>The house was a three-storey building and I would clean the house.
    <br>Every day, I had to clean the house with my hands.
    <br>I then made up my mind that I had to survive in this house. If not, I would just die.
    <br>My family didn´t even know where I was.
    <br>When I was working, they didn't even pay me money.
    <br>And it was because of money that I went to Saudi Arabia.
    <br>I said to myself that I had to get this man - the woman´s husband. If I did something...
    <br>You mean your boss?
    <br>Yes, my boss.
    <br>If I did something with him, I would be okay.
    <br>I would be a little bit okay in that house.
    <br>They would not treat me the way they were treating me before.
    <br>One day when the madam and the children went out, my boss said I should bring him a coffee.
    <br>After I had done the coffee and brought it into his room, I was face-to-face with the man.
    <br>When the man just looked at my eyes, he started having an affair with me.
    <br>That was how it started. That was the same way I got the man´s son too.
    <br>I was having an affair with the man and with the man´s son inside the house.
    <br>But they didn't know.
    <br>So you used the power in your eyes?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I would just look face-to-face at them.
    <br>When I looked face-to-face at them, I would not shine my eyes or do anything.
    <br>I would just look at you and you had to have an affair with me.
    <br>The way they were treating me before reduced.
    <br>If the woman was beating me or not giving me money to eat,
    <br>the man and his son would just disgrace the woman and insult her.
    <br>But both of them didn't know that I was doing something with each of them.
    <br>That was how it was going on inside the house.
    <br>I said, "No, I didn't come here for that prostitution.
    <br>I came here to work with my hands. So why am I doing this? I must get out of the house".
    <br>I called one of my friends. She is in Dubai.
    <br>I told her about that. My friend said, "These Arab people - that is how they are.
    <br>So if you didn't do something bad to them, you could never survive in their house.
    <br>They will even kill you. So maybe you should take something and run away to the police station".
    <br>So I took one of his son's phones.
    <br>Your friend advised you that if you wanted to leave the house, you must do something wrong.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So what did she advise you to do?
    <br>I took one of his daughter's phones and when they were sleeping,
    <br>I just jumped over the wall - it was not a small wall.
    <br>I jumped over the wall and went outside.
    <br>The police were everywhere.
    <br>When I went outside, I did not have papers. They asked and I said I didn't have them.
    <br>The police took me to the police station and asked me why I had run away.
    <br>I told them how they were treating me inside the house and they called my boss.
    <br>My boss said, "Ayisha has told me. I don't like Ayisha again".
    <br>I spent six days in the police station.
    <br>My boss came with a certain man...
    <br>Can you explain to us - why did you steal something from them?
    <br>So that my boss would say, "I don't like this girl again; I don´t want to work with this girl".
    <br>So you did that so that they would send you out of the house.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I was in the police station - one day, I saw my boss with a certain man.
    <br>They came and they were just talking.
    <br>He just said, "This is the girl I bought and I want to sell her to you".
    <br>I didn't say anything and my boss said, "This is your boss.
    <br>This is the money he has given me so this is your new boss who you will work for".
    <br>I said:  "Okay, no problem".
    <br>So you were sold to another man.
    <br>Another man.
    <br>I said:  "Ok, no problem" because I didn't have a choice.
    <br>If I didn't agree, I would just be in the prison, nowhere to go.
    <br>They would even kill me because they didn't know my family.
    <br>So I said, "Okay, no problem".
    <br>I followed the man to his house.
    <br>That house was even more horrible than the first house.
    <br>They were treating me very bad.
    <br>I couldn't sleep. I couldn´t do anything inside the house.
    <br>I would work for the woman and the woman would take me to her family and I would work at that house.
    <br>I would go to another house to work so that they would pay the woman.
    <br>And I would go to another house to work.
    <br>They would give the woman money.  So I was just working house to house.
    <br>So that was what I was doing at the second house.
    <br>I said to myself, "These people will kill me.
    <br>I will never go back to my country so I must do something
    <br>because it is for the sake of my family that I came here.
    <br>I came up with the same plan as in the first house.
    <br>I said to myself, "I must have this woman's husband. If I have this woman's husband,
    <br>I think my problem will be solved a little bit".
    <br>One day the woman was sleeping and her husband was inside the parlour.
    <br>I just got naked and went straight to the husband and the husband had a...
    <br>You went naked?
    <br>Yes, I went straight to the husband and he had an affair with me.
    <br>In the morning, the husband called his wife and told her
    <br>that the way they were treating me inside the house was not good. They should be careful.
    <br>Now tell us what happened?  How did you manage to return to Ghana?
    <br>I ran away and the police saw me.
    <br>They told me,"This girl has been brought to the police station every day.
    <br>We are tired with this girl. She must go to jail".
    <br>That was how they put me into jail.
    <br>I spent like three and a half months inside there.
    <br>When I was inside the jail, I saw many Africans -
    <br>Nigerians, Ugandans, Kenyans and Ghanaians.
    <br>As I'm a Muslim, I don't pray.
    <br>When I was at my first boss' place, I used to watch Emmanuel TV on YouTube.
    <br>When I went to prison, I saw that when the girls were praying,
    <br>they would mention the name of the man of God - "God of T.B. Joshua, help us!"
    <br>Then I said, "Although I am a Muslim, I must join in these prayers.
    <br>Maybe God will set me free and I can go back to my country".
    <br>I joined them; we all prayed.
    <br>We always prayed - in the morning and at night.
    <br>So one day I was just sitting there.
    <br>I didn't even know I would be free because it was not yet my time.
    <br>I had to spend maybe two years or one and a half years before they would bring me back to Ghana.
    <br>But I spent just three and a half months.
    <br>They just told me, "Ayisha, your visa is ready to go back to Ghana".
    <br>That was how I came back Ghana.
    <br>Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So you were joining a group of people while they were praying together,
    <br>watching Emmanuel TV, asking God to rescue them.
    <br>If God can rescue them, they will give their life to Christ.
    <br>So you joined this group of people and one day you were called that you needed to go back to your country.
    <br>Yes, they released me and people were still inside the prison but they just released me without any reason.
    <br>When I went to Ghana, I had made up my mind that I would come to The SCOAN for deliverance
    <br>because I knew that I needed deliverance.
    <br>I called one of my girlfriends because I didn´t have anywhere to stay.
    <br>I called her and my friend said I should come.
    <br>When I got to the house, I told my friend, "I need to go to The Synagogue".
    <br>My friend asked me, "To do what?" I said,  "Deliverance".
    <br>And my friend just told me, "Can deliverance give you money?
    <br>Why don't you start your prostitution again?"
    <br>I said, "Okay, it's true. Even if I get deliverance, who will feed me? Who will feed my family?"
    <br>So I should just continue my prostitution.
    <br>That was how I continued doing prostitution when I came back to Ghana.
    <br>One day, I dreamt. I saw a woman.
    <br>She was like a goddess. I saw her in my dream.
    <br>When I woke up in the morning on that fateful day, one of my girlfriends showed me something on her phone,
    <br>"I saw a tatoo on the internet yesterday night. It was very very nice". I said, "Let me see the tattoo".
    <br>When she showed me the tattoo, it was the same tattoo I had dreamt about and I went to have it done.
    <br>So you dreamt you saw this image in your dream and the following day you went to have this tattoo?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So what was the reason for this? And what do you actually do with this tattoo?
    <br>This tattoo I have - whenever I go out, I must expose my body.
    <br>So that when people see me, they would just have feelings for me.
    <br>So you were having this and each time you went out to look for men, you had to...
    <br>Can you tell us - how did you normally dress? We can see some pictures here on the board.
    <br>And when you dressed like that, what were you actually looking for?
    <br>Okay, this dress was like - maybe when I was going out in the morning to the beachside or hotel.
    <br>That was how I dressed so that I would attract men.
    <br>This would also be in the morning because in the evening I didn´t even dress like this
    <br>- this was even long.
    <br>In the evening I didn´t dress like this at all -  that was at the beachside.
    <br>I had to dress like this so that I would be attracting men.
    <br>Maybe four or three men in a day - I would be having an affair with them.
    <br>When you came back from the journey you went to, you continued your prostitution.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Okay. Can you continue?
    <br>Three weeks ago, I was just sitting inside my room by myself.
    <br>It was evening time.
    <br>My friends - we were four inside the room - were going out to a club. It was a Friday.
    <br>They told me, "Let´s go".  I said, "No, I don't feel like going out today. You should go".
    <br>They said, "You don't have money anymore.
    <br>Your mom is even sick and you must send money to your mom".
    <br>I said, "I don't feel like going out so you people should go".
    <br>Since I came back, I never prayed.
    <br>I had even forgotten that I had prayed and that God had set me free from the prison.
    <br>Since I had come back, I had forgotten to pray.
    <br>I was just sitting there on that fateful day.
    <br>I said, "Today I must pray because this work is not for me. I don´t want to do this work again".
    <br>So I just prayed, "God of T.B. Joshua, please save me. You are the Father of the poor.
    <br>Help me and change me in this situation".
    <br>And I slept. I saw the man of God in my dream.
    <br>He told me, "Without deliverance, you have nowhere to go".
    <br>And you have never met with the Man of God before?.
    <br>No, no, no,
    <br>You have never been here?
    <br>I have never met him before.
    <br>So I replied to  him, "Can deliverance give  me money?" because...
    <br>Yes, inside my dream and the man of God just told me straight, "With God all things are possible".
    <br>That was when I woke up from my dream.
    <br>I then said to myself, "I need to go to The  Synagogue, no matter what".
    <br>But that day - it was like I hadn't eaten for two days.
    <br>I was taking only water; I didn´t even have a penny on me.
    <br>I was using an iPhone 6 and if you sell it, it costs quite a bit.
    <br>I said to myself, "Ok, let me sell my phone and come down here".
    <br>So that was how I sold my phone and came here last week Sunday.
    <br>Now tell us: How did you receive your deliverance during the mass prayer when you came last Sunday?
    <br>Yes, I was sitting there.
    <br>When the mass prayer started, it was like hell. All over my body was fire.
    <br>Something just told me to go straight and grab the man of God's leg.
    <br>But I was just standing there.
    <br>I said, "I must go to him and grab this man´s leg because he was disturbing me with the prayer".
    <br>I just took one step, and I didn't see anything again.
    <br>MIss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>So during the mass prayer, while the prayer was going on,
    <br>that evil spirit inside of you was pushing you to go forward to the man of God to grab his leg.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When you made an attempt to do that, what did you say happened to you?
    <br>I didn't see anything again.
    <br>I just saw myself that I was sitting here.
    <br>So you mean you got your deliverance last Sunday?
    <br>Yes, I got my deliverance. I didn't  even feel like smoking or taking alcohol.
    <br>So before, you used to smoke and drink.  Can you tell us what kind of cigarettes you took in the past.
    <br>I smoked weed and cigarettes, and I drank a lot of alcohol.
    <br>But since that day...
    <br>Since your deliverance.
    <br>No, I haven´t even attempted to do that or feel something for men and all that.
    <br>Since last Sunday.
    <br>Yes, since last Sunday.
    <br>You don´t feel for men. What do you mean by you don´t feel for men?
    <br>If it was like before, I would just feel something like, "Go out and get men".
    <br>But since my deliverance, that thing is not talking to me anymore.
    <br>I don´t have bad dreams anymore. I used to fly inside my dream a lot.
    <br>Every day I was inside the water swimming but since my deliverance - no more.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ!
    <br>The great Deliverer who has delivered our sister from the spirits of prostitution and marine spirit
    <br>that had possessed her for a very long time.
    <br>And she has explained to us how she has indeed used this power to destroy men and those around her.
    <br>Is your mom aware of this job you were doing?
    <br>Because you said that you were actually bringing money home.
    <br>No, my mom is not aware because she doesn't have a choice.
    <br>She doesn't have money, she doesn't have a helper.
    <br>So when I brought her money, she wouldn´t ask me anything.
    <br>So each time you come back home with money that you got from prostitution,
    <br>she didn´t even bother to ask you?
    <br>No.
    <br>Does this mean that you have never gone to school? You didn´t go to any college? Or study?
    <br>No, no. I just stopped school when I was in JSS 2.
    <br>You stopped schooling when you were in JSS 2. Why did you stop?
    <br>Because I didn't have money. I didn´t even have that money to go to school.
    <br>And my mom didn´t have.
    <br>So that's why I said, "I must stop and do that prostitution. It will help me".
    <br>And now to the glory of God, today you are delivered.
    <br>You are set free completely from this spirit that had been tormenting you for a very long time.
    <br>Before we listen to your mom, what word of advice do you have for young ones
    <br>who are watching you right now? Because in the first place you left Ghana
    <br>because you were looking for quick money.
    <br>And when you got to Saudi Arabia, your situation grew worse.
    <br>Can you tell us: What advice do you want to give to young ones who are watching you
    <br>and listening to you right now?
    <br>Ok, my advice is especially to young girls.
    <br>They should not rush in life.
    <br>No matter who you are, no matter how poor you are, just be patient
    <br>and wait for God's time because God's time is the best.
    <br>Those women - if their daughters bring them money and they don´t ask where they got the money from,
    <br>they should be very careful and ask their daughters where they got the money from.
    <br>Because that is how we girls do it and have money to give to our parents.
    <br>So those women should be very careful and advise their children.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus.
    <br>We believe that this word of advice you are giving to young ones all over the world
    <br>is a typical example that they must be content in life.
    <br>That whatever situation you find yourself in, God's time is the best.
    <br>When it's God's time for you to achieve something, your tension and pressure will never be required.
    <br>We thank God today that God Almighty has indeed brought you out of the darkness
    <br>to this marvellous light.
    <br>Now you can stand to testify to the goodness of God
    <br>that the only solution to this problem is to have Jesus Christ.
    <br>Accept Him with all your heart and when you have Him, you have everything.
    <br>We thank God for your life.
    <br>Let's quickly listen to your mother, who we believe has one or two things to say.
    <br>Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Origninally I'm from Niger but I live in Ghana.
    <br>Okay, Mamma. Can you tell us: what do you know about your daughter?
    <br>I believe you've listened to one or two things that she has just said.
    <br>Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>My daughter at the age between 9 and 10,  became very stubborn.
    <br>Anything I told her, she didn't listen to it.
    <br>Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>When she was between 9 and 10, I divorced the father.
    <br>She was supposed to be in JSS 2 but she stopped schooling.
    <br>So the mother then asked the daughter, "Why have you stopped schooling?"
    <br>The daughter said, "Because you don't have money to sponsor me in my education anymore,
    <br>I want to go and live my life somewhere else".
    <br>Were you aware that your daughter was doing prostitution?
    <br>Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>In the beginning, I didn't know what job she was doing. It was later that I found out.
    <br>Since she received her deliverance, what changes have you seen in her?
    <br>Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Since her deliverance last Sunday, everything about the daughter has changed.
    <br>She doesn't go anywhere; she stays in the house.
    <br>She used to chat - she doesn´t chat anymore.
    <br>Even when there's no food in the house,  she doesn't go out.
    <br>She is always inside. She doesn't have any urge to go out.
    <br>What advice do you have for parents who are listening to you,
    <br>looking at where you are actually coming from?
    <br>What advice do you want to give to parents listening to you right now?
    <br>Miss Ayisha Idirisu & Mother
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>The first one I want to say is that divorcing is very bad.
    <br>The second one I have to say is that because of the business the daughter was doing
    <br>and bringing money home, she was not able to control her.
    <br>So parents, we should be able to control our children,
    <br>wherever they bring us something from outside.
    <br>We thank God for your life, Madam, and we know that God Almighty has delivered your daughter.
    <br>We just want to advise you, our sister, that now God Almighty has set you free
    <br>from all these evil spirits that caused you to be prostituting,
    <br>we pray that God Almighty in His infinite mercy will grant you the grace
    <br>to live the rest of your life for Him.
    <br>Make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>Be close to Christ Jesus and receive instruction from Him.
    <br>We pray that God will grant you the grace to do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>My name is Ayisha Idirisu. I´m from Ghana.
    <br>The lady beside me is my mom.
    <br>We are originally from Niger.
    <br>I was the lady who was delivered from the spirit of prostitution and now I'm free, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I have seen a lot of change - no more bad dreams.
    <br>I used to dream that I was flying, swimming in water,
    <br>eating in the dream and even having affairs in the dream.
    <br>Since I have been delivered, I am okay.
    <br>I no longer dream about those types of things.
    <br>I used to feel like having relationships with guys.
    <br>If I looked into a guy's eyes, he would just fall for me but now, I have tried it and it is no more.
    <br>So that spirit of lust has completely gone?
    <br>It has completely gone.
    <br>I used to smoke a lot; I used to smoke weed and cigarettes.
    <br>I don´t smoke, I don´t take alcohol anymore.
    <br>I don't even have the urge to do that again.
    <br>And during your testimony you said before, you would go on the internet,
    <br>use Facebook, post your pictures to attract men.
    <br>And now that you're delivered, what can you say about all of that?
    <br>I have stopped. I just planned that when I return to Ghana,
    <br>I will block all of my Facebook contacts and internet.
    <br>I'll block everything so that I will begin a new life.
    <br>Before you came to The SCOAN, just tell us the kind of area that you are living in before.
    <br>I was living with my friends in a ghetto house.
    <br>That was where I lived with my friends and did prostitution.
    <br>That place you are coming from is actually from an area where you are constantly with people
    <br>that are involved in that prostitution.
    <br>As you are going back to Ghana now, do you mean you are going to change that environment?
    <br>Yes, sure. I´m going to change that environment.
    <br>We thank God once again for our sister's life.
    <br>We know that the evidence of Christ Jesus is lives changed.
    <br>We just want to hear one word from your mother.
    <br>Mrs Hajara Ahmedu
    <br>Nigerian Living In Ghana
    <br>Her name is Mrs. Hajara Ahmedu and she´s from Ghana but originally from Niger.
    <br>I want to thank God for everything because now, my daughter has changed; I am happy.
    <br>My mom said she wants to thank God for everything because now, I have changed.
    <br>I have really changed and she is very happy. She wants to thank God for that.
    <br>We've heard all from our mother.  We thank God for the deliverance in the life of our sister.
    <br>Sister, we are here right now with a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The Man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua said that he really wants to support you in every area of your life
    <br>as you're going back to Ghana now to start a new life.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners worldwide,
    <br>we are here to present to you this cash gift of 2000 US Dollars
    <br>and also the Word of God, "The Mirror" which is just an encouragement
    <br>for you to stay close to Jesus and make His word the standard for your life.
    <br>I can't even talk. I'm really shocked.
    <br>Seriously, because I didn't even expect this at all.
    <br>I never expected that at all. I'm really shocked.
    <br>I'm going to use this money to start a new life; to start a new business.
    <br>I thank God, Emmanuel TV, the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I'm free.
    <br>I am free; thank You, Lord!
    <br>Wow, thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Right now, we believe many people are watching you.
    <br>Even girls that are involved in prostitution.
    <br>Your people that knew you very well in the past may be watching you right now.
    <br>What is your advice to people that are involved in such a lifestyle?
    <br>My advice especially for ladies like me: They should change.
    <br>No matter who you are, just change and get close to God.
    <br>With God all things are possible.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ. We thank God for your life, sister.
    <br>We pray that God will give you the grace to continue to stay close to Jesus
    <br>and make use of this wonderful gift.
    <br>We believe that you're going to come back with more wonderful testimonies, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus, I am free!
    <br>I'm very happy. Thank You, Jesus!
