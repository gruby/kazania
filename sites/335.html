    <br>The hour has come.

    <br>Your deliverance is as close to you as your mouth.
    <br>Your healing is as close to you as your mouth.

    <br>I command right now, those on the wheelchairs - right now I command you - get healed!
    <br>Get healed!
    <br>I command your fluids, I command your bones, I command your tendons, I command your blood,
    <br>to get ready to receive life!
    <br>Be healed!

    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua continues to pray, the power of God storms the scene,
    <br>and people are being delivered from whatever sickness, and afflictions that have been tormenting their lives.
    <br>This is the proof that the Book of Acts is not mere history, but a pattern of what God wants His church to be.
    <br>Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday, today, and forever.
    <br>His power and effectiveness have not changed.
    <br>For where the power of God is, there is liberty, healing, and all of God's blessings.

    <br>There is power in the name of Jesus
    <br>To break every chain
    <br>After the mass prayer, people still remain under the influence of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The real, forceful and authentic power of God continues to move mightily through the stadium.
    <br>For where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>Many who possessed evil spirits began to manifest,
    <br>and those who were bound to their crutches for many years rose up and walked to the glory of God.
    <br>The lightning of God containing the resurrection power, flows through the stadium
    <br>as God Almighty restores them back to the original position He had created them.
    <br>There is power in the name of Jesus
    <br>To break every chain
