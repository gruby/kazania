    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Appolonia Ezeugwu and I am from Enugu State, residing in Nasarawa State.
    <br>This is my daughter and my daughter-in-law who were helping me when I was in the hospital.
    <br>This is the doctor's report - I suffered a disastrous accident on April 5th.
    <br>I sustained a fracture of the tibia and fibula on my legs.
    <br>These are the pictures of when I was in bed in hospital.
    <br>After four months, they discharged me with a wheelchair.
    <br>Because I was always sitting in one place, my husband bought the cable
    <br>where I can watch Emmanuel TV to keep me alive
    <br>because that was where my miracle came from.
    <br>I was watching Emmanuel TV and my faith grew.
    <br>I was desperate to come here until that fateful day, on Thursday, 22nd September,
    <br>when I watched a similar case.
    <br>It was the rebroadcast, when they brought a girl in the car.
    <br>I saw the man of God coming out and praying for the girl,
    <br>and in my mind I said, "If this girl stands up, I too will stand up and walk for the glory of God!"
    <br>The man of God prayed and the girl's leg was shaking.
    <br>I stretched my leg and I was shaking it, following the girl.
    <br>When the prayer finished, before the girl could say, 'Amen', I shouted 'Amen'!
    <br>The man of God told the girl to come out and I was in my wheelchair.
    <br>When the girl stood up, instantly, I didn't call anybody to help me.
    <br>Before, people had to help me when I tried to come down from the wheelchair.
    <br>But this time, I stood up with a righteous anger!
    <br>Broken Leg Healed While Watching Emmanuel TV!!!
    <br>Instantly, I felt like something falling down from my legs.
    <br>I bent down to see what fell out but I didn't see anything.
    <br>On raising my head up, I screamed and my husband and children came, everybody was shouting.
    <br>That was how I started walking up-to-date.

    <br>So can you just exercise your body and do the things you couldn't do before then,
    <br>when you were having this problem of the fracture of the tibia and the fibula.
    <br>You mean before now, you couldn't do this?
    <br>I couldn't come down from the wheelchair, talkless of bending down.
    <br>But now, the Lord has done it!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you walk in the midst of the people of God and let them see what the Lord has done in your life.
