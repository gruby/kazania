    <br>Season's Greetings and Merry Christmas to Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>from the Mayor of Bethlehem
    <br>Greetings from Bethlehem to Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Merry Christmas From Bethlehem!
    <br>Church of the Nativity
    <br>Bethlehem
    <br>The Birthplace of 
    <br>JESUS CHRIST
    <br>To my dear friend T.B. Joshua,
    <br>general overseer of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>Merry Christmas from the city and the capital of Christmas - from the city of Bethlehem.
    <br>This year our message to Bethlehem was delivered on the 3rd of December,
    <br>calling for peace, love and hope - the main message of Bethlehem.
    <br>Ringing the bells, the lighting of the tree will keep Bethlehem alive.
    <br>Being with us is very important,
    <br>to keep the message alive as long as Bethlehem is alive and divided.
    <br>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all,
    <br>to all prophets, supporters...
    <br>Thank you very much for supporting Bethlehem as well.
    <br>To my dear friend T.B. Joshua,
    <br>on behalf of the Franciscans in the Holy Land and the local Christians
    <br>I would like to wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year both to you and your family,
    <br>and to the members of your great church.
    <br>We know that you have a great love for the church in the Holy Land
    <br>and we look forward to being with you in a week or two to show you the many programmes
    <br>that we are doing to help the Christians in the Holy Land.
    <br>God bless you, and I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
    <br>Merry Christmas
