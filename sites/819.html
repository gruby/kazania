  <p>    
    <br>My name is Lucky Susu.
    <br>This is my first time to come to this church.
    <br>I was released from prison.
    <br>I want to thank God for what He has done in my life.
    <br>It happened like this:
    <br>I am wheelbarrow pusher in my market.
    <br>When people have a load to carry, I will carry it for them to the bus stop.
    <br>Some people will give me 100 naira, some will give me 150 or 200 naira.
    <br>In 2008, on the 9th of December, I brought two bags of rice and some tubers of yam to the bus stop.
    <br>Across the tarmac, they were some people gathered.
    <br>I crossed to see what was happening.
    <br>There was an old woman on the ground who a motor vehicle had hit.
    <br>She was bleeding.
    <br>I began to shout, that the people should rush to help this woman.
    <br>They said that the vehicle that had hit the woman had driven away
    <br>and said, "Don't you know, this is Lagos".
    <br>I felt for the woman and decided to try and save her life.
    <br>I took the money that I had suffered for to help my family
    <br>to take the woman in a taxi to hospital in Agota.
    <br>We reached the hospital but the woman died in the hospital.
    <br>Then, the doctor called the police and they arrested me.
    <br>They charged me with murder.
    <br>Last week, a man came to the prison on Friday.
    <br>When he came, he was wearing a Faith Bracelet on his wrist from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I explained to the man that I did not steal or kill but they still kept me there.
    <br>I asked him to keep me in his prayers.
    <br>The man said that the Faith Bracelet he was wearing was from The SCOAN
    <br>and that I should hold his hand.
    <br>One of the 15 people I have given to.
    <br>The person quickly called me.
    <br>The Faith Bracelet
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You'll see the wise men - they are always wearing and praying with it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We call it Faith Bracelet.
    <br>You count your faith.
    <br>If I am not here now, I am busy with it.
    <br>If I am inside the vehicle, if I am sitting down like you -
    <br>if I were the one sitting down now, I would be busy with it.
    <br>You would see me sitting down busy with it.
    <br>While talking to you, the divine nature of me is busy.
    <br>While Mr T.B. Joshua is talking to you, the divine nature will be busy counting faith.
    <br>Because a break in faith is a break in God.
    <br>That time, I was in the maximum security prison, at Ikoyi.
    <br>Then, they transferred me to another place
    <br>where they keep robbery suspects waiting for judgement.
    <br>My mind was telling me that the same thing would happen to me.
    <br>A prayer came to my mind, "God of T.B. Joshua, if You are really alive..."
    <br>- I was holding the Faith Bracelet.
    <br>"If You are really alive and You work, remove me from the problem I am in
    <br>because I am innocent".
    <br>When I finished the prayer, I waited until evening before I slept
    <br>and prayed the same prayer again.
    <br>That night when I slept, the man of God appeared to me in a dream.
    <br>He spoke to me and said, "My Child, God has heard your cry and you are innocent".
    <br>He said that I should keep on doing the good that I used to do and
    <br>that I should not resign myself to suffering.
    <br>He said I would go home the next day.
    <br>That was on Tuesday night, going to Wednesday morning last week.
    <br>At around after 3 am, before it reached 4 am,
    <br>I heard my name at the gate: "Susu".
    <br>My mind was telling me that they wanted to take me to kill me;
    <br>so, I went to hide in the lavatory and began to cry.
    <br>They came and dragged me outside and then said that I had no case to answer.
    <br>Emmanuel! 
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>After they left me when we got outside, I walked towards Oshodi.
    <br>When I arrived there, I explained myself to a woman who gave me 150 naira.
    <br>I collected the money, kept it and then used it to get here this morning.
    <br>When I reached here, I was wearing the clothes I wore in the prison.
    <br>They are here, inside this bag.
    <br>They are the clothes I was wearing while in prison.
    <br>I arrived here and asked them to allow me to enter the church but they refused.
    <br>I asked them if I could join the people under the canopy
    <br>but they didn't allow me to enter there.
    <br>Let's see the clothes you wore here from prison.
    <br>Lucky Susu
    <br>Faith Bracelet Testimony
    <br>The clothes are here as well as the slippers I was wearing.
    <br>After I got here and they did not allow me to enter,
    <br>I went to sit down by that red gate outside and began to cry.
    <br>As I was crying, this morning, a man approached me and asked me why I was crying.
    <br>I explained my situation to him.
    <br>The man asked me to follow him which I did.
    <br>He took me through the red gate.
    <br>He give me soap and water and told me not to cry anymore.
    <br>He told me to shower and took me to the bathroom.
    <br>When I finished showering, I wanted to put on the same trousers
    <br>when a man who was there told me that the man that brought me
    <br>had said that I should wait for him in the bathroom.
    <br>I waited and before 15 minutes were over, the man came.
    <br>He had gone to buy me new trousers, a new shirt and new sandals.
    <br>- The same man?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Do you know the man?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- But if you see him, you will know him?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>You will go and look for him.
    <br>The man then gave me 500 naira which is in my hand now.
    <br>He said I should put it in my pocket, that I shouldn't be left without any money.
    <br>He said I should hold it in case I wanted to buy anything.
    <br>Did you listen to what he said?
    <br>He said he was just coming from prison with those dirty wears.
    <br>On getting here, no one wanted to reckon with him.
    <br>They asked him to go and stay outside.
    <br>Suddenly a man just came and said, "Ah, what happened?
    <br>Why are you looking like that? Are you mental?"
    <br>He said, "No, I'm from prison".
    <br>The man took him, bought him a soap, took him to the bathroom,
    <br>bathed him, got him money, bought new clothes for him, gave him money and
    <br>carried him inside the church.
    <br>I think this man needs to be encouraged.
    <br>I don't know the man but we need to see the man.
    <br>He said while he was in the prison, last week, a man just walked into the prison.
    <br>He didn''t know whether he was one of the wardens or one of the preachers that preached to the prisoners.
    <br>He just encountered the man.
    <br>The man said, "Oh, what happened? Why are sitting quietly in dejection?"
    <br>He was able to narrate the story to the man,
    <br>"This is the reason why I am in here. I am innocent".
    <br>And the man said, "Yes. This bracelet with me, I want you to pray with me.
    <br>Let me remove it and put it on your hand and pray with you.
    <br>Just ask for your release.
    <br>Ask God to reveal to the authority the cause of your stay here.
    <br>Why you are here, so that they can know the truth. You will be released".
    <br>He removed it, wore it, prayed with the man and immediately...
    <br>He said that night after the prayer, he saw a vision
    <br>and a man came to him and said, "Look, you will be released".
    <br>The second day, he said the authority came and they called his name out.
    <br>That was how he was released.
    <br>And immediately he was released, he had to come to The Synagogue,
    <br>to come and share this testimony.
    <br>"Hey, I've never been to The Synagogue. I don't know a place called Synagogue."
    <br>But immediately he was released, he asked people around, "Where is The Synagogue?"
    <br>But the man that gave the bracelet could not wait; he just had to leave
    <br>because I know the man is going around everywhere to deliver people with the message.
    <br>Ok, maybe the man will be seeing it on Emmanuel TV now that this man is out.
    <br>So now he came here.
    <br>On getting here, with the uniform he wore in front of the church,
    <br>people were running from him because he looked tattered.
    <br>Somebody just came and said, "Look, why are you standing somewhere?
    <br>Are you mental? Do you want to go to the emergency?"
    <br>That was how the man rescued the situation.
    <br>Got him money to buy soap, took him to the bathroom, washed him,
    <br>got him new clothes, gave him money for feeding.
    <br>Can you go and look for the man, please.
    <br>Take him out and look for the man. Bring the man forward.
    <br>Please, he said he doesn't know the man  but when he sees the man, he will know.
    <br>Let us see the man.
    <br>Wow! So we can still see a good Samaritan like this.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If God is aware of your situation, your situation will not kill you but prepare you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If God is aware of your challenges
    <br>your challenges will not destroy you but prepare you.
    <br>Your challenges could be imprisonment; they could be temptation of any kind.
    <br>Such a situation may be allowed to strengthen your desire and your determination for God.
    <br>If God is involved, who else is involved does not matter.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: If God is involved, who else is involved does not matter.
    <br>So brother, continue your goodness.
    <br>The Good Samaritan Who Helped Mr Susu
    <br>Rise up! Glory, glory!
    <br>Wow!
    <br>Is it the man? Glory be to God!
    <br>Mr Susu With The Man Who Helped Him
    <br>Who is this?
    <br>This is the man who bought the clothes for me.
    <br>- Is he the one that bought soap?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Washed you?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Gave you clothes?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- And gave you money?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Mr Susu With The Man Who Helped Him
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brother, where did you see this man? Is he your brother?
    <br>No, sir. I saw him at the gate where he was crying.
    <br>He looked so dirty; so, I called him and listened to him.
    <br>I asked him, "Why are you like this?"
    <br>He told me that he was released last week from prison
    <br>and because of the way he looked, they didn't want him to enter the church.
    <br>I told him to follow me if that was the case.
    <br>I took him to the bathroom so he could shower and I got him a change of clothes.
    <br>- You bought him clothes?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- You bought him soap?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- And you waited there until he finished bathing?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>What else did you do?
    <br>I then brought him inside the church.
    <br>The Man Who Helped Mr Susu
    <br>What is your purpose of doing this?
    <br>Daddy we need to follow your footsteps.
    <br>He is one of the head of security - one of the head.
    <br>If this man has surplus and he is one of the head of security, he will do charity with it.
    <br>He will be giving the needy a lot.
    <br>Whilst he is doing the job there, he is giving out financial support.
    <br>Wow. We pray what you are doing now shall be permanent.
    <br>Ha. You might have been doing this because this one is too obvious
    <br>that is why we are aware of it. You might have been doing it for so long.
    <br>I know this man. It is true; in was in our market,
    <br>pushing a wheelbarrow for many years.
    <br>- You know who?
    <br>- I know this man.
    <br>He is very quiet. He would push a wheelbarrow.
    <br>If people bought a lot of items, he would help them to carry them.
    <br>For many years, I had not seen him; I thought he had relocated
    <br>and didn't know he was in prison.
    <br>You heard it from the woman coming out from the midst of the congregation,
    <br>testifying that what this man is saying is nothing but the truth.
    <br>In the same market that the man mentioned, at mile 12,
    <br>they knew him at the market as someone who pushed local trolleys to carry loads for people.
    <br>When they did not see him after some time, they thought he had relocated to another market,
    <br>not knowing that he was in prison.
    <br>We are still coming back to that. Let's settle the Good Samaritan.
    <br>What this security has done now is telling the gentleman that
    <br>he should not stop doing good.
    <br>Because of what has happened to him, he should not stop.
    <br>Don't stop doing good because God is aware of what happened to him.
    <br>Let's talk about this man first.
    <br>Because what he did now - assume he had not taken effort to buy this, to buy that,
    <br>to clothe the man, to get him to the bathroom and wash him,
    <br>there is no way we can see this man today.
    <br>He would not be able to come inside.
    <br>We would not be able to talk today about this man's predicament and the lesson we learnt.
    <br>I think for your charity, the ministry has to begin to establish people like this.
    <br>What we are even planning to do: Instead of our ministry to be doing it,
    <br>we want to have a kind of apostolic people.
    <br>If you are one of the apostolic, whatever the ministry can give you,
    <br>you will also be doing charity and every year we assess how far you have gone in charity.
    <br>The ministry can also be giving you money, some fund to be doing your charity there.
    <br>I think this man should be given 5 million to be starting the charity.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The 'Good Samaritan' To Receive 5 Million Naira For Works Of Charity
    <br>They should immediately because of position, the area where what he is doing there as a security;
    <br>there are many sick people that could not come.
    <br>There are many sick people when they get here, they are too sick; they cannot come in.
    <br>Some people, after the healing, they don't have money to go home.
    <br>Not of all them can reach us but the security there, he is there to quickly help them.
    <br>Immediately, get that cheque written and let him give testimony and let the world see.
    <br>5 million naira.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And not only that - we want to know, you that has been doing charity, where are you living?
    <br>Are you leaving comfortably?
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>We people of God are very happy to see a man like this in the house of God, working for God.
    <br>Not working for his pocket.
    <br>Wonderful.
    <br>All over the world, we want to have you over there.
    <br>If you are into charity, what can we do to support you and to showcase your case to the world?
    <br>I can be visiting you all over the world when you want to launch this charity.
    <br>We want to do it in a big way - scholarship given to deserving children,
    <br>supporting the widows and help the needy all over the world
    <br>and giving scholarships to the best candidates that deserve it.
    <br>Yes, rescue them.
    <br>Little kidnapped children, rescue them.
    <br>Go all the way to help mankind.
    <br>So that is it.
    <br>If you don't let this man know that it is good to do good,
    <br>irrespective of what comes, he will not do good again because he has seen pain,
    <br>affliction in doing good but we are saying, "No, no. Nothing can break me.
    <br>Nothing can separate me from doing good".
    <br>Stand up and tell your neighbour:
    <br>Nothing can separate me from doing good.
    <br>Can affliction?
    <br>Condemnation?
    <br>Even death?
    <br>What can separate you from doing good?
    <br>Say, nothing!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Many, when they begin to recast their experiences in doing good in the past,
    <br>they will tell you that they will never do good again.
    <br>No, nothing can separate me from doing good.
    <br>Can affliction, poverty, imprisonment, infirmity?
    <br>Nothing can separate me because Jesus is good all the time.
    <br>Now brother, continue doing good until death.

    <br>When you see the light at the end of the tunnel...
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Continue doing good until you see light at the end of the tunnel.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service.
    <br>I want to look at the picture of what has happened to our security personnel out there.
    <br>This is a similar thing that has happened, and I know revelation is coming.
    <br>I want to appreciate what they are doing.
    <br>This brother came here to prove to you that, 'Look, there is Godliness in them.
    <br>There is care, there is love'.
    <br>Please support them.
    <br>Any time you come, try to understand that they have many people to attend to.
    <br>Don't begin to look at them, don't just talk to them anyhow.
    <br>You have to be patient.
    <br>They need patience, endurance and perseverance from you.
    <br>You have to persevere and be patient because they attend to thousands of people.
    <br>It's not only you. If you just come to them, be patient.
    <br>Don't be in a hurry. If you are in a hurry meeting them, you may find them very tough.
    <br>It's nature.
    <br>Appreciate what they are doing.
    <br>This is one out of thousands that is going on.
    <br>They are many; they have done a lot.
    <br>So please, my message to you once again:
    <br>What you have passed through is as it should be by divine will.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service.
    <br>They were not to destroy or kill you but to prepare you.
    <br>Look at where you are today.
    <br>Take this message from me.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>What you are passing through is as it should be by divine will.
    <br>They are not to kill or destroy you but to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>Ask any great leader, they will tell you what they went through.
    <br>Read about the apostles in the Bible - you will see clearly that they saw darkness.
    <br>That was why they were able to maintain the good day they had that made them apostles.
    <br>Experience is the best teacher.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Opposite is the case now. What you were expecting - for the prophet to give to someone
    <br>who is testifying of prison is now given to a Good Samaritan.
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>It means, there is a journey ahead.
    <br>He still has some journey to pass through
    <br>before he begins to experience that comfort he is expecting.
    <br>He said he was pushing the trolley.
    <br>I was pushing the trolley in the past.
    <br>The market he is talking about, I was there in the past.
    <br>Those who have read some story about me...
    <br>It was in the midst of all this that the Lord took me to the place where He could use me.

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>You have seen during the service that the man of God addressed the issue of the brother
    <br>that was in the post of security service, helping the needy.
    <br>They meet thousands of these people during the course of their duty.
    <br>People in need come to the security post asking for help.
    <br>We saw the good work he did today by helping that man who was stranded.
    <br>And the man of God said live that he has taken the promise
    <br>to bless this man with this cheque of 5 million naira
    <br>to encourage him, to support him to go and do the good work.
    <br>The Bible says, the works of charity and works of righteousness go together.
    <br>When the man of God saw that, now he encourages this brother by giving him as he promised
    <br>that cheque of 5 million naira to encourage him to go and do the good work
    <br>in the ministry of charity to help the needy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
