  <p>    
    <br>My name is Miss Doris Ugbaji
    <br>I am from Benue State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am here to testify to the goodness of the Lord in my life.
    <br>I was delivered at The SCOAN from the spirit of woman, masturbation and pornography.
    <br>It all started when I was six years old.
    <br>My father used to bring some men into our house.
    <br>They would take me.
    <br>When I wanted to say, “Daddy, I don’t understand. What is this man here for?”,
    <br>he would say that I was a small child and didn’t know what I was doing.
    <br>I should keep quiet and see what he was going to do.
    <br>In the night, they would bring me out and use chicken to try and invoke some spirits into me.
    <br>We would go to a river, they would bathe me but I didn’t understand why.
    <br>When I was in primary school, I was brilliant and very intelligent but never knew what was happening.
    <br>When I got to school, they said they should take me to a boarding school.
    <br>I went to a boarding school, where I met a lady.
    <br>When I met the lady, she said she wanted me to be her friend.
    <br>I never knew that there was something attached or that she wanted to initiate me into anything.
    <br>On a fateful night, she called me to come to a corner because she had something to tell me.
    <br>I said, “OK, let’s go”.
    <br>At midnight, she woke me up and started touching me.
    <br>Something came over me and that was how I was initiated into the spirit of woman.
    <br>I started having affection for women.
    <br>She would touch me; I would touch her.
    <br>The next day, I came again.
    <br>We began to do it.
    <br>Whenever she saw me with another lady, she would begin to fight me,
    <br>asking why I was moving with the lady and what was happening.
    <br>I started having affection for women.
    <br>It affected my life in so many ways that even in class, I could not concentrate.
    <br>The next thing that would happen was she would come outside the window and give me a sign.
    <br>We would go to the dormitory.
    <br>I would say that I was not feeling fine or look for any excuse to go to the dormitory
    <br>so that me and her could have a good time.
    <br>From there, I started having affairs with many girls; I started dating women.
    <br>Wherever I went, if I saw them, I knew that this was the kind of spirit; we knew ourselves.
    <br>We didn't need to ask.
    <br>At times, I would be asked why I was moving with a girl and if there was anything we were doing.
    <br>I would say no and God forbid but it was a lie; inside me, I knew what I was doing.
    <br>When I came home, I pretended so that my mum would not know what was happening.
    <br>The next thing, I would be in my room.
    <br>Whenever I dreamt of a woman coming to me and making love to me, I would start masturbating.
    <br>OK.
    <br>So, you mean, apart from the physical meeting of this girl at school,
    <br>who initiated you into this practice of the spirit of woman,
    <br>you also used to have dreams of a woman coming to you.
    <br>Can you tell us more about that?
    <br>Yes, I used to have a dream.
    <br>A woman would come to me in a dream and whenever this woman came to me -
    <br>if I didn’t see any woman around to do it with, I would start masturbating.
    <br>I could masturbate in my room for two to three days; I would not come out.
    <br>I would not eat but I would be satisfied.
    <br>Whoever came to knock on my door, I would have the kind of anger that could kill somebody.
    <br>I would fight and say nobody should come to my door.
    <br>I would ask if they knew what I was doing in my room.
    <br>I was in a world of my own; I didn’t want anyone to advise me.
    <br>This spirit pushed me to be drinking and nobody knew that I was the kind of person who drank.
    <br>Because of how I looked, you would never know unless you caught me doing one thing or the other.
    <br>I started battling at school.
    <br>Before I finished my secondary school, I had to take the exam four times.
    <br>Nobody thought that I would go to a higher institution because
    <br>the kind of life that I was living was so dangerous.
    <br>So, you are someone that was very intelligent before this happened, right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But after this happened, all your grades, your study - you just put that idea out of your head, right?
    <br>Yes, I could not do anything in school.
    <br>Instead of me to concentrate, I would be looking for women to meet.
    <br>Wherever I met them, I would always be the man; they would be the woman.
    <br>When I managed to go to a higher institution, a lot of things happened to me but I managed to get through.
    <br>How did this spirit of woman also affect your relationships with men,
    <br>maybe boys were interested in having a relationship with you?
    <br>This spirit had affected me so much that I hated men; whenever I saw men, they irritated me.
    <br>I hated men; I didn’t like being around men.
    <br>When someone came to say they wanted to be my friend, I would say OK
    <br>but when they started dragging, I would hate them.
    <br>I didn’t have affection for men; I only had affection for women.
    <br>Even if I wasn’t doing anything with a woman, I preferred to be around women.
    <br>OK.
    <br>How did this affect you in your relationship with your family?
    <br>It had affected my relationship with my family in that there was no peace.
    <br>My mum, I hate--
    <br>If anybody should talk to me--
    <br>I would tell my dad that if he didn’t give me money, I would call armed robbers to come,
    <br>take it from him and give it to me.
    <br>I fought everybody.
    <br>I bought two jackknives so that nobody would talk to me or I would stab them.
    <br>They could not talk to me; there was no peace – everybody hated me.
    <br>My mum started saying that I was not the daughter she gave birth to;
    <br>something was wrong and it was not ordinary.
    <br>She told me to go The SCOAN; people were going there and I should too.
    <br>I said I didn’t want to come because I knew my spirit would be exposed
    <br>as I knew there were some spirits around me.
    <br>You knew right from that time that this was a spiritual problem?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>OK.
    <br>When you came here, during the mass prayer, tell us what was your experience?
    <br>During the mass prayer, I was there.
    <br>Before then, I met a youth and told him I didn’t understand my life,
    <br>I was facing a lot of challenges and didn’t know if I was coming or going.
    <br>The person said that I should go to mass prayer.
    <br>In my mind I said, “Which kind of mass prayer?”
    <br>I wanted to run away.
    <br>When I was trying to go, my legs became heavy and I could not go out.
    <br>I just managed to sit in one corner while they started the mass prayer.
    <br>That was where I was delivered from this spirit.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>We have many people in the auditorium today who have never experienced mass prayer before.
    <br>We want you to let us know; as the prayer was going on, what was your experience,
    <br>what was happening to you exactly? Describe that for us.
    <br>When I was about to go out, my whole body became hot.
    <br>I don’t know where the excess sweat coming out of my body came from.
    <br>I sat down while they were praying.
    <br>Then, I heard sounds like they were beating drums in my ears.
    <br>I was looking for a way out; I began to see darkness and felt heat all over my body.
    <br>I started vomiting and from there, I fell; I didn’t know what I was doing.
    <br>After the vomiting, we can see on the screen right now, the time that the evil spirit was manifesting in you.
    <br>Do you remember any of that?
    <br>No.
    <br>You don't remember that?
    <br>No.
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Truly, that was deliverance in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>After that experience, when you were delivered, tell us; what have been the changes you have seen?
    <br>To my own surprise, I found that after the deliverance, my phone which was like food to me
    <br>as I used to watch all kind of things on it, I wouldn’t sleep but now, I do not use my phone.
    <br>I feel it is like punishment to go online.
    <br>I started thinking straight that a woman should get married and have her own children.
    <br>I never thought there was something like that.
    <br>My mother would ask me, “You don’t want to get married; men are coming?”
    <br>I would think, “This old woman doesn’t even know what’s happening”.
    <br>I would not talk to her for a week; I would disappear from the house and go and meet my girlfriends.
    <br>Since then, the affection for women has gone?
    <br>Yes, everything has stopped.
    <br>I see women as my sisters; I don’t see them and think of dating anymore.
    <br>What about the dream you used to have of a woman coming to you in the night to torment you?
    <br>Yes, I used to dream about eating and different women coming to make love with me.
    <br>I don’t experience it anymore.
    <br>The only dream I have had was last night, I took a flight from where I was to The SCOAN.
    <br>I went to The SCOAN and landed. That was all.
    <br>Hallelujah, let's put our hands together for Jesus, the King of Glory!
    <br>With this deliverance you have experienced, we want you to advise viewers watching you all over the world,
    <br>and us, listening to you in the auditorium.
    <br>What is your word of advice?
    <br>My advice to viewers out there, especially young ladies and youth like me.
    <br>I know there are many people out there watching me.
    <br>I am not ashamed of anything; I am very happy to stand in the presence of God and giving this testimony.
    <br>There is nothing God cannot do.
    <br>The same God who delivered me will deliver those who have my problem.
    <br>There are a lot of them out there; I know how many I had been following.
    <br>Please, get ready for your deliverance and come to The SCOAN
    <br>because this was where I got my deliverance.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>That is a wonderful advice; when we have a problem, we should run to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
    <br>we should run to any living church, of which The SCOAN is just one.
    <br>We believe that as you continue to make God's Word the standard for your life; better is not good enough -
    <br>the best is yet to come for you and your family, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
