    <br>LEISURE TIME WITH PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Playing with nature is a leisure time with nature to ease tension and stress.
    <br>Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>I want to encourage you to often find a natural environment to read your Bible
    <br>because a natural environment is natural and free from distraction.
    <br>Nature itself enhances spirituality.
    <br>I often read my Bible in a calm and quiet environment
    <br>because the Bible is not like other books you can read anywhere and understand.
    <br>Understanding of the Bible is understanding the nature of God.
    <br>Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>It must be read in an enabling environment to understand it.
    <br>To live it, it must be read in an enabling environment.
    <br>To teach it, it can be read anywhere.
    <br>Leisure Time With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Leisure time - time to be refreshed and be renewed.
    <br>God's Word refreshes our mind.
    <br>God's Spirit renews our strength.
