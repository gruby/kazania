  <p>    
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua stands in the authority and power of the name of Jesus Christ
    <br>as he sets the people free from bondage with a touch or a simple look from God
    <br>that exposes the darkness hidden inside them.
    <br>There is no hiding place for demons when Jesus is on the scene.
    <br>Let us hear from the evil spirit inside this woman.
    <br>I gave her the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>I want to destroy her life with the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>I sleep with between 10 to 30 men - it depends.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>How did you enter her?
    <br>After she had finished with her school.
    <br>Knowing that the demon has been chained by the power of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Nkechi Uwaifo. I am from Delta state.
    <br>The person beside me here is my mother.
    <br>The next person here is my elder 
    <br>sister; her name is Justina.
    <br>The one near me is Faith, and the other one is Angela.
    <br>They are all my elder sisters.
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>When I was in school, somebody came to deceive us.
    <br>I wanted to write my exams in SS3 (Senior Secondary School).
    <br>Somebody came and deceived us 
    <br>that she wanted to take us to La Cote d' Ivoire.
    <br>There were 10 of us.
    <br>How old were you at that time?
    <br>By that time I was thirteen years.
    <br>And you were in what class?
    <br>I was going to a SS3 (Senior Secondary School).
    <br>So the person came and told us that she wanted to take us to La Cote d'Ivoire
    <br>and that there, we would continue our schooling.
    <br>When we got to La Cote d'Ivoire, she introduced us into prostitution.
    <br>She didn't tell us when we were in Nigeria hat she was taking us there to do prostitution.
    <br>When we got to La Cote d'Ivoire, she told us that we would be doing prostitution.
    <br>We had to pay the woman 400,000 CFA.
    <br>I told her that she did not tell us all these things when we were in Nigeria.
    <br>She said that we didn't have sense;
    <br>that didn't we see that many people were making money and building houses everywhere
    <br>and that we didn't want to be millionaires?
    <br>Then, we said we would do it because we didn't have a choice.
    <br>From there, the woman took us to the madam.
    <br>The madam called us and talked to us that we should do it and that she too was doing it.
    <br>She said that she paid the person who brought her to La Cote d'Ivoire 400,000 CFA.
    <br>and that we were going to pay the same amount before we would be free and on our own.
    <br>When she explained it to us like that, we said that we would do it.
    <br>When we started doing it in La Cote d'Ivoire, we started paying her the money.
    <br>I took four months to pay her the 400,000 CFA.
    <br>Sometimes, I slept with 10 to 20 men; it depended on when there were customers.
    <br>After that, she said that we should have our own place and she would rent a place for us.
    <br>We too should have our own place to do our own thing and begin to gather money
    <br>to start what we would be doing in life.
    <br>When she explained this to us, we told her no problem.
    <br>She rented a place for us and we started doing our own.
    <br>Then, we started gathering our own money.
    <br>For more than 8 years, I did not hear anything from my family.
    <br>Your family members were not aware that you had travelled?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You didn't tell anyone?
    <br>No, I didn't tell them.
    <br>I went to the person that brought me to La Cote d'Ivoire that I wanted to hear from my family.
    <br>He said that I should not worry and that he would get the number
    <br>for me.
    <br>He said that I should call my family but I should not tell them what I was doing in La Cote d'Ivoire.
    <br>He told me that I should lie to my family.
    <br>I agreed that I would speak to my family like that because they didn't know what I was doing.
    <br>I called my mother and she said that they had been looking for me for so many years.
    <br>When I told her I was in La Cote d'Ivoire, she asked me what I was doing there.
    <br>I told her that I was learning how to plait hair.
    <br>Another day, when I called them, they would ask if I was still plaiting hair in La Cote d'Ivoire.
    <br>I would say yes but I was lying to them.
    <br>Sometime later, they would call me again and I would lie to them that I was sewing.
    <br>I continued lying to them, telling them different types of stories.
    <br>So for how many years did you say your family did not see you?
    <br>For eight years.
    <br>You were in La Cote d'Ivoire doing the work of prostitution?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Okay, so what happened after that?
    <br>When I gathered my money, I went to Morocco; I said I wanted to travel to Spain
    <br>On my way to Spain, I got deported from Morocco to Mali.
    <br>In Mali, I started doing prostitution again to gather money to get to Spain.
    <br>When I had gathered enough money, I tried to get to Spain again.
    <br>But on my way to Spain, they deported me again; this made it two times now.
    <br>I came back to La Cote d'Ivoire again.
    <br>What were you planning to do to Spain?
    <br>It was the same prostitution.
    <br>Okay, so now you were deported twice from Spain back to La Cote d'Ivoire?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So what happened after that?
    <br>I met the father of my child.
    <br>This child here - Blessing.
    <br>He told me that he liked me and he wanted to marry me.
    <br>I said, okay, there was no problem and we started befriending each other.
    <br>Then, I got pregnant.
    <br>He told me that since for eight years, I had not seen my family,
    <br>he would like to follow me to go and see them.
    <br>From there, he started seeing my family and introduced himself as the father of my pregnancy
    <br>and that he wanted to marry me.
    <br>We then travelled to Warri in Delta State to his mother's place; he introduced me to his mother.
    <br>His mother told me that I should stay in her place to deliver my baby.
    <br>I said, "No problem, Mama. I will stay".
    <br>I told her that I didn't have any money to do any business in Nigeria.
    <br>She said that I shouldn't worry and that her son would send money for me.
    <br>I told her that I had money in the bank account of the father of my child.
    <br>I had money with him in his account.
    <br>I said that she should let him send the money to me for me to start business in Nigeria
    <br>as I didn't want to return to La Cote d' Ivoire anymore; I was tired.
    <br>The father of this child told me that I should not worry and that the money that was in the bank,
    <br>that the bank wanted to borrow the money and put interest on it for me
    <br>so that at the end of the year, the bank would gather all the money together for me.
    <br>I had gathered 1 million CFA by that time in La Cote d' Ivoire.
    <br>Out of the work of prostitution, you were able to gather that money?
    <br>Yes,
    <br>{So eventually, what now happened with the money?
    <br>The man was just telling me stories and until today, I have not seen the money.
    <br>I had to forget about the money.
    <br>So you mean he duped you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I just thought that as he had promised that he wanted to marry me, no problem.
    <br>I knew that through that promise he made, if he had money,
    <br>he would give me the money that was in his account back.
    <br>Then, I was pregnant with this girl.
    <br>At that time, I was still doing prostitution.
    <br>After having this child, I stopped doing prostitution.
    <br>After eight years, when you came back home, did your family accept you ?
    <br>Yes, they accepted me but I still went back to the father of my child.
    <br>I told them that I was going to Warri to go and deliver my child.
    <br>From there, after you delivered your child, what happened?
    <br>I delivered twins but they did not live.
    <br>Before this one?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Then, he called me and said that I should come back to La Cote d' Ivoire.
    <br>I didn't know that he was just deceiving me to use my money.
    <br>So you still found yourself back to La Cote d' Ivoire?
    <br>Yes
    <br>Doing what?
    <br>I was doing the same prostitution.
    <br>When this child was one year old, I came back to Nigeria for her to know my family.
    <br>My family did not know about this child.
    <br>Since I came back with this child, I did not go back to La Cote d' Ivoire.
    <br>When I wanted to go back again, after my family had seen my child,
    <br>I went to meet the father of this child.
    <br>I said, "See what is happening; I don't have money for me to start again in Nigeria.
    <br>Nobody wants to help me".
    <br>Okay. Tell us how you eventually came here.
    <br>What happened? How did you come to The SCOAN? Who brought you here?
    <br>It was my mother who told me that I should come here for deliverance.
    <br>Okay, after eight years you went back again?
    <br>Yes,
    <br>So altogether, how many years were you doing this work?
    <br>That is 12 years.
    <br>Twelve years?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>For this 12 years, can you give an account of anything you acquired -
    <br>maybe money, property, car, house or anything that you were able to get
    <br>as a result of this work of prostitution.
    <br>Nothing!
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Both fathers of these children are not alive; I am the one taking care of these children.
    <br>because I still went back and struggled to have money to train these children
    <br>through doing prostitution here in Nigeria also.
    <br>Okay, can you now tell us how you came to The SCOAN.
    <br>It was my mother who introduced me to The SCOAN, that I should come for deliverance.
    <br>Okay, so when you came, what happened?
    <br>When I came that Monday, the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me, I just fell down.
    <br>The spirit inside me began to manifest that it wanted to make my life useless.
    <br>It confessed that it was the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>Then, he delivered me. Now, I am free and I thank God that I am free!
    <br>I am not going back again.
    <br>That night the man of God prayed for me, in a dream, I felt something come out
    <br>of the back of my head; I thought it was a rat.
    <br>I was surprised but I thought that a rat could not enter this house.
    <br>I slept and in another dream, I saw somebody with a giant hand touch me and I fell down.
    <br>That night, I woke up and started 
    <br>praying.
    <br>I said, "God, this deliverance that I 
    <br>have been waiting for, I have received it".
    <br>So that was before the man of God prayed for you?
    <br>The day the man of God touched me was the day that I had that dream.
    <br>Since after that time, can you tell us what happened.
    <br>I still had another dream.
    <br>I saw myself preaching to people who were doing prostitution.
    <br>I told them that they should not do 
    <br>this work.
    <br>Leave that life, work and face God. God has solution.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So you could not imagine yourself, seeing yourself in the dream, preaching to people
    <br>who are doing the same work you were doing for 12 years - the work of prostitution.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Apart from that, tell us: What are the changes you have noticed after your deliverance?
    <br>Do you still have the urge to go out and meet men, to run away from home, to travel out?
    <br>Do you still have such urge?
    <br>No. Now, if I sleep, I will sleep
    <br> like a baby and wake up.
    <br>I now dream good dreams for my life, even seeing myself praying but before, I did not pray.
    <br>If I said that I would pray, I would just go and sleep.
    <br>Sometimes, people would come to sleep with me; I'd be doing prostitution in the dream
    <br>but since the man of God delivered me, I have not seen that kind of thing again.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the king of glory!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>One more thing we would like to hear from you because people are listening to you,
    <br>they are learning from what you are saying.
    <br>Many people would have a reason for going out into such a job as prostitution -
    <br>maybe because of msltreatment from their parents, their family.
    <br>Was there any maltreatment from your family before you decided to travel out for this job?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Back when I was small, I thought that my sisters and mother did not like me.
    <br>Sometimes, I thought that they hated me.
    <br>That was why when I went to Agbor, that spirit that influenced me to travel was able to enter me.
    <br>Okay. Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My name is Grace Uwaifo. I am from Delta State.
    <br>She is my daughter Nkechi; the rest are her elder sisters.
    <br>I thank God for her life.
    <br>Two weeks ago, when she came here, she received her deliverance.
    <br>Before then, she always cried, telling me she wanted to go back to La Cote d'Ivoire.
    <br>One day, when I came home, she would have killed herself or gone back to La Cote d'Ivoire.
    <br>I would tell her, "No. One day God will deliver you from this spirit".
    <br>because I knew that it was not ordinary.
    <br>She came to collect money for WECC and NECO exams.
    <br>She used the money to travel out and 
    <br>for eight years, nobody heard about her.
    <br>It was eight years.
    <br>Then, she came and went back for four years before she came back with this baby.
    <br>Okay. We thank God Almighty. So how do you feel now, seeing that your daughter is delivered?
    <br>I thank God for her deliverance. I am very happy.
    <br>Can we hear from one of the sisters.
    <br>Please tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Justina. I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>As a young child, I was sent on to further my education,
    <br>so no one was there to watch after her.
    <br>Coming across the wrong set of people was how she just began to waste her years.
    <br>Now, I believe that the past is over and the best is yet to come for her.
    <br>Thank you. Shall we clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Miss Nkechi Uwaifo & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>My name is Faith Okonkwo.
    <br>I thank God for my life and for what He has done in my sister's life.
    <br>I thank God that she came back and was delivered.
    <br>I give God the glory; I give God the honour.
    <br>For how many years did you not seen her?
    <br>For 12 years.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>My name is  Gbadebo Angela.
    <br>I'm the elder sister to Nkechi.
    <br>I want to use this medium to appreciate God for deilvering my sister,
    <br>for bringing my sister safely back and alive after going astray.
    <br>I want to use this medium to advise the youth, most especially the young girls
    <br>that they should be content with what they have.
    <br>They should appreciate their families.
    <br>They should hold on to the Word of God and believe that their present condition
    <br>is not the final stage of their life; the best is yet to come.
    <br>If we pray, hold on to God and work hard, we will definitely get to where we want to go.
    <br>Amen. Thank you very much. Thank you.
    <br>Miss Nkechi Uwaifo & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>My advice for the viewers, most especially to the young girls
    <br>and those who are doing this prostitution,
    <br>let them run to God who delivered me, for them to have their own deliverance.
    <br>That work is not a good work.
    <br>Thank you. Let us clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>A word is enough for the wise, so we thank God Almighty for your life once again.
    <br>Now that you are delivered, we want to 
    <br>encourage you to stay true to our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>to embrace the wonderful Word of God as the most effective instrument for change.
    <br>Now the spirit of prostitution has been cast out, you need to build the character of God
    <br>and this can only happen by making the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>We pray that the Lord Almighty will give you the grace
    <br>to make the Word of God the standard for your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We believe that this deliverance will bring total deliverance to the entire family, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Let us clap for Jesus one more time.
    <br>Miss Nkechi Uwaifo & Family
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>After the service, the Emmanuel TV team met up with Nkechi Uwaifo and her family once again
    <br>to hear their thoughts on the next step for the family in the light of her wonderful deliverance.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel, viewers! God is with us!
    <br>We thank God for everything that the Lord God Almighty has done in this service today.
    <br>In the course of the service today, while the testimonies were going on,
    <br>we saw our sister here who came with her family members to share the testimony
    <br>of her deliverance from her past life of prostitution.
    <br>Today, she's a new person in Christ Jesus and she's here with her family right now
    <br>to say what is the next plan after her 
    <br>deliverance and her testimony today.
    <br>So sister, once again, can you tell us your name and of those who are standing with you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Nkechi Uwaifo from Delta State.
    <br>These are my elder sisters and my mother.
    <br>I thank God for what He has done for me,
    <br>using the man of God to deliver me from my past life of prostitution.
    <br>I pray to Almighty God that I will never go back to my past life again.
    <br>I will serve God in truth and in spirit.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for everything. So you mean, now that you are delivered
    <br>and you have shared the testimony of your deliverance,
    <br>you're going back to start a new life and not going back to your old way of life, is that right?
    <br>Yes, I promise God.
    <br>Let us also hear from members of your family
    <br>because we believe now that they have accepted you back,
    <br>they also understand that they have a role to play
    <br>to make sure that this deliverance is maintained.
    <br>So sister, once again tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Justina
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I want to thank God for what happened today in the life of my sister.
    <br>I give God all the glory.
    <br>We promise to support her in any way we can.
    <br>My husband and I have decided to take care of the little girl
    <br>so that Nkechi can start her life all over again.
    <br>I will support her in any way I can so that she can get her life back.
    <br>Everyone makes mistakes; we believe she has made a mistake and has learnt from it.
    <br>She is going to start her life afresh and I know God has plans for her.
    <br>Every one of us will contribute in trying to see that she gets back on her feet.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>We thank God Almighty. That is the love that our Lord Jesus Christ has been preaching
    <br>that we should learn to forgive one another and also to help one another's weakness.
    <br>Okay. Our dear sister, now that your past is over
    <br>and you have shared your testimony today before the congregation,
    <br>the anointed man of God, together with the Emmanuel TV partners, wants to support you
    <br>so that you can start a new life.
    <br>That is, choose whatever business you want to go into
    <br>so that you will not have any cause to remember and go back to your old way of life of prostitution.
    <br>In view of this, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, together with the Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>has sent this 200,000 Naira for you to start something doing and take care of yourself.
    <br>We believe that God Almighty will continue the supply.
    <br>Also in addition, we have 'The Mirror' book and this is also to help you
    <br>to maintain the deliverance you have received.
    <br>That is the Word of God that is authored by the anointed man of God himself, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I thank God for what He has done for using the man of God
    <br>to give me this opportunity to start a new life.
    <br>I pray to Almighty God that in my next visit here,
    <br>I am going to testify of glory and
    <br>honour for all that God has done for me, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I thank you, Man of God, for what you have done; you will never lack in your life or your family.
    <br>Long life will be your portion, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Thank you to the Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>I pray to Almighty God: May God guide the Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>long life and prosperity, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I want to say a very big thank you to the great man of God and Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>I want to thank you for your love and support, both morally and financially.
    <br>I pray the good Lord will attend to every one of our needs, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I thank God. My children have said it all.
    <br>I thank God, the man of God and Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>I thank them; may God continue to bless them
    <br>I pray for more grace for the man of God - more grace, anointing
    <br>and strength to continue his work.
    <br>God bless the man of God.
    <br>I want to say I thank God for what 
    <br>He has done in my sister's life.
    <br>We give all the glory, we give all the honour to God.
    <br>Father, we thank you.
    <br>May your name be glorified, in Jesus' name. Amen.
    <br>I will support her in any way, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I am really grateful for a day like this.
    <br>I have prayed for a day like this and I thank God that it came to pass.
    <br>I want to use this medium to thank the Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>For Prophet T.B. Joshua, I pray for more anointing upon his life.
    <br>I pray for strength to carry on the work of the Lord
    <br>and I pray that God will strengthen and protect him.
    <br>God will protect Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>Whatsoever be their hearts' desires all over the world, I pray that God will grant them.
    <br>Wherever this money has come from, the source will never run dry in Jesus' name.
    <br>For my sister, I pray that God will sustain her, maintain this deliverance - it shall be permanent,
    <br>Every power that wants to take her back to her past
    <br>is hereby condemned today, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>I pray I will support her in every way I can, for her to be saved forever, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Now that it is all over, we want to see that love being well expressed.
    <br>With what God has blessed her with, very soon, we believe that our sister is coming back
    <br>to share a testimony of the breakthrough that will come out
    <br>of this wonderful gesture she has received today, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
