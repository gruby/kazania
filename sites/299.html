  <p>    
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>I can hear breakthrough!
    <br>My business, breakthrough!
    <br>My family, breakthrough!
    <br>My finances, career, destiny, health, country, nation - breakthrough!
    <br>No breakthrough!
    <br>This one says, "No breakthrough".
    <br>I block them!
    <br>Do you agree with him?
    <br>No!
    <br>This is to tell you there is breakthrough.
    <br>Indeed, satan is powerless in the face of God's armour.
    <br>This man begins to feel uncomfortable as the fire of the Holy Ghost consumes the evil spirit in him.
    <br>Do the sign you do now.
    <br>No breakthrough, I block them.
    <br>You say what?
    <br>I blocked all the blessings.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Look - this is a sign that we are getting there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you are praying and one of them comes out to say, "No breakthrough",
    <br>that means that, they are the ones that are giving you this trouble that you are carrying.
    <br>If the message touched them that you have been released,
    <br>they have to fight back.
    <br>Say, "I have been released!"
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>If Jesus released you, you are released perpetually!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am Lakozi, the lord of darkness.
    <br>The wise men will deliver him.
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Wiseman Daniel moves throughout the congregation,
    <br>being used by God Almighty as a channel of healing and deliverance in Jesus' name.
    <br>As Wiseman Daniel moves, the power of God comes on the scene
    <br>and uproots whatever that had not been planted by God in the lives of the people.
    <br>Remember, demons are the cause of the enormous growth of pain, bitterness, disappointment,
    <br>sickness, that is going on around the world today.
    <br>Look at this man.
    <br>Upon touching him, the evil spirit that possessed him is arrested by the fire of the Holy Ghost,
    <br>and he becomes very uncomfortable.
    <br>Let's see how he was delivered in Jesus' name.
    <br>All over your body - fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You wicked spirit, come here!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body - fire!
    <br>Come here and talk!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Who are you? Speak out!
    <br>I am the spirit of lies.
    <br>How many of you are in this body?
    <br>We are many.
    <br>Who is the first person?
    <br>Lies.
    <br>Second?
    <br>Destroyer.
    <br>Third?
    <br>Killer.
    <br>Fourth?
    <br>Stealing.
    <br>Fifth?
    <br>Disturbance.
    <br>What have you all done to this body?
    <br>We are killing, destroying him. We don't want him here.
    <br>You do not want him here?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How far have you gone in destroying him?
    <br>We have put cancer in his body and it is eating him.
    <br>What else have you done to him?
    <br>We have destroyed his spirit, he doesn't have love, only anger and hatred.
    <br>What does this man do for a living?
    <br>He is a hydraulic filter engineer
    <br>and he was a minister of us, the USL.
    <br>What things have you done to the career of this man?
    <br>We have destroyed him.
    <br>How?
    <br>Stealing at work, instigating fights at work.
    <br>What else have you done to him?
    <br>We have made him to rape, sodomize, as he was sodomized.
    <br>What happened to him afterwards?
    <br>Afterwards, he was trained to be the USL leader - the United Satanic Leaders in South Africa.
    <br>As the head of this occultic background, what are the things you have done to him?
    <br>We have done many things and sent him to do many things.
    <br>What are the things you've sent him to do? What is his mission on this earth?
    <br>His mission is to destroy all the churches of God - the living churches.
    <br>His mission is to destroy all churches of God?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>- The living churches?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- How possible is that?
    <br>- It is possible.
    <br>- How?
    <br>- By confusing all the members of the churches.
    <br>How far have you gone in doing that?
    <br>Spreading the Word of God in a wrong way.
    <br>Spreading the Word of God in a wrong way - how?
    <br>By telling the children of God that God is the God who supplies and loves
    <br>but not the way they think and not the way the pastors are preaching.
    <br>How do you manipulate them?
    <br>We use our holy communion.
    <br>- You use your holy communion?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- Your own holy communion?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>What is the difference between your holy communion and the right one?
    <br>The difference is that in our holy communion,
    <br>we buy the juice, the red wine and take our blood and mix with it.
    <br>Then, we let them drink it.
    <br>When they drink it, what would happen to their spiritual lives?
    <br>Before we mix it, we pray over our blood.
    <br>We call on all demons to enter.
    <br>When they drink, they become demon-possessed.
    <br>- They become demon-possessed?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>How many have you succeeded in initiating through these means?
    <br>Many in South Africa.
    <br>We have finished churches.
    <br>We don’t want you. We don’t want T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You say you destroyed churches.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Any living church that has the Spirit of God - can you enter it?
    <br>Every living church like this one.
    <br>Because this church has raised true leaders as they are the appointed right ones
    <br>of Jehovah God and we are against that.
    <br>You are against that?
    <br>We are against that.
    <br>What is your mission here?
    <br>My mission here - I didn’t want my son to come here; this one you are talking to.
    <br>I wanted him to stay back and your prophet, father, the right appointed one,
    <br>prayed against our plans.
    <br>We were supposed to destroy South Africa on the 16th and 17th.
    <br>Again, your father destroyed our plans.
    <br>What were the plans you intended to execute that my mentor, Prophet T.B. Joshua, has destroyed?
    <br>This young man was not supposed to come here.
    <br>We had planned with our police – the SAPS group.
    <br>We had planned to stop him at the airport but he escaped.
    <br>You said you do not want my mentor, Prophet T.B. Joshua, to get into South Africa.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Why? What has he done to you?
    <br>Why do you not want him to go to South Africa?
    <br>We don’t want him to come to South Africa because he will reveal the truth of the true church.
    <br>Is that why you do not want him to go to South Africa?
    <br>Yes, because he is going to destroy our evangelists, prophets and pastors.
    <br>Does it mean that you have people you call prophets and evangelists?
    <br>Yes, we’ve got our own who inject their blood into the wine for our holy communion.
    <br>You have people that disguise to be pastors, prophets, evangelists?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What is the difference between them and true prophets?
    <br>The true prophets act on the Word,
    <br>and by acting on the Word, they are activating the power of the Word in them.
    <br>What about the ones you are using? From your demonic kingdom?
    <br>The false prophets, they preach only; they don’t act on the Word.
    <br>Now that you here, what do you want to do now?
    <br>Now, we have planned to confuse the church, to spread the spirit of confusion,
    <br>for the church to doubt their blessings.
    <br>What is the trouble a living church is causing to your demonic kingdom?
    <br>A living church causes big problems to our kingdom.
    <br>What kind of problem?
    <br>The water that the Prophet is using is like floods of water coming into our kingdom
    <br>and destroying our connections.
    <br>Now you are talking about this?
    <br>It is fire; it is killing my eyes.
    <br>It is doing what?
    <br>It is killing my eyes.
    <br>But this is ordinary water.
    <br>Floods of fire.
    <br>What is the difference between this and ordinary water?
    <br>It is a big difference because this one has been touched from Heaven.
    <br>So right now, you wicked spirit - it is time you leave this body.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>All over your body - fire! Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out! Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ! Out!
    <br>You demon - out!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, sir?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>Do you remember what happened to you?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>That very demon that has tormented you and your career is out.
    <br>Give thanks to God. You are free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank You, God!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>As we know, there are many many valuable lessons, that we are going to learn from our brother's experience,
    <br>and many important insights into the spiritual world, so we as Christians can be fully equipped
    <br>to stand firm and strong in our relationship with God.
    <br>So, once again - viewers all around the world, brothers and sisters in Christ here - let us listen carefully
    <br>to our brother and open our hearts as we receive the message of God through his words.
    <br>So brother, you are welcome. Can you first introduce yourself to us?
    <br>Tell us your name and where are you from.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Lawrence Moala from South Africa.
    <br>I am happy to be here.
    <br>I was in a satanic occult.
    <br>I was initiated into the occult when I was 11 years old, in 1988.
    <br>I grew up in the occult.
    <br>The only thing I knew was what I was taught being raised in an occult.
    <br>I was initiated by one of the elders in the family.
    <br>I remember there was one day, he took me to a mountain in South Africa.
    <br>According to our tradition, young men at the early age of 11 years and older
    <br>are taken to the mountain to be made men.
    <br>He told me that he was taking me there to make me a true man.
    <br>I went there, thinking that I was going to be a true man but
    <br>when we went into the mountain, it was no longer that.
    <br>He sodomised me there as part of the occult initiation.
    <br>From there, he told me, “You must not be worried because on the third day,
    <br>you must come back here and I will introduce you to the king of the occult
    <br>which is the king of the world we are living in”.
    <br>He said, “Only those who are introduced into this occult are the chosen ones,
    <br>so you are the chosen one”.
    <br>On the third day which he spoke about, we went back.
    <br>In his hand, there was a charm.
    <br>In South Africa, we know it as ‘umuti’.
    <br>We went into the mountain and he told me that we must bow because
    <br>that day I was going to be introduced to the king of the occult
    <br>who was going to give me the power to be one of the chosen ones of the occult.
    <br>He told me that we must bow and we did.
    <br>Then, he started praying in the way of the occult, in the tongues of the occult.
    <br>As he was praying, he told me that
    <br>he had to take a drop of my blood and mix it with the charm,
    <br>so that I could throw it in the water.
    <br>In that mountain was water.
    <br>He said, “I want to throw it in the water and it will call the king of the occult to come out and initiate you”.
    <br>He took a drop of my blood, mixed it with the charm and threw it in the water.
    <br>As he was making incantations, there was a wind blowing and surrounding us
    <br>and then it went back to the water.
    <br>I saw the water opening and then something like a monster, half-human and half snake, came out.
    <br>He told me, “You don’t have to fear; this is our god, the god of the occult.
    <br>He is going to give you the power”.
    <br>As he came out physically, I feared.
    <br>I wanted to cry but he told me, “Don’t fear”.
    <br>I still remember that he repeated it, “Don’t fear. This is your god”.
    <br>Then, lucifer came out.
    <br>He came out with the body of a snake, crawling.
    <br>He came to me but in his hand, he held something.
    <br>That elder told me that I must not fear because what he had in his hand,
    <br>he was going to give me and I must swallow it.
    <br>As he was speaking, he was crawling and coming closer.
    <br>Then, he told me to open my mouth.
    <br>I opened my mouth and he gave me that thing.
    <br>I swallowed it.
    <br>As I swallowed it, I felt as if there was a spirit planted in me.
    <br>Something just raised up.
    <br>He told me that I must not fear, that I must just wait until the god kissed me.
    <br>He came closer, kissed my lips and from there, I fainted.
    <br>That was how I was initiated.
    <br>From there, I woke up at home. I don’t know how I got home.
    <br>I woke up there and I wanted to find the elder to explain how I got home.
    <br>I went to the place I had found him.
    <br>I asked him, "How did I get home?"
    <br>I still remember that he told me,
    <br>"Son, you don't have to fear and you don’t have to trouble yourself.
    <br>Now, you are a full member of this satanic occult".
    <br>So, what you are saying here happened physically?
    <br>That one happened physically at that mountain in South Africa.
    <br>He came with a book and said it was a secret book.
    <br>To you Christians, it would seem like a Bible
    <br>but it is a bible that is black in colour and red on the sides.
    <br>He told me that the book was a secret book for the chosen ones of the cult.
    <br>He asked me, "Do you see the colour of this book?"
    <br>I said, "Yes, I see".
    <br>He said, "On top, the cover is black; do you see it?"
    <br>I said, "Yes, I see it".
    <br>He said, "It means that all of us born in the world were born into darkness".
    <br>I said, "I understand that".
    <br>He said, "But we need light and wisdom".
    <br>I said, "Yes, I understand that".
    <br>He said, "To get into the light to have wisdom, do you see this red colour?"
    <br>I said, "Yes, I see it".
    <br>He said, "We have to go into the light and get wisdom through the blood".
    <br>I said, "I don't understand." He said, "Yes, you won't understand but now,
    <br>you will understand because I am teaching you.
    <br>Through the blood – not the blood of goats, cows but of human beings -
    <br>you will enter the light and then you will have wisdom".
    <br>Then he said, "What you ate there in that mountain was a light
    <br>that will give you connection to the god in the mountain".
    <br>I asked, "How?" He said, "Inside of you, there are two pyramids and an eye.
    <br>I said, "Eye?" He said, "Yes".
    <br>He said, "This eye in you would make you hear the god in the mountain
    <br>when he speaks to you". I asked, "Which god?"
    <br>He said, "The one who we all worship; his name is lucifer.
    <br>He is our king and he is our leader and we work for him on this earth".
    <br>I was shocked.
    <br>He told me, "Now, you are the great of the greatest but you must maintain it".
    <br>Then, I asked, "How should I maintain it?"
    <br>He replied, "Now, you must start fighting that whatever the eye in you,
    <br>the spirit, would talk because the eye in you has the spirit".
    <br>I remembered because the time in the mountain when I ate that thing,
    <br>there was something like a spirit that was planted in me.
    <br>From there, I remember that my life was full of destruction -
    <br>everything I was doing was hell itself.
    <br>Destroying, deceiving and stealing. I was led by the spirit of anger.
    <br>We are just listening to our brother who explained his full initiation process.
    <br>Brother, we want to go to the area of the assignment that you were given in this satanic cult.
    <br>What was your own assignment and how did you go to carry it out in this earth?
    <br>I was initiated in 1988. So, in the occult itself, I've got 24 years experience.
    <br>In 1996, I was told that there was a special mission that we must do.
    <br>I asked myself what the special mission was.
    <br>The elder of the occult told me that we must go to the bush
    <br>where we would meet our king, lucifer himself.
    <br>We went there, met him and they gave us a special mission.
    <br>The special mission was to destroy the angel of God in this world, in human body.
    <br>I asked who the angel of God was.
    <br>They said that the angel of God's mission was to raise the dead churches
    <br>and leaders that we, through the power of demons, had destroyed.
    <br>In our mission to destroy the churches, we used the power of demons
    <br>to deceive many men of God in South Africa to manipulate,
    <br>speak badly about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The angel behind T.B. Joshua himself, they told us that,
    <br>that was the angel we must be against and destroy -
    <br>destroying him by the power of the demons, spreading lies that he was a liar,
    <br>he was part of satanism and that he was not sent by God.
    <br>We used many things that they taught us in deceiving people
    <br>and many men of God in South Africa through the power of demons.
    <br>We used the holy communion in their churches.
    <br>First, before we would use the holy communion, we would deceive them.
    <br>We captured their minds so that they would allow us to be part of them
    <br>and to be part of the departments in their churches.
    <br>What we did was, we gained their trust so that they would trust us.
    <br>Most of them trusted us because we came to them
    <br>as if we were having the power of prophesying.
    <br>We came to them offering because most of them,
    <br>we knew that they were lacking financially.
    <br>So, we were diverting them away from God as their Provider
    <br>for them to focus on us as their providers.
    <br>We captured their minds, they focused on us and gave us positions
    <br>in the departments of their churches.
    <br>The departments we rushed to the most were the holy communion department -
    <br>that was the most important one and the counselling department.
    <br>In the holy communion, we were mixing our blood with the red juice and red wine
    <br>so that we would give it to the Christians and by that, they were automatically initiated.
    <br>In our churches, we used holy water because we knew that
    <br>God is using the blood and water so we faked them; we made our own.
    <br>We knew that Christians believe in it and it is working so we faked our own.
    <br>We mixed the water with our semen because semen is part of our lives.
    <br>We gave it to them and they were initiated.
    <br>Most of them, once drinking it, would have dreams.
    <br>Some of them would dream of people coming after them, chasing them.
    <br>Some of them saw people stabbing them.
    <br>Some of them had dreams seeing themselves eating flesh, killing each other.
    <br>That was the way we were initiating.
    <br>Brother, you mentioned that one of the methods you used was to enter the minds of people
    <br>especially men of God, to be spreading rumours, negative things about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Can you tell us why were you doing this?
    <br>What was the purpose of your entering people to spread rumours about Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>We were told that he is the right, appointed, anointed Prophet to raise the dead leaders
    <br>of the churches and the churches themselves.
    <br>So, we were afraid that he was coming to South Africa to raise the churches
    <br>that were already under our kingdom.
    <br>Mr Lawrence Moala
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We were afraid that he was going to raise the pastors
    <br>that were already under our kingdom knowingly and some unknowingly.
    <br>We were afraid that he was coming to bring back that first power of light,
    <br>that first power they had in them.
    <br>So, we wanted them to be destroyed and be under our kingdom forever.
    <br>That was why we spread rumours and lies about him.
    <br>Not only that; we were told that we must kill two birds with one stone.
    <br>We were not only deceiving and destroying the pastors,
    <br>even the members themselves we were destroying, including their children.
    <br>We were attacking schools, especially universities.
    <br>We gave them these ribbons.
    <br>On this ribbon, it is written that,
    <br>'I will cut off witchcraft out of your hands (Micah 5:12)'.
    <br>So we came in the name of Jesus but we were not of Jesus Christ.
    <br>We had many students and gave some of them wallets.
    <br>Just by having a wallet that had the face of the dragon, the skull, with you,
    <br>you were automatically initiated because
    <br>if you take your money and put it in this wallet,
    <br>we had prayed over it.
    <br>In satanism, your money represents your blood.
    <br>Once you put your money in the wallet,
    <br>you are initiating yourself into our kingdom.
    <br>From there, we got you.
    <br>We had signs like the one you saw now.
    <br>This sign is the powerful sign in all departments of the satanic occult.
    <br>This sign, when we come into churches and show it,
    <br>as I saw myself showing it there,
    <br>this sign was the power of the eye.
    <br>When we show it, it is to attack your mind
    <br>so that your mind wouldn't understand what the man of God was teaching.
    <br>When we pushed the sign, the power of demons was capturing your mind,
    <br>bringing the spirit of confusion.
    <br>There was this sign; this sign was blocking blessings.
    <br>I tried it but it didn't work here; I was here to try it but it didn't work.
    <br>This sign was to stop, block the blessings of the Christians.
    <br>I tried it here but it failed because of the power of God,
    <br>the power of the Anointing Water and the Anointing Stickers and the light on you
    <br>because you've got a light that is covering you.
    <br>So, as I entered here, the time I was here to destroy the man of God,
    <br>I failed because what I saw was amazing.
    <br>You mentioned that you were given the mission specifically to try and destroy Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>One of the methods you used was to spread rumours.
    <br>What other ways did you try to attack?
    <br>Did you ever try to come spiritually to The Synagogue Church Of All Nations and what happened?
    <br>What attempts have you made to destroy this ministry and Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>Regarding this ministry, I tried for 17 years because I started in 1996,
    <br>when they told us about The SCOAN.
    <br>We came here spiritually. First, we sent demons and the demons were captured;
    <br>they didn't come back to us and we were asking ourselves what was going on.
    <br>We sent them many times through the king who was lucifer, at that time;
    <br>because now, my King is Jesus Christ. Hallelujah!
    <br>Mr Lawrence Moala
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>We came again to The SCOAN.
    <br>I still remember, one day, we came spiritually
    <br>because we had the power to come out of our bodies.
    <br>The demons themselves were going forward; we knew that our coming here was not a story
    <br>but it was a fire in the flesh. So, we came here spiritually.
    <br>When we came here, we found out that there were spirit beings outside
    <br>but we didn't see them as spirit beings, we saw them as lights
    <br>because they were closing their wings.
    <br>When we came near, the angels started to open their wings.
    <br>They opened their wings and their eyes,
    <br>they started to give the light and it blinded our spiritual eyes.
    <br>We had the power to see in the spirit but it blinded our spiritual eyes
    <br>and we had to go back to our bodies.
    <br>Another thing that I want to explain to the world is that when we went back to
    <br>our bodies, we were not able to enter at that time
    <br>because of the power that the angles used to blind our eyes.
    <br>When we got back to our bodies, it was difficult
    <br>because when you come out of your body, you don't just leave it like that;
    <br>you leave the demons called the seraphical camonics.
    <br>Those are the big demons in the satanic occult.
    <br>When you come out of your body, you do an exchange – they come in,
    <br>giving power by the pyramids in you; it is an exchange.
    <br>But when you come into the light and your eyes are blinded, you cannot enter
    <br>unless the light that has blinded you disappears
    <br> and then you are able to come inside again.
    <br>I remember one day, we had a meeting
    <br>that we'd better attack through the ushers and the helpers.
    <br>And we believed that we would be able to defeat them then
    <br>because in many churches, we used the helpers, ushers to destroy the churches.
    <br>We got most of them in their homes because in their homes,
    <br>they were arguing with their parents and the spirit of anger and stubbornness
    <br>and the short temper that they had opened the way for us to enter them.
    <br>We thought that when we came to The SCOAN, we would go through them
    <br>but we met with fire because when the evil spirits that entered them came here,
    <br>the man of God already had a plan -
    <br>he prayed for them before they started working.

    <br>The demons were captured, and we never saw them again.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We are learning many valuable lessons from our brother
    <br>and we understand that he and the kingdom he once belonged to, tried so many ways to come
    <br>both physically and spiritually here to The SCOAN in an attempt to destroy Prophet T.B Joshua.
    <br>But each attempt they made failed because of the superior power of God
    <br>and light of God in operation here.
    <br>Our brother also earlier mentioned specifically that he saw power in the items that came from The SCOAN;
    <br>the anointing water and the anointing sticker.
    <br>Just to build the faith of those present here, can you tell us from the spiritual perspective:
    <br>What can you say about the anointing water and anointing sticker that come from this ministry?
    <br>The 'spirit water' which was what we called it in the satanic occult
    <br>and they trained us that we must be aware of it and not get close to it.
    <br>We were told that, and we saw it with our spiritual eyes.
    <br>You, people of God, just see water.
    <br>For us, we saw blood – blood that was coming to us in floods of fire.
    <br>It is not just blood but blood in floods of fire.
    <br>That is why you hear most of the demons, when they come out, calling it fire
    <br>because it is blood in fire.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ for his wonderful deliverance.
    <br>Mr Lawrence Moala
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I've got a lot to say, a lot to share with you children of God
    <br>because I believe that God has delivered me not to sit down and hide what is happening.
    <br>I am totally delivered by the God of T.B. Joshua,
    <br>the right, anointed and appointed Prophet of God.
    <br>I believe in Jesus Christ with all of my heart, mind and spirit
    <br>and I believe in the Prophet T.B. Joshua with all of my mind, heart and spirit
    <br>because I saw him in the spirit and I see him again physically.
    <br>Glory be to God! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
