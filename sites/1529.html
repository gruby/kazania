    <br>Put your hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>Put your hands together for our wonderful Jesus!
    <br>The Restorer, the Deliverer, the Healer of our soul!
    <br>Put your hands together!
    <br>Thank Him!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Greet your neighbour, say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Good Morning to you all, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Yes, viewers all over the world, we greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, "Good Morning!"
    <br>You may be seated in the presence of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>Yes, indeed, 'Emmanuel' means, God is with us
    <br>as we can see in the Book of Matthew 1:23.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes, we have listened to testimonies -
    <br>life-changing testimonies that proved that the age of miracles is not yet past,
    <br>the Destiny Changer is still alive, His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Today He will change your destiny forever, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Today He will change your destiny, to the glory of God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Your coming here today is not by accident; it is by His divine appointment
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are in the presence of God to reset our belief
    <br>because what can restrict anyone from receiving is not on the outside but on the inside.
    <br>For the things that keep man from despairing,
    <br>from being downcast, are not what we see but what we believe.
    <br>It is true we all desire breakthrough, good health, the good life
    <br>but don't forget, it is not your mere wishful thinking that will bring your ambition to reality
    <br>but your rightful thinking with rightful focus.
    <br>We all desire good health, breakthrough, success in life
    <br>but don't forget, it is not your mere wishful thinking that will bring about the good dreams you desire
    <br>but rightful thinking with rightful focus.
    <br>You may have experienced so many setbacks and of course, these are unavoidable.
    <br>You may have experienced so much pain
    <br>and you have become immune to the injuries of setbacks.
    <br>You may have experienced so much pain.
    <br>You may have not experienced happiness, joy for a very long time.
    <br>Failure may have caused you hunger.
    <br>I am here to tell you this morning there is something far more important than your situation
    <br>and that is your goal and your dream.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is a high time for you to set out on a journey of a comeback.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>This is a time for me to set out on a journey of a comeback.
    <br>We have two categories of people and I want you to listen:
    <br>Those who choose not to let their setbacks,
    <br>their failure, their challenges overwhelm or overtake them
    <br>and those who choose to wallow in their self-pity, claiming that life is unfair to them.
    <br>They choose to think and talk like suspects and not as prospects.
    <br>These people choose to think and talk as victims and not as victors.
    <br>Though they have dreams and goals, they do not know how to draw up a great plan,
    <br>making it difficult for them to scale over life's obstacles.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know Prophet T.B. Joshua says and I quote:
    <br>"Failure is not falling short of our goal in life; failure is simply not making an effort."
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing - I may not know your situation but Jesus knows -
    <br>whatever challenges you may be passing through, I want you to know that it is not a full stop
    <br>but a comma in the sentence of life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Those challenges, pain, rejection, setback, disappointment
    <br>are never the end of the road.
    <br>It is not a full stop but a comma in the sentence of life.
    <br>This will bring me to the title of this message:
    <br>YOUR SETBACK IS FOR YOUR COMEBACK
    <br>I tell you,
    <br>YOUR SETBACK IS FOR YOUR COMEBACK
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My setback...
    <br>I want you to say it as if you mean it.
    <br>My setback is for my comeback.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You may have experienced so much intimidation, isolation, false accusation -
    <br>this is your moment of comeback, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You may have been sacked wrongly, you may have been accused wrongly,
    <br>you may have been denied of your rights.
    <br>This is your moment of comeback, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the Book of Luke 5, when you read the story of Simon Peter at the seaside,
    <br>the Bible makes us understand that despite being an experienced fisherman,
    <br>he struggled with failure, setback.
    <br>Today, fear of failure has robbed many from reaching their goal in life
    <br>when they remember the failure of yesterday.
    <br>Many have allowed the fear of failure to rob them of their productivity and the joy of life,
    <br>failing to realise that your challenge is a tonic to your success in life.
    <br>Many have allowed their setback, their challenges to rob them
    <br>of their productivity and the joy of life,
    <br>failing to discover that their challenge is a tonic to their success in life.
    <br>How many of us want to be successful in life?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ask any successful person and they will tell you that successful people don't just drift to the top;
    <br>they engage in focused action, personal discipline
    <br>and lots and lots of energy to make things happen every day.
    <br>Life is full of possibilities but you can only reach them with the rightful focus.
    <br>Let us open our Bibles to the Book of Luke 5 and that will be our first proof text
    <br>and let us hear that gospel truth that brought Simon Peter out of his desperate setback.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>My setback is for my comeback.
    <br>Let's open our Bibles to the Book of Luke 5 and we read quickly from verse 3.
    <br>Now Jesus...
    <br>"Then He got into one of the boats which was Simon's
    <br>and asked him to put out a little from the land.
    <br>And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.
    <br>When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, 'Launch out into the deep
    <br>and let down your nets for a catch'."
    <br>Let's listen to this verse 5.
    <br>"But Simon answered and said to Him, 'Master, we have toiled all night
    <br>and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net'.
    <br>And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish,
    <br>and their net was breaking."
    <br>Now, what do we learn from this?
    <br>The Bible makes us understand how difficult it was for Simon Peter
    <br>to avoid the trap of looking back as he confessed his failure.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you read that verse 5, you will see how he was confessing his failure
    <br>because he found it so difficult to avoid the trap of looking back.
    <br>But when he met Jesus, he realised there was something on the inside which he needed to overcome.
    <br>Having identified this, he overcame it with the rightful focus.
    <br>We are in the presence of God, waiting expectantly to receive from Jesus
    <br>but you must identify that thing on the inside of you which you need to overcome
    <br>in order to reach Jesus.
    <br>When he met Jesus, the Bible says he realised there was something
    <br>on the inside of him which he needed to overcome.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Having identified the thing, he overcame it with the rightful focus
    <br>and he experienced a radical transformation.
    <br>As he spread his nets on the water, the Bible says,
    <br>his disappointment became a stepping stone to his breakthrough.
    <br>Let someone say
    <br>My setback is a stepping stone to my breakthrough.
    <br>My sickness is a stepping stone to my good health.
    <br>The problem we are facing is that we oftentimes listen to the voice of our situation
    <br>because our situation talks - it talks fear.
    <br>The voice of situation says," You are not good enough. You are not smart enough.
    <br>You are not brilliant enough. You don't deserve to live.
    <br>How will you be healed?"
    <br>Remember what the doctor says about your health, that it is incurable.
    <br>These are the voices of our situation because they talk fear.
    <br>But I am here today to tell you,
    <br>any time satan reminds you of your past failure, remind him of his future failure.
    <br>Any time he speaks to your mind with your weakness,
    <br>your limitation, your shortcomings,
    <br>any time he reminds you of your past failure, do not hesitate to remind him of his future failure.
    <br>Champions are not crowned for desiring to be champions;
    <br>they are crowned because they have defeated their enemies.
    <br>If you see champions with gold medals, ask them and they will tell you.
    <br>Now suppose you are in a battle field, and face to face with your giant,
    <br>just imagine, if you are not with your right mind,
    <br>if you cannot overcome the battle, you will succumb to the battle.
    <br>Our major enemy here is that monster called fear.
    <br>But I tell you today,
    <br>the Holy Spirit will defeat that fear for you, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>because you are already in the presence of God.
    <br>The only thing that you need to work with is that fear,
    <br>speaking to your mind, telling you it is impossible,
    <br>you are not smart enough, you are not good enough -
    <br>this monster called fear.
    <br>Today, the Holy Spirit will defeat that fear for you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>However, you have a role to play.
    <br>You have a role to play.
    <br>One thing is sure: That enemy needs to be eliminated with the rightful mindset.
    <br>Therefore, mind management is the first priority for an overcomer.
    <br>We all want to win, we all want to be successful, we want to have everything we need.
    <br>God has prepared a table but we have a role to play.
    <br>Mind management is the first priority for an overcomer.
    <br>Life is like an onion. We all know onion. You know onion.
    <br>Life is like an onion that we have to peel one layer at a time.
    <br>If you consider the discomfort while peeling the onion, you might lose the core value.
    <br>If you consider the discomfort while peeling the onion, you might probably lose its great benefit as well.
    <br>We all know the essential benefit of onions to our health.
    <br>If you consider the pain that you encounter while peeling the onion,
    <br>you will lose every benefit that it entails to your life.
    <br>Brethren, sometimes we need to listen to some hero's setback and comeback
    <br>so that we can hold onto our faith, our hope in Christ Jesus.
    <br>And any time I think about that, I always remember Joseph: he is man like anyone of us.
    <br>In the Book of Genesis 40, the Bible makes us understand that
    <br>when Joseph was knocked down by false accusation, setback, humiliation,
    <br>he realised that if only he could look up, then he would get up.
    <br>When you are knocked down by false accusation, setback,
    <br>how often do you look up in order to get up?
    <br>Sometimes when we remember the failure of yesterday, it gives us a hard time in forging ahead.
    <br>So therefore, any time you are tired, brethren, of your cheap shots and battles -
    <br>remember Joseph: He was a man who refused to submit to the pressures of life,
    <br>a man who refused to wallow in self-pity
    <br>but rather took advantage of the life in the prison to create the life he desired.
    <br>The Bible says Joseph maintained a rightful focus even behind bars.
    <br>His diligence and positive attitude led him to the throne.
    <br>What is your situation this morning?
    <br>Are you facing seemingly hopeless predicament at work,
    <br>at school, at the office, in your marriage?
    <br>Follow Joseph's example by using your predicament to reverse
    <br>the overwhelming odds around you.
    <br>If God could do it for Joseph, He can do it for any one of us.
    <br>Whatever the predicaments, challenges you might be facing,
    <br>use your predicament to reverse overwhelming odds around you.
    <br>Remember, Jesus Christ is the only One who never leaves anyone behind
    <br>Trust Him and you will never be confounded in time or eternity.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, those who are under the influence of this telecast,
    <br>the secret of your comeback is hidden in your daily routine.
    <br>God will maintain your energy for the distance
    <br>if only you are ready to start seeing your challenges as a comma and not a full stop.
    <br>Planning is the starting point for any dream or goal in life,
    <br>as God honours men who plan.
    <br>Right now I want you to bow down your head and say,
    <br>Oh Lord, in Your mercy and in Your favour,
    <br>give me the ability to plan in the midst of my challenge, situations.
    <br>Just begin to ask God to give you that grace.
    <br>Ask Him to give you the ability to plan in the midst of your challenge
    <br>in the midst of your setback, in the midst of your failure.
    <br>Ask Him to give you the enablement, wisdom, knowledge
    <br>and understanding in ordering your daily routine, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Brethren, when everything around you looks so bad,
    <br>when everything goes wrong in your life, don't go wrong with them.
    <br>Many today committed suicide when they gave up on life.
    <br>Many became smokers and drunkards and they said because I was sacked, of course I am depressed.
    <br>Some go into crying and other forms of immorality.
    <br>Many see failure as a full stop to life, instead of a comma.
    <br>Indeed, challenges that we face on a daily basis are never a full stop but they are commas.
    <br>It is never the end of the road.
    <br>That you are disappointed today does not mean you cannot win tomorrow.
    <br>Your enemy today may be your best friend tomorrow.
    <br>Brethren, if you keep failing in life,
    <br>if you can change the way you think, you can change your life.
    <br>If you keep struggling with issues in life, if you can change the way you think,
    <br>you can change your life because mind management is the first priority for an overcomer.
    <br>Use this message to start in you a comeback to a place you have lost for a period of time.
    <br>Let this message start in you a comeback to a place you have lost for a short period of time.
    <br>Let's open our Bibles finally to the Book of Ephesians 2
    <br>and let us hear the words of Apostle Paul that will gladen your heart.
    <br>Turn with me quickly to the Book of Ephesians 2.
    <br>We take our reading from verse 10.
    <br>"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works,
    <br>which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."
    <br>The Bible reaffirms here that whatever situation we may be facing,
    <br>we are a work of art, wonderfully made as a successful person and not a failure.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No matter my situation, no matter my failure,
    <br>no matter the setback, I am a work of art,
    <br>wonderfully made as a successful person and not a failure.
    <br>Now, it is your turn to transfer that success to your life, brethren.
    <br>It is high time for you to transfer that success to your life
    <br>by meditating upon it, confessing it and acting on it.
    <br>Remember, it is not all up to God; certainly it is not all up to you.
    <br>It takes both God's ability and your genuine willingness
    <br>to bring about your dream and your goal.
    <br>To protect your dream, you need to stop the language
    <br>or the vocabulary of a victim, suspect.
    <br>Be positive.
    <br>Let your words become the photograph of the future you desire and not the future you fear.
    <br>Rightful focus comes when, by an act of faith, you begin to think, talk
    <br>not of your sin or your shortcomings but of your righteousness in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Rightful focus comes when, by an act of faith, you begin to think, talk
    <br>not of your sin or your shortcomings but of your righteousness in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>You can conquer your setback by focusing on your comeback.
    <br>You can conquer your sickness by focusing on your good health.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is time for us to stop looking at where you are coming from
    <br>and start focusing on where you are going.
    <br>We are all coming from disappointment, setback, failure, hardship, sickness, poverty.
    <br>It is time to stop looking at where you are coming from
    <br>and focus on where you are going because your focus is your personal decision.
    <br>Rightful focus establishes a deep sense of intimacy with God.
    <br>Success is not about our weaknesses, our faults, or pitfalls;
    <br>it is about what Jesus did on the Cross of Calvary for us.
    <br>Choose today to let the One who created you assist you in all you do.
    <br>But don't forget you have a role to play.
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of your heart.
    <br>Let someone say, "This is my comeback!"
    <br>This is my comeback!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
