    <br>As the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua moved along the rows at the Monday Live Prophetic Service,
    <br>he prays for visitors from other countries,
    <br>breaking generational curses and rewriting family histories, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>During the prayer this lady cried out, bringing her complaint to the man of God.
    <br>I am stranded; I am from South Africa.
    <br>I don't have money for the ticket to go back.
    <br>- You are now roaming about.
    <br>- I'm roaming about.
    <br>The question the Holy Spirit is asking you:
    <br>You left South Africa purposely and you got a visa to which country? Not Nigeria.
    <br>- To where?
    <br>- To Ghana.
    <br>I went with my boyfriend to Ghana but then he dumped me there
    <br>so, I came here to find a way because there is no one to help me.
    <br>What happened in Ghana?
    <br>He left me because we didn't have money.
    <br>Why did he leave you?
    <br>He was having a girlfriend so he just left me.
    <br>You left South Africa because you wanted to marry him.
    <br>Yes, I thought he would marry me and we'd do business there.
    <br>Please!
    <br>You left South Africa because you wanted a traditional introduction.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What happened in Ghana?
    <br>I got stranded; I was staying in a hotel and tried calling his phone but...
    <br>We stayed there for two years and were living in another house.
    <br>He couldn't pay the money so he left me and told me he didn't have money.
    <br>Why are you talking as if you came from South Africa to Nigeria?
    <br>I wanted to explain because...
    <br>I came to Ghana - from Ghana I came here...
    <br>You are not accepting your wrong; you are a bad girl.
    <br>You know you are a bad girl?
    <br>You know that?
    <br>You know you are a bad girl?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Until you accept your wrong and you accept that you are a bad girl...
    <br>Yes, I'm bad.
    <br>You are the people that are spoiling the name of your country.
    <br>You have not mentioned the reason why you people separated.
    <br>Your father has not given you consent to marry the boy.
    <br>You have not done the proper thing; you left your home,
    <br>you followed men and disappointed your parents.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Woman Tries To TRICK T.B. Joshua...
    <br>Now, she has realised her mistake.
    <br>She just wanted to collect money from man of God.
    <br>"Man of God, I am stranded; I am roaming about the streets. I need money to go back."
    <br>So, man of God will give you money.
    <br>You know he is a man of God and must know who you are.
    <br>What a beautiful lady!
    <br>What is your problem?
    <br>You are forcing yourself on a man instead of the man to be looking for you.
    <br>Opposite is the case.
    <br>My mother is sick because of me.
    <br>Your mother is sick because of you.
    <br>Yes, because of me.
    <br>Because they are looking for you.
    <br>Woman Tries To TRICK T.B. Joshua...
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Zama Mkhwanazi, I'm from South Africa.
    <br>During the service on Monday, I cried out to the man of God.
    <br>I told him that I was stranded.
    <br>He prophesied that I was a bad girl.
    <br>I just left my country without telling my parents and it's true.
    <br>It all started in South Africa.
    <br>I didn't tell my parents where I was going.
    <br>I just lied to them.
    <br>I'm a graduate.
    <br>I have a degree in Criminology.
    <br>So, I met this guy.
    <br>He promised me that we would come to Ghana and he would give me money.
    <br>I ran away with him and I told my parents I was working and I would send them money every month.
    <br>He took me to Ghana and when we arrived there, I logged in a hotel for two years.
    <br>He would come and see me during the night.
    <br>I kept believing that one day he would give me money as he promised me in South Africa.
    <br>He was beating me.
    <br>We were always quarrelling.
    <br>He told me that I was a bad luck girl.
    <br>Since he met me, there was just disappointment and things were not going well in his life.
    <br>So, he left me and then I was stranded.
    <br>I didn't know what to do; I was going from man to man, sleeping on the streets.
    <br>I didn't know what to do.
    <br>I was in Ghana.
    <br>I heard about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I didn't have money to come here but the passengers in the station in Ghana helped me to come here.
    <br>When I came here, I was drunk because every time I wanted to overcome my problems,
    <br>I would have to be drunk so that I could be confident and face people.
    <br>So I came here on Sunday and I was drunk.
    <br>I was fighting with the ushers and I was drunk.
    <br>I really wanted to see the man of God.
    <br>Even my embassy did not help me with anything.
    <br>They called my people but they said they did not have money.
    <br>On Monday, I came and cried to the man of God.
    <br>There's one thing that I'm asking the man of God to help me with.
    <br>I am disturbed psychologically.
    <br>I can't face people anymore.
    <br>For two years I was indoors.
    <br>I can't go out, I don't see the light.
    <br>I go out at 12am in the night.
    <br>I don't want to see anybody.
    <br>I'm shaking, I'm panicking.
    <br>Even with my degree, I don't know where to start to apply.
    <br>I don't have any vision or dream anymore.
    <br>I don't know what is happening with my life.
    <br>Please, deliver me.
    <br>Your parents are looking for you everywhere.
    <br>You are spoiling the name of your country and your family.
    <br>We are going to give her a ticket, money, she will go back.
    <br>At the same time I want to speak to her parents;
    <br>they have to take care of her and forgive her.
    <br>She has learned from her mistakes.
    <br>She is not only going to be delivered,
    <br>the ministry is also interested in what she will be doing when she goes back to South Africa.
    <br>If we just deliver her and ask her to go back, she will still fall back
    <br>because of economic meltdown.
    <br>She needs to be restored - complete restoration.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Zama, I'm from South Africa.
    <br>I came here to thank God for my deliverance.
    <br>I have been delivered from the spirit of drinking and idols.
    <br>It destroyed my life, I couldn't do anything.
    <br>I was indoors for two years. I didn't see people.
    <br>I was lazy and would just sleep.
    <br>I couldn't do any work that a woman is supposed to do.
    <br>I would just go out in the evening and talk alone and sit in the bush.
    <br>I didn't care about my future.
    <br>I'm the first born in my family; they were all depending on me but I didn't care.
    <br>I didn't care about anything except to eat and sleep.
    <br>I couldn't wash for myself or even go and do my hair.
    <br>I thank God that I'm delivered.
    <br>I feel like something has come out of my brain.
    <br>I feel confident again.
    <br>Can you see the reason why God brought her here? - To be delivered.
    <br>It was not even the issue of ticket;
    <br>money for ticket is nothing - anybody can give the money for ticket,
    <br>anybody can give her money to establish her somewhere,
    <br>but to deliver her, that is the main reason.
    <br>And I want to believe she will value her deliverance because she passed through things.
    <br>She will be given a ticket to go back to her country.
    <br>She will come back in the nearest future to share her testimony with you.
    <br>OK?
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>She should also be given $2,000 to go back to her country.
    <br>Zama, once a bad girl, realised her mistake.
    <br>Stranded with no money to return home after her deliverance,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua bought her an air ticket to return home to her parents in South Africa,
    <br>whom she had run away from two years ago.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua also gave her the sum of $2,000 to assist her in making a fresh start in life.
    <br>Her past now over and her bag packed, Zama is ready to go
    <br>and she looks forward to a new lease of life, a new future, a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Let's hear from her.
    <br>My name is Zama Mkhwanazi, I'm from South Africa.
    <br>I have not been back to South Africa for two years.
    <br>He (T.B. Joshua) prophesied that I was a bad girl; I'd disappointed my parents.
    <br>It is true.
    <br>The man of God promised to buy me a ticket
    <br>and give me money for a business - to start something.
    <br>Not only that - I was also delivered.
    <br>Now, I have a ticket and the man of God also gave me $2,000
    <br>to go and start something in South Africa.
    <br>I'm blessed!
    <br>Blessed indeed.
    <br>She digs her hand into the bag and pulls out the $2,000 and air ticket.
    <br>I'm so happy that I'm going back to my parents; for two years I've not seen them.
    <br>I'm so happy. I want to thank the man of God for rescuing my life.
    <br>I was almost a dead person but now, I'm OK; I'm delivered and free.
    <br>When God is involved in your matter, your matter is settled.
    <br>This is a far cry from someone who was once roaming about on the street, living an aimless life.
    <br>Jesus Christ can change anyone, anytime, anywhere; yes, even Zama.
    <br>Glory be to God - her history has been rewritten, her story has changed.
    <br>You rescued me, Lord Jesus Christ, from this piece of hell!
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>I will see you again in the future!
    <br>I promise I will make you proud, God proud and my parents proud!
    <br>I thank you so much!
    <br>Grateful to God for rescuing her from what she referred to as a 'piece of hell',
    <br>Zama has made life's biggest decision to serve Jesus Christ.
