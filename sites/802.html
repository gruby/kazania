    <br>Amazing grace how sweet the sound
    <br>That saved a wretch like me
    <br>I once was lost but now I'm found
    <br>Was blind but now I see
    <br>It was grace that taught my heart to fear
    <br>And grace my fears relieved
    <br>How precious did that grace appear
    <br>The hour I first believed
    <br>My chains are gone I've been set free
    <br>My God my Saviour has ransomed me
    <br>And like a flood His mercy reigns
    <br>Unending love amazing grace
    <br>Amazing grace how sweet the sound
    <br>That saved a wretch like me
    <br>I once was lost but now I'm found
    <br>Was blind but now I see
    <br>Amazing grace how sweet the sound
    <br>That saved a wretch like me
    <br>I once was lost but now I'm found
    <br>Was blind but now I see
    <br>My chains are gone I've been set free
    <br>My God my Saviour has ransomed me
    <br>And like a flood His mercy reigns
    <br>Unending love amazing grace
    <br>My chains are gone I've been set free

    <br>And like a flood His mercy reigns
    <br>Unending love amazing grace
    <br>Put your hands together for the amazing Christ.
    <br>Today, let's usher ourselves; let's look at the book of Jeremiah.
    <br>Jeremiah 31, let me take verse 34.
    <br>"No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord',
    <br>because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord,
    <br>for I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”
    <br>This is what the Lord says.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>That verse 34; it is all about forgiveness.
    <br>FORGIVENESS AND UNFORGIVENESS
    <br>Forgiveness – you don’t give; you don't get.
    <br>That is all about forgiveness.
    <br>Forgiveness – you don’t give; you don't get.
    <br>You don’t give; you don't receive.
    <br>That is all about forgiveness.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Forgiveness – you don’t give; you don't get.
    <br>I mean, you don’t give; you don't receive.
    <br>You have a full detail about forgiveness in the Book of Mark 11 from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>Mark 11:1-end
    <br>About FORGIVENESS AND UNFORGIVENESS
    <br>What we have seen today is all about - you don't give; you don't receive.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[You don’t give; you don't receive.]
    <br>What you give is what you receive.
    <br>[What you give is what you receive.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[What you give is what you receive.]
    <br>If you give what you don’t need, you will receive what you don’t need.
    <br>If you give what your life depends on – what you cherish most,
    <br>you will receive what your life depends on – what you cherish most.
    <br>There are many material things we don't need.
    <br>You pretend to forgive...
    <br>There are things that you don't need, or you give your waste time, time you don't need.
    <br>Look at yourself here today.
    <br>It is not that this time is very important to you.
    <br>You are here because there is no other business out there, and nothing functions today.
    <br>You cannot cash money in the bank, there is nothing...
    <br>You are here as if you are giving God your best time.
    <br>What you give is what you receive.
    <br>If you give what you don't need; the material in your store, used tire...
    <br>Those tires that you know could lead to a death - and you are giving it to your neighbour.
    <br>Your neighbour needs a tire and you give him a tire - you are setting a trap for your neighbour.
    <br>You are about to kill your neighbour.
    <br>Many people died because of that.
    <br>You might have killed many people which you don't know - indirectly.
    <br>You say that you are not a murderer.
    <br>Who told that you are not a murderer?
    <br>What about those used tires you gave your friend in the past?
    <br>You heard that your friend had an accident...
    <br>It was the cause of the death.
    <br>Many Christians today are victims of the trap of unforgiveness.
    <br>Many of us have never felt the presence of God.
    <br>You just use an idea.
    <br>You don't know what it means to feel the presence of God.
    <br>How does He see people?
    <br>Does He shake people like this?
    <br>How?
    <br>Many have never felt the presence of God due to years of holding unforgiveness.
    <br>Due to what?
    <br>Years of what?
    <br>... of holding unforgiveness.
    <br>You are holding grief, grudges, pain of the past, bitterness, resentment in your heart
    <br>and you are expecting to feel the presence of God.
    <br>I am just telling you the reason why you don't know who God is.
    <br>You only read that God is good, nice, He is Saviour,  Healer, Deliverer...
    <br>But to have Him - it is a different thing.
    <br>Many have never felt the presence of God due to years of holding unforgiveness.
    <br>Pain of the past, strife, claiming you are right;
    <br>you don’t know that unforgiving spirit will put you in the dark, outside God.
    <br>Whether you are right or wrong, you have no right to hold pain.
    <br>Unforgiveness because of relations, friends, people that died, or that are alive...
    <br>Holding unforgiveness towards dead, alive, relatives, friends
    <br>and you are expecting to feel the presence of God...
    <br>God is looking for a free spirit.
    <br>You are not free.
    <br>You are not available.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You are not free.
    <br>You are not available".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[You are not free.
    <br>You are not available.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[You are not free.
    <br>You are not available.]
    <br>Again.
    <br>[You are not free.
    <br>You are not available.]
    <br>You are not free.
    <br>You are not available.
    <br>If you should go into your heart, a lot is there - there is a conflict between faith and doubt,
    <br>love and hatred, good and bad.
    <br>Conflicts are going on.
    <br>You are not free.
    <br>You have to settle your account.
    <br>You must have a free spirit to attract the Spirit of God.
    <br>You are not free.
    <br>That is why you have never felt the presence of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Someone may have done a horrible thing to you.
    <br>For you to receive God, you must forgive.
    <br>You must forgive.
    <br>Someone may have done horrible things to offend you.
    <br>For you to receive God, you must forgive.
    <br>The question: How will I forgive?
    <br>You must first learn to forgive yourself.
    <br>Then, you can forgive others.
    <br>What you don’t have, you cannot give.
    <br>You can only give out what you have and you cannot give all you have.
    <br>Forgive yourself; then, forgive others.
    <br>Because everybody hurts somewhere.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Everybody hurts somewhere."
    <br>You must give them another chance.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Everybody hurts somewhere.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You must give them another chance.
    <br>Because you are given another chance, that is why you are here today.
    <br>You are given another chance; that is why you are able to sit, talk and laugh freely.
    <br>There are many people who, right now, cannot walk freely.
    <br>They want to be here but could not.
    <br>You walk, talk, sit and hear, freely.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many who are better than you, who live right better than you, are in the graveyard.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In terms of "living right", when we compare them to you, and you say you live right and you are an obedient child,
    <br>they are more obedient than you - but yet they are at the graveyard.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Their dream hit the rock of disappointment.
    <br>Here you are
    <br>looking freely, sitting freely, talking freely.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Give them another chance.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Give them another chance.]
    <br>Your accusers – give them another chance.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Give them another chance.
    <br>Your offenders – give them another chance.
    <br>Your enemies – give them another chance.
    <br>Jesus never disconnected from those who had made mistakes with their lives.
    <br>Give them another chance.
    <br>Don’t forget where we are coming from.
    <br>You don’t give; you don’t get.
    <br>What you give is what you get.
    <br>If you give useless things – what you do not need, you will continue to receive what you don’t need.
    <br>You have been giving your waste time, time you don't need.
    <br>When you want to visit your friends, you make sure you have no other commitments before going there.
    <br>You only want to pray when you are in need of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sunday service - your government made it possible for you to be free so that you can come.
    <br>It is like you have been encouraged to worship God.
    <br>You should stop to be encouraged to worship God, you should worship God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Stop being encouraged - worship God".
    <br>You have been encouraged to worship God, that is why they have given you a day for worship - Sunday.
    <br>Your government, your authority is encouraging you to worship God,
    <br>that is why you are given a free day to come to church.
    <br>That should not be the salvation of your soul.
    <br>The salvation of your soul – you should worship God with all your heart, with all your soul.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>After today you will not worship or read your Bible until next Sunday.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The way you have been giving to God is the way you have been receiving from Him.
    <br>There are many areas in the Bible you have never read in your life.
    <br>You only look for a healing and blessing portion - psalm 35.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What you give is what you get.
    <br>So, forgiveness – what you give is what you get.
    <br>“I forgive you” – do you really mean it with all your heart?
    <br>"I forgive you."
    <br>Do you really mean it with all your heart or you say this for selfish, classic and material reasons?
    <br>What you give is what you get.
    <br>Look at your dress, how you look like.
    <br>You have a special dress somewhere, which you normally wear for festivals, special occasions,
    <br>weddings...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When it is time for thanksgiving, you bring change you received at the petrol station.
    <br>What you give is what you get.
    <br>You give change; you receive change.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Forgiveness.
    <br>You give change you received somewhere and you will receive change in return.
    <br>This is why what you have been receiving has not been satisfying you.
    <br>What you give to your friend is what you get from your friend.
    <br>What you give to your wife is what you get from your wife.
    <br>What you give to your husband is what you get from your husband.
    <br>What you give to your God is what you get from your God.
    <br>When we talk of giving, I am talking of forgiveness.
    <br>I’m talking of material and immaterial needs.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your time
    <br>When you give time that you don't need for an occasion.
    <br>When you study, the reward of that occasion...
    <br>Maybe you want to visit a friend and you check other commitments.
    <br>You go to visit your friend if there aren't any other commitments.
    <br>When you look at that relationship - the outcome of that relationship is according to
    <br>"what you give; you receive".
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Take this word.
    <br>When you take this word, you will capture this all.
    <br>Like I have said, "Forgiveness and unforgiving spirit".
    <br>You will read the full detail in the book of Mark 11.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Regard God.
    <br>Regard God with your time.
    <br>Regard Him with your strength.
