    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There is a lady - you hear a voice.
    <br>And this voice would ask you to begin to look for a leaf, to look for different things together.
    <br>I don't know whether you want to be a native doctor.
    <br>So, please come out.
    <br>In confirmation of the prophecy, a young lady comes forward from the crowd,
    <br>accompanied by her father.
    <br>My name is Omijie Helen, I am from Edo State.
    <br>The man of God prophesied that there was a lady there -
    <br>she used to hear an evil voice telling her to select different types of leaves to make a charm.
    <br>I am the one.
    <br>My name is Omijie Saturday.
    <br>The person beside me is my daughter, Helen Omijie.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave to my daughter is one hundred percent true.
    <br>The man of God said she normally hears a voice telling her to go outside to the bush
    <br>and pick some leaves.
    <br>It is one hundred percent true.
    <br>I caught her in her room with a rubber pot,
    <br>putting sand and leaves gathered together with a red cloth.
    <br>She wanted to kill her elder brother.
    <br>When she was saying incantations, I rushed and carried the pot to my room and untied it.
    <br>I even came with the rubber pot and everything; I kept it outside.
    <br>OK, so sister, can you go and bring that pot from where you left it?
    <br>To further confirm the prophetic message of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>she proceeds outside to collect the pot,
    <br>that she and her father hid before entering the church.
    <br>Look at your screen.
    <br>That is exactly what the man of God prophesied about
    <br>and the lady confirmed that she came with the pot and the leaves.
    <br>That is what the evil voice in her has been telling her to do, to plot these leaves,
    <br>make it a charm and to destroy people.
    <br>You can see her coming right now, with the pot she picked from outside,
    <br>and that is the very evil pot she has been using to destroy people.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Omijie Helen.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my father.
    <br>I am from Edo State.
    <br>Last Sunday, the man of God prophesied that there was a lady who hears a voice
    <br>telling her to cut leaves to make a charm.
    <br>I am the one; I confirmed it to be true.
    <br>Before now, I used to have nightmares and see snakes in my dream.
    <br>There was a day I sat in front of my house - there is a bush around the house.
    <br>The spirit told me, "Go," so I stood up and moved close to the bush.
    <br>The evil spirit told me to pick - I was gathering the leaves.
    <br>The spirit told me to look for a bowl to pour sand inside,
    <br>and a red cloth to tie the leaves together.
    <br>After tying the leaves, I put them in the middle of the sand and poured water around them.
    <br>One day, one of my neighbours offended me.
    <br>She said she saw me one day with one of the thugs in my area,
    <br>and said she was going to report me to my dad.
    <br>I told her to report me, that she was free to do so.
    <br>That very day, I went home and the evil spirit told me to make the same charm for her.
    <br>The evil spirit spoke to me through my heart;
    <br>it told me, "Go," so I had to carry the bowl and pour new sand into it.
    <br>I had thrown away the one I used before,
    <br>so I looked for a bowl to pour the sand in, gathering the leaves again
    <br>and tied them with a red cloth.
    <br>I put them in the middle of the plate and poured water around them.
    <br>When I was speaking to the charm,
    <br>I said I wanted her to lose her memory whenever she saw my father.
    <br>One day, I was sitting in front of my house and she passed by.
    <br>I noticed that the woman did not say anything.
    <br>The evil spirit was telling me, "Don't worry. I am here for you.
    <br>She cannot remember anything."
    <br>Since then, the spirit had been telling me different things to do.
    <br>There was a day my brother offended me,
    <br>so the spirit told me to go out to pick the leaves again.
    <br>I went out to pick the leaves and gathered them together.
    <br>I used them to make a charm for him that whatever he laid his hands on would never prosper.
    <br>This is what I did to him.
    <br>Last month, my brother offended me again.
    <br>The spirit told me to take the pot which I kept inside my room.
    <br>I went to my room to take the pot.
    <br>I picked up the pot and held it in my hands.
    <br>As I was about to talk to the charm,
    <br>my dad ran into my room and collected it from me.
    <br>OK, the first time your brother offended you and you cursed him with that charm;
    <br>tell us began to happen, what you noticed about him.
    <br>He started misbehaving and was rude to my father.
    <br>Sometimes, he would lie to my father that he wanted to buy books or something else,
    <br>and I noticed that he was not buying anything;
    <br>he just wanted to collect the money to use it anyhow.
    <br>He is not doing well.
    <br>That's how it happened.
    <br>Last week Sunday, my dad told me that we would be going to church.
    <br>The evil spirit was telling me, "Stay at home! What do you want to go and do in church?"
    <br>My dad said whether we liked it or not, all of us must go to church,
    <br>so he brought me to the church.
    <br>But I did not know my dad had brought the charm with him.
    <br>You mean you didn't know that your dad carried the charm?
    <br>No.
    <br>- And when he came, he hid it somewhere?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Tell us, after your deliverance last Sunday,
    <br>what are the changes you have noticed in your life.
    <br>After my deliverance, I came here on Monday for the Living Water service.
    <br>After drinking the Living Water,
    <br>I felt a heavy thing in my heart which was too heavy for me to carry.
    <br>Then, I went back to my seat at the back.
    <br>In the evening, the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>Later, I felt that the heaviness in my heart had gone.
    <br>I felt like urinating but I decided to hold it.
    <br>When I got home the next day, I felt like urinating.
    <br>I went to the toilet and urinated blood.
    <br>I was looking and asked myself, "Where is the blood coming from?"
    <br>- After the Living Water service, the next day?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>You urinated blood?
    <br>And after that time?
    <br>Since that time, I greet my dad and behave normally.
    <br>- So now you are completely free?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My name is Saturday Omijie.
    <br>The person standing beside me is my daughter, Helen Omijie.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave last week concerning my daughter
    <br>is one hundred percent true.
    <br>He said there was a lady there who normally heard a voice
    <br>telling her to go out and pick leaves to put inside a pot and make a charm.
    <br>He said he wondered whether she wanted to become a native doctor.
    <br>It is one hundred percent true!
    <br>The spirit had been tormenting my daughter.
    <br>Sometimes, she would shout at night and I would run from my room to her room.
    <br>As a mortal man, I could not see what was disturbing her.
    <br>She would be shouting and rolling on the floor.
    <br>Every night, it continued to disturb her.
    <br>She had turned me to a runner at home.
    <br>The spirit had made her not to respect anybody.
    <br>I could pass in front of her and she would not greet me.
    <br>She would not even notice me.
    <br>She was very stubborn and angry.
    <br>Three weeks ago, I just went to her room; what I saw was very terrible.
    <br>I saw her with a pot of charms; she was making incantations.
    <br>When I saw her, she was wild as an elephant.
    <br>My focus was to rush to collect the pot from her before anything happened.
    <br>When I asked her, "What is this thing for?"
    <br>She said she wanted to kill her elder brother.
    <br>I tore the leaves and took the charm to my room.
    <br>That very day, my son came to me to ask what the problem was.
    <br>I explained the situation to him and what his sister was doing.
    <br>He did not believe me; he thought she was just naturally stubborn.
    <br>I said, "No."
    <br>I said, "Today will be the last day for this spirit to torment this house."
    <br>I told her that she would not enter the year, 2020, with this evil spirit.
    <br>Last week, I said, "We are going to The SCOAN."
    <br>She said that she was not going to The SCOAN.
    <br>She said the spirit told her that she would not go to The SCOAN.
    <br>It took me a lot of time and effort to bring her last Sunday.
    <br>Thank God for everything!
    <br>Since that Sunday, she has been behaving very well.
    <br>Now, she greets me and cooks, unlike before.
    <br>She did not cook.
    <br>I would come back from work and cook for her.
    <br>Now, she cooks, respects everyone and greets.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My advise goes to parents.
    <br>They should be very watchful and check on their children to know what they are doing in secret
    <br>because we don't know what they are doing.
    <br>If not for the Spirit of God, I don't know if I would be standing here to give this testimony.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>My word of advice for the viewers is: Have faith in God.
    <br>Believe in His Word.
    <br>Whatever situation you are facing, He is the Healer and Deliverer.
    <br>He can deliver you and heal you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And remember; it is not possible to have faith in God and believe His Word
    <br>when you are far from Him.
    <br>It means you have to come close to Him.
    <br>You have to come to His presence.
    <br>We believe that before, when this evil spirit started tormenting your life,
    <br>you were not close to God, right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Not at all.
    <br>Now, that you are delivered, you are close to God,
    <br>it is not possible for such evil spirit to attack you or to possess you or to influence you.
    <br>That is a lesson for everyone, particularly our youth all over the world.
    <br>The Bible said, "Remember your Creator in the days of your youth",
    <br>because satan is out there, as the Bible says, as a roaring lion,
    <br>seeking whom he may devour.
    <br>We thank God that you are free today.
    <br>For your miracle to be permanent, you have to make the Word of God
    <br>the Standard for your life.
    <br>And we pray that God Almighty will give the grace to do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Once again, let's clap for Jesus Christ!
