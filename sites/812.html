    <br>There is an issue of will.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>There is an issue of will.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>That is why they have attempted to separate you from your loved ones.
    <br>Pray against the spirit of death that keeps appearing to you.
    <br>Your dear ones who are dead keep appearing to you when you sleep.
    <br>They keep talking with you and do everything with you.
    <br>By the time you wake up, you realise that they are dead.
    <br>"Why am I seeing dead people?"
    <br>You are correct, sir.
    <br>Come out in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Good morning, Church.
    <br>My name is Helen Nathaniel.
    <br>I am a civil servant and I live in Abuja (Nigeria).
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of seized menstruation,
    <br>for seventeen years.
    <br>During this period, I was always seeing dead people in my dreams.
    <br>I went to many hospitals when this problem started,
    <br>as far back as 1997.
    <br>I have been to many specialist hospitals.
    <br>The doctors were able to diagnose hormonal imbalance.
    <br>All the hospitals I went to in Abuja, Lagos, Ibadan, diagnosed hormonal imbalance.
    <br>At a stage, I got tired of taking the pills they were always administering to me.
    <br>Because at the end of the day, there was no solution, no results.
    <br>I am not talking of seventeen days, weeks, or months, but seventeen good years.
    <br>And as a woman, you know the implications.
    <br>I was doing that and at a stage, I had nothing more to sow.
    <br>I decided to pray on my own.
    <br>I started staying indoors on Sundays; I didn't go out.
    <br>One day I was just strolling out and somebody gave me a flyer
    <br>and asked me to come to a certain church.
    <br>I wondered if it wasn't like the other churches.
    <br>I just summoned up courage and went there.
    <br>On getting to that church, something happened.
    <br>The man of God there asked all the church members
    <br>to go and install Emmanuel TV in their homes.
    <br>I went out, bought my own and installed it.
    <br>The very day I installed it, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua appeared to me in my dream.
    <br>He started deliverance right in this church.
    <br>After installing Emmanuel TV?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>The very day I installed it, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua appeared to me in my dream.
    <br>He started deliverance right in this church.
    <br>So I found myself in this auditorium.
    <br>He conducted deliverance on me and two dwarfs left my body.
    <br>Dwarfs?
    <br>Yes, two left my body in that dream and the church started clapping.
    <br>The dwarfs were wearing bedroom slippers.
    <br>They were just jumping about.
    <br>I was born in Lagos and I grew up in Lagos.
    <br>I received both my basic and tertiary education here in the Southwest
    <br>but I have never been to The SCOAN.
    <br>After I had prayed with the man of God on Emmanuel TV, I slept again.
    <br>This was the second time.
    <br>This time, I saw the man of God in my village
    <br>and he prayed with me in that dream.
    <br>After that prayer, I said, "Ok, maybe it's time to visit The SCOAN".
    <br>So, I made up my mind and came.
    <br>But something happened on the day I came here. That was on the 11th of January 2015.
    <br>When I was at the entrance,
    <br>the ushers gave me a pass but I said, "No, I will not take it".
    <br>They said, "Madam, take your pass. Go in!" but I said, "No, I will not enter the church!"
    <br>"Take it!" and I said, "No!"
    <br>The ushers were very very patient with me.
    <br>They were able to calm the spirit
    <br>because I know it was the spirit that was at work.
    <br>I now came in. When I came in, I got a place and sat down.
    <br>Why did you refuse to come in?
    <br>I don't know. I came all the way from Abuja.
    <br>Can you imagine that? Somebody who came to The SCOAN
    <br>and at the entrance with the opportunity to enter, she said she's not entering again.
    <br>Can you see the reason why dwarfs came out?
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Ms Helen Nathaniel - Prophecy Testimony
    <br>When the man of God came out and started giving prophecies,
    <br>that was how he was able to locate me
    <br>as can be seen in the clip we watched.
    <br>Before I came here, I was seeing dead people.
    <br>All the prophecies the man of God gave to me were all accurate.
    <br>I was arranged for prayer line.
    <br>Along the prayer line, the man of God prayed for us.
    <br>The first time he passed, he touched my head.
    <br>The second time he passed, he touched my tummy.
    <br>When I got to where I was staying, in the night, between 1am and 2am, something happened.
    <br>My lower region - from my lower abdomen down - started shaking; it started vibrating.
    <br>Then, I felt something like a rod inside me with force
    <br>as if somebody used an iron to push inside my body.
    <br>I jumped out of the bed.
    <br>My legs started shaking. The left leg became paralyzed
    <br>and there was a mark that I saw there.
    <br>I was afraid, I didn't know it was deliverance that was taking place.
    <br>I was so scared.
    <br>When I saw the mark on my legs, I could not even stand.
    <br>In the morning, I discovered that the menses that seized for seventeen years had started flowing.
    <br>Ms Helen Nathaniel - Prophecy Testimony
    <br>God used the prophecy of the man of God to restore my menses.
    <br>For the past one year and three months, I don't have any problem with my menses.
    <br>It has been flowing normally.
    <br>I give God all the glory.
    <br>Ms Helen Nathaniel - Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My advice to the viewers all over the world is to just be patient and trust in God.
    <br>It is only God that can do it.
    <br>I advise them to look for a living church and be worshipping there.
