    <br>Can I speak to you?
    <br>Yes, sir, you can speak to me.
    <br>Are you ready to give your child to somebody?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I see somebody living inside you.
    <br>Come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are two. There is a demon that is trying to destroy your life, claiming to be your husband.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Look here!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Before I count two, you must be here. One, two.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Leave me alone.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Leave me alone. T.B. Joshua, leave me alone.
    <br>You've been disturbing me.
    <br>Since I came here, you've been disturbing me. Leave me alone.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>I should leave you alone?
    <br>I have told you. She belongs to me. Leave me alone.
    <br>I said leave me alone. Can't you hear? She belongs to me.
    <br>Everything – mine, mine.
    <br>Who?
    <br>I say it's mine. I am her husband.
    <br>Who is your husband?
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>He is your husband?
    <br>Me?
    <br>You've been disturbing me since I came here.
    <br>Who is inside you?
    <br>I am her husband now.
    <br>He is your husband?
    <br>Who is he?
    <br>Her husband. I had her since…
    <br>But that man she married, that praying man, always giving me trouble like that.
    <br>The man will not rest – prayer, prayer, prayer.
    <br>I nearly killed her the last time, car accident.
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>Why is this man disturbing me?
    <br>This is the thing, that we married since.
    <br>When we went to the water, we did an agreement, we did wedding, we had children.
    <br>Suddenly, she carried a Bible – born again, born again, born again.
    <br>That man she married – prayer, prayer, prayer.
    <br>Where is he?
    <br>The man is in the US, I am telling you.
    <br>So, you came from the US?
    <br>So, he is a prayer warrior?
    <br>Too much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He will not let me, the true husband, stay.
    <br>I said leave my wife to come back. He refused.
    <br>Since he married my queen, no progress. His finances…
    <br>You locked him.
    <br>Are you joking with me? She's my queen. Can't you see her?
    <br>She is my queen.
    <br>Let her go.
    <br>Let her go, T.B. Joshua, let her go.
    <br>I should have got rid of her last time.
    <br>Every time she's pregnant - accident, accident, accident.
    <br>Come, give me your hand.
    <br>No.
    <br>Give me your hand.
    <br>No, you won't deceive me. You will take my power.
    <br>What are you doing here? Give me space.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Come here.
    <br>You will take my power.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>It is one of the visitors from the US.
    <br>Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Leave me alone.
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Fire all over your body, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Manifestation Of Evil Spirits
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>One, two.
    <br>Your hands up.
    <br>Who is Jesus?
    <br>He is Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>See what is coming out from her.
    <br>Vomiting Poisonous Substances
    <br>Your back on the floor.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus' name, she is free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>She doesn’t know how she got there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>She is shy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She has now come to her real self.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>Man of God. Good afternoon, sir.
    <br>You said what?
    <br>Good afternoon, sir.
    <br>You said what?
    <br>Man of God. God bless you, sir.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>I don’t know. What happened?
    <br>I was sitting there, I think you came and I touched you.
    <br>I don’t know what else happened.
    <br>I was sitting there, beside her.
    <br>Where is your child? Your daughter?
    <br>Where is she?
    <br>Sir, that's my baby.
    <br>What brought you here?
    <br>I don’t know. I was sitting down there.
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>Me?
    <br>I was sitting with my child.
    <br>What happened? Please help me.
    <br>You don't know what happened?
    <br>No, I know I was sitting there. Man of God, I think you came that way.
    <br>I don't know what happened.
    <br>Why are you greeting me, 'Good afternoon'?
    <br>It is a pleasure, sir, to meet you.
    <br>And you have abused me.
    <br>You called me, "T.B. Joshua, what has happened to me?"
    <br>Me?
    <br>You want to slap me?
    <br>No, Man of God, please, sorry, sir. I'm so sorry, sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>I don't behave like this. Not me.
    <br>People who know me will tell you that I am "soft-spoken". I don't even...
    <br>You said?
    <br>I am soft-spoken, I don’t talk too much.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Ada, I am from the United States of America.
    <br>My experience here has been absolutely wonderful, amazing, marvellous.
    <br>A lot of breakthrough in my life.
    <br>For example, this morning during the first service,
    <br>I was delivered from a mermaid spirit and set free.
    <br>It was a marvellous deliverance today and I know
    <br>my life will never be the same because, as the man of God says, our past is over.
    <br>My past is really over today.
    <br>The experience I had here today was just absolutely fantastic and I will never ever forget it.
    <br>After the prayer, it was as if something left my body, something left my stomach.
    <br>I just felt it go out, and I feel free, happier, relaxed.
    <br>I feel definitely free and lighter since the deliverance today.
    <br>I say to people out there, this is real.
    <br>The man of God is real. There is nothing fake about it.
    <br>The power of God is actually here, alive and well.
    <br>I have seen it, I have tasted it, I have experienced it today
    <br>and I really thank God today for that experience.
    <br>Believe God, trust God and God will do the same that He's done for me in your lives,
    <br>in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen.
    <br>We pray that God will grant you the grace
    <br>that your deliverance and freedom will remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
