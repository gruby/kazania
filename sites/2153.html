  <p>    
    <br>My name is Memory and I come from the United Kingdom.
    <br>And the person beside me is my young sister, Belinda.
    <br>My testimony goes like this:
    <br>I was working for one of the good companies in the United Kingdom for years.
    <br>This year, around January, there were people that I used to work with
    <br>who ganged up against me and wrote emails to my bosses and I was sacked.
    <br>When I was sacked, it was hard as I am the breadwinner of the family.
    <br>I come from a poor background
    <br>and I have to look after people back home, including my dad and my other siblings.
    <br>So it was really hard.
    <br>And especially in the United Kingdom, you have no alternative but to pay your bills on time.
    <br>I was so heartbroken
    <br>and I knew the people who had sent these emails containing false allegations, resulting in me being sacked.
    <br>It was really hard for me to accept it; it was tough.
    <br>But I am one of the Emmanuel TV viewers all over the world.
    <br>I always watch Emmanuel TV and listen to the man of God's teachings.
    <br>As the man of God teaches us every day, we always have to forgive.
    <br>It was hard to forgive, but I had to forgive.
    <br>One day I wrote an email to the man of God, pouring out my heart.
    <br>I was crying, I was depressed and I did not know what to do
    <br>because everything was stuck.
    <br>Financially I was very unstable.
    <br>Knowing that my dad and my siblings at home were struggling, it was really difficult.
    <br>I wrote an email to the man of God asking, "Why this? Why that?".
    <br>It was written from deep down in my heart and I needed to do that.
    <br>That very day, which was on a Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua preached 'The Benefit Of Failure'.
    <br>When he preached on this, he said, "I've been reading emails ..." and immediately I felt very hot within me.
    <br>I just knelt down and started praying.
    <br>I knew it was my email he was referring to. He said, "I need to teach you about the benefits of failure".
    <br>The man of God said, "Whatever situation that you are in today,
    <br>it is to take you to the next level, regardless of what you are facing".
    <br>And I knew that he said this because of what I had written in my email.
    <br>After that I decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>I came here and was delivered.
    <br>I received my deliverance as I was leaving. I was blessed with the blessing of the Morning Water.
    <br>I was ministering the Morning Water every day. This is the life that I live.
    <br>I am one of the Emmanuel TV viewers all over the world.
    <br>As the man of God has taught us, my main prayer was, "God help me to forgive",
    <br>because this was so hard for me, especially when you know the people who have made you sad.
    <br>I went back home and had a dream that man of God said, "Congratulations!" to me.
    <br>When he said this, I just said, "God, thank You. I receive".
    <br>So, this is how things started happening while ministering the Morning Water.
    <br>I started feeling this force within me saying, "Stop working for people. Start your own business".
    <br>I did not know exactly what to do.
    <br>One day I was wearing my uniform and said, "I am a carer; I was born a carer. Why am I not doing this for myself?".
    <br>This was when I decided to open my own company.
    <br>I looked for a business partner and God blessed me with one.
    <br>I opened my company and God was so faithful to us.
    <br>Within the first week of registering our company,
    <br>we were awarded a very big contract for the supply of products to them as a recruiting agency.
    <br>So we started supplying. It was amazing.
    <br>Within a week, we had people calling and joining us.
    <br>And the people that had set me up knew that I had opened the company.
    <br>They started sending out emails saying, "Do not work for her; do not join her".
    <br>But they did not realise how wonderful my God is.
    <br>They made me so popular.
    <br>The phone calls did not cease.
    <br>People started working for us, including the people who had written the emails and gotten me sacked.
    <br>They also joined us and today they are part of our team.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>HOW T.B. JOSHUA'S TEACHING ON FORGIVENESS CHANGED MY LIFE!!!
    <br>When we started the business we thought that at around six months we would look for an office,
    <br>because we were working from home.
    <br>People of God, within three weeks,
    <br>the business grew so much that we had more than 100 staff working for us -
    <br>working for me as the director of the company.
    <br>HOW TB JOSHUA'S TEACHING ON FORGIVENESS CHANGED MY LIFE!!!
    <br>Within three weeks, we started looking for a recruitment office and God blessed us with an office.
    <br>As soon as He blessed us with an office, I remembered the stickers that I was also blessed with.
    <br>I took the Good Morning Sticker and put it in the office.
    <br>God then blessed us with a very big contract with one of the largest companies in the United Kingdom,
    <br>which has more than 30 branches.
    <br>And we are the main supplier for them.
    <br>It is just amazing being able to issue an invoice for a week's work for more than 25,000 Pounds for someone like me.
    <br>I can only say, "Thank You, Jesus!".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Morning Water Testimony
    <br>Madam, there are two key points that you touched on that are so important.
    <br>You mentioned forgiveness - that those people that seemed like your enemies, that you forgave them.
    <br>And then also the benefit of failure.
    <br>Can you just elaborate on that
    <br>and encourage people that whatever situation they are in, how should they handle it?
    <br>I will start with the benefit of failure.
    <br>I was one of them, because I had a lot of questions, "Why?".
    <br>This is even what I included in my email: "Why am I having these troubles? Why am I facing this? I pray and I fast".
    <br>But when the man of God told us about the benefit of failure, I wrote everything down that he said.
    <br>He said that some of the challenges that we face every day
    <br>are there to take us to the next level of our lives - where I am today.
    <br>The second thing, forgiveness.
    <br>Forgiveness is very hard.
    <br>It was hard for me because people took the bread from the mouths of my children.
    <br>But I didn't have a choice, I had to forgive.
    <br>I had to pray and say, "God, help me to forgive", as it was too much for me to do on my own.
    <br>If I had asked them "Why?", then I would not be here today giving this testimony.
    <br>I believe it is very important - it is a must, it is not a choice.
    <br>You don't have to choose to forgive.
    <br>It is a must - you need to forgive.
    <br>Indeed, if God Almighty is to forgive us, we are to forgive others.
    <br>Because God cannot forgive us if we refuse to release forgiveness ourselves.
    <br>So, thank God Almighty that you have made this wise decision.
    <br>We can see some pictures and documents on the board.
    <br>Can you please explain them to us?
    <br>This is the Certificate Of Incorporation of my company, the recruiting agency.
    <br>This is my business partner and I in our new office with our Good Morning Sticker.
    <br>This one is the other side of the office, with our Good Morning Sticker.
    <br>God has also blessed me with the latest Mitsubishi 4X4 vehicle.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>HOW TB JOSHUA'S TEACHING ON FORGIVENESS CHANGED MY LIFE!!!
    <br>I want to address the viewers all over the world, because I am one of them:
    <br>You need to forgive.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in today, look at it from the positive side.
    <br>It is to take you to the next level.
    <br>And the God we serve will definitely take you to the next level.
    <br>And for forgiveness, like I have said, it is hard, it is painful, you will cry,
    <br>you want to ask, you want to know why.
    <br>It's not worth it. You need to let go.
    <br>It is a must; it is not a choice.
    <br>You don't have a choice on forgiveness. You just have to.
    <br>Like I said, if I had gone to ask about my sacking, maybe God would not have promoted me.
    <br>If I did not face those challenges where I did not do anything wrong, but people ganged up against me and said,
    <br>"She must leave. She must fall". This was the language they used.
    <br>If it wasn't for that falling, I wouldn't be here today.
    <br>Hallelujah. The righteous may stumble, but they will get up.
    <br>All men fall, but the great ones get back up.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life.
    <br>It is very evident that we can see that forgiveness makes the future possible.
    <br>And whatever situation you are facing, God is using that benefit of failure, unpleasant circumstances,
    <br>to raise you to a new level in life.
    <br>And we pray that God Almighty will make it permanent in your life,
    <br>as you make God's Word the standard for your life, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
