    <br>My Family Was Spared From A Deadly Tornado Through Morning Water!!!
    <br>Good morning. My name is Janice Kwofie from Ohio, USA.
    <br>Recently - as an Emmanuel TV Partner - me and my family were blessed
    <br>with the New Morning Water and Sticker from T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Little did I know that God was going to use these faith tools to save our family!
    <br>A terrible tornado hit Dayton, Ohio, where I live in the USA on Monday May 27, 2019.
    <br>We had prayed with the Morning Water and were getting ready for bed
    <br>when the sirens went off for a tornado warning.
    <br>We went to our safe spot, thinking nothing about it.
    <br>We want to get right to that breaking news - Tornados across the Heartland.
    <br>Take a look at Dayton, Ohio as the sun rises.
    <br>People waking up to scenes like this.
    <br>So much devastation - their homes, apartment buildings, businesses and schools destroyed.
    <br>The  Midwest is hit so hard overnight.
    <br>Dayton, one of the largest cities in Ohio was struck by back-to-back twister.
    <br>We woke up in the morning with our lights out and friends calling and texting to see if we were okay.
    <br>Little did I know that - just a block away from our house -
    <br>every house, apartment and business had been destroyed!
    <br>People had lost everything.
    <br>You could see houses with no walls - you could see the bed, and houses with no roofs.
    <br>It was just a mess.
    <br>That is when we realized that the New Morning Water and the New Morning Sticker we received -
    <br>that God is truly present when you use the New Morning Water.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for saving us and sparing all our neighbours' lives.
    <br>This was done only by the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua!
    <br>We have heard people's testimonies but we never even thought that we were going to be spared
    <br>because of the New Morning Water that God blessed us with.
    <br>Dayton, Ohio - fire chief calls it a miracle that there are no reports of deaths,
    <br>after at least two tornados slammed Ohio overnight.
    <br>The storms left behind debris and devastation in Dayton.
    <br>It's a blessing to be an Emmanuel TV partner.
    <br>They're always praying for you even when you feel like you can't.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>I encourage everybody listening to me to be an Emmanuel TV partner.
    <br>Emmanuel TV partner does not mean that you give all your wealth or all your money and go hungry.
    <br>No! Emmanuel TV partner means to take care of each other,
    <br>to love your neighbour as yourself, to let go of unforgiveness.
    <br>Better is not good enough, the best is yet to come!
    <br>DO YOU HAVE A TESTIMONY?
    <br>SUBMIT YOUR TESTIMONY NOW!
