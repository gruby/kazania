    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There is a gentleman here - I see your hot temper will lead you to murder.
    <br>For you to know that I am talking to you, you are a military personnel.
    <br>You removed your gun and kept it somewhere.
    <br>I used that to describe you.
    <br>Your wife is provoking you. a
    <br>The way I am seeing things going, you will murder this woman one day with serious anger.
    <br>I am seeing you being charged with murder.
    <br>This is what I am seeing.
    <br>Saying this is unnecessary, but because of this issue of killing - anger that will lead you to kill -
    <br>it is a serious thing.
    <br>This anger is becoming more now.
    <br>You will not be able to contain it because I am seeing this woman provoking you; this is the third time now.
    <br>Please, come out.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Chikolola. I come from Zambia.
    <br>The people standing next to me: this is my lovely wife, Pamela,
    <br>my senior brother's wife, Anna, and my older brother Jewette.
    <br>I am a security personnel.
    <br>Last Sunday, during the service, the man of God prophesied,
    <br>"There is a man with a hot temper. This man is of a military background."
    <br>He said, "This man is provoked by the wife most of the time, and because of his hot temper,
    <br>he is likely to commit murder.
    <br>When he was coming, he dropped his gun somewhere."
    <br>When I heard this prophecy, I was amazed because, looking at my security training, I said this was me.
    <br>What really surprised me was that when I came here,
    <br>I came for other issues in my life because I had been having difficulties.
    <br>In my business there was nothing to show.
    <br>I was drinking heavily, especially as I was into beer parlour business.
    <br>So, I said, "Let me go and seek the face of God."
    <br>But I was surprised that the man of God pointed out things which were happening in my home, in my bedroom.
    <br>This was my first time visiting The SCOAN.
    <br>I was surprised at the prophecy and I really confirm it.
    <br>The prophecy I received is true and Prophet T.B. Joshua is a true man of God.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>The man of God emphasized the issue of hot temper. What can you say about this?
    <br>I had grown up with it.
    <br>Even when I went into marriage, my wife didn't really know that I was hot tempered.
    <br>I am a person who is easily provoked and when I am provoked, I can do anything.
    <br>Due to the nagging and differences, I was thinking, "How can I get rid of this woman?"
    <br>I reached a situation where I could have even committed murder, and the man of God said,
    <br>"If he goes back, he will likely commit murder if he is provoked."
    <br>This is very true about me and my hot temper.
    <br>I confirm it to be very true.
    <br>Each time I had differences with my wife,
    <br>I just thought the best thing was to kill her and kill myself or just kill myself just to be free.
    <br>That was all happening because of the anger in me.
    <br>When you are too angry, you can't think properly.
    <br>The Holy Spirit identified me through the true man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and I was delivered.
    <br>Since last Sunday, my life has been different.
    <br>I have been looking forward to seeing my wife.
    <br>I have been feeling cool.
    <br>My life has changed.
    <br>Even the urge to drink beer is gone now!
    <br>I just have the urge to read the Bible, and I am planning to do a business that will keep me in the way of the Lord.
    <br>Once again, shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>My name is Pamela. I come from Zambia.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband, Chikolola.
    <br>Next to my husband is my sister in marriage, Mrs Anna.
    <br>Beside her is her husband, Jewette.
    <br>I am here to confirm the prophecy of the man of God that was given last Sunday during the live Sunday Service.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>When the man of God was giving this prophecy, I was back home in Zambia,
    <br>and I shouted, "This one is for my husband. Why is he not coming out?"
    <br>Then, after some time, I saw my husband coming out and I was very happy.
    <br>My husband is a very hot tempered man.
    <br>He can argue about any small thing.
    <br>When he is angry, he can throw anything at you.
    <br>Sometimes he could even throw plates or cups against the wall.
    <br>Sometimes I would just call him to remind him to pick up my daughter from school.
    <br>My husband would get angry and would go to a beer parlour, and would drink from morning until morning.
    <br>When he came home, he would get his gun and fire some gun shots outside.
    <br>Then we would come into the bedroom to say, "I will shoot you and I will shoot myself.
    <br>I promise you that the day you die, I will also die so that we will be buried at the same time."
    <br>When this happened, I usually called for help from our family to come to our rescue.
    <br>The last attempt was very serious; it was two or three months ago.
    <br>We had a quarrel, he went to the bedroom and he wanted to get a gun to shoot at me.
    <br>When I ran outside the house, he locked himself in the house and he was drinking from morning until evening.
    <br>It was getting late and we wanted to enter into the house
    <br>so we begged and pleaded with him to unlock the house, but he didn't.
    <br>When we were pleading with him, he put the gun into his mouth or pointed it at his head.
    <br>Then I called his brother and his wife and they came.
    <br>They pleaded with him and he opened the door.
    <br>I also want to confirm the prophecy of the man of God who said that when my husband came to The SCOAN
    <br>he left the gun somewhere.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>When my husband came to The SCOAN, he left the gun somewhere for security reasons.
    <br>I thank God for locating my husband and I believe he is delivered and he is a changed man.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true when the man of God said, "I see your wife pushing you."
    <br>Every time my husband got angry, instead of calming down the situation, I got more angry.
    <br>One time I almost ran over him with a car - that is how bad it was.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true.
    <br>I feel happy that my marriage is restored and delivered.
    <br>If the man of God did not locate my husband, I think I would be a dead woman by now.
    <br>So, I thank God for locating my husband through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>My name is Anna Masinja.
    <br>The man standing next to me is my brother-in-law, next to him is his wife,
    <br>and at the far end is my husband, Jewette.
    <br>I am here to confirm the prophecy given by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, during last Sunday Service.
    <br>It is true that my brother-in-law had, and I am emphasizing had, very hot temper
    <br>that was nearly fatal.
    <br>All the time there were serious, life-threatening fights in their home.
    <br>My husband and I arbitrated on so many occasions but to no avail.
    <br>In the end, my husband decided to sponsor all of us to come to The SCOAN, the arena of liberty,
    <br>in order to come and seek God's face, because the problem was getting out of hand.
    <br>He believed that God is in this place,
    <br>and this is true - God is in this place.
    <br>I was very happy on Sunday when Prophet T.B. Joshua, the man of God,
    <br>or should I say, God located us through that prophecy,
    <br>emphasizing the fiery temper of my brother-in-law.
    <br>I was very happy; I did not know what to do - to cry or to dance.
    <br>Since then, I have seen a changed person.
    <br>Now I have a different brother-in-law, thanks to God.
    <br>He is peace-loving, cheerful and we have shared the Word of God throughout our stay here.
    <br>I also noticed that the relationship between him and his wife has improved greatly.
    <br>It is marvellous, people of God - they don't want to part from one another.
    <br>This is a good thing that has happened in this family.
    <br>I want to thank God because deliverance and salvation has come to our family.
    <br>Not only to these two families, but to families all over the world.
    <br>People of God, this deliverance is so awesome and I am thanking God for this.
    <br>My advice to all the people in the world:
    <br>When you have problems like we had, don't run away from God, run to God;
    <br>there is salvation, there is so much peace.
    <br>Once you are located, you are never the same again.
    <br>My name is Dr Jewette Masinja.
    <br>I am a Minerals Engineering Lecturer at the University of Zambia.
    <br>I want to thank God for the wonderful prophecy
    <br>and indeed deliverance of my brother during the church service last Sunday.
    <br>I can confirm the prophecy from the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, to be completely accurate.
    <br>This is my younger brother standing next to me.
    <br>Next to him is his wife, Pamela, and my wife at the end, Anna.
    <br>I have always known my young brother to have a very hot temper.
    <br>It was a bit of a worry for me when he became a security officer.
    <br>I thought there would be risks arising because of that
    <br>but one would hope that maybe the training would somehow mollify him.
    <br>Unfortunately, that did not happen.
    <br>It is very true that on a number of occasions we have had to rush to their home to intervene
    <br>and try to bring some kind of sanity and understanding between husband and wife.
    <br>It is very true that the risk of Chikolola shooting his wife was very real.
    <br>We are very grateful that God used the man of God to identify and save my brother's life.
    <br>We are very grateful.
    <br>It demonstrates the faithfulness, graciousness and mighty love of God.
    <br>When I saw the prophecy last Sunday,
    <br>my wife and I supported my family members to come here to seek the face and favour of God.
    <br>When I was observing the prophecy on Sunday, I was very excited.
    <br>The graciousness of God occurred to me - He is interested in the very details of our lives.
    <br>That is fantastic.
    <br>I have heard the prophet on many occasions saying, "Where can we go from God? Where can we hide?"
    <br>We certainly cannot hide anywhere in any shape or form.
    <br>For me it was an example of the fact that God sees everything.
    <br>Not just that - He intervenes for the good.
    <br>People of God, God is gracious.
    <br>To those who are listening, I can state that God is gracious.
    <br>There are no circumstances where God is not interested and can't do anything about your situation.
    <br>He is faithful - if you seek His face, He will answer.
    <br>Your own situation will not escape God's grace and favour.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>What do you want to do right now to really confirm that all is well?
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>It is only Jesus Christ, in His infinite mercy, that can justly do it.
    <br>People of God, I am married again!
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My advice to viewers around the world as well as the members of the congregation
    <br>is that whenever you have a situation, don't take it upon yourself to have the solution.
    <br>The solution we have is always with God; don't run away from God.
    <br>Like my sister-in-law and older brother have said, God is gracious.
    <br>Let's run to God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Amen.
