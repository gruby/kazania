    <br>Good Morning, Church.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>God With Us (Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Judith Ngozi Eze; I am from Enugu State.
    <br>The person beside me is my good friend and also a sister to my husband.
    <br>The problem that brought me here was ceased menstruation and bedwetting.
    <br>I went to a spiritualist; when I got there, immediately the man saw me he started to tell me all the problems I had.
    <br>My brothers and sisters, he told me that I was going to sleep inside the altar.
    <br>He took me with other ladies there; we all went inside and I slept there.
    <br>When I had a dream that same day, I saw myself bedwetting.
    <br>When I got up early in the morning, my brothers and sisters, I had already bedwetted.
    <br>I felt shame; I called the others besides me to look at what had happened to me.
    <br>They rushed and called the spiritualist.
    <br>When the spiritualist came out, he asked me what had happened to me.
    <br>I started narrating; he told me God had met me.
    <br>I went away and the problem started.
    <br>I came with ten problems but when I was leaving I went back with a hundred problems!
    <br>I had setback in my business, nothing was moving,
    <br>no peace in my home, depression, nothing was going well.
    <br>If somebody invited me for something, I couldn't go; if I went, I had to sleep on a mat.
    <br>The last one I met with my mother, she announced to my mother my problems,
    <br>that I have the spirit of death and also that I cannot give birth any longer.
    <br>My mother came to me and took me to the spiritualist.
    <br>After doing and saying all sorts of things nothing happened.
    <br>My brothers and sisters, do you know what happened?
    <br>Last week on Sunday, my brother called me and my people, telling us that we don't have sense,
    <br>we don't have good character, we are not doing well and not behaving well like him;
    <br>that we should as the entire family go and buy a decoder and fix it in our home.
    <br>He said we are not doing well, that he has more sense than us because he is reasoning well,
    <br>because he has been watching Prophet T.B Joshua and praying.
    <br>So I had a thought in my mind when I went back to my house.
    <br>Just last month in June, I bought my own decoder and fixed it in my home.
    <br>This that I am telling you, it happened live in my own house last week on Sunday.
    <br>I told my children that we were going to have our service in our house, since we had bought the decoder.
    <br>They all followed me to the parlour and we switched on the Emmanuel TV channel.
    <br>My children and I started watching.
    <br>Immediately I heard the man of God Prophet T.B Joshua say I have been set aside for Jesus' attention,
    <br>I felt weak; I was telling my children and something flew out of me; I didn't know what was happening.
    <br>Immediately I saw Prophet T.B Joshua saying again that there was a lady in a pool of blood from South Africa.
    <br>So immediately I saw the blood, I went and touched the screen and fell down.

    <br>The next thing when I got up, I didn't know what was happening, I saw myself bleeding.
    <br>Mrs Judith Ngozi Eze & Sister-In-Law

    <br>I started seeing my menstruation and even till now, I'm still experiencing it!
    <br>Mrs Judith Ngozi Eze & Sister-In-Law
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>The picture on her phone is confirmation that her menstruation has begun to flow.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, please if you do not have any decoder in your house that can get Emmanuel TV,
    <br>please rush now and go and purchase one.
    <br>That is the only saviour; I am telling you the truth I am not trying to deceive you,
    <br>because I am a living testimony.
    <br>That was what helped me and today I am healed!
    <br>Mrs Judith Ngozi Eze & Sister-In-Law
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>So ever since you prayed along with Prophet T.B Joshua on Emmanuel TV,
    <br>since that moment the bedwetting you were experiencing daily right from birth.
    <br>No more; I am free!
    <br>Mrs Judith Ngozi Eze & Sister-In-Law
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>I am Ifoma Ugu; I am from Enugu State.
    <br>The woman beside me is my sister-in-law; I witnessed everything.
    <br>I have been watching Emmanuel TV, seeing everybody, but this is my first time coming here.
    <br>We were very happy to see my sister-in-law watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The time the man of God was talking about a pool of blood from a lady on the screen,
    <br>my sister-in-law just put her hand on the screen and fell down and blood started rushing.
    <br>I am a living witness for that; I even have a recording on my phone.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus
    <br>Mrs Judith Ngozi Eze & Sister-In-Law
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>Just as my sister-in-law said, I advise everyone who does not have Emmanuel TV at home to get it
    <br>because it is real; I am a living witness for that.
