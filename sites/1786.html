    <br>Viewers all over the world,  if we throw up our hands, God's hands have room to work.
    <br>What do I mean, viewers?
    <br>Like a little baby who opens his arms, viewers, with all your heart, pray with me.
    <br>In our heart, we are made to be like Jesus.
    <br>Lord, I want to be like Jesus
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord Jesus, You have been with us in every challenge we have faced since we were born.
    <br>With each new challenge, we have grown.
    <br>This means, our challenge makes us stronger.
    <br>What is virus?
    <br>What is that challenge?
    <br>We are waiting to see what You will do next.
    <br>Lord Jesus, You know all that is wrong inside and outside us.
    <br>Deliver us, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You know all that is wrong inside and outside us.
    <br>Heal us, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>With Your healing hand, heal us, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>With You, all things are possible.
    <br>We know Your name is Healer.
    <br>Heal them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Restore them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Restore them, I command, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I know You will assure them that You are in control.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You have been with us in every challenge.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Whatever chain, whatever medium satan might have used to connect you to himself,
    <br>to connect your finances to himself, to connect your health to himself,
    <br>to connect your career to himself, to connect your marriage to himself,
    <br>whatever medium satan might have used to connect your marriage to himself -
    <br>be disconnected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be disconnected and be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Whatever medium satan might have used to connect you to himself, to connect your marriage to himself,
    <br>to connect your career to himself, your business to himself, your finances to himself -
    <br>be disconnected and be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank You for assuring them.
    <br>Thank You for Your assurance.
    <br>Soon, we will be praising You, Lord, for all You have done.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank You for Your assurance. You assured them that You are in control.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>I can hear chains breaking!
    <br>I can see chains breaking!
    <br>Chain of hardship - be broken, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Chain of setback - be broken, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Chain of affliction, e.g. virus - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Listen.
    <br>Soon, we will be praising God for all He has done for you.
    <br>He has done for me
    <br>He has done for you
    <br>What your father cannot do
    <br>He has done for you
    <br>He has healed you!
    <br>He has blessed you!
    <br>Chain of virus - be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see chains breaking!
    <br>This is not an idea; this is reality.
    <br>Listen to me. It is happening now.
    <br>I can hear the sound of chains.
    <br>Yes! This is not an idea.
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>Look at my track record.
    <br>Look at my antecedent.
    <br>Look at the person talking to you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Soon, we will be praising God for all He has done.
    <br>He has healed you. He has delivered you. He has restored you.
    <br>He has redeemed you. He has saved you.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>This is a vision!
    <br>This is what is happening now!
    <br>It's happening as I am talking to you!
    <br>Yes, there is assurance.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Lord, for Your assurance.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>To maintain your blessing - which I'm sure you are blessed, which I'm sure you are delivered.
    <br>Yes, I'm sure. This is assurance.
    <br>To maintain your blessing, determine to set aside a special time each day to read your Bible with devotion.
    <br>If I may encourage you on how to read your Bible: read slowly, attentively, and repeatedly.
    <br>This prayer and counselling is not time-bound.
    <br>Anytime you hear it, it maintains God's power, God's grace.
    <br>Lisen to that.
    <br>Anytime you listen to it, you hear it, you pray with me, and you hear this prayer,
    <br>it maintains God's grace, God's power, God's anointing.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I want to leave you in faith, expecting to meet you in faith.
    <br>Good Morning and Win Today!
    <br>Thank you.
