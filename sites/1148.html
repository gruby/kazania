    <br>God's intervention, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Right now, begin to seal your blessings with the blood of Jesus.

    <br>Right now, for those who are coming.
    <br>Like I have said today,
    <br>salvation is not just saying, "Come into my life, wash me with Your precious blood, save my soul"
    <br>and then going on your own merry way.
    <br>No.
    <br>Commitment.
    <br>The commitment will introduce you to Jesus and you will become Jesus' property.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Right now, with the message you have listened to,
    <br>let the Spirit of God abide in you.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Lord Jesus, come into my heart!
    <br>Wash me with Your precious blood!
    <br>Save my soul today!
    <br>Make me Your channel - Your channel of shining light,
    <br>Your channel of love,
    <br>Your channel of obedience,
    <br>Your channel of pardon,
    <br>Your channel of forgiveness.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Let the people of God say, "Amen".
    <br>[Amen]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen]
