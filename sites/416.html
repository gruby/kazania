    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Hungary
    <br>My name is Magyari Laszlo, I am a pastor and evangelist from Hungary.
    <br>Thank you very much. You are very welcome here today.
    <br>Can you tell us what was the problem that you were having, that brought you to The SCOAN?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I had a skin disease since 2012, when spots started appearing on my legs.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>It began spreading all over my body.
    <br>Can you tell us what type of skin disease were you having?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I went to a doctor and he diagnosed me with a skin disease called psoriasis.
    <br>So you mean you were having the problem of psoriasis, a very severe skin disease for three years. Is that right?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I had this skin disease for three years.
    <br>I was not able to sleep, to do my daily routine or work.
    <br>Can you tell us what were some of the symptoms that you were experiencing
    <br>as a result of this skin disease?
    <br>How did it affect your body?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I had inflammation in my system and my skin started to peel off.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>My skin was itching all the time to the point where my skin started to bleed.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I had to stop my work and could not do the evangelism ministry.
    <br>OK. You mentioned that you are a pastor and evangelist.
    <br>Can you explain to us how this problem of having this severe skin disease affected you in your ministry?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I was not able to go out and do evangelism.
    <br>I had to stay at home and use Skype to talk to people.
    <br>We can see on the board right now some pictures which are showing the condition of our brother
    <br>when he was having this problem of skin disease - psoriasis.
    <br>Can you point to the pictures and explain to us about the sickness?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>This is my back.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I had spots all over and it was a large area of inflammation.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>This had spread all over my body.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>This skin disease appeared on my head, back and stomach.
    <br>I was only able to sleep face down.
    <br>We are seeing on the screen right now the extent of how far this sickness had gone.
    <br>It seriously affected his back and other parts of his body.
    <br>Sir, can you tell us, was this skin disease spreading to all parts of your body?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>This had spread all over my body.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>On my sides, arms, legs - it was all over my body.
    <br>We can see on the screen right now how the skin disease had affected the other areas of his body.
    <br>This is showing his neck and other parts of his body,
    <br>to show how serious and severe the sickness was and how it had affected every area of his life.
    <br>He mentioned that even as a pastor and an evangelist he was not able to minister to people because of this skin disease.
    <br>He had to instead communicate with them through the Internet or through the phone.
    <br>He was not able to meet with them personally.
    <br>He had to stay in his house all the time, as a result of this problem.
    <br>Sir, can you tell us, where did you go in search of a solution to this problem?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I was searching on the Internet for healing and miracles as I was browsing.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I was looking for places where there were opportunities for healing.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I watched a lot of ministries
    <br>and then on YouTube I found the Ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>Then I started to watch his ministry.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I came by faith believing that everything was possible for him who believes.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>Before I came, I watched Prophet T.B. Joshua's ministry and I saw miracles and healings that people received.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>We are hearing how our brother searched on the Internet for anything that had to do with healing or miracles
    <br>because of the extent that his situation had gotten to; he was in a desperate state.
    <br>We just want to ask you, did you go to different hospitals for treatment in search of a solution?
    <br>What were the doctors telling you about this problem?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I went to hospitals looking for a solution.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>The doctors told me that this was a disease that could not be healed.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>There was no solution for it.
    <br>So the doctors told you there was no cure, and that it was an incurable disease.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>There is no solution at all for this disease.
    <br>That was what the doctor said.
    <br>After you looked on the Internet and you found Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV and you saw the miracles, healings,
    <br>can you tell us what happened next?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>After that, I had a dream in which I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua and was told to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me in my dream, I saw four snakes appear
    <br>and T.B. Joshua hit the snakes' heads
    <br>and smoke came and these snakes disappeared.
    <br>This was my call to come to The SCOAN. I was sure.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We have been hearing how God truly prepared this brother for his miracle
    <br>and what happened when he came here was just as a result and an extension of what had already happened over there, in the Spirit.
    <br>He said he had a dream after watching Emmanuel TV and seeing the miracles on YouTube.
    <br>He saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying for him here at The SCOAN,
    <br>and suddenly four big snakes appeared.
    <br>But when the man of God stretched his hand towards the snakes, they disappeared
    <br>and a cloud of smoke appeared and the snakes were gone; they vanished.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>You were saying that as a result of that dream you found your way here to The SCOAN, the arena of liberty.
    <br>Can you tell us what happened when you came here?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>In June 2014, I came here to The SCOAN
    <br>and T.B. Joshua prayed for me at The Prayer Line.
    <br>And the next day I realised that the skin disease started to disappear from my legs.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Truly, with Jesus Christ nothing is impossible.
    <br>We are seeing on the screen right now how our brother here came to The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for him. He was arranged in the Prayer Line
    <br>for this problem of skin disease - psoriasis-  which has no known medical cure.
    <br>We can see right now, as the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua is praying for him,
    <br>he falls to the ground, in the power of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>as every sickness, disease in his body is being cast out, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>We could clearly see the reaction there of our brother
    <br>as the Holy Spirit was affecting him, and every sickness in his body was being transformed to good health.
    <br>You were telling us that as soon as the man of God prayed for you, things started to happen, things started to change.
    <br>Can you tell us what happened?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>Since then, I have been able to do ministry, evangelism and sleep well.
    <br>I realised that God helped me with this problem.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You mentioned that after the prayer and healing, you were able to go back to your normal activities, do you ministry and everything.
    <br>Can you tell us what happened to the skin problem?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>The skin disease disappeared from all over my body.
    <br>Since then, I have been able to move well.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus!
    <br>What was impossible for man is truly possible with Jesus Christ.
    <br>As our brother said, the skin disease that had spread to all parts of his body,
    <br>after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua began to disappear,
    <br>and now, to the glory of God, his body is free from skin disease.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We can see some pictures on the board showing your condition.
    <br>How you are now? Can you just point to these pictures, and to the glory of God,
    <br>show us what God Almighty has done in your life?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>This was in 2012. You can see the problem that I had of skin disease.
    <br>It was on my sides, stomach and everywhere on my body.
    <br>After the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua, I got healed
    <br>and you can see that the skin disease has disappeared and I am healed.
    <br>Glory to God!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Truly, you can see a radical transformation has taken place.
    <br>For the glory of God and the benefit of those that are watching us,
    <br>you said that this skin disease had spread to your entire body, including your legs.
    <br>Can you just roll up your trousers and just show the world how your legs are now?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>We just saw now on the screen how his legs are completely free from skin disease, skin problems.
    <br>How do you feel right now?
    <br>I feel very well. Glory to God!
    <br>How is your ministry, your life now? How is it when you are attending to people now?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>Thanks be to God, I am able to share the Gospel
    <br>and many people are getting saved and healed.
    <br>Amen! Truly, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>And just as this brother has been transformed, his health has been transformed,
    <br>God is using him to transform other people's lives as he ministers to them, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Sir, what is your advice to people all over the world who are having similar problems?
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>I asked God if I could share this testimony with everyone.
    <br>There are only three percent of the population of this world that are suffering from this disease.
    <br>I want to tell them that God is still healing and delivering today.
    <br>Pastor Magyari Laszlo
    <br>Prayer Line Testimony
    <br>Have faith in God and God will heal you.
    <br>Amen. Truly, the age of miracles has not passed.
    <br>Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday, today and forever, as our brother is reminding us.
    <br>We just want to advise you, now that you have been set free and healed completely by Christ's Word,
    <br>to continue in Christ's Word, in order to maintain this glorious testimony that you have received, in Jesus' name.

    <br>by the clip you have just watched.
