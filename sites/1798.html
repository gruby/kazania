    <br>CHINESE RESIDENTS CONFIRM TB JOSHUA'S CORONAVIRUS PROPHECY!!!
    <br>After the prophecy given by Prophet T.B. Joshua about the showers of rain
    <br>that would wipe away the fears of the unknown,
    <br>reports began to flood in from all over the world confirming the words of the man of God.
    <br>Here are just a few of the reports that people sent in:
    <br>I was waiting for a result.
    <br>And what is the result?
    <br>If we say rain will wipe this epidemic out of the earth, it must start from Wuhan, China -
    <br>where the whole thing started.
    <br>I've been hearing about Prophet T.B. Joshua from The SCOAN for so many years, ever since I was a little kid
    <br>but I never believed in him or any of his prophecies.
    <br>I'm not going to lie to you.
    <br>But something really happened and something changed my mind.
    <br>We started hearing the story of coronavirus around December of 2019.
    <br>We couldn't go out, eat or buy anything.
    <br>So, there was a lockdown everywhere; we were so scared.
    <br>I was just scrolling on Facebook trying to check what was going on.
    <br>I saw the prophecy. The prophet said, "By March 27, 2020, there won't be coronavirus again in China".
    <br>You listened to my message last year that this is a very, very fearful year
    <br>and I came out at the beginning of this year to say that last year will end in March
    <br>and the year will continue to be very, very fearful till this month.
    <br>This month, 27.
    <br>"...that is the epicentre and it was going to rain."
    <br>"If we say rain will wipe this epidemic out of the earth, it must start from Wuhan, China -
    <br>where the whole thing started.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>Immediately, I called my friend and said, "Look at these people;
    <br>they have started with their fake prophecy again!"
    <br>My friend said, "Leave these people alone".
    <br>This is not supposed to happen in that place in this season.
    <br>And what is the purpose?
    <br>To wipe out this epidemic called coronavirus.
    <br>CHINESE RESIDENTS CONFIRM TB JOSHUA'S CORONAVIRUS PROPHECY!!!
    <br>I checked the weather and after checking the weather forecast,
    <br>it was not even showing that there was going to be rain!
    <br>And when we are talking about technology, we are talking about China!
    <br>To my greatest surprise, on the 23rd and 24th, it started raining heavily.
    <br>From the 23rd to the 26th, it was raining!
    <br>CHINESE RESIDENTS CONFIRM TB JOSHUA'S CORONAVIRUS PROPHECY!!!
    <br>And what is the purpose?
    <br>To wipe out this epidemic called coronavirus.
    <br>The SCOAN Living Water Service
    <br>I said, "Guys, this is really a great prophecy!"
    <br>I had a domestic helpers, Chinese people,
    <br>and I asked them whether the weather forecast showed that it was going to rain or not
    <br>on the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th and they said, "No," that they were also surprised.
    <br>I really wanted to confirm so I asked some of my ex-teammates and they said, "No".
    <br>But to our greatest surprise, all of a sudden,
    <br>the government said there were no new cases of coronavirus.
    <br>Everything became normal; people started going out.
    <br>I decided to go out and check for myself.
    <br>I went out; I was shocked!
    <br>There were even traffic jams.
    <br>Cars were piling up on the street!
    <br>I said, "If that is the case, my people are 'Thomas'; they must see.
    <br>If they don't see, they cannot believe".
    <br>I said to the Lord that this thing should happen where the coronavirus started,
    <br>which is a place called Wuhan, China.
    <br>CHINESE RESIDENTS CONFIRM TB JOSHUA'S CORONAVIRUS PROPHECY!!!
    <br>I never believed in the man of God.
    <br>I never believed in Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>but now God has really shown to me that our prophet is a real prophet of God!
    <br>All I know is - God is really using Prophet T. B. Joshua.
    <br>The rain I talked about will continue today, tomorrow and it will just continue.
    <br>In the night, you will see what will happen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>See! The man of God said there is not going to be any coronavirus again!
    <br>Take a look at this! No more coronavirus in China! Everything is okay!
    <br>I'm so happy! The rain is so heavy!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua said it and it's happening right now, live in China!
    <br>This March - from now till 27th, you have to be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>On March 27, 2020, the government declared China free of coronavirus!
    <br>Everything has gone back to normal!
    <br>People have gone back to work.
    <br>A lot of businesses have already opened.
    <br>CHINESE RESIDENTS CONFIRM TB JOSHUA'S CORONAVIRUS PROPHECY!!!
    <br>Just a month ago, China was reeling from the COVID-19 epidemic.
    <br>The country was in lockdown, its economy was in a deep freeze.
    <br>How different it all looks now.
    <br>Back in Wuhan where it all began, Chinese authorities have lifted lockdown
    <br>and are claiming community infection has ended.
    <br>What's your name, madam?
    <br>You can call me Tyler.
    <br>Your name is Tyler? Beautiful.
    <br>Tyler, nice to meet you.
    <br>Nice to meet you.
    <br>Is it over now in China?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Beautiful. Are you back to work now?
    <br>Yes, I have been working for about two weeks.
    <br>Oh, you started work two weeks ago.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Is it okay now with you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can I ask you a question: Why are you not wearing a mask?
    <br>Because I think the epidemic is over now.
    <br>Now, the number of patients is zero.
    <br>So, that is why I am not wearing a mask -
    <br>because I am comfortable the epidemic is over.
    <br>I just want everybody to know that Prophet T.B. Joshua said it; it's happening!
    <br>This is China! Before, we couldn't come outside.
    <br>So, this is it! I'm going to try and talk to some people.
    <br>I want some people to tell you the truth!
    <br>TALKING TO RESIDENTS IN CHINA
    <br>I asked him, "Is there still coronavirus in China?" He said, "No".
    <br>TALKING TO RESIDENTS IN CHINA
    <br>There is no coronavirus!
    <br>This is one of the people I am interviewing right now.
    <br>I just want everybody to know that it started before the 27th of March.
    <br>It rained! It rained for like three to five days!
    <br>And after then, the government declared that there was no coronavirus and everybody could come out!
    <br>And now, take a look at it!
    <br>Believe in your prophet and you shall be established!
    <br>This is not a lie; we are a living testimony here in Shanghai, China.
    <br>She's an optometrist and she's working on glasses.
    <br>How are you today?
    <br>Fine.
    <br>Media outside and within China pointed to Wuhan as the epicentre.
    <br>Now, restrictions have eased and everything is back to normal.
    <br>Do you think Wuhan is safe now?
    <br>Wuhan is safe. The few cases of coronavirus now are those returning to China from abroad.
    <br>There is no quarantine within China now.
    <br>March 27 was the last day for the virus to finish in the epicentre.
    <br>This is the confirmation of the prophecy from the Prophet, that whatever he prophesied came true.
    <br>Now, let's get in.
    <br>You see, this is a beautiful apple here in this city.
    <br>Now, let's get in and see what goes on there.
    <br>TALKING TO RESIDENTS IN CHINA
    <br>Right now, it is very peaceful here.
    <br>TALKING TO RESIDENTS IN CHINA
    <br>Yes, we have started working.
    <br>They started working again a long time ago. Everything is very safe now.
    <br>So, the prophecy that the man of God prophesied is confirmed.
    <br>TALKING TO RESIDENTS IN CHINA
    <br>We are now in a national trading company.
    <br>Their activities are concentrated on exporting Chinese products to foreign countries.
    <br>I'm here this morning to talk to some of the workers here at this company. Thank you.
    <br>My name is Sun.
    <br>Can I ask you - is the virus problem over in China now?
    <br>As you know now, everybody has come back to work
    <br>so I think it is not a problem in China.
    <br>Alright, very good.
    <br>Thank you, Madam Sun.
    <br>What should I call you?
    <br>You can call me Bryan.
    <br>Actually last month in February, the coronavirus in China was very serious.
    <br>The total number of cases was up to 80,000.
    <br>Now, I think under our government, everything is under control.
    <br>So, don't worry, you can see: Now, just like I said, we are all working here.
    <br>Not only our companies - all over the world, all over China, we have started working.
    <br>FOOTAGE FROM CHINA
    <br>The man of God said something the last time: that on the 27th
    <br>we were not going to have the issue of coronavirus again.
    <br>I never believed in the man of God that it was going to happen.
    <br>The man of God said there was going to be rain and it rained for about four to five days -
    <br>on the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th.
    <br>So, just take a look right now.
    <br>In China, there is no more coronavirus!
    <br>CHINESE RESIDENTS CONFIRM TB JOSHUA'S CORONAVIRUS PROPHECY!!!
    <br>Wuhan City, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak,
    <br>sprang back to life this Monday after a two-month-long shutdown.
    <br>Buses started operating early Monday morning, carrying workers back to work.
    <br>Hello. I am in Shanghai, China.
    <br>We started working March 27. 95% of our offices started working.
    <br>I am working here and this is my shop.
    <br>We are very peaceful here. Be rest assured; we have no virus now.
    <br>We were running helter-skelter for our dear lives
    <br>before the man of God said the things of God to intervene.
    <br>When the prophecy came, we had the showers of blessing.
    <br>Wuhan was the epicenter of the coronavirus.
    <br>I kept tracking the development of the outbreak;
    <br>it was thousands of infections a day.
    <br>Immediately after that prayer and the showers of blessing that we had in many cities in China,
    <br>the figures began to decline - from four figures, to three, two, one.
    <br>A week later, everything began to normalize.
    <br>And I was surprised! I said, "So this prophecy worked!"
    <br>I have all the records because I really wanted to be sure.
    <br>So, I kept all the records on my computer and I followed it until the third week when everything was zero.
    <br>Wuhan infections - zero.
    <br>Now we move very freely! Everything is normal.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua!
