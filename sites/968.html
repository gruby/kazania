  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, with God, all things are possible.
    <br>What are your challenges?
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>The life we live is what ushers us into the name, Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The life we live is what ushers us into Jesus' name."
    <br>The life I live is what ushers me into Jesus’ name.
    <br>You can't just wake up and say, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus...".
    <br>Where are you coming from?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>Merry Christmas in advance!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I remember the wonderful message you received last Sunday on how you can manage your life,
    <br>what you need to do to talk of salvation.
    <br>Here are poor people around you.
    <br>The relationship between salvation and how we manage our possessions.
    <br>We are about to enter a new year.
    <br>The solution you apply now will not be able to solve the challenges tomorrow.
    <br>It can only solve the challenges now.
    <br>Renewal!
    <br>Your way and the manner you live brings about what you are seeing around you.
    <br>When you want to pray, you don't know what to ask for, because there are numerous challenges.
    <br>Because of broken homes, people cannot come together in the morning to pray in the house.
    <br>Like I was saying...
    <br>The life we live is what moves us into calling Jesus’ name.
    <br>That is, the life in the line of God’s Word.
    <br>It is not what I'm doing now that will bring whatever you are going to see.
    <br>This has been done before my coming out.
    <br>Relationship.
    <br>This has been done already - I am only coming here to deliver it.
    <br>Not to work.
    <br>When you wake up in the morning, you need direction
    <br>and the direction only comes from the heart, where God lives.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is where God dwells which you can refer to as your spirit
    <br>but when you wake up and there is no direction, you make up direction for yourself.
    <br>These are the causes of challenges today – making up direction, self-direction.
    <br>God is our Director – the direction and the way is what we need now.
    <br>Your challenges – leave them for God; think about God.
    <br>Every blessing attracts challenges.
    <br>Blessing without challenges – you cannot manage the blessings.
    <br>Challenges help us to be strong and preserve us for God.
    <br>For this coming year you are about to enter, you need to be renewed.
    <br>You have everything you need - renewal is the only thing you don't have.
    <br>You say you are poor - I disagree; you are not poor.
    <br>You are not poor.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>You say you are poor because you don't know how to exploit the things around you.
    <br>There are so much blessings - you are in the midst of blessings.
    <br>You are in the midst of money - money is everywhere.
    <br>You need to be renewed in your spirit.
    <br>For how long shall we continue this...?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We are financially "buoyant" more than spiritual.
    <br>We are becoming more prosperous than spiritual.
    <br>That is a cause of your complaining.
    <br>Even if you have money, that complain will not go, that will not remove your nightmare, isolation or depression.
    <br>There are many sicknesses and afflictions for which there is no medicine.
    <br>You have money, you go to the doctor for the better treatment,
    <br>but there are many afflictions without medicine.
    <br>If you say money is the answer - what about afflictions without medicine?
    <br>These are curses - only God can remove them.
    <br>This new year, your spirit must be renewed.
    <br>When your spirit is renewed, you will discover yourself.
    <br>It is not your sweat or your labour that brings out that blessing you are talking about.
    <br>It is our relationship with God that causes this to happen.
    <br>When you are renewed spiritually, it will affect your family and children as well.
    <br>Ability to be able to put your challenges behind and meditate on Jesus - this is what you don't have.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Ability to be able to put your challenges behind and meditate on Jesus -
    <br>this is what we all lack."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Look at the Word: "In this world there will be challenges" - He said it.
    <br>He said, "Put it behind because I have overcome for you."
    <br>But the ability to put it behind...
    <br>When you have a headache - ignore that headache and focus on Jesus - that is the ability we need now.
    <br>You cannot be meditating on your challenges and on Jesus at the same time.
    <br>The ability to be able to put behind our situation.
    <br>The situation is there: You have a serious headache but you are more of Jesus - with all your heart you are yearning for Jesus.
    <br>Just put that behind you: The ability to be able to do that is what we lack.
    <br>It seems that our challenges overcome us.
    <br>We want to worship God without challenges.
    <br>Ability to put our challenges aside and worship Him - our spirits must be renewed.
    <br>To renew our spirits, right now, begin to meditate on the Word -
    <br>turn it over and over and over in our hearts.
    <br>Meditate on it and turn it over and over.
    <br>Turn it over - don't let it go.
    <br>Continue to meditate on it.
    <br>Before you know it...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are saturated already - before you know it.
    <br>You must prosper in your spiritual life first.
    <br>Get your spiritual life in order; that is where the power, ability of God lies.
    <br>There is nothing you have not enjoyed but the relationship with God, you've not enjoyed properly.
    <br>Everything: you enjoyed money, pleasure - but relationship with God in a proper way - you have not.
    <br>Why can't you put it before you and let it be your first priority?
    <br>There is nothing that can change you and bring what you are looking for.
    <br>That proper relationship.
    <br>It is time that you should know Him like children know their fathers.
    <br>Stop imagining Him: "Jesus said this...".
    <br>Somebody will tell you, "Jesus says this...".
    <br>You should be able to hear by yourself - it is time to hear this.
    <br>The life you live here is the life you are going to meet over there.
    <br>Don't let anybody tell you, "Heaven, Heaven...".
    <br>How do you live this life?
    <br>Heaven is reward.
    <br>What are you doing and expect a reward?
    <br>The file will be opened to you.
    <br>You are planting here - you will reap over there.
    <br>What are you planting?
    <br>Right now, our spiritual life is the first priority.
    <br>The money you are looking for, you can never have enough.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, “The wealth, possessions you are looking for, you can never have enough”.
    <br>Because we can never have enough, there is an urge to steal, to kill, and to destroy.
    <br>The urge - because we never can have enough money, possessions, and other things you are looking for.
    <br>It is not possible because there are always people above you.
    <br>In the spirit, in your relationship with God, there is a place for you.
    <br>There is a place for me, there is a place for you.
    <br>God purposely created a space for me, "OK, T.B. Joshua - this is yours. This is what to do".
    <br>This was only for me.
    <br>You too, you have your own space.
    <br>There is not much competition, that would make you to be having a...
    <br>... unless you are a "zero" - like at the level many of us are today.
    <br>You cannot sense or be filled.
    <br>The life we live is what moves us into what?
    <br>Jesus' name.
    <br>What kind of life are you living?
    <br>Jesus' name is not just something you can just come and claim, "Jesus, in Jesus..." - no.
    <br>The life you live is what moves you into Jesus’ name.
    <br>That is, in line with God’s Word.
    <br>It ushers us into calling Jesus.
    <br>You believe so much in majority, not God’s authority.
    <br>Create time for yourself to meet God.
    <br>You must cultivate this habit to meet God.
    <br>Talk to Him, even though at the beginning it is like, "whom am I talking to? I don't hear from Him.
    <br>It is only me who is talking".
    <br>I stop when I want to stop, and not when He wants me to stop.
    <br>I can't hear, I don't know whether He hears me.
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>Yes, it will start like that to show your genuine willingness.
    <br>Everything starts outside reality.
    <br>But when it starts with truth and faith, you begin to enter reality.
    <br>Look at what happened to Peter and Jesus.
    <br>Jesus was on the sea; Peter said, "I want to come to You".
    <br>Jesus said, "You want to come to Me? OK, come".
    <br>Outside reality, he started walking on his own power on the sea.
    <br>Jesus was looking at him, "I want to see your genuine willingness. If you are genuine, I will come into the matter".
    <br>How do we test genuineness?
    <br>We test genuineness through challenges.
    <br>If your faith is not tested, it’s not real faith.
    <br>Our faith must be tested.
    <br>That is why we call it, ‘faith’.
    <br>Don’t be like Jesus in your body but in your heart; in our heart, we are like Jesus.
    <br>With your track record - it is enough not to be deceived.
    <br>You should be able to know what is right and what is wrong, when it comes to the issue of God.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Ask the Holy Spirit of Truth to reveal Jesus to you.
    <br>The Spirit of Truth, Holy Spirit, reveal Jesus to me!
    <br>This is Spirit prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Spirit of Truth, Holy Spirit, reveal Jesus to me!
    <br>Ask Him to help cleanse all your wrongs.
    <br>Help cleanse all my wrongs in action, thoughts and deeds – knowingly and unknowingly.
    <br>Open your lips, help cleanse all my wrongs.
    <br>... you cannot mention.
    <br>Viewers, ask the Holy Spirit to reveal Jesus to you.
    <br>Make my heart a contact point.
    <br>Holy Spirit, reveal Jesus to me.
    <br>Do the introduction, Holy Spirit!
    <br>Do the engagement, Holy Spirit!
    <br>Align me, Holy Spirit!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Cleanse all my wrongs in action, thoughts and deeds – knowingly and unknowingly.
    <br>Make it happen, in Jesus’ name!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Open your lips, pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Pray the character...
    <br>Viewers, pray the character of the Holy Spirit into your life.
    <br>Be the Spirit of adoption to me, Lord!
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name, we pray.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Make it happen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>You have so many talents.
    <br>Many of us here know that they have talents.
    <br>You have gifts.
    <br>Being very intelligent but nothing...
    <br>Your time seems to be a waste, anywhere you go.
    <br>Some talents are dormant.
    <br>Nobody calls for your talent, nobody asks of you.
    <br>Many are working under those who are dormant and can't offer anything.
    <br>It is your talent they are using, but you are working under them.
    <br>Open your lips, ask God to help you serve Him with all your talents.
    <br>If Jesus helps you, royals, princes, kings, queens will discover your talent.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Open your lips and ask God, “Help me to serve You with all my talents”.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Help me to serve You with all my talents, time, money and labour of love – help me, Lord!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name, we pray.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Lord, make it happen!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Make it happen!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Make it happen!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>There are many talented ones but their talent seems to be dormant.
    <br>No one, no king, no queen, no people call for it.
    <br>Lord, make it happen!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>You are gifted; the gifts are dormant.
    <br>You need revelation.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>You need what?
    <br>(Revelation.)
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Say it.
    <br>(Meditation brings revelation.)
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>(Meditation brings revelation.)
    <br>Begin to meditate on the Word.
    <br>Begin to meditate on the Word – without stopping; without ceasing.
    <br>Begin to meditate on the Word – turn it over and over and over in your heart.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Lord, make it happen!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>You know – when your talent and gift is honoured, joy comes.
    <br>Every God's general in the Bible - their talent was revealed to the king and queen.
    <br>Lord, make it happen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Make it happen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Open your lips right now and begin to confess your freedom.
    <br>Make it happen, Lord!
    <br>Make it happen!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Make it happen!
    <br>Reveal my talent and gift.
    <br>Usher me to the kings and people that need me.
    <br>Make it happen!
    <br>Begin to break the chain – any chain that is holding you, your talent and gift; break it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This is an area the Lord said I should begin to touch before the new year.
    <br>You need to discover yourself.
    <br>(Amen.)
    <br>There are many kings, queens, people that need you but there is a chain, barrier between you and them.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "There are many kings, queens, people that need you but there is a barrier".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>But you keep praying for money and prosperity.
    <br>What kind of prosperity is that when there is a barrier?
    <br>What you need is more than prosperity and money.
    <br>There is a barrier between you and people who need you, your services, gift and talent.
    <br>There is a barrier.
    <br>The barrier is simply the wall between you and God -
    <br>a relationship must be established between you.
    <br>There is no one without gift and talent – you are created with your talent and gift.
    <br>These gifts and talents will usher you to the kings, nations and queens.
    <br>Today, the opposite is the case.
    <br>Talented people have now turned to beggars.
    <br>Whatever barrier between you, begin to break that barrier right now!
    <br>Open your lips and break the barrier!
    <br>Break the barrier!
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name, we pray.
    <br>(Amen.)
