    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>There are some forces that are disturbing you.
    <br>You know you love Jesus.
    <br>There is a force that seeks to fight you.
    <br>You know what you have gone through before coming here.
    <br>There are forces that seem to stand against everything that has to do with your destiny.
    <br>The same forces will bring nightmare, infirmity - which is any sickness, any disease that gives you nightmares.
    <br>Either in your blood, wherever it is located -
    <br>you disease, you sickness, you infirmity, I command you to leave my people!
    <br>I say to you infirmity, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You sickness, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You disease, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You disease, you sickness, in the name of Jesus, leave my people!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>Open your lips and begin to rebuke it.
    <br>Live Insect Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>It is coming from the vomit.
    <br>Live Insect Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>My name is Vivian Burume. I'm from Nigeria and I live in Mali.
    <br>The problems that brought me to The SCOAN today are many,
    <br>but the main problem that brought me here is my stomach.
    <br>Any time I sleep, I dream about snakes.
    <br>In 2007, I gave birth to a child and the child died; I cannot give birth.
    <br>There are moving objects in my stomach.
    <br>When the man of God was praying, I vomited an insect.
    <br>Now I am okay.
    <br>Do you have any more stomach pains?
    <br>No, I am okay.
    <br>I can press my stomach now. I had an operation before and I could not press it.
    <br>Now, I'm free!
    <br>You had an operation?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But now, I'm okay, after vomiting.
    <br>These are the major things that cause operations.
    <br>By the time they do the operation, they will not see them.
    <br>Things like this were commanded inside.
    <br>The Holy Spirit will also command it out.
    <br>As the evil spirit commanded it inside, the Spirit of God commands it out.
    <br>Live Insect Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>When you open the stomach you cannot see it.
    <br>Live Insect Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>Can you see inside that vomit? Let's see.
    <br>From here, when the lady vomited, we saw that object was moving out of the vomit and it was moving away from it.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Vivian Sunday. I am from Nigeria, but I came from Mali.
    <br>Good Morning, church!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I am here to testify of the goodness of God.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was my stomach; it was disturbing me.
    <br>Last week Sunday when I was here, the man of God touched people but he did not touch me.
    <br>I started crying, asking why the man of God did not touch me.
    <br>Then, he said he wanted to start Mass Prayer for everybody.
    <br>When the Mass Prayer started, I was not happy.
    <br>I said that since the man of God did not touch me, I would sit down and cry.
    <br>While he was praying, I was sitting down crying.
    <br>He said, "Anything inside your body, pain hiding inside your body, any disease, should come out".
    <br>I started hitting my stomach; that was where I had disease.
    <br>I said, "Any disease inside this stomach, out, in the mighty name of Jesus!"
    <br>In a short time my body started shaking. I couldn't hold myself and started vomiting.
    <br>Before I knew it, I saw an insect coming out with my vomit.
    <br>The man of God said they should look inside the vomit; that something came out of me in the vomit.
    <br>Truly, when they looked, they saw an insect moving in the vomit; it was not dead.
    <br>It came out through my mouth; while vomiting, it came out.
    <br>It was walking inside the vomit. It was not dead while it was inside my body.
    <br>That is the testimony I came to give today because I am delivered.
    <br>Live Insect Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>We rejoice with you because God Almighty has indeed transformed your life.
    <br>And today you are a living testimony.
    <br>We thank God for your life.
    <br>The man of God made mention of something.
    <br>He said that live insect was commanded into your body. Can you explain this to us?
    <br>That prophesy is true because I am a Nigerian and I sell fuel in Warri, Delta State.
    <br>One day while I was selling fuel, a man came and offered to take me outside the country.
    <br>When the man came, he said he was taking people outside the country.
    <br>I asked him what work he had outside the country.
    <br>He said he had a boutique. When we got there, we would work and he would give us a salary
    <br>until the money he spent in taking us there was repaid.
    <br>He asked about the house I was staying in and what I wanted to do with all my things.
    <br>He said I should give them away or sell them.
    <br>I sold some of them and threw the rest away.
    <br>When he asked me, I said I had never travelled and that I would like to go outside the country.
    <br>We entered a vehicle.
    <br>I had thought that when people travelled they flew in planes but we entered a vehicle.
    <br>Live Insect Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>It was a vehicle we used. When we got to Cotonou, he lodged us in a room.
    <br>He told us we should not go outside; that if we went for a walk, police would arrest us.
    <br>We were four in number who went with him.
    <br>We waited for two days while he processed our passports.
    <br>The following day, we entered the vehicle and left.
    <br>When we entered the vehicle, I asked him why we were not taking a plane.
    <br>He said that we wanted to travel through the back roads so they would not catch us.
    <br>We drove and drove.
    <br>When I watched movies, people who drove through country roads reached the destination.
    <br>But this road only led us from one bush to another bush.
    <br>When I asked him where we were going, he said I shouldn't worry, that we were on a bush road.
    <br>We continued driving for almost three days.
    <br>We entered a country; I don't even know the country's name.
    <br>When we got there, I asked him if this was the country we were going to.
    <br>He said that the country we were going to was still on the other side.
    <br>We were still going to enter another vehicle.
    <br>I asked him if the country we were going to had foreigners and he said, "Yes".
    <br>I asked him again if we were going to see foreigners and he said, "Yes".
    <br>We entered another vehicle and drove for five hours.
    <br>As we were driving, I saw a very big forest and holes in the road.
    <br>I asked him if we were going to pass that road and he said I should stop asking questions.
    <br>The second day, I said I could not be quiet, that I must ask a question.
    <br>He said after we passed this bush road, we would reach the place so we were quiet.
    <br>When we reached the place, they told us we were in Mali.
    <br>There was no electricity or water. The sun could kill inside the house.
    <br>There was no food to eat.
    <br>When we arrived, I asked him what work we were going to do there and where his boutique was.
    <br>He said there was no boutique.
    <br>I asked him if there was no boutique, what work was there? He said, "Prostitution".
    <br>I asked him if it was really prostitution and he said, "Yes".
    <br>I reminded him that he had told me it was a boutique. He told me not to worry, but bring him the money.
    <br>What could I do? I was already there.
    <br>He said I would do prostitution and I asked him how I would do it.
    <br>The first thing I asked him was how much it cost him to take us to Mali.
    <br>He told us it cost one million, two hundred CFA.
    <br>I turned back to see if he was talking to another person because the money was too much.
    <br>I asked how I was going to make it. He said I would use my body.
    <br>I told him I was too small. He said if I didn't pay his money, I would join them in the graveyard.
    <br>He said Nigerian girls and girls from other countries had filled up the country.
    <br>He said I should look at the place, that they were all prostitutes living there.
    <br>I told him since I was already there, what else could I do but join them.
    <br>The gold women wear, we were told they dug it from inside the thick forest.
    <br>The townspeople spoke French and their local language; they didn't speak English at all.
    <br>- The Malians?
    <br>- The Malians.
    <br>He told us we would follow them. They gave us a torch because there was no light.
    <br>They told us it was a solar torch that we charged in the sun.
    <br>When it was night, we would wear only our underwear and sit on the ground.
    <br>When the men came from mining, we would meet them.
    <br>They taught us to say 'come', 'wait' and 'sex' in their languages.
    <br>If the man agreed, we were told to massage his body before following him.
    <br>If he agreed to follow us, he would say, "Yes" and we would ask him "How much?".
    <br>Sometimes he would say, "One thousand five hundred or one thousand".
    <br>If he agreed, he would follow you into a house or tell you to go into the bush with him.
    <br>When I started prostitution, nobody followed me.
    <br>I complained that other people were working.
    <br>Because of that gold, many Nigerian girls and girls from other countries are being killed.
    <br>They use their blood to sacrifice for their gold.
    <br>Some would say they want to sleep with us overnight and we'd go to a waterproof house.
    <br>After that, they would sleep with me - sometimes five times or four times a night.
    <br>The sister was trying to explain that during this process
    <br>there are a lot of things that many girls experienced over there.
    <br>That most of the time, most of these girls were being used for rituals.
    <br>When I complained that I wasn't getting customers and no one was coming to me,
    <br>they told me not to worry, that they would take me to a witch doctor.
    <br>They gave me soap and a sponge.
    <br>When I used those for two days, on the third day I washed my body and private parts
    <br>and any man who saw me would come and meet me
    <br>or when any man slept with me, whatever I told him, he would agree to.
    <br>This would give me money so I could balance the brother's money quickly.
    <br>The soap he gave me to use did not work.
    <br>From there, the witch doctor commanded the insect into my body, into my stomach.
    <br>He said if it did not enter me, I would not have any customers.
    <br>Sometimes, I could not sleep because it would walk inside my body as if it were a snake.
    <br>After you used those charms?
    <br>Yes. Sometimes it would just stay in this corner as if it were a baby.
    <br>It would just move around and I would not feel comfortable.
    <br>Also, no man was coming to me.
    <br>I called the man and told him I could not do that work.
    <br>I told him that I remembered that I had done an operation on my stomach.
    <br>- Before you travelled?
    <br>- Before I travelled out of the country.
    <br>If I did not say that, I would have been there for 100 years and never come back home.
    <br>It would only be my grave they would see.
    <br>I went to meet the man I was working for.
    <br>I told him not to be angry, but that he should know I had done an operation on my stomach.
    <br>He asked me if I told the man that brought me before we travelled.
    <br>I answered that he did not tell me I was coming to do prostitution.
    <br>He had told me I was coming to sell foodstuff and he was going to give me a salary.
    <br>At that time, the man had travelled.
    <br>All the prostitutes were there; Nigerians were there and we were in a group.
    <br>Nigerians would go their way and girls from other countries would go their way.
    <br>All the Nigerian prostitutes gathered.
    <br>They all said that since I had the operation, I could never do that work
    <br>and besides that, I am an only child.
    <br>They said they should take me back to Nigeria.
    <br>They called the man and he said he was not in the country.
    <br>He said I should wait or they should transfer me to another bush.
    <br>The man said I should not go anywhere.
    <br>He said I should show how bad it was, like I was going to die.
    <br>So, I started walking like this.
    <br>When he asked me to stand straight, I would tell him I couldn't stand straight
    <br>because I was in pain and blood was rushing from my body.
    <br>After that, all the Nigerian girls donated money so they could bring me back.
    <br>Live Insect Vomited During Mass Prayer
    <br>They collected 60,000 CFA and gave it to me.
    <br>They said they should take me to a garage and pay for a vehicle to bring me back.
    <br>When I arrived in Nigeria, I said I would not go straight back to Warri.
    <br>I must come to The SCOAN for healing before I go home.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus.
    <br>My stomach was the reason why I came to The SCOAN because I couldn't sleep.
    <br>I always cried in the night.
    <br>I couldn't do anything.
    <br>Sometimes when I closed my eyes, I would see something and wake up.
    <br>It would be moving.
    <br>I was afraid to sleep at night, thinking I would see the things moving inside me.
    <br>Since last Sunday when the man of God prayed during the Mass Prayer,
    <br>and that night the insect came out of your body - you vomited it out - how is your body now?
    <br>My body is okay. I can do anything now and I don't have that sensation any longer.
    <br>I'm healed!
    <br>- Are you still having the moving objects?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- And now you can press your stomach?
    <br>- Well.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>We indeed thank God for your life.
    <br>We know that you did not only receive healing from this problem,
    <br>but you were also delivered from the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Finally, now you are delivered, how do you feel?
    <br>I feel better. I feel smart. I feel everything.
    <br>- Do you still have something moving in your body?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Nothing moving anymore in your body?
    <br>- Not at all.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus.
    <br>We thank God for your life and we believe you have a word of advice you want to give to young ones, ladies,
    <br>and most especially parents out there.
    <br>Parents and young ones in my age group,
    <br>if someone comes to tell you they want to take you out of the country,
    <br>look at them very well.
    <br>Where do they really want to take you?
    <br>Many of those who go, never come back.
    <br>They die over there.
    <br>Mothers, when your children say they are travelling, don't tell them to go because of money.
    <br>Don't allow your children to go because they will never come back complete.
    <br>That is the advice I have for mothers and friends.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together wonderfully for our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Our Lord Jesus has indeed transformed the life of our sister today.
    <br>As we have heard from her, she is advising the young ones
    <br>that they must be very careful when they hear people saying,
    <br>"I want to take you outside the country, I want to take you to this, I want to take you to that".
    <br>You must at all times examine everything you hear from people in the light of God's Word.
    <br>For parents, when your children tell you, "We are travelling",
    <br>try your best as a mother to find out where your children are going.
    <br>When you do that, you will be able to help them, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>We know that you are delivered completely today and you are healed.
    <br>We just want to advise you, now that God Almighty has set you free,
    <br>you must continue to honour Christ.
    <br>Follow Him, make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>and you must always choose your friends with care.
    <br>Always examine everything you hear from people in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Now that you are delivered,
    <br>we pray that God Almighty will grant you the grace to live the rest of your life to follow Him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>- Amen.
    <br>- Once again, let us put our hands together for Christ Jesus.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My name is Vivian Sunday. I am from Warri, Nigeria.
    <br>There have been many changes to my life since I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>You mean that your life has changed since your deliverance here
    <br>where you vomited this strange object during the Mass Prayer? Ever since then your life has completely changed?
    <br>Yes. I didn't have money. I didn't have work.
    <br>But now that you are delivered, you are not going to return to that?
    <br>Never.
    <br>We are here today with a message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua said that now that you have received your deliverance and you want to start a new life in Christ
    <br>that he wants to support you.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>we are here to present to you a cash gift of 200,000 Naira.
    <br>Praise the Lord! God, You are the God of Emmanuel TV and T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You have done wonders in my life.
    <br>I thank the man of God, T.B. Joshua, who has been instrumental in changing in my life.
    <br>God used him to deliver me and then gave me money. I give thanks and all the glory to the Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. We know that it is all about Jesus.
    <br>Once again, we can see our sister overcome by emotion and joy at this wonderful blessing she has received,
    <br>which we know is going to go a long way to change her life dramatically.
    <br>Not just the deliverance she has received, but also to be equipped financially to start a new life
    <br>as Jesus Christ has set her free.
    <br>Viewers, no matter what happens, don't give up in life.
    <br>Put your hope and trust in God and have faith in the Lord.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>We believe you are going to go now and use this money wisely and use it for the glory of God.
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus.
