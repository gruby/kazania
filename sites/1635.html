  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>How do we maintain this blessing?
    <br>That is the question that should be going on in your heart.
    <br>If you say your are not blessed, it means you are not here
    <br>and you are not under the anointing that is going on.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "How do we maintain this blessing?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour again.
    <br>[How do we maintain this blessing?]
    <br>That was going through my heart since morning.
    <br>I said, "Look. So much blessing."
    <br>And I can see everyone being blessed.
    <br>But the question remains: How do you maintain the blessing?
    <br>Because this is not the first time you received blessing.
    <br>How do you maintain it?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>Let's talk about it.
    <br>HOW MUCH WE NEED GOD
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's take a look at the Bible passage and see what message we have from this.
    <br>Take your reading from the Book of Luke 16; let's take verse 10 there:
    <br>"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much,
    <br>and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.
    <br>So if you have not been trustworthy in handling wordly wealth,
    <br>who will trust you with true riches?
    <br>And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property,
    <br>who will give you property of your own?"
    <br>We also look at the Book of 1 Corinthians 14: 15:
    <br>"So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding;
    <br>I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding."
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>What is robbing us of our blessing is simple.
    <br>We don't know how much we need God.
    <br>This is what is robbing our blessing.
    <br>How much we need God.
    <br>If you know how much you need God, you will always be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>As you are looking at me, you are supposed to be in an attitude of prayer, but you are not.
    <br>You want to see what will happen.
    <br>You are supposed to be running your spirit, your heart with the name, Jesus.
    <br>To run a vehicle with oil - you know what it means.
    <br>You are supposed to be running in your spirit, with the name Jesus while looking at me.
    <br>If you know how much you need God, you will always be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[If you know how much you need God, you will always be in an attitude of prayer.]
    <br>If you know how much you need Jesus, you will always be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>If you don't know how much you need Jesus,
    <br>you will always have a certain occasion for prayer.
    <br>Can you understand what I am saying?
    <br>When you don't know how much you need Jesus,
    <br>you will always have a certain occasion...
    <br>If you don't know how much you need Jesus in small things,
    <br>you will not know how much you need Him to settle your situation.
    <br>What is the small thing?
    <br>To walk is a small thing - these are the things you can do yourself.
    <br>To talk is a small thing.
    <br>To dress up is a small thing.
    <br>To laugh is a small thing.
    <br>To look is a small thing.
    <br>To hear is a small thing.
    <br>If you don't know how much you need Jesus in small things,
    <br>you will not know how much you need Him to settle your situation
    <br>such as affliction, hardship, career failure, marital challenges, stagnation, joblessness.
    <br>These are situations people are facing today.
    <br>Say after me, "If you don't know how much you need Jesus in small things
    <br>such as to walk, to talk, to look, to dress up, to comb hair,
    <br>you will not know how much you need Jesus to settle your situation
    <br>such as the challenges we have today.
    <br>Can you see where your trouble comes from?
    <br>You just believe that when you have a challenge
    <br>like affliction, business failure, nightmare, stagnation, depression,
    <br>then you pray to God, you run to God, you run to the prophet.
    <br>And you don't know; the small things - Jesus cares much.
    <br>There is no way you can get to the fifth ladder without starting from the first ladder.
    <br>You can't just jump to the seventh ladder, without starting from the first ladder.
    <br>Belief: "I can walk myself. I can talk myself. I don't need Jesus to do that."
    <br>These are the challenges you are facing today.
    <br>Constantly pray in our heart without ceasing...
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Constantly pray in our heart without ceasing...]
    <br>Is the way out.
    <br>You say you are a Christian without constantly praying in your heart without ceasing -
    <br>you are deceiving yourself.
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart without ceasing, in hymns, spiritual songs
    <br>and make melodies in your heart to the Lord.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your heart must be running.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Melodies -
    <br>to keep your heart busy.
    <br>The idle attack, negative thoughts, doubts.
    <br>As you are looking at me, if you allow your heart to be idle, something negative will come,
    <br>"Will this man prophesy for me today? Will this man see me today? I don't think he will see me.
    <br>My problem is solved - I'm still feeling it. What is going to happen? Why am I really here today?"
    <br>These are the things that are going on in your heart.
    <br>You have to keep your heart arrested - on your side.
    <br>Run your heart with the name Jesus.
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart without ceasing, in hymns, spiritual songs
    <br>and make melodies to the Lord.
    <br>This is the life I live.
    <br>This is why it is difficult for me to go to every occasion; I'm too busy.
    <br>And if I'm at an occasion, I'm sitting, I say, "What is going on? I need to be busy with my heart."
    <br>Hardly I can spend just an hour at any occasion.
    <br>But hardly you will see me where I'm praying.
    <br>Where will you see me praying when I pray all the time?
    <br>"I don't see the man of God praying..."
    <br>No, I pray all the time, I constantly pray in my heart without ceasing.
    <br>This is what Paul meant when he said,
    <br>"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
    <br>It means to walk, to talk, to dress up, to eat - all.
    <br>Are you doing all?
    <br>You are only seeking miracle.
    <br>You will never grow spiritually unless you take this step.
    <br>A break in prayer is a break in faith and a break in faith is a break with God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "A break in prayer is a break in faith. A break in faith is a break with God."
    <br>When you know how much you need God, you will pray without ceasing.
    <br>When you don't know how much you need God,
    <br>you will always have a certain occasion for prayer.
    <br>Where are we going from here?
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>You are not a Christian.
    <br>You are a part-time one, part-time Christian.
    <br>Brother, what is going on in your heart now?
    <br>Can you just tell me as you are looking at me?
    <br>I'm praying.
    <br>You can tell us what is going on in your heart.
    <br>I'm asking God to cleanse me.
    <br>- This is what is going on in your heart?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Without what?
    <br>Without ceasing.
    <br>- And sometimes you sing hymns, melodies, songs...
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you start this, you will see that your character will change, your attitude will change.
    <br>Your attitude will completely change.
    <br>So that is what you call prayer.
    <br>Prayer is the key
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Jesus started with prayer
    <br>And ended with prayer
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Are you telling me that a pilot that flies twenty hours in the air would not pray?
    <br>He would close his eyes and pray?
    <br>He would need to be shouting?
    <br>That is not what I'm talking about.
    <br>We don't know how to pray; the Spirit helps us in our weaknesses.
    <br>When I go on the street and see people saying, "In the name of Jesus"...
    <br>I was living in a certain place before and I'm a pastor - this one is too much.
    <br>No one in the community could sleep.
    <br>At midnight: "In the name of Jesus! Amen!"
    <br>I said, "What trouble is this?"
    <br>There was a time I woke up at midnight and I wanted to join them.
    <br>"Heal me! Heal me!" - I looked at the community and said, "How would they be sleeping?"
    <br>This is different company taking night duty and all other.
    <br>Poor man's prayer, "God" - all day.
    <br>They have no say.
    <br>And when you go to the police station and report it,
    <br>you don't know whether the policeman is an evangelist.
    <br>You move toward the policeman and say, "They are making noise there, saying the name Jesus".
    <br>"What?! I'm an evangelist! Are you crazy?!"
    <br>These are the embarrassments; you see the government started checking churches, noise
    <br>because we are going too far - that is not in the Bible.
    <br>They go to churches, give them letters to close the church because of noise pollution.
    <br>This is true.
    <br>That you are a Christian does not mean you will not face challenges
    <br>but the challenges we face do not offer us any alternative apart from faith in God.
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>No alternatives.
    <br>This is the issue with many of us here - looking for any alternative.
    <br>If there is any at all, it is a way of postponing the evil day.
    <br>You now are looking for earthly help.
    <br>What many of you are facing today is an issue you were supposed to tackle in the name of Jesus,
    <br>in the past, but you run to earthly help.
    <br>You are only postponing the evil day.
    <br>All the issues many of us are facing today - these are the issues we were supposed
    <br>to have faced in the past and tackle it; they are recurrent.
    <br>Earthly help has their own habit of disappointing one.
    <br>Hear what Jesus said to His disciples in John 14:27, "My peace I give you.
    <br>I do not give you as the world gives."
    <br>If God gives you something, there are no conditions attached.
    <br>If the Lord gives you something, there are no conditions attached.
    <br>In God you have peace but in the world you have tribulation.
    <br>This is why you see a lot of things happening; divorces, broken homes,
    <br>broken businesses...
    <br>When you look at how you got those things, the approach you gave to those things,
    <br>the direction, the source of those things - they are the ones...
    <br>Earthly help has their own habit of disappointing one.
    <br>Broken this, broken relationships, broken that...
    <br>At the time you need to settle down, at the time you need those things dearly...
    <br>At the time you need to rest and enjoy the fruit of your business, it collapses, disagreement.
    <br>Think back - you will know what I'm talking about; the approach you have given in the past.
    <br>Earthly help has their own habit of disappointing one in the time of need.
    <br>Where are we going from here?
    <br>This is why you see today those who had third class lower would occupy a better position,
    <br>while first class would live on the street.
    <br>It depends on the source;
    <br>how you acquired what you have is what works, not what you have.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Not what you have but how you acquire it."
    <br>The processing to achieve things is more important than the thing you achieve.
    <br>The processing gives value to the thing.
    <br>That is why today, you see all over the world - the owners of business, tycoons,
    <br>the richest men in your environment -
    <br>they don't have anything to show as a certificate;
    <br>you that have all the certificates, you are struggling to get a job with them.
    <br>This is why you must know how much you need God in small things.
    <br>Jesus cares dearly about the small things.
    <br>You want to comb your hair, you just... - you can do it on your own,
    <br>but when you have a headache, "Jesus, heal me!"
    <br>What of when you were combing your hair?
    <br>You don't need Him to help you to comb your hair
    <br>but you need Him to heal your affliction.
    <br>Crazy.
    <br>You can take your spectacles and wear it - you don't need Jesus to wear your spectacles,
    <br>but when your spectacles are broken and you need money to buy it, you need Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus. Have mercy on me. Let Your mercy speak for me.
    <br>Let the man give me money. Let me see the favour of the man."
    <br>Because you need money to get another spectacles.
    <br>These are the things that are affecting our spiritual lives.
    <br>What God has given you, the same God should also help you to maintain them
    <br>but you are now maintaining it on your own.
    <br>You are the one maintaining what God has given you.
    <br>You only need God for more of those things
    <br>but to maintain those things, you don't need Him.
    <br>You don't need God again to maintain what you have.
    <br>You need more from God but you don't need Him to maintain what He has given you.
    <br>We sing a song that says:
    <br>My head my shoulders
    <br>My knees my toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
    <br>You are lying.
    <br>You mean when you move, you say, "In the name of Jesus. Thank You, Jesus"?
    <br>If your knees, head, toes all belong to God, you should not use them without Him.
    <br>You should carry Him along.
    <br>How do you wear your dress?
    <br>How do you comb your hair?
    <br>How do you put make-up?
    <br>How do you talk?
    <br>How do you move?
    <br>Without God?
    <br>Rise up again and sing this song.
    <br>My head my shoulders
    <br>My knees my toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
    <br>So, you have hijacked it from God.
    <br>You are the one using it.
    <br>If you know it all belongs to God, when you want to move,
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" for allowing you to use them.
    <br>You want to talk, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>You want to wave, you want to greet, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Give glory to God for giving you.
    <br>You want to dress up, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Whenever you see me talk about Jesus
    <br>He is the owner of my soul
    <br>He is the owner 
    <br>He is the owner of my soul
    <br>But you are the owner of your soul now.
    <br>This is what is going on; you are the owner of your soul.
    <br>You do anything, you move without, "Thank You, Jesus..."
    <br>The word "Thank You, Jesus" settles it.
    <br>It is a way of saying, "Thank You for giving me. Thank You for helping me."
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" - acknowledgment.
    <br>So right now start this as you stand.
    <br>We are going to stand for two minutes - start it now
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace to continue what you have started.
    <br>Right now in your heart, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Start it.
    <br>If you know how much you need Jesus, you will always be in an attitude of prayer.
    <br>This is what Paul meant when he said, "I can do all things through Christ Jesus."
    <br>I can walk through Christ Jesus.
    <br>I can talk through Him.
    <br>I can dress up through Him.
    <br>I can make up through Him.
    <br>I can put on my spectacles through Him.
    <br>Through Jesus, do all things, everything and see what will become of yours.
    <br>Begin to do all things, do everything through Jesus.
    <br>You are about to enter a new year.
    <br>To have a new beginning, it is time now you begin to do everything through Jesus.
    <br>Walk and move around - "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Talk - "Thank You, Jesus," in your heart.
    <br>Put on your spectacles - "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Wave - "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Comb your hair - "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Start this, my dear brother.
    <br>Eat - "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Sit down right now - "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Stand up again - "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Clap for yourselves.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>That is it.
    <br>You have now started this - a big deal with Jesus.
    <br>A new beginning.
    <br>When we start praying now, as I offer that prayer -
    <br>before you repeat after me, say "Thank You, Jesus" in your heart.
    <br>If anybody calls you on your phone, before you pick it, say, "Thank You, Jesus"
    <br>before you respond.
    <br>And if you are making a phone call, say "Thank You, Jesus" before you talk.
    <br>It will help you to talk, to respond.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is effective prayer.
    <br>It is not this one you continue shouting, "In Jesus' name..."
    <br>You yourself will know that you are not talking to anyone, to heavenly Being;
    <br>you are talking to yourself.
    <br>The result of your prayer shows that you were talking to yourself.
    <br>You have been talking to yourself.
    <br>Right now, run your heart with Jesus.
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart without ceasing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again, "Constantly pray in your heart without ceasing."
    <br>When it is without ceasing, you will start hearing the voice of God.
    <br>The Spirit of God will begin to speak to you.
    <br>You can't wait to hear the Spirit of God speaking to you.
    <br>"Take more of me, give me more of You" - immediately...
    <br>If you start this now, it may be very difficult because you are more of yourself.
    <br>Anything that is not difficult at the beginning calls for concern.
    <br>You should expect this to be very difficult from the beginning.
    <br>If it is not difficult from the beginning, it means failure is awaiting.
    <br>You are more of yourself - it will be very difficult.
    <br>Even sometimes you will say, "In the name of Jesus. Thank You, Jesus..." - then you forget it,
    <br>and come back again, "I forgot what they asked me to do".
    <br>Yes, it will start like a practice.
    <br>As you go on and on, you have become integral to the Holy Ghost.
    <br>At the beginning it will look like a practice because you are more of yourself.
    <br>As time goes on, you will come back and give testimony.
    <br>This is what you need; that is the miracle you need.
    <br>You need that miracle of salvation.
    <br>There is no salvation without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Without the Holy Spirit salvation is fake.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Without the Holy Spirit salvation is fake.]
    <br>This is the kind of salvation you people have today.
    <br>People say, "I'm saved. I'm born again."
    <br>I look at them and say, "You are born again? Well done."
    <br>When you are saved, you will begin to relate with the celestial, immaterial world.
    <br>When you are saved, you will be going this way, you will hear the voice from your heart,
    <br>"Go back or wait."
    <br>A new direction, a new way, a new focus.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Immediately you are saved, the salvation comes to your life;
    <br>you will be going this direction, you just hear, "Stop" - from your heart.
    <br>And you will not be able to resist that - it is not possible.
    <br>If God talks to you, you cannot resist God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is what you are seeing today.
    <br>When I prophesy and say, "Somebody is there. You have this, that. You are bleeding." -
    <br>if you are the one, at that moment your heart will cease, until you come out.
    <br>That is why you see people with bleeding in public coming out.
    <br>They are ashamed but they cannot resist that instruction because it is from above.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How can a director, the chairman of the company, millionaire start vomiting in the public?
    <br>If he could resist that, he would want to go to the restroom to do that
    <br>but he cannot resist it; it is God who is working.
    <br>So when you are saved, you will be hearing a voice in your heart giving you instruction,
    <br>"This your friend - be careful."
    <br>By the time you greet your friend, you will say, "My friend, thank you"
    <br>because the voice tells you to be careful.
    <br>That's your dream - you dream 24/7, not when you sleep.
    <br>Your own - you must sleep to dream.
    <br>Salvation, fake salvation.
    <br>You don't need to sleep before you dream.
    <br>You may be eating with your friend and the voice will say to your heart,
    <br>"Don't take it. It is not good for you."
    <br>You will drop it.
    <br>And your heart is saying, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>But do you hear this?
    <br>You hear this?
    <br>If you had been hearing this, you would not have rebuked me in the past.
    <br>Maybe you think that I'm not born again.
    <br>The voice that was telling you that I was not born again then;
    <br>how come now you realised that I'm born again?
    <br>The voice that was telling you that T.B. Joshua needs salvation;
    <br>how come now you know that this man has salvation?
    <br>Fake.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is to attest, tell you that something is wrong with our salvation.
    <br>If you don't know your colleague, family of God, and you are a family of God,
    <br>definitely you are not a family of God.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>If you belong to the family of God, and you don't know one who is of the family of God,
    <br>you accuse him that he is not the family of God - definitely you are not family of God.
    <br>This is what is wrong.
    <br>Family of God is a light kingdom.
    <br>When we are there, we can see ourselves, we can know ourselves, we see clearly
    <br>that you are there, I'm there - there is a sign.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you suddenly realise that this man is a man of God,
    <br>that shows that your antecedent, track record in the past calls for question.
    <br>Here is T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I'm saying you are not a man of God, you are not a child of God,
    <br>but suddenly I say, "He is a child of God" -
    <br>that shows my journey in the past calls for concern.
    <br>If I now say, "This man is a man of God", you need to ask me,
    <br>"What was wrong in the past?
    <br>You could not see that this man is a man of God and you are now realising that he is a child of God."
    <br>Something is wrong somewhere.
    <br>But the wise today are quiet, they don't want to...
    <br>They remain silent, they don't want to talk again because they have realised they were wrong
    <br>and their journey in the past has been wrong.
    <br>The wise: "I don't want to talk again. I have wronged."
    <br>If you have wronged now, it means you have been wrong in the past.
    <br>I take it back again.
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart without ceasing.
    <br>Are you doing that now?
    <br>I'm expecting you to be doing it, while I'm talking.
    <br>It is not when you get home.
    <br>If you cannot adapt to it now, it means you cannot adapt to it again.
    <br>Start it.
    <br>When I say, "In Jesus' name" and you don't answer me -
    <br>it does not mean you have not answered; your spirit is connecting.
    <br>It is not:
    <br>"In Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen!"
    <br>Its manifestation is the answer.
    <br>When I say, "In Jesus' name" - the manifestation.
    <br>It is not when you say, "Amen!" - we are not here for national anthem.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>I take it back again.
    <br>Listen to me.
    <br>If you don't know how much you need God in your life in the small things -
    <br>to talk, to look, to greet, to eat, to do everything -
    <br>you will not know how much you need God to settle your situation.
    <br>This is why you call Jesus when you have trouble.
    <br>You will realise that you are just calling yourself, you are just talking to yourself
    <br>because you are doing things yourself.
    <br>You have to heal yourself too, you have to bless yourself too.
    <br>This is the issue.
    <br>God bless His holy name.
    <br>I want someone to come out, to address us, to tell us what are we talking about in summary.
    <br>Can somebody?
    <br>Praise God!
    <br>He says that if we don't know how much we need God in small things,
    <br>we are not likely to know how much we need Him to solve our situations
    <br>and that we should pray constantly without ceasing.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>The summary of it is:
    <br>We need God in everything in our life, in everything we do, anywhere.
    <br>- That's all?
    <br>- That's all.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>My brother says we need God in anything.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have learnt that I cannot be too high outside, if I'm not too high in the inside.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>That is, if you are not right within, you cannot be right without.
    <br>It is what is inside that manifests.
    <br>Clap for him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You don't know Jesus to walk but you want to know Jesus to heal.
    <br>You don't know Jesus to talk but you want to know Jesus to bless.
    <br>It is contrary.
    <br>You never had any certificate, you never attended nursery, primary, secondary schools,
    <br>but suddenly you have a PhD, and you carry a PhD certificate.
    <br>Does this not call for concern?
    <br>That is what we are saying here.
    <br>Jesus must manifest in your work, the Holy Spirit must manifest in your talk,
    <br>must manifest in your eating, must manifest in your dressing up,
    <br>before you can say, "Be healed! Be delivered! Be blessed!"
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I will be very happy, if you take this instruction.
    <br>Very, very important.
    <br>Not only you taking this instruction - get home, call your children, call your family,
    <br>educate them about Jesus.
    <br>Please, take it.
    <br>This is why we have faith bracelets for many of us to help them on the outside.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>With all your heart.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Hallelujah
    <br>Thank You Jesus
    <br>If your life depends on knowing Jesus,
    <br>you have to take every proper means to start this instruction.
    <br>As you move, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You can't count how many times... take it as a duty.
    <br>You enter a vehicle, "Thank You, Jesus", the conductor is saying, "How are you?" -
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus" in your heart, if your life depends on knowing it.
    <br>This is the life I'm living
    <br>and those things are manifested in my life.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>If you just tap me at the back while I'm moving, before I turn, I will say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Look at your dream - all the time you have nightmares, attacks in the dream,
    <br>people will carry guns to shoot you.
    <br>Instead of you to say "Thank You, Jesus", you say...
    <br>Is that "Thank You, Jesus"?
    <br>Many of you are inside the vehicle that is about to somersault.
    <br>Inside of it...
    <br>because you are not used to that.
    <br>If I'm going and I hit my leg on the nail or whatever, "Thank You, Jesus" - this is what I'm saying.
    <br>Everything - "Thank You, Jesus" - I know He is in control.
    <br>When you call me, "T.B. Joshua!", before I answer, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>He is in control.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Total submission to His will!
    <br>- Your name, sir?
    <br>- Joseph.
    <br>- Joseph?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>He is not saying, "Thank You, Jesus", He has answered already.
    <br>Can you see? After he said, "Yes, sir", he said, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>- Your name, sir?
    <br>- Solomon.
    <br>I said "Thank You, Jesus" in my heart...
    <br>I can see.
    <br>- What can I do for you, sir?
    <br>- Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>So just be ready.
    <br>See it as a duty.
    <br>- Where are you going when you leave here, sir?
    <br>- I'm going back home.
    <br>You can see - clap for him.
    <br>You can see - he paused.
    <br>My brother paused before replying.
    <br>You know it is not that easy...
    <br>So you should learn to pause - tell your neighbour, "Learn to pause".
    <br>That little period is for Jesus.
    <br>Today you see people say...
    <br>Who is speaking? Is it God or himself? You can see it.
    <br>You have to learn to pause.
    <br>Clap for him again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You learn to pause.
    <br>At that time you are saying, "Thank You, Jesus"
    <br>because something can come to you by surprise, when you are unprepared.
    <br>Examine everything in the light of God's Word - tell your neighbour.
    <br>If somebody says, "What is your name?", you have to examine that
    <br>in the light of God's Word before you answer.
    <br>To examine it in the light of God's Word is "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>You want to walk, you take your leg; to examine it in the light of God's Word is "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Hallelujah!
