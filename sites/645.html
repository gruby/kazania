  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I want to start from the viewers.
    <br>Wherever you are, whatever situation you are in remember with God, all things are possible.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>With God, all things are possible.
    <br>Believe first and see.
    <br>Viewers, say, "I believe!"
    <br>I believe!
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[I believe!]
    <br>I can't hear you!
    <br>[I believe!]
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, viewers all over the world,
    <br>those of us under the influence of my voice, whatever situation you are in,
    <br>be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>I can see you being rescued!
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Are you sick?
    <br>Every dry bone - receive!
    <br>In your blood, fluids, tendons, bones, kidneys - receive!
    <br>Receive light!
    <br>Be revived!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers all over the world, wherever you are and whatever you are doing,
    <br>those of you that are under the influence of my voice - listen!
    <br>Jesus said, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>This means there will be some factors and issues that will challenge your faith.
    <br>It could be sickness, setback, affliction, persecution or temptation.
    <br>Right now I say to you, be delivered, in the  name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever factor, whatever issue that is challenging your faith - be delivered!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>He said to Simon, "I pray your faith will not fail".
    <br>What is good for Simon is good for you!
    <br>What is for Simon Peter is for you!
    <br>Whatever factor, whatever issue that is challenging your faith - be it sickness, poverty, hardship, worry,
    <br>be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Whatever factor or issue does not mean you are not a Christian.
    <br>Don't misjudge yourself because of challenges
    <br>by saying you are not a Christian because you have sickness, persecution
    <br>or whatever challenges you are facing.
    <br>Have faith in God!
    <br>Jesus is aware.
    <br>He said, "In this world, there will be tribulation. Cheer up - I have overcome".
    <br>Rejoice!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
