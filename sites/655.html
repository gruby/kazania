  <p>    
    <br>On Sunday the 22nd of May 2016, during The SCOAN Live Sunday Service,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua revealed a prophetic message regarding the United Kingdom
    <br>and called on them to pray for the nation.
    <br>These were his words…
    <br>In Jesus' mighty name we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Like I was saying, one of the issues I must talk about - they should pray for the United Kingdom -
    <br>because I am seeing some funny people in their country.
    <br>So, they should pray for them - the United Kingdom.
    <br>But I am seeing with prayer and their proper security, it will be aborted.
    <br>But there will be a sign and there will be a trace that this happened.
    <br>It will not happen the way it was supposed to have happened.
    <br>But they will know something happened there.
    <br>They have to pray with proper security.
    <br>Funny people are there as I am talking now.
    <br>So, raise your voice and pray for the nation.
    <br>Innocent soul.
