    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua At Paul And Silas' Prison in Philippi, Greece
    <br>The Lord said we should use here as a point of contact to pray for you and pray for the nations.
    <br>Anywhere you are right now, be with me by faith and receive.
    <br>By the covenant Word in my heart, I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Just as Paul and Silas were released, be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, be it sickness, hardship, poverty, affliction,
    <br>isolation, rejection, depression, just name them -
    <br>By the covenant Word in my heart, I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Here – a spiritual monument.
    <br>What you have read in the Bible about Paul and Silas, how they were imprisoned -
    <br>this is not just historic; it is real. Indeed, a place of the Bible, the land of the Bible.
    <br>Here we are.
    <br>Paul and Silas were released by the Word in their heart.
    <br>The Word in their heart became the key that opened the prison gate.
    <br>Be Thou in my heart – release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever way you might have been connected to satan, to demons by way of poverty,
    <br>sickness, disease, isolation, depression, unbelief – I disconnect you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be set free!
    <br>I speak to the nations all over the world.
    <br>Troubled nations, in whatever area you are troubled, at war against one another, disunity,
    <br>hatred around the world, whatever way you, troubled nations,
    <br>trouble – I command you cease, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I send a Word to my nation, you trouble, cease, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I loose you, in the name of Jesus, from all troubles you are facing.
    <br>I say to you, you trouble, be thou loosed!
    <br>I release you from sickness and diseases, affliction – whatever!
    <br>The Bible said Paul and Silas prayed to God to comfort and support them in their trial.
    <br>Be comforted, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever area of your life, be comforted, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive strength to go on and on.
    <br>Receive strength!
    <br>In your nation, receive strength!
    <br>I pray for you all that are with me in Spirit.
    <br>This is Paul and Silas’ prison.
    <br>It is in the Bible, if I may read in the Acts of the Apostles.
    <br>Acts 16:25 - ”About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God,
    <br>and the other prisoners were listening to them.
    <br>Suddenly, there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken.
    <br>At once, all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose.”
    <br>Right now, chain of poverty, isolation, sickness, disease -
    <br>everyone’s chains right now, come loose, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I release you from every chain.
    <br>Chain of poverty, isolation, whatever way he might have connected you to himself,
    <br>come loose, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I break the chain, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can hear the chain loosing.
    <br>I can hear the noise of the chain loosing.
    <br>Be loosed, in the name of Jesus! Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>By covenant Word, I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>It’s as if I should not leave here because I can feel the presence of God.
    <br>I feel the presence of God more than ever before.
    <br>I want you to feel what I am feeling; the presence of God is all over!
    <br>The atmosphere is quite awesome.
    <br>There is so much trouble in the world: Family trouble, nation trouble, community trouble.
    <br>These are synonymous to satan.
    <br>Satan uses those things to connect people to himself.
    <br>I break that connection.
    <br>The word it uses here is clear.
    <br>Acts 16:26 – “At once, all the prison doors flew open and everyone’s chains came loose.”
    <br>Whatever way satan might have connected you, whatever way satan might have dealt with you,
    <br>whatever way satan must have related with you, like I said, he is synonymous to trouble,
    <br>sickness, disease, affliction, isolation, barrenness – just name whatever -
    <br>all these troubles all over the world – satan is synonymous to them.
    <br>He is the architect; he is the manufacturer.
    <br>He produces them.
    <br>Satan and trouble.
    <br>Satan and affliction.
    <br>Satan and violence.
    <br>Satan and disease.
    <br>Satan and affliction, just name them – I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Just like everyone here in the Bible.
    <br>Like it is written here, in Paul and Silas’ prison.
    <br>Acts 16:26 – “At once, all the prison doors flew open and everyone’s chains came loose.”
    <br>Everyone’s chain, under the influence of my voice, come loose, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be disconnected!
    <br>I disconnect you from satan and all his evil, sickness and diseases, attacks, trials, affliction.
    <br>I disconnect you right now from all these, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Acts 16:27 – “The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he draw his sword
    <br>and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.”
    <br>It is just a place we are talking about.
    <br>Viewers – I want to leave you.
    <br>Everyone under the influence of my voice, wherever you are, whatever you are doing,
    <br>see – I release you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Come loose, you chain! Come loose, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Loose, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever way satan might have connected you, be loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>He is synonymous to trouble, sickness, disease and affliction.
    <br>Become loose! I loose you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I separate you, right now!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank you, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you once again.
    <br>I want to ask you, have you made to Heaven?
    <br>It is not too late.
    <br>You just have to surrender; give your life to Jesus!
    <br>Say, Lord Jesus, come into my heart today. Wash me with Your precious blood.
    <br>Save my soul.
    <br>You are the only One that can save my soul.
    <br>You are my Redeemer, Healer, Deliverer.
    <br>Thank You Lord, in Jesus Christ name. Amen.
    <br>Thank You Lord.
