    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Viewers, get ready for a time of prayer with Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and catch the fire of the Holy Ghost anywhere you are, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Everyone messes up.
    <br>In the midst of setback, people need hope.
    <br>And sometimes, we all hunger for meaning in our lives.
    <br>Everyone thinks about this.
    <br>Prayer is a salve to every sore; a remedy to every malady.
    <br>So, open your heart to God's Word.
    <br>Open your heart to God's faith.
    <br>Open your heart to God's Spirit.
    <br>As you touch your screens and pray, you are sailing over life's obstacles.
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>I don't care where you are
    <br>or how big a mess your life has been -
    <br>begin to dream again!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to dream again!
    <br>I prophesy to your life
    <br>God has positioned you
    <br>in this New Year.
    <br>God has positioned you for breakthrough in this New Year.
    <br>God has positioned you in this New Year for victory,
    <br>for healing, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>God has positioned you to achieve your destiny, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Your limitations are your opportunities!
    <br>Your mess is your opportunity in this New Year, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Dream again!
