  <p>    
    <br>My name is Erasto and I am from Arusha, Tanzania.
    <br>This is the first time I am visiting The SCOAN, by the grace of God, and I am very happy to be here.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I come from a humble family who have suffered as a result of poverty, which was very tough.
    <br>We were eight children living in the village, and things like education and so on were not good.
    <br>By the grace of God, I met different people in my life who supported me
    <br>and helped me to get to where I am today.
    <br>Can you tell us what job were you doing before, the position you held and for what period of time?
    <br>I was a normal tour guide.
    <br>I worked at Serengeti, Ngorongoro and different national parks in Tanzania.
    <br>So, I was just a normal guide.
    <br>As a tour guide, what did you do?
    <br>For people to be able to understand, what did you do as a tour guide in the safari?
    <br>I took people around to show them the wildlife.
    <br>I took them on walking safaris in different national parks to see the wildlife up close and personal.
    <br>I also took tourists on game drives to show them the different animals in the national parks.
    <br>I had been doing that for twelve years for one of the companies in Tanzania.
    <br>For the twelve years, can you tell us what was the condition of life, what were you passing through?
    <br>I used to get a salary,
    <br>but there was nothing I could do with my salary because my family, my children and my relatives were always sick.
    <br>It was not enough.
    <br>I had been doing this for many years.
    <br>I was drinking, I was not born again and was living a wayward life.
    <br>There was nothing moving in my life.
    <br>One day I met a Muslim man who installed dishes for access to television channels.
    <br>So I asked him to install a dish at my house so that I could watch the different channels clearly.
    <br>He came and asked me whether I would like him to install Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I asked him, "What is Emmanuel TV?".
    <br>He told me that it was a Gospel or Evangelical channel based in Nigeria.
    <br>I told him that he could go ahead, so he installed Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Through that man you heard about Emmanuel TV for the first time?
    <br>Exactly. That was the first time I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>As I started watching Emmanuel TV with my family, I started listening to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I was so interested in the teachings and deliverances that I started watching it every day.
    <br>Sometimes I was so focused on watching Emmanuel TV that I did not go anywhere.
    <br>Previously, I used to have bad dreams where I slept and ate with women in my dreams.
    <br>But those dreams started to disappear and I started seeing Prophet T.B. Joshua in my dreams.
    <br>One day Prophet T.B. Joshua told me in a dream that he saw me being blessed with a job in my current field.
    <br>It was a very clear message.
    <br>Since I started watching Emmanuel TV, my life started to change slowly.
    <br>One day I was scheduled to work at Serengeti, as usual -
    <br>I usually worked there for six weeks, followed by two weeks of leave.
    <br>So, I went to Serengeti.
    <br>I was on my way to the airport to collect my guests as a normal tour guide,
    <br>and I met a Dutch couple who told me that they would like to see cheetahs -  the fastest animals in the world.
    <br>I told them that this would not be a problem as I had seen two cheetahs on a rock while I was driving to the airport.
    <br>They told me that when I showed them a cheetah I would be a star.
    <br>You mean, the couple you are talking about came all the way from the Netherlands?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And after moving around and seeing different animals in the safari, they made a special request to see a cheetah.
    <br>That if you could show them a cheetah, their dream of coming to Africa would be fulfilled
    <br>and you would become a star?
    <br>- Exactly.
    <br>- That is what they told you?
    <br>Yes. The day before, they were from another camp and had not seen cheetahs the whole day.
    <br>I asked them what they would like to see; what I should show them?
    <br>That was when they said that they would like to see a cheetah, and when I did that I would be a star.
    <br>It was a joke with the guests and we would go along with them.
    <br>I took them to where I saw the cheetahs previously and they were so happy, saying, "Erasto, you are a star".
    <br>I then took them to the lodge and gave them the programme for the following day.
    <br>The next day we were having drinks while watching the sun go down and
    <br>they asked me how long I had been working there.
    <br>I told them that I had been working for twelve years as a guide.
    <br>They asked me what I wanted to do in my life.
    <br>I told them that I would like to have my own business.
    <br>They asked me, "What kind of business?".
    <br>I told them a safari business, as this is what I had been doing.
    <br>Prior to this time, had you ever thought of having your own business while you just an ordinary tour guide in the safari?
    <br>Did you think of having your own business? How did this all begin?
    <br>It was not possible before,
    <br>but when I started watching Emmanuel TV, that is when I started to have an urge to have my own business.
    <br>One day I told my wife that I wanted to have a safari company and wanted to be a director.
    <br>My wife looked at me as though I was crazy.
    <br>I told her, "No, I am not crazy. I mean it",
    <br>because the situation was not really good where we lived.
    <br>You know when I say 'situation' ...
    <br>I started to look for the name of my company - this is before I met my partner.
    <br>I was wondering, "What kind of name should I use for my company?".
    <br>Then the Holy Spirit told me to watch Emmanuel TV
    <br>and I saw "More on others; less on ourselves".
    <br>Every day I had been watching Emmanuel TV, seeing what Prophet T.B. Joshua was doing
    <br>to support the less privileged.
    <br>I decided that the name should be derived from "More on others; less on ourselves".
    <br>So, I decided to call it, "Less on ourselves; more on others", which is "Lomo", and that was the name.
    <br>Shall we clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>You can see where the brother got the inspiration for the name of a business
    <br>that in his wildest dreams would not even happen.
    <br>But because he started watching Emmanuel TV and seeing and listening to the messages of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>he got inspired to think of having his own business,
    <br>even though his present condition did not suggest that he would have any small business,
    <br>let alone a very big business like that.
    <br>He was able to come up with a name 'Less on ourselves; more on others' - Lomo.
    <br>What happened after you got the name - before you met this couple that came from the Netherlands?
    <br>When you now met them and showed them the cheetahs and they invited you to a dinner, what happened?
    <br>So they invited me for dinner to talk further and they asked me whether I thought we could work together,
    <br>whether I could open a safari company?
    <br>I said, "Of course!". I was so excited.
    <br>They asked me how many safari vehicles I thought we needed to start with.
    <br>I told them that I had been watching Emmanuel TV and that Prophet T.B. Joshua was a very humble man
    <br>and that he had inspired me.
    <br>So I said, "Humble beginnings".
    <br>I told my partner that we should start with one vehicle so that I could understand the business.
    <br>Later he asked me why I didn't ask for five or ten vehicles.
    <br>I told him that I needed one to start off with to understand how the safari business worked.
    <br>He later told me that that was actually a trap and that he wanted to know whether I was serious about the business.
    <br>He thought that I would ask for ten to twenty vehicles to have a bigger company.
    <br>And that is how we started the business.
    <br>HOW A CHEETAH CHANGED MY LIFE!!!
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>Now ordinarily, with your condition at that time,
    <br>one could be over excited that someone wanted to help you to set up a business
    <br>and it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.
    <br>Many people would choose to demand for many vehicles - ten or twenty - a big mansion to start with and others.
    <br>What made you tell the couple that you needed just one vehicle to start?
    <br>And later he informed you that it was a test and you passed the test,
    <br>because he now knew your sincerity and your genuiness.
    <br>What inspired you to answer that way?
    <br>Ordinarily it is not possible, but I had been watching the life of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I also knew that God had spoken to me already in a dream through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I said that I needed to understand this business and start from little.
    <br>Because when you start from little, you grow up and it is for the glory of God.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>You, at that point, focused on the message from Prophet T.B. Joshua that we should always start little.
    <br>- Everything big starts little.
    <br>- Yes, exactly.
    <br>- And the answer you gave passed the test?
    <br>- Exactly.
    <br>From there, my partner told me that he was going back to The Netherlands and he would contact me.
    <br>One day he sent me an email saying that we were ready to start the business
    <br>and that I should find a lawyer that would take care of the legal papers.
    <br>Because I already had a name, I opened the office and decided to follow the procedure to leave my job
    <br>so that when I was ready, I would be in my office.
    <br>He sent me about 50,000 Dollars.
    <br>The biggest amount I had ever held in my hands was 1,500 Dollars.
    <br>Your entire life, the biggest amount you ever held was 1,500 Dollars?
    <br>Yes, as a guide.
    <br>But at this point, the couple sent 50,000 Dollars from The Netherlands for you to register the company?
    <br>Yes. That's when I started to look for a lawyer,
    <br>and by the grace of God, I appointed a good lawyer who helped me with everything.
    <br>After that, my partner sent another 200,000 Dollars to buy the vehicle.
    <br>HOW A CHEETAH CHANGED MY LIFE!!!
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>And remind us again the name of that company.
    <br>The name of the company is Lomo. It means 'Less on ourselves; more on others'.
    <br>Less on ourselves; more on others.
    <br>When your partner asked you the name of the company, what did you tell him and what was the reaction to that?
    <br>He asked me whether I had any name in mind.
    <br>I said, "Yes. It is Lomo, which means 'Less on ourselves; more on others'".
    <br>So he told me that it was quite a good name and asked me how I decided on this name.
    <br>I told him that I had been helped by different people and I also wanted to help others.
    <br>I also said that I had been watching the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>supporting the less privileged in his community, so that is how I got to my name, Lomo Tanzania Safari.
    <br>As he continued sending money, tell us how you established this business
    <br>and tell us what is the situation of the business today.
    <br>After he sent 200,000 Dollars for the business, he sent more and it is now a business.
    <br>By the grace of God, the business is growing.
    <br>We do safaris in Tanzania.
    <br>I have an office with staff in the office, as well as about five guides.
    <br>We are planning to expand the business, by the grace of God.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus one more time.
    <br>Mr Erasto
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>There are some pictures on the board. Can you please explain them to us?
    <br>This is a Certificate Of Incorporation for the business
    <br>and this is the licence for the business - you can see Lomo Tanzania Safari.
    <br>This is the licence to resume business. Without this you cannot do business in Tanzania.
    <br>So, this is the licence for my company and the Certificate Of Incorporation.
    <br>These are some of the staff.
    <br>This is my wife, my accountant, reservations official and this is me.
    <br>We also do gorilla tracking in Rwanda and Uganda.
    <br>These vehicles are part of the fleet that I have for safaris.
    <br>You can see that these guests are on safari, showing the typical safaris that we do.
    <br>You can see elephants here. Guests can see lions, elephants and other animals.
    <br>I also bought a car for my wife,
    <br>and of course I bought another car for myself.
    <br>And I will be coming for more testimony.
    <br>HOW A CHEETAH CHANGED MY LIFE!!!
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>This is my personal car, but I'm coming for more testimony.
    <br>This picture shows when you are on a safari.
    <br>After a game drive in the morning, guests are a little bit tired.
    <br>Around 9 am I stop somewhere and I lay a table with coffee, tea, hot chocolate and the guests enjoy themselves.
    <br>This one is used for pick-ups and transfers in Arusha to and from the airport.
    <br>That is the bus you use to collect guests from the airport?
    <br>Yes. This is the slogan for the company: A Journey That Changes Lives.
    <br>It means that when guests come on safari with us 5% of the money goes into a charitable organisation.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>HOW A CHEETAH CHANGED MY LIFE!!!
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>From just being an ordinary guide at a safari game reserve, now you are the owner of your own safari company
    <br>with a foreign partner and now the business is doing well with all the facilities provided. Right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, how does this make you feel? Compare your condition - a few months back and now.
    <br>What can you say? What can you say about Emmanuel TV?
    <br>I was nothing; I was nobody.
    <br>By the grace of God, praying with Prophet T.B Joshua on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>And also one thing: I was not able to come here to The SCOAN.
    <br>I wanted to come here for almost six to seven years, but I could not because of my finances.
    <br>I met a man in Tanzania and he gave me Morning Water.
    <br>So I had been using the Morning Water and had been praying with Prophet T.B. Joshua and my life changed.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>HOW A CHEETAH CHANGED MY LIFE!!!
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>I just want to explain more about the logo here.
    <br>The eagle in the middle carrying a fish - this is the aid that we give to the less privileged members of the community
    <br>through education and food, as you can see down there.
    <br>We also provide materials to the less privileged.
    <br>The yellow colour is the colour of hope.
    <br>When people lose hope, we bring hope to the people who lost hope.
    <br>You mean, since you started this business, God has blessed you
    <br>and you have also invested in charitable activities to help the less privileged? Right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>And all this inspiration came from what you saw on Emmanuel TV -
    <br>how God has been using Prophet T.B. Joshua to bless others?
    <br>Exactly. It is through Prophet T.B. Joshua - what he has done for the people on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>And I was inspired and have been doing the same to give back,
    <br>because I know that the hands that give are the hands that get blessed.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus.
    <br>HOW A CHEETAH CHANGED MY LIFE!!!
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>I would like to welcome Prophet T.B. Joshua to Tanzania and I would like to personally take him on safari
    <br>because Prophet T.B. Joshua enjoys sitting in the midst of animals.
    <br>I think you have seen that sitting in nature is much quieter.
    <br>I will be happy and humbled to welcome him to Tanzania.
    <br>My advice is to keep watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Distance is not a barrier.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for viewers, just touch the screen with faith and you will be delivered
    <br>and you will be blessed, just like me.
    <br>In my house, I never switch off Emmanuel TV.
    <br>In my office, Emmanuel TV is always on. Thank you.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank you for deeming it fit to come all the way from Tanzania for the first time to The SCOAN
    <br>to share with us this beautiful testimony
    <br>and we believe viewers all over the world are so inspired by your testimony
    <br>and what God Almighty has done in your life.
    <br>And many people are beginning to have hope that those whose hope is in Christ Jesus are not hopeless at all.
    <br>With what God Almighty has done in your life, we want to also encourage you that you need to maintain this miracle.
    <br>To maintain it is to live your life for the glory of God,
    <br>to continue to make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>Because the Bible says that those whose lives are centred in Christ Jesus, the best is always yet to come.
    <br>And as you do so, we are expecting you back soon with greater testimonies, in Jesus' name.
    <br>- Amen!
    <br>- Clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>BECOME AN EMMANUEL TV PARTNER
    <br>KEEP WATCHING EMMANUEL TV IN OTHER LANGUAGES
