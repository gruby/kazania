    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On 26th July 2009, during a Sunday live service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a call to pray for the nation Iran.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Pray for the nation Iran.
    <br>Please, open your lips and pray for the nation.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>On Sunday 6th November 2011,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave another prophetic message about the nation Iran.
    <br>He called for peace between the nations, specifically Iran and Israel.
    <br>He then called on the congregation and viewers to pray for God's intervention.
    <br>We should pray for a nation to nation.
    <br>There was a prophecy I gave - pray for a country, Iran, and other super nations
    <br>that crisis---
    <br>I said it three years ago.
    <br>It is very close now.
    <br>I want everyone to be on their knees.
    <br>We don't want crisis again; we don't want war again.
    <br>We don't want an attack again.
    <br>Whatever God will do to put an end to crises from nation to nation---
    <br>I'm seeing crisis between these countries.
    <br>Be on your knees and pray.
    <br>Ask God - we need peace.
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>It's close now - very, very close.
    <br>I'm seeing an attack. I'm seeing a fight between nation to nation.
    <br>Three years ago, I mentioned particularly Iran, that they should pray.
    <br>Pray for God's intervention.
    <br>God should settle every difference.
    <br>Ask God for intervention for that nation and other nations.
    <br>We don't want it.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Because the war is not going to bring solution to the whole world,
    <br>rather, crisis.
    <br>We want God's intervention.
    <br>God's intervention
    <br>In the whole world
    <br>God's intervention
    <br>We need God's intervention
    <br>In the whole world
    <br>God's intervention
    <br>In the whole world
    <br>God's intervention
    <br>We need God's intervention
    <br>In the whole world
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>We want God's intervention in whatever differences between nation to nation.
    <br>We pray for the nation, Iran.
    <br>We pray for the nation, Israel.
    <br>God's intervention in whatever differences.
    <br>Father, with You, all things are possible.
    <br>We know, to Your power, everything is possible.
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>Pray for God's intervention.
    <br>We know our God is able.
    <br>He is able
    <br>More than able
    <br>To accomplish what concerns
    <br>Me today
    <br>He is able
    <br>More than able
    <br>And He can handle
    <br>Anything that comes my way
    <br>He is able
    <br>More than able
    <br>To do much more
    <br>Than I could ever dream
    <br>He is able
    <br>More than able
    <br>To make me what He wants me to be
    <br>On Sunday, February 5th 2012, Prophet T.B. Joshua referred to the prophetic message
    <br>he had been speaking about for the past three years
    <br>concerning tension between the nations of Iran and Israel.
    <br>He then illustrated what would occur between the nations
    <br>if the tension continued and gave a call to pray for the whole world.
    <br>Last year, I reminded you of what I said three years ago
    <br>to pray for the nation Iran.
    <br>And I also said that I'm seeing tension between Iran and Israel.
    <br>I then said it last year, that what I was talking about was very close -
    <br>the tension of, I want to fight; you want to fight.
    <br>It's close; any moment from now, you will hear it.
    <br>And we all went on our knees.
    <br>Because if that should happen, it would be very serious,
    <br>more than any other one you have ever witnessed.
    <br>We went on our knees and we begged God.
    <br>But the prayer we offered that day, I know it will not go in vain.
    <br>Now, we'll follow the prayer.
    <br>They will continue to discuss, coming to a kind of compromise,
    <br>agreement and so on and so forth.
    <br>This will continue to drag until the full understanding comes.
    <br>But we should not stop praying because a break in prayer -
    <br>war will start.
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>This one will be different from others.
    <br>This is why we don't want a fight.
    <br>If this kind of fight starts, every other one you have read about is an atom.
    <br>This one will be an element.
    <br>You know atom to element - how big the size is.
    <br>So that is it.
    <br>This one is not an issue of fighting a country to country
    <br>but the whole world should begin to pray that this should not happen;
    <br>they should come to an understanding and dialogue.
    <br>Because if this thing happens, many countries will join in support of others.
    <br>Trouble has come.
    <br>And it will not be an issue of---
    <br>Come on.
    <br>I'm talking to you; you are talking to me.
    <br>It's between me and you.
    <br>I will not agree! I will not!
    <br>God should stop the two of us.
    <br>If not---
    <br>Come.
    <br>You want to support this man to fight me.
    <br>You want to support me.
    <br>You want to support this man.
    <br>Come. You want to support this man.
    <br>You want to support me.
    <br>What is coming?
    <br>World War.
    <br>Sit down.
    <br>PROPHECY FOR ISRAEL AND IRAN | Prophet TB Joshua
    <br>So, I'm talking to you in parables.
    <br>This is the only way I can say it.
    <br>So, this is why I said, it's not like others.
    <br>The whole scenario, it's not like others.
    <br>So please, we should be very careful all over the world.
    <br>It's not like others.
    <br>Others may just go; but this one, it will spread.
    <br>So please, dialogue, settlement.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Rise up for this moment.
    <br>I want us to bow down our heads and pray to God for peace all over the world.
    <br>Pray that the world should be ready to shift ground.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We pray that they should shift ground.
    <br>Shift ground means, "Leave the place".
    <br>"I said I will not leave."
    <br>"Well okay, I will leave this place."
    <br>Compromise means to overlook certain things to give chance for peace.
    <br>Every Monday from now, I want you to be on your knees in your home
    <br>and begin to pray for the whole world.
