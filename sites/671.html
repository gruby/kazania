    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On the first Sunday of the year, 3rd January 2016,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied concerning the currency crisis in South Africa.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>First of all, Southern Africa -
    <br>if I may talk to South Africa.
    <br>The currency that is going up and down
    <br>will soon be stable.
    <br>TB Joshua Prophecy On South African Economy
    <br>By August we'll begin to see
    <br>fading away of the challenges.
    <br>We often come out
    <br>of the challenges stronger.
    <br>The currency, the Rand, continues to top recent ten month highs.
    <br>It touched R13,20 to the Dollar today.
    <br>The last time the Rand was this strong was in October last year
    <br>before it weakened to an incredible R17 to the Dollar
    <br>towards the end of last year after ructions in the Finance Ministry.
    <br>The Rand has received a boost from the recent Election Results, as well as global factors
    <br>that are conspiring for a change in South Africa's favour.
    <br>Emerging market currencies like the Rand have been buoyed by investor interest
    <br>in investing money in financial markets with more attractive interest rates.
    <br>This has developed bond markets off a relatively low interest rate returns.
    <br>The other factor that's influencing improved emerging market currencies
    <br>is the expectation that the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise rates any time soon.
    <br>This has the effect of weakening the Dollar and in turn strengthening emerging market currencies.
    <br>Our currency is what they call a Purchasing Power of Parity.
    <br>Basically where you compare the cost of one good in one country compared to the cost in another country.
    <br>We show that the Rand has been too weak by 15% to 20%, depending on what measurements you have been using,
    <br>and this year we've seen the Rand get back to where it's meant to be valued.
    <br>So, I think it's more of a case that emerging markets last year were very out of favour.
    <br>The US last year was always guaranteed to be raising interest rates
    <br>and everyone was pulling money out of emerging markets, putting it into developed markets.
    <br>And now people are realising that interest rates going up is going to take a lot longer in developed markets.
    <br>There is almost no yield there, like you were saying earlier,
    <br>and emerging markets are now becoming more of a flavour again.
    <br>You're just seeing the money flow and I think that's what has been happening on the Rand.
    <br>With the Rand strengthening and oil prices declining,
    <br>there is a possibility that the South African economy could be further cushioned
    <br>by lower fuel prices in the coming months.
