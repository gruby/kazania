    <br>On 19th of September 2017 a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the nation of Mexico
    <br>causing the collapse of many buildings and resulting in 370 fatalities and 6,000 injuries.
    <br>The devastating earthquake left thousands homeless and desperate without water, food or electricity
    <br>and grieving the loss of loved ones that did not survive.
    <br>Moved by compassion, Prophet TB Joshua sent the Emmanuel TV team and partners
    <br>to the affected areas in Mexico to bring help to the helpless and hope to the hopeless.
    <br>Join us in this love work as we reach out to the people of Mexico, knowing that as Christians
    <br>we are called to respond to all human needs.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Earthquake Relief
    <br>Mexico
    <br>A magnitude-7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico on September the 19th, 2017
    <br>striking suddenly and leaving nothing, but destruction in its wake.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Earthquake Relief Team sent by TB Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners worldwide
    <br>to assist with the survivors and search and rescue teams who are racing against time to save lives
    <br>had arrived in Mexico city the day after the central earthquake.
    <br>The officers in the green uniforms explained that the first need was to transport some food and water
    <br>which had been donated to a local reception center to one of the emergency medical centers in the city.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV vehicles pull up and are quickly loaded with the fresh food, bread and water
    <br>for the emergency medical center on the other side of the city and as fast as possible
    <br>the team were off to deliver their precious cargo at the Medical Center.
    <br>Volunteers spring into action alongside the team to get them much-needed water and food to those who need it,
    <br>both those working in the search an -rescue mission and those being rescued
    <br>from the rubble of crushed buildings.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Team Transports Food And Water For The Emergency Rescue Center
    <br>While delivering supplies to the emergency medical center, the doctors there explained an urgent need
    <br>to send some medical supplies to one particular search and rescue zone
    <br>and they asked the Emmanuel TV team's help.
    <br>These are some of the supplies to be delivered to the wanting search and rescue zone -
    <br>medical fluids, medications, pain killers, neck collars, first aid essentials
    <br>and equipment for treating and dressing wounds.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Assists Doctors To Carry Emergency Medical Supplies For Search And Rescue Teams
    <br>Led by one of the doctors the Emmanuel TV team arrives in the search and rescue zone.
    <br>Getting as close as they can by car, they take the supplies and continue on foot
    <br>making their way through the  streets to the temporary store.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Assists Doctors To Carry Emergency Medical Supplies For Search And Rescue Teams
    <br>Everywhere you can see volunteers wearing masks and hard hats as safety precautions,
    <br>as they are organized into groups to help with the rescue work.
    <br>On arrival at the scene, the rescue workers were making arrangements to have light and generators
    <br>to enable them to work into the night, as the time is short for those trapped in the wreckage.
    <br>Several 20 litre kegs are purchased by the Emmanuel TV team and here they fill them with the necessary fuel
    <br>and return to the search and rescue zone.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Buys And Delivers Fuel For Search And Rescue Lighting Generators
    <br>The work was still going on strong as they carry the fuel into the building sites
    <br>where the generators were being set up.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Buys And Delivers Fuel For Search And Rescue Lighting Generators
    <br>Meanwhile, the industrial crane hoists a huge slab of concrete rubble away from the rescue zone.
    <br>But while the world's attention is on the capital city, many in poor villages in the south of Mexico
    <br>which were devastated by the even stronger 8.2 magnitude earthquake on the 7th of September
    <br>are still struggling.
    <br>So the Emmanuel TV team decides to make the long journey by road to Oaxaca state to lend a helping hand.
    <br>So having seen the plight of our brothers and sisters in Oaxaca state,
    <br>an Emmanuel TV team here in Mexico city is now preparing for the very long journey
    <br>carrying with us more than 500 boxes ready to be packed full of food and hygiene supplies
    <br>for the affected families down in Oaxaca state.
    <br>As TB Joshua has taught us:
    <br>"God blesses us not only that we may earn a living, but so that we are able to give".
    <br>The Journey From Mexico City To Oaxaca State
    <br>The Emmanual TV team has arrived here in southern Oaxaca state in Mexico,
    <br>the area which was devastated by the massive earthquake on the 7th of September.
    <br>The team is here going to collect and pack the food and the hygiene items into the over 500 multi-purpose boxes.
    <br>The families in this area in 3 different villages are waiting for help.
    <br>As TB Joshua has taught us: "Someone is waiting for you for a lifetime".
    <br>"Failing them is failing God."
    <br>Purchasing The Bulk Food And Hygiene Supplies From A Wholesale Warehouse
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team moves straight to a wholesale warehouse in the nearest large town in Oaxaca state
    <br>to pay for and collect the pre-ordered food and hygiene supplies for the earthquake survivors and rescue teams.
    <br>The warehouse crew used trolleys and forklift trucks to load the large pallets of pre-ordered goods
    <br>for the Emmanuel TV Earthquake Relief into the delivery lorry.
    <br>Purchasing The Bulk Food And Hygiene Supplies From A Wholesale Warehouse
    <br>This truck was provided by a local businessman to the Emmanuel TV team to help in the transportation
    <br>of the supplies from the warehouse to the affected areas.
    <br>The loading process begins - first with the large weighty pallets and plastic wrapped cartons,
    <br>then with individual boxes and cartons of supplies,
    <br>to make sure as much as possible can be contained in the trucks.
    <br>The process repeats for the second truck, stacking the items as high as they can go,
    <br>until there is no more space left.
    <br>Now loaded full of essential food and hygiene supplies, the Emmanuel TV team sets off on their journey
    <br>to Juchitán, where the aid will be distributed to over 500 families that have been affected by the earthquake.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Trucks Transport Food And Hygiene Supplies To The Temporary Logistics Centre
    <br>Arriving in Juchitan the vehicles enter the compound that will be used as a logistic center
    <br>to sort, pack and store the supplies for distribution to the needy villages.
    <br>Inside the base, Mexican volunteers assist the Emmanuel TV team to set out
    <br>the multi-purpose plastic boxes which will be given out one per family,
    <br>filled with the food and essential hygiene ítems brought from the warehouse.
    <br>While the colorful boxes were being set out, another group brings down the products from the trucks.
    <br>A last step before the boxes are filled is to decorate them with in an 'Emmanuel TV Disaster Relief' sticker.
    <br>These are the 500 boxes that will be given to families in the state of Oaxaca,
    <br>affected by the magnitude-8.2 earthquake.
    <br>Hello and good morning. We are here in Juchitan, in the State of Oaxaca,
    <br>in one of the municipalities affected by the earthquake of 7th September 2017.
    <br>As you can see behind me, we have here the food which will shortly be distributed
    <br>and packed into plastic boxes to take directly to those families with so much need.
    <br>Now the job of sorting out the different products and sharing them into the boxes begins.
    <br>Forming a chain the team swiftly sends the items along from the tables and places them into the waiting boxes.
    <br>The Food And Hygiene Supplies Are Packed Into The Over 500 Multi-Purpose Plastic Boxes
    <br>They start with some of the bulky items like storage boxes, paper towels and detergent
    <br>before adding tin foods cooking oil and other hygiene products. The momento note of encouragement reads:
    <br>"Remember that there is always Someone praying for you. You are not alone."
    <br>As we can see, the team is continuing to work to fill these boxes with basic food
    <br>and hygiene products that will be delivered to those families who are waiting for us.
    <br>Also Emmanuel TV has thought to reach these hearts and homes
    <br>with a small memento translated in the Huave language saying,
    <br>"Remember that there is always Someone praying for you. You are not alone".
    <br>After a good effort, the five hundred boxes have been filled with love and enough supplies
    <br>to make a big difference in the lives of those who will receive them.
    <br>The difficulties imposed by the powerful earthquake just over a week ago are still very much being felt
    <br>in the disadvantaged villages and areas of southern Oaxaca.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Boxes Prepared For Earthquake Victims
    <br>With everything ready at last the Emmanuel TV team sets off early the next day to two different villages -
    <br>first San Mateo del Mar, an indigenous seaside fishing community
    <br>and Chi Kappa de Castro, an inland farming community a little further north.
    <br>The level of devastation on the lower quality structures from the quake,
    <br>which was over five hundred times more powerful than the one which hit Mexico city cannot be hidden.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team At The Earthquake Damaged Areas In Oaxaca State, Mexico
    <br>My name is Jason nd my whole house fell down in the earthquake -
    <br>all our clothes are under the rubbles of the walls.
    <br>Material things do not matter; what matters is life and we are fine.
    <br>While many families lost their homes, their possessions and their livelihoods, some even lost their lives,
    <br>a bold sentiment from one so young but a sentiment that seemed shared among the villagers
    <br>who have already started doing what they can to pick up the pieces, clean up the mess the earthquake left behind
    <br>and get back to normal life again.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team At The Earthquake Damaged Areas In Oaxaka State, Mexico
    <br>Here the Emmanuel TV team is led into the homes of some of the villagers to see the extent
    <br>of what the earthquake did - heavy furniture lies where the quake had thrown them down
    <br>and large cracks may be seen even in the concrete floor.

    <br>Families Gather To Receive The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Relief
    <br>Families from the villages gather to meet the Emmanuel TV team and receive from them the much-needed food,
    <br>hygiene supplies provided as an expression of love and solidarity by TB Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>Everybody from grandparents to grandchildren happily form a line as the preparations are made
    <br>for the distribution to begin. From the chairs scattered around you can tell they have been expecting
    <br>the arrival of the team with some excitement and are glad of the good news
    <br>that someone has been thinking about them, and that some relief has finally come.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team sees it as a privilege to be in a position to help,
    <br>guided by the words of TB Joshua that giving is a real privilege, if it is done in a proper attitude.
    <br>Those who are strong enough, take the boxes themselves with a heat and a smile,
    <br>while the elderly or weaker members of the community are assisted by the volunteers.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Relief Boxes Are Presented To Needy Family
    <br>The grateful families express their thanks for the provisions, which will go a long way to meet their needs
    <br>in these trying times.
    <br>The team takes a moment to explain to this elderly woman the contents of the box she's receiving
    <br>and she nods with satisfaction.
    <br>The expression of their faces encourages those waiting on the line that it is well worth the wait.
    <br>More and more families receive the food and hygiene gift boxes and express both their surprise and thanks
    <br>for both the gift freely given and the hearts behind it.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Relief Boxes Are Presented To Needy Family
    <br>Many thanks to the organization that made possible this great gift
    <br>that the people of Chicapa really needed. Thank you very much.

    <br>Thanks for the support. The earthquake damaged our house
    <br>and many people have nowhere to live, nowhere to stay.
    <br>Thank you for the pantry.

    <br>Araceli Salomon
    <br>San Mateo del Mar
    <br>My experience in the earthquake is something horrible.
    <br>I could not go out with my children, I had to stay there locked up with my two little ones.
    <br>I believed that at that moment the house was going to fall down.
    <br>Everything began to fall down and all I could do was to hold my children
    <br>and give them refuge in my arms.
    <br>We just prayed and thanked God that He would cover and protect us.
    <br>Many thanks Emmanuel TV for this opportunity and for this support that you have sent us
    <br>here in the village of "Ikoots" people. Many thanks from my heart.
    <br>I receive this on behalf of my mother and I thank God for remembering us
    <br>and may God give you more.
    <br>It is hard for me to speak about it because I lost my father.
    <br>I thank God that you are here supporting us; many thanks and may God give you all long life.
    <br>Catalina Sanchez de la Rosa
    <br>Chicapa de Castro
    <br>Thank you Emmanuel TV!
    <br>My name is Jacinto Orozco Sanchez and I am with my family receiving this relief
    <br>due to the earthquake that we went through. It was a nightmare for us.
    <br>We give thanks to Emmanuel TV for this support, which for us is very significant
    <br>since in these times we are going through many difficult things.
    <br>The Villagers Gladly Taking Away Their Food And Hygiene Relief Donated By Emmanuel TV
    <br>Some families traveled quite a distance from the surrounding areas
    <br>and hearing that the Emmanuel TV Earthquake Relief team was coming.
    <br>Happily, they bought different vehicles able to return home with a degree of satisfaction
    <br>for their successful journey.
    <br>Others who live nearby take the stroll home proudly holding their gift boxes for all to see
    <br>and others wait in the shade for their transportation.
    <br>It is amazing to see the impact a simple gift can bring.  For love is a language that transcends all boundaries,
    <br>understood by both young and old alike.

    <br>Villager From Chicapa de Castro Explains Her Loss Of Livelihood
    <br>Leticia Lopez Orozco
    <br>Chicapa de Castro
    <br>I lost my pot and part of my house in the earthquake.
    <br>I was making tortillas for a living to support my children
    <br>because my husband is a farmer and he has almost no work,
    <br>so we were living from that with my five children.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team At The Earthquake Damaged Areas In Oaxaca State, Mexico
    <br>Emanuel Santiago
    <br>Chicapa de Castro
    <br>This project idea was born after the severe earthquake here in Chicapa de Castro.
    <br>Many families were left without a livelihood following damage to the ovens they used
    <br>for hand-made tortillas which are a local speciality product
    <br>that generates employment here in the village.
    <br>The oven basically consists of a large pot in which the tortillas are made,
    <br>first kneading them and then sticking them to the edges of the pot
    <br>at a high temperature until the tortillas are cooked.
    <br>We need one hundred new ovens to reactivate the economy of Chicapa de Castro
    <br>and one hundred families will benefit from this.
    <br>So the Emmanuel TV team has heard about the wonderful project which you're doing
    <br>to restart the economy here in the village of Chicapa de Castro by providing the pot oven liners,
    <br>so that people can start to make the tortillas and earn a living again.
    <br>On behalf of T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV partners we'd like to sponsor 100 of these pottery oven liners
    <br>and it would give us great pleasure therefore to present you with thirty-five thousand pesos
    <br>for the manufacture of the oven liners and for the transport.
    <br>Many thanks for this assistance because it is going to benefit many families here in Chicapa de Castro.
    <br>With all my heart, many thanks Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Thank you for your help with all my heart, Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The Location Of Santa Maria Del Mar Accessible Only By Sea
    <br>The next port of call was Santa Maria Del Mar,
    <br>a secluded village community accessible only by water. On the way to Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>the team traverse a rough track to the shoreline where the boats have been arranged to take the team across
    <br>to another area affected by the earthquake that has received little or no assistance at all.
    <br>The Departure Point For Boats To Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>Just as Jesus Christ himself is the solution to the problems of all mankind,
    <br>so He expects us to be a solution to someone in trouble.
    <br>This is a coastal area of Oaxaca state known as El Faro,
    <br>where the boats come to take people to a very remote and isolated village called Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>and the Emmanuel TV team right now is preparing to take boxes with food and hygiene provisions
    <br>to this isolated community.
    <br>The Loading Of Boats For Santa Maria Del Mar With The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Boxes
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team's vehicle reverses into a good position to allow the team to load
    <br>the precious cargo of food and hygiene supplies into the boat for transportation across the sea.
    <br>Everybody lends a hand to get the scores of colourful boxes
    <br>of much-needed supplies properly stowed in the boats.
    <br>The well-worn wooden slats make a good platform for wedging the boxes squarely into the boat,
    <br>so that they won't topple over during the voyage.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team forms a chain with the local fishermen to quickly pass the boxes into the boats
    <br>and as the saying goes: "Many hands make light work."
    <br>The Loading Of Boats For Santa Maria Del Mar With The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Boxes
    <br>With the boats loaded up, they are covered in a thick green tarpaulin to protect the relief boxes
    <br>and their precious contents from the elements. Finally, fastening the whole thing securely with strong ropes
    <br>the boats were ready to depart for Santa Maria Del Mar.
    <br>A light rain began to fall as the team pushes off from the shore.
    <br>The Loading Of Boats For Santa Maria Del Mar With The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Boxes
    <br>The fishermen navigate the beautiful, clear waters of the Pacific Ocean, as we head to the remote village.
    <br>In different circumstances the surroundings could make for a perfect holiday getaway
    <br>but after the violence of the earthquake, the isolation from the rest of the world
    <br>just makes help all the harder to come by.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team And Relief Boxes On The Boat Journey To Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>Traveling in tandem, the boats move as fast as the heavy load of cargo and passengers can permit.
    <br>To clear the vast expanse of water the shore leading to the village comes into view on the horizon
    <br>and the boats reduce their speed as they near the land.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team And Relief Boxes On The Boat Journey To Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>The expert fishermen maneuver the boats close to the shore to make a good approach for a safe landing.
    <br>Largely untouched the rustic setting boasts of only a few boats moored nearby.
    <br>As the first boat pulls gently onto the shore, the rain which had been their companion over the sea softens.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Arrives At Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>Unloading Of The Emmanuel TV Relief Boxes At Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>As the rain gradually dies down, the team once again form a chain
    <br>and pass the earthquake relief boxes quickly ashore stacking them high in the waiting vehicles.
    <br>Amazed at the effort of the team to reach the community
    <br>villagers are glad to assist in bringing the boxes out of the boats and loading them up.
    <br>Unloading Of The Emmanuel TV Relief Boxes At Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>Let's hear the experience of the night of the earthquake from one of the indigents of Santa Maria Del Mar.
    <br>Ciro Gonzalez Martinez
    <br>Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>On September 7th, at about 10:30 pm we felt like a roar from this Pacific Ocean.
    <br>It felt very strong; my family were going to sleep when the sea suddenly gave a great long roar!
    <br>Everyone panicked and at that time, we were looking for how to get out of the house.
    <br>We heard noise and children crying and many fences and houses had collapsed
    <br>but I thank God that nothing serious happened to us, even though we live in an isolated village.
    <br>At this time, we thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners for collaborating
    <br>and donating, for giving their heart to Santa Maria Del Mar; we are very grateful.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Journeys To The Village In Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>A beautiful blue hue has returned to the skies, as the Emmanuel TV team
    <br>are driven along the winding path to the village community.
    <br>On arrival, help is at hand to unload the relief boxes as quickly as possible.
    <br>Unloading The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Relief Boxes
    <br>For outside, word of the Emmanuel TV team's arrival, has traveled fast
    <br>and already a line of people has formed to meet them and see what is going on.
    <br>More and more large families come on foot from the corners of the region.
    <br>Despite the recent disaster, the arrival of the Emmanuel TV team brings with it
    <br>an atmosphere of joy and happiness.
    <br>Families Gather To Receive The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Relief
    <br>And the residents smile and wave for the camera, as they await the proceedings to get underway.
    <br>Even the children are happy at all the excitement in their rural home.
    <br>Just as in the other communities: one big box of food and hygiene items is given per family
    <br>with some assistance on hand to help the weaker or more aged members of the community
    <br>to carry theirs home with them. Grateful receiving like gracious giving comes from the heart
    <br>and the expression on their faces says it all:
    <br>Thank you, Jesus Christ for remembering us in our time of need.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Food And Hygiene Relief Boxes Are Presented To The Needy Families
    <br>As the families lined up, the Emmanuel TV team took time to speak with some of them
    <br>to hear what had happened to them and their beloved village during the quake. Let's listen to a few of them.

    <br>The day of the earthquake tragedy, was the day we thought would be our last day on earth
    <br>but thanks to God we are alive.
    <br>Thank you to Emmanuel TV for the relief box that you have brought us.
    <br>Azael Gonzalez Luis
    <br>Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>My experience with the earthquake was a very frightening night for me and my family.
    <br>I have two children - one is 10 years old, the other is 4 years old and my wife is pregnant.
    <br>On that day we were sleeping when the earthquake began.
    <br>The door got stuck and we could not leave the house.
    <br>I couldn´t leave my house and I couldn't do anything except have faith in God!
    <br>I thank Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua for visiting us,
    <br>traveling a very long distance to reach this village, which as you can see is in the middle of the sea.
    <br>Thank you Emmanuel TV for the relief boxes and for coming to give a moment of happiness
    <br>to the children, women and especially to the village of Santa Maria Del Mar.
    <br>Local Women Prepare A Community Meal With Ingredients Provided By Emmanuel TV
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team also provided ingredients for the community to have a big meal together
    <br>following the distribution of the food and hygiene relief boxes.
    <br>Women of the region joyfully prepare the feast together, some making the special tortilla bread
    <br>in the traditional way sticking the dough to the round oven like pots,
    <br>while on the other side of the kitchen a large vat of rice
    <br>dotted with colorful slices of vegetables is simmering away nicely.
    <br>This woman keeps an experiencd eye on some beautifully seasoned shrimp
    <br>stirring it gently, just a little while longer, and the celebration will begin.

    <br>Doesn't that look good? Big spoonfuls of rice are heaped upon the plates
    <br>with a generous helping of the chicken sauce.
    <br>Local juice is served alongside the meal to wash it all down with.

    <br>With a smile, the Emmanuel TV team takes delight in serving the people with a good hot meal,
    <br>while some groups serve out the rice,
    <br>others serve the tortilla bread and with healthy dollops of the spicy green sauce are local favorite.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team Shares A Meal With The Community In Santa Maria Del Mar
    <br>After the lovely meal and excitement of the day's event the children of Santa Maria Del Mar had this to say:
    <br>Thank you, TB Joshua for visiting us. We love you! Thank you, Emmanuel TV! Yay!
