    <br>Floors piled on top of each other.
    <br>We at Emmanuel TV and The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>express our deepest condolences to the government of Nigeria,
    <br>the government of South Africa, and the governments of other affected nations,
    <br>most especially the families, friends, and loved ones of the precious souls
    <br>who lost their lives in the tragic incident which occurred on Friday, September 12, 2014.
    <br>May Almighty God console all and give courage and strength to bear the grievous losses.
    <br>We pray that God's presence in our hearts and lives would more than supply their absence.
    <br>Death to a believer is his release from the imprisonment of this world
    <br>and his departure to the enjoyment of another world.
    <br>Those who are born from above long to be there.
    <br>Those who lost their lives in the incident died not in vain but as martyrs of the Kingdom of God.
    <br>As the Psalmist reflects, "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints" (Psalm 116:15).
    <br>God's everlasting promise is to comfort all who mourn, provide for those who grieve,
    <br>to bestow on them a crown of beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning
    <br>and a garment of praise for a spirit of despair (Isaiah 61:3).
    <br>Trouble may endure for the night but joy comes in the morning!
    <br>To all we greet you: Good Morning!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>God is with us!
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
