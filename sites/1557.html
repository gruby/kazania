    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>He is my husband.
    <br>You people have a very strong crisis.
    <br>The affection is nothing to write home about.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You have to let your husband know your challenge.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>You have a very strong challenge.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Your husband loves you but you don't know how to go about it.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Your affection for your husband is dead.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>She has an attack and she doesn't know how to go about it.
    <br>It was in the dream a woman attacked you; woman to woman.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>The woman started sleeping with you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Since that time, your life changed.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>It is no longer your husband but the woman, sleeping with you in the dream.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>As a result, you don't have affection for your husband.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Can you see now? It is not a deliberate act.
    <br>It is an attack and it can happen to anyone if God is not involved.
    <br>It is the spirit of woman.
    <br>She has the spirit of woman.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Desiree Nhlapo and the person standing next to me is my husband Nicholas Nhlapo
    <br>and we are from South Africa.
    <br>Last week, when we were in church, the man of God prophesied and said I have got the spirit of a woman
    <br>and my affection for my husband is dead.
    <br>The prophecy is true.
    <br>It all started when I was still in high school, having a relationship with a woman to woman.
    <br>It went on until I got married and it was still there even in my marriage.
    <br>It affected my marriage so bad to the extent that I did not have affection for my husband.
    <br>Even when he wanted to touch me, I did not feel him.
    <br>I did not want anything to do with my husband.
    <br>It went on to the extent that our marriage nearly ended until my mum advised that we come to The SCOAN.
    <br>We were here last week, and that touch, the touch from above made a miracle.
    <br>The touch from God - that He used the man of God -
    <br>it made a miracle, it was a total switch.
    <br>It was a total switch and I thank God for that
    <br>because that spirit is gone, it's no more.
    <br>It is no more and I thank God for that
    <br>because now I have affection for my husband, I can look him into his eyes
    <br>and we can relate well as husband and wife.
    <br>I thank God Almighty for using the man of God to restore our marriage.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>You have said it all and before we listen to your husband,
    <br>could you just tell us what word of advice you have for all who are listening to you.
    <br>Firstly, I just want to also thank my husband, the king of my heart, for having patience
    <br>and fighting in prayer during this trial.
    <br>I want to say to the world, to all married couples that never give up on your marriage.
    <br>A marriage is the highest institution of God.
    <br>It's created by God for a purpose so never, never give up on your marriage.
    <br>There is nothing too difficult for God, if you believe and trust in Him, He will restore your marriage.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We thank you so much for that wonderful piece of advice,
    <br>and let's quickly take a few seconds to listen to your husband.
    <br>Mrs Desiree Nhlapo & Husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>You are welcome in Jesus' name. Introduce yourself to us and what you have to say about your wife's testimony.
    <br>Good Morning everybody.
    <br>My name is Nicholas Nhlapo. Standing beside me is my wife Desiree Nhlapo.
    <br>We are both from South Africa.
    <br>Days before coming to this place,
    <br>my marriage with my wife was actually hellish.
    <br>Things were forever sour.
    <br>I cannot explain as to what it was in my heart that kept having hope.
    <br>But I must tell the truth - it was as good as hell.
    <br>Days before - I'm not sure when Emmanuel TV was introduced to me -
    <br>to say, I think you guys need to go to The SCOAN.
    <br>My mother-in-law was the one who actually suggested that.
    <br>I couldn't understand with my own understanding
    <br>because I was praying and praying and nothing was happening.
    <br>My marriage was so bad. We couldn't even talk to one another.
    <br>My wife would definitely communicate with me via SMS.
    <br>She would leave me in the house early in the morning, both of us would be awake
    <br>and she would tell me what needed to be done as a responsible father,
    <br>things that I would have to take.
    <br>I couldn't even touch her, she couldn't even look at me.
    <br>I would desire a lot as a man, as many husbands in here.
    <br>But nothing was on the table for me to enjoy.
    <br>It became so bad that it even extended to our kids.
    <br>We are blessed with five kids. It has been a horror to us, it has been a horror to them.
    <br>As much as I was saying and indicating that the marriage was actually hell, it was indeed hell.
    <br>Ok. Finally, when you came to The SCOAN, what happened?
    <br>Coming to The SCOAN, it came as a shock when the prophecy came through the man of God.
    <br>He was spot on when he told me that there was a crisis in my marriage.
    <br>You might have noticed that in the video clip, I was actually speechless
    <br>because I hadn't chatted with him and then coming on spot like that, I felt naked at the same time.
    <br>Being a man of my own stature, I keep things to myself.
    <br>To hear it from a man of God speaking like that was completely uncomfortable.
    <br>It was actually true as I have already indicated.
    <br>I had to acknowledge that it was true; indeed, we had a crisis in our marriage.
    <br>So after the prophecy and deliverance followed suit,
    <br>could you just tell us - what are the changes you have noticed in your marriage?
    <br>After the prophecy, we were delivered - both my wife and I.
    <br>My experience became an extension of peace in myself, a better understanding,
    <br>and when I looked at my wife, I saw some changes.
    <br>She could look at me right in the face.
    <br>I normally love the way she looks at me but this time it was more than just that.
    <br>If I may brag, allow me to brag - it's what I feel inside, I believe you all know and understand.
    <br>If you can look at her right now, when she smiles, I actually melt.
    <br>I am lost for words as I speak now because I feel it.
    <br>Mrs Desiree Nhlapo & Husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>By the way, that's when I saw it for the first time; when I saw her for the first time, she was smiling.
    <br>And it goes on and on right now.
    <br>So she has been humble.
    <br>She has been talking to me. I haven't received a SMS conversation ever since we came here.
    <br>She is telling me things I desired back then.
    <br>I'm hearing things I want to hear.
    <br>Actually, this morning she called me 'Oga', I was like what?
    <br>I even asked her, "Do you understand the meaning of 'Oga'? What does that mean?"
    <br>She smiled at me again, and I was like, "It means, indeed, I'm a king".
    <br>Shall we clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>Mrs Desiree Nhlapo & Husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Indeed, the affection is back and I want to thank the man of God for delivering us.
    <br>I am proud to say, "Thank you, thank you so much".
    <br>I can't say it in words what I have in my heart and my head.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>Thank you very much and finally, what word of advice do you have for those who are listening to you?
    <br>To all those who are listening, to men especially:
    <br>I believe having Jesus in your heart, regardless of how much you know Him
    <br>will give you the insight into where I am right now,
    <br>to recover and regain my kingship in the eyes of my wife.
    <br>Mrs Desiree Nhlapo & Husband
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Invite Him. It doesn't matter how much you know about Him.
    <br>Keep Him in your heart regardless of the situation; hand over everything to Him.
    <br>That's what I can say to men.
    <br>Amen, let's clap for wonderful Jesus Christ.
    <br>We rejoice with you greatly for this wonderful restoration through the message of prophecy
    <br>you received last week Sunday here.
    <br>We also want to encourage you to go and make the Word of God the standard for your lives
    <br>and always have it at the back of your minds, that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
