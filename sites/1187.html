  <p>    
    <br>You have the spirit of anger.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This spirit of anger keeps destroying your home.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Take it easy; there is a fast they asked you to do.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You did not do it at all.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>They asked you to fast for two days.
    <br>The prophecy you gave is that I have a spirit of anger.
    <br>Because of that, I lock my husband when we are fighting and tear his clothes.
    <br>Please, Man of God, deliver me.
    <br>I lock my husband and tear his clothes when the spirit comes.
    <br>What did I tell you? I said the anger has destroyed your home.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Anybody who sees you sees a beautiful woman but you're going through a thorough punishment.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Anger.
    <br>Yes, sir; I do cry.
    <br>Where is your husband?
    <br>My husband is in the church.
    <br>- Can you go and call your husband.
    <br>- Mr Godwin, come out.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Man of God, what you said about my wife is true.
    <br>Any time she is fighting with me, she will hold my clothes and hold my penis.
    <br>Then I will beg her.
    <br>Man of God, please deliver us.
    <br>Man of God, help me. She always fights me.
    <br>Any time we fight, I will beg her.
    <br>She will hold my clothes and tear my clothes; she will not allow me to go out.
    <br>And hold your what?
    <br>My penis.
    <br>Man of God, sometimes he will go out to drink.
    <br>When he comes back, I will be angry that he went out.
    <br>You can't find any other place to hold.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>I want to see you people. It's alright; it's over.
    <br>The danger there is that you locked your husband inside and you locked it with the key.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>For what?
    <br>If that anger came, sir - but I know I am free today; it won't happen again.
    <br>That is not what I am asking you.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Mrs Godwin Iyan Okoh.
    <br>I'm from Ebonyi state; I reside in Osun state.
    <br>The person beside me is my husband.
    <br>The other ones are my children.
    <br>The prophecy the man of God gave to me last Sunday was 100% true.
    <br>I had a spirit of anger, just like the man of God said.
    <br>That spirit of anger has destroyed my home.
    <br>When the spirit came, I would fight my husband.
    <br>When we started fighting, I would want my husband to wound me
    <br>before I would leave him to go.
    <br>When the spirit came over me, I would like to fight my husband,
    <br>tear his clothes, his trousers.
    <br>I would then hold his manhood so that he would kill me before escaping.
    <br>That must have been a very serious spirit of anger.
    <br>As the woman said, it nearly destroyed the home.
    <br>Can you share with us more of the kind of fighting that occurred between you and your husband.
    <br>This fighting started since we got married.
    <br>Sometimes, we would fight every week, every month.
    <br>When I was still having a child with him, I would fight with him.
    <br>When my kids were still small, we would fight.
    <br>It is just my two sons that would witness and still recollect how we would fight.
    <br>If we wanted to fight, I would look my husband into the room.
    <br>I would tell my husband, "If you don't kill me, you are not going anywhere".
    <br>My husband would start beating me, hitting me so that he would then escape.
    <br>Immediately the spirit left me, I would say, "I will not do that again".
    <br>But when the spirit came, I would fight.
    <br>It would normally start when he went out to drink.
    <br>When he came back, I would start being angry with him.
    <br>Ok. You said something that you even used to lock your husband and yourself in the room.
    <br>What did you do with the key when you locked the door?
    <br>When I locked the door, I would throw the key (away).
    <br>Both of us wouldn't find where the key was.
    <br>But when he beat me, sometimes, he would just see the key in time.
    <br>He might open the door or sometimes, he would use his leg to break the door and run out.
    <br>So that was how the spirit of anger had caused this problem and disunity in the home.
    <br>Yes. Even when the spirit came and my children were still small, I would beat, hit them.
    <br>My second son was even telling me at a certain time, "Mummy, you have changed.
    <br>You don't beat us again. You don't play karate again".
    <br>During the times you were having this disunity as a result of this spirit of anger
    <br>that caused a constant fight between you and your husband,
    <br>were there some efforts put in place to bring about settlement between you and your husband
    <br>before you finally received your deliverance last week Sunday?
    <br>Yes. My husband's mother and family would call us that we should stop fighting;
    <br>that this thing we were doing was not good;
    <br>that if we continued fighting like this and separated, what would happen to the kids.
    <br>My mother-in-law would plead with me that I should calm down.
    <br>When my mother-in-law finished talking to me, I would accept.
    <br>But when the spirit came again, I would start and not even remember what she said to me again.
    <br>That means it was a spirit you could not control as she said that our fight is not carnal
    <br>and it was only God that could deliver this family.
    <br>That was what happened last week Sunday and it all came through the power of prophecy.
    <br>My name is Godwin Iyan Okoh. I'm from Obonyi state.
    <br>This is my lovely wife and these are my children.
    <br>According to the prophecy of last week - the prophecy is 100% true
    <br>because my wife had the spirit of anger.
    <br>I myself had the spirit of drinking.
    <br>Sometimes, I would go out to drink.
    <br>When I came back, my wife wouldn't be happy.
    <br>As a man, I would try to tell her that I was the owner of the house;
    <br>that she couldn't control me.
    <br>From there, we would be fighting.
    <br>Sometimes, she would tear my clothes and hold my penis.
    <br>She would not allow me to go out.
    <br>To the extent, that one day, she locked the door.
    <br>I didn't know where she dropped the key.
    <br>She said I must kill her.
    <br>I then used my leg to break the door.
    <br>Sometimes, after begging her, she would open the door.
    <br>So this was how the spirit disturbed our marriage.
    <br>So let's ask your wife.
    <br>How did you normally feel during this time you engaged your husband in those fights?
    <br>When the spirit came, I couldn't control myself.
    <br>Nobody could tell me something I would accept.
    <br>I liked it when the two of us were fighting.
    <br>After the fighting, I would say, "Ah, why did I do this?"
    <br>I would tell myself, "I will not do this again".
    <br>The spirit would still torment me to fight.
    <br>But ever since the man of God gave these words of prophecy to you last week Sunday
    <br>and went on to deliver you and your husband,
    <br>can you tell us the changes you have seen in your life and your marriage?
    <br>The spirit has left me; we are living fine.
    <br>It is like the first day we met.
    <br>Ladies that are here, the first day you met your husband, you know how it is.
    <br>Hallelujah. Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>I said, put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>We should give glory to God for this power of prophecy through His anointed one, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>If not for the power of prophecy that revealed the problem in this marriage,
    <br>we know, as the woman said, it would have destroyed the home
    <br>and we know what the consequences would have been.
    <br>And look at the beautiful family we are seeing today.
    <br>They would not have been here today to share this wonderful testimony
    <br>with the children of God, if not for the power of prophecy.
    <br>Once again, shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Since last week, it is as if we just wedded.
    <br>Since then, she has changed.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Hallelujah. Once again, put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>You also talked about the spirit of drinking.
    <br>Ever since you received your deliverance, what can you say concerning that?
    <br>My sister, in fact, before, every day I had to drink something - like 3-4 bottles in a day.
    <br>But since last Sunday - even the church I was going to before at my place,
    <br>I would be in the church and pretend as if I was going to urinate.
    <br>I would take (a drink) but now, that spirit has left me - the spirit of drinking.
    <br>What kind of drink did you use to take then?
    <br>My sister, we have many people here that were drinking before.
    <br>We have different types of drinks in the town - alcohol.
    <br>So we have just heard from our brother that he was into this drinking of alcohol
    <br>and he took many bottles in a day.
    <br>But not only was peace restored into the marriage,
    <br>he was also delivered from that spirit of drinking - drunkenness.
    <br>And since that deliverance last week Sunday, it is a week now.
    <br>Have you ever tasted alcohol?
    <br>No, I have not.
    <br>So ever since your deliverance, do you still have that urge to drink?
    <br>Not at all.
    <br>Hallelujah. We give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful deliverance
    <br>that has taken place in this family.
    <br>My name is Uchechukwu Iyan.
    <br>I'm the first son of Mr Godwin - my parents.
    <br>Back then, it used to be terrible.
    <br>Every time they started fighting, all our neighbours used to come around.
    <br>It was always very terrible.
    <br>Our landlord would have to call to speak to them.
    <br>Some nights, my dad wouldn't sleep at home.
    <br>He would go out to drink and after the fight like that, he would just leave.
    <br>But now, everything has changed; there is peace in the family right now.
    <br>We are hearing from the children themselves. Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>My name is Iyan Uchechukwu.
    <br>These are my brothers and those are my parents.
    <br>I can confirm the prophecy that the man of God gave to my mother about anger.
    <br>When I was very young, I remember vividly that one day, my dad just came back home,
    <br>took the television set and smashed it on the floor - just like that.
    <br>I think it was because they quarrelled in the morning.
    <br>So all these things were going on and it was embarrassing for us.
    <br>Like going to school, our parents were always fighting and all these kinds of things.
    <br>I thank God that after last week, everything has been okay
    <br>and there has been peace in the family.
    <br>I give glory to God. Emmanuel!
    <br>Mr & Mrs Godwin Iyan Okoh & Family
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>The word of advice I have for the whole world:
    <br>Please, those who have this kind of problem - trust in God.
    <br>God will see you through one day.
    <br>Continue praying; don't leave God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The word of advice I have for the world is:
    <br>If you are having any problem, just have faith in God.
    <br>One day, God will see you through as He has seen my family through, in Jesus' name.
    <br>So you have heard a word of advice from the couple,
    <br>advising all to have faith in God.
    <br>Whatever problem you may be having, God is more than able to see you through.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for this wonderful thing He has done in your family -
    <br>for this restoration of peace, harmony and unity in the family.
    <br>We just want to advise you that you should make sure
    <br>you continue to stay true to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
    <br>and make His Word the standard for your life
    <br>and we know that better is not good enough, the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
