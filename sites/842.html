    <br>Testimony From The South Korea Crusade
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I glorify the name of Jesus.
    <br>She is my wife
    <br>Lee Jae Kweon
    <br>Chung Nam, South Korea
    <br>My name is Lee Jae Kweon. I am from Chung Nam, South Korea. The woman beside me is my wife.
    <br>I had a slipped disc. I came to the crusade with crutches
    <br>and my wife came in a wheelchair.
    <br>After receiving prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua, we are completely healed.
    <br>Now, I am able to walk without crutches
    <br>and my wife can walk without the need of a wheelchair.
    <br>I came to the crusade with crutches because of spinal stenosis
    <br>and my wife came to the crusade in a wheelchair.
    <br>After receiving prayer from Prophet T.B. Joshua, we are both totally healed and now we are free.

    <br>The man standing next to me is my husband.
    <br>My name is Kim Yeon Ok and the man standing next to me is my husband.
    <br>I came to the crusade in a wheelchair and my husband came with crutches.
    <br>Now, we are completely healed and healthy. So we are very thankful to God.
    <br>We are very happy because we received freedom. We give glory and thanksgiving to God.
    <br>I came to the crusade in a wheelchair and my husband came with crutches.
    <br>But now, both of us are completely healed. I am very thankful to God. I am very free now.
    <br>I really thank God for this healing and miracles.
    <br>Thank You, God! You gave us freedom and healing.
    <br>Our Lord, Jesus, we love You!
