  <p>    
    <br>How many of us wine and dine with Jesus?
    <br>We worship Him in the natural, not in the Spirit.
    <br>That is why you need to depend on what people say about God,
    <br>on what you read about God only,
    <br>on what the situation around looks like
    <br>because you worship Him in the natural.
    <br>Hardly anyone here can explain what is happening,
    <br>"What am I looking at? I don't understand it. I am only seeing a woman coming out to talk."
    <br>Take note of the word, "Separation".
    <br>This is why you are here today.
    <br>Demon CHALLENGES T.B. Joshua To A FIGHT!!!
    <br>That is why everyone is here today;
    <br>to separate you from poverty, darkness, affliction, sickness, setback, barrenness, failure.
    <br>Many are here at the point of breakthrough.
    <br>You see them; they will say, "Ah, he has made it".
    <br>Just at the point of breakthrough, the thing will just drop.
    <br>People will say, "Ah. Too frustrating."
    <br>If the whole thing dropped at the beginning,
    <br>one can reason that you are not making it.
    <br>But after you have beaten many people,
    <br>at the point of breakthrough, when many hopes are on you,
    <br>many have invested in you, many have supported you, many are looking at you as their hope...
    <br>Separation.
    <br>Look at the word "separation".
    <br>I answer.
    <br>If the Lord used me to separate you now...
    <br>Come here!
    <br>After the congregation watched the clips of the woman
    <br>who was delivered from the evil spirit that possessed her,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministered to the congregation
    <br>that today they will be separated from their limitations.
    <br>A woman possessing a contrary spirit amidst the congregation screams out,
    <br>and Prophet T.B. Joshua calls her to come out.
    <br>The evil spirit that had been tormenting the life of this woman speaks out of her
    <br>with frustration and anger, as she walks towards the altar.
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Where are you?
    <br>You are strong.
    <br>You want to separate me!
    <br>You are strong.
    <br>I said, come here.
    <br>You want to separate me!
    <br>Why are you disturbing me?
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Listen to what I'm talking about.
    <br>What have we done now that brought about this?
    <br>Give it to her.
    <br>You will show me your power today.
    <br>Wait. Allow her. Let her abuse me.
    <br>Say whatever you want to say.
    <br>You will show me your power today.
    <br>Which power do you have to show me?
    <br>Let her talk everything.
    <br>You want to take my wife from me.
    <br>You cannot take it away from me.
    <br>Let her abuse me.
    <br>You cannot take it away from me.
    <br>Listen to her.
    <br>Yes. You can't.
    <br>Listen to her.
    <br>He is disturbing me. 
    <br>What is this?
    <br>Even in the dream, you are disturbing me.
    <br>What is all this?
    <br>Listen.
    <br>You want to take my wife from me.
    <br>You cannot take her.
    <br>She is my wife.
    <br>I love her so much.
    <br>You can't take her.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I'm asking you.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>She says, "Who are you?"
    <br>She started the question, "Look at you. You small boy. Who are you?"
    <br>I stopped her from having a baby for her husband.
    <br>She will never have a baby.
    <br>See, this is not pregnancy.
    <br>Do you know the reason I allow you to see the drama very well?
    <br>If I don't want her to talk, she will not talk.
    <br>If all this nonsense is said, I want you to know that this is light and darkness.
    <br>If you don't see clearly like that, it will be difficult for you to understand what has happened.
    <br>You will show me your power today.
    <br>You will show me where that power comes from today.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>OK, let's now move. Leave her, don't touch her.
    <br>Why are you disturbing me in the dream?
    <br>- Leave me alone.
    <br>- Be on your knees.
    <br>Leave me alone, please.
    <br>Be on your knees.
    <br>Demon CHALLENGES T.B. Joshua To A FIGHT!!!
    <br>Somebody who wants to beat me.
    <br>I say somebody who planned to beat me at the beginning.
    <br>Can you imagine now?
    <br>Stand up there.
    <br>I say, stand up!
    <br>Just leave her.
    <br>We still have a long way to go.
    <br>Somebody who was kneeling down is abusing me again.
    <br>Look at her again.
    <br>She says you will see today.
    <br>See.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>That is their life in the spirit.
    <br>They are fake.
    <br>- They are what?
    <br>- [Fake.]
    <br>They will threaten you. If you don't have Jesus, you will begin to run.
    <br>- Come here!
    <br>- You will do what?
    <br>Come here!
    <br>I will beat you now.
    <br>Demon CHALLENGES T.B. Joshua To A FIGHT!!!
    <br>- You will beat me?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>OK, start.
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Be on your knees!
    <br>The question now: What is talking in them?
    <br>She says, "Come here. I will beat you."
    <br>She really means to beat.
    <br>If you are not in Christ Jesus, she will beat.
    <br>That is just the secret there.
    <br>Don't think that they are just making...
    <br>You say what?
    <br>Why are you disturbing me?
    <br>Leave me alone.
    <br>What is all this?
    <br>You have destroyed everything.
    <br>Why?
    <br>I will deal with you.
    <br>- You say what?
    <br>- I will deal with you.
    <br>- You will beat me?
    <br>- I will deal with you.
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>You want to beat?
    <br>So that is their life for you.
    <br>Yes. OK, go down there.
    <br>I say, go there.
    <br>T.B. Joshua!
    <br>You are T.B. Joshua!
    <br>- Where is T.B. Joshua?
    <br>- You are T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Don't touch me!
    <br>Demon CHALLENGES T.B. Joshua To A FIGHT!!!
    <br>OK. Please!
    <br>Remember, it is one of the ministries.
    <br>We have five ministries - this is just one.
    <br>Don't let us waste our time on this.
    <br>We have five ministries; prophetic ministry is still inside.
    <br>Healing ministry is inside.
    <br>So, this is just deliverance ministry.
    <br>So, if we now put all our efforts, everything here,
    <br>it is like we are robbing ourselves from the blessing of God.
    <br>So please, shift your attention now.
    <br>Yes, back to the other lady.
    <br>Deliver me.
    <br>Earlier you said you wanted to beat me.
    <br>I'm sorry. Deliver me, Man of God.
    <br>She says she is sorry.
    <br>We are here for separation.
    <br>Whatever that is not planted by God in you...
    <br>[Out!]
    <br>It is too early. I'm only telling you what we are going for.
    <br>We are here for separation.
    <br>If there is anything that is planted by satan in whichever way,
    <br>in your business, life, marital life, nightmare, hardship...
    <br>I mean - you know your situation.
    <br>I say you know your situation.
    <br>Can you see what I'm talking about now - the ministry we are under?
    <br>We have five-fold ministry here, and only one now is trying to rob us, taking so much time,
    <br>whereas we still have four more.
    <br>It is just one.
    <br>Everyone must pass through the deliverance.
    <br>Like this sister here - her own is too much.
    <br>When you have too much of darkness, the thing will be worrying you.
    <br>We have not talked of deliverance and she started shouting.
    <br>But you - it is just little little.
    <br>They are the ones that afflicted you.
    <br>There are some that are afflicted here, there are some that are 'authors'.
    <br>There are three different demons.
    <br>We have some that are afflicted by this evil power,
    <br>some are those who afflicted them, and those whom they afflicted.
    <br>They are here.
    <br>So, when it is time for deliverance, the reaction of that different, those who afflicted people,
    <br>you will see them crying, jumping.
    <br>But those who are afflicted; you may not fall, but through your sweat, the thing will come out.
    <br>It may be through mere cough - you just find yourself being delivered.
    <br>You may feel being pressed, you want to go to restroom,
    <br>during the prayer you find yourself going to the restroom - that is the end of the problem.
    <br>So, in a different way, you that has been afflicted, this thing can go.
    <br>It is not necessarily that you will fall.
    <br>You may fall.
    <br>Those who afflicted you - you will see their reaction.
    <br>Deliver me, Man of God!
    <br>Earlier you said you wanted to beat me.
    <br>I will not do it.
    <br>I don't know why I'm doing it.
    <br>You said you wanted to beat me.
    <br>No, I will not beat you.
    <br>Your power is bigger than my own.
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>So now, can you see?
    <br>You have started beating her.
    <br>The one that was talking before was the one inside her.
    <br>You know, everyone here has two natures in one person.
    <br>As you are sitting now, you are with two personalities.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I'm with two personalities."
    <br>As you are sitting now, you are with two personalities.
    <br>One is celestial and another is Mr You that I can see.
    <br>One we can see, another one we can see by eyes of faith.
    <br>Two personalities in one person.
    <br>If you live for God, you have the divine nature of God.
    <br>The one we can see by the eyes of faith, that is divine nature of God.
    <br>But if you now give your life to satan, you now have the divine nature of satan.
    <br>That is those who inspire people to steal, to kill, to destroy.
    <br>So the one she is having now, that is the divine nature of satan, that is living inside her.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Juliet Njideka Ohia.
    <br>I came from Imo State.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was the problem of spiritual husband.
    <br>This spiritual husband had been tormenting my life for years.
    <br>I don't have a child.
    <br>Whenever I was pregnant, the spiritual husband would come and sleep with me
    <br>and the pregnancy would be destroyed.
    <br>Failure, disappointments, hatred were everywhere.
    <br>This spiritual husband had been tormenting me.
    <br>It affected my husband because he is an electrical engineer and
    <br>if he told me that they called him to come and wire a house,
    <br>I would say, "OK, you can go."
    <br>But I knew that they would not give him the job.
    <br>Sometimes, the disappointments were like that.
    <br>The boys that my husband trained were given more jobs than him.
    <br>This is how the spiritual husband had been tormenting my life.
    <br>In my dreams, a man used to come to sleep with me.
    <br>I also ate and swam in the river in my dreams.
    <br>After sleeping with him in my dream, I wouldn't have affection for my husband.
    <br>I would just hate him.
    <br>We have gone to many churches, prayer houses, spiritual churches for solution,
    <br>but to no avail.
    <br>Last week Sunday, while I was sitting there quietly and watching a video of a woman
    <br>who was possessed by an evil spirit,
    <br>immediately I turned my face to look at the man of God, I saw fire.
    <br>The colour of the fire was yellow and the fire came to me.
    <br>The fire was burning me from my head down to the rest of my body.
    <br>I didn't want to come out because everywhere was quiet.
    <br>I then jumped out and started shouting at the man of God.
    <br>I didn't even know what I was saying; it was the evil spirit inside me that was talking.
    <br>I didn't even know I was shouting at the man of God, or that I wanted to beat him.
    <br>The man of God should have mercy on me and forgive me because I didn't know what I was doing.
    <br>Since my deliverance, I have been okay. I feel alright.
    <br>When the man of God prayed for me, I felt the evil spirit come out of my body.
    <br>Since then, I have been okay.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, my body was very heavy, I couldn't run.
    <br>Since I received prayer, I have been okay. I'm alright.
    <br>I no longer eat, sleep with a man or swim in the river in my dreams.
    <br>And since the man of God invited your husband, tell us the feelings you have towards your husband.
    <br>Do you still feel that disgust you used to feel each time you had an encounter with the spiritual husband?
    <br>How do you see your husband now?
    <br>I love him so much.
    <br>When the spiritual husband was inside me, I didn't love him.
    <br>Now, I love him so much.
    <br>So, I want to tell him that I'm sorry for what happened in the past and
    <br>that I am delivered now.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for this wonderful deliverance,
    <br>and we know that this deliverance is not only your deliverance,
    <br>but the deliverance for the whole family.
    <br>We would like to hear from the husband, to hear his experience,
    <br>and also to tell us how he feels now, that the wife is finally delivered
    <br>from this evil, spiritual husband that has been tormenting her and the family.
    <br>Sir, please tell us your name and where you come from.
    <br>My name is Engineer Okechukwu.
    <br>I came from Imo State to The SCOAN.
    <br>This is my wife beside me.
    <br>I'm thankful to God for delivering my wife from the spiritual husband
    <br>that had tormented her life for a long time.
    <br>I believe that God solved the problem for our family and that she is free.
    <br>I am also free.
    <br>I love her.
    <br>This thing had made me to drive her out of our home before.
    <br>I had to call her back so that she would be delivered
    <br>and live with me because of the love I have for her.
    <br>After that, I called her back and
    <br>took her to many places for deliverance but there was no solution.
    <br>We were going from one church to another.
    <br>She said that she wanted to come to The SCOAN
    <br>where she would receive her freedom.
    <br>She is now delivered.
    <br>Can you tell us some of those things that happened to you in the past.
    <br>The past is over, but for the glory of God:
    <br>How much torment did you receive, as a result of this spiritual husband in the life of your wife?
    <br>What were the things that happened to you,
    <br>that now you give glory to God that it is a thing of the past?
    <br>During that time, I experienced many things including accidents and hardship.
    <br>I had nobody coming to me as a friend or stayed along.
    <br>My friends and my colleagues rejected me; they didn't like me.
    <br>Sometimes if I slept, I wouldn't even remember that my wife was with me.
    <br>Sometimes she didn't want me near her; she wanted me to be on my own.
    <br>Sometimes she felt cheated and I would ask, "What is the problem?
    <br>What makes you feel cheated?"
    <br>She would think that I was going out with other women.
    <br>I didn't know that it was the spiritual husband
    <br>that was making her to do those things.
    <br>I was thinking that she was doing it out of her own mind.
    <br>I didn't know that it was the spiritual husband that was making her to do those things.
    <br>For me to know that it was a spiritual husband, it took years.
    <br>I'm happy that she is now delivered.
    <br>We thank God for your life.
    <br>Now, that the old man is gone, the evil spirit has left your life, all things become new.
    <br>And not only your life but in this family, marriage, all thing become new.
    <br>And this deliverance is going to produce fruit, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>And now it is over, we want to encourage you to embrace the wonderful Word of God,
    <br>as the most effective instrument for change.
    <br>Because the Bible says, when we receive deliverance and healing from Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>we should follow Jesus along the way, to make His Word the standard for our lives.
    <br>And now we pray that God Almighty will give you the inner grace
    <br>to make His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>and as you do so, it shall be well with you, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
