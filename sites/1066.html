    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Hannah Mgemezulu. I'm 22 years old and I'm from Malawi.
    <br>This is my mother and the other one is my sister.
    <br>Last week, the man of God gave me a prophecy and that prophecy is true.
    <br>When I was 13 years old, I used to feel that this part of my body was heavy
    <br>and I had a strange urge which began at that age.
    <br>Because my father was a pastor, I used to tell him to pray for me
    <br>as I had no feeling on one side of my body.
    <br>He would pray for me and tell me that I was delivered.
    <br>The next day, I would ask him, "Dad, pray for me;
    <br>the same feeling I was having yesterday is still there".
    <br>He would pray for me and say, "You are delivered!"
    <br>Then, I just gave up as I could not be telling him every day to pray for me.
    <br>After that, I went to a boarding school where I was exposed to the world.
    <br>My friends introduced me to drinking, which I started to do.
    <br>From the first day I started drinking, I liked alcohol very much and I never stopped drinking.
    <br>And what age were you when you started drinking alcohol?
    <br>I started drinking at the age of 15.
    <br>Then I continued drinking, going out with my friends until in that secondary school, I was expelled.
    <br>They removed me from the school.
    <br>We would drink, hold parties and started destroying the school.
    <br>After that, my mum took me to a school because my father was angry at me
    <br>and refused to pay my school fees.
    <br>My mum then took me to this day secondary school where she was paying my school fees.
    <br>For the whole term, I can say I attended school for one week.
    <br>I would go to school but then go off with my friends, straight to the town
    <br>to buy alcohol and drink. Then, I would go back to school and start making noise
    <br>and would be expelled again.
    <br>I wrote exams; then I went to university where I was exposed to a newer kind of freedom.
    <br>As I was far away from home, I had freedom - my mum and dad were not there.
    <br>I started drinking excessively; every day I would get drunk.
    <br>After class or maybe on the way to class, I would be drinking.
    <br>After three weeks, I met this boy who was smoking Indian Hemp.
    <br>I asked him what he was smoking. He told me that it was weed, that it could make me high.
    <br>I told him that I wanted to get high and then he introduced me to weed.
    <br>I loved the weed so much - more than alcohol.
    <br>I would smoke it and in class, they would call me 'Banana' - that was my name now.
    <br>Beautiful and high nana because I was always high.
    <br>If you saw my eyes then, you could not see the white area as it looked not even red but black.
    <br>Brown - I don't know what I can call it.
    <br>I would drink in the morning and evening; everywhere I went, I would drink.
    <br>My father died and I was alone. I used to cry about his death but then I would forget about it.
    <br>My mum believed that her giving me money, led to my drinking
    <br>and so she reduced the amount of money she would send me.
    <br>She would just send me enough money for food or pocket money;
    <br>I could count it, and it wasn't enough to support my drinking habit.
    <br>I told my mum when I was on holiday,
    <br>"Mum, are you serious? You have stopped giving me money! Your daughter!"
    <br>She said, "Yes, I have stopped". I told her, "I will find money in my own way!"
    <br>I then challenged my mum, "I will follow men!"
    <br>I then started following men.
    <br>I would tell the men I followed that I loved them, whereas I loved their money
    <br>because I wanted them to buy me alcohol; I wanted to drink every day.
    <br>I would just come out from my house, start walking, without knowing where I was going
    <br>I would just find myself in the bar.
    <br>I would drink and people would just buy me alcoholic drinks.
    <br>This led to me following men.
    <br>My boyfriend left me and he told me, "Ah, you are a prostitute!
    <br>"How can I be with a girl who follows men just because of alcohol!" Then he dumped me.
    <br>Because people knew that I loved alcohol, two girls in the fourth year invited me to their room
    <br>to drink. They bought me wine and a bottle of vodka.
    <br>We started drinking. After I got drunk, they both slept with me.
    <br>After that, the spirit of man entered me and whenever a woman would pass me,
    <br>I would want to look at her behind.
    <br>Because I was shy and could not approach the women, it led me to masturbation;
    <br>I would just look at the women and then masturbate. It also led me to pornography.
    <br>Also, when I was in the third year, at a party drinking,
    <br>two boys raped me which led me to start hating men.
    <br>I did not like men anymore.
    <br>That led to frequent masturbation. I would masturbate five times a day, just to satisfy myself.
    <br>But I was still not satisfied. The drinking, smoking and masturbation did not satisfy me.
    <br>When I was dissatisfied, I would drink more than any man -
    <br>they could not challenge me when it came to drinking alochol.
    <br>I would drink and smoke maybe 15 blunts a day.
    <br>Because of my drinking and smoking, I wasn't going to school.
    <br>I was suspended for the first time and then went back to school.
    <br>I continued with the same behaviour - challenging my teachers, saying funny things in class,
    <br>before being suspended for the second time.
    <br>One day, I was sitting and looking at my mum as she was crying and complaining about me.
    <br>My neighbours would be saying all sorts of bad things about me. I told her she had her God.
    <br>She had taken me to a lot of different places but no solution. I would even challenge pastors,
    <br>telling them that they could not deliver me.
    <br>I would tell them, "You deliver me today, I'll drink again tomorrow; I'm even high now".
    <br>Just after they would pray for me, I would go out, smoke and come back to tell them,
    <br>"I have smoked the weed. Have you prayed for me?"
    <br>My mum would complain. Emmanuel TV would always be on in our house and we would watch it.
    <br>I believed that the man of God, T.B. Joshua, was the only one who had the power
    <br>to deliver me from the evil spirit within me.
    <br>So, I told my mum not to waste her money on school fees
    <br>as I knew that if she sent me to school, I would be suspended again.
    <br>I told her to take me to the man of God, and then that's when she brought me here.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So you mean, even to the point where you came here, you were still smoking,
    <br>still drinking, still engaging in all of these things just before you arrived here in the church.
    <br>Yes, the week before I came here, I was drinking more than I used to.
    <br>I told my mum, "Let me drink for the last time because I know that this man of God,
    <br>T.B. Joshua, will deliver me". I had never fallen down before.
    <br>Before, I had never fallen down upon receiving prayer, I would just laugh at them.
    <br>I said, "Mum, I know that this pastor will deliver me. This will be my last time drinking".
    <br>I was drinking until the day that I came here.
    <br>Wow,  we thank God that God brought you here to The SCOAN.
    <br>You said, in your experience, when you were being prayed for,
    <br>you never had an experience of falling down or receiving a touch from the anointing of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Can you describe to us: When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you,
    <br>what happened to you? Just describe that experience.
    <br>At first he was moving and touching everyone. When he touched me, I felt something
    <br>and became so angry; I wanted to scream but I don't know what happened.
    <br>After that, he came and and gave me a word of prophecy.
    <br>I don't know how to explain how I felt. I felt this power in me and on this part of my body,
    <br>something just left me and my heart became so free.
    <br>I had never been sober since I was 15 years old but after my deliverance, I am high on something
    <br>I had been searching for - I am fully satisfied!
    <br>That's how I feel.
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>That is an encounter with the power of God. Sister, it has been one week now.
    <br>Just testify - how is your life now after the deliverance and the prophecy?
    <br>What are the changes you've experienced in your life?
    <br>I'm so free in my heart. Previously, I had the spirit of anger.
    <br>I used to be very angry.
    <br>I would tell my mum that my head was hurting but I would be angry for nothing.
    <br>Now, I am so free. I feel light and I can talk to my mum and sister freely. My heart is free.
    <br>I don't have bad dreams.
    <br>I know there are  beautiful women here, but I don't have the desire to look at them.
    <br>I don't know what happened. It's just not in me anymore.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We saw in the prophecy that the man of God said that you would even attempt to satisfy yourself
    <br>throughmasturbation, to the point that you would even injure yourself.
    <br>But since that prophecy and deliverance, every urge for those things has disappeared, is that right?
    <br>Yes, completely. I don't have the urge to masturbate anymore.
    <br>I've been sleeping properly.
    <br>I sleep the whole night, and that urge is no longer in me - I don't masturbate anymore.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>So, sister, we believe you'll be in a position to give a word of advice,
    <br>especially to young people out there who may be living the kind of lifestyle
    <br>you were once living, involved in the spirit of lust, addiction to various things
    <br>such as alcohol and drugs. You are a living witness to the power of God
    <br>and the changes that He can bring in your life.
    <br>What is your advice to such people?
    <br>My advice to young people who are going through my situation is that,
    <br>the only 'highness' you can get on earth that will satisfy you is from God.
    <br>Weed, alcohol, cocaine or whatever, will not get you anywhere; just run to God.
    <br>It is only the Holy Spirit that can give you the 'high'.
    <br>As you can see me now, I am sober and I feel happy.
    <br>Those things will not make you happy; they will just disturb you mentally.
    <br>For you parents, never give up on your children.
    <br>If my mother had given up on me, I would have become something else
    <br>but she never gave up on me; don't disown your children.
    <br>Bring them close to God because God is the only one who can help you.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give all the glory to God Almighty. So at this point, let's just hear a brief word from her mother.
    <br>And we thank God for what He has done in the life of this family.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Maria Mgemezulu from Malawi.
    <br>This one is my daughter Hannah. This one is Vinjeru - it means wisdom.
    <br>I'm short of words. I'm the happiest woman in the world.
    <br>I've suffered because of this girl.
    <br>It was a challenge - a big challenge.
    <br>I could not sleep. I could not eat.
    <br>I was always praying to my God and listening to the teachings of the man of God.
    <br>One day, I was angry - very angry. I whipped her. I wanted to kill her.
    <br>After that, I started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Then the man of God was teaching that you cannot force your children
    <br>to go to church or to do good things but you should always pray for them.
    <br>I believed in that teaching.
    <br>I started praying day and night.
    <br>She would come and knock, "Stop, you woman; stop praying!"
    <br>What are you praying?  Can't you see? Now I'm smoking.
    <br>When you pray, this is when I smoke more. When you pray, this is when I drink more. Can you stop?"
    <br>I told her, "I'll not stop praying until you get delivered!"
    <br>And indeed today, she is delivered.
    <br>Hallelujah! What are the changes you've seen in your daughter's life since that deliverance?
    <br>Oh, she´s a good girl!
    <br>She can pray. She can read the Bible. We can chat. We can communicate in the morning.
    <br>After praying in our room, she'll come to the altar, pray and read the Bible.
    <br>She's discussing a lot about a her future. I'm very, very happy. Praise God
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Indeed, the evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Finally, Madam, what is your word of advice to parents, especially out there watching?
    <br>My advice is to all parents, especially women.
    <br>Please continue praying for your daughters. Don't give up. Don't shout at them.
    <br>Pray every day and night.
    <br>Keep on checking in their rooms.
    <br>I didn´t know that she was smoking and drinking.
    <br>But one day, I was cleaning their rooms. That is when I discovered Indian hemp
    <br>and bottles of beer - sachets of different types of beer.
    <br>If you went to her room today, you would find a lot of bottles and cigarettes of Indian hemp.
    <br>So, keep on checking their rooms, keep on praying for them day and night
    <br>and listen to the man of God's teachings.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Lastly, I would like to thank the man of God for keeping us for almost two weeks,
    <br>thank Emmanuel TV and Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Amen. Let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, indeed. So let's just finally here a quick word from the other sister
    <br>to cap off this wonderful testimony.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Vinjeru Mgemezulu.
    <br>The person standing next to me is my sister. The other person is my mum.
    <br>I knew that my sister used to drink because we used to sleep in the same room.
    <br>I was allergic to smells.
    <br>She would come and sleep on my bed. She would be smelling of alcohol
    <br>but I never told my mum until she found out by herself.
    <br>The time she went to university, she started drinking and smoking.
    <br>I knew everything but I could not tell my mum because the moment I had told her,
    <br>my mum would have asked her and she would get angry. Sometimes, she would beat me up.
    <br>Then sometimes, when I was mopping, she would pass.
    <br>Then when I asked her why she was passing, she would start shouting at me
    <br>and tell a lot of stories and lies.
    <br>Sometimes, she would get angry and leave the house.
    <br>She would leave the house in the morning and come back the next day in the morning,
    <br>Take a bath and go back.
    <br>Wow, so we can understand the severity of this addiction in the life of your sister.
    <br>But ever since her deliverance, what can you testify about the changes in her life?
    <br>Now we can talk. Before, when you told her a story, she would drink,
    <br>come back and tell everyone this whole story. The story was supposed to be a secret
    <br>but she would tell it -  the whole neighbourhood who actually know the story.
    <br>People in the surroundings would know the whole secret.
    <br>She never used to drink juice - she hated juice.
    <br>She hated eating, But now, she can eat, she can drink juice.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We give all the glory to God Almighty. We thank God for what He has done in the life of this family.
    <br>We just have one final question for our sister.
    <br>Sister, in the midst of this, could you tell us: When you were smoking and drinking,
    <br>what began happening to your health as a result of these addictions?
    <br>My health was affected..
    <br>If I didn't smoke, I wouldn´t eat. If I didn't smoke for three days,
    <br>I wouldn't eat for three days.
    <br>It caused seizures; I had epilepsy.
    <br>When I drank, I would fall. It was affecting me.
    <br>I would forget everything - I had loss of memory.
    <br>But ever since the deliverance all of those experiences, the seizures, the loss of memory -
    <br>everything has come to an end?
    <br>Yes, I can even eat more than my mother.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Mum, I'm sorry. You should forgive me. And i love you.
    <br>Like the man of God says, we should not keep offence.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Let´s put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
