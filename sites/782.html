  <p>    
    <br>Good morning, Church.
    <br>[Good morning.]
    <br>You are very good in receiving prayer but you are not good after the prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You are a good Christian in receiving but after receiving, a very bad Christian".
    <br>I'm telling you.
    <br>Can you see the way you have been dancing?
    <br>And now you sit quietly.
    <br>You are very good in waiting upon the Lord but when the Lord now comes,
    <br>you are not good when God leaves.
    <br>Once you are touched, it must be followed by absolute trust in God that He is now working out the answer -
    <br>no more anxiety or worry as if you never prayed at all.
    <br>Before you are touched, you know what you prayed for.
    <br>Once you are touched - absolute trust.
    <br>In whom?
    <br>In that process, there is no anxiety, worry or tension.
    <br>Leave it for God once you are touched.
    <br>But if, after the touching, you are still worried as if you had never prayed at all, it is a waste.
    <br>Such a touch is a waste.
    <br>Christians all over the world today only know how to ask for prayer
    <br>but after the prayer they don't know what to do next.
    <br>That is why you see them fall into anxiety and full of worry as if they never prayed at all.
    <br>You have diabetes, and the doctor had given you a tablet you must take regularly,
    <br>and you are here in The SCOAN sitting down with the tablet inside your pocket
    <br>because anything can happen.
    <br>You believe you would collapse without your tablet.
    <br>You are holding your tablet.
    <br>After the prayer, you begin to ask yourself, "Would I use my tablet again, or should I not use my tablet?"
    <br>I need to see the man of God and ask him whether I should still use my tablet or not.
    <br>Let me tell you what Jesus says.
    <br>Jesus says if you don't trust Him with your tablets, you can never trust Him without your tablets.
    <br>If you don't trust Jesus with your tablets, you cannot trust Him without your tablets.
    <br>It is a wisdom - a deep one.
    <br>Eighty percent of us sitting here have a tablet in the pocket.
    <br>Hypertension - a very common condition.
    <br>When I was touching a man there, he fell down; his hypertension tablet dropped on the floor.
    <br>You know what happened?
    <br>When he fell down, immediately I left the place, he collected back his tablet.
    <br>He quickly run.
    <br>I was looking.
    <br>The first thing he did after standing up was grabbing his tablet and putting it in his pocket.
    <br>Why?
    <br>"In case I'm not healed."
    <br>"I don't want to die."
    <br>You know it is very difficult to trust something you receive for free.
    <br>Something you receive for free is the most difficult thing to trust.
    <br>A man just looks at you and says, "I give you this Laser Jeep of 25 million".
    <br>"I don't know this man. I have never met him before and he gives me this!"
    <br>You can never believe.
    <br>You only believe someone whom you have served, in one way or another -
    <br>he's sent you for an errand, you have done something for him in the past, you have helped him in the past.
    <br>If he gives you such a Laser Jeep, you cannot doubt it.
    <br>When Jesus heals you, He heals you perpetually, freely.
    <br>It is always difficult to believe, compared to where you spent millions, a fortune.
    <br>But when Jesus just touches and heals you, it is always difficult to believe.
    <br>It takes the grace of God.
    <br>Take this proverb - it will help you.
    <br>If you cannot trust Jesus with your tablets, you cannot trust Him without your tablets.
    <br>There is a way Jesus does things.
    <br>It is not you that would ask Jesus whether you should use the tablet or not.
    <br>If you don't believe Him with your tablets, you cannot believe Him without the tablets.
    <br>If Jesus doesn't want you to use it again, you will just naturally forget it - it will be absent.
    <br>The following days you will not remember taking your tablets - you will naturally forget it.
    <br>That is how Jesus works.
    <br>Jesus has a way of working.
    <br>If you understand me - let me see your hand.
    <br>Look, something you take regularly; something will remind you -
    <br>it is either your blood pressure that rises, having headache, having a dry tongue,
    <br>or you find yourself going frequently to the toilet.
    <br>There are many signs that would remind you that you have to take your tablets.
    <br>But in this case, you just forget your tablet because your life seems to be normal.
    <br>After some days you realise that you have not been taking your tablets.
    <br>It is Jesus that is working.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He has the ability to block the sense of your memory if all the symptoms you had cease.
    <br>It is when there are symptoms - your body is warm, you have headache, your throat is dry, you cannot sleep -
    <br>that will remind you about your drugs.
    <br>Healing does not just come without a message.
    <br>Healing and deliverance come with a message.
    <br>If you have not been grounded in the Word and you receive healing, you will likely loose the healing.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you have not been grounded in the Word of healing and you receive healing,
    <br>you are likely to lose the healing.
    <br>That is, if you have not received a message concerning that healing.
    <br>Message is maintenance.
    <br>It is like giving you a car without teaching you how to maintain it.
    <br>You just received a car, a brand new car, and you are ignorant about maintenance - how to wash the car,
    <br>how to change the tyres - you don't know anything about it.
    <br>It means that this vehicle will soon knock down.
    <br>You must have thorough knowledge of how to maintain that vehicle.
    <br>You must be grounded in the Word to maintain healing, salvation and deliverance.
    <br>The top challenge we are facing is simple.
    <br>I make the Word first place.
    <br>I exalt the Word of God.
    <br>I make it first place.
    <br>I make my schedule around the Word of God.
    <br>Your practice has not been like that; that is why it is difficult for you to trust in God's Word.
    <br>I make my schedule around the Word of God.
    <br>I take it first place; I exalt the Word.
    <br>I disagree, I agree.
    <br>I agree with the Word of God and I disagree with any condition, situation or circumstances
    <br>that are contrary to the Word.
    <br>I disagree.
    <br>I agree with the Word of God; I choose to agree.
    <br>But when you are making your schedule, you donâ€™t carry God along.
    <br>You have already prepared your schedule for today.
    <br>When you leave here, you are going to a meeting, you must leave here at such time...
    <br>You don't carry God along.
    <br>We have not been grounded.
    <br>When we are grounded in the Word, we take it first place.
    <br>You exalt the Word.
    <br>How do we wait and believe that He is working out the answer?
    <br>How can we wait without worrying again over the situation?
    <br>When a man of God says, "You are healed, in Jesus' name", you say, "Amen" -
    <br>you would then worry and be anxious, as if you had never prayed at all.
    <br>This is a message you need to receive now.
    <br>If not, you will keep losing your healing by ignorance.
    <br>Why to receive it, if you keep losing it?
    <br>Because that worry alone nullifies your blessing.
    <br>You say, "Man of God, I have a headache".
    <br>I say, "Be healed, in Jesus' name."
    <br>I turn back and immediately you start wondering if you are healed now.
    <br>That statement alone nullifies that healing.
    <br>When you begin to compare places, where you spent millions to receive healing and you did not receive it,
    <br>with a place where somebody would just touch you and say, "You are healed".
    <br>"No, I don't know - this kind of healing - I don't know."
    <br>That nullifies immediately what you received.
    <br>If it is God, it is freedom and it is free.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"If it is God, it is freedom and it is free".
    <br>But if it is man, you have to labour for it and pay with your sweat.
    <br>So, this is what we don't know; the things of God are a mystery.
    <br>That what you receive is free does not call for questioning or doubt, it is God!
    <br>We don't need to struggle to believe.
    <br>Faith comes spontaneously, just naturally.
    <br>But today, we keep on struggling to believe.
    <br>You have to read Psalm 35 three times.
    <br>You wake up at midnight, you have your Bible under the pillow.
    <br>You set your alarm to wake up to say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>"He is alive, Amen..."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We don't need to struggle to believe.
    <br>Believing is natural.
    <br>Many of your children abandoned your house in the past.
    <br>They abandoned their families saying that their father is a drunkard.
    <br>They say they are born-again.
    <br>You could not find them but now suddenly, they are back to the world.
    <br>When you are struggling to believe, you will still come back to the world.
    <br>When you are struggling to accept Jesus, you will soon leave Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"If you struggle to believe Jesus, you will soon leave Jesus".
    <br>A good example: You lock a brother or sister who is a smoker or a drug-addict inside the house -
    <br>"You are not going to smoke or drink today".
    <br>You lock your son inside the house.
    <br>You say he must fast for three days.
    <br>It is not from his (heart).
    <br>It is not from his heart - to fast.
    <br>You know they are very tough.
    <br>You observe him now.
    <br>You have been telling him that he is a drug-addict.
    <br>You ask him to follow you to the church.
    <br>He says, "No, I am not going to church".
    <br>Any time you go to church, he would go to the club.
    <br>One day you set it up and call your pastor.
    <br>You deceive him and lock the gate.
    <br>Your pastor is there and says, "Three days fasting".
    <br>He says, "Please, I do not want to fast".
    <br>You say, "You must fast".
    <br>You have tried everything to force him to be delivered.
    <br>No, it is not possible.
    <br>Why are you telling him to come to church while he refuses?
    <br>You can pray for him and ask God to touch him.
    <br>Whilst he is in the night club smoking, he will just leave that place one day.
    <br>It could be caused by headache or something that happened, and it will bring him home.
    <br>After some time, he will come to his senses and say, "Mummy, I am sorry - I am tired of this life".
    <br>He will not know that it is because of your prayer.
    <br>Then, you take it up from there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many of us have tried it in the past.
    <br>You struggled to believe, but with time, it became worse in our righteousness.
    <br>We don't trouble to believe.
    <br>Belief is natural and spontaneous.
    <br>Let me tell you: When you work hard to get something and you cannot get that thing, it is very frustrating.
    <br>You work, you labour, and at the end of the day you cannot achieve that - it is very frustrating.
    <br>But when you don't work hard, you leave it naturally...
    <br>Look at what I said:
    <br>Work as if everything depends on you and pray as if everything depends on God.
    <br>Things of God are a decision.
    <br>You just sit down and say, "God, I am tired of my former life. I want to take a new life".
    <br>It is simple.
    <br>Make a decision and start your prayer from there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Our relationship with God â€“ this is a question of the heart.
    <br>In our heart, whom do we trust?
    <br>When we start praying now, you will begin to move your body.
    <br>How do we know that your heart is also moving like that?
    <br>If I say, "Amen", and all of you say, "Amen"; it is not all of you that say "Amen".
    <br>In truth and faith, before you can say, "Amen", you must believe with all your heart.
    <br>We do not serve our God with our hearts again.
    <br>Our relationship with God â€“ this is a question of the heart.
    <br>In our heart, whom do we trust?
    <br>If you know that, you will begin to get it right - because we are getting it wrong.
    <br>No matter how educated you are, if you apply your education to serve God, you get it wrong.
    <br>The person you trust in your heart is your god.
    <br>Whether it is a tree, palm oil or water - this is your god.
    <br>The person you trust in your heart is your god.
    <br>You say, "He is alive, Amen" - you keep saying that to God, whereas in your heart you don't trust God.
    <br>The person you trust in your heart is your god, not the person you worship.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart; faith is a heart that believes in God.
    <br>So, whom you trust in your heart is your god.
    <br>We donâ€™t trust two things with our heart but with our body, our confession, we can trust a million things.
    <br>With our heart, there is just one thing we trust.
    <br>If you have been trusting God with all your heart, God will be only, not one of those things.
    <br>When you plan to attend different events following your visit in the church - you are "comparing" God.
    <br>God should not be compared with anything.
    <br>If you have trusted God with all your heart, you will not compare Him.
    <br>You can never compare anything with what you trust with your heart.
    <br>With your mouth and confession, you can trust thousands of things
    <br>but with your heart, there is only one thing you can trust.
    <br>What you trust with your heart can move you from this place, as we are talking now.
    <br>If you receive a phone call, "Hello. That million dollars is ready now",
    <br>you would just ask your neighbour, "Where is usher here?"
    <br>They say, "This man is an usher".
    <br>"I am pressed."
    <br>Because we know how to lie.
    <br>If we want something, we can lie within a second.
    <br>Immediately you ask your colleague to help you, "I am pressed".
    <br>You may even say, "I have diabetes".
    <br>It is because you want to leave this place immediately.
    <br>They will now rush to call an usher for you.
    <br>You will not be the one to talk.
    <br>People will want to help you.
    <br>They will say, "Help this man. He is pressed".
    <br>In order to get your way, you will now walk like this until you get to the restroom.
    <br>The usher will show you, "This is the toilet".
    <br>"OK, thank you."
    <br>You will lock yourself there.
    <br>You will now call the man back, "You mean, what is ready? Because I couldn't hear you well.
    <br>T.B. Joshua was talking. There was so much noise".
    <br>Whereas you heard him well but you would like to hear it again, so it will gladden your heart.
    <br>"I said the 2 million dollars are ready. You can come immediately to sign the cheque
    <br>because I will be travelling to the UK this evening".
    <br>"OK - now!
    <br>Give me 2 minutes."
    <br>You will just rush out now.
    <br>You will abandon your car - a bike is very fast.
    <br>You have not been using bike for so long.
    <br>You just take a bike, you abandon your car, your wife and children.
    <br>You take a bike.
    <br>You call your wife, "Wait for me in the church. You may need to sleep there when they close."
    <br>That is the person you trust with all your heart.
    <br>What is that?
    <br>Money.
    <br>You can betray anything for the person you trust with your heart.
    <br>If you trust God with all your heart, your life would be better than this.
    <br>You cannot compare God with anything, once you trust Him with all your heart.
    <br>We are here today.
    <br>You say you trust God.
    <br>Even people who came from other countries - if there had been a phone call before you left,
    <br>that this contract, for which you had been looking for a long time, was ready to be executed,
    <br>you would have postponed your journey.
    <br>For you it is a matter of buying a new ticket and this contract would bring more money.
    <br>You postpone it till...
    <br>What you trust with your heart is only.
    <br>You donâ€™t compare anything with what you trust with your heart.
    <br>You just have to begin to trust God with all your heart today.
    <br>Heart is a place where you cannot trust two things; itâ€™s not possible.
    <br>It is not possible to trust both God and money in your heart.
    <br>That is heart for you.
    <br>You can confess, "Jesus is Lord", and confess other things at the same time,
    <br>but in the heart, only one thing is allowed to work there.
    <br>So, your relationship with God is a question of the heart.
    <br>In your heart, whom do you trust?
