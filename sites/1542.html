  <p>    
    <br>There is a gentleman who came here - a white man.
    <br>You were about to commit suicide before you came here.
    <br>This is the third time you attempted to commit suicide.
    <br>Please, don't joke with this. Please come out.
    <br>He is a white guy.
    <br>Four times you were about to commit suicide.
    <br>This is a family problem.
    <br>Please come out.
    <br>You need to be counselled after your deliverance finally.
    <br>Come out. Jesus loves you.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>My name is Shou Qiang. I'm from China.
    <br>I am the one the man of God prophesied that I was about to commit suicide three times
    <br>because of family problems.
    <br>It was really painful for me.
    <br>I have been suffering from this problem for a long time.
    <br>My wife and baby are here.
    <br>She can come and confirm.
    <br>You have listened to the gentleman.
    <br>He said he is the one the man of God prophesied about a while ago
    <br>when the man of God said there is a gentleman here,
    <br>he is about to commit suicide and for three times, he has attempted to commit suicide
    <br>and this is a family problem, he should come out, he needs counselling.
    <br>He said yes, he is the one and he has attempted to commit suicide three times.
    <br>This has affected his life and that is why he is here today to receive deliverance.
    <br>This is my wife and my daughter.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Shou Qiang from China.
    <br>This is my wife, and this is my daughter.
    <br>Last week, the man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied
    <br>that there is a gentleman that wanted to commit suicide before he came.
    <br>That was exactly true.
    <br>This is a family problem.
    <br>I have been praying for this prayer for a long time.
    <br>This is really my family problem.
    <br>After the man of God gave me the prophecy,
    <br>I realised, this is the biggest problem.
    <br>But because it was for such a long time, I ignored it.
    <br>But it is very dangerous for me.
    <br>I have been praying for a long time.
    <br>Once he reminded me it is a family problem,
    <br>it reminded me that my father's cousin committed suicide more than ten years ago.
    <br>On my mother's side, my mother's brother committed suicide just a year ago.
    <br>I was praying for this; thank God that this prophecy came to me.
    <br>I remember, more than one year ago, not too long,
    <br>I had a bad argument with my wife.
    <br>I was so upset and I went out to the road.
    <br>I just sat down beside the road.
    <br>For one second, I was just very near to being hit by a car.
    <br>But I felt a strong power holding me back.
    <br>Another force said, "Go and kill yourself! Hit the car!
    <br>Then my wife came out, and we reconciled.
    <br>We went to have dinner.
    <br>We crossed a bridge and at that moment, anger was still inside of me.
    <br>I almost just wanted to jump down the bridge.
    <br>Just a little bit - not very near to die. I thank God.
    <br>Even before we came here, four days before we came,
    <br>we went to get the visa for our baby.
    <br>But my wife lost the baby's birth certificate.
    <br>It was very important for our coming here.
    <br>If we didn't have the certificate, the consulate of Nigeria might not have given us the visa for the baby.
    <br>So we could not have come.
    <br>I was so worried about it.
    <br>I got angry and complained to my wife.
    <br>So we had a bad argument again.
    <br>On the way to the consulate, we were fighting on the metro.
    <br>My wife missed the metro but I and our baby went on the metro.
    <br>So we continued fighting via text messages.
    <br>That moment, the anger came out and a voice coming to my heart said,
    <br>"Go and die! Go and die with the whole family!
    <br>Go and die with the baby! Let your wife feel guilty". 
    <br>I felt like, "How can I do this?"
    <br>At this moment, another power, from God held me back again.
    <br>Then at that moment, a sister called me from the embassy, "Where are you brother?"
    <br>She told me to come back and I rushed to the consulate.
    <br>Then my wife also came there.
    <br>Thank God; the last day, the day of the flight, we got the visa.
    <br>I almost wanted to give up coming here.
    <br>I wanted to fund the flight ticket.
    <br>"I give up everything. Let's destroy it!"
    <br>Now I feel very free and very calm in my heart.
    <br>I was totally delivered.
    <br>When I prayed at the altar, my spirit felt awakening
    <br>and it led me to the beginning - a spiritual life.
    <br>I came back to my calling, mission, vision - everything came back.
    <br>I started like, "Oh, what have I done? I'm a preacher."
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I was seeking but a force was always distracting me.
    <br>I felt like something surrounded me and tried to distract my attention
    <br>to some negative things - many negative things.
    <br>It got me angry, caused troubles, problems, family problems, finances, many things.
    <br>So you mean it was after your deliverance, you came to realise
    <br>that what was tormenting you in the past, 
    <br>that made you to want to commit suicide, make several attempts was an evil spirit.
    <br>Yes, they wanted me to forget my vision, destiny, mission, calling,
    <br>destructing me in the end; they destroyed everything.
    <br>I would have killed myself and destroyed everything.
    <br>That was what the demon wanted to do in my life and family.
    <br>After my deliverance, I feel that hope has come to my life.
    <br>My vision started to be clear and my mind is much more positive.
    <br>I even think that the story with The SCOAN and the man of God T.B. Joshua is just starting.
    <br>I feel there is a destiny, a link to here.
    <br>Even bigger - I think the story is not finished; it just started.
    <br>It is about my destiny and China.
    <br>There are 1.4 billion people in China that are waiting for salvation.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I have a mission for this!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>My name is Mrs Quiang and I come from China.
    <br>This is my husband.
    <br>Last Sunday the man of God prophesied about a man who wanted to commit suicide three times
    <br>and it was because of a family problem.
    <br>I said, "Oh, it is my husband".
    <br>I can confirm that it is true.
    <br>Always when we had an argument, he was very sensitive.
    <br>He used to get angry and always wanted to kill himself.
    <br>But after the deliverance, he is more calm, more relaxed, and we are happy now.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>She says she can confirm that even when the man of God gave that prophecy last Sunday,
    <br>she knew that the prophecy was talking straight to the husband.
    <br>And she said after that deliverance last Sunday, the husband is calm now.
    <br>He is no more irritated and angry, and they live happily together as a family.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus one more time!
    <br>Mr Shou Qiang
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>I want to say, nothing is impossible with God.
    <br>Nothing is impossible with God. Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>This is a very bad problem.
    <br>I want to advise others who have the same problem I had,
    <br>who want to commit suicide or feel hopeless in their life or whatever situation you are facing:
    <br>Remember, hold the hand of Jesus and seek Him.
    <br>Never give up, go for it and find where they can help you,
    <br>that really have a high authority that can help you.
    <br>Then go for it; try your best to get it.
    <br>That is the only way that can help you to find a way out from your situation.
    <br>Hallelujah! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Amen! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
