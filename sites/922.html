    <br>Changing Lives
    <br>Emmanuel, viewers. I am Annette.
    <br>And my name is Chris.
    <br>Welcome once again to the program Changing Lives,
    <br>where we will take a deeper look into the lives of people
    <br>who have been touched by God Almighty  through the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Yes, indeed, we know that in life, experience is the best teacher.
    <br>And through these interviews, we gonna be guided in so many ways to learn some very valuable lessons of life,
    <br>to learn how people overcame their challenges, how they endured their pains,
    <br>and how at the end of the day they came out with a wonderful testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>Now, in today's program we shall be listening to Mrs Augustina Orakwe
    <br>and her husband Dr. Orakwe, a retired controller of prisons in the Nigerian Prison Services,
    <br>and doctor of Sociology.
    <br>Together they had some tough experiences in life, especially concerning some ups and downs
    <br>in their marital lives but through Christ they overcame even in the midst of that very difficult situation
    <br>through discovering  Emmanuel TV.
    <br>And today we are gonna take an opportunity to listen to their experiences.
    <br>We believe that through the testimony of this family, you will discover how marital bliss can be restored
    <br>and repaired, when we anchor our hope on the foundation of Christ.
    <br>Hallelujah! So you are all very welcome in Jesus' name to this program - Changing Lives.
    <br>It's a great privilege to have you with us today.
    <br>And we would like to start with our mother first.
    <br>If you would you can just introduce yourself to us and the people beside you,
    <br>and just share your testimony to our viewers to the glory of God.
    <br>My name is Mrs Augustina Orakwe.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband Dr. Orakwe. My left hand side man is my junior brother Chima Ozorumba,
    <br>and the wife Joy Ozorumba.
    <br>The problem that brought us to the SCOAN - we had problems in our marriage.
    <br>Years ago a voice came to me, telling me: "I will scatter your marriage."
    <br>But I didn't know how, but as a child of God I prayed and I forgot about it.
    <br>When my husband came back home that day, I told him that I heard a voice today
    <br>and what the voice said.
    <br>We also prayed and we left the whole thing like that.
    <br>But after I heard that voice, problems started in the marriage.
    <br>We started experiencing things we have not been experiencing before -
    <br>lack of trust in the marriage, so many challenges. Even this family idol had brought problems
    <br>not only in my marriage, but in the marriages of my siblings,
    <br>bringing people down. My eldest brother is a Russian trained petrol chemical engineer -
    <br>but nothing to show for it because of the family idol.
    <br>Because the family idol - on that day I received this deliverance - spoke that it had destroyed everybody.
    <br>And it's true.
    <br>Before we came to the SCOAN, like I earlier said, we experienced a lot of problems.
    <br>They themselves were experiencing several problems in their homes.
    <br>We never knew that it was the family idol.
    <br>So these problems continued on and on.
    <br>As a child of God, I went to so many places, praying, looking for solution but all to no avail,
    <br>until we came to the SCOAN because of watching of Emmanuel TV which my husband discovered.
    <br>So we started watching it. When we saw what God is doing in the SCOAN through Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>we now realized that our problems can be faced.
    <br>So that was how we came to the SCOAN and I thank God for His intervention.
    <br>When we came here that day, they ministered the New Morning Water on me
    <br>and the Holy Spirit took over and the family idol, spiritual husband started to speak.
    <br>Can you just describe what you experienced,
    <br>when that New Morning Water was ministered to you at that moment?
    <br>When the New Morning Water was ministered on me, I didn't know what happened.
    <br>I started talking... Even now, I am still thinking of how I got that word - "family idol".
    <br>The thing just came and started talking: "I have destroyed everybody, I have destroyed this, that marriages."
    <br>And it is true - no steady marriages in my family. Problems here and there.
    <br>We didn't know that it was the family idol that brought all these problems.
    <br>But thank God for Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua who submitted himself for God to use.
    <br>Because without him submitting for God to use him to deliver people, a lot of people would have gone.
    <br>But thank God for him.
    <br>So it was when we came here, that we got solution and I know, because of that deliverance on that day -
    <br>in fact, my siblings started getting testimonies.
    <br>And since that day, everything, my marriage is like we just started again.
    <br>Praise God.
    <br>Changing Lives
    <br>Praise God. It was wonderful.
    <br>And Doctor Arakwe, if we can hear from you, please.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23). I am Dr. Ifediora Arakwe. I am retired Controller of Prisons
    <br>and I hold a doctorate degree in Sociology.
    <br>And I served the prison service in Nigeria for 34 years.
    <br>In the course of my career, especially in the last 16 years, I had the privilege of being engaged
    <br>in international correction activities that took me around the world.
    <br>Before now we didn't know about Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We never heard about it. The only thing we heard about Prophet T.B. Joshua was in 1996,
    <br>when some pastors made some caustic remarks about him.
    <br>And you know, like everything evil, it went into the memory and settled there.
    <br>But as I started travelling around the world...
    <br>I am very sorry, sir, can you explain to us, you say 'caustic remarks' - what do you mean?
    <br>In 1996, some pastors in Lagos here said that people should not listen to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>In fact, it was printed in magazines that he was patronizing mummy water spirits and all that stuff.
    <br>When you say this type of thing, it easily settles in people's memory.
    <br>So nobody knew about Emmanuel TV; nobody knew about him.
    <br>That caustic remark in 1996 almost made us think no more of T.B. Joshua
    <br>and so it continued like that.
    <br>Even when this crisis came into my marriage, we were born again, we were believers,
    <br>we had a nearly perfect marriage but this issue that came up, this demonic attack in the family
    <br>almost tore the family to shreds.
    <br>I think that what was keeping us was our Christian confession.
    <br>So it continued and continued and continued and we were praying.
    <br>I must confess that even here in Lagos in the last six years, we were always coming for night vigil
    <br>every last Friday of January after 30 days fasting and praying.
    <br>And so I didn't know about Emmanuel TV. I didn't know about the SCOAN.
    <br>Like I said, I was involved in corrections, both internationally and locally and in Africa.
    <br>So it took me around the world but I started getting to hear about Emmanuel TV as far back as 2012,
    <br>when on one of our conferences in Uganda, a cabinet minister asked me -
    <br>because I was always dressed as a Nigerian, dressed in caftan, wearing the cap.
    <br>If the weather was sub zero cold, I would still wear it, then I would use winter jacket to cover up.
    <br>But I would always wear that Nigerian outfit. So the guy asked me: "Are you from Nigeria?" I said: "Yes."
    <br>The first person he asked me about was: "What about Prophet T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>I said: "Who is he?"
    <br>He said: "The man of God in Nigeria. Do you know him?" I said, I didn't know him.
    <br>So he said: "Your life must be miserable." 
    <br>- And he is government minister? 
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>So he said: "We have been to Nigeria. We had problems, we came to Lagos.
    <br>We came to Lagos and the man prayed and you are telling me you don't know about him."
    <br>I went to Barbados in 2009.
    <br>Somebody asked me: "How is Prophet T.B.Joshua?" I just waived him aside.
    <br>I went to Mexico, they said: "Senor, Prophet T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>I went to Singapore: "Nigerian! How is Prophet T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>Nobody was asking me about President Obasanjo or Goodluck Jonathan!
    <br>When I now had this experience in Uganda and the man's comment was like a rebuke,
    <br>I went back to my hotel room and turned on television and started watching Emmanuel TV.
    <br>In 2014 in South Africa, I addressed a conference of African Ministers of Interior.
    <br>One day, one from Zambia, when he was giving me a promise that he would invite me to Zambia
    <br>to come and look at the prisons, and see the changes, he now told me: "What about Prophet T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>So I came back and I told her, I said...
    <br>When I went to the hotel, I tuned the televison station straight to Emmanuel TV and started watching.
    <br>I couldn't sleep.
    <br>Changing Lives
    <br>Can I just ask you - what first went through your heart, when you first switched on the TV and watched Emmanuel TV ?
    <br>Well, I wanted to find out what the world was telling me about.
    <br>And it was happening in my own country, and I was ignorant of it.
    <br>It made me look very illiterate. It made me look very unschooled.
    <br>It made me look very foolish that ministers of cabinet level, will be telling me about
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua in my own country and I was kind of saying - I don't know.
    <br>As a Sociologist at that level, I should know.
    <br>So when I came back, I started watching. I said: "Madam, something is happening and we are missing it."
    <br>She said: "What?" I said: "Look at the television."
    <br>So we saw deliverances.
    <br>I want to confess - that was when my heart became very bitter.
    <br>That was when I became pained. And even I will ask the Prophet to pray for me,
    <br>so that that bitterness will go away.
    <br>Because I felt that some people were deliberately tarnishing the man's image
    <br>so as to prevent Nigerians from getting the best spiritually and physically from the deliverance here.
    <br>So I felt, I want God to forgive me. I really was angry.
    <br>So you would agree, sir, that what a danger in ignorance.
    <br>That is why it's happening.
    <br>I was telling you about my sister in law who is in Ejigbo here - just 100 Naira bus away.
    <br>I had to drag her to this place because when I said: "Your husband has been out of job for eleven years
    <br>and you were told that it was an affliction.
    <br>And you stay there but just to come here, you say - they told you the man is... Well, come here."
    <br>I am glad she came and got the first New Morning Water testimony on Sunday.
    <br>And I don't think anyone can put her away from Emmanuel TV, from the SCOAN.
    <br>So that's my pain.
    <br>But from that 2014, when we started watching it steadily, I came to the conclusion that
    <br>whatever it was - I had physical problems, my heart and hypertension - it was there.
    <br>When we came here in March, I got Morning Water and I was ok.
    <br>And I told her we were going to come again.
    <br>When we came in March, the man of God didn't have time to touch people.
    <br>We collected the Morning Water and left. We had our testimony.
    <br>But we still wanted to come back. We wanted one on one.
    <br>So when we came this time, we didn't see him, we were disappointed,
    <br>although the New Morning Water was ministered.
    <br>Maybe, because of the disappointment, the faith did not click.
    <br>Then, she suggested and I agreed that we stay another extra week.
    <br>Then we fasted and prayed for three days before that Sunday. The only prayer point there was:
    <br>"May we see this man of God; may we have an encounter with him."
    <br>When we came to the church that day, there was ministration of the Morning Water
    <br>but there was general church service.
    <br>Then I think an announcement was made that they were going to minister New Morning Water,
    <br>after that we can go.
    <br>I was a little depressed and I told her. I said: "Since we have got the Morning Water,
    <br>maybe after this Morning Water let's go back to Abuja. We have exhausted our resources, let's go back".
    <br>But little did I know that the Morning Water that was coming that day was the new one that had power and potency.
    <br>The moment it was ministered onto her, she went into skyline.
    <br>I knew deep inside me that what was happening to my wife was spiritual.
    <br>She would offend me and I would tell her what she did, and she would say she didn't do it.
    <br>From my experience on Emmanuel TV and the people that had been previously delivered
    <br>I knew that deep inside me that what was wrong, was spiritual.
    <br>It was only the Morning Water that brought the confirmation
    <br>and I want to tell you that after that Sunday we are husband and wife again.
    <br>It is just like when it was at the beginning.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>And the pain is that we didn't come earlier. And that's why I spoke.
    <br>And I am going to use this opportunity to speak again to tell - not the foreigners.
    <br>Because when the man of God went to Mexico, he was received presidentially.
    <br>He went to Paraguay, Uruguay, Botswana, Ecuador, Singapore, look at Indonesia.
    <br>That is almost 90% Muslim. Look at South Korea.
    <br>Everywhere he is received but in this country where he is domiciled, he is not acknowledged.
    <br>He is not acknowledged. It is a terrible thing.
    <br>And I want to address pastors. They say they are Christians but do not acknowledge
    <br>that this man has the grace of God to deliver and to save.
    <br>They should allow that he is not asking for their congregation.
    <br>He is not asking for their members.
    <br>They should please tell their churches the truth, so that the people who are suffering under various
    <br>yokes can come here and be delivered, they should not lie.
    <br>So many people out there are under that yoke like I was being told: "Don't go to T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He is this, he is that".
    <br>T.B. Joshua is a genuine man of God whom God is using in this generation to do impossible.
    <br>To deliver people and to save them by the power in that name.
    <br>And anybody that is preventing you from coming here to seek deliverance from spiritual,
    <br>from physical, from every other yoke is not helping your business line.
    <br>That is the advice I want to give to Nigerians.
    <br>And I am using this medium to let them know that they are suffering because of ignorance.
    <br>The Bible says: "My people perish because of lack of knowledge."
    <br>I have come here and the yoke that held my family and my extended family hostage has been broken.
    <br>And if I had come here five years ago, I wouldn't have ended my career the way I did.
    <br>I served the prisons for 34 years, I was stagnated for nine years.
    <br>At the beginning, I was stagnated for 12 years, I retired as a controller of prisons,
    <br>while people who were less gifted were promoted to Deputy Controller General.
    <br>And I know that by the grace of God, I contributed immensely to turning the face of Nigerian prisons
    <br>around, both within the country and internationally.
    <br>I didn't know it was this demonic force in my family.
    <br>I am telling you who are out there, who is there listening to me right now - come to... Not that there is no God,
    <br>there is God in all churches but grace is imparted upon several people according to their faith.
    <br>Here is a man given to us in this generation by God.
    <br>People are spending thousands, hundreds of thousands dollars to fly from other parts of country
    <br>to come and get what God has given us in Nigeria, and somebody is telling that it's not available.
    <br>Please, for Christ's sake, come and be  baptized and be delivered. Praise God.
    <br>Changing Lives
    <br>We thank you, sir. We know that a lot of people have actually watched and seen the deliverance of Mrs Arakwe
    <br>and have actually commented and sent lots of emails concerning your testimony.
    <br>We would like to read a couple of questions that have been received,
    <br>so we basically have questions from some of our viewers,
    <br>we have time just to read perhaps one or two.
    <br>So we have one from Kelly from Australia and Kelly asks: "As a doctor of Sociology,
    <br>would you have considered your marital problems to be a spiritual issue?"
    <br>Well, as a Christian, Jesus - when He was asked about tax, He said - give what belongs to Caesar to Caesar,
    <br>and what belongs to God to God.
    <br>And I even read political economy.
    <br>In my doctorate dissertation I applied Maximin principles in solving social problems, but that is there.
    <br>But when it comes to spiritual work, I believe God. No academic consolation comes in,
    <br>not for one moment.
    <br>So you realize that despite your education, this was a spiritual issue
    <br>that required spiritual solution.
    <br>Jesus said - give that which belongs to Caesar to Caesar and that which belongs to God to God.
    <br>And that is where I stand.
    <br>My academic convictions, my academic profession can not...
    <br>The Bible says that God has chosen foolish things of this world to confound the wise.
    <br>If I apply academic wisdom in this matter, I will derail. I will just move 100 degrees off my target.
    <br>When you want to come, you come by faith and the faith that moves is the faith in Christ Jesus,
    <br>delivered unto us. Not the law - because if the law were to come in,
    <br>which is conterminous with academics, then Christ died in vain.
    <br>Wow, thank you.
    <br>And we have another question as well; this is from Mr Nigel who is actually in Holland, from Netherlands.
    <br>And he asked: "If this problem had not happened in your life and family,
    <br>do you think you still would have found out more about Prophet T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>Yes. Actually we came here because we had that problem but it took us time.
    <br>We got into this watching Emmanuel TV in 2014 and this is 2017.
    <br>We also had enough faith to believe the man of God, when he is praying
    <br>that we could lay hands on the television and get healed.
    <br>We only came here because we felt this thing was becoming an irritant.
    <br>It was making us look like we were no longer the Christians.
    <br>So we now came here, so that on this mount, we could drop everything and continue our work.
    <br>But it wouldn't have meant anything because when we got glued to that television
    <br>and the marvelous work God was doing here, there was nothing like going back.
    <br>There was no going back.
    <br>Changing Lives
    <br>So at this point we want to hear a few words from Mr Chima, which is the brother of Mrs Augustina.
    <br>So Chima, can we hear from you? I heard that you also have a great testimony concerning a breakthrough.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you, my sister.
    <br>My name is Chima Ozerumba, a business man. I live in Abuja.
    <br>And the person beside is my wife Joy Chima Ozerumba.
    <br>We have been in this journey for so long.
    <br>It's just like when the Israelites were crossing the biblical Jordan - it wasn't an easy thing.
    <br>We have gone to so many pastors - they would even see your intestines but they didn't have solution.
    <br>They didn't have solution. But I thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Immediately my sister called me that I should come,
    <br>that she had that deliverance, a lot of things started happening.
    <br>A document I had been looking for, for two and half years - I said: "God."
    <br>The next thing I said, I heard an instate: "Go to your jeep."
    <br>I went to my jeep, opened the door - I saw the document there.
    <br>A lot of things have been unfolding themselves.
    <br>Because of this family idol we have suffered setback - even my brothers and sisters.
    <br>My sister said the actual thing but today we have reached our promised land.
    <br>All those contracts - people have been calling me concerning those documents they called me so many times -
    <br>if I want them to start it afresh. I said I had not done it, so that they could please do it.
    <br>I didn't know that it was the deliverance my sister had. All these things have started unfolding itself.
    <br>Thank God for Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Well, as Prophet T.B.Joshua says: "Whether we plant or water, in Christ we are a team."
    <br>So we believe that God has gifted pastors in different ways. We just give glory to God that it was when you came here,
    <br>that God really opened that door for breakthrough in your family,
    <br>in such a wonderful way. So lets just finally hear a word from our sister as well here.
    <br>What would you like to say about this breakthrough in the whole family?
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>We thank God for today.
    <br>I am Mrs Joy Chima Ozerumba.
    <br>And Augustina is my sister-in-law.
    <br>We thank God for the manifestation of the family idol. The family idol has dealt a great blow in that family.
    <br>It has killed his younger brother, his elderly sister. It has done a lot of harm.
    <br>No breakthrough. Even our son would do WAEC - no results.
    <br>They would seize it and he is very brilliant.
    <br>JAMB - they seized it.
    <br>The day my sister in-law called us, invited us to come,
    <br>that she manifested family idol, I brought his birth certificate, laid it on the floor.
    <br>The New Morning Water was sprinkled on it. The next day he got admission.
    <br>He is in school now. We have been fighting. We spend 500-600 thousand looking for schools for him.
    <br>We have started seeing a lot of breakthroughs.
    <br>I had a pain, a great pain at my spinal cord. I got that Morning Water.
    <br>The thing flew till today. I had a very big boil. I don't know where the boil came from.
    <br>My blood sugar was 401. When I came in contact with the New Morning Water, the thing came to 73.
    <br>I was not eating rice. I didn't eat anything - even no carbs in my diet.
    <br>But since we came, I have been swallowing rice; they were even shouting asking me what is this.
    <br>Thank God for the deliverance.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>To change physically, spiritually and the marriage - in fact, every department of this family.
    <br>Glory be to God. So I think at this point, lets just hear a final word of advice
    <br>from our mother who was the one who actually received that deliverance from the New Morning Water,
    <br>that opened this wonderful door of breakthrough for the whole family.
    <br>So madam, to cap of everything. What is your advice to our viewers?
    <br>My word of advice to viewers all over the world is that when you have this kind
    <br>of problems, don't go away, don't run away from God, run to God.
    <br>Watch Emmanuel TV. It is the faith booster, that is what I call Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Because if you watch it, you will know that your solution must come in the SCOAN.
    <br>That's my advice to viewers all over the world.
    <br>Amen. Thank you so much to the family. And viewers, you heard it from our mother.
    <br>She said Emmanuel TV is faith booster. And we really believe your faith has been boosted,
    <br>has been lifted up by this wonderful testimony.
    <br>And you know, there are several important lessons of life to be learnt.
    <br>We know that in the Christian home, Christian home does not just happen -
    <br>it is built. A Christian home is like a high school of learning,
    <br>where so many truths about life are really learnt. And one of the lessons
    <br>that we really learnt from this experience is that personal fulfillments and improvements in life
    <br>come through the continual process of learning from both positive and negative experiences in life.
    <br>Yes, indeed, we all face spiritual entities  that cause crisis in our marital life, our family
    <br>and our careers. And the tool for these spiritual entities is simply offense.
    <br>Yes, when we feell offended, we begin to use our tongue
    <br>out of bitterness, out of anger and hatred to split churches,
    <br>shatter marriages, crush close relationships and tear homes apart.
    <br>Yes, and we know the Bible says - God is actually the Owner, the Author, the Originator
    <br>of relationships. So since relationships begin with God
    <br>and then overflow to people, we can't just quit from relationships under any circumstance.
    <br>Unless God himself releases us because the beautiful thing about God is that
    <br>He can speak strength through weakness. He can speak strength to us through challenges,
    <br>through difficult circumstances, through all of these issues that arise in our marriage.
    <br>God can actually speak joy in the midst of sadness.
    <br>And in a Christian home, we know that there can be no agreements without disagreements.
    <br>So that disagreement will lead to a higher level of agreement in Christ.
    <br>Indeed, and also there can be no understanding without misunderstanding.
    <br>It might be that this program has gone a long way to let us know
    <br>that even if your marriage is on the verge of divorce, there is hope, and that hope is in Christ Jesus,
    <br>the Anchor of our souls. So viewers, we thank you for watching this program
    <br>Changing Lives. We believe that as you are watching you are learning some secret truths
