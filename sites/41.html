    <br>BISOLA JOHNSON: TB Joshua's Accuser EXPOSED!!!
    <br>The one who eats My food has turned against Me.
    <br>I do not speak concerning all of you.
    <br>I know whom I have chosen.
    <br>Now, I tell you before it comes, that when it does come to pass you may believe.
    <br>Most assuredly I say to you, one of you will betray Me.
    <br>Lord, who is it?
    <br>It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.
    <br>Judas.
    <br>What you must do, do it quickly.
    <br>Do you betray me with the kiss?
    <br>Having taken the bread, satan entered and possessed Judas Iscariot.
    <br>As it was, so it is.
    <br>Watch and pray.
    <br>If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated Me first.
    <br>Remember the words I spoke to you, no servant is greater than his master.
    <br>If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you also.
    <br>Look, the hour is near.
    <br>Rise, let us go.
    <br>Here comes My betrayer.
    <br>BISOLA JOHNSON: TB Joshua's Accuser EXPOSED!!!
    <br>Beware of Betrayers
    <br>Looking at the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>it is evident that he has been blessed with the gift of prophecy.
    <br>He is being used as a mouthpiece of God, revealing prophetic messages to individuals,
    <br>nations and the world at large.
    <br>Every Sunday, he is used as a communicator between the visible and the invisible worlds,
    <br>speaking, warning of events to come.
    <br>What does Prophet T.B. Joshua have to say about the situation at hand,
    <br>the blasphemous lies that have been circulating about him?
    <br>Had God not shown Prophet T.B. Joshua what is happening now?
    <br>As the Book of Amos 3:7 says, God does nothing without revealing it to His servants the prophets.
    <br>If God has shown him the happenings around the world,
    <br>surely, He would have shown him what is happening close to home.
    <br>The Holy Spirit sees far ahead.
    <br>Let's listen to the prophecy that Prophet T.B. Joshua gave to the congregation
    <br>on that Sunday, in 2004.
    <br>Remember the workers and evangelists in the house of God.
    <br>Remember them in prayer.
    <br>Pray that Lord Jesus should keep strengthening them for the task ahead.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>I am a man of vision and mission.
    <br>Write it - there will be betrayers among my workers.
    <br>But greater is He that is in me.
    <br>God has shown me the name and the step and everything.
    <br>The betrayers may stop for now because the prophecy has come.
    <br>My time has not yet come.
    <br>There will be betrayers but pray for the betrayers.
    <br>We heard Prophet T.B. Joshua instructing the congregation to pray for the workers at The SCOAN
    <br>because he saw that there would be betrayal.
    <br>The man of God said that because of the prophecy
    <br>the betrayal he saw would not take place immediately
    <br>but that after a while the whole thing would start.
    <br>He encouraged all listening that although this betrayal would happen,
    <br>because of the grace of God, nothing would happen.
    <br>Grace in the soul is a new life in the soul.
    <br>God often prepares His people for temptation before He calls them to it.
    <br>He will not leave us without direction and He will not leave us without a Father.
    <br>To a man of vision, no matter what constitutes the obstacles on his way,
    <br>he can never be stopped.
    <br>After that year, listen to what happened.
    <br>This is Bisola Johnson when she first came to The SCOAN.
    <br>An insecure, unstable young woman.
    <br>I have been in the town since 1981.
    <br>It is like falling into a bad category - bad friends.
    <br>There was a time that I was living in the Eko Meridian hotel
    <br>for about three years, permanently living there.
    <br>The place was for me; money was for me; everything was for me.
    <br>I smoked for 14 years.
    <br>When I went back to school, my boyfriend was smoking marijuana,
    <br>so we started having it together.
    <br>When I left school, I started work and I was transferred to Kano.
    <br>That was where I really started moving round.
    <br>I was with two governors.
    <br>Some of the commissioners knew my house and we would do business together.
    <br>I collected money but there was no peace; there was no happiness.
    <br>So, I left them and settled with my husband.
    <br>She recounts her past life of associating with bad friends
    <br>and questionable relationships with different men.
    <br>She said that she was living in Eko Meridian hotel,
    <br>in a permanent suite for several years,
    <br>saying that the place was for her, money was for her, everything was for her.
    <br>She said that she smoked for 14 years, taking marijuana.
    <br>Yet, she was accepted into The SCOAN.
    <br>What should one have expected from her?
    <br>This is Bisola Johnson when she left the ministry over one year ago.
    <br>But where has Bisola Johnson been for the past one year?
    <br>Today, she is spreading lies to the world at large,
    <br>as if she left The SCOAN only yesterday.
    <br>All this is in a vain effort to coax people into accepting her deceitful stories.
    <br>This is a woman who tried using different means to spread a web of lies and deceit
    <br>concerning The SCOAN.
    <br>This DVD is one of the mediums in which she narrates a fabricated tale
    <br>of how she said she came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Some 14 years ago, I came to The Synagogue Church.
    <br>At this time my family just recovered from a fire outbreak in our home.
    <br>At that particular time, we needed God and we needed help.
    <br>My father's friend introduced him to The Synagogue Church,
    <br>mainly because of my father's malignant sickness.
    <br>He came and invited some of his children and many of them turned down the invitation.
    <br>Unfortunately, I would say for me, I came with him.
    <br>You have heard the story that Bisola gave,
    <br>after she had turned her back on The SCOAN.
    <br>Now you are about to watch actual footage from The SCOAN's archives
    <br>of how Bisola truly came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Let us go back to the time many years ago,
    <br>when in a hopeless state she revealed what had really brought her to The SCOAN.
    <br>Please, I want to do everything to please God and to please you
    <br>because of what God has done for me.
    <br>Tell us what brought you initially to this church.
    <br>And what God saved you from.
    <br>God saved me from the spirit of death.
    <br>Before, every time I always think of death. I always dream of death.
    <br>Even when I was working, any time I am in a position, I have a terrible dream -
    <br>they always demote me or something always happens.
    <br>I have tried seven times to get married but it didn't work out.
    <br>I have even used money in buying people. It doesn't work out.
    <br>This is a stark contradiction of her former tale,
    <br>that she had merely come to The SCOAN after her family were recovering from a fire outbreak,
    <br>and as she stated, because of her father's malignant sickness.
    <br>Whereas, in actual fact, driven by the spirit of death,
    <br>she arrived at The SCOAN desperately seeking deliverance.
    <br>What could possibly have led Bisola to invent such a tale?
    <br>We believe this will be the question that will be going through your mind.
    <br>Watch the following footage and find out.
    <br>What is the problem you have with your brain?
    <br>I always have a terrible headache which is called, migraine.
    <br>Any time it happens, I always misbehave.
    <br>I don't care about what happens in my surroundings.
    <br>I always behave irrationally.
    <br>I don't care about what happens to me next.
    <br>Tell us what normally happens to you and the experiences you have
    <br>when this migraine comes.
    <br>I always have terrible nightmares.
    <br>So, these nightmares always haunt me.
    <br>I don't regard anybody.
    <br>I just behave the way my spirit dictates to me.
    <br>Anything my spirit says, I will just do it.
    <br>If you have ever experienced a migraine,
    <br>you will know what effect it has on your ability to reason well.
    <br>What you have just heard is enough to discredit any story Bisola may have spread.
    <br>As she confessed that when that migraine headache comes upon her,
    <br>she has no regard for herself, let alone her surroundings or anyone else.
    <br>This is Bisola being prayed for.
    <br>BISOLA JOHNSON: TB Joshua's Accuser EXPOSED!!!
    <br>Here she is being prayed for a second time.
    <br>BISOLA JOHNSON: TB Joshua's Accuser EXPOSED!!!
    <br>I always have a terrible headache which is called, migraine.
    <br>Any time it happens, I always misbehave.
    <br>I don't care about what happens in my surroundings.
    <br>I always behave irrationally.
    <br>I don't care about what happens to me next.
    <br>I don't regard anybody.
    <br>I just behave the way my spirit dictates to me.
    <br>Anything my spirit says, I will just do it.
    <br>In a subsequent confession, Bisola publicly discloses what this irrational behaviour
    <br>had once led her to do.
    <br>My name is Bisola.
    <br>In my family, they worship satan.
    <br>Whenever I sleep, a snake will bite me on my hands and I will lose all the money that I have.
    <br>Because of that frustration, I had to go and get married.
    <br>For more than 2 years we were married and we were always fighting.
    <br>It is like some invisible people were living in the house with us.
    <br>Then one day, my husband said he was no longer interested in the marriage.
    <br>So, I drank poison and my husband rushed me to the hospital.
    <br>After two weeks, I poured kerosine and petrol on the house and set it on fire,
    <br>burning over three million naira worth of property.
    <br>- You burnt the whole house?
    <br>- Yes, the whole house burnt.
    <br>Including all of the property inside?
    <br>Yes, everything including my property and his property.
    <br>Is your husband the owner of the house?
    <br>We rented it. It was a two bedroom flat.
    <br>You mean, you burnt the whole house?
    <br>Yes, even the roof fell down.
    <br>Why didn't you burn in the fire?
    <br>In fact, I don't know. It was God that saved me because I drank a full bottle of alcohol
    <br>so that I would be too drunk to walk out of the house.
    <br>Later, I found myself in the hospital.
    <br>I explained to the police that I was the one that burnt the house because I wanted to die.
    <br>I don't know the kind of evil spirit that is disturbing me.
    <br>They detained me and my husband spent over 200 thousand naira to bail me out.
    <br>If he had not, they said I was supposed to spend 17 years in prison.
    <br>She said her name is Bisola.
    <br>She lives in Kano, Nigeria.
    <br>In her family they worship satan.
    <br>Whenever she sleeps, a snake will bite her on her hands
    <br>and she will lose all of the money that she has.
    <br>Because of that frustration she had to go and get married.
    <br>For more than two years they were married and they were always fighting.
    <br>It is like some invisible people were living in the house with them.
    <br>Then, one day her husband said that he was no longer interested in the marriage,
    <br>so she drank poison and her husband rushed her to the hospital.
    <br>After two weeks she poured kerosine and petrol on the house and set it on fire,
    <br>burning over three million naira worth of property.
    <br>These are the wounds she suffered from the fire.
    <br>The man of God asked, "You burned the whole house?"
    <br>She answered, "Yes, the whole house burnt".
    <br>"Including all of the property inside?"
    <br>"Yes", she said, "Everything including my property and his property."
    <br>The man of God asked, "Is your husband the owner of the house?"
    <br>She said that they rented it, that it was a two bedroom flat.
    <br>The man of God asked, "You mean, you burnt the whole house?"
    <br>"Yes" she said, "Even the roof fell down."
    <br>"Why didn't you burn in the fire?" the man of God asked.
    <br>She said that she did not know, that it was God that saved her
    <br>because she made sure she drank a full bottle of alcohol
    <br>so that she would be too drunk to walk out of the house.
    <br>Later, she found herself in the hospital.
    <br>She explained to the police that she was the one that burnt the house down
    <br>because she wanted to die.
    <br>She didn't know the kind of evil spirit that was disturbing her.
    <br>They detained her, and her husband spent over 200 000 naira to bail her out.
    <br>If not, they said that she was supposed to spend 17 years in prison.
    <br>Recall Bisola's earlier statement that she had come to The SCOAN
    <br>after her family were recovering from a fire outbreak,
    <br>whereas the truth of the matter is that she was the one who had single-handedly burnt the home
    <br>where she and her husband lived.
    <br>Then one day, my husband said he was no longer interested in the marriage.
    <br>So, I drank poison and my husband rushed me to the hospital.
    <br>After two weeks, I poured kerosine and petrol on the house and set it on fire,
    <br>burning over three million naira worth of property.
    <br>- You burnt the whole house?
    <br>- Yes, the whole house burnt.
    <br>Including all of the property inside?
    <br>Yes, everything including my property and his property.
    <br>Is your husband the owner of the house?
    <br>We rented it. It was a two bedroom flat.
    <br>You mean, you burnt the whole house?
    <br>Yes, even the roof fell down.
    <br>One day, her husband said that he was no longer interested in the marriage,
    <br>so she drank poison and her husband rushed her to the hospital.
    <br>After two weeks she poured kerosine and petrol on the house and set it on fire,
    <br>burning over three million naira worth of property.
    <br>These are the wounds she suffered from the fire.
    <br>The man of God asked, "You burned the whole house?"
    <br>She answered, "Yes, the whole house burnt".
    <br>"Including all of the property inside?"
    <br>"Yes", she said, "Everything including my property and his property."
    <br>The man of God asked, "Is your husband the owner of the house?"
    <br>She said that they rented it, that it was a two bedroom flat.
    <br>The man of God asked, "You mean, you burnt the whole house?"
    <br>"Yes" she said, "Even the roof fell down."
    <br>Is this the behaviour of somebody in their right mind?
    <br>Is this the kind of person who we should believe,
    <br>someone who said that in their family they worshipped satan?
    <br>In my family, they worship satan.
    <br>Someone who said with her own mouth that she acts irrationally,
    <br>regards nothing and no one, not even her own life?
    <br>I always have a terrible headache which is called, migraine.
    <br>Any time it happens, I always misbehave.
    <br>I don't care about what happens in my surroundings.
    <br>I always behave irrationally.
    <br>I don't care about what happens to me next.
    <br>Can we trust someone who said when these migraine headaches come upon her,
    <br>that she follows the dictation of the evil spirit that torments her?
    <br>I don't regard anybody.
    <br>I just behave the way my spirit dictates to me.
    <br>Anything my spirit says, I will just do it.
    <br>A woman who said that she took kerosine and petrol and burnt her husband's house.
    <br>These are the wounds that she suffered in the fire.
    <br>There was a time that I was living in the Eko Meridian hotel
    <br>for about three years, permanently living there.
    <br>The place was for me; money was for me; everything was for me.
    <br>I smoked for 14 years.
    <br>When I went back to school, my boyfriend was smoking marijuana,
    <br>so we started having it together.
    <br>A woman who said that she lived in the hotel, in a permanent suite for several years,
    <br>who smoked for 14 years taking marijuana.
    <br>What can one expect from such a person?
    <br>During her stay at The SCOAN, there were occasions where Bisola's rebellious attitude
    <br>and dishonest conduct had led her to walk out on The SCOAN,
    <br>only to come back some time later, pleading for forgiveness.
    <br>My name is Bisola.
    <br>I have acted as an enemy of God rather than a friend.
    <br>I am coming today as a prodigal daughter so that God will forgive me
    <br>and the man of God will forgive me and the whole church, Synagogue,
    <br>will forgive me and help me out of my human limitation.
    <br>Instead of humility, I have been very proud, I have been aggressive.
    <br>I keep malice.
    <br>I do all kinds of things that are not worthy of a Christian.
    <br>Sister, can you start all over again?
    <br>We are very sorry; we have a little technical problem here.
    <br>My name is Bisola.
    <br>I have acted as an enemy of God rather than a friend.
    <br>Today I am coming back as a prodigal daughter so that God will forgive me,
    <br>so that the man of God will forgive me and the church, Synagogue.
    <br>Instead of humility, I have been very proud.
    <br>I have been aggressive.
    <br>I have been rebellious.
    <br>When I left The SCOAN, nobody asked me to leave.
    <br>I am asking God to forgive me.
    <br>This is another time that Bisola returned to The SCOAN,
    <br>after having committed several grievous atrocities.
    <br>Man of God, please.
    <br>Please, help me!
    <br>I have no other place to go.
    <br>Please, help me!
    <br>What are the things you used to do?
    <br>I am stubborn. I am proud. I lie. I do all kinds of things. Please, help me!
    <br>I am the worst sinner here. Please.
    <br>I need forgiveness, please.
    <br>Everybody please.
    <br>You all know me but I have changed.
    <br>Something has touched me.
    <br>One life in Christ is all I have.
    <br>Please help me, sir.
    <br>People find it difficult to believe you.
    <br>I have changed.
    <br>Please help me, sir.
    <br>Help me everybody. I have changed. Just give me another trial.
    <br>- Shall we give you the last chance?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>This should be the last chance.
    <br>I will never come to this place in this form again.
    <br>Pray for her.
    <br>In Jesus' name we pray.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We wish you good luck. We pray for you.
    <br>We join you to pray and we believe that the Holy Spirit will affect your words.
    <br>What you have just said now will come to pass.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>The piteous cries for help seem almost genuine,
    <br>but having been granted a last chance by the man of God
    <br>and having sworn in the presence of the man of God
    <br>and all the evangelists and workers of The SCOAN that she had changed
    <br>and would never again return to them in this form,
    <br>Bisola's appalling acts and contemptible character only seemed to get worse.
    <br>Showing no sign of remorse or repentance after the pardon had been granted,
    <br>it was this behaviour that finally compelled Bisola to leave The SCOAN once and for all.
    <br>It was after she left that she began to spread lies and fabricated stories
    <br>about her contact with The SCOAN.
    <br>A woman who confessed that she came from a family that worshipped satan -
    <br>how could you expect such a person to praise the child of God.
    <br>In my family, they worship satan.
    <br>As the Bible says in Matthew 12:25:
    <br>"Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them:
    <br>'Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined,
    <br>and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.' "
    <br>In John 8:44, it says that satan is the father of lies, and he has children, sons and daughters.
    <br>Who is now a child of God and who is a child of satan?
    <br>The Bible exhorts us to examine all things in the light of God's Word.
    <br>And as it tells us in Psalm 12:2, everyone lies to his neighbour,
    <br>their flattering lips speak with deception.
    <br>Whom shall we believe?
    <br>We should therefore make sure of all things
    <br>and hold fast to that which is true.
    <br>Jesus Christ said, "And you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free."
