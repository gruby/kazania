    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities which cause crisis in your lives.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua together, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan killing, stealing and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen, right now.
    <br>ENGAGE WITH GOD
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>I count you for blessing.
    <br>I count you for deliverance, breakthrough and blessing.
    <br>Be counted, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>God counts His people.
    <br>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine - you are among them.
    <br>Be counted for breakthrough!
    <br>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine - you are one of them.
    <br>Be counted for breakthrough and deliverance!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, begin to count yourself.
    <br>Count your name,
    <br>count your neighbour,
    <br>count your friend,
    <br>count your partner,
    <br>count your family,
    <br>count your company.
    <br>Begin to count your people.
    <br>For that blessing, God is counting His people.
    <br>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve -
    <br>begin to count your people, count your family, count your partner,
    <br>count your family, your neighbour, your sick brother, your sick sister, your sick partner.
    <br>Count them for healing,
    <br>count them for deliverance,
    <br>count them for blessing.
    <br>Be counted for breakthrough!
    <br>Be counted for deliverance!
    <br>Be counted for blessing, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>BE COUNTED!
