    <br>How great You are
    <br>Lift your hands!
    <br>How great You are
    <br>If you know that He is greater than anything today, lift your hands and say:
    <br>How great You are
    <br>It's so simple. Just open your lips and say, "How great You are, Jesus!"
    <br>How great You are
    <br>You are so great to us, Jesus! We love You!
    <br>How great You are
    <br>You are so great to us, Jesus!
    <br>How great You are
    <br>We worship You! We adore You, Jesus! You are so great!
    <br>How great You are
    <br>Agbanilagbatan
    <br>Great Deliverer
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Somebody scream!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Agbanilagbatan
    <br>Great Deliverer
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>You may have your seat. Thank you.
    <br>Agbanilagbatan
    <br>Great Deliverer
    <br>That is the last word - Agbanilagbatan.
    <br>That is God for you. He is not a man.
    <br>Agbanilagbatan
    <br>Great Deliverer
    <br>That is God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He is not a man.
    <br>When He says, "Yes", it is yes; no one can say, "No".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to salute our viewers all over the world for your time. Thank you very much.
    <br>Wherever you are, Jesus is there. The state of your heart matters; distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Are you there, my viewers?
    <br>Yes. Thank you.
    <br>God gave me a Word for you today.
    <br>That quickly leads me to the book of Psalm 66 which I'm going to read for you right now.
    <br>The book of Psalm 66.
    <br>"For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver.
    <br>You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.
    <br>You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water,
    <br>but you brought us to a place of abundance."
    <br>Listen to that again. Let me read that verse 12.
    <br>"You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water,
    <br>but you brought us to a place of abundance."
    <br>This means God refines us with affliction.
    <br>It means sin easily hides where there is no heat of trial and affliction,
    <br>just as impurities hide in gold unless it goes through the furnace.
    <br>Impurities will hide in gold.
    <br>I was trying to ask a gentleman in the church - I believe he will be in the church today -
    <br>after calling and calling, I said, "Can you trace this man inside the church?"
    <br>Later, I got to know that the man did not come to church today. I said, "Why?"
    <br>Because he has a knocked engine.
    <br>He got up in the morning and found out that the vehicle's engine knocked.
    <br>That should be the reason.
    <br>As if the God that gave the vehicle cannot withdraw the vehicle.
    <br>The God that gave the vehicle to you cannot as well withdraw it?
    <br>When He noticed what only He Himself knows -
    <br>nobody knows the reason; He can decide to withdraw what He has given you.
    <br>God Himself. That is God for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When God noticed what only He has knowledge of - nobody knows the reason;
    <br>but He knows that if He allows this man to take this vehicle today,
    <br>something worse might happen to him.
    <br>So because of that, something will happen to the vehicle to preserve the man, to protect you.
    <br>To preserve him for the greater...
    <br>But because of this, our brother did not come to church.
    <br>He said, "Ah, the engine knocked".
    <br>"Hm, the engine knocked?"
    <br>That was the only reason given.
    <br>This is the manifestation of sin which hides where there is no heat of trial.
    <br>Manifestation of weakness.
    <br>When there is no heat of trial and temptation, you look so nice and gentle.
    <br>Very godly. It is too early to say, "Eh, this is a pastor, this is a bishop, this is a born-again".
    <br>"This is..." - whatever you call the name.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let the heat of trial come before you judge, before you say, "This is T.B. Joshua,
    <br>this is Prophet T.B. Joshua, this is a bishop".
    <br>Allow the heat of trial and temptation come. Then you can say that he is a bishop.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your fellow Christian brother there what he does not want to hear and hear the reaction.
    <br>"He is a born-again".
    <br>You know that he is a pastor or whoever - your neighbour inside the church.
    <br>Just tell him what he does not want to hear at all and see his reaction.
    <br>Let will tell you that he is a born-again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your weaknesses hide where there is no heat of trial and temptation.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Your weaknesses hide where there is no heat of trial and temptation.
    <br>Sin hides where there is no heat of trial and temptation.
    <br>You see a man, very nice and quiet.
    <br>"Hm, he is quiet."
    <br>Ok. Tell him what he does not want to hear and see his reaction.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Where there is no heat of trial and temptation, our weaknesses hide.
    <br>As if we are truly born-again.
    <br>Indeed, let temptation come.
    <br>Let someone lie against you. Let us see how you handle the situation.
    <br>Your response to offence matters - determines your future.
    <br>Your response to temptation, heat of trial, affliction determines your salvation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't forget the case of Job.
    <br>Before satan went to Job, he first consulted the Almighty God to give him permission.
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>Ask God to help you make the most of difficulties.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>They are not meant to destroy you.
    <br>It may be to refine you.
    <br>I want to tell you:
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>Because we don't know and it is difficult for us men of God to preach this -
    <br>because how do we preach it?
    <br>I listen every day, all the time, to this message but it is so difficult.
    <br>This is my personal experience.
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life, your adverse circumstances
    <br>for the purpose of cleansing and separating us from unclean and impure elements
    <br>such as anger, bitterness, unforgiveness.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes. Take this quote.
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>You ask God all the time to help you to make the most of difficulties.
    <br>Help me as You did Joseph.
    <br>You know what Joseph went through before the palace, before the throne.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Potiphar's house - you know what happened.
    <br>Pit - you know what happened.
    <br>Ask Him, "Help me, Lord, as You did Joseph to make the most of difficulties".
    <br>Help me in my adverse circumstances to make the most of difficulties.
    <br>All these that make you cry, lament, depressed - they are there to preserve you.
    <br>It is time you should begin to see adverse circumstances as a friend, not enemy
    <br>because oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>Your difficulty, sickness, disease, affliction, setback, attack.
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through them.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through them to take you to the throne.
    <br>He works through them.
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through my pain, affliction, setback - whatever you call it.
    <br>He works through them.
    <br>But when this comes, you lament, "Ah, this is the enemy! This is wahalla! This is trouble!
    <br>This is to destroy me!"
    <br>Time to be depressed, cry, lament, commit suicide.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you had not gone through that pain, who knows what would have happened to you.
    <br>If you had not been on the sickbed for a while, and you are out there,
    <br>going everywhere you want to go, who knows what would have happened to you.
    <br>If you had not run into debt at the time you run into debt,
    <br>who knows what would have happened to you if you had had the chance to move everywhere.
    <br>If you had got that pregnancy and had a baby,
    <br>who knows what would have happened to you whilst being in the pregnancy stage
    <br>or if you had that baby, who knows what would have happened.
    <br>If you had not been sacked from that place, who knows what would have happened.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>So it is now time for you to think about yourself.
    <br>Think about yourself.
    <br>"Ah! I was going from one witchdoctor to another because of this problem.
    <br>I never knew that God was working through it to take me to the throne!
    <br>I was looking at God in a very bad light!
    <br>'Ah, my God! What happened! Why did this happen?'
    <br>I never knew God was working things out for me through it."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So rise up right now and say after me with all your heart:
    <br>Lord, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Lord, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Lord, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Lord, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.
    <br>Do you know the reason? Because Jesus is Lord over your life.
    <br>That is why you need greater understanding of His heart.
    <br>If I'm right? Jesus is Lord over your life.
    <br>Am I right?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Who is Lord over your life?
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>Who is Lord over your life?
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>Open your lips and say to the Lord, "Give me a greater understanding of Your heart
    <br>because Jesus is Lord over my life!"
    <br>"Because You are the Lord over my life,
    <br>give me a greater understanding of Your heart!"
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>You know, if you ask many people here today, "What is your dream?"
    <br>They say, "No, I don't even understand whether I dream.
    <br>I don't even understand the word 'dream'".
    <br>And God gives dream to guide us for this life.
    <br>To guide you - it is for guiding.
    <br>He gives dream to guide us for this life.
    <br>Without dream, you will continue to walk in the dark, without direction.
    <br>People believe that they must sleep before they have a dream.
    <br>It is a thing of the heart.
    <br>Like you are standing now - dream is going on.
    <br>The thought of God - your heart is telling you, "Ho, yes, yes!"
    <br>This is why we are asking for a greater understanding of God's heart -
    <br>because Jesus is Lord over your life.
    <br>Ask God to help you to see the dream for you.
    <br>But not ask God for the dream - the dream is there already!
    <br>Some people will say, "Ok, ask for dream! Dream! I want to dream!"
    <br>No! Already! It is only that you are ignorant.
    <br>You can't understand the voice of God.
    <br>This is why I said to you that what you are going through,
    <br>is to separate you from (what is) unclean and impure such as bitterness, hatred.
    <br>A lot is going on in your heart.
    <br>Pain of the past, offence.
    <br>You need a greater understanding of God's heart to know that what you are going through,
    <br>God is aware.
    <br>God is working through your circumstances.
    <br>God is working through your sickness.
    <br>God is working through your affliction.
    <br>God is working through your setback.
    <br>You need a greater understanding of God's heart to understand this.
    <br>If not, you will continue to run to the witchdoctor, to join a secret cult because of your problem.
    <br>Run into this, run into that.
    <br>Making a covenant to the world.
    <br>Run into this and that because you don't understand.
    <br>You think this is a problem, this is satan to you
    <br>whereas oftentimes, God works through your circumstances of life.
    <br>See your dream, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus, see your dream!
    <br>You people pray for dream. Don't pray for the dream; it is there already.
    <br>As you are created, you are created with a dream.
    <br>Dream means direction. This is direction but you can't see.
    <br>But for you to ask now for direction, God should give you that...
    <br>No! The direction is there already!
    <br>See your dream, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>What is my dream? How will I get there?
    <br>Our walking with the Lord - good and hard times alike.
    <br>You are walking with the Lord.
    <br>Hard - good.
    <br>Hard could be sickness, disease, setback, temptation, affliction.
    <br>Good - bad.
    <br>That is our walking with the Lord.
    <br>Oftentimes, he works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>Good - bad.
    <br>This is how you are built.
    <br>In the same vein, day - night.
    <br>When it is night, you have to sleep.
    <br>That is how you grow and become old; through day - night.
    <br>You become strong in the Lord through good and bad.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You just need a greater understanding of God's heart to understand this.
    <br>Our walking with the Lord - good and hard times alike.
    <br>A lot of hard time whilst you are sacrified.
    <br>But reward, a lot of good - there will be hard time but so much good.
    <br>But sacrify - the word 'sacrify' - reward.
    <br>Sacrify - a lot of hard time.
    <br>Not that there will be good but a lot of hard time.
    <br>And you are sacrified now.
    <br>You have not yet reached the reward time.
    <br>Forget about your age.
    <br>When you reach reward time, you will begin to eat with the Lord, see vision clear,
    <br>have a greater understanding of God's heart.
    <br>As I'm standing now, you will be able to ... oh my God!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As I'm standing now, you will be able to know who is talking to you.
    <br>It is T.B. Joshua or Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>But right now, I don't think anyone knows who is talking to him.
    <br>You only see a man standing, called T.B. Joshua. You don't know who is talking to you.
    <br>That is why it is difficult for you to believe, unless the mighty grace comes upon you.
    <br>You need faith to believe.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I need faith to believe. Give me faith to believe".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>I need faith to believe. Give me faith to believe.
    <br>Who is going to give you faith?
    <br>God!
    <br>I need faith to believe. Give me faith to believe.
    <br>You need faith to believe. You don't just run into the church and say,
    <br>"They said I should come to the Synagogue today. Ok, I'm in the Synagogue.
    <br>I believe. I believe in what is happening here".
    <br>Oh, you believe? But you still need faith to believe.
    <br>Back again.
    <br>Dream is a gift of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Dream is a gift of God.
    <br>Some people say, "I want to dream".
    <br>Pray, fast. Fast, pray.
    <br>It is a gift. Something that is a gift from God.
    <br>Not the work of righteousness which you have done but according to His grace you dream.
    <br>It is a gift from God, just as faith is a gift from God.
    <br>That is why you say, "I need faith.
    <br>You can manufacture your belief but faith cannot be (manufactured)
    <br>because you must have that faith in the finished work of God.
    <br>Not in yourself - you can decide to believe.
    <br>"I believe the man. I believe the business."
    <br>But the word faith cannot be used that way.
    <br>See your dream, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>There is no way we can see our dream when in hard times, we lament.
    <br>You run to the witchdoctor, lamenting.
    <br>You stop praying; you stop even coming to church.
    <br>If God that gave you a vehicle decided to withdraw it,
    <br>when He noticed what only Him understands, is it a crime?
    <br>The One that gave you can decide to withdraw it.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>To test your faith, someone can just come to lie against you, to show your response -
    <br>those you kept inside.
    <br>To people, you are a man of God. To people, you are a born-again.
    <br>But let this temptation come and see how you react.
    <br>A lot of people have been in the court - you have sued them for this and that.
    <br>You never knew that God works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>That is why your response should be of God.
    <br>You can never hear me respond to any issue because I know how God works.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>See your dream, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>God gives dream to guide us in this life.
    <br>For this life, you need guidance.
    <br>"You will dream, dream, dream!" - that is the book of Joel.
    <br>But how many of you dream today?
    <br>Before even coming here, you are supposed to actually know what my appearance will be -
    <br>what kind of wears I will put on, and you will see it clearly.
    <br>By the time you see clear, you say, "Oh! This is actually what I saw it in the dream!"
    <br>to tell you, "Oh, yes. Today is your day!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is everywhere. It is with you.
    <br>It is for you. It is a gift.
    <br>You are born with it. Your dream is only dormant, unused - it is there.
    <br>So you take this message home today:
    <br>Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>Anytime you are having a challenge, think over it - the position of God - before you comment.
    <br>When someone lies against you, sit back.
    <br>Know the position of God before you comment.
    <br>When temptation comes, what is God's position?
    <br>All this divorce, divorce, divorce, everywhere broken home.
    <br>If you take time to know God's position, you will know that for 90% of this, God is aware.
    <br>God used this for a purpose - to preserve, to cleanse the house,
    <br>to separate them from unclean and impure.
    <br>See your dream, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Because Jesus is Lord over your life, see your dream, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>When you see your dream, you know God's position concerning your affliction, burden,
    <br>God's position concerning what you are going through, challenges, situation, condition.
    <br>See your dream, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You need to know God's position
    <br>because oftentimes, He works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>You know how He helped Joseph in adverse circumstances.
    <br>He helped Joseph. Look at the history of Joseph.
    <br>He was with Joseph, and you with God are majority.
    <br>See your dream, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>One thing we don't know about our enemy:
    <br>When they hit you, trying to attack you, and you are silent,
    <br>it creates fear to your enemy.
    <br>They will not know your position.
    <br>And they don't know what you mean by your silence.
    <br>But when you respond - they love response.
    <br>"Please, this is a secret!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your enemy loves your response. It gives them the next strategy to use.
    <br>When they kick you, shout at you, lie against you, and you come out to say,
    <br>"You lie against me!", they say, "Glory!". They are happy.
    <br>"He, we hit him! Hit him more!"
    <br>"He, he!"
    <br>"Oh, hit him more!"
    <br>The same way satan:
    <br>When you want to pray and you begin to say, "Satan, satan!",
    <br>satan will be happy. He always wants attention.
    <br>He want to hear the word 'satan' in your mouth.
    <br>He wants you to confess, talk about him.
    <br>When you don't talk about him, you just ignore him,
    <br>you are not even mentioning anything about him, it is always very painful to him.
    <br>Satan loves attention.
    <br>That is why I used to tell some of our members
    <br>when people are in a prayer mode and you now stand up, showing your shoes, stuff and all that,
    <br>I said they should help me in giving the names of people like that.
    <br>Satan is using them.
    <br>That is when they want to show off their stuff, attire, beauty,
    <br>you will see them moving around the church at a time people are quiet.
    <br>Satan likes attention.
    <br>When you ignore satan - you see me the way I ignore satan.
    <br>There is nothing you will say, unless God says, "Talk!"
    <br>When you just say something, I will be looking. I want to know God's position.
    <br>Even if God could not give me a response instantly, I'm always patient
    <br>because there is nothing I will gain in responding.
    <br>Because I depend on God's ability and power than man's majority.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God's authority is final.
    <br>You know, you need support...
    <br>So please, take note of that.
    <br>Your enemy loves your response.
    <br>That gives them next strategy and tactic to use.
    <br>When you don't respond, and they abuse, and curse you, whatever they say about you,
    <br>and you don't respond, that is the end of the matter.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Yes, that is their end.
    <br>But that is not God's end. Where they stop, God starts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So that is it.
    <br>From your response, they know how mighty, little, big you are.
    <br>When you talk, the enemy listens to your voice.
    <br>From your voice, they know the value of what you are saying.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes. So take note of this from today.
    <br>Your enemy needs your response. That is why they attack you.
    <br>And when you are quiet, they don't know what you are doing.
    <br>They are afraid. Your silence is very dangerous.
    <br>They too know God. It is only that they don't believe.
    <br>So when you are quiet, they are afraid that "Hey, this man might be migthy in the spirit"
    <br>because they know that you are a spirit man.
    <br>Are you not a spirit man?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Does the spirit talk?
    <br>[No!]
    <br>Eh hen.
    <br>So take this home today.
    <br>In summary, your enemy needs your response for attack.
    <br>To attack you next, they need your response.
    <br>So, take note.
    <br>When you don't respond, it means you have a big God who is fighting for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Every response of your enemy, take it God - take it for prayer.
    <br>If your enemy says, "You are a thief", write it down, take it to your altar.
    <br>If your enemy says, "You are stupid", write it down, take it to your altar.
    <br>Don't use your mouth to reply. Take it to your altar.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>By the time you have written down all the response of your enemy -
    <br>"I will kill you; I will destroy you" - just write everything down with the date.
    <br>"They will kill you; they will destroy you" - write it down and take it to the altar of God and say,
    <br>"I am a spirit; I am only living in a physical body, learning to live in this physical world".
    <br>So, what else again?
    <br>Take it to the altar of God.
    <br>Two: Oftentimes, God works through the circumstances of life.
    <br>Your adverse circumstances.
    <br>Oftentimes, many times.
    <br>These adverse circumstances you see as an attack from the enemy, from this, from that -
    <br>mighty God is using them for cleansing; to separate you from unclean and impure elements.
    <br>That you are silent and quiet does not mean that you are a Christian.
    <br>Very gentle, wearing rag - it does not mean that you are a child of God.
    <br>Christisnity lies in the heart.
    <br>What does your heart say?
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Give me a greater understanding of Your heart - that should be your prayer today.
    <br>That should be going on in your heart.
    <br>Give me a greater understanding of Your heart because Jesus is Lord over my life.
    <br>Because You are Lord over my life, give me a greater understanding of Your heart.
    <br>So, this is what you need now.
    <br>"Give me a greater understanding of Your heart" because you don't understand God's heart.
    <br>That is why when attack comes, you attack back, the same way.
    <br>And you never knew that oftentimes, the person that attacks you does not matter
    <br>but the position of God concerning the attack matters.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Oftentimes, the person that attacks me does not matter
    <br>but the position of God concerning that attack matters".
    <br>Yes, that is it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If Judas was not sent to betray Jesus and Jesus was not crucified,
    <br>today, we would not talk of the Saviour.
    <br>The person that attacked me, oftentimes, does not matter.
    <br>When you just say, "Ah, you attacked me!" - I look at him.
    <br>He does not even matter; he is being used to take you to the throne.
    <br>Many a time, the attacker is being used to take you to the throne.
    <br>He does not matter; he is just being used.
    <br>He is a particle.
    <br>But the position of God concerning that attack matters.
    <br>"What is Your position, God, concerning this attack?"
    <br>"Oh yes, this position is to cleanse and preserve you for the new level!
    <br>It is to strengthen your desire and your determination for me, God!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, these are the things we need to know.
    <br>Please, don't waste your time over your enemy
    <br>because he uses the content of your words to strategise.
    <br>"I will deal with you!"
    <br>"Eh hen!"
    <br>He wants to see those behindg you.
    <br>Silence is the best answer for a fool.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Silence is the best answer for your enemy.
    <br>Write it down.
    <br>Silence is the best answer for my enemy.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Silence is the best answer for my enemy.
    <br>Nothing makes you better than your enemy when you respond.
    <br>Nothing makes me better than my enemy when I respond.
    <br>"You are an idiot!" - "You too are an idiot!"
    <br>What makes you better now?
    <br>Who is now an enemy?
    <br>The two of you.
    <br>The two of you are now an enemy of God.
    <br>"You are an idiot!" - "You too are an idiot!"
    <br>Who is now the Christian among you?
    <br>Nothing makes me better when I respond.
    <br>The attacker does not matter many times
    <br>but the position of God concerning the attack matters.
    <br>Thank you.
