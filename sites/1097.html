    <br>Prophet T.B Joshua Ministering Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>I'm seeing a person inside you. You were attacked.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>There is a man inside you.(Yes sir)
    <br>It's like, you can love men, sexually and you can love women sexually.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Your wife has been with you for sometime, but she is disappointed now.
    <br>Yes, man of God!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus' name.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Patrick Busima. I am 45 years. I am from Uganda.
    <br>Before I confirm the prophecy ; what I am going to say today, I believe, it's going to set many people free,
    <br>who are in bondage of the same confession I am about to make.
    <br>Last time during the service,  through the Man of God, prophet T.B.Joshua,
    <br>the Spirit located me and he came to me
    <br>and he prophesied that I have an attack of a man inside me, that cause me to have
    <br>sexual affection for both man and woman.
    <br>And then he said  my wife  is very disappointed.
    <br>I confirm the prophecy to be true and I thank God who located me that day.
    <br>And today this morning , I am here to make a confession that will help set many people
    <br>who are in bondage without knowing.
    <br>Well, it started way back when I was at the age of seven years;
    <br>I was sexually abused by my elder brother.
    <br>Since then, I got a different spirit of getting  attracted to both men and women.
    <br>I grew up struggling. Later in life, I got a sign that will trigger to have these feelings.
    <br>I would have strong itching in my private parts.
    <br>When I scratch, that sexual urge will come over.
    <br>If there is any man seated next to me; I will feel strongly attracted.
    <br>No matter how he looks; handsome or ugly, as long as I have that itching ,
    <br>it will trigger the affection.
    <br>Just as the  like the prophecy was presented ; it is an attack that comes, once it comes;
    <br>these strong feelings are there.
    <br>I have struggled with them for the last 38 years.
    <br>Mr Patrick Prophecy Confirmation.
    <br>38 years living under this kind of bondage.
    <br>I have prayed. I have fasted to get rid of it because I had kept it to myself but not until
    <br>the spirit revealed it. I got my deliverance that day.
    <br>Ok sir, could you give us an example, perhaps you are in a public place
    <br>when suddenly, there is itching on your private parts
    <br>comes with a very strong sexual urge.
    <br>What would then happen at that moment?
    <br>It could be either in a public meeting or public transport, I begin have itching, the next
    <br>thing will be talking and having a conversation with a man near me.
    <br>I keep the conversation with the man to see if he can relate and be my friend. I keep talking about love affairs.
    <br>What you are trying to say, sir, is that at that moment you can not control yourself,
    <br>the urge is so strong that you would approach any man, be him ugly, handsome
    <br>just to satisfy that sexual urge.
    <br>Ya, at that point of cause you are possessed, the urge is so strong,
    <br>that you run desperately to speak to a man who is next you.
    <br>And that how it happens all these years.
    <br>Now, what were the various ways in which you found yourself getting entangled with
    <br>these men. Were you also, for example, using the internet to go out and meet some of these men?
    <br>Just share with us some ways in which you encountered with them.
    <br>The major way was just the physical meeting.
    <br>Apart from the internet; not very much on facebook and probably if I met one
    <br>and he would give my phone number to an other one. Who would call me to say: can I meet you
    <br>all this , is because you are in the same class.
    <br>So people of God, I hope we understand what our brother is saying, after he was sexually abused
    <br>at the tender age of seven, by his elder brother, that was how this strange spirits
    <br>of men entered him and he has been battling these sexual urges for his fellow men for 38 years.
    <br>And any time these urges would come, they would come in the form of strong itch
    <br>on his private parts which will be accompanied by that strong urge and in that minute, he is in a public place
    <br>he would be ready to approach men at any given point to try and try to begin a relationship with them,
    <br>which would later blossom into a sexual relationship with them.
    <br>I would like to say that this spirit has greatly affected my marital life just like it was said in the prophecy.
    <br>That we have stayed together in marriage for 20 years but it has been a big disappointment
    <br>in a way that; once I begin itching myself, maybe at night I go to the bathroom to bath,
    <br>I can spend like 20 minutes but the first 10 minutes  will be scratching myself heavily.
    <br>By the time I come to bed, I will not have any affection for my wife.
    <br>I will lose out an erection that I will not stand to have sex with her.
    <br>Slightly I doze off, a man will come in a dream will be having sex with me.
    <br>So for 20 years, you had zero affection for your wife as a result of this.
    <br>Now how were you managing this double life of being married and the same time
    <br>going after men in your personal time?
    <br>I would say it's quiet a challenging situation
    <br>because this is something that is within you.
    <br>You can not share it with another person.
    <br>I mean, you live a life of torture, but this attack, once, it comes, you would want to go out but
    <br>you are trying to conceal it yourself, it's just a life of torture.
    <br>My wife never knew about it, she got to know about it now, one and half month ago
    <br>that when she got to know about it.
    <br>How she got to know about it; she lost her phone
    <br>then I offered to give her my old phone to put her sim card, to use it.
    <br>Now when she activated whatsapp and that when she got to know
    <br>and to read a love message from one of the men I was communicating with.
    <br>She was mad and she said, she couldn't continue to be with a homosexual
    <br>and then that was like the man of God prophesied,
    <br>that was the hardest time and the divorce was the next thing that was to come.
    <br>So once your wife discovered this, one month and half ago, since then both of you have separated
    <br>because she was so angry as a result of this hidden life that she never knew about.
    <br>Yes. When she discovered, we separated.
    <br>So once again people of God we hearing this confession from our brother
    <br>which we believe serves as a great lesson for our viewers all over the world
    <br>and those present here now.
    <br>Brother you said, on your own, you tried to stop.
    <br>Can you just give us an idea of the effort you made to try and get out of this
    <br>and how each time you found yourself returning back to the same problem.
    <br>I tried efforts. Sometimes I would go in prayer and fasting
    <br>and I have tried to delete any connection I would of person who with this affection,
    <br>but all of a sudden, when I get these attacks, I will go back and search for these contacts,
    <br>to make sure we are communicating or we are talking.
    <br>Weeks before  even my wife discovered, I tuned on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>While I was watching, I watched a testimony of one person who had been delivered
    <br>from that spirit. I got  interested.
    <br>I even recorded it to really see that ok,
    <br>I can get deliverance if I go to Synagogue.
    <br>That increased my faith.
    <br>Even when my wife discovered it, one thing I told her was, give me an opportunity
    <br>to go to SCOAN and then we shall discuss other things.
    <br>That was all I could say.
    <br>Ok, so you told your wife that before going ahead with the final divorce;
    <br>you wanted to first come to the SCOAN
    <br>Yes, that's what I told her.
    <br>Ok sir. Tell us ever since the prophecy and deliverance
    <br>last week, Sunday what are the changes you have seen in your life?
    <br>I have seen a lot of changes. Of cause the attack of the itching, is no more.
    <br>I got delivered from the touch on Sunday. I have lived normally because what would
    <br>drive me  to the affection of my fellow  man was the itching.
    <br>I would even get a bathing sponge to make sure I am scrubbing heavily
    <br>before I will do anything. But since Sunday that is history, that is the past.
    <br>Mr Patrick Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>So the itching is gone, the affection, the attraction to your fellow males has gone.
    <br>And how have you been sleeping since the deliverance sir? You said before even in the dreams
    <br>these men would be abusing you sexually as well.
    <br>What has happened to you in that area since the deliverance?
    <br>I have slept comfortably. I have not have those strange dreams not even....
    <br>You know, I would sleep and my hand is kept here, but I am sleeping comfortably not knowing what's happening.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Mr Patrick Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>We give all the Glory to our Lord Jesus Christ for what he has done for our brother.
    <br>And in the light of the experience that our  brother shared after the word of prophecy
    <br>came forth last week; Prophet T.B. Joshua actually invited our brother's wife
    <br>to come here to the SCOAN all the way from Uganda.
    <br>By the Grace of God she is here in our midst.
    <br>We would like to invite her to come forward right now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So madam, you are very welcome in Jesus name.
    <br>We want to thank you for honouring the invitation of Prophet T.B.Joshua to be here this morning.
    <br>If you please introduce yourself to us and tell us what can you say concerning that prophecy
    <br>that your husband received last week.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1: 23)
    <br>Kevin Busima is my name.
    <br>I want to confirm the prophecy, but before that I want to thank Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for the invitation, for sponsoring me to be here.
    <br>Who am I to be sponsored in this whole world to be here today? I am so glad.
    <br>Praise Jesus! I am very honoured that  I was invited.
    <br>May God bless Prophet T. B. Joshua for inviting me here,
    <br>to confirm the prophecy.
    <br>On... one month ago, I discovered something.
    <br>But I have lived with Mr Patrick for the last 20 years in this marriage.
    <br>But we didn't have affection.
    <br>When I married him in the beginning it was ok. But after two years there was something
    <br>which was very strange.
    <br>We didn't have affection for each other. We used to sleep in bed but each of us at the edge of the bed,
    <br>you know these big beds. So there was no affection completely.
    <br>But we have been praying and believing God that maybe one day something will happen.
    <br>Me, I thought that Patrick was impotent and that is all I knew.
    <br>And we have been believing God. I didn't know his other side of the story,
    <br>until one month ago, like he said, I was in town, the thieves snatched my phone in traffic jam,
    <br>in Kampala.Then I didn't have another phone.
    <br>I had a phone but they were not giving out sim cards
    <br>so he gave me his phone. When I perused through whatsapp, I found that love message
    <br>with another man. Actually I ran mad, I was so angry.So what I did, I got a phone
    <br>I called him,  "You have an attraction to men."
    <br>He said yes. Then I just switched off my phone.
    <br>After switching off my phone, he kept on calling me. I didn't answer again.
    <br>I was just annoyed. I told him that now you come I want us to separate.
    <br>Then when he was on the way coming, I told him, "I don't want you to come here , I don't want to see you."
    <br>Then later on , he came. I said," Now what we have to do is for us to separate or we divorce."
    <br>But he said ,"Give me an opportunity, I have watched something on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Maybe I will be delivered, I will have total deliverance."
    <br>But even when he said like that, I said "Yes ok fine, I have forgive you because that is who you are.
    <br>But I want you to move from this bedroom, go to the guest bedroom."
    <br>That is what I did. So he has been living in the guest bedroom. Then I remained in the main bedroom.
    <br>And I have been so angered.
    <br>My life, my spirit has been grieved. I have had a lot of sorrow upon my heart.
    <br>Mrs Kevin & Husband Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Holy Spirit help me.
    <br>So we can really understand the emotions our sister is explaining, for 20 years
    <br>of marriage to suddenly discover the secret hidden life of her husband and the two actually
    <br>at a point of separation.
    <br>So now last Sunday after the church service, I switched on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>While I was seated in the chair watching, I saw the prophecy at that time.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesying that - you have a spirit of man, that loves man and women.
    <br>But of cause I had seen a love message but until I got that prophecy now.
    <br>Then now, I confirm that  it is true.
    <br>This man has been doing these things.
    <br>Now after that prophecy, I kept quiet. I thanked God that thank you for revealing this.
    <br>And then of cause I kept quiet. Now on Monday night at 11pm when I was in bed
    <br>about to sleep, I received a call.
    <br>When I got a call it was a number which is new . I responded but I couldn't really understand
    <br>the person who was calling me.
    <br>I kept on saying who are you. He said I'm evangelist
    <br>So you mean to say that on the following day, you received that invitation from the SCOAN
    <br>and that's how you are here today, to honour the invitation of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Yes that is how I'm here today, I received that invitation.
    <br>And I want to thank God that I am here and I believing to be delivered.
    <br>Because myself I am in state of confusion, I have forgiven him but
    <br>I want Prophet T.B. Joshua, Man of God to have an opinion about my state.
    <br>That I  have been in this marriage for all this time.
    <br>Because right now I am here and I'm believing God for deliverance.
    <br>Ok, so we understand your position our sister has taken here; that  she has forgiven her husband
    <br>and now she is here she wants to hear the opinion of God to know the next step to take
    <br>concerning the separation that she had already concluded on after this hidden life
    <br>in her husband was discovered.
    <br>So once again madam thank you very much for honouring the invitation of Jesus Christ
    <br>to be here today and we believe that Prophet T.B. Joshua will still come into this issue.
    <br>And reveal God's opinion for you to know how to move forward with your life and marriage in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>At this point we just want to hear another word from our brother
    <br>So sir what is your word of advice concerning this?
    <br>Mr Patrick & Wife Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Just like I said in the beginning that the confession, I am making is to help many people
    <br>who are struggling in bondage. It's a two ways:
    <br>there are those who are struggling with addictions and yet behind every addiction
    <br>there is a spirit that needs to be dealt with.
    <br>Then there are those who are living with these people who are in these spirits of addiction.
    <br>My word of advice to both parties, first to the people who are discovering people who have strange
    <br>behaviour or character; before we rush to pass judgement over them,
    <br>we need to recognize what could have been the cause, what is behind this.
    <br>These people need a lot of love.
    <br>For example; Prophet T.B. Joshua since I came, he has shown me love
    <br>from the time of the prophecy. I extended my stay in this place. I have seen deliverance
    <br>because the Spirit recognized the evil spirit in m, and it was  dealt with
    <br>so let's not rush into judging people who are struggling in all forms of addictions,
    <br>homosexuality, lesbianism, drug addict, there is something hidden that needs to be dealt with,
    <br>and also you may be there but struggling in one or the other with something that you have hidden yourself.
    <br>Many of us we have hidden, for example  I have stayed for 20 years with my wife,
    <br>but she didn't know that I'm struggling with that spirit until
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was able to prophecy on me and the spirit came out, I am now delivered.
    <br>Mr Patrick & Wife Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>And finally sir what is the last word you would like to say to your wife as you are here in the presence of God?
    <br>My last word, I want to say to my wife is this ;
    <br>First of all I ask you again to forgive me. This has been a struggling journey.
    <br>But today as we speak, it's life in the past.
    <br>The day I stepped in the arena of liberty and the prophecy came upon my life,
    <br>It changed everything.
    <br>I am not the pas,t but I am in the present.
    <br>Mr Patrick & Wife Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>One other thing is; it's not that I don't love my wife,
    <br>I really love my wife. That's one thing.
    <br>I want to confirm to you that days before I came  to SCOAN, when she had discovered
    <br>if you gave me a second chance to go to SCOAN, I know I will get deliverance
    <br>and we can have and we can rebuild our lives.
    <br>I am appealing to her and to the Spirit of God,
    <br>because we have come to the arena of liberty, that whatever happened in the past
    <br>may not be carried today's present life and lets move out as new people, new couple.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So once again we are going to rest this case right now to hear the opinion of God
    <br>from Prophet T.B. Joshua. We are very sure that both husband and wife will return
    <br>to share a wonderful testimony in Jesus' name.
    <br>And people of God we want the advice that our brother gave to serve as a lesson
    <br>to those present here and all around the world.
    <br>There are many people who are under the influence of such evil spirits and
    <br>it's easy for people to look at their actions on the outside and judge or condemn them,
    <br>but at the end of the day if we judge them, how will they be saved and how will they be delivered?
    <br>So people of God let this serve as a lesson to us that we as Christians,
    <br>we should hate sin but love sinners.
    <br>And definitely through love, that's how we can bring about deliverance
    <br>for people who  are under the torments of such spirits.
    <br>But if we judge them, treat them as outcasts, disassociate ourselves from them
    <br>How will they be helped and how will they be changed?
    <br>So once again let's let this serve as a lesson to our viewers all over the world.
    <br>As Prophet T.B Joshua says, if we fail to realise that there are spirits that cause us to be bound
    <br>down in bondage we will continue to fight the wrong battle. Fighting flesh and blood.
    <br>Fighting brother and sister, fighting neighbour, husband and wife but if we realize that
    <br>the spirit is the one behind it, we will deal with it spiritually and get a lasting solution.
    <br>And we pray that this couple will continue to maintain the deliverance and make the Word of God
    <br>the standard for their lives in Jesus' name.
    <br>Testimony Continues
    <br>My name is Patrick Busima. I come from Uganda
    <br>The woman next to me is my wife.
    <br>And I came here on the 20th of May, 2018.
    <br>And the problem that brought me here was seeking deliverance.
    <br>Because I had lived a frustrated life.
    <br>Life of rejection and I didn't know the cause.
    <br>But during the mass service, and the Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied to me
    <br>that I have a spirit of man living within me that causes affection to both woman and man.
    <br>I confirm that it was true. And again also said that your wife you were living with for long time
    <br>is disappointed, which was true.
    <br>And in the very service, the same prophecy, he invited my wife to come.
    <br>And I am glad that my wife came and we just met prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>We are happy that the past is gone. We have reconciled. My wife has forgiven me.
    <br>We are newly wedded couple and we are believing for the best.
    <br>And we promise we are coming back the same place with a bigger, bigger testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>Amen! So let's briefly hear from your wife.
    <br>Emmanuel people of God.
    <br>Kevin Busima. The man next to me is my husband Patrick Busima.
    <br>I came here on invitation of the Prophet.
    <br>And I want to thank God that God has used Prophet T.B. Joshua to bring deliverance to our family.
    <br>We have been married for 20 years but our marriage has been pambe (swahili word meaning to cheat)
    <br>But I want to thank God. I had a lot of bitterness
    <br>But when we met Prophet T.B. Joshua , he has counselled us, he reconciled us.
    <br>I want to thank God that he has intervened in our marriage. I'm now happy.
    <br>And I love my husband and I have forgiven him.
    <br>Mrs Kevin & Husband Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Thank you Jesus. We rejoice with both of you greatly and right now we want to
    <br>briefly hear a word of advice from our brother.
    <br>My word of advice is this;
    <br>Given my situation, it was not easy to explain to another person, because it was quite embarrassing.
    <br>But sometimes when someone gets to know about somebody's situation,
    <br>it turns out to be a gossiping situation.
    <br>All I want to say is; If you know a person who has such a bad experience, all you need to do is
    <br>stand with that person in prayer. Pray for that person that God's intervention at the right time
    <br>will happen and this person will get deliverance.
    <br>And once deliverance comes, this person will be a new person because what he is,
    <br>is not by his own wishes but there is a force behind just like in my case.
    <br>I had a force behind that could drive me to be... just those who have watched my prophecy
    <br>that my testimony, you can really see the details on how the force was driving me
    <br>into doing what I was able to do.
    <br>And worse still I had kept it as a secret from my wife until the prophecy came.
    <br>So people listening and watching, love the people and pray for them.
    <br>Avoid passing judgement. It is very bad, once you judge,  you are stepping and standing in the position of God.
    <br>Because God loves all. Let's hate sin but  let's love sinners.
    <br>I think that's the message I can give to those who are watching and viewing now
    <br>Otherwise thank you so  much. We pray that God bless this ministry
    <br>to continue really helping people who are travelling from afar seeking deliverance to this place.
    <br>I want to say thank you Jesus. Thank you for the deliverance. Thank you for the reconciliation.
    <br>To my marriage and thank you so much and we are new.
    <br>And we are coming back here to testify of God's goodness.
    <br>The advice  I would like to give is that, whenever we are confronted with this situations,
    <br>we have to wait upon the Lord. We should not be quick to go for separation.
    <br>Because for us we were into the house of God to seek God's intervention for what
    <br>he was saying about our situation. And in deed when I was at the time of testimony,
    <br>that is what I requested - what is God saying about this relationship of ours.
    <br>And I am happy that God has been able to say something and he is still saying something for us.
    <br>And I would like to advice all couples out there that let us always listen to God before
    <br>we rush to make the decisions in our marriages because for us as Christians
    <br>our battle is not by  flesh or blood but it is spiritual.
    <br>So we have to always pray and let God always be in the lead and give us direction always.
    <br>Thank you very much. We know with what you have said, it's a clear proof that
    <br>experience is the best teacher and having advice all our sundry, we believe couples out there have learnt
    <br>lot of lessons. As you go as a couple to make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>We pray that this relationship has been reconciled back to stay, remain permanent in Jesus' name.
    <br>And always, have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough
    <br>the best is always yet to come in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you Jesus!
    <br>Mr Patrick & Wife Prophecy Testimony.
