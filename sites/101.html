  <h3>101 - Be All God Has Called You - T.B. JOSHUA SERMON</h3>
  <p>    
    <br>Who is like You Lord in all the earth
    <br>Matchless love and beauty endless worth
    <br>Nothing in this world can satisfy
    <br>Jesus You're a cup that won't run dry
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Who is like You Lord in all the earth
    <br>Matchless love and beauty endless worth
    <br>Nothing in this world can satisfy
    <br>Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>All my days on earth I will await
    <br>The moment that I see You face to face
    <br>Nothing in this world can satisfy
    <br>Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated - thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Wow, what a wonderful atmosphere.
    <br>I am blessed.
    <br>What an awesome atmosphere.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>BE ALL GOD HAS CALLED YOU
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "be all God has called you."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Be all God has called you.
    <br>If you want to be all God has called you to be,
    <br>you've got to spend time with Him and learn from Him at His feet.
    <br>And learn at what?
    <br>At His feet.
    <br>The main thing about Christianity is not what we do.
    <br>You spend all your time on fasting and prayer - fine
    <br>You preach everyday in three, four churches.
    <br>They send you from one place to another - it is good - fine.
    <br>You pay your tithe - fine.
    <br>You sleep in the church - fine.
    <br>All this - fine.
    <br>It is not what we do but the relationship we maintain
    <br>and the atmosphere produced by that relationship.
    <br>If you say you have a relationship with God,
    <br>that relationship must definitely produce an atmosphere.
    <br>What we do for God is only a reflection of the relationship we have with Him.
    <br>What we do for God is only a reflection of the relationship we have with God.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "what are you doing with God?"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>(What are you doing with God?)
    <br>What are you doing for God?
    <br>What are you doing with God?
    <br>What are you doing for God?
    <br>What you do for God is only a reflection of the relationship you have with Him.
    <br>What I am doing is only a reflection of the relationship I have with Him.
    <br>What are you doing with God?
    <br>What are you doing for God?
    <br>Let's hear the song.
    <br>Be All God Has Called You - T.B. JOSHUA SERMON
    <br>Who is like You Lord in all the earth
    <br>Matchless love and beauty endless worth
    <br>Nothing in this world can satisfy
    <br>Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence is Heaven to me
    <br>You listen to that?
    <br>To have the presence of God, you must have a great relationship.
    <br>A great relationship brings about great works.
    <br>What we believe today is: "I am working for God" - that is our language.
    <br>Instead of saying: "I am working for myself", we say: "I am working for God.
    <br>I am an evangelist. I am a Christian. I am working for God. I am a deacon. deaconess, pastor, bishop.
    <br>I am an usher. I am a Christ's worker. I'm going to church."
    <br>Some say they're in the church for God.
    <br>And it is because he has nothing else to do out there.
    <br>If there was anything to do out there, they would not be here today.
    <br>If you receive a very serious phone call
    <br>that somebody is ready to pay you billion dollars
    <br>you would just walk out of this place.
    <br>Just a phone call:
    <br>"Hello, they are ready to pay you that billion dollars."
    <br>OK, hold on.
    <br>Usher, please - where is the restroom here?
    <br>He says he is going to the toilet.
    <br>But he is not going to the toilet.
    <br>He would now enter the toilet and say, "Hello, I can't hear you clearly.
    <br>What are you saying?"
    <br>He heard him clear, but that language is our friend.
    <br>"They are ready to sign the cheque now. Where are you?"
    <br>I am very close - whereas he is not close.
    <br>He is not close, he is very far.
    <br>He says he is very close because he wants to delay them.
    <br>OK, don't worry.
    <br>He just walks out - he is going.
    <br>Where is he going?
    <br>The prayer of T.B. Joshua has been answered.
    <br>If my prayer is answered, would you leave me inside the church?
    <br>"I will come back and give the testimony."
    <br>"We will build the church on the another side"
    <br>"This church is too warm - we need more air-condition - I can buy central AC"
    <br>What we do for God is only a reflection of the
    <br>relationship we have with Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>(What we do for God is only a reflection of the relationship we have with Him.)
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>What you do for God, you claim you do for God or do with him in whatever way:
    <br>"I am an Evangelist, I am this, I am that, I am a prayer warrior , I am an intercessor."
    <br>You donate to charity , help the needy, you help the widows,
    <br>you give trillion dollars to support the work for God.
    <br>All these are a reflection of the relationship you have with Him.
    <br>Let's go to our Bible.
    <br>Romans 8:27 NKJV
    <br>"Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is."
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>This means that the Holy Spirit has a mind.
    <br>When you say "a road" - it means there are many roads,
    <br>but when you say "the road" - it means its the only.
    <br>"Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is."
    <br>The Holy Spirit has a mind.
    <br>We have the mind of Christ.
    <br>We have what?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>We have the mind of Christ, that is, the mind of God.
    <br>The mind of Christ is an independent mind.
    <br>Satan hates an independent mind.
    <br>The mind that will think for itself.
    <br>Satan hates an independent mind.
    <br>That is, the mind that is determined to find out from God the truth.
    <br>He is a good listener but he will listen to you ...he will still find out
    <br>from God before taking action.
    <br>Satan would want you to take all you hear without question.
    <br>Satan wants to take what?
    <br>Before you came here; you know the way you see this ministry before coming here.
    <br>You said, "I must go there to see by myself".
    <br>Coming here you see differently.
    <br>If you have an independent mind, a mind that will think for itself,
    <br>a mind that is determined to find out from God the truth,
    <br>you would not have said all sort of things.
    <br>"Over my dead body. I would never step in this place"
    <br>But today you are here.
    <br>... because we are ready to take all, without finding out...
    <br>Don't be afraid to say, "I do not know," if you donâ€™t know.
    <br>If you know, say, "I know".
    <br>That is the mind of Christ.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>A person has the power to decide.
    <br>"Where am I going? Where would I go; here or here...?"
    <br>That is, exercising the will through the mind.
    <br>Exercising what?
    <br>The will through what?
    <br>The mind.
    <br>"Which direction should I take? I will go there."
    <br>The Holy Spirit has the power of choice.
    <br>The Holy Spirit has the power of what?
    <br>Of choice.
    <br>But you - the power you have... to decide.
    <br>Decide now.
    <br>I will take this one, or let me take this one.
    <br>But the Holy Spirit has the power of choice.
    <br>How do we know who is speaking?
    <br>When a pastor...
    <br>Because that name, sometimes may be a title.. or divine...
    <br>If I come out and say, "I am a pastor, I am a prophet, I am a bishop", and I begin to talk,
    <br>how do we know who is talking?
    <br>The Holy Spirit has a mind.
    <br>This means there is also another mind one can talk through.
    <br>This shows also that there is another mind.
    <br>One can stand to say, "Jesus is Lord" but it is not the voice of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>"Jesus is Lord" and it is the voice of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>How do we know the one that is the voice of the Holy Spirit
    <br>and the one that is not the voice of the Holy Spirit?
    <br>Be healed in Jesus' name!
    <br>It will sound the same.
    <br>Even the one that is not of Holy Spirit will sound better than the one that is of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>When you hear it fluently, smoothly,
    <br>"Oh my God" - on the outside very smooth...
    <br>But how do we know the voice of Holy Spirit, in these two;
    <br>"Be healed in Jesus' name!"
    <br>the end will know.
    <br>"Be healed in Jesus' name!"
    <br>If the person is healed - this is the voice of Holy Spirit.
    <br>"Be healed in Jesus' name!"
    <br>If the person is not healed - out of his unbelief
    <br>This can be said out of what?...unbelief.
    <br>And this means that a person is talking.
    <br>A person has the power to decide.
    <br>"I will go this way. I will say this. I will not say this. I will do this. I will not do this."
    <br>A person has the power to decide.
    <br>The Holy Spirit has the power of choice.
    <br>Take note of these two words.
    <br>A person has the power of speech.
    <br>S P E E C H.
    <br>The Holy Spirit speaks.
    <br>Open the book of Acts 8.
    <br>Let's look at what happened here.
    <br>Acts 8:29 NKJV
    <br>"Then the Spirit said to Philip, 'Go near and overtake this chariot'."
    <br>We all know chariots.
    <br>"So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah,
    <br>and said, 'Do you understand what you are reading?'"
    <br>This means
    <br>a person has the power of speech.
    <br>The Holy Spirit speaks as He wills.
    <br>We have the mind of God, the mind of Christ,
    <br>an independent mind.
    <br>Satan hates an independent mind,
    <br>the mind that will think for itself.
    <br>"What are you saying? - You say this, OK."
    <br>What I am saying now - you listen to me,
    <br>if you have an independent mind, you listen to me you will now examine all what I have said.
    <br>What are you examining it for?
    <br>You want to know whether a person that is talking or a prophet that is talking.
    <br>There are two persons; a person and a prophet.
    <br>You need to examine all this.
    <br>Look at what they saying.
    <br>The Christian Community; it seems we are all hung
    <br>On the last day, if a change does not come,
    <br>to many Jesus will say, "I don't know you".
    <br>If a change is not coming to the Christian community...
    <br>A change must come.
    <br>Holy Spirit must intercede now,
    <br>because it is getting worse.
    <br>What is getting worse?
    <br>Many of us are serving God we do not know.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by "serving  God that we do not know"?
    <br>God - you cannot hear from Him, and He cannot hear from you.
    <br>We believe so much in what we do with God and do for God, but we never knew that it is merely a reflection
    <br>of the relationship we have with Him.
    <br>The Spirit of Father must come now and intercede before it is too late.
    <br>And it is getting too late now in Christian community.
    <br>What do I mean by "getting too late"?
    <br>Many are serving God they do not know.
    <br>We believe that when you pray God heal me and you are healed, that is the answer
    <br>There is another, greater answer, that is better than that.
    <br>The best answer is for you to hear from God.
    <br>When you begin to hear from Him, you'll begin to know God's opinion
    <br>about yourself and about others.
    <br>Look at what we are reading here.
    <br>A person has the power of speech.
    <br>The Holy Spirit speaks as He wills.
    <br>A person has the power to decide.
    <br>"Where am I going. I will pray later; at 6 o'clock I will pray.
    <br>because of the nightmare let me go and pray.
    <br>Because of the attack I am having, let me open my Bible and put it under the pillow."
    <br>That is a decision, you decided not Holy Spirit this time.
    <br>You open your Bible, place it on your chest and sleep with it, because they are attacking you every day.
    <br>You decide when to pray.
    <br>40 days, 40 nights is coming - you know the time and when it will be - it's in the calendar.
    <br>What we do with God is only a reflection of the relationship we have with Him.
    <br>A person has the ability to preach, to teach; "In Jesus' name. Amen."
    <br>We have the ability to do it.
    <br>Will through the mind.
    <br>The Holy Spirit teaches, preaches, counsels, witnesses, testifies as He wills.
    <br>So, the song...
    <br>What a wonderful song.
    <br>Give it once again.
    <br>I bless the singer and I bless the composer.
    <br>Be All God Has Called You - T.B. JOSHUA SERMON
    <br>Who is like You Lord in all the earth
    <br>Matchless love and beauty endless love
    <br>Nothing in this world can satisfy
    <br>Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry
    <br>Your presence in Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence in Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence in Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence in Heaven to me
    <br>Oh Jesus oh Jesus
    <br>Your presence in Heaven to me
    <br>The presence of God comes by relationship with Him.
    <br>The beginning of our message...
    <br>The main thing about the Christianity
    <br>is not what we do.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "the main thing about Christianity is not what we do".
    <br>I don't know what you do, yousay you are a pastor, evangelist, Christian... just mention them.
    <br>It is not what we do, but the relationship we maintain.
    <br>Your presence is heaven to me
    <br>If the presence is Heaven to me, we are talking of an atmosphere.
    <br>It means the atmosphere produced by that relationship is Heaven to you.
    <br>You say, "Your presence is Heaven to me".
    <br>They talk of Heaven to you - the presence.
    <br>You are talking of an atmosphere.
    <br>Under what atmosphere?
    <br>That is, an atmosphere produced by that relationship is Heaven.
    <br>Go and work on your relationship.
    <br>And stop deceiving yourself by saying; "I am a pastor, I am this, I am that",
    <br>and wasting your time sleeping in the church.
    <br>It's a wasting of effort.
    <br>Let us work on our relationship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "work on your relationship,
    <br>and stop deceiving yourself saying;
    <br>'I am a Christian. I am a Pastor. I am a Prophet. I am a Bishop. I am an Evangelist.
    <br>I am a Counsellor. I am a Deacon. I am a Deaconess.'"
    <br>Go and work on your relationship.
    <br>Yes, because all these titles cannot take us to heaven.
    <br>"I am a Prophet."
    <br>On the last day the Lord will not say, "T.B. Joshua - prophet he is prophet - allow him to enter".
    <br>Which kind of Prophet?
    <br>It is relationship that will take you to Heaven.
    <br>Relationship with Him will take you to heaven.
    <br>All this; "I am a Pastor, Prophet, Deacon, Deaconess, Christian, this, that..."
    <br>are symbolic.
    <br>Jesus - the hope of Glory.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "work on your relationship"
    <br>Work on your relationship.
    <br>The atmosphere produced by that relationship will usher you to Jesus.
    <br>People hide under these names;
    <br>Christianity, hide under I am a prophet, hide under I am a bishop, I am deacon;  deaconess, I am this and that...
    <br>We keep hiding under that name, because this is what people want to hear.
    <br>People want to hear; "I am a Bishop. I am a Prophet. I am this, that.
    <br>I am a Christian. I am born-again."
    <br>They hide under these names.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>The main thing about Christianity
    <br>is not what we do
    <br>but the relationship we maintain.
    <br>The atmosphere produced by that relationship will usher you to Jesus.
    <br>We have to work... - this is fundamental.
    <br>Don't let anybody to give you any title or name - work.
    <br>Your work will give you that name.
    <br>Leave the title open.
    <br>God bless you
    <br>Hallelujah!
