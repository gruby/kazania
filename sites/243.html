    <br>The Bible says, "Behold I have given you authority"
    <br>and this authority given to you - you are here in His presence,
    <br>meaning whatever you loose, shall be loosed in Heaven.
    <br>And whatever satan might have bound in your life, right now, it is the time to loose it.
    <br>I want you to stretch your hand and begin to deliver whatever that is not of Jesus within you.
    <br>Begin to deliver whatever that is not of Jesus.

    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>Watch the screen of your television and see what is happening.
    <br>As you are commanding out everything that is not of Jesus Christ in the life of your neighbour,
    <br>watch the screen and see what is coming out of the life of this man.
    <br>You can see what he is vomiting out.
    <br>Everything that is not of God, the Spirit of God is uprooting it in the life of this man to set him free.
    <br>There is another woman on the screen and you can see what she is vomiting out.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>We are going somewhere and when we get there you will discover, the wealth in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Are you ready to go with me?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>I want you to hold your neighbour.
    <br>Your neighbour will be saying; whatever that is not of Jesus -
    <br>your neighbour wants to deliver it.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, he delivers you and you deliver him.
    <br>And if there is nothing in you or in him, then within your business,
    <br>whatever that has to do with you that is possessed - you want to deliver them.
    <br>Right now face your neighbour, hold your neighbour's hand
    <br>and begin to deliver your neighbour and your neighbour will begin to deliver you.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever that is not of Jesus - I command it out, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>Watch your screen and see the reaction of this man.
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Watch this man.
    <br>He has the spirit of pythons.
    <br>These are the different things that are tormenting people.
    <br>It is the spirit in him.
    <br>Trying to escape the fire of the Holy Spirit, the evil spirit makes the man to crawl towards the door.
    <br>Is he going out?
    <br>Open the door.
    <br>Let's see.
    <br>Let's see where he is going.
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>At the gate - there are angels of God there.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>You will see there is a force.
    <br>He wants to go out, while there is a force pushing him back.
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>Between outside and inside.
    <br>He is rolling back into the church, unable to move out.
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>The young man continues to manifest the contrary spirit in his life.
    <br>He makes a move to run and falls over.
    <br>As he tries to leave the church, he is bowed over backwards by an invisible force.
    <br>Crawling round he makes another attempt to run but he is blocked by the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Crawling again he moves over to the side, seizes a handbag and tries another approach,
    <br>covering his head with the bag but once again he is struck down.
    <br>- Who are you?
    <br>- I am a legion.
    <br>Get me out of here.
    <br>This power is too much.
    <br>What is your intention here today?
    <br>I will kill his father.
    <br>He has forced him to come here; I will kill that man.
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>We will listen to their confession later, we still have a long way.
    <br>We are doing deliverance now.
    <br>I want you to still face your neighbour.
    <br>Your confession is what God says about your situation.
    <br>Whatever you say now about your situation is what God says.
    <br>Your confession is your present attitude towards God.
    <br>The confession of your lips should have your heart's full agreement.
    <br>So, whatever you want to say now should agree with your lips.
    <br>And I want to tell you that what you will say any moment from now - it is not your word.
    <br>It is the word the Lord puts in your mouth.
    <br>Don't doubt it.
    <br>Right now, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Whatever you say here shall be said in Heaven.
    <br>Whatever you loose here shall be loosed in Heaven.
    <br>Right now open your lips and begin to deliver whatever that is not of Jesus
    <br>within and outside you and your neighbour; prayer!
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!

    <br>be it in your health, in your career, in your business, in your finances,
    <br>in your marital life - right now begin to rebuke it out!
    <br>Say, "Out!"

    <br>Anywhere you are, by faith; I'm laying my hand, the right hand of God upon you
    <br>and I deliver you from whatever that is not of God, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Whatever spirit that is not of Jesus...
    <br>Let the will of God be done in your life, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>These are the people we could not allow to enter the church because of the nature of their sickness.
    <br>They are here - look at them.
    <br>They are being delivered - those who ate poison...
    <br>During the mass prayer, people arranged for the prayer line begin to receive their healing.
    <br>Stretch your hand towards viewers at home.
    <br>Viewers, we want to say thank you for being part of out broadcasting today.

    <br>You are declared free, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>You are released, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Be it in your health, whatever spirit that kills, steals and destroys -
    <br>I deliver you, in the name of Jesus Christ.

    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Let us ask this guy.
    <br>You are the one that was causing trouble during the service - running up and down.
    <br>What's your problem?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>My name is Chigozie Igwe Mado, I am from Anambra State.
    <br>I actually came to the church today because my father has been
    <br>pressurising me to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>A lot has been happening to me of late.
    <br>My father is here in Nigeria.
    <br>For twenty-four years now, I have been having this spirit inside of me.
    <br>When I sleep, most times at night, I don't sleep straight, I cuddle up.
    <br>I see things in my dream like a legion.
    <br>I hear the word, "Legion."
    <br>- You mean, you don't sleep straight.
    <br>- I don't sleep straight.
    <br>Come and sleep here and let's see how you sleep.
    <br>Sleep the way you sleep.
    <br>Watch the screen; he is showing us the position he used to be in while sleeping.
    <br>Nearly everybody sleeps like this.
    <br>When you feel cold, you sleep like this, you fold yourself.
    <br>That's all?
    <br>It is a normal way of sleeping, people sleep like that.
    <br>Whenever I do it, I get in contact with them when I dream.
    <br>The snakes, six of them - the legion.
    <br>I get in contact with it.
    <br>These snakes inside of me have been making me do a lot of things -
    <br>evil things that words could not even tell.
    <br>I have been criticising the church, The SCOAN.
    <br>Even my landlady and my cousin are in support of it. We all say he's fake.
    <br>My father called and said, "You must go to that church and get delivered."
    <br>He has tried many things, he has even taken me to herbal homes.
    <br>When the man of God started praying today, I stood up and I wanted to leave the church;
    <br>I put my shoes on, I wanted to leave.
    <br>Immediately, as if he knew, the man of God said,
    <br>"Hold the partner beside you, hold their hands and start praying" and I was struggling to leave!
    <br>Right now face your neighbour, hold your neighbour's hand.
    <br>Right now open your lips and begin to deliver whatever that is not of Jesus within and outside you
    <br>and your neighbour; prayer!
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>As I was struggling to leave, the guy beside me said,
    <br>"Didn't you hear? The man of God said we should hold hands and pray".
    <br>I said, "Please, I'm late! I'm running, I'm going somewhere!"
    <br>But he held my hands and we started praying.
    <br>Inside me, I just wanted the prayer to be over so that I could just dash out
    <br>and prove to my father that Prophet T.B. Joshua cannot change the way I am.
    <br>All of a sudden, I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua wearing a white garment
    <br>in front of where I was sitting there and he said, "You spirit, out!"
    <br>The next thing I saw was me under a chair and then I started looking for a way out.
    <br>I was crawling, I could not hear the voices, I could not hear what I was saying.
    <br>I was trying to leave.
    <br>Then I saw some men standing wearing white just at that extreme door there.
    <br>It is the spirit in him.
    <br>Trying to escape the fire of the Holy Spirit, the evil spirit makes the man to crawl towards the door.
    <br>Is he going out?
    <br>Open the door.
    <br>Let's see.
    <br>Let's see where he is going.
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>At the gate - there are angels of God there.
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>You will see there is a force.
    <br>He wants to go out, while there is a force pushing him back.

    <br>He is rolling back into the church, unable to move out.

    <br>This power is too much.
    <br>What is your intention here today?
    <br>I will kill his father.
    <br>He has forced him to come here; I will kill that man.
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>They were holding torches, fire burning on a stick like that of the Olympic games.
    <br>And they were saying , "Go back, go back!"
    <br>Those are the words I could hear.
    <br>Angels with fire and all that.
    <br>Right now I believe - it's no longer fake!
    <br>When you were running out and coming back, what happened? Tell us.
    <br>As I was going I saw men wearing white, light in complexion, carrying torches.
    <br>It's not fake, it's true.
    <br>I need deliverance, please.
    <br>It's been 24 years now, my parents are tired of me, I want to be healed.
    <br>I'm a young man, I need help.
    <br>Please pastor, deliver me.
    <br>With a word, Prophet T.B. Joshua delivers the young man in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and give thanks to God.
    <br>The day you know T.B. Joshua is the day you will destroy T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What you don't understand you call names, what you understand you destroy.
    <br>A DEMON sees ANGELS in CHURCH!!!
    <br>It takes the grace of holiness to do this; and that grace comes from God.
    <br>Holy, holy, holy to deal with darkness - it takes the grace of holiness.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Chigozie Igwe Mado, I'm from Anambra State.
    <br>I have been having this problem in my life.
    <br>I've been having these problems at night when I sleep.
    <br>When I sleep, I cuddle and when I cuddle, it makes me see things I don't want to see -
    <br>like snakes which called themselves legion.
    <br>They are about six.
    <br>This makes me to hate sleeping at night.
    <br>These evil spirits that possessed your life;
    <br>explain what were the negative effects they had.
    <br>I did a lot of things that are not to glorify God.
    <br>I travelled out - setback again; I've done a lot, yet not moving.
    <br>It caused a lot of negative things in my life.
    <br>Just explain; when you were going through this time
    <br>and you were possessed with these evil spirits,
    <br>where had you gone to try and find a way out and get solution?
    <br>I have gone to a lot of places.
    <br>My father, my mother, we've gone to different churches, traditional homes but eventually all to no avail.
    <br>I am still the way I am.
    <br>What then led you to be here today at The SCOAN?
    <br>I would say I was just too proud.
    <br>I was trying to let my father know that The Synagogue could do nothing to change my life.
    <br>He was worried, "You have to go to that man of God.
    <br>If you don't go to him, to Synagogue; if you don't go there, I'm not going to see you as my son again."
    <br>So I had to come here to prove to him that there is nothing he can do
    <br>because I myself, my friends, my landlady,
    <br>we all say the church is no good and I'm not sure they do real things,
    <br>that they heal with the power of God.
    <br>But today it is a different encounter entirely.
    <br>Just explain what then happened when you later saw the man of God.
    <br>Wow! It was wonderful.
    <br>When I saw him coming, I was so scared.
    <br>Even when he was not close to me, a lot happened.
    <br>How much more when I stood in front of him?
    <br>It baffled me when he said, "Come closer."
    <br>I was scared but I know I was prepared for deliverance.
    <br>When he asked me what I wanted, I said, "Man of God, please deliver me"
    <br>and he said that I should receive the Spirit of God and I did.
    <br>When I did, I felt so light and I found myself on the ground.
    <br>It was a great experience because the burden was gone, it was no more.
    <br>Praise God for this wonderful deliverance.
    <br>Indeed, after the prayer of the man of God, those evil spirits within you came out,
    <br>left and you are totally free now. Is that right?
    <br>So free.
    <br>For those viewers out there, God is here and that's the truth.
    <br>Amen. As we all know, there are many living churches
    <br>and we thank God that God has revealed this particular ministry to you.
    <br>And we just want to encourage you to continue to follow our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>now that you have received your deliverance today in His holy name.
    <br>Better is not good enough, the best is yet to come,
    <br>as you continue to make God's Word the standard for your life and follow His ways.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
