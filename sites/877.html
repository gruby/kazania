  <p>    
    <br>Sitting in a car  waiting to be attended to
    <br>is a man who was brought to The SCOAN in a debilitating condition.
    <br>He sits almost motionless
    <br>and is seen wearing a neck collar and a contraption around his body is a lumbar corset,
    <br>which he is wearing as another form of support.
    <br>These support devices give us some clue to his medical condition,
    <br>which is the reason why he has come to The SCOAN.
    <br>Taking a look at the placard he is holding, which outlines the problem he is having,
    <br>we can see that he is suffering from paralysis of the whole body
    <br>due to hernia of the spine.
    <br>As the camera zooms in, we can take a look at the medical report
    <br>that he has brought with him, which shows the exact problem he is having.
    <br>This is the medical report he has brought with him from his country.
    <br>Note that it is not written in English.
    <br>The medical report states that he is having a hernia in the spine
    <br>and states the exact area in his back which has been affected, causing the paralysis.
    <br>This is a scan that he has also brought along with him,
    <br>which further shows the medical problem he is having.
    <br>After trying to find a solution to his problem - all to no avail -
    <br>he has come to The SCOAN, desperate to see an end to his nine-year bondage.
    <br>Let us hear from him.
    <br>Brother, you are welcome to The SCOAN.
    <br>Please tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>My name is Mohammed Ali Jichy.
    <br>I am from Lebanon.
    <br>I am 30 years old.
    <br>You are welcome, sir. Can you tell us the problems that have brought you here to The SCOAN today.
    <br>I have paralysis of the whole body due to hernia of the spine.
    <br>I also have an enlarged liver and an enlarged spleen.
    <br>For how many years have you suffered from these problems?
    <br>It started in 2008 - now going to nine years.
    <br>Ok. Sir, can you tell us how these problems began in your life. How did it start nine years ago?
    <br>I was just moving and I felt a pain in my legs and in my back.
    <br>After that, I went to do some tests. I went to many hospitals.
    <br>It just began with a severe pain, and this pain just became worse and worse as it went on?
    <br>It is so bad that I can't sleep at night.
    <br>I can't lie on my back. I can't relax my head on the floor.
    <br>I can't sleep well. I can't walk. It has given me many problems in my life.
    <br>My body  paralysed.
    <br>I can't move my neck. I can't turn left or right. I can't lift my head up or down.
    <br>Even my back - I can't bend.
    <br>My waist - I can't bend down to pick something from the floor; I can't do anything.
    <br>I can't really feel my body.
    <br>What did the doctor say about this problem?
    <br>Some of them say that the cause is from a disc in my lower back.
    <br>Some of them say that I need an operation.
    <br>I went to many doctors.
    <br>Where have you travelled to because of this problem  trying to  find a solution?
    <br>I went to Lebanon - my country. I went to the biggest hospitals.
    <br>Even in Nigeria, where I went, I saw many doctors but I was not able to get a solution.
    <br>So medically, they couldn't find any solution to this problem?
    <br>They just advised you to go for an operation?
    <br>Yes, that is it.
    <br>They are just giving me painkillers.
    <br>You are taking painkillers?
    <br>I am living with painkillers; that is how I am living.
    <br>Every day, I must take a tablet.
    <br>So, even for you to come here today, you had to take painkiller tablets?
    <br>Every morning, I do that.
    <br>How did you find out about this church?
    <br>My friend, Mr Gabriel, was concerned about me.
    <br>I complained to him every time that I am having pain - my body is paining me.
    <br>I went to many hospitals and had tests done but there was no result.
    <br>My friend told me that there was a channel called Emmanuel TV, that I should be watching it.
    <br>Then, I started watching it, day by day for the last two months, up to now.
    <br>Then, we decided to come here today for me to receive my healing.
    <br>I am a muslim. My name is Mohammed.
    <br>You decided to come to The SCOAN, believing God for your healing?
    <br>Sure, I believe in God for healing.
    <br>And now that you are here, sir, at The SCOAN
    <br>what do you believe that God Almighty would do for you through Prophet T.B. Joshua?
    <br>I believe that God will heal me.
    <br>Amen. We believe with you too that indeed, you will be healed.
    <br>Sir, we can see that as you are here, you are using some devices
    <br>which are obviously were uncomfortable.
    <br>Can you describe to us what it is that you are using now.
    <br>It is a neck support, so I would not feel the pain.
    <br>It is not a cure; it is just a support.
    <br>Even this (lumbar corset) is because in my lower back, there is a serious pain.
    <br>It can just assist to reduce the pain a little.
    <br>I am suffering from much pain; I can't sleep.
    <br>We know that you came here with some people.
    <br>Who are the people that accompanied you here today?
    <br>Mr Gabriel and Mrs Blessing.
    <br>Mr Gabriel is working in our company.
    <br>I am his boss but he is also my friend.
    <br>Mr Mohammed Ali Jichy's situation is so severe that he is basically immobile,
    <br>unable to move his body freely,
    <br>unable to do normal daily activities,
    <br>and unable to get a good night's sleep,
    <br>owing to the accompanying pain and discomfort he is in.
    <br>Imprisoned by his condition of paralysis of the whole body,
    <br>among other conditions, The SCOAN is his last bus stop.
    <br>This is the medication that has been prescribed to him by his doctor for short-term relief
    <br>to help him cope with the severe pain and discomfort he experiences on a daily basis.
    <br>There are different kinds of medications.
    <br>This is the injection.
    <br>Can you explain to us how you would use this, sir.
    <br>I have to take it daily. This is the one I inject.
    <br>Why would you have to inject this into your muscle, sir?
    <br>It can make me feel better - to reduce the pain just for some time.
    <br>It is not a cure.
    <br>Even upon all of this medication you are taking, the problem still continued?
    <br>It still continues. I can't move.
    <br>I can't move because of the pain.
    <br>Once again, sir, now that you are here, what do you believe God will do for you?
    <br>I will be healed, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Gabriel.
    <br>The person next to me is my lovely wife and the other person is my younger brother.
    <br>He is my boss in the office. Every day, he complains about his pain
    <br>and based on this, he has travelled out of the country.
    <br>He went to Lebanon and he told me that he went to the biggest hospital in Lebanon.
    <br>He did so many tests and when he came back, he showed me all the tests he had done.
    <br>He even has a CD based on his ailment. When I saw all this, I said to him,
    <br>"There is a place you need to go to that is called The SCOAN".
    <br>He told me that his name was Mohammed and that based on his religion,
    <br>he had not visited any church before.
    <br>I told him that the man of God does not care where you come from or what your religion is,
    <br>that he takes care of everybody.
    <br>So, each day, based on this, he decided to have Emmanuel TV on his mobile phone.
    <br>Every day, he would watch it.
    <br>In the morning, he would come and the first thing I would do was to ask him,
    <br>how he was feeling.
    <br>He would reply that he could not sleep and that if not for the pain-relieving medication he took,
    <br>he would not have been able to come to work.
    <br>I told him that we should please try the hand of God.
    <br>On Friday, he told me, "Gabriel, I have made up my mind. I will go with you to that living church".
    <br>So, that was why we came here today.
    <br>And now that you have brought him here, sir, what do you believe that Jesus Christ is going to do for him?
    <br>I believe totally that he will be healed today and that he is going to testify to the glory of God.
    <br>Amen. We believe with you too that Jesus Christ will indeed heal our brother
    <br>and set him free completely from this paralysis of the whole body
    <br>due to the hernia and spine, alongside the enlarged liver and spleen.
    <br>We believe that our brother here, alongside this family, will be coming back with wonderful testimonies,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>During a Sunday service, as Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer to the congregation,
    <br>he is led by the Spirit of God to respond to a cry coming from outside.
    <br>Man of God, help my boss! He cannot walk; he has pain!
    <br>He has paralysis of the whole body.
    <br>Man of God, please help! I have had paralysis for nine years!
    <br>I have back pain and leg pain, all over my body. I can't walk; I can't sleep well.
    <br>You recognise Jesus as Healer, Saviour and Deliverer?
    <br>He proceeds to pray for him.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come on! Leave the place!
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>As the lightning power of God moves through Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>something extraordinary takes place.
    <br>Stand up and walk!
    <br>Don't help him; he will stand up by himself.
    <br>Go!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Honour be to Jesus! Honour be to Him!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>He's my husband's boss.
    <br>He could not walk. He could not do anything.
    <br>Even in his office, he was paralysed and always on drugs - every minute, every second.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I can move my head!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body
    <br>What an incredible transformation in the life of our brother!
    <br>Let's put our hands together one more time for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Right now, we want to use the opportunity to listen to him.
    <br>We believe his testimony will greatly bless the people of God present here and our viewers all over the world.
    <br>So, brother, you are very welcome.
    <br>Please introduce yourself to us - tell us your name, where you're from and the people beside you.
    <br>My name is Mohammed Ali Jichy.
    <br>I am from Lebanon. My age is 30 years. I'm a Muslim.
    <br>This is Mr Gabriel and this is his wife - Mrs Blessing.
    <br>Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was having paralysis of the whole body.
    <br>I couldn't sleep well; I couldn't walk.
    <br>I couldn't bend over to pick up something on the floor.
    <br>I was paralysed.
    <br>I went to many doctors. It was in 2008 that I started having the problem.
    <br>I went to many doctors and hospitals outside the country as well as here in Nigeria
    <br>but there was no solution.
    <br>They were just giving me pain killers, injections in my muscles and injections in my spine.
    <br>It was just pain killers.
    <br>It was then they gave me a neck collar and body brace.
    <br>All of that was not a cure; it was just so I could manage.
    <br>I was complaining all the time to Mr Gabriel that I had body pain.
    <br>I had serious body pain; I could not sleep well.
    <br>I couldn't walk well; I couldn't do anything.
    <br>He said that I should watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I began watching; I watched Emmanuel TV for two months.
    <br>It touched me and I said I wanted to come to the church
    <br>but I wasn't sure if they would attend to me because I'm a Muslim.
    <br>But God did it for me; I am healed now.
    <br>Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body
    <br>Wow! Glory be to God Almighty!
    <br>Sir, before you explain what happened when you came here,
    <br>what did you see on Emmanuel TV that really encouraged you to come?
    <br>I saw a lady who had cancer and all her hair had fallen out
    <br>and she had body pain and all the rest.
    <br>She came back after four years to give her testimony; she was healed!
    <br>Thank God!
    <br>So when you saw this testimony of someone with cancer that received her healing,
    <br>that inspired you to also come to The SCOAN?
    <br>It encouraged me to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>So when you told your colleague in the office - the person working with you - Mr Gabriel,
    <br>what did you tell him when you said you wanted to come to the church?
    <br>I said that I wanted to go to The SCOAN
    <br>but I didn't know if they would attend to me because I was not a Christian.
    <br>But he told me that the church would attend to me
    <br>and that the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, does not discriminate between Muslim and Christian
    <br>or whoever you are, so, I came.
    <br>We thank God that you came, sir, realising that this is an arena of liberty
    <br>where the love of God is obviously the most important thing.
    <br>When you came, sir, we saw on the screen just earlier
    <br>when Prophet T.B. Joshua began to pray for you,
    <br>tell us - what happened to you when he prayed for you?
    <br>I can't explain that, really.
    <br>Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body
    <br>It was a wonderful feeling. I can't explain it; I don't know how.
    <br>It was the Spirit of God; that is all I can say.
    <br>Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body
    <br>Sir, we just saw that your body was actually shaking; you fell down.
    <br>Do you remember at all what was happening to you at that moment?
    <br>I can't remember anything.
    <br>I just felt my body vibrating.
    <br>Then, I don't know.
    <br>Wow, that is the power of God Almighty through Prophet T.B. Joshua that touched our brother!
    <br>Ever since then, sir, what are the changes you have seen in your life?
    <br>I haven't taken a single drug since Sunday.
    <br>From the time the man of God prayed and God healed me, I have not taken drugs or injections
    <br>or used the neck collar or body brace.
    <br>Wow! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You mean to say, sir, that you have returned to work,
    <br>you're back to your work, you're walking normally, everything about you is back to normal?
    <br>It's back to normal; glory to God! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body
    <br>Hallelujah! We thank God Almighty for what He has done in our brother's life!
    <br>Sir, apart from the physical healing you received, what other changes have you witnessed in your life?
    <br>I am close to Jesus, more and more.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body
    <br>After my healing, I am closer to Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Wow! We thank God Almighty for what he has done in our brother's life.
    <br>Can you just explain to us, sir - you mentioned in the interview earlier
    <br>that because the pain was so severe,
    <br>it really even affected your relationship with others;
    <br>it caused you to get very angry easily because of the severity of the pain.
    <br>Just tell us - what are the changes that you have seen in that area?
    <br>There is no more hot temper; I am friends with everybody.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Wow! Thank God Almighty!
    <br>Not only did our brother receive physical healing;
    <br>he was also set free from that spirit that pushed him to get very angry
    <br>and we give glory to God.
    <br>Now, for the glory of God, sir, we would like to see you demonstrate
    <br>what you can now do that you couldn't do before.
    <br>Mohammed Ali Jichy - Healed of Paralysis Of The Whole Body
    <br>Wow! This is something that was impossible for our brother to do before!
    <br>But you can see him today - a living testimony to the glory of God.
    <br>We thank God for what He has done in your life, sir.
    <br>We just want to hear a word from our brother that really encouraged you to be here
    <br>and introduced you to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr Gabriel.
    <br>The man next to me is my boss and my friend and the lady is my wife.
    <br>Last Sunday, we came here with my friend, and he was really feeling bad.
    <br>The pain was too much so we had to cry to the man of God.
    <br>To the glory of God, what we came for was fulfilled.
    <br>I give God the glory.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God Almighty!
    <br>Sir, as someone that worked very closely with Mr Mohammed,
    <br>can you just tell us a little bit about before - how this problem really affected him
    <br>and then the changes you have seen in his life after the prayer.
    <br>Before, he was always very aggressive.
    <br>Most of the time, people pass through me to him
    <br>because they see me as a more or less ADC to him.
    <br>When that pain was on - except me that understands him very well...
    <br>He is not a bad man or wicked person.
    <br>To the glory of God, after we left this place, on Monday, a boy that was punished,
    <br>when he came to work, he now asked him to call him.
    <br>When I heard that, I was so excited.
    <br>One thing I learnt here, there is a lot of love.
    <br>Even the workers - from the workers to the man of God - they are lovely.
    <br>I believe that anybody who enters here and doesn't have that change of being loved -
    <br>I think he has to go somewhere else.
    <br>When we went to work on Monday, there was a boy that he punished.
    <br>Just for a trial, the boy decided to come.
    <br>So when he came, he said, "Go back to your work!"
    <br>There are other things that normally happened to him.
    <br>He always told me that he never dreamt.
    <br>But on that day, after we left this place on Sunday,
    <br>when I came to work on Monday, he was laughing and told me,
    <br>"Mr Gabriel, do you know what?"
    <br>I said, "What is it?"
    <br>He said, "I dreamt last night and I was telling God 'Thank You, Jesus!'".
    <br>Even when he woke up, he was still saying it, "Thank You, Jesus!".
    <br>Hallelujah! One more time, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Now we thank God for this wonderful testimony we have just listened to from our brother here.
    <br>Once again, when we listen to testimonies, it is important that we learn valuable lessons
    <br>from the contents of those testimonies.
    <br>We learnt from our brother here that one of the things that really impacted our brother
    <br>from coming to The SCOAN was seeing the fruit of the Spirit in action -
    <br>the love of God in action.
    <br>As we remember recently when Prophet T.B. Joshua actually visited the nation of Israel,
    <br>we saw in the clips how he held a meeting with religious leaders of different faiths -
    <br>religious leaders from Judaism, Islam, Christianity.
    <br>During that meeting, Prophet T.B. Joshua said, "The love of God transcends all religion,
    <br>any geographical barrier or any ethnic barrier".
    <br>We believe it was the love of God that our brother received when he came to The SCOAN
    <br>and we can see the fruit in his life thereafter.
    <br>How upon going back to work on Monday, many of the people that he had sacked previously
    <br>he called them back and allowed them to come back to work
    <br>because of that same love of God Almighty.
    <br>So, once again, this is a lesson for all of us.
    <br>As we have heard Prophet T.B. Joshua preaching regularly -
    <br>even last Sunday, he said, "When you hold an offence against a brother,
    <br>you have already grieved the Holy Spirit".
    <br>After not only receiving physical healing but spiritual healing,
    <br>our brother here - Mr Mohammed - actually wanted to make sure he let go of all offence,
    <br>let go of all bitterness or pain of the past
    <br>and actually forgive and reconcile with the people that he had sent out from his office
    <br>as the brother, Mr Gabriel, just explained.
    <br>So this is God. This is the name of Jesus Christ that we are talking about.
    <br>It is not only in physically calling the name.
    <br>Today, some people would be calling the name in a way to try and cause division,
    <br>or try and spread problems between people of different religions.
    <br>But the name of Jesus Christ must bring results,
    <br>must be followed by the corresponding power.
    <br>We have seen in the life of our brother now that he did not only receive physical healing
    <br>spiritual healing but you have seen how his life has also changed thereafter
    <br>and the fruits of the Spirit have started to show in his life.
    <br>So one more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We would just like to ask our brother a final question.
    <br>What is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>My advice to anyone who has a problem, like my problem or not like my problem,
    <br>any problem you have,
    <br>all healing, all blessing - receive your healing, in Jesus' name!
