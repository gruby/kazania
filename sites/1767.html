    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>There is a stick - a very small stick.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You normally take it along.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>It is possessed.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Sometimes you see yourself among the dead.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>That is the spirit of death.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Prophecy And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God, my name is Mfan Fikile.
    <br>I am here to confirm and to confess
    <br>the word of prophecy that was given to me
    <br>by the highly favoured man of God, Prophet TB Joshua, last Sunday.
    <br>The man of God gave me two prophecies.
    <br>The first prophecy he said that there is a stick that I carry which is possessed,
    <br>of which I confirm that prophecy to be true.
    <br>And he also said that I see dead bodies in my dreams,
    <br>of which I also confirm that prophecy to be true.
    <br>I come from a family of sangomas
    <br>[witchdoctors].
    <br>My grandmother was a sangoma;
    <br>my mother was also a sangoma.
    <br>Growing up in that setup, we were involved in many things that sangomas do,
    <br>including the initiation of other sangomas.
    <br>And when there were ceremonies for appeasing the ancestors, we also took part in those ceremonies.
    <br>I also have a number of incisions on my body for protection which was done by my parents.
    <br>This thing really affected me because while growing up I was a wayward child.
    <br>As I was growing up, at the age of 15 I started taking drugs,
    <br>I started smoking marijuana,
    <br>I started smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol,
    <br>and later on I even started taking cocaine.
    <br>This affected me a lot because whenever I was high on drugs and drunk from alcohol,
    <br>whenever I came to social places like bars,
    <br>people took their belongings and ran away because they knew that trouble was coming -
    <br>I was a person with a lot of anger and I would cause trouble.
    <br>I would fight people. No matter the number of people, I would fight whether I got hurt or not.
    <br>I just did not care.
    <br>And I was not even scared of the Police - I fought them when they came for me.
    <br>So, it really affected my life a lot.
    <br>The addiction was too much,
    <br>because as I said, I started taking drugs at 15 years of age,
    <br>so I was an addict for 25 years - now I am 40 years old.
    <br>I would smoke about ten 'joints' [of marijuana] a day, every day.
    <br>It affected me because whenever I was high I became angry and nobody wanted to be next to me.
    <br>As time went by I started farming with marijuana with my friends and some of my brothers,
    <br>and we also smuggled it into other countries where we had secured a market.
    <br>But yet all the problems which we tried to solve with this illegal business did not work,
    <br>because I used the money that I received from the sale of the drugs recklessly
    <br>and I did not know what I had done with that money.
    <br>This is when the problems escalated even to my family -
    <br>we were always fighting - there were problems, broken relationships in the family,
    <br>financial problems even though we were working.
    <br>We decided to approach a sangoma to cleanse our home from all these things.
    <br>The sangoma came to our home and did the ritual to cleanse the home,
    <br>and he invited me to his place to further complete the process.
    <br>When I got there I told him that I was smuggling drugs outside the country.
    <br>He told me that he could give me a solution
    <br>to prevent the Police from finding the dagga [marijuana] while I transported it,
    <br>so that when I reached the buyers they would pay handsomely for our consignment.
    <br>That is when he gave me the stick and said that I had to put it in the bag while the marijuana was being transported -
    <br>the stick would protect us from the Police and ensure that the buyers would pay handsomely.
    <br>I was shocked when the man of God prophesied about the stick
    <br>because nobody knew about it - even in my family, except for my younger brother.
    <br>So, it was shocking.
    <br>YOU SEE YOURSELF AMONG THE DEAD!!!  TB Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>We continued to smuggle the marijuana, but the problems never ceased - instead they became worse.
    <br>A friend of mine at work introduced me to Emmanuel TV.
    <br>When I was watching Emmanuel TV I was shocked to see someone with such an anointing
    <br>who could deliver people from the same problems that I was facing,
    <br>and the same problems that we were facing as a family.
    <br>That was when I decided to come to The SCOAN for deliverance.
    <br>You will be surprised to hear that the day before I came to The SCOAN,
    <br>I took marijuana and even thought about bringing some with me.
    <br>That was how I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>During the Sunday service, when the man of God touched me
    <br>I don't know what happened; I just found myself on the floor.
    <br>And when I got up I felt a calmness I cannot explain and there was so much peace
    <br>that I knew that my family and I were delivered, and the devil had been shamed.
    <br>Amen. Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Brother, ever since that touch from Jesus last week, tell us the changes you have seen in your life.
    <br>There is a lot that has changed.
    <br>For example, the man of God prophesied that in my dreams I see dead bodies.
    <br>Even the day before the Sunday service last week,
    <br>I saw myself with a dead body in my dream, which I was trying to bury on my own.
    <br>But since the deliverance I have been sleeping peacefully - no bad dreams -
    <br>and I have not had any craving for the drugs.
    <br>YOU SEE YOURSELF AMONG THE DEAD!!!  TB Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>I will take my words of advice from the Scriptures.
    <br>One is from Matthew 11:28 which says, "Come to Me all ye who are heavily burdened and I will give you rest".
    <br>And I will quote the second one from the book of
    <br>Hebrews 4:16 which says, "Come boldly to the throne of grace for you will receive mercy and grace in time of need".
    <br>YOU SEE YOURSELF AMONG THE DEAD!!!  TB Joshua Personal Prophecy
    <br>My advice to people who are facing the same problem which I was facing
    <br>is that do as I have done - come to the throne of grace and
    <br>you will receive mercy and grace whenever you are in need.
    <br>And make God the standard for your life.
    <br>Amen. Let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
