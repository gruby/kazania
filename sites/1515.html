  <p>    
    <br>Turn to your neighbour and greet them, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give your other neighbour a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Greet the neighbour behind you - a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Give a neighbour in front of you a handshake, say, "Emmanuel".
    <br>And greet the viewers all over the world on Emmanuel TV, "Emmanuel".
    <br>Indeed, God is with us.
    <br>You may have your seats in the presence of God and say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Once again, you are all welcome here today to The SCOAN - the arena of liberty, in Jesus' name.
    <br>To begin today's message, I have a very quick question;
    <br>I want to hear from those who are present here today.
    <br>How many of you here travelled from another country to be here, in the service today?
    <br>If you came from another country, raise up your hand.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>You are very welcome.
    <br>How many people travelled by plane, took a flight to be here today - raise up your hand.
    <br>Wow, you are very welcome.
    <br>On these flights, how many of us had to stop over in another country
    <br>before continuing on to Nigeria - raise up your hands.
    <br>How many of you stopped in more than one country;
    <br>how many stopped in two countries?
    <br>OK, there are some people.
    <br>How many stopped in three countries?
    <br>Some people stopped in three countries?
    <br>I need to hear from this person.
    <br>The person that stopped in three countries - can you come forward?
    <br>You stopped in three different countries in your journey to Nigeria?
    <br>OK, madam, thank you very much.
    <br>Let's here from our sister here.
    <br>Your name, ma?
    <br>My name is Mrs Aina.
    <br>I come from Burkina Faso, I took the road, went to Togo, Benin, and came to Nigeria.
    <br>Wow, let's put our hands together for her.
    <br>Our sister came by road, all the way from her country through three different countries.
    <br>Is there anyone who came by flight that stopped over in three or two countries?
    <br>Anyone?
    <br>Let's hear from our brother here.
    <br>It is good to know where we are from.
    <br>OK, sir; tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>My name is Mr Kamara. I am from Sierra Leone.
    <br>I flew from Sierra Leone to Accra, Ghana, then to Togo, Lome, and from Lome to Lagos.
    <br>OK, interesting journey; let's put our hands together for him.
    <br>Do you know the reason why I'm asking this question?
    <br>I want to use the brother and sister that just spoke -
    <br>their journey as an illustration for all of us present here today.
    <br>For everyone that is here today -
    <br>we are all on a journey.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I am on a journey".
    <br>Life itself is a journey.
    <br>Everyone here today - take note of this - has been given a good destiny.
    <br>Everyone!
    <br>Also, everyone on this journey, to their good destiny,
    <br>must have some transit points where they get connected to their future.
    <br>I hope you follow me.
    <br>Just like our brother there had to go from his country; he had stopovers in Ghana, Togo,
    <br>from there to Nigeria.
    <br>That were the stopovers, the transit points in his journey.
    <br>I have a very simple but valuable truth to tell everyone today.
    <br>As a Christian, the challenges you are facing are simply a transit point
    <br>to connect you to your destiny.
    <br>DON'T GET STUCK IN A STOP-OVER!!! ✈️ | Chris Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>Yes!
    <br>What you are facing as a Christian - your challenges, your situation -
    <br>is simply a transit point, stepping stone, connection to take you to your destination.
    <br>What you are passing through is part of the events arranged and designed by God
    <br>to usher you into your destiny.
    <br>If you know this truth,
    <br>if you understand this principle, you will not get carried away by your challenges -
    <br>you will not get so caught up in your challenges,
    <br>you will not allow your situation, challenges, troubles to mislead you or deceive you.
    <br>This will lead us to the title of today's message:
    <br>DON'T GET STUCK IN A STOPOVER
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, don't get stuck in a stopover".
    <br>When God is executing His plans in our lives,
    <br>He also designs and arranges the events that continue to unfold
    <br>until His purpose is revealed.
    <br>A brilliant and wonderful illustration of this from the Bible is the case of Joseph.
    <br>I'm very sure you are familiar with the story of Joseph
    <br>but I encourage you, in your spare time to read it once again in the Book of Genesis 37,
    <br>and then from 39 to 45 the full story, but I'm just going to take a few points.
    <br>Turn with me to Genesis 37;
    <br>I'm going to read verse 9.
    <br>Talking about Joseph - it says:
    <br>"Then he dreamed still another dream and told it to his brothers, and said,
    <br>'Look, I have dreamed another dream.
    <br>And this time, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars bowed down to me.'
    <br>So he told it to his father and his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him,
    <br>'What is this dream that you have dreamed?
    <br>Shall your mother and I and your brothers indeed come to bow to the earth before you?'
    <br>And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the matter in mind."
    <br>Joseph, at that tender age of 17, had a dream where he saw his siblings and parents bow down to him.
    <br>Very simply this meant that
    <br>by divine design, he was destined to become a leader.
    <br>I want to re-emphasise to everyone here today:
    <br>by divine design, you have a good destiny.
    <br>God never created anyone to be a failure.
    <br>I don't care what lies satan may have whispered in your ear,
    <br>what society may have told you; that you are not good enough, you are not smart enough,
    <br>you are not beautiful enough - no!
    <br>You have been given a good destiny by divine design.
    <br>That incredible photograph of tomorrow has been planted within you by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In fact, you are a work of art.
    <br>But to become God's person, you must follow His process just like Joseph did.
    <br>The time Joseph saw this dream, this vision of his future,
    <br>he was too young to appreciate the glory that lay ahead of him
    <br>and he was too inexperienced to handle the position that God prepared for him.
    <br>So, on his journey to the throne God prepared three stopovers, transit points.
    <br>Number one:
    <br>The dry pit where he was cruelly thrown into by his envious brothers.
    <br>Number two:
    <br>Potiphar's house where he was wrongly sold into slavery.
    <br>Number three:
    <br>The prison where he was sent after being falsely accused by Potiphar's wife.
    <br>To the carnally-minded person all of these stopovers looked like foolish things,
    <br>but these were God's way of preserving Joseph for the glory ahead
    <br>and preparing Joseph for the assignment ahead.
    <br>I repeat once again, people of God.
    <br>As a Christian, the challenges you are facing today
    <br>are simply a transit point to connect you to your destiny.
    <br>DON'T GET STUCK IN A STOPOVER
    <br>What's the first lesson we are going to take from the life of Joseph today?
    <br>If you consider what happened to Joseph, you will see that
    <br>the situation he encountered was in direct conflict with his dream, destiny.
    <br>In fact, we can clearly say through the case of Joseph that
    <br>God's providence often seems to contradict His purpose.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>His divine wisdom often seems to contradict the course of natural events.
    <br>What Joseph faced was the opposite to what his dream suggested.
    <br>He was destined to be the head, at the top but he found himself at the bottom of the dry pit.
    <br>He was destined to be a leader but he found himself in slavery and servitude.
    <br>He was destined to become a source of freedom for his people
    <br>but he found himself in the prison cell.
    <br>Perhaps, you can relate.
    <br>Perhaps, you too can identify.
    <br>Many of us here today, the situation we are facing
    <br>seems to contradict the promise of God for our lives.
    <br>What we are facing does not agree, does not seem to guarantee
    <br>the fulfillment of God's promise and purpose in our lives.
    <br>I have heard so many people come and say, "I don't understand.
    <br>Why am I sick, when God has promised me good health?
    <br>Why am I in debts, when God has promised me abundance?
    <br>Why am I barren, when God has promised me fruitfulness? Why?"
    <br>I remember a young brother came to meet me in the church one day after service.
    <br>He said, "Brother, I want to ask you a question.
    <br>I recently became a Christian and one thing I don't understand is
    <br>by watching Emmanuel TV, I see people giving testimonies of breakthrough, blessing,
    <br>but me, after I became a Christian, my challenges became worse.
    <br>Since I became a Christian, it is like the attacks increased. What's going on?"
    <br>He was confused.
    <br>Little did he know that
    <br>the tougher the challenges, the greater the glory.
    <br>He was only being prepared for greatness.
    <br>Challenges are part and parcel of greatness.
    <br>But in such circumstances, in such situations it is so easy for us
    <br>to begin to look at God in a bad light, "Why  is this happening to me?",
    <br>to begin to compare ourselves with others,
    <br>to begin to fight human enemies and to begin to create imaginary enemies that don't even exist,
    <br>to try and point a finger towards someone because of the situation we are facing,
    <br>it is so easy for us to lose focus and abandon our post,
    <br>and by so doing many people today get stuck in a stopover.
    <br>Look at Joseph!
    <br>It would have been easy for Joseph to say, "Where is God?
    <br>God revealed to me my destiny, and here I am at the bottom of this dry pit."
    <br>Instead of asking, "Where is God?",
    <br>Joseph simply asked this question, "Where is my dream?"
    <br>In other words: I don't belong here, I know where I belong, I know where I'm going,
    <br>my destiny does not agree with this, my dream does not suggest this,
    <br>this is just the stopover in my journey, this is just a stage in my journey,
    <br>this is not to impair me - this is to improve me.
    <br>I refuse to be stressed by my struggles.
    <br>I refuse to be controlled by my circumstances.
    <br>I know that God is preparing me for greatness.
    <br>DON'T GET STUCK IN A STOP-OVER!!! ✈️ | Chris Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>In the face of your storm today, how many of us have said this?
    <br>How many of you have talked to yourself saying, "No, look.
    <br>This is not where I belong. I know where I am going; I know where I belong.
    <br>This is not where I belong. I am not going to give in to the trap of the devil.
    <br>I am not going to give in and start grumbling, complaining, lamenting. No!
    <br>I know that God who took me to this trial, will see me through this trial."
    <br>It would have been very easy - if you put yourself in the position of Joseph -
    <br>for him to begin to nurse self-pity, "Why me? What is happening? God, are You really there?"
    <br>It would have been easy for him to begin to compare himself with his brothers,
    <br>"Look at Reuben, Gad, Simeon; they are enjoying with my father.
    <br>Here I am in the prison, for doing nothing wrong. I did good, they repaid me with evil."
    <br>I want you to take note of a valuable truth.
    <br>When Joseph was in the prison, if he had been so busy lamenting, grumbling,
    <br>moody, depressed, sad, overcast, overwhelmed by his challenges,
    <br>he would not have had the time to listen to the complaints of his co-inmates,
    <br>let alone interpret their dream.
    <br>But the interpretation of the dream of the cupbearer of the king was the link
    <br>that finally took him to the throne.
    <br>If he was so busy licking his own wounds, nursing grudges towards his brothers,
    <br>seeing God in a bad light, he would have missed the opportunity
    <br>to help and interpret the dream of the cupbearer
    <br>which finally became the link, the connecting point, the stepping stone that took him to the throne.
    <br>DON'T GET STUCK IN A STOP-OVER!!! ✈️ | Chris Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>Let me illustrate this; I want to share with you a true story.
    <br>This happened to me several years ago.
    <br>I was on a journey flying from South Africa to Greece and I had a transit, a stopover
    <br>in Dubai, the airport there.
    <br>When I looked at the time, I had three hours in between arriving and leaving flights.
    <br>I looked at the situation - I said, "Well - three hours..."
    <br>I was quite tired after not sleeping much the night before.
    <br>I said, "Let me just sit down a little bit and relax."
    <br>In this airport there were some dangerously comfortable seats;
    <br>seats that are too comfortable for an airport.
    <br>They are not supposed to be that comfortable.
    <br>I sat down in one of these seats; when you sit down, your legs go up and your head goes down.
    <br>I said, "Jesus Christ! Thank You, Lord."
    <br>I looked at the time, I said, "Let me just rest for 10-15-20 minutes and move to the gate".
    <br>I closed my eyes.
    <br>When I opened my eyes, do you know what I heard?
    <br>"This is the final call for flight X13 to Greece. We are about to leave now."
    <br>Ah!
    <br>I began running like a headless chicken.
    <br>I run so fast, I realised I left my luggage on the seat - I run back to collect it.
    <br>Running up and down, "Where is the gate? I'm going to miss the flight!",
    <br>not knowing the gate is at the far end of the airport, the furthest possible point.
    <br>By the time I finally reached there, sweating, looking dishevelled, dismayed,
    <br>the lady kindly said to me, "I'm very sorry, sir, your flight has just left."
    <br>She now said one word, "But, sir, we called your name and no one came".
    <br>DON'T GET STUCK IN A STOP-OVER!!! ✈️ | Chris Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>Let my experience serve as a lesson to you.
    <br>Because I got caught up in the transit, I got stuck in the stopover and missed my flight.
    <br>When they called my name, I didn't hear.
    <br>Do you know that many people here today have missed their flight to freedom
    <br>because they were so busy dealing with the troubles of transit?
    <br>Many people today have missed their flight.
    <br>We have been so caught up in our sickness that we have missed our flight to good health.
    <br>We have been so busy worrying about our poverty that we missed our flight to prosperity.
    <br>We have been so busy battling our barriers that we've missed our flight to breakthrough.
    <br>We have been so busy stressing out about our struggles that we missed our flight to success.
    <br>God is calling you, "My son, it is time for your flight. My daughter, it is time for your flight,"
    <br>but you are so busy that you didn't hear His voice and you got stuck in your stopover.
    <br>You were too busy worrying, too busy grumbling, too busy thinking about the challenges,
    <br>thinking about the circumstances, the situation, whereas it is just a transit point;
    <br>it is not your destination, it is not your final landing point - it is just a stopover,
    <br>it is just a stepping stone, it is just a stopping interval.
    <br>Why are we so consumed by our trouble when it is simply a stepping stone to our breakthrough?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Neighbour, don't get stuck in a stopover".
    <br>Don't get stuck in a stopover and miss your flight to freedom.
    <br>Some of you will be asking the question,
    <br>"How do I avoid getting misled or deceived by my challenge, by my situation?
    <br>How do I guard myself against getting stuck in a stopover?"
    <br>And the answer is very simple.
    <br>You have to understand this vital truth.
    <br>As a Christian, every step of your journey is as it should be by divine will.
    <br>If you are called by the Most High God, from beginning to the end,
    <br>your journey has been documented and nothing outside
    <br>your documentary can happen without God's knowledge.
    <br>You may look at me and say, "But Brother Chris, this is a difficult message to understand.
    <br>You don't understand what I'm facing. People are treating me wrongly.
    <br>People are treating me badly. You don't understand the family I'm from.
    <br>I'm from a dysfunctional family, a broken home. How can God be involved in this?
    <br>People have accused me wrongly in my workplace. I have been sacked for no just cause.
    <br>How can you say 'God is aware of this?' "
    <br>We serve a God who often brings good out of evil
    <br>and promotes the designs of His providence even by the sin of men.
    <br>The intention of Joseph's brothers was bad; it was evil, wicked, malicious.
    <br>They intended to throw him in a dry pit and starve him to death
    <br>but God's purpose was to use him as an instrument of providing food not only for his brothers
    <br>but the entire nation.
    <br>What happened?
    <br>God overruled his brothers' evil designs to fulfill his divine purpose.
    <br>I don't know what you are facing today.
    <br>I don't know what your own stopover is, your own challenges.
    <br>Perhaps your are looking at me and thinking about yourself, your situation.
    <br>Perhaps you do good to people, they repay you with evil.
    <br>Perhaps you have been the victim of bullying in your work place,
    <br>people are speaking, spreading rumours against you that are not rooted in truth.
    <br>Perhaps in school, university you have been sidelined
    <br>because you refused to conform to the norms of society, and you are asking,
    <br>"I'm doing the right thing and why are people treating me like this?"
    <br>I want to re-emphasize to you that God can use their evil acts to produce a good result.
    <br>Yes, it is painful.
    <br>Yes, it is challenging.
    <br>Yes, it is often difficult to deal with but it is just a transit point, a stepping stone.
    <br>There is a purpose to your situation.
    <br>There is a purpose to your pain.
    <br>Who knows, maybe in the future because of the pain you have passed through,
    <br>God will use you to help people who are going through that same pain.
    <br>The experience you had will give you that passion and compassion to be able to reach them.
    <br>You lose the fear of your situation when you find the purpose of your situation.
    <br>Perhaps you are looking at me today saying,
    <br>"I've been a wonderful Christian, a church-goer and I'm still barren, after so many years.
    <br>And I know God has destined me to fruitfulness."
    <br>Who knows, brethren, perhaps God is preparing you to receive a child
    <br>that will re-write the history of your family.
    <br>You say, "I'm poor, experiencing poverty, lack".
    <br>Who knows, brethren, God is preparing you for a position of leadership,
    <br>so that by the time you get to the top, you will feel what people feel
    <br>because you know where you are coming from.
    <br>The downfall of man is when he forgets where he is coming from.
    <br>That was what happened with Joseph.
    <br>Joseph was destined to be a blessing to his people, so he had to taste poverty.
    <br>He was destined to be a source of freedom for his people, so he had to taste imprisonment.
    <br>It was at these dark periods of his life that he learned the necessary experience and maturity
    <br>that he would later use in the exalted position of the royal court of Egypt.
    <br>What is your dark moment today?
    <br>What are you facing?
    <br>What are you going through?
    <br>DON'T GET STUCK IN A STOP-OVER!!! ✈️ | Chris Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>By the time you've toiled all night,
    <br>you will be able to recognise the One who is to shed light into your dark moments - Jesus!
    <br>The higher hand that is leading you to something higher,
    <br>so don't get stuck in your stopover and miss your flight to your destiny.
    <br>In conclusion, brethren,
    <br>whenever you are hungry, there will be a strong urge for food.
    <br>Whenever you are thirsty, there will be a strong urge, a desire for water.
    <br>As a Christian, when you face challenges there will be a strong urge to draw closer to God.
    <br>That's how you know you are a Christian.
    <br>That's how you identify yourself as a Christian.
    <br>You can know a Christian that when challenges come,
    <br>those challenges are like a fertilizer that energises their spiritual life,
    <br>those challenges are like a tonic to their anointing.
    <br>They encourage them to speed up their spiritual life to pray the more,
    <br>believe God the more, have faith the more.
    <br>This is how you know a Christian.
    <br>If you understand this principle, no situation can break you, no challenge can overwhelm you.
    <br>In fact, nothing can stop you because you know your troubles will work for your advancement.
    <br>Your challenges will advance your cause.
    <br>Your afflictions will promote your fruitfulness.
    <br>Therefore, to a man of faith, nothing is lacking while everything is necessary
    <br>because there is an unseen Hand in everything that happens under the sun.
    <br>I leave you with the words or Apostle Paul, in that Book of 2 Corinthians 4:17.
    <br>It reads thus:
    <br>"For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us
    <br>an eternal glory that far outweighs them all."
    <br>May God bless His Word in the midst of our hearts
    <br>as we go forward and reach our Promised Land, in Jesus' name.
