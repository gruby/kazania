    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Father, we thank You.
    <br>We believe in Your Word.
    <br>Give thanks to God!
    <br>Right now, open your heart.
    <br>Ask Him to draw you.
    <br>Draw me, Lord, close to You.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Right now, we start the prayer.
    <br>What can cleanse you?
    <br>The blood of Jesus.
    <br>What Can CLEANSE You?
    <br>MASS PRAYER With Prophet T.B. Joshua!
    <br>We need deliverance to enter the realm.
    <br>We need what?
    <br>(Deliverance).
    <br>To enter what?
    <br>(The realm).
    <br>The realm is not something we can just enter like that;
    <br>we need to be delivered from where we are coming from.
    <br>We need to be delivered to enter the realm - where we are going.
    <br>What Can CLEANSE You?
    <br>MASS PRAYER With Prophet T.B. Joshua!
    <br>There is no one here the Lord cannot deliver.
    <br>Everyone - just open your heart.
    <br>Jesus loves you just as He does any of His apostles.
    <br>Say: He loves me just as He does any of His apostles.
    <br>Yes, He loves you.
    <br>He loves me
    <br>I cannot say why
    <br>On Calvary tree
    <br>He suffered for me
    <br>He loves me
    <br>I cannot say why
    <br>Whatever you are facing,
    <br>it could be sickness,
    <br>it could be limitation in progress,
    <br>hardship,
    <br>anything not mentioned,
    <br>Jesus knows.
    <br>You will be delivered today, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Behind it are demons.
    <br>They are responsible for it, the cause of it.
    <br>Now, it is time to deliver you.
    <br>Your body is the temple of God.
    <br>Say: My body is the temple of God.
    <br>If there is anything that is not of God that is connected to you
    <br>- listen to me -
    <br>if there is anything that is not of God that is connected to you
    <br>in whichever way
    <br>- your business, life, health, career, marital home.
    <br>Whatever that is connected to you, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>open your lips and begin to be delivered.
    <br>Disconnect yourself!
    <br>Say: You demon!
    <br>Begin to disconnect yourself, deliver yourself right now, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>What Can CLEANSE You?
    <br>MASS PRAYER With Prophet T.B. Joshua!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Look, you may not know that something is connected to you.
    <br>Where God is taking you to, what you are seeing now, is just an atom.
    <br>You may not know. You may think you have arrived; the best is yet to come.
    <br>Whatever is connected to you, whatever is behind your trouble,
    <br>right now, disconnect yourself! Open your lips.
    <br>Disconnect yourself!
    <br>Say: I disconnect myself, you demon!

    <br>There is a force that has landed in our midst
    <br>and it is moving into our midst to disconnect you from whatever that you are not discerning.

    <br>Say: I will be delivered.

    <br>Whatever you might have eaten through dreams,
    <br>from the table of the enemy,
    <br>from the table of demons,
    <br>that is causing you bad luck,
    <br>that demonizes you,
    <br>be flushed out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be flushed out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be flushed out, by the blood of Jesus!
    <br>Give thanks to God!
    <br>Give thanks to Him!
    <br>The Lord is good, all the time.
    <br>All the time, the Lord is good.
    <br>Give thanks to Him!
    <br>I can see someone being delivered!
