    <br>at that name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>every knee must bow -
    <br>every knee of affliction, oppression, sickness and disease.
    <br>You can see another person vomiting right now the poisonous substances.
    <br>There is no other name by which diseased bodies can be cured,
    <br>by which sinful souls can be saved,
    <br>by which demons can be cast out,
    <br>other than the name of Jesus Christ.

    <br>Be assured that you are free.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting In Nigeria
    <br>So this Anointing Water is for your neighbour, not even for you.
    <br>Because you are free already.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting In Nigeria
    <br>Like I have told you, you have a house sticker, your property sticker.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting In Nigeria
    <br>You have this Anointing Water; I don't know the name to call it.
    <br>Not until it gets to you, it is only proof. That's it.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting In Nigeria
    <br>So, thank you very much.
    <br>Distribution Of The New Anointing Water & Sticker
    <br>To Partners In Nigeria
    <br>So right now you can see the Emmanuel TV Partners receiving the New Anointing Water
    <br>and the New Anointing Sticker.
    <br>We want to make it clear to everyone that the New Anointing Water and the New Anointing Sticker
    <br>are not for sale.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says, you can see what is happening here.
    <br>Immediately when this lady collected the New Anointing Sticker and she just touched it,
    <br>she fell under the power of the Holy Spirit.

    <br>Set Free Through The New Anointing Water
    <br>In Jesus' Name
    <br>My name is Funke. I'm from Ekiti State, Nigeria.
    <br>I was privileged to be invited as an Emmanuel TV Partner
    <br>to collect my New Anointing Sticker and New Anointing Water.
    <br>Before coming here, I was battling with stomach pains since 2013.
    <br>But before I received this New Anointing Water, the man of God touched me
    <br>and when he did I felt something from my head to my toes.
    <br>And to the glory of God, I now feel light in me.
    <br>And after that I was able to touch my stomach.
    <br>I don't have any more pain.
    <br>Before, I couldn't touch my stomach like this due to severe pain since 2013.
    <br>For the glory of God today, I am free.
    <br>I don't have any more pain. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Emmanuel!

    <br>To Partners In Nigeria
    <br>Receiving Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>We are seeing the evidence that indeed the anointing is done in the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
    <br>As they are touching the Anointing Water, the power of God is indeed moving,
    <br>putting an end to every form of sickness and disease, afflictions in their lives.
    <br>You can see the reaction of this sister.
    <br>Receiving Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Tell us what is happening to you now.
    <br>I am just feeling heat.

    <br>Set Free Through The New Anointing Water
    <br>In Jesus' Name
    <br>My name is Stella. I came from Abuja, Nigeria.
    <br>I am a partner of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Before coming, I was having negative thoughts of not coming.
    <br>And I had this heaviness in me that, "What is the purpose of me coming? I should go back."
    <br>I refused to go back. I just had to board the bus and I came to Lagos.
    <br>When I got to Prayer Mountain, when the man of God was praying,
    <br>before he got to me I felt a burning sensation in me.
    <br>I felt so uneasy.
    <br>When he touched me, I fell down.
    <br>I got up again and was just shaking.
    <br>They then said we should collect the Anointing Water and the sticker.
    <br>When I got there I was unable to touch it.
    <br>I was shaking terribly so I just fell down with it.
    <br>I just thank God because I am totally delivered today.
    <br>I am free from every setback and the heaviness in me is gone.
    <br>The burden and everything is gone.
    <br>I thank God. The heat, the sensation inside me, is over.
    <br>Everything is fine.
    <br>I thank You, Lord. I am so strong now and I am free. Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.

    <br>My name is Bukola. I am from Oyo State, Nigeria,
    <br>and I am legal practitioner.
    <br>My mom got an invite from Prophet T.B. Joshua to collect the New Anointing Water
    <br>but because of her age, I came to collect it on her behalf.
    <br>It has been a wonderful experience in the presence of God here.
    <br>I received my healing and deliverance.
    <br>I have been experiencing a lot of pain; I have not been a happy person due to an accident.
    <br>Because of the accident, I had a clavicular fracture in my shoulder and was having pain every day until now.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua touched me, I received my healing.
    <br>The evil spirit manifested and immediately the spirit behind all this affliction, pain and unhappiness left my body.
    <br>I felt very light and the pain disappeared.
    <br>Before now I could not touch the area where the fracture was.
    <br>But now, look at it. Look at my hand.
    <br>I have no more pain.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus. I am healed. I am delivered, in Jesus' name.

    <br>My name is Mrs Mohammed and this is my daughter, Naomi.
    <br>I am an Emmanuel TV Partner and came to collect the New Anointing Water.
    <br>I have been having an eye problem, which is a family problem from my father's side.
    <br>When the man of God passed us, my daughter cried out to him that
    <br>she could not see far when they were writing on the blackboard at school.
    <br>This has been my prayer that my daughter and I would receive our healing at The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God touched us and we are both healed.
    <br>Our eye problems are over, in Jesus' name.
    <br>My name is Naomi. I am Kaduna State, Nigeria.
    <br>And the problem that brought me to The SCOAN is an eye problem.
    <br>I could not see the blackboard in school.
    <br>When the man of God touched me I felt a movement in my eyes and now I am free.
    <br>Emmanuel TV. Changing lives, changing nations, changing the world.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me. Now I can read.
    <br>I just want to thank God for what He has done for us today.
    <br>My household, my family and I are saved.
    <br>I believe that more blessing is on my way.
    <br>Distribution Of The New Anointing Water & Sticker
    <br>To Partners In Nigeria
    <br>My name is Uzogara. I came from Imo State but I reside in Lagos.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is chest and shoulder pain.
    <br>I was told by the doctor that I had high blood pressure and it has been there for too long.
    <br>The doctor also said that my heart is larger than normal and that was the reason for the chest pain
    <br>and the shoulder pain.
    <br>I could not raise my hand properly because of the pain.
    <br>As an Emmanuel TV Partner I was called to come and receive the Anointing Water and Anointing Sticker.
    <br>When I got here, the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>As he laid his hands on me I started shivering. I felt a cold sensation.
    <br>Immediately after his prayer, it was as if something had left me.
    <br>So the pains are not there anymore.
    <br>Before now I could not raise my hand like this.
    <br>Now I can turn my arm 360 degrees.
    <br>I am okay; I am good.
    <br>I thank God for everything. After the healing I don't have any pain anymore.
    <br>I am very happy to receive the Anointing Water and Anointing Sticker.
    <br>I know that it is an advantage to take care of the ones at home
    <br>who are not able or privileged to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>With this I can also minister it to them and they will receive their own healing too.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.

    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting In Nigeria
    <br>You are welcome.
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting In Nigeria
    <br>How many of us are coming here for the first time?
    <br>How do you feel?
    <br>[Great]
    <br>- Do you like this environment?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>We started this area where you sitting now, when we realised that something was about to come ...
    <br>Emmanuel TV Partners Meeting In Nigeria
    <br>... which was first mentioned four years ago.
    <br>We mentioned it four years ago - it is on the record -
    <br>a time is coming when you will come to this church and you will not see anyone.
    <br>I repeated it three years ago
    <br>that the time is very close now
    <br>that when you come to the church and you will not see anyone.
    <br>And two years ago, I rearranged the seats in the church.
    <br>Those who are members will understand what I am talking about.
    <br>I had to remove two seats in between.
    <br>And I said that I was seeing something that would allow us to do this.
    <br>The time has come.
    <br>We knew that a time like this was coming.
    <br>And it has come.
    <br>When the time came and the people were shouting, it was not a surprise.
    <br>Four years ago we started building a studio
    <br>where we would show Emmanuel TV programmes for three years now.
    <br>We started building a studio four years ago and we continued for three years where we are today.
    <br>We were aware that a time like this was coming, and it has come.
    <br>There's nothing we can do about it.
    <br>I hope you enjoy your time here.
    <br>How do you feel praying in an environment like this?
    <br>Because you know prayer is nature.
    <br>Prayer is nature.
    <br>And you now find yourself in the atmosphere of this place. Can you imagine?
    <br>Prayer is nature.
    <br>Because we have not been agreeing with nature - that is why we have been having problems with our prayer.
    <br>We have not been accord with nature.
    <br>The atmosphere like this, we have not been agreeing with it.
    <br>This time is a blessing for us Christians, but we don't know it.
    <br>We see it as a crisis, but it is a blessing.
    <br>It is a blessing to we Christians.
    <br>You have something to test your faith.
    <br>When we don't have anything to test our faith, how do you know you have faith?
    <br>"Let there be light!", and there is light.
    <br>If there is nothing to test your faith, how will you know you have faith?
    <br>These are the challenges we are facing today.
    <br>You say you are faith man but look at you.
    <br>See what is happening around the world today - all over the world.
    <br>You are coming here for the first time, but before now you didn't know that something like this was inside here.
    <br>Not until you enter ...

    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>Life is full of imitation.
    <br>This is why we are very limited in our thinking,
    <br>in our doings and in our ways.
    <br>We are very limited.
    <br>We can't go beyond.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>When you are a type that copies,
    <br>you base your life on copying.
    <br>And there is so much weakness in copying.
    <br>You can imagine how many business cards you have in your pocket -
    <br>you are the architect, you are the the lawyer,
    <br>you are the accountant.
    <br>You are this because you don't know what to do again - you copy.
    <br>Each time you see someone who is prosperous in his career,
    <br>you abandon your career and jump into that career.
    <br>And prosperity is not evidence that you are called.
    <br>You can be rich in doing what you are doing and yet you are not called for that job from Heaven.
    <br>No! You can be very rich in what you are doing and yet it is not your calling from Heaven.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>The end will prove that it is your calling.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The end will prove that what I am doing is my calling from God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Don't be afraid. The end will prove that what you are doing is your calling from God.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>If there's nothing like that, people like me,
    <br>where would I be today?
    <br>This is inherited from the Apostles.
    <br>The price they paid is what I am enjoying today.
    <br>So, the price you are paying - children yet unborn also will live to enjoy them.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>This is why we say the world is coming to an end,
    <br>because everyone is copying.
    <br>No one is patient enough to wait for God,
    <br>to hear from God.
    <br>You copy little things.
    <br>Even in the world today, they encourage copying.
    <br>When your children want to sit for an exam, they give an opportunity for 'first choice' and 'second choice'.
    <br>So, alternative everywhere.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>It will be too soon for you to say, "This is my calling.
    <br>What I'm doing is what I'm called from Heaven to do". No.
    <br>The beginner is not the owner, but the finisher.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The beginner is not the owner of the job, but the finisher.
    <br>When you start well you begin to run faster
    <br>and someone has been struggling to get to you.
    <br>But before getting to the end where you can receive an award,  you suddenly fall down.
    <br>And the one that was coming with effort passes you.
    <br>He will be the one to receive the award.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>The issue of faith is an issue we should critically look into and see how it really affects your life.
    <br>Are you living by faith?
    <br>Are you a faith man?
    <br>If you continue to copy and you are not patient enough to listen to God for direction,
    <br>you will go well and still come back to where you started.
    <br>This is why you see people 'up' and 'down'.
    <br>Everything in life is so epileptic today -
    <br>[ 'up' and 'down' ]
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>A copy cannot stand the test of time.
    <br>This is why when challenges come,
    <br>you lament and complain.
    <br>Challenges will come,
    <br>but a copy man cannot stand the challenges.
    <br>Who is the master of the copy?
    <br>Man is the master of the copy,
    <br>but the Master of the original is God.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD

    <br>A secret: Something that is hidden or concealed.
    <br>A secret: A mystery.
    <br>A secret: Something beyond ordinary human understanding.
    <br>A secret: Unknown to others.
    <br>Proverbs 2:4-5 - "If you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,
    <br>then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God".
    <br>A Secret
    <br>The Secret Of Blessing
    <br>T.B. Joshua
    <br>Those who are to receive must learn to give.
    <br>Every man has something big or small to plant.
    <br>God has not created anyone that does not have something big or small. God has not.
    <br>Everything God has made is a solution to a problem. Everything. Just name it.
    <br>Every person God created is a solution to a problem.
    <br>You are a solution to a problem.
    <br>I am a solution to a problem.
    <br>Every person God created is a solution to a problem.
    <br>And everything God has made is a solution to a problem.
    <br>Jesus taught us here that giving is the beginning of blessing.
    <br>When you give in truth, in faith, that is for God's sake, people around you will start giving to you.
    <br>Anyone who gives is conscious of the future because he would find help if he ever falls on hard times, difficult times.
    <br>That is when there is no money in the pocket.
    <br>If you are a good giver, a cheerful giver, someone is waiting to help.
    <br>What have you to give? That is the question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>Because everything you have is actually being borrowed from God.
    <br>What we are doing is giving back what we have been given from His generous hand.
    <br>What have you to give?
    <br>We see giving as a way of helping those we are giving to, as a result we magnify ourselves above them.
    <br>Giving is an opportunity to reshape our destiny.
    <br>When you give, you are reshaping your destiny.
    <br>In giving, let God be honoured by our offering.
    <br>When you give something with pride and arrogance, you honour yourself and dishonour God.
    <br>A true Christian should see giving as an assignment from God.
    <br>When you know it is an assignment from God, you cannot afford to fail God.
    <br>By giving, we mean making some sacrifice, not giving out only those things you do not need,
    <br>but also those things you cherish, your life depends on.
    <br>A time of giving is a time to show remorse, not a time to show off.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: What have you to give?
    <br>Give it in humility and cheerfulness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again: What have you to give?
    <br>Give it in humility and cheerfulness because everything you have is actually being borrowed from God.

    <br>My name is Sunday and I am from Abuja, Nigeria.
    <br>I was having severe waist pain, chest pain and pains close to my private parts.
    <br>I was also struggling to read the Bible due to poor eyesight.
    <br>After the man of God prayed for me I can bend down and I can now do things that I couldn't do before the prayer.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
    <br>remember that touch is a touch of power to break every yoke of satan
    <br>and to set the people free from all forms of bondage in their lives
    <br>Whatever satan has used as a chain to connect them to himself,
    <br>the Lord God Almighty is disconnecting them now as they receive that touch through the man of God,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>We have been listening to testimonies of those who have received the touch
    <br>and instantly the severe pain they have been nursing disappeared
    <br>and they have been set free for the salvation of their souls.
    <br>And this is what is happening now.
    <br>The man of God is still moving around in the midst of the partners and touching them, in the name of Jesus Christ.

    <br>My name is Honourable Lady Chinwe.
    <br>For the past month now I have had a strange pain here and also in my stomach.
    <br>Whenever I eat, after one hour I will have to use the restroom.
    <br>When I came from Port Harcourt to The SCOAN, I did not eat anything.
    <br>But when we were asked to go and eat in the afternoon,
    <br>I ate and it has not been necessary for me to go to the toilet at all.
    <br>When the man of God touched me, the pains have all disappeared.
    <br>It has been very painful for the past month now, but now I am free. Thank You, Jesus.

    <br>The man of God touched me and I only realised that I was healed when I came to the restroom.
    <br>I don't struggle to urinate anymore. Now I am able to urinate as a normal person does.

    <br>Before now, tell us how far could you raise your hand?
    <br>Only up to here. Somebody had to hold it up for me, but now I can raise it by myself. Thank You, Jesus.

    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Happy Palm Sunday!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We need to celebrate with the little ones. They are outside there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>I know you are feeling His presence.
    <br>Where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>I want to make sure you are happy as I am!
    <br>Tell the viewers all over the world:
    <br>I want to make sure you are happy as I am!
    <br>Those on the sickbed.
    <br>Many are on the sickbed and they are watching you.
    <br>Can you please tell them you want to make sure they are happy as you are.
    <br>And many in the prison yard, tell them:
    <br>I want to make sure you are happy as I am!
    <br>On the air watching the program, tell them:
    <br>I want to make sure you are happy as I am!
    <br>Yes, you can only give that happiness when you have it.
    <br>That is why Christians have to be happy.
    <br>When you are not happy, you cannot give.
    <br>It is what you have you can give out of.
    <br>And you cannot give all; you can only give out of what you have.
    <br>When you are not happy, you cannot give.
    <br>Even when you give money, when you are not happy and you are now giving money to your neighbour,
    <br>it's like you are giving sorrow.
    <br>When you are not happy, and you are rich and your neighbour runs to you for help and you are not happy,
    <br>whatever you give out of that unhappiness is sorrow.
    <br>Your neighbour cannot use it for anything.
    <br>Therefore, what you have been giving in the past, think about it.
    <br>The mood you are in when you are giving those things, and whatever you give that is not joyful, is not from God.
    <br>Happiness can only come from God.
    <br>Whatever is given out of unhappiness is not from God.
    <br>If you pretend to smile and you are not happy, that is not from God.
    <br>This is why many things you have given out, there is no reward from God,
    <br>because you are not giving it out of God.
    <br>You are giving something and after giving it,
    <br>you are now saying to yourself that, "Oh, I know I should not have given this".
    <br>"Oh, my God. Well, I had to give it because they will do this, they will do that to me".
    <br>It means you are not giving it out of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Or you greet a brother of yours, "Good morning, sir".  He says, "Oh, thank you".
    <br>After your brother turns back, you do this.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You're a good giver, but no reward.
    <br>You have not been helping out of God.
    <br>You help, but not out of God.
    <br>You give, but not out of God.
    <br>You greet out of complaining, grumbling.
    <br>You smile out of grumbling.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is better not to give than to give out of grumbling.
    <br>You help someone with millions of Dollars out of grumbling.
    <br>You cannot expect this reward from God, because grumbling is not of God.
    <br>It is the act that follows that help that determines the kind of help you give.
    <br>"Okay, I want to help you. How are you? Come on, let me help you".
    <br>It's not that help that matters, but the force that followed that help.
    <br>It's not that help I'm doing, but the force behind it that will determine the reward.
    <br>I wear a simple dress that you are not expecting me to wear.
    <br>You say, "The man is humble".  Who told you that I'm humble? Is it because I wear a rag?
    <br>I can be very proud and at the same time wear a simple thing.
    <br>It is not what you see, but the force behind what you see. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>It is not what you see, but the force behind what you see.
    <br>This is why the Bible says, "We don't walk by sight; we walk by faith".
    <br>What I'm saying now: A very humble man who is gentle".
    <br>"Look at the simple dress. Look at him".
    <br>Do you know the force behind what he's doing?
    <br>Okay, look at the money.
    <br>If you put blood money down and clean money, will you be able to know the force behind the money?
    <br>Maybe someone just went out to rob and killed the person
    <br>and carried millions of Dollars and now want to use this as an offering.
    <br>You don't know where he's brought the money from and the money is clean as well.
    <br>And the clean and godly money too looks no different.
    <br>It is the force behind the money that determines the type of money it is.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The force behind a man determines the type of man.
    <br>A very humble man - "Oh what a godly man" -
    <br>and yet he is not godly.
    <br>"He's a leader. He likes God. He's humble".
    <br>Who told you that he is humble?
    <br>- It is a force. And this force, we cannot see with our what?
    <br>- [Eyes]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is the force that determines the reward.
    <br>This is why sometimes you say, "This man is trying. He works harder. Why is he suffering?",
    <br>when we are not judged by what we see but what we cannot see.
    <br>As a believer, you are not judged by going to church, by reading your Bible.
    <br>This is why we say that you can pretend to be humble.
    <br>It is the spirit behind it that will determine whether you are pretending or not.
    <br>People like me, I am scared when it is time for thanksgiving because I don't know if you are coming with blood money.
    <br>What can the man of God use that kind of blood money for?
    <br>Is he going to bless the man?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour: What we receive from our members
    <br>as an offering, as thanksgiving,
    <br>that is killing us.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Meeting
    <br>The wicked people like recognition or they cannot give.
    <br>If the pastor does praise them and recognise them, then they cannot give. They like recognition.
    <br>If you want to do away with and avoid these people, don't praise them or receive it directly.
    <br>If you don't receive something directly from the killer, he will not give it to you,
    <br>because he wants to be recognised.
    <br>They like praise. That is their reward, because they have no reward from God.
    <br>But their reward is that praise.
    <br>To know them and to recognise them is their reward.
    <br>What comes from God goes to God.
    <br>See me, I am moving.
    <br>It is not this moment that matters.
    <br>The force behind this moment will determine the reward.
    <br>Now, I want to pray for this man.
    <br>I am walking towards him.
    <br>This moment does not matter, but the force behind it
    <br>- who is leading me, what is the force behind this move -
    <br>will determine the reward.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No one can get healed without faith.
    <br>If I am coming and I have that in my heart that, "Will this man be healed?",
    <br>and that doubt fills my heart. If I pray for the man, I want the man to come back tomorrow.
    <br>That is the method of doubt - "Come back tomorrow and let us see your condition".
    <br>Faith is now:  Faith acts now, believes now, confesses now.
    <br>Faith acts now.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Faith acts now.
    <br>Faith acts now, heals now.
    <br>Faith acts now, heals now, delivers now.
    <br>Faith acts now, heals now, delivers now, blesses now.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>Faith is present tense.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And if you are not of God ... there is no neutral place.
    <br>If you are not of God, you will be of satan.
    <br>If you are of God, then you will be filled with faith,
    <br>because only faith moves, talks and walks with Him.
    <br>If you are not of God, you will be filled with doubt.
    <br>I want to pray with you.
    <br>Doubt: "Will this prayer be answered? Will God answer me?" - because I am not of Him.
    <br>If I now pray, it is not going to happen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't let us deceive ourselves.
    <br>90% of your actions cannot be judged on the outside.
    <br>But the force behind your action determines where the action comes from.
    <br>Everybody says, "In the name of Jesus".
    <br>We cannot just because of that say, "He is calling Jesus".
    <br>You can be calling Jesus, but the force behind that calling is of satan.
    <br>You don't need a licence to call the name Jesus.
    <br>But when you call it genuinely, you need a licence from Jesus.
    <br>A licence means you will be adopted by the Holy Spirit to call that name genuinely.
    <br>In the same way, you are free to have a copy of the Bible.
    <br>All you need is money.
    <br>If you have your money, just walk into the bookshop.
    <br>They will not ask you, "Are you a Christian?".
    <br>They need money to give you a copy of the Bible.
    <br>When we know this, we will be able to train our children.

    <br>Don't let anybody deceive you with their appearance.
    <br>He says, "Good morning, sir".
    <br>That "Good morning, sir", you can turn back and he will be the one to kill you.
    <br>Or somebody who is responsible for the death of the deceased. While people are crying, he is the killer.
    <br>He will now come back and will go there and start crying.
    <br>And people will say, "Don't die. It's alright", whereas he is the one that killed the deceased.
    <br>Is that not action?
    <br>And he will cry genuinely. The tears will come out - not that he will pretend. You will see tears coming out.
    <br>And he will be the one to join them, shouting and crying, "He is my brother. He is my dear friend".
    <br>But he will be cursing the person that killed the man.
    <br>"God will do this, God will do that", and he's the one that ...
    <br>What do we do about this?
    <br>In a service you can call the name Jesus a million times as a demonstration to show people that you are a believer,
    <br>a true man of God.
    <br>It is the force behind an accomplishment.
    <br>- The force behind what?

    <br>Viewers, thank you over there.
