    <br>FLESH EATING ULCER DESTROYED
    <br>Barely able to walk due to a rotting leg covered with wounds,
    <br>this lady hobbles along, assisted by a man on one side and a walking stick on the other.
    <br>Her strife is a harsh reality.
    <br>Her pain is felt as she slowly moves with this shameful and painful condition.
    <br>The leg cancer has made this young lady old due to the torment it has caused her to go through;
    <br>pain, isolation and rejection because of the nature of the disease.
    <br>This is Paulina Godwin's lower leg.
    <br>Her anguish is obvious due to the raw and fragile state of the cancerous wounds.
    <br>Her skin is peeling, as the cancer destroys from the inside out.
    <br>The 28 year old's leg is so ravaged it is difficult to behold,
    <br>but for the glory of God, she willingly shows the horrendous state
    <br>the deadly disease has caused her lower leg.
    <br>My name is Mrs Paulina Godwin.
    <br>I am 28 years old.
    <br>I woke up and discovered that I had pain in my leg.
    <br>That night, when I touched that very place, it was very hot.
    <br>That was how my leg started to become deformed.
    <br>From then, it became like this.
    <br>Since this problem began, I have not been feeling well.
    <br>The pain - I cannot withstand it.
    <br>Since then, I have been feeling so much pain - in my head, heart and various other places.
    <br>I believe that I will receive my healing today.
    <br>Paulina's leg cancer has affected her greatly but it has not affected her faith.
    <br>Despite the immense pain, she still believes Jesus Christ is the same,
    <br>the Master Healer able to heal her.
    <br>This is the moment of prayer.
    <br>T.B. Joshua stands close by with his arm outstretched towards Mrs Godwin's leg.
    <br>With his shoe removed, T.B. Joshua uses his own leg as a point of contact
    <br>for the Holy Spirit to use to bring healing to Paulina's decaying leg.
    <br>Holding her walking stick, he motions for her to stand, which she does unassisted.
    <br>She then proceeds to walk along without help.
    <br>This instant change is a sign that healing has taken place.
    <br>A few weeks later, Mrs Paulina Godwin came back with a different story to tell -
    <br>one of victory, restoration and God's grace.
    <br>Let's watch.
    <br>FLESH EATING ULCER DESTROYED
    <br>This time, Mrs Paulina Godwin proudly shows us her healed and healthy leg.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Only small marks remain as proof that she was once terribly sick
    <br>with a rotting leg, as seen on the other side of the screen.
    <br>There are no natural words to describe this, except to say, "Thank You, Jesus Christ",
    <br>who is worthy to be praised.
    <br>Madam, can you tap the place where you were having the pain before?
    <br>No pain.
    <br>- Could you tap it like this before?
    <br>- No.
    <br>Can you stamp the foot on the floor?
    <br>- Are you having pain?
    <br>- No pain.
    <br>- Could you do it like that before?
    <br>- Not at all.
    <br>- Why?
    <br>- Because of the pain.
    <br>- But right now?
    <br>- I am OK.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Paulina Godwin.
    <br>The first time I came, I was brought here by my husband and some of my friends.
    <br>The pain was so much that I could not even sleep at night.
    <br>I could not walk. I could not eat.
    <br>I could not even go to the toilet or use the bathroom by myself.
    <br>I was placed on the prayer line.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua stretched his hand towards my leg
    <br>and stretched his own toes on my knees.
    <br>Instantly, I received my healing and stood up from that moment and started walking.
    <br>The man of God did not collect anything from me;
    <br>rather, he is the one giving me money.
    <br>- Are you feeling any pain?
    <br>- No pain at all.
    <br>One of the visitors listening to Paulina's testimony
    <br>steps forward to touch her leg, confirming Christ's perfect healing.
