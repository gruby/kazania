    <br>GOOD MORNING AND WIN TODAY
    <br>Good morning viewers all over the world.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>This is a time to commemorate the death and resurrection of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ!
    <br>Yes, indeed viewers. It is all about Jesus Christ.
    <br>What a unique time to celebrate Easter!
    <br>This is the very first time in my life that I'm celebrating Easter in this kind of circumstances -
    <br>lockdown everywhere!
    <br>This is Easter without handshakes, without embracing your friends and family,
    <br>Easter without attending any kind of special service.
    <br>We may be locked down but our faith can never be locked down!
    <br>You are right; we may not be able to shake hands but our faith can shake hands.
    <br>We may not be able to hug but our faith can hug.
    <br>We may not be able to gather but our hearts can gather because faith is of the heart.
    <br>What is the state of your heart right now?
    <br>Are you in tune with God or are your hearts restless and uneasy?
    <br>Are you afraid of this or that?
    <br>We are in a pandemic that is troubling the hearts and stealing the hope and faith of so many.
    <br>This is the aim and objective of satan, the author of this virus.
    <br>Look at the way we, so-called people of faith are reacting to the situation -
    <br>as if it was never mentioned in the Bible, as if it was never Scriptural, as if it was never foretold.
    <br>Don't forget what the Bible says in Matthew 24.
    <br>I read from verse 6.
    <br>"You will hear of wars and rumours of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed.
    <br>Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.
    <br>Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
    <br>There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
    <br>All these are the beginning of birth pains."
    <br>Viewers, you can see what the Bible is telling us here.
    <br>It's true today, so many of us Christians - this is a time when we are crying, running helter-skelter,
    <br>complaining and panicking as if this was not predicted.
    <br>This belittles us and belittles our faith, if truly we are Christians.
    <br>Yes, exactly, we can understand others if they behave this way but what of we, people of faith?
    <br>This is exposing what we truly believe.
    <br>This is what is in the Bible to prepare us.
    <br>But the question is: Are we prepared - when we are reacting to fear and panic among us?
    <br>So what does the Bible say of the times we are in?
    <br>This is what our leaders are supposed to educate their followers about.
    <br>A time like this has been spoken about, it has been written about.
    <br>You will see it in the Books of Daniel, Matthew, Revelation -
    <br>so that when it comes, we will not be unprepared.
    <br>But going by what we see happening now, we doubt if there are Christians,
    <br>considering this attitude of fear and panic among us.
    <br>This is religious.
    <br>Christianity is not a religion; it is a relationship.
    <br>Therefore, in this Easter period, let us dismiss panic and fear and receive resurrection in your life!
    <br>Resurrection is to revive our hope, joy, comfort, love, confidence, forgiveness, love and faith
    <br>which sickness might have stolen.
    <br>Once again, Happy Easter!
    <br>Viewers, there is one thing that we must consider.
    <br>There are a few things that are more dangerous than a person with an unexamined life.
    <br>This Easter period actually offers us an opportunity to reassess our lives.
    <br>Ask yourself: How many people have I helped today?
    <br>How many people have I prayed with today?
    <br>How many people have I encouraged today?
    <br>You who say, "I don't have", find out what is in your hands right now and look for someone who needs it.
    <br>I can assure you there is someone out there who is in dire need of what you have for their survival.
    <br>But today, we keep saying, "If only I had enough money, resources, time, I would help the poor, do this, that."
    <br>Yet, our idea of "if only" keeps robbing us of our blessings.
    <br>You are right. Instead of waiting for this lockdown to come to an end,
    <br>let us ask ourselves what we can do to make the most of this opportunity.
    <br>Easter is the period Christ made a change in our lives.
    <br>What change are we making in the lives of others?
    <br>Giving is not only in monetary terms; you can give a phone call to your neighbour!
    <br>Do you realise that just a word of encouragement
    <br>to someone who is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts at this time -
    <br>just that word of encouragement could save them.
    <br>Just a word of counsel can rescue a couple on the verge of divorce or domestic violence.
    <br>Just a prayer may bring peace to someone under the bondage of this monster called fear.
    <br>Exactly and we are just talking about a phone call; anyone can make that phone call.
    <br>In the same vein, you could go and get some foodstuffs, resources, provisions
    <br>and go and give it to that elderly man on your road
    <br>who you know is afraid to come out because of these circumstances.
    <br>Yes. To that homeless woman on the streets.
    <br>And to that refugee in your community, in our community.
    <br>There is so much to be done.
    <br>This is not the time to apportion blame, to provoke others or to speak negatively.
    <br>Viewers, instead of criticising our society or our fellow man, let us do what is good to change the bad we see.
    <br>But you may be asking: How can I do this practically?
    <br>This is the time to make the Word work!
    <br>This is the time to put our faith into practice, for faith without works is dead.
    <br>How can we accomplish this vital mission of the Gospel if our leaders, our pastors
    <br>are too busy attacking one another?
    <br>If our pastors cannot work together as one, how will their members work together?
    <br>If there is disunity among followers, what will happen among others?
    <br>How then would you make a change?
    <br>Let us remember, whatever the name of the church - the camouflage may be different
    <br>but there is a common enemy.
    <br>Our understanding may be different but satan is our common enemy.
    <br>Satan is our common enemy.
    <br>So pastors, please, let us protect the faith of our members.
    <br>Little things we say to or about their leaders can really affect their members' faith.
    <br>One thing is certain: Our followers must be respected
    <br>and, above all, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ must be respected - the hope of glory.
    <br>As Colossians 1 verse 27 says:
    <br>The essence of the true Church is Christ in you, the Hope of glory.
    <br>Let us come together and pray for one another.
    <br>Nothing makes us love someone so much as praying for them.
    <br>That you are a pastor does not mean you are an island.
    <br>No one is an island; no one is all-knowing.
    <br>We all came from the same root, faith. Jesus is Lord.
    <br>The only difference is the level of our understanding.
    <br>Yes, you are right, just as 1 Corinthians 3 from verse 4 to 7 says, and I'm going to read that:
    <br>"...when one says, 'I am of Paul,' and another, 'I am of Apollos,' are you not carnal?
    <br>Who then is Paul and who is Apollos,
    <br>but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one.
    <br>I planted, Apollos watered but God gave the increase.
    <br>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase."
    <br>Whether we plant or water, we are a team.
    <br>Exactly. And what does this mean, viewers, practically, pastors?
    <br>Where you are weak, your fellow pastor may be strong
    <br>and where you are strong, your fellow pastor may be weak.
    <br>What you understand, I may not understand it and what I understand, you may not understand it.
    <br>But we are one another's strength.
    <br>If we are one another's strength, let us approach each other gently, no matter how wrong.
    <br>To restore one gently, for example, would be to make a private phone call to the person in question
    <br>instead of publicly airing and addressing our concerns.
    <br>It's true we're in difficult times; no one will deny it.
    <br>We are in difficult times
    <br>but these difficult times are the soil in which our faith should flourish for the world to see.
    <br>The world needs to see our unity and love for one another at this time.
    <br>Where unbelievers are blinded to Jesus, they will behold Him through our love for one another.
    <br>To celebrate Easter is to celebrate love.
    <br>So, let us do love, act love and let love lead.
    <br>Above all, Jesus said, "Father forgive them."
    <br>Accused and accuser, you and I, we are to forgive ourselves.
    <br>I forgive you and you forgive me, and let us move forward.
    <br>Remember that we have not committed any unpardonable sin.
    <br>This is what Jesus is telling us here.
    <br>Viewers, right now, we need a blessing from you.
    <br>What could that be?
    <br>From the beginning of this programme, we didn't ask for any money.
    <br>There were no bank accounts shown on the screen. So what can be the blessing we are asking for from you?
    <br>Right now, as you sit watching, forgive.
    <br>As you stand to pray, forgive.
    <br>As you sit around the table eating with your family, forgive.
    <br>As you walk, as you lie down to sleep, forgive.
    <br>Viewers, wherever you are, as you are watching us right now, forgive.
    <br>And remember, we have not committed any unpardonable sin.
    <br>Whether you are accused or accuser, look around you and see who you need to forgive now
    <br>before the celebration of Easter.
    <br>For this is what Easter is all about.
    <br>Jesus died for us. He paid the price for our sins and through our faith in Him,
    <br>He forgives us as we open our hearts.
    <br>Right now, open your heart to forgive whoever may have offended you or whoever you may have offended.
    <br>Accused or accuser, no matter how great or small the sin, forgive.
    <br>Remember the words of Jesus. He said, "Father, forgive them."
    <br>Take note of the word, "them."
    <br>"Forgive them."
    <br>Is there someone that you sent to prison over the wrong they have done to you? Forgive.
    <br>Even if they took the life of your loved one, forgive.
    <br>Remember the words of Jesus, "Forgive them all."
    <br>Accused or accuser, the sin, whether great or small, forgive.
    <br>Jesus said, "Father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing."
    <br>Right now, forgive.
    <br>Forgive them all.
    <br>Jesus said, "Forgive and you shall be forgiven."
    <br>Forgive and you shall continue to win, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Right now, release forgiveness. This is what Easter is all about.
    <br>No matter the sin - great or small - forgive them.
    <br>This is the message of Easter.
    <br>Without that, you are not celebrating Easter; you are celebrating something else.
    <br>Let us come together and forgive so we may all come together and say,
    <br>Happy Easter, in Jesus' name!
    <br>As we as we free our spirit, release forgiveness, we will indeed celebrate Happy Easter!
    <br>Viewers, thank you so much for staying with us.
    <br>Any moment from now, Prophet TB Joshua will be coming into our midst.
    <br>So God bless you and get ready!
    <br>And from the Emmanuel TV family, we want to greet you once again.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>HAPPY EASTER

    <br>GOOD MORNING AND WIN TODAY
    <br>Emmanuel, viewers.
    <br>Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>The resurrection of our Lord, Jesus Christ is the joy of Christians.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>The Spirit of God is going to lead me to talk about what it means to be a Christian.
    <br>When we become a Christian, does it mean we cannot sin or wrong?
    <br>This is what we're going to talk about today
    <br>because the resurrection of our Lord, Jesus Christ is the joy of Christians all over the world,
    <br>the joy of His friends.
    <br>Let me give you some of the Bible passages that will give you details about resurrection.
    <br>You have Matthew 27 from verse 1 to the end and Matthew 28 verses 5 to 11,
    <br>but I would advise you to take it from verse 1 to the end.
    <br>Romans 6 verses 8 to 11 or you take it from verse 1 to 11.
    <br>And Titus 3 verses 3 to 6; that will be our theme, my proof text today.
    <br>So I'm taking you to the book of Titus chapter 3 verses 3 to 6:
    <br>"At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures.
    <br>We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.
    <br>But when the kindness and love of God our Saviour appeared,
    <br>He saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of His mercy.
    <br>He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
    <br>whom He poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Saviour."
    <br>So, you take your time to read.
    <br>Once again, Happy Easter!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>As a minister of God, I have seen that people give numerous reasons for calling themselves Christians.
    <br>For instance, they say, "I was born a Christian and I grew up in the church."
    <br>"I am a Christian because my parents are believers."
    <br>"I am a Christian because I am a publisher of the Bible."
    <br>"I am a Christian because I am the founder or a General Overseer of a church."
    <br>"I am a Christian because I am convinced that Jesus is the Son of God."
    <br>My problem with these answers is that they don't mention
    <br>the only reason that qualifies someone as a Christian.
    <br>I take it again:
    <br>My problem with these answers is that they don't mention
    <br>the only reason that qualifies someone as a Christian.
    <br>Viewers, here is the challenge.
    <br>You can attend church and not be a Christian.
    <br>You can read the Bible and not be a Christian.
    <br>You can eliminate bad habits and try to be a moral person and still not be a Christian.
    <br>All these habits are good but the actions alone do not make a person a Christian.
    <br>Who is a Christian then, viewers?
    <br>A Christian is a person whom God has forgiven through the finished work of Jesus Christ on the Cross,
    <br>as the Book of Titus 3:3-6 said.
    <br>We are Christians because of the finished work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
    <br>Man is a sinner who has fallen short of God's standard.
    <br>God came to the earth in the person of Jesus Christ, died for us and paid for our sin.
    <br>Through our faith in Him, we receive His righteousness, we receive His forgiveness of our sins
    <br>and the gift of eternal life.
    <br>Eternal
    <br>Eternal life
    <br>I want to live eternal life
    <br>God save my soul
    <br>Viewers all over the world, once again, Happy Easter!
    <br>Jesus died on the Cross for me and you.
    <br>He died for us, He loves us, He forgives us,
    <br>and when we open our heart, He forgives us.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Acts of the Apostles, chapter 16 verses 30 to 31.
    <br>This is the case of a law enforcement officer who once asked Apostle Paul the most important question:
    <br>What must I do to be saved?
    <br>Paul answered, "Believe in the Lord Jesus; you will be saved."
    <br>Here is the point, viewers!
    <br>Being a Christian is not about what you do; it is about what Christ Jesus has done.
    <br>He loves us, He died for us, He forgives us when we open our hearts to believe.
    <br>Viewers, I have two issues for you today.
    <br>Now, when you are a Christian, can you do wrong or commit sin?
    <br>A Christian can do wrong.
    <br>When a Christian sins, he does not lose his place as a son but loses his fellowship.
    <br>He can immediately go to God about his behaviour and the Lord will forgive him
    <br>and help him not to make the same mistake again.
    <br>When we make a mistake, we run to God; we do not run from God.
    <br>When a tree is cut down, the root will still be there.
    <br>Our faith may fail but not utterly.
    <br>Our faith may fail, not fall off.
    <br>Faith is our root.
    <br>Faith is our seed for it remains in us.
    <br>We always come to repentance each time we miss the mark;
    <br>that is a true Christian, a true believer -
    <br>I mean, those who are born of the Word and the Spirit.
    <br>Not only most we have God's Word in order to be born again, we must have God's Spirit.
    <br>Though there may be many instances of failing in the faith of true believers,
    <br>it is certain that there shall not be a total and final failure of their faith because faith is their root.
    <br>Viewers, how do we know a true believer?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask me at this moment. How do we know a true born-again?
    <br>How do we know a true Christian?
    <br>We know a true Christian when he runs to God each time he misses the mark.
    <br>Each time he does wrong, he runs to God.
    <br>We know a true Christian, a true believer when he runs to God each time he misses the mark.
    <br>When we make a mistake, we run to God; we do not run from Him.
    <br>Viewers, let me just come down.
    <br>Finally let us take a look at Psalm 51 verse 3.
    <br>Yes, what does it say here?
    <br>"For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me."
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>Our sin is always before us - what does that mean?
    <br>This means the guilt of our sin is always troubling our heart.
    <br>And when our heart is troubled, it cannot be at its best.
    <br>We worship God, we are in line with God, when our heart is at its best.
    <br>This is the man with a conscience -
    <br>a true believer, a true born-again, a true Christian.
    <br>I want to leave you here for prayer.
    <br>Viewers, Happy Easter!
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Before the prayer, I need to let you know once again that this prayer is not time-bound.
    <br>Any time you hear it, it maintains God's presence.
    <br>It maintains God's power. It maintains God's anointing.
    <br>It maintains God's grace any time you hear it.
    <br>Thank you. Let us pray.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>When we stand to pray, forgive.
    <br>This is what Easter is all about -
    <br>to be free from holding offence, free from holding grudges, free from holding malice.
    <br>This is what Easter is all about - love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Your neighbour can be someone who does not share the same faith with you - love them all.
    <br>This is what Easter is all about.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>In this way, you will continue to win and win big!
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>Resurrection is to bring back to life peace, comfort, joy, good health which sickness has stolen!
    <br>Whatever that has been taken from you - be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it your health - be restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be it your career - be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it your finances - be restored, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever in your life that has been in a state of disuse - be resurrected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to resurrect!
    <br>Be resurrected, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Once again, resurrection is all about forgiveness.
    <br>Forgive us as we forgive those who have wronged us, who sin against us.
    <br>Free from holding offence, free from holding grudges, malice.
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Whatever that has been taken from you - be restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be it your health - be restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Be it your finances, your business - be restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>We want to feel Your hands in our own hands.
    <br>We want to be beside You, Lord Jesus.
    <br>Whatever that has been taken from you -
    <br>be it your business, be it your career, be it your health, be it your marriage -
    <br>be restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Jesus loves you.
    <br>I can see your health being restored, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>I can see your finances being restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see your marriage being restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I can see your career being restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Resurrection is to bring back to life peace, comfort, joy and good health which sickness has stolen, has taken!
    <br>I can see your life being restored, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>To maintain your blessing, determine to set aside a special time to read your Bible with devotion
    <br>and I want to encourage you how to read your Bible.
    <br>Read your Bible slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>HAPPY EASTER
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want to share with you one of my habits.
    <br>It is all about fitness.
    <br>Happy Easter!
    <br>I want you to be fit for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>What is good for me is good for you.
    <br>For me, exercise is a way of life.
    <br>We were created to do everything as an exercise.
    <br>We were created to do everything as an exercise
    <br>because God wants us to stay active in order to keep our bodies functioning.
    <br>Viewers, let me give you a good example of what I'm talking about.
    <br>Imagine a car that is permanently parked and another one that is being used.
    <br>No matter how new these cars are, the parked one will depreciate faster.
    <br>Viewers, this is the case of our bodies when we remain inactive.
    <br>Many sicknesses and diseases we are suffering from today were nursed over time.
    <br>We brought them about through our habits - sitting all the time, eating all the time, sleeping all the time,
    <br>avoiding keeping your body warm, avoiding keeping your body in motion.
    <br>A cold body is dead body and a warm body is a living one.
    <br>Let us ask ourselves: How many times have you been out in the sun?
    <br>How many times have you decided to climb the stairs, instead of taking a lift, just as exercise?
    <br>Without moving around, without stretching our bodies, we are giving room to a terminal disease.
    <br>This is why I am sharing this experience, my habit with you; it's good for you.
    <br>Many of our chores, tasks we ask our domestic helps to do are actually good for our physical fitness,
    <br>for example, sweeping the floor.
    <br>When we are sweeping the floor, we engage the whole system.
    <br>When you are washing - either standing or bending - you are engaging the whole system.
    <br>They are good for you!
    <br>When we cannot bend down as we are trying to wear shoes,
    <br>as we are trying to wash our feet, this means there is a problem.
    <br>Be careful of a terminal disease.
    <br>Take your time to encourage the sick ones to engage in some physical activities.
    <br>Certain things are more rewarding than financial assistance.
    <br>Those who are on the sickbed, who have been lying down for long without being able to turn -
    <br>look for them and help them to turn.
    <br>Those who cannot sit up - help them sit up.
    <br>Certain things are more rewarding than financial assistance.
    <br>Those who are lonely - keep them company.
    <br>Those who cannot eat, feed them; encourage them to eat.
    <br>If water is left in a container, over time, it will change colour.
    <br>This is the case of our body.
    <br>Viewers, this is the case of our body when it remains inactive.
    <br>God bless you, viewers.
