    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>Let me talk to you, brother, here.
    <br>You left home because of your wife.
    <br>This is the second time now.
    <br>Your wife should leave home because you have suffered so much.
    <br>You are only one in your family.
    <br>Please come.
    <br>Your wife is using a charm.
    <br>You left home because of your wife.
    <br>I'm looking at you.
    <br>Please come down. I'm talking to the brother.
    <br>You left your home because of your wife,
    <br>because of the pressure given to you by your wife.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>I need to see you, counsel you and talk to you because you have suffered so much.
    <br>Okay, sir.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Not only deliverance, I have to counsel you.
    <br>- Okay.
    <br>- Thank you.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>My names are Joseph Eden. I am from Delta State, Nigeria.
    <br>The prophecy was true.
    <br>Diplomatically, I brought my wife here today
    <br>and the other woman who has a baby with me.
    <br>Why I brought the woman was because yesterday, after I saw the man of God,
    <br>my wife just called me and I told her that he said she was using a charm on me.
    <br>God will forgive you.
    <br>All that I said, he never saw the importance of it.
    <br>Then, he used my words to fight his wife.
    <br>You could not see any other statement and good word I said.
    <br>Charm - that is the only thing you see.
    <br>Man of God, when I told her that, she said that the other woman
    <br>was the one using the charm and both of them are here.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>What are you causing in the House of God now?
    <br>Did I ask you to bring the both of them?
    <br>No.
    <br>Why did you bring them both?
    <br>Because they have different characters and the way my wife put it
    <br>that it was the other woman who was using the charm.
    <br>Let's call them both.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>I want to first of all thank the two women for coming.
    <br>When they heard the name 'Jesus Christ', they came.
    <br>I want to thank you.
    <br>I will not go by what your husband is saying, because he is now using my words.
    <br>He didn't see anything else, but the issue of the charm is the one being mentioned now.
    <br>Whoever honours a prophet will receive a prophet's reward.
    <br>I want to thank you for coming here after merely hearing 'T.B. Joshua'
    <br>and even what your husband said to you that 'T.B. Joshua said that you used a charm'.
    <br>After hearing about a charm, you could have said, "No, I'm not coming to The SCOAN".
    <br>Nobody can force you, but still you said, "I must be here", because you respect God.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I am talking to my mom. Madam, thank you.
    <br>Many may not look at it from that angle,
    <br>that imagine you just say to your wife, "Prophet T.B. Joshua said that you are using a charm".
    <br>If it were a woman who has no respect for God, and not a believer ...
    <br>"Whether I use it or not, I am not coming. Tell T.B. Joshua I am not coming".
    <br>But because she has honour and respect for God.
    <br>So, thank you.
    <br>Man of God, the woman beside me is my wife; I married her legally.
    <br>The other woman has a child with me.
    <br>What led to it was that when I married her, I did not have peace of mind.
    <br>Who?
    <br>When I married her, I did not have peace of mind at home.
    <br>Do you mean that right from the first day when you married this woman, you did not have peace of mind?
    <br>No.
    <br>When you met this woman as a lady from outside
    <br>and you people started to see each other and you started with sitting in the house
    <br>and somebody was acting as intermediary between you and her,
    <br>did you see her as someone who was very rude before you married her?
    <br>No.
    <br>Okay. After marrying her, did she become very rude to you?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Note, I said 'after marrying her' - the day you married her.
    <br>After marrying her, the next month she became rude to me.
    <br>She wants to control me.
    <br>She wants to turn me like a barber's chair.
    <br>She wants to control me - that was the problem.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>Man of God, this woman has money and we were living well.
    <br>But if I went to that woman's place, if I ate salad here and if she even gave me bitter leaf,
    <br>I would have peace of mind there.
    <br>"Huh? If this woman gives you salad?".
    <br>If I go there to eat bitter leaf, I would have peace of mind there because of her attitude towards me.
    <br>You mean, if this woman gives you salad, and this one gives you bitter leaf, you prefer bitter leaf?
    <br>Yes. I have peace of mind there.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Because of her attitude towards me.
    <br>The way she is misbehaving towards me is like she treats me like a child;
    <br>she is so bossy and I can't take that.
    <br>I am from a ghetto, although I am from a privileged family,
    <br>but I am from a ghetto.
    <br>I can't take it.
    <br>Which one is ghetto?
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>Man of God, this lady has married before and has six children.
    <br>Who?
    <br>This other lady.
    <br>Please, you married this one legally.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>This one - did you marry her legally?
    <br>No.
    <br>Please, wait. This is the one we are talking about.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Let's talk about legally before we talk about illegally.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What made me leave home is this, man of God.
    <br>The child I had with her, my son, is about two years old.
    <br>The children she had with me, I will take them along with my son
    <br>and her other daughter when we are going out.
    <br>Who?
    <br>My children, the ones she had with me are a boy and a girl.
    <br>Okay, the question: Do you mean she has children with someone else?
    <br>The other woman?
    <br>I mean, this one.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She had a child before I married her.
    <br>Legally.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>You met this woman as a rich woman or are you the one that raised her?
    <br>Although she had money, I was the one who elevated her with my own money
    <br>because she used to do international business and I work with Shell.
    <br>I used to take money - one million to two million Naira -
    <br>from my cooperative account and give it to her for her to travel.
    <br>Okay. Because she's rude to you, that is the problem.
    <br>That is just the problem, man of God.
    <br>Is there any other problem?
    <br>No.
    <br>The love is there, but it is only that she is very rude.
    <br>I don't want to die young!
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>She doesn't take my word.
    <br>If I tell her to do this, she doesn't want to do it.
    <br>She wants to do things on her own.
    <br>Okay. It is alright.
    <br>I am going to meet my sister before I ask you a question.
    <br>We need to ask God.
    <br>No matter the challenges, the problems you are facing or the mountains in this marriage,
    <br>we need to ask God's opinion about this marriage.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>We are not going to listen to voices of challenges and act out of character -
    <br>that the woman is rude, the woman is this, the woman is that.
    <br>We still need to ask God's opinion; what is God's opinion about all this.
    <br>Because oftentimes, God uses foolish things like this to cement the marriage properly.
    <br>Oftentimes God uses foolish things - the woman is very rude; that rudeness you are talking about -
    <br>to cement the marriage.
    <br>And the marriage will become so strong and people will admire the marriage.
    <br>Every good marriage you are seeing today, when you ask them what they have gone through,
    <br>what they went through, before they were finally established as a good marriage, good couple,
    <br>they will mention to you that
    <br>one of these situations we have mentioned now is one of the things they passed through.
    <br>We can't just jump to conclusions.
    <br>Let's ask God's opinion about this marriage.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>Do you have any other issues, apart from being rude?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I want to say something, man of God.
    <br>I know that I erred by having a child outside of the matrimonal home with this lady.
    <br>Was it because my madam here was very rude - that is why you went out?
    <br>Yes. I was not comfortable, but I did not want to break the marriage.
    <br>I just had to forge ahead.
    <br>When she wanted to create trouble, I would just leave the house.
    <br>I would leave for one or two weeks.
    <br>I have run from the home more than 20 times.
    <br>If I left, maybe in a week's time, she would beg me and I would come back to the house.
    <br>I don't want to fight; I don't want to create a scene - just to manage the marriage.
    <br>How many children does my sister have with you?
    <br>Two - a boy and a girl.
    <br>- And her?
    <br>- One boy.
    <br>She has six before.
    <br>Forget about that; I am not interested in that.
    <br>Okay. That's all.
    <br>No, man of God.
    <br>Why I was annoyed when I talked to her was that I had begged her not to go
    <br>and do anything like prayer, because if she did such a thing this house would break -  there would be a problem.
    <br>You told who?
    <br>I begged her.
    <br>Why did you say she should not go and pray?
    <br>When I say 'prayer', I am talking about charms or juju.
    <br>I said that if she did that there would be problems in the house.
    <br>I bought a car for her; I begged her.
    <br>What I say is what you want to use against this woman.
    <br>Please listen to me. I am the one who must talk. Okay.
    <br>It is recently that this woman, out of frustration and tension. Is that so?
    <br>Yes, Man of God!
    <br>Man of God, this woman here ...
    <br>Wait! Don't talk.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>Please wait. Out of frustration and tension - she is lonely. She doesn't know how to go about it.
    <br>Of recent, somebody deceived her to a spiritualist.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Ok, tell me. You are rubbing something.
    <br>The spiritualist I went to gave me anointing oil.
    <br>When I went to meet the spiritualist, he gave me anointing oil
    <br>to keep in my house and rub on my body.
    <br>I have been rubbing that anointing oil on myself.
    <br>How long have you been rubbing the anointing oil?
    <br>I have been rubbing it on myself for about one month now.
    <br>Even he has used the oil to rub himself.
    <br>They used your picture.
    <br>You said it now!
    <br>You told me this morning; you confessed everything to me.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>She went with my picture and olive oil.
    <br>Yesterday night, she confessed to me.
    <br>She told me that she didn't go to a witch doctor's place.
    <br>She said she went to a pastor and I asked her how she knew the pastor.
    <br>Look, listen.
    <br>When I called you out yesterday, I mentioned my sister
    <br>because I saw your picture - they are applying that on your picture.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Man of God, the spiritualist I went to said that I should bring mine, my husband's and my children's pictures.
    <br>That is what I am saying. Don't worry.
    <br>But for your information, you too - you are not out of this thing.
    <br>Spiritualists - you too patronised spiritualists in the past.
    <br>He brought a spiritualist to the house recently.
    <br>That one told me that I should not fly abroad.
    <br>Throughout any season, I should not fly abroad as he was a prophet of God.
    <br>The man then told me that my family wanted to kill me and I should not fly abroad.
    <br>Okay. It is alright.
    <br>Madam, can I ask a question?
    <br>Whatever your husband says, I want to ask you a question, for the sake of your children.
    <br>Do you still love this man?
    <br>Yes, I love my husband very much; I don't want to have a broken home.
    <br>Thank you. Come.
    <br>Apart from being arrogant, you mentioned that your wife is very arrogant and not accessible.
    <br>When we remove that character out of your wife, do you love your wife?
    <br>I don't have a problem.
    <br>- No.
    <br>- I love her.
    <br>If you remove all those characters, I love her; I don't have a problem with her.
    <br>Is it so much?
    <br>Yes. I bought her a car; I am using public transport.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>Man of God, I didn't have a problem in my marriage until 2010.
    <br>I am not a very stubborn person.
    <br>My husband does not listen to advice.
    <br>Listen, you cannot see yourself.
    <br>Man of God, the problem we have in our marriage is this woman.
    <br>No. Wait.
    <br>You know, your husband has said it already.
    <br>He has judged himself.
    <br>He said that you are legal and the other one is not legal. What else again? In what language do you want to hear it?
    <br>He has judged himself already.
    <br>I am happy that you say you love this man, your husband.
    <br>And your husband too, loves you.
    <br>It is only this character. Agree?
    <br>Yes and she wants to kill somebody because of me.
    <br>She is threatening that woman and I don't want it.
    <br>She is always threatening this woman.
    <br>Wait.
    <br>How can legal and illegal live together? No. That is the problem. Wait.
    <br>You are saying legal and illegal. Unless they are legal.
    <br>And you know what the Bible says; the position of the Bible.
    <br>- You are a Christian?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Thank you. I don't want to begin to tell you what the Bible says.
    <br>But, what I am here for now is to meet you people, and I am going to meet my sister over there.
    <br>I can't ask her anything because this is the matter on the ground.
    <br>I am going to meet her, pray with her and deliver her.
    <br>In the same way you will discover yourself, she will discover herself.
    <br>My sister too will discover herself and she will do the right thing.
    <br>You will discover yourself and do the right thing.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>When deliverance comes upon a person,
    <br>you will discover yourself - your real value - and you will begin to do the right thing.
    <br>But the right thing is not from your mouth, but from the mouth of God.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>MARRIAGE COUNSELLING with T.B. JOSHUA!
    <br>It will come just like that from the heart.
    <br>I want to say a big thank you once again to my sister here, and also to my sister over there.
    <br>But I want to assure you that the Bible is our standard and what does the Bible say about this issue.
    <br>This is what we are going to do; we cannot do anything outside the Bible.
    <br>No one is above mistake.
    <br>The mistake has come. We are to correct it.
    <br>Out of character - my sister misbehaved, and my brother here too - out of character. I will say this.
    <br>Because no matter what happens, no matter what comes, you have to stand with our belief, our faith.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>Thank you. Go and wait. Thank you.
