  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>You see me every day, and still, each time you see me, you start screaming.
    <br>I am supposed to scream too because I usually see you occasionally...
    <br>Not all the time I used to see you...
    <br>But you see me every day - every time you see me, you still scream...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What will I believe now? Will I believe this screaming?
    <br>Will I believe all this screaming and close my eyes? - I have to open one eye.
    <br>This your screaming every day!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I understand. You are inspired.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>You are inspired.
    <br>I know that when one is inspired, you just see him laughing whereas there is nothing to laugh about.
    <br>Happy Mother's Day!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I thank God that I am not alone here.
    <br>If I was alone, I would feel shy.
    <br>I am not alone; I am in the midst of millions of people.
    <br>Can you see any one of them?
    <br>There are millions of people here. I'm not alone. That is why when you scream, I'm not moved.
    <br>Hallelujah. I was dancing and rejoicing with you. I watched testimonies.
    <br>It got to a stage when the Lord said, "Go out, it is time for you to attend to the people".
    <br>I said, "Lord, thank You".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do we still have anyone that is going through satan's torture?
    <br>Satan tortures people with worry about now and the future.
    <br>When you are under that, you are under torture.
    <br>You understand what I´m saying? You may not know what I am talking about when I say,
    <br>"Do we have anyone that is going through satan's torture?"
    <br>That is when you begin to think, "I'm worried";
    <br>"Will I be healed?"; "How will I pay that debt?";
    <br>"When are we leaving here? I think I will not miss my flight."
    <br>So anxious and desperate.
    <br>A lot of people have been dancing.
    <br>You look around and see some of your neighbours - they refused to dance
    <br>because maybe, they are waiting for their testimony.
    <br>They say, "Until I have my testimony, I will not dance".
    <br>If you are waiting for your own testimony, definitely, that testimony may never come
    <br>because the pain of one is the pain of all, and the joy of one is the joy of all. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The pain of one is the pain of all, and the joy of one is the joy of all.
    <br>I can´t hear you.
    <br>The pain of one is the pain of all, and the joy of one is the joy of all.
    <br>As a Christian, when you see your neighbour happy, join them.
    <br>You don't need to wait until you are happy.
    <br>You say, "They are giving testimony - until it happens to me!"
    <br>Some people just believe that, "Something must happen to me. If it has happened to me, it has happened.
    <br>If it has not happened to me, it has not happened".
    <br>They say, "Oh no, testimony. I am waiting for my own testimony".
    <br>That is not a good language for Christians.
    <br>The question I am even asking is, "Are you going through satan's torture?
    <br>So anxious, sad, depressed, worried about now and the future?"
    <br>"How will I be healed? I mean, I´m owing debt."
    <br>"My marriage, my health, my career!" - so anxious.
    <br>In the book of  Matthew 4:2, our Saviour, after 40 days and 40 nights,
    <br>He was hungry but not desperate.
    <br>No, he was very, very hungry.
    <br>Very, very hungry, after 40 days, 40 nights, but  not desperate, not anxious.
    <br>Because He was not anxious, that is why He did not fall into satan's trap.
    <br>Jesus did not fall into satan's trap because He was not what? - He was not desperate.
    <br>But today, many...
    <br>When you act so desperate, you will not mind where solution comes from.
    <br>When you are desperate, you will not mind God's time and God's time is the best.
    <br>"No, I just need it now. I'm so and so. I´m looking for a job. No, I don´t mind."
    <br>- when you are desperate, anxious.
    <br>Are you going through that?
    <br>God's time is the best. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>I can´t hear you.
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>At God's time, things look beautiful.
    <br>The right time.
    <br>When you receive something at God's time, it lasts forever.
    <br>What you need most, it´s there.
    <br>Don't be desperate. Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Don't be desperate.
    <br>I can´t hear you...
    <br>Don't be desperate.
    <br>The language of people that are desperate is, "I'm waiting for my testimony".
    <br>When they see people rejoice, they look to the other side.
    <br>They look to the other side, when they see people in church.
    <br>"Oh, why are you dancing?"
    <br>"Oh, testimony. I too have the same issue. I´m waiting for my own testimony."
    <br>That is when you´ll be happy.
    <br>Oh.
    <br>You have to rejoice with those who rejoice.
    <br>If not, your day of joy may never what? - May never come.
    <br>Each message is life-changing.
    <br>I am happy because you are  happy..
    <br>Are you not happy?
    <br>Because I´m seeing you happy.  You say what?
    <br>You're happy. You should not wait until it has happened to you, okay?
    <br>When you see your colleagues happy because of what God has done,
    <br>that is testimony for you.
    <br>What happens to your colleague is meant to build your faith.
    <br>What happened to me is meant to build your faith
    <br>and what happened to you is also meant to build my faith.
    <br>God is great!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We want to go to the sick ones.
    <br>Each issue brings revelation.
    <br>And as we share it together, we learn.
    <br>Like I have said, what will happen to anyone here is meant to build your faith;
    <br>it enhances your faith.
    <br>So when people say, "Thank You Jesus!",
    <br>you are looking to see what happened to the person before you say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>That is why you say:  "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>When you now see what happens, you say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>It is time to attend to them.
    <br>Viewers at home, I know you will see acts of mercy of God today;
    <br>acts of healing of God - you will see them clearly, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is going on in your heart when you see people with bandages, braces, this and that?
    <br>I believe strongly that they have an appointment with God today and God is going to work.
    <br>Their pain is your pain.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When you see their pain, it is your pain.
    <br>So when we start praying, you join us in prayer as well.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I say, "Be healed!", your heart too should say, "Be healed!"
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>When the person is healed, it means your prayer and my prayer made it happen.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What does it mean to you when you see people with different gadgets?
    <br>Man of God, like you said, it means that man is born into trouble.
    <br>Man is born into trouble.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ah, I´m afraid of you!
    <br>This man! Your word is pregnant.
    <br>Let me ask again. I don't know what he wants to say again.
    <br>Man of God...
    <br>Ah! In each word, you keep saying "Man of God".
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Why can't you go straight to the point?
    <br>You said, "Man of God, man is born into trouble".  Am I the one that born you into trouble?
    <br>Man of God, that is why you are sent to us
    <br>because Christ is in you and you are in Christ.
    <br>But you too. You are sent to me.
    <br>Man of God, each time I see you, I see Christ in you.
    <br>Each time I see you, I see Christ with a crown.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My brother, you have said it all. He said, "Man is born into trouble".
    <br>Each time you are facing challenges, you should know it is a way of life.
    <br>Stop saying "witches and wizards" instead of facing it.
    <br>Man is born into trouble.
    <br>Thank you very much. Clap for him.
    <br>So sister, how does the whole thing appeal to you?
    <br>Like their pain is my pain.
    <br>I should put myself in their position.
    <br>Put yourself in their position.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When it is time for prayer, what is your position?
    <br>To pray for them too.
    <br>You pray; you join us in prayer.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>When the miracle happens, you know your prayer has been answered.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Viewers at home, join me in prayer.
    <br>So when I stretch my hand, if you cannot stretch your hand, stretch your heart.
    <br>When I say, "In Jesus' name!", you too say after me, "In Jesus' name!"
    <br>And when the miracle happens, it happens because two believers are better than one.
    <br>Man of God, I experience difficulty in walking due to degeneration of disc disease.
    <br>I´m using a lumbar corset and lumbar body support to help me suppress the pain.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So you use a lot of tablets.
    <br>To suppress the pain.
    <br>So it is time to pray, ok?
    <br>So this is a Spirit prayer.
    <br>Prayer in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Be delivered, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Healing in Jesus' Name

    <br>I have shortness of breath.
    <br>I have been using a breathing machine to assist me with my breathing for two years now.
    <br>From where?
    <br>I´m from South Africa.
    <br>What is this?
    <br>It's an oxygen machine.

    <br>Healed Of Anus Cancer In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can sit now!
    <br>Yes, he can sit now!
    <br>I can sit! Now I can sit!
    <br>Healed Of Anus Cancer In Jesus' Name
    <br>Ok. To God be the glory! This is a brother who had the problem of anus cancer.
    <br>The doctors condemned my anus and on Thursday I was supposed to go for the third operation.
    <br>They said it was cancer of the anus and they would open part of my belly,
    <br>where I would be passing out my faeces a lifetime.
    <br>So, I left the hospital on Wednesday. From Bayelsa, I had to come to Lagos.
    <br>What happened to you now that caused this amazement? You're so surprised.
    <br>After the prayers, I am healed; I can sit now.
    <br>What about the pain?
    <br>The pain - it's gone!
    <br>Can you sit now? Sit and tell us...
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>We thank God for His goodness in the life of the young man here.
    <br>You heard him. He said he has undergone two major operations
    <br>and he was booked for a third operation, before he proceeded on the journey to The SCOAN.
    <br>He said he could not sit at all for the past one year.
    <br>But after the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, touched him, he said the pain is gone.
    <br>For the first time in one year, he is sitting now, to the glory of God.
    <br>God of T.B. Joshua, thank You!
    <br>You heard this man saying that he had not slept for one year. See him sleeping.
    <br>That is to show that he received a touch of God, in Jesus' name.
