  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>I want to believe that you have realised that God is reliable.
    <br>[Yes]
    <br>If God is reliable, you put your trust in Him.
    <br>How do we put our trust in God?
    <br>By using our faith to put a demand.
    <br>You can’t just say, “I trust God because I've seen so much. I have seen He is not a man”.
    <br>You can’t come to the issue of trust without using your faith to put a demand on the anointing.
    <br>Anointing is the power of God.
    <br>When you see God, you see power.
    <br>When God smiles, power smiles.
    <br>When God looks, power looks.
    <br>When God moves, power moves. 
    <br>That is God!
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>God is honest, reliable, trustworthy and stable.
    <br>Therefore, what is lacking is not greater faith but a greater God.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>“What is lacking is not greater faith but a greater God, big God – G O D.”
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you have realised that God is honest, based on you have seen - what else again?
    <br>God is honest, stable, trustworthy and reliable.
    <br>Therefore, what is lacking is not greater faith,
    <br>because you demand greater faith - no,
    <br>but a greater God.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you are at home.
    <br>When I say "at home" I mean in Him.
    <br>Your home is not here.
    <br>This reminds me of the woman with the issue of blood.
    <br>She believed enough.
    <br>You say, "I believe".
    <br>What do you mean by "believe"?
    <br>You believe enough.
    <br>She believed enough and pressed through the crowd to touch Jesus.
    <br>There was so much crowd. "How would I go? I don't want to push. I'm not strong".
    <br>But she believed enough to press through crowd to touch who?
    <br>To touch who?
    <br>To touch Jesus.
    <br>Press in to touch Jesus.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Press in to touch Jesus."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Press in to touch Jesus.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Press in to touch Jesus.]
    <br>Press in to touch Jesus to heal and deliver you.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Press in to touch Jesus to heal and deliver you.]
    <br>Say, “I press in to touch Him. Oh, Lord Jesus, heal me!”
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, what is good her is good for you.
    <br>The Bible says that she believed enough – not just believed – she believed enough to press in.
    <br>There was so much crowd, not only crowd - hindrance, obstacle...
    <br>If it was a gentle crowd... but this one the Bible called a throng.
    <br>There was so much noise; you could see a thug, you could see a street boy.
    <br>A lot of them were following Jesus...
    <br>The Bible says that she believed enough to press through; through what?
    <br>Crowd.
    <br>To touch Jesus.
    <br>You must press in to touch Him to heal you.
    <br>Say, “I believe”.
    <br>[I believe.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[I believe.]
    <br>You must believe enough.
    <br>I press in to touch You, oh Lord; heal me.
    <br>Say after me, "I press in to touch You."
    <br>Write it down - that should be your prayer point today.
    <br>I press in to touch You, oh Lord Jesus; heal, deliver and bless me.
    <br>Let Your seraphim touch me.
    <br>I press it to touch You, oh Lord; heal me.
    <br>Let Your seraphim touch me.
    <br>It is Jesus
    <br>Yes it is Jesus
    <br>It is Jesus
    <br>In my soul
    <br>For I have touched
    <br>The hem of His garment
    <br>And His blood
    <br>Has made me whole
    <br>Your voice.
    <br>It is Jesus
    <br>Yes it is Jesus
    <br>It is Jesus
    <br>In my soul
    <br>For I have touched
    <br>The hem of His garment
    <br>And His blood
    <br>Has made me whole
    <br>It is Jesus
    <br>Yes it is Jesus
    <br>It is Jesus
    <br>In my soul
    <br>For I have touched
    <br>The hem of His garment
    <br>And His blood
    <br>Has made me whole
    <br>I press in to touch You; Jesus, heal me.
    <br>I press in to touch You; Jesus, deliver me.
    <br>I press in to touch You; Jesus, bless me.
    <br>Let Your seraphim touch me, in Jesus’ name.
    <br>Be ready for a touch.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>[Yes.]
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>What is your name?
    <br>My name is Favour Okere.
    <br>Good. What happened?
    <br>I have the problem of scoliosis of my spine.
    <br>My spine is curved; and I am sure that God will help me.
    <br>Remove the world "sure".
    <br>OK?
    <br>Say, "I believe."
    <br>I believe.
    <br>I believe that God will heal me.
    <br>You say after me, "I press in to touch Him, oh Lord, heal me."
    <br>Stretch your hand.
    <br>I press in to touch Him, oh Lord, heal me.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Remove it.
    <br>Let her remove it by herself.
    <br>Touch your body again.
    <br>I press in to touch You...
    <br>That "You" is Jesus, OK?
    <br>"I press in to touch You, oh Lord, heal me."
    <br>Amen.
    <br>You can go.
    <br>Healed In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Yes, this is exactly what the woman with the issue of blood said.
    <br>Jesus said, “Somebody touched Me, ...
    <br>Let someone say it.
    <br>[Somebody touched me!]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Somebody touched me!]
    <br>... for I perceive power has gone out from Me”.
    <br>Let somebody say, "Somebody touched Me".
    <br>I cannot hear you!
    <br>[Somebody touched me!]
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Yes. When the woman said, "I press in touch you, oh Lord, heal me",
    <br>immediately Jesus said, "Somebody touched me".
    <br>Please man of God help me.
    <br>I have a stiff neck due to spondylolysis
    <br>I have been booked for an operation.
    <br>I also have spinal cord stenosis.
    <br>The doctor said that if I am not operated on time it would affect my spinal cord and I become parallelized.
    <br>Help me man of God.
    <br>Please man of God help my husband.
    <br>He has been booked for an operation.
    <br>He has stiff neck and stenosis of the spinal cord.
    <br>OK. Come on.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Listen to your little one.
    <br>OK. Say, "I press in to touch You, oh Lord, heal me."
    <br>I press in to touch You, oh Lord, heal me.
    <br>Healed In Jesus’ Name
    <br>I press in to touch You, oh Lord, heal me.
    <br>Somebody touched Me, for I perceive power has gone out from Me.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I am healed.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I can now turn my head.
    <br>I can now bend forward and backward.
    <br>What are we learning?
    <br>Faith – your faith is growing.
    <br>You are now seeing that Jesus is reliable.
    <br>Man of God, I have a dislocation of the elbow joint due to accident...
    <br>Where were you going?
    <br>I was at work.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>You listened to the message?
    <br>Yes, Sir.
    <br>What the messages is all about?
    <br>It is about pressing on to hold on to my faith.
    <br>You are pressing in this time, not on.
    <br>You have to press in, because the situation is tough, because your faith is not strong.
    <br>You cannot press on.
    <br>I press in.
    <br>I press in to hold on to faith.
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>OK, remove it - you are free.
    <br>Come on, you can go.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Man of God, I have spondylolysis.
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Look here!
    <br>You can go.
    <br>Turn your neck, you are free.
    <br>Healed In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I am suffering from lumbar scoliosis.
    <br>You say what?
    <br>I am suffering from lumbar spondylolysis.
    <br>I thought that I am the only person that doesn't know how to spell it - that...
    <br>I have a colleague now.
    <br>This spondylolysis - I have looked at it in my dictionary "to get it easy".
    <br>It is very difficult for me.
    <br>But now I find someone who is my partner :)
    <br>How do you call it?
    <br>Spondulosis.
    <br>Lumbar ?spondulosis?
    <br>?Cororosis?
    <br>:)
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>You are my partner.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>OK, it's all right.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>OK, It's all right.
    <br>Come on.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>OK, it's all right. Stand up.
    <br>Healed In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Man of God, help my mother.
    <br>She is having difficulties in walking.
    <br>OK, it's all right. Come on!
    <br>Healing In Jesus’ Name
    <br>Look here!
    <br>It's all right.
    <br>Stand. 
    <br>Remove this from...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus for healing my mother.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Let someone say, “I press in to touch You, oh Lord; free me.”
    <br>Somebody touched Me, for I perceive power has gone out from Me.
    <br>Yes, He senses power.
    <br>Somebody touched Me
    <br>Somebody touched Me
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>When I was praying
    <br>Praying to my Father
    <br>Somebody touched my soul
    <br>It must be Jesus
    <br>It must be Jesus
    <br>Jesus Christ touched my soul
    <br>When I was praying
    <br>Praying to my Father
    <br>Jesus Christ touched my soul
    <br>Somebody touched Me,
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Somebody touched Me
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Somebody touched Me, for I perceive power has gone out from Me.
    <br>Somebody touched Me!
    <br>Who?
    <br>Me.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>It is time now to continue your mediation in your heart.
    <br>What are you meditating?
    <br>Lord Jesus, make me Your channel – a channel of pardon.
    <br>Make me Your channel – a channel of forgiveness.
    <br>Make me You channel – a channel of purity, oh, Lord Jesus.
    <br>Simple - those are the things you should meditate on.
    <br>You may be seated while your meditation goes on.
    <br>That is the only way you can be delivered.
    <br>The kind of prayer you offer nowadays cannot help you.
    <br>You are used to...
    <br>All those things cannot help you.
    <br>If this thing could help you, it would have helped you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If this prayer could help you, it would have helped you".
    <br>You know, you have been in it...
    <br>This can not help you.
    <br>You need meditation to get out of this mess.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You need meditation to get out of this mess."
    <br>If Jesus is Spirit you need to begin to make that noise.
    <br>But you shout "Jesus" not in church but at home, as He were your neighbour.
    <br>Those things are hypocritical.
    <br>People choose to be religious, from where we all came from.
    <br>We were religious men, before we turned to Christianity.
    <br>Today, people are going back to their religious systems.
    <br>There is hypocrisy in it.
    <br>There is no unity, envy jealousy among the churches,
    <br>"This one is devil.
    <br>This one is satan."
    <br>Who is now a child of God?
    <br>The devil and satan now turned to be a child of God.
    <br>There is so much hypocrisy, disunity...
    <br>Meditation is a visit with God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Meditation is a visit with God.]
    <br>This is why the Bible says, “Pray without ceasing”.
    <br>Prayer is a thing of the heart, not a thing of the body.
    <br>Today's prayer becomes the thing of the body, but it is a thing of a heart.
    <br>I can be talking to you now, but I am praying at the same time.
    <br>How this is possible?
    <br>I'm talking to you and at the same time I'm praying.
    <br>It is possible because a prayer is the thing of the heart.
    <br>Our heart can do 10 things at the same time – it is a place of God, it is a place of meditation,
    <br>it is a place of communion.
    <br>it is a place of holiness,
    <br>it is a place of direction,
    <br>it is a place of ministry – that is heart.
    <br>If you say you must shout when you pray, how do you pray when you sleep?
    <br>And you are also supposed to pray while you are sleeping.
    <br>The way blood runs in our system is the way prayer should also run.
    <br>It is an integral part.
    <br>It is an article of faith.
    <br>These are the things you need to break through.
    <br>You need to get this right to be saved.
    <br>If not, satan knows when you are not praying and he will catch you.
    <br>He will never catch you while you are praying;
    <br>he knows you do not pray all the time, you have a time for prayer.
    <br>Those times you are not praying, he normally catches you.
    <br>When you look at the problems you had, they were at times you were not praying.
    <br>You say, "I am going to pray."
    <br>Before you get there satan catches you.
    <br>Satan knows those things and he had been catching you like that.
    <br>This is why 90% of attacks today are in the dream.
    <br>Because he know that you are empty while you are sleeping.
    <br>When they attack you in the dream, the thing will manifest in the real life.
    <br>When one was attacked yesterday night, the thing will start manifesting today.
    <br>If it was a gun shoot, it will start manifesting and it will happen in one of the following days.
    <br>It might have been a food given to you in the dream; when you wake up the thing will begin to manifest.
    <br>Something like that ... definitely.
    <br>They decided to attack you in the dream because they know you do not have the power of meditation.
    <br>When you meditate, you meditate throughout and when you sleep, meditation continues
    <br>because it is a power of God; it is not your power.
    <br>This prayer you offer today is your own power, not God's power.
    <br>Therefore, you can not operate in the dream.
    <br>When you meditate and finally sleep, the meditation will continue
    <br>because it is your heart that is doing it.
    <br>Your heart will never cease while sleeping.
    <br>Your heart functions while you are sleeping and the same heart is the one of mediation.
    <br>Your body ceases immediately when you sleep but the heart continues.
    <br>Meditation is of heart.
    <br>That meditation will become revelation that manifests through your life.
    <br>Where there is darkness, and you ask God to make you a channel of light - there is an attack from darkness
    <br>- you just see a manifestation of it because you are a channel of light to God.
    <br>Heart needs to be delivered to meditate.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Heart needs to be delivered to meditate.]
    <br>To meditate.
    <br>Heart that is H E A R T.
    <br>Heart means your spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Heart means your spirit.]
    <br>When I say heart I mean your spirit.
    <br>Man's spirit means heart.
    <br>Your heart needs to be delivered to meditate because a lot of things are going on in your heart.
    <br>To receive is very simple – healing and deliverance are on your table already;
    <br>how will you maintain them?
    <br>You can not maintain even your life, your hair, your dress, your suit - you can not maintain.
    <br>You cannot even maintain your home.
    <br>You cannot maintain children given to you by God.
    <br>You cannot maintain your husband or your wife.
    <br>You cannot maintain the car you have.
    <br>Not to mention heavenly resources.
    <br>You cannot maintain your business, salary, the money you receive.
    <br>Even your shoes - you cannot maintain them.
    <br>It is better not to receive than to receive without what?
    <br>[Maintenance.]
    <br>It is better not to...
    <br>If I want to give you this.
    <br>If you know you cannot maintain it - don't receive it.
    <br>You can only receive it when you know you can maintain it
    <br>because you will need it more dearly tomorrow, not today.
    <br>What you are about receive today, you will need so dearly tomorrow.
    <br>Today you need healing - it is true, you need healing.
    <br>But you need a better one tomorrow.
    <br>If you now lose it at the time you need it most - what is the use of it?
    <br>That is why we are talking of maintenance.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Meditation is a tool you can use to receive from God.
    <br>Meditation is a tool you can use to receive from Heavenly Father.
    <br>What are we meditating on?
    <br>The word of God.
    <br>If anyone tells you that you can meditate without heart, that is not meditation; it is thinking.
    <br>Thinking is in lower-house, meditation is upper-house – heart.
    <br>Thinking is a sitting room, meditation is a bed room.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I were just a visitor, you would not allow me to enter your bed room.
    <br>You will receive me in your sitting room, entertain me and do whatever you want to do and discharge me.
    <br>But I must be a part of the house before I can enter your bed room.
    <br>Meditation is a bed room, thinking is a sitting room.
    <br>This is why we say the Word must be an integral part of you – live in you, dominate you, rule you.
    <br>When you are delivered, your heart will be free.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Meditation can only work when you have a free spirit – free heart.
    <br>A free heart meditates.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[A free heart meditates.]
    <br>A free spirit meditates.
    <br>[A free spirit meditates.]
    <br>You think, "How will I solve my problem? I own a debt. I'm tired of this world.
    <br>All my family - we are poor."
    <br>All this thinking...
    <br>You need to leave all this for God.
    <br>When you leave it for God, He is able; you can meditate with your heart.
    <br>This is what I mean by self-will.
    <br>Self-will around your heart will never allow your heart to meditate.
    <br>We meditate in the power of God when our heart is free.
    <br>And one’s heart can be free when we are delivered.
