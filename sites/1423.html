    <br>Greet your neighbour, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Greet your neighbour with joy, "Emmanuel!"
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You just watched the testimonies - Jesus is alive.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, welcome to His presence".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, welcome to the presence of Jesus".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, today, the history of your life will be rewritten".
    <br>No matter what you are going through, today is solution.
    <br>Testimony!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, you may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>We need to know God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, we need to know God".
    <br>Today, brothers and sisters,
    <br>our colleges, schools and technical institutions are busy moulding the mind, the intellect.
    <br>All the knowledge we have is from the senses.
    <br>Remember what Jesus said to the teachers and doctors of the law in the Book of John 5:39:
    <br>You search the Scriptures because you believe you have eternal life in them.
    <br>But these Scriptures are the ones that testify about me
    <br>and you are not willing to come to me to receive life, eternal life.
    <br>Brethren, this clearly indicates that one can be sound in doctrine and be lost.
    <br>We don't know God by outward things - externals.
    <br>Many people know about God but they do not know God.
    <br>There is a difference between knowing facts about God and knowing God.
    <br>Knowing facts about Jesus cannot change your relationship with Him.
    <br>Remember, Jesus has come to change your life. He is ready to do it now.
    <br>The right knowledge of God settles peace.
    <br>This brings us to our message this morning: KNOW GOD BETTER.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, you need to know God better".
    <br>Again.
    <br>[You need to know God better.]
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Let us go to our Bibles: the Book of John 4.
    <br>I read:
    <br>"Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming
    <br>when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.
    <br>You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.
    <br>But the hour is coming, and now is,
    <br>when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth;
    <br>for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.
    <br>God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.'"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, know God better".
    <br>There is need to know God better.
    <br>Today, brethren, when you look around Christendom, you will see in the church today,
    <br>there is an erroneous assumption that spiritual truth can be intellectually perceived.
    <br>The Bible says we live by faith.
    <br>Faith is not a product of the reasoning faculties but of the recreated spirit.
    <br>1 Corinthians 2:14 says the natural man - the man of the mind of intellect -
    <br>cannot understand or receive the things of the Spirit of God.
    <br>In other words, faith is not a natural thing to be discussed intellectually
    <br>but faith needs to be discerned and operated spiritually.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, faith is not a product of the reasoning faculties".
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua says that the heart is the man himself - your real self,
    <br>the seat of wisdom, knowledge, understanding, moral character
    <br>and it is the fountain of all you do.
    <br>This means, until today's church realises that man's spirit, man's heart is the fountain of faith,
    <br>that is when the Spirit of God will begin to intervene in our affairs.
    <br>The man of God truly says that the real thing of man is his spirit.
    <br>Say, "The real thing of me is my spirit; the rest is a camouflage".
    <br>The real thing of you is your spirit; the rest is a camouflage.
    <br>We need to get into the heart of the matter because packaging is deceptive.
    <br>Patience reveals the true picture.
    <br>Who is a real man of God?
    <br>Who is a Christian? Who knows God?
    <br>Let someone say, "God is Spirit".
    <br>Those who worship Him must do so in spirit and in truth.
    <br>The question is: Who is a real Christian?
    <br>The Scripture says by their fruit, you shall know them.
    <br>In other words, God has given us His Spirit to make us like His Son, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Say, "I am made to be like Jesus in my heart".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, you are made to be like Jesus in your heart".
    <br>When the Holy Spirit dwells in our hearts, when He takes up residence within us,
    <br>He does so with the aim of helping us to develop a holy character.
    <br>Let someone say, "Godly character. A holy character".
    <br>This means, a Christian must not only know His God but show His God.
    <br>A Christian must not only know his faith but show his faith.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, mirror Jesus".
    <br>How do we mirror Jesus?
    <br>We mirror Jesus when we possess His character.
    <br>A child of God must bear the image of the Heavenly Father by being good and doing good.
    <br>The words we speak, the conversations we have with other people,
    <br>the sermons we preach are all treasures, gifts we are endowed with.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, mirror Jesus".
    <br>How do we possess His character?
    <br>Many confess Jesus by words and deny Him in action.
    <br>How do we possess His character?
    <br>The Scripture says that God's Word reflects His character.
    <br>Let someone say, "God's Word reflects His character".
    <br>My words reflect my character.
    <br>This means, only our character can testify to our confession of Jesus.
    <br>Let the beauty of Christ be evident and seen in you, in your utterances and in your deeds.
    <br>The Word of God reveals what is in our hearts.
    <br>Say, "The Word of God reveals what is in my heart".
    <br>The Word is God building Himself into me
    <br>as His Word rules, dominates and sanctifies our spirit nature.
    <br>Neighbour, be an imitator of Christ.
    <br>To be like Jesus, we must live like Him.
    <br>You must speak, talk, act as if Jesus is the one acting, speaking and talking.
    <br>When we examine the life of Jesus in the light of the Scriptures,
    <br>you will know that Jesus knew what He was all about.
    <br>Let someone say, "Jesus knew what He was all about".
    <br>Jesus Christ knew whom He was and what He was all about.
    <br>Jesus knew His mission and His mission is salvation.
    <br>His mission is to come to deliver the captive and heal the sick.
    <br>That's why He rightfully says, "I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.
    <br>No one comes to the Father, except through Me".
    <br>Jesus believed His product.
    <br>Jesus' product is so dear, unique; people could not do without it.
    <br>People came from far looking for Jesus.
    <br>Nicodemus ran to Jesus.
    <br>What is Jesus' product?
    <br>Life to people - abundant life to you.
    <br>No matter what you have been through,
    <br>today, turn your heart to Jesus and abundant life will flow in your life -
    <br>abundant life in your spirit, in your soul and in your body.
    <br>God says, 'I will turn the wilderness to a pool of living waters'.
    <br>Jesus turns darkness to light, sickness to good health.
    <br>No one is hopeless whose hope is in Jesus.
    <br>Now, let me ask you this question: Where is Jesus?
    <br>Ask your neighbour. Say, "Neighbour, where is Jesus?"
    <br>Hebrews 7:25 and Hebrews 8:1 say that Jesus is presently sitting at the right hand of God,
    <br>interceding for you and me.
    <br>Jesus is sitting next to the Father, telling Him about you, about me, about your needs.
    <br>Say, "Jesus has all my needs".
    <br>This is good news. Do you believe that?
    <br>Jesus knew whom He was.
    <br>Jesus believed in Himself; His belief was from Heaven.
    <br>That is why what the Phrarisees and Sadducees said about Him
    <br>could not change His opinion about Himself; that could not change His direction.
    <br>The question I'm asking you today:
    <br>Do you believe what God says about you?
    <br>Do you know God's opinion about yourself and others?
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, do you believe in God's ability?"
    <br>Do you believe in yourself?
    <br>To believe in yourself is to believe what God says about you - your divine cause and course in life.
    <br>If your situation says you are barren and Jesus says you are fruitful, Jesus prevails.
    <br>If natural circumstances tell you now that there is no way,
    <br>Jesus makes a way where there is no way.
    <br>What people say about you does not matter; what matters is what you believe.
    <br>I don't know what situation you are going through today.
    <br>But if you know that Jesus is alive,
    <br>the Book of Daniel 11:32 says, 'Those who know their God will be strong and do mighty works.'
    <br>Do you know your God?
    <br>Do you know what God says about you?
    <br>Do you know what Jesus is seeing when He is looking at you?
    <br>Let someone say, "The Lord has the final word".
    <br>Say, "Jesus has the final word".
    <br>Say, "The right knowledge of God Almighty settles peace".
    <br>Today, peace is in your home.
    <br>Say, "Peace in my home.
    <br>Peace in my family.
    <br>Peace in my business".
    <br>Remember, there was a man called Zacchaeus.
    <br>Jesus came to Jericho purposefully to visit that man and salvation came into his home.
    <br>Remember the man who was afflicted for 38 years at the Pool of Bethesda, hopeless -
    <br>Jesus came and set him free.
    <br>He knows your mind.
    <br>He knows your heart.
    <br>He knows what you are going through.
    <br>That is why the Bible says, "Without vision, people perish".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, I know that my God is alive".
    <br>No situation is bigger than my God.
    <br>My situation, trouble does not embarass Jesus because He has the solution.
    <br>Brethren, many have accepted Jesus as their Lord and Saviour
    <br>without being fully aware of its implications.
    <br>Anything close to Jesus receives attack.
    <br>But fear not, Jesus is in control.
    <br>Jesus was rejected in His home town.
    <br>Jesus was falsely accused being called a devil, but Jesus, the Lord, never spent time on His critics.
    <br>He continued to cast out devils and to fulfill the will of the Father.
    <br>Daniel was falsely accused of breaking the law of the land.
    <br>Joseph was accused of raping his employer's wife.
    <br>What is your situation today?
    <br>What is giving you pressure and tension?
    <br>What is challenging your faith in a unique way today?
    <br>Don't allow it to cause you to doubt the goodness of God because Jesus has the final word.
    <br>Let someone say, "Jesus has the final word".
    <br>Sometimes in life, we may find ourselves unduly hated and persecuted
    <br>because of the grace of God in our lives,
    <br>especially when they cannot figure out the source, the foundation of our integrity.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, integrity cannot be proven, it can only be discerned".
    <br>If people speak evil against you,
    <br>if people do evil against you, know that they do that because of ignorance and fear.
    <br>The man of God says, this is the key of life to you and me.
    <br>Integrity cannot be proven, it can only be discerned.
    <br>This means, leave the battle for God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the race to survival is not my personal challenge, but one with the Lord".
    <br>Say, "I am walking with the Lord".
    <br>Declare that with faith, "I'm walking with Jesus".
    <br>What is seen, what is on the outside, cannot dictate my direction.
    <br>Can sickness?
    <br>Can disease?
    <br>Can trouble?
    <br>Who has the final word?
    <br>It means, you are victorious.
    <br>Give thanks to Jesus for that.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you know God's opinion about yourself, your marriage, your business,
    <br>you will never be moved by the happenings around you.
    <br>When you know what God says about you,
    <br>that will impart a strength to endure whatever situation you face.
    <br>That situation is just for a moment.
    <br>Let someone say, "My situation is just for a moment".
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>My God is aware.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, this is the way out: Know God better".
    <br>Know Jesus better.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Any moment from now, we believe,
    <br>you will see that Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will see and discover that the voice of your situation will not prevail
    <br>but the voice of God will prevail.
    <br>God never promised to keep you and me away from trouble.
    <br>He never said we will be out of touch.
    <br>But Jesus said, "Take heart, I have overcome the world for you".
    <br>The key to victory is to know your God.
    <br>Knowing Jesus is not only to see the miracles but to learn His ways.
    <br>The man of God says, God can use foolish things to confuse us.
    <br>But today, you will know what God says about your situation.
    <br>Finally, brethren, the Bible says,
    <br>Jesus is the answer to the human dilemma.
    <br>Jesus is the answer to all fundamental issues of life.
    <br>Let someone say, "Jesus is the answer to all fundamental issues of life".
    <br>Jesus is the Light - the Light that will dispel every shade of darkness in your life.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>Begin to say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Jesus stood before Pilate and Pilate said to Him, "What is truth?"
    <br>To know God better, sense-knowledge must give way to Spiritual enlightenment.
    <br>When the eyes of your faith are open, you will see that God has the final word.
    <br>No one can know the things of God without the Spirit of God.
    <br>This means, the things of God no one knows, except by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>1 Corinthians 12:3 says you can only know Jesus
    <br>as far as the Holy Spirit is pleased to reveal Him to you.
    <br>Put your hand on your heart.
    <br>Say, "Lord, open my heart to Your Word.
    <br>Open my heart to Your Spirit.
    <br>Open my heart to Your faith.
    <br>Open my eyes to see what You are looking at.
    <br>Open my heart to hear what God says about my situation.
    <br>That is the key to victory.
    <br>Brethren, if Jesus Christ is to be the Christ of God, not the Christ of history,
    <br>if our faith is to be a New Testament faith and Jesus to be the Christ of God -
    <br>Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit, not the Jesus of history -
    <br>then the illumination of the Spirit will tell in your heart that you are learning at the feet of God.
    <br>Let someone say, "It's all about Jesus".
    <br>Christianity stands and falls on Jesus, on the illumination of the Spirit of Jesus.
    <br>To know the truth is to know Jesus.
    <br>When you know the truth about your situation, you will smile.
    <br>When you know God's opinion about your life, you will worry no more,
    <br>you will fear no more because God has spoken.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Let someone say, "There is need to know God better".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, there is need to know God better".
    <br>When the eyes of your faith are open to see God's glory and sovereignty,
    <br>you will no longer fear the calamities of life because Jesus is alive.
    <br>May God bless His Word, in Jesus' name.
