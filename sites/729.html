  <p>    
    <br>Let me wish you a Happy Wonderful Year.
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Happy Wonderful Year!
    <br>I call it a Wonderful Year because it is a wonderful year.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>This year is a wonderful year.
    <br>I know many nations have not entered the New Year.
    <br>But I want to tell you what you are about to enter
    <br>or what you have entered, is a wonderful one.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And those nations that have a different calendar - but in all, 2017 is a wonderful year!
    <br>It is so wonderful for you, people of God!
    <br>After going through the whole thing, the revelation and what we should be expecting in the year,
    <br>you will agree with me, so wonderful!
    <br>I don't know how to call it.
    <br>Will I call it New Year or New Beginning or whatever, but I chose the word wonderful
    <br>because it is so wonderful.
    <br>It demands 'trust and obey'.
    <br>The year demands 'trust and obey'.
    <br>That's why I said it is wonderful.
    <br>It is a wonderful year because of what it demands.
    <br>If you want to go through the year, enjoy the year, overcome and walk through it smoothly,
    <br>just trust and obey;
    <br>that is why I call it a wonderful year.
    <br>This year, we will experience challenges and some of these challenges are going to be unique.
    <br>When something is unique, there will be things that you will not know how to handle
    <br>because you have never gone through them before.
    <br>They are not things you can handle.
    <br>Things you can handle, when they come, you say, "Hey, yes, let me apply the former tactic, stragegy
    <br>I used in the past", but the one that is very unique, you will say,
    <br>"I don't know how to go about this; how will I do it, oh God".
    <br>A lot of these challenges will be very unique - different from what you know and are used to.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Remember that yesterday I told you that
    <br>no matter the challenges, they will not impair you but improve you - just trust and obey.
    <br>The reason why there will be so many challenges and unique ones is because there is a dream for you.
    <br>Today, take my word - you have a dream.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I have a dream".
    <br>A dream is something that you may not know but people can tell you, "You have a dream".
    <br>You say, "What is the dream?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This year will come with so many challenges and unique ones because you have a dream.
    <br>There is something the Lord said to me that I should tell you -
    <br>the voice of their wailing shall be silenced.
    <br>That is, tell your people - the voice of their wailing will be silent.
    <br>This means that God is there to intervene and to rescue you.
    <br>The outcome of this is a dream - dream of breakthrough -
    <br>the outcome of challenges.
    <br>You have nothing to worry about - just trust and obey.
    <br>The Lord says, "The voice of trouble shall be silenced".
    <br>What else again?
    <br>The voice of difficulty shall be silenced.
    <br>The voice of setback, hardship, just name them, shall be silenced.
    <br>It means these will come: You will only hear the crying but they will not reach you.
    <br>Voice means strength - their strength and ability to destroy and kill you will be combatted.
    <br>Just trust and obey.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Just trust and obey".
    <br>Those dreams you thought were lost, are not lost.
    <br>There are a lot of dreams you had in the past, and you keep asking yourself,
    <br>"I dreamt I gave handshake to this man 3 years ago, but I have never met the man till now".
    <br>There are a lot of questions you keep asking yourself but there is no one to answer.
    <br>Those dreams are not lost.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This year, dream of breakthrough - a new dream for you.
    <br>Write it down.
    <br>I'm just giving you the summary of what is here.
    <br>Dream of breakthrough - a new dream for you.
    <br>Just trust and obey.
    <br>Amidst trouble, in the midst of challenges, you will find yourself
    <br>but the Lord says, "The voice of challenges shall be silenced!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The outcome of the temptation and difficult circumstances you will be going through,
    <br>the outcome of the unique challenges you will be going through -
    <br>dream of breakthrough, a new dream for you.
    <br>Dream of prosperity - a new dream for you.
    <br>Are you writing it down?
    <br>These are the dreams you are supposed to have yourself.
    <br>But you could not, but I had the dream and I am now telling you what I dreamt about you.
    <br>If you now doubt my dream, definitely, then there is no cause for you to come here.
    <br>Can somebody come out and tell me what dream you had about yourself, concerning this new approach.
    <br>You are saying Happy New Year without dream, how come?
    <br>How do you know you are a in new beginning? Can somebody? How do you know?
    <br>Oh no, this is intellectual property anyway...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Is it a slogan? It's not a slogan, it has to do with your life.
    <br>If you say, "New Year, New beginning", you should believe -
    <br>your soul and spirit should believe it.
    <br>When your soul believes it, then, it will work for you.
    <br>It's not a slogan.
    <br>Talk to me.
    <br>How do you know you are in a New Beginning, in a New Year? Can somebody tell me?
    <br>Praise The Lord. You know that you are in a New Year when you have a change in mind, change of mind,
    <br>change of position, wanting to do things differently from how you used to do them before
    <br>and as soon as you have this feeling and you believe it, you begin to do things in that new way
    <br>and that makes you a new person and a new creature.
    <br>Not just change in calendar, but change in position and change in what you believe in - to a new thing.
    <br>Thank you. Can we believe that this is what you read, or this is what you believe.
    <br>I have never read it, but I believe it.
    <br>You believe it?
    <br>I believe it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ok, tells us those things that you have changed, to start the New Year?
    <br>Well, basically I am a business man and...
    <br>Ahhh...
    <br>Can you see where this man started from. Sit down, sit down.
    <br>I know, I know you people.
    <br>First, money.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You begin a new year when you finally discover that everything you don't want
    <br>and you don't like - unfavourable situations - end with the year.
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What are unfavourable situations that have ended with the year 2016?"
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "What are those unfavourable situations you have been in
    <br>that have ended with that year?"
    <br>Carry-over is not good.
    <br>You were fighting yesterday, you still wake up and the fight continues.
    <br>"Happy New Year 2017!" - the fight continues.
    <br>You have not begun a New Year. You're still in 2016.
    <br>Every unfavourable situation you have been in, must end with the outgoing year.
    <br>That is how we know.
    <br>The way you were thinking yesterday, is the same way you are thinking now;
    <br>the same way you approached things yesterday
    <br>is the same way you are approaching things now - what is new then?
    <br>The same anger, pain, envy, jealousy, offence, bitterness, strife - those qualities are still there;
    <br>it is not too late now.
    <br>And right now, we are in the House of God at the beginning of that year. What a wonderful year!
    <br>This is why I call it "Wonderful Year".
    <br>Let me tell you something. Assume this year did not start on a Sunday like last year.
    <br>You know where you were last year. You were with friends.
    <br>You know the 1st January is the time you use to visit friends, go for tourism,
    <br>which is opposite to where we are now.
    <br>Look at where you find yourself.
    <br>The approach you give to this year is so wonderful -
    <br>the best approach one can give is to trust and obey.
    <br>So this is why we are here today.
    <br>It is not too late to settle our accounts on the 1st of January.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>That has to do with your heart.
    <br>Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall settle their accounts.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Blessed are the pure in heart; they shall settle their accounts".
    <br>That is, you will see God, you will have a new beginning, you will have a new dream.
    <br>I want to take you back again. The revelation I have for you.
    <br>Are you ready to listen now?
    <br>Just listen and write it down.
    <br>I was in a vision and the Lord gave me a dream for you.
    <br>You may exclude yourself, you may include yourself -
    <br>it is a matter of faith.
    <br>They say, "Yes, this man is talking to me" or "No, this man is not talking to me".
    <br>It is a matter of choice.
    <br>The Lord revealed to me that this year will come with unique challenges, so many challenges.
    <br>Tell your people, they should believe and trust;
    <br>just trust and obey.
    <br>Are you writing it?
    <br>Just trust and obey.
    <br>The Lord said, "Remember, I am the Father of dreams".
    <br>He started telling me some of the people He had given dreams.
    <br>"I am sending you to your people; give them this dream".
    <br>He said He gave a dream to Abraham,
    <br>a dream to Daniel,
    <br>a dream to Joseph,
    <br>a dream to Peter and I woke up.
    <br>When I woke up, I said, "What is this?
    <br>I realized that, "Oh no, this is a Voice from Heaven".
    <br>The vision continued.
    <br>Here are dreams - dream of walking with the Lord, a new dream for you.
    <br>Whether you like it or not, this year - don't just delay, something will propel you -
    <br>the unique challenges, which you will know yourself that no witchdoctor will help you,
    <br>no fake people, spiritualists or whatever can help you.
    <br>You will know yourself, you will be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that nobody can help you.
    <br>Let me run to God.
    <br>You will run a proper run to God this year.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There will be a force you cannot resist.
    <br>Dream of walking with the Lord - a new dream for you this year, 2017.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Dream of walking with the Lord - a new dream for you this year, 2017.
    <br>You have not started. When you leave here, you will see what will be happening in your life.
    <br>By the time you leave here, you will start seeing a force you cannot resist.
    <br>You want to pray and fast the more.
    <br>The more the attack, the more you pray and fast this year.
    <br>You have been serving God in the past intellectually. That is how you serve God.
    <br>That will not work this year.
    <br>You will serve God with all your heart this year. That is a new dream for you.
    <br>The more the challenges, the more your desire for God this year.
    <br>So, the challenges we are talking about are a blessing.
    <br>It's a blessing then.
    <br>Whatever challenges T.B. Joshua is talking about are a blessing
    <br>because the more the challenges, the more my desire for God.
    <br>It's a blessing. Let it come! I want to draw closer to God.
    <br>If that will draw me closer to God, it's a blessing!
    <br>So, now, there is no cause for fear.
    <br>Before now, when challenges come, in the past 2016, you begin to run helter skelter,
    <br>running to spiritualists, running to this, running to that, spending money; being afraid; fear.
    <br>Running from God instead of running to God.
    <br>It's a good year.
    <br>I know you are asking yourself, "How would this happen? How would my desire for God happen?"
    <br>Because when trouble comes, you always panic.
    <br>You say, "Ah, how will I get out of this trouble?"
    <br>Rejoice.
    <br>This year - I don't know how it will happen.
    <br>The vision I saw for you, number ONE:
    <br>Dream of walking with the Lord - a new dream for you.
    <br>A new dream has come. Happy New Year!
    <br>Nothing and nothing will stop you from the love of God this year.
    <br>No challenges will stop you from the love of God.
    <br>No difficult circumstances can stop you from the love of God.
    <br>No infirmity will stop you from the love of God.
    <br>The more they come, the more your desire for God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Stand up and give thanks to God!
    <br>The aim and objective of satan is to separate you.
    <br>He uses challenges and difficult circumstances to separate you,
    <br>to bring you into sin, to confess him. This is just the aim of satan.
    <br>But his aim has been defeated! The more they come, the more your desire.
    <br>The more the challenges, trouble, sickness, infirmity - just name those things satan can bring -
    <br>the more they come, the more your desire and determination for God.
    <br>His aim has been defeated.
    <br>Be strong; trust Him. That is the key to begin this year.
    <br>When I had this vision, I was happy.
    <br>Immediately I stood up, I said, "Lord, thank You".
    <br>This is what I have been praying for.
    <br>This is what has been rescuing me.
    <br>This is the tactic and strategy that has been protecting me.
    <br>The more these people come, the more my desire.
    <br>The more these people attack, the more my desire and my determination.
    <br>The more they hate me, the more my desire and determination.
    <br>The more people speak bad of me, the more my desire and determination. This has been protecting me.
    <br>When satan realises that the more he attacks you, the more your desire for God, he will leave you.
    <br>That is satan for you.
    <br>At the beginning of this year, it may be a bit rough.
    <br>But when he realises that, this person,  I cannot separate this person with challenges.
    <br>No matter the sickness, this person will not deny God.
    <br>No matter the difficult circumstances coming to this man, he will not...
    <br>Look at what happened to Job. The more he afflicted this person, the more he loved Jesus.
    <br>He'll just say, "Oh, this one is not one of us. Let him just..." He will leave you.
    <br>But the moment he realises that when he hits you, you look back.
    <br>It is not possible to look back to answer your enemy and at the same time continue the journey.
    <br>Look at: "What are you saying?"
    <br>Where are you going then?
    <br>Where am I going now? I am going nowhere.
    <br>That is the journey you have been walking with the Lord.
    <br>That is your journey with the Lord.
    <br>Come, brother; come here.
    <br>Let me show you what I am talking about. This is God. Stand here.
    <br>I don't want to use anybody for satan.
    <br>I don't want to.
    <br>We are in a New Year.
    <br>This is satan here. Can you see?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see? Ok. Here is this foolish man.
    <br>Here, you. You represent T.B. Joshua and this is God - where you are going.
    <br>You are on the way, and this hits - when he hits you, it's either disappointment or failure
    <br>or setback
    <br>or sickness, something.
    <br>This is - he can't just hit you without these nightmares.
    <br>You're just going, just going... he'll just hit you.
    <br>When he hits you, you'll say, "Eh hen, eh hen".
    <br>You know you're going, you cannot see this place.
    <br>This is where you'll be concentrating - "Eh hen, eh hen."
    <br>This is where you're going - "Eh hen, eh hen."
    <br>Can you see? Where am I going now?
    <br>That is the journey you have embarked on.
    <br>His interest is to cause you your position,
    <br>to overthrow you and to cause you setback and limitation.
    <br>See where I am going, instead of going straight.
    <br>You will not be able to run a straight race.
    <br>Now, here satan hit me. The journey I have embarked on.
    <br>This is me, T.B. Joshua now.
    <br>If he hits me, I will be talking, praying to fight satan, but I will not look back.
    <br>I'm fighting, but I continue my journey.
    <br>That is why you are here today.
    <br>If this journey had been a straight race, you would not be here today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You would not be here today.
    <br>Your business has not been a straight race.
    <br>Your finances have not been a straight race.
    <br>Your marriage has not been a straight race.
    <br>This is why you have to run a straight race.
    <br>The more satan hits you, the more you should speed up your spiritual walk.
    <br>A hit of satan is like you are climbing a hill on a bike.
    <br>When you are climbing the hill on the bike, you put it on a smaller gear so it can move.
    <br>The more you are hit, either sickness or disease, that does not make you a child of satan.
    <br>You can be sick in body and yet be a child of God. Continue your race.
    <br>This is what the Lord said now.
    <br>A new dream of walking with the Lord - a new dream for you.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: A NEW DREAM FOR YOU
    <br>When these attacks are not coming, your dream cannot come.
    <br>It is your dream that attracts the challenges.
    <br>If there is no dream, there are no challenges.
    <br>No dream, no challenges.
    <br>Dream of walking with the Lord - if there is no dream of walking with the Lord, there are no challenges.
    <br>So, you are happy concerning new dream, but it attracts challenges.
    <br>So my brother,
    <br>when challenges come, remember your dream and your goal.
    <br>Nothing can be compared with your dream and your goal.
    <br>TWO: Don't forget what I said. It was not a message, it was a vision.
    <br>Your wailing will be silenced.
    <br>The voice of trouble, difficulty, setback shall be silenced!
    <br>Their voices shall be silenced!
    <br>Write it down.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hmm, yes. It shall be silenced.
    <br>This will begin to manifest from June.
    <br>From January to June, you should be ready to fight.
    <br>Challenges, difficulties from now till June.
    <br>But by June...
    <br>When you trust and obey, satan will know that you cannot be separated. He will leave you alone.
    <br>All over the world. I am not talking to any particular nation. All over the world.
    <br>Those who are under the influence of my voice.
    <br>Viewers, you are under the influence of my voice. Write it down, it will guide you.
    <br>It's a guide to help you throughout this year.
    <br>If you can do that, satan will soon know that you are not the type to be disturbed,
    <br>to be separated from God. He will soon know.
    <br>But satan has not yet known. He still believes he can separate you from God.
    <br>That is why he keeps pushing you. He knows you will soon follow him and renounce God.
    <br>Let him know nothing can separate you from the love of God.
    <br>Can hardship, sickness, infirmity, setback, poverty, humiliation or temptation? Nothing!
    <br>Talk to your God right now.
    <br>Nothing can make me look back! Nothing can separate me!
    <br>Nothing, yes. Talk to your God.
    <br>They will come with their humiliation, challenges, setback, disease and sickness!
    <br>They will come; let them come!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Dream of walking with the Lord - that means there will be grace for you, inner grace.
    <br>Oh My God...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>All you lack and all you want, your business is not going well; your health is not ok.
    <br>Who owns your health? Who owns your business?
    <br>Do you know God is richer than your dreams?
    <br>He will put everything in place.
    <br>I will not use the word, "Congratulations"; I will say, "At last, a new dream has come!"
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>So, you are blessed.
    <br>Do you have any questions before we go further?
    <br>You have a question?
    <br>It is not really a question. You have just been speaking about me.
    <br>For 5 years 7 months I have been in the bush fighting to come here, and this is my coming.
    <br>And all you have been speaking is about me.
    <br>For the past 5 years you have been trying to come?
    <br>Yes, 5 years 7 months. Drinking once, eating once at the mountain.
    <br>Until this time around, I've managed to come here.
    <br>I saw God. I saw Him.
    <br>Ah, you cannot see God. You'll only hear His instruction.
    <br>Something might have gone wrong somewhere.
    <br>Sometimes, when we do not have a proper discretion
    <br>because God has given us discretion;
    <br>that discretion, He does not tamper with it.
    <br>He gives us the right to speak our mind.
    <br>But there could be a wrong discretion.
    <br>We need to be in a proper state, to act with God.
    <br>If you are not in a proper state to act with God, you need someone to intervene -
    <br>to be an intermediary between you and God.
    <br>How many years did you say you spent on the mountain?
    <br>5 years 7 months.
    <br>My God. I need to see you, sir.
    <br>Something is wrong somewhere.
    <br>And while you were in the mountain, you were eating?
    <br>I was drinking once and eating once. These were the instructions.
    <br>Eating once?
    <br>I was eating once since 2002.
    <br>At what time?
    <br>20:00 hrs.
    <br>Ah, ok. I want to see my brother.
    <br>Like I said, God is so much concerned about us.
    <br>Most especially, when you have family.
    <br>He will not now carry you from your family and put you in the mountain for 5 years.
    <br>What of the family at home, wife and children?
    <br>Our God is so concerned about us. He loves us so much.
    <br>Just like He loved all His Apostles.
    <br>So that's why I'm concerned that the "god" you're talking about carried you to the mountain for 5 years,
    <br>the family is at home, the children are at home and you are eating once, what would the family eat?
    <br>And you are the breadwinner of the family. I think something is wrong somewhere.
    <br>Things were not normal.
    <br>No. I was putting on green; I didn't have anywhere to stay.
    <br>I used to wear green ladies trousers and pink ladies trousers.
    <br>Don't worry, sir. I understand that something has happened. That's what I'm saying.
    <br>Everything will be alright. That is why we are here.Thank  you.
    <br>Ok, any other questions?
    <br>Let's ask our mummy here.
    <br>You have a question? Ok.
    <br>So these challenges will only attack us but not kill us?
    <br>She is afraid of death.
    <br>Do you hear what she is asking me?
    <br>She said, "These challenges. Do I mean that they will only attack us but will not kill us?"
    <br>Already, you have been having challenges. Even as you are standing now, you have challenges.
    <br>But those challenges have not killed you since. You are still alive.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So why do you thinkg of death?
    <br>Because, maybe.....
    <br>Do you have a covenant?
    <br>No.
    <br>No, I was just thinking that, maybe if a challenge comes, like sickness to a loved one.
    <br>Do you mean that you have not been sick before?
    <br>I have.
    <br>That's it.
    <br>So thank you. You are clear. Ok, I like that.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>You have answered all my questions why I am here.
    <br>Now, since 2017 is a wonderful year, I love my nation Kenya. We are having elections.
    <br>I am asking that you visit me in a dream, so that I know how to pray about my nation.
    <br>God bless you, sir.
    <br>You want to take me back to what I have written there.
    <br>Even your country is one of the countries that is on that paper there.
    <br>If I may tell you just a bit of what is on that paper.
    <br>It will be very very close like this and it will be difficult to call.
    <br>I will not say more than that.
    <br>Can you see, when something is close like this and it will be difficult to call.
    <br>I don't want to go back to what is in the paper.
    <br>Because it is one of the things in the paper. It will be very close like this.
    <br>The opposition and the ruling. It will be very very difficult to call.
    <br>From there, more, I will not be able to say more than that. I am not here for that now.
    <br>Therefore, what can you be expecting from there?
    <br>So I will see you. Thank you.
    <br>So you love your nation so much?
