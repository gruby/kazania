  <p>    
    <br>There is a woman there, you have this spirit of woman and it is tormenting you, disturbing you.
    <br>Please come out; she is under the gallery - very close to the pillar.
    <br>Come, I am looking at you; don't hide.
    <br>Jesus loves you. You are there. Please come.
    <br>You know you have the spirit of stealing.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Man of God, I am the lady you said that has the spirit of stealing.
    <br>This spirit disgraces me at my workplace.
    <br>I am an auxiliary nurse.
    <br>Any office where they employ me, I steal, then, they will sack me.
    <br>Also, in the market.
    <br>What did your mummy tell you when you were very small?
    <br>When I was in primary school, my mummy used to take me to many native doctors.
    <br>But she told you something.
    <br>You know there was a place where you people crossed the river.
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>- To see a spiritualist.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>And you people spent one day and one night there.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>"DEMONS ðŸ‘¹Appear To Me PHYSICALLY!!!" | SHOCKING PROPHECY!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Uyai Akpan.
    <br>I am from Akwa Ibom.
    <br>The woman you saw there is me.
    <br>It all started when I got married.
    <br>After two weeks of my marriage, when I was alone in the house,
    <br>a man would appear to me physically.
    <br>He would start talking to me and he would open his hands.
    <br>Once he opened his hands, I would find myself in another world with him.
    <br>He would open his hands; they would be full of money, cars, wealth, mansions.
    <br>He would talk with me; I would flow with him.
    <br>After that, he would leave and I would come back to my senses.
    <br>That was when the spirit of stealing came into me.
    <br>As an auxiliary nurse, in any office that employed me, I was in charge of money.
    <br>It is not that I did not have money.
    <br>I had money but an urge would come into me to steal.
    <br>Immediately I stole, I would come back to my senses.
    <br>I would ask myself, "Why did I do this? I am not supposed to do this."
    <br>Immediately I would steal the money, I would be caught and disgraced.
    <br>The worst one was in my office in the market when I stole my boss' money.
    <br>My boss was so angry.
    <br>He wanted to expose me to the people in the market to beat me and strip me naked
    <br>but when he considered it, he said there must be something wrong with me.
    <br>He hid me but could not condone it so he fired me from my job.
    <br>I went in search of work at another office.
    <br>Still, the man would appear to me, even when I was in the office.
    <br>Nobody would see the man; only I would see the man.
    <br>I would start talking with that man.
    <br>Some of my co-workers would ask me, "Who are you talking with?"
    <br>I would come to my senses and then the man would disappear.
    <br>As a person who was in charge of money, I would steal.
    <br>They would catch me and fire me.
    <br>They have fired me in four different offices.
    <br>This is what happened to me after my marriage.
    <br>Concerning the spirit of woman,
    <br>the man of God said I had the spirit of woman.
    <br>A demonic man would come to me in my dream.
    <br>When he would come to me, he would change to a woman and have an affair with me.
    <br>After that, when I would wake up, I would have the urge to masturbate.
    <br>I would masturbate seriously to the point I got tired.
    <br>I had been to many places to be delivered of this problem
    <br>but the more places I went to, the more severe the problem became in my life.
    <br>It got to a point I could not even go out in search for a job anymore
    <br>because anywhere I worked, I would steal and they would fire me.
    <br>I decided to stay at home.
    <br>I went to see a friend of mine and said, "I am tired. It is not that I don't have money;
    <br>I have enough money but look at what is happening to me."
    <br>She said, "All the time you have been going through this, there is a church called The SCOAN.
    <br>You can go there."
    <br>Immediately she spoke to me, I packed my bag and ran down here.
    <br>As a married woman, this problem has brought challenges to my marriage.
    <br>It led to separation and now, it has led to divorce.
    <br>"DEMONS ðŸ‘¹Appear To Me PHYSICALLY!!!" | SHOCKING PROPHECY!
    <br>Behold, that Sunday, God exposed the devil in my life.
    <br>While I was sitting on the gallery, the man of God, during the mass prayer, said,
    <br>"There is a woman there sitting on the gallery. Don't be afraid; don't fear. Come. God loves you."
    <br>I said, "Today is my day."
    <br>He said, "You have the spirit of woman and the spirit of stealing."
    <br>That was when I came out.
    <br>Behold, the man of God prayed for me and I was delivered from all the demonic attacks in my life.
    <br>Hallelujah! Shall we put our hands together louder for Jesus?
    <br>After the man of God prayed for me, it was as if a heavy load lifted off me.
    <br>Now, I am light and feel happy.
    <br>That spirit of woman can no longer come to me.
    <br>The urge to steal - I can no longer remember it.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>There is God here, really.
    <br>When I ran down here, I became free.
    <br>I want to say a few words to everybody: If you have a problem, run to God.
    <br>Do not just stay at home and fold your hands.
    <br>God is here to deliver you and bring you back to a normal state of mind and body, in Jesus' name!
    <br>"DEMONS ðŸ‘¹Appear To Me PHYSICALLY!!!" | SHOCKING PROPHECY!
    <br>Madam, we really appreciate our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ for this wonderful deliverance,
    <br>you have just received and your life indeed has been totally transformed,
    <br>and you have been redeemed and we give glory to God Almighty.
    <br>We just want to advise you that now that God Almighty has delivered you,
    <br>and got you out of shame and embarrassment and put you in the kingdom of light,
    <br>you should make sure that you continue to follow in the light of your testimony,
    <br>by making God's Word the standard for your life,
    <br>knowing that those who have been delivered by God's Word
    <br>must go and be ruled by His Word.
    <br>We know that God Almighty will give you that grace to continue to stay far from sin
    <br>and be close to Him, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus.
