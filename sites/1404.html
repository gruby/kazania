  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You Jesus!"
    <br>Lift up your hands, say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Jesus is the reason we are here today.
    <br>Happy Easter, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Greet the viewers, "Happy Easter, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for what You have done.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>This is a time for sober reflection on life itself.
    <br>Christians all over the world observe this Easter to honour Christ's victory over death.
    <br>The Bible says that we are saved by a Gospel that tells us that Jesus Christ died for our sins
    <br>and rose from the dead.
    <br>Embracing this message is what has saved us today.
    <br>The Blood He shed on the Cross, the Blood that dripped from His hands, His feet, His head
    <br>is the most precious commodity in the history of mankind.
    <br>Jesus has purchased for you and me at the price of great suffering salvation, deliverance,
    <br>healing and all of God's blessings.
    <br>The Son of God came all the way down from Heaven to put an end to our unworthy past
    <br>and to give us a life that is full and free.
    <br>Let somebody say, "A life that is full and free."
    <br>Imagine a life without guilt, without condemnation, without fear,
    <br>without inferiority complex, with the peace of God - a contented life.
    <br>What a wonderful life!
    <br>Let someone say, "What a blessed life!"
    <br>That is the promise of God for you and me.
    <br>This brings us to our message this morning:
    <br>A LIFE ANEW
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, a life anew."
    <br>Say, "Jesus has come to put an end to my unworthy past and to give me a glorious new existence."
    <br>Let's take our Bibles quickly to the Book of Romans 6, I start my reading from verse 4.
    <br>It says:
    <br>"Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death,
    <br>that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
    <br>even so we also should walk in newness of life.
    <br>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death,
    <br>certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection,
    <br>knowing this that our old man was crucified with Him,
    <br>that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.
    <br>For he who has died has been freed from sin.
    <br>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him."
    <br>Let somebody say, "Praise the Lord!"
    <br>Let someone say, "Praise the Lord!"
    <br>The testimony of the Spirit of God says in the Book of Romans 1:3-4
    <br>that Jesus is declared to be the Son of God with power by His resurrection from the dead.
    <br>The question is: What does Jesus' resurrection mean to you and me?
    <br>When we talk of resurrection, we are talking of the rare privilege, opportunity
    <br>God has given to you and me, all believers, to experience a new beginning -
    <br>a situation where every dead part of our lives, every dead area of our lives receives life anew.
    <br>Let someone say, "A life anew."
    <br>Every dead area of our lives receives life anew.
    <br>Resurrection simply means to become alive again, or a new beginning.
    <br>How does it refer to our lives as believers?
    <br>To be born again, the believer must first die with Christ and resurrect with Him.
    <br>This means we must die to our unworthy past and be alive to our future.
    <br>This means sin's power over us is broken and we put on Christ as newness of life.
    <br>In Him we live, in Him we move, in Him we have our being.
    <br>This is the significance of resurrection.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus rose I rose
    <br>When He rose we rose
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus rose I rose
    <br>When He rose we rose
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus rose I rose
    <br>When He rose we rose
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You heard the song:
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken!
    <br>This means our past is over!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Say, "My past is over."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your past is over. My past is over. Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Yes, brethren, our past is over.
    <br>This means to conquer your past, there is something we need to do.
    <br>You must keep in the forefront of your heart
    <br>that satan always discusses our past but Jesus discusses our future.
    <br>The devil discusses our past
    <br>because it appears to be the only information he has against you.
    <br>That is why Jesus warns us not to look back.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't look back. Your past is over!"
    <br>Jesus refers to Lot's wife in the Book of Luke 17:32.
    <br>It was the warning Jesus gave to us
    <br>not to go back to the world and flesh we have already renounced.
    <br>When you look at the Book of Genesis 19
    <br>where God instructed Lot's family not to look back,
    <br>the Lord was simply saying to them,
    <br>'Now that you are sanctified, don't look back,
    <br>don't go back to the impurities of the world I am delivering you from
    <br>and you shall be saved indeed.'
    <br>The Bible says that Lot's wife still longed for Sodom and its forbidden indulgences.
    <br>She was much about her property, houses she was leaving in Sodom.
    <br>Despite the fact that she received a special grace in her deliverance from Sodom,
    <br>the Book of Genesis 19:26 says that she was not dead to her past.
    <br>Her heart never checked out of Sodom.
    <br>Her heart was still that way.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, where your treasure is, there your heart is."
    <br>She looked back and she was doomed to destruction.
    <br>In the Book of John 8:11, Jesus met the woman caught in adultery and told her,
    <br>'I do not condemn you. Go and sin no more.'
    <br>When the Lord met the man He healed at the Pool of Bethesda in John 5:14,
    <br>the Lord said to Him, 'See, you are well again.
    <br>Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you'.
    <br>In these Biblical passages Jesus Christ is simply saying a warning,
    <br>'See, your past is over. Stop looking back or something worse may happen to you'.
    <br>The Lord is saying, 'Now you are sanctified, cleansed by the Word of God,
    <br>you should remain cleansed and stop reliving the past in your present life.'
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, stop reliving your past in your present life because your past is over."
    <br>To look back is a trap of the devil.
    <br>To look back is to open oneself up to the impurities of the world
    <br>we have already renounced.
    <br>When you focus on your past, your present is in danger and your future is tarnished.
    <br>Each time you want to focus on your future, the devil is already there,
    <br>always there to remind you of your unworthy past in order to provoke your guilt, your fear
    <br>and to hinder your future.
    <br>Don't look back.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, my past is over. I shall not go back to it."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't look back. Look to the future."
    <br>Jesus owns our future.
    <br>No matter what your life holds, there is a future for you.
    <br>Jesus never consults your past to determine your future.
    <br>He said in the Book of John 14:2,
    <br>'In my Father's house are many mansions. I will go and prepare a place for you.'
    <br>This is the plan of God for you, for me.
    <br>Believing - that is our connection to that plan.
    <br>With our heart we believe unto righteousness.
    <br>In the Book of Matthew 21, on Palm Sunday when Jesus entered the Temple,
    <br>He began to sanctify the temple to remove anything that was not of God
    <br>because God cannot dwell in an unholy place.
    <br>Remember, our heart is the temple.
    <br>Say, "My heart is the temple."
    <br>Therefore, God is interested in the state of our hearts because our heart is the dwelling place;
    <br>our heart is the prayer room.
    <br>Say, "My heart is the prayer room."
    <br>The question: What is the condition of our heart?
    <br>What is the state of our heart today?
    <br>Our life reflects what is in our heart.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua says,
    <br>"I am what is in my heart. You are what is in your heart."
    <br>What is in your heart?
    <br>Today, many hearts are closed, locked to the truth
    <br>because of bitterness, anger, unforgiving spirit.
    <br>The harbouring of unforgiving spirit damages our hearts and breaks the communion with God.
    <br>Remember, Jesus came to restore our relationship with God.
    <br>The harbouring of the spirit of unforgiveness breaks the communion with God.
    <br>Remember, when you pray,
    <br>God listens to our prayers and responds to us according to the state of our heart.
    <br>Therefore, as we stand in His presence, we should not only lift up clean hands but also a pure heart.
    <br>If your prayer seems to delay, it may be because your words need healing,
    <br>because our heart needs healing.
    <br>Say, "Lord, dirty as I am, You can still cleanse me."
    <br>Cleanse me, Lord.
    <br>Prayer is the shortest route between God and our heart.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave us a prayer that can usher us into that future,
    <br>into the Kingdom of God:
    <br>"Lord, open my heart to Your Word, open my heart to Your Spirit,
    <br>open my heart to Your faith."
    <br>Say, "Lord, open my heart to Your Word, open my heart to Your Spirit,
    <br>open my heart to Your faith."
    <br>Open my heart to Your Word because the Bible says in Romans 10:8
    <br>that God has given us the Word of faith.
    <br>The Word must find its place in our heart because it is when the Word enters our heart,
    <br>our spirit acts on that Word.
    <br>And the more our spirit acts on the Word,
    <br>the more it influences our behaviour and conduct.
    <br>This is the way of the Lord.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, not only must we have God's Word, we must have God's Spirit."
    <br>Say, "Lord, open my heart to Your Spirit."
    <br>2 Corinthians 4:13 says that God has given us the Spirit of faith.
    <br>The work of the Holy Spirit always begins in the understanding.
    <br>It means no one can obey the written Word without His help.
    <br>No one can live right without His help.
    <br>He opens our eyes to see how wrong our sins are.
    <br>He helps us to accept Jesus as our Lord and Saviour in faith
    <br>and completely changes our life.
    <br>Say, "Lord, open my heart to Your faith."
    <br>Romans 12:3 says that God has given us a measure of faith.
    <br>Our heart must be purified by faith and be entirely for God.
    <br>Say, "My heart must be purified by faith and be entirely for God."
    <br>Faith purifies us, justifies us and removes the burden, the mountain of guilt of our past.
    <br>If this is done, you are like unto God.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't look back. Jesus has risen!"
    <br>Say, "Jesus has risen!"
    <br>Today a new way, a new life, a new fellowship has come.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>Brethren finally, no matter the situation you are in,
    <br>no matter the mistake you must have done with your life in the past,
    <br>the greatest love Jesus Christ has given us is the opportunity to correct our mistakes.
    <br>If mistakes were not correctable, no one would enter the Kingdom of Heaven
    <br>but we have an assurance.
    <br>Say, "I have an assurance."
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua calls this 'a mattress of spirituality'.
    <br>Do you know mattress?
    <br>It is firm at both ends.
    <br>Our faith lies secure on it.
    <br>Jesus Christ of Nazareth, by His resurrection from death,
    <br>is worthy to be the object of our faith.
    <br>He is alive.
    <br>Let someone say, "He is alive."
    <br>We have this strong confidence in Christ that our future is secure.
    <br>Say, "My past is over because I know that my sins have been forgiven."
    <br>Therefore, I have no question about my past. My past is over.
    <br>So, if the devil reminds you about your past, remind him about your future.
    <br>Say, "My future is secure because I know where I'm going."
    <br>Heaven is my home.
    <br>I have no question about my future.
    <br>My past is over.
    <br>Let someone say, "A life anew - a new life in Christ Jesus,
    <br>be it in your home, be it in your business, be it in your life, in Jesus' name."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, never you talk or think on the level of the old life."
    <br>My past is over.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "My past is over."
    <br>As a Christian, as a child of God, your past should no longer control your thoughts.
    <br>Your past should no longer control your thoughts
    <br>because Jesus does not want you to look back.
    <br>In which area of your life are you struggling with the temptation
    <br>to take journeys into yesterday?
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>"In which area of your life are you tempted to take journeys into yesterday?"
    <br>Have you been cheated in the past?
    <br>Did someone betray you in the past?
    <br>Do you feel guilty, condemned?
    <br>Remember, Jesus has come to put an end to our past.
    <br>You can be physically stressed, you can be emotionally stressed
    <br>but don't allow yourself to be spiritually stressed
    <br>because if you are, you will lose focus on God and it will hinder your future.
    <br>So right now, say, "Neighbour,
    <br>today is my day. This is the day that the Lord has made.
    <br>I will rejoice and be glad in it because Jesus is alive."
    <br>We are celebrating His life.
    <br>He is in our midst.
    <br>Any moment from now, you will see His name working in the Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You will see His Word working in the Spirit -
    <br>His power and anointing breaking the yokes, setting the captives free.
    <br>Remember what He said, 'I shall be with you always until the end of the earth.'
    <br>No one that influences the thinking of human beings has ever said this - only Jesus.
    <br>So, right now, as you sit in silence, begin to meditate,
    <br>Lord, open my heart to Your Word, open my heart to Your Spirit,
    <br>open my heart to Your faith, in Jesus' name!
    <br>May God bless His Word.
