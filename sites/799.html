  <p>    
    <br>On Sunday 16th April, 2017, during a Live
    <br>Service at The SCOAN, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>gave a prophecy concerning a Russian Airline.
    <br>These were his words...
    <br>"Lift your voice and pray for a Russian airline
    <br>that carries passengers.
    <br>On Wednesday, please, pray and fast for protection.
    <br>A Russian airline that carries passengers
    <br>- help them in prayer and pray against any accident.
    <br>The world is one.
    <br>We pray and protect ourselves.
    <br>We ask God to cover the whole world with His
    <br>blood.
    <br>With your prayer, the Lord will cover them
    <br>with the blood of Jesus and they will be protected.
    <br>Thank you."
