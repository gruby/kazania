    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Here is Wise Man Daniel moving in the midst of The SCOAN's congregation,
    <br>and praying for the people in the power of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>The lightning of God flows through the faculties of Wise Man Daniel
    <br>to expose all the darkness in the lives of the people.
    <br>As he moves in the congregation, he encounters this lady who instantly reacts
    <br>as the light of God exposes the darkness in her life.
    <br>Let's watch the encounter.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>All over your body - fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>You can't resist it.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus! All over your body.
    <br>Speak out, who are you!
    <br>What is your mission?
    <br>Daniel! So, you are among the five people that have been disturbing my kingdom!
    <br>You have been tormenting my kingdom!
    <br>Where are my queens and princesses?
    <br>They are missing; I can't find them. Daniel, why is it?
    <br>I called your master the other day. I want to ask you a question.
    <br>What have we done to you? Why are you fighting us?
    <br>We are not fighting you but you are fighting us. Why?
    <br>My queens, princesses and kings – I can't find them anymore.
    <br>There is no one to send a message or to go on an errand for me. Why?
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am the queen mother. We are many.
    <br>I came myself; I came from my throne.
    <br>Me, Osun.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You said you left your throne and came here.
    <br>Yes, I came myself to ask you a question.
    <br>What is it? What have we done to you?
    <br>Why are you making me lose my queens, princesses and kings? Why?
    <br>Where are your princesses, kings, princes?
    <br>They came to this place and you collected them from me.
    <br>I can't find them anymore; I can't see them anymore.
    <br>There is no one to go on an errand for me.
    <br>Last month, you collected a big person from me, one of my big queens. Why?
    <br>This is the house of God. Demons have no place here. Your people are demons?
    <br>My people are demons.
    <br>Do we torment you? Why are you tormenting me?
    <br>Why are you tormenting the spirit of Osun, the marine?
    <br>Why are you disturbing us?
    <br>Why are you disturbing the fishes, the big fish in the river and the snails? Why?
    <br>I said I called your master.
    <br>Physically or spiritually?
    <br>I called him on the phone physically.
    <br>You were physically in her and called. What did you say when you called?
    <br>I told him that he's battling my kingdom and I am ready for him.
    <br>He ordered me to come here and I came. Me, great Osun, Ezenwanyi.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>As a queen mother, how do you operate in this body?
    <br>We are many in this body.
    <br>How many of you are in this body?
    <br>The spirit of the marine. This is the big fish that lives in the river Niger,
    <br>the spiritual husband and the idol spirit from her father's house.
    <br>You said this place is tormenting your kingdom.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Arresting your queens, princes, princesses, and kings.
    <br>How is this place tormenting your kingdom?
    <br>This place? Any time that any of my queens, princesses or kings come here,
    <br>before I know it, I see another light in them that I cannot go near. Why?
    <br>What is here that is arresting them?
    <br>What is here that is arresting your demons?
    <br>You know this. Why are you asking me? You know. Can't you see the light everywhere?
    <br>Where is the light?
    <br>Can't you see it?
    <br>You see it because you have four eyes – the physical eyes and the spiritual ones.
    <br>Why are you asking me? Can't you see the light of the Righteous Man everywhere? Can't you see it?
    <br>What is the light doing to your kingdom, you demon?
    <br>The light has been disturbing my kingdom.
    <br>I am losing my queens, princesses and kings every day, all the time.
    <br>OK, let's come to this body. What have you done to this body? The body of the lady you are occupying.
    <br>This body? I have destroyed her.
    <br>How?
    <br>I have destroyed this body.
    <br>She read Catering and Hotel Management.
    <br>After her graduation, she came to Lagos to look for a job.
    <br>I knew that any hotel she applied to as a chef, they would give her an appointment.
    <br>I used to go before her. Even when she did the practical, she would pass it.
    <br>They would give her an appointment letter.
    <br>I would go and incite their mind and they would look for one excuse to dismiss her
    <br>when she was supposed to resume for work.
    <br>When they do the test for her she would pass?
    <br>She would pass.
    <br>But on the appointment day, what would you do?
    <br>They would give her an appointment letter.
    <br>When it is that time, I would go there and cause hatred; they would dislike her.
    <br>Those who were supposed to employ her - you would possess them?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>What would happen when you possess them?
    <br>They would dislike her.
    <br>Even though they initially asked her to come?
    <br>All of a sudden they would hate her?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>How would she feel?
    <br>She would be crying.
    <br>How would you, queen mother, feel?
    <br>I would be very happy.
    <br>Secondly, I looked at her certificates that she was carrying up and down.
    <br>I sent floods to the house where she kept her credentials to spoil everything.
    <br>OK, right now, you demon - your end has come.
    <br>It is the right time you leave this body.
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Daniel.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Why are you touching my crown? Stop.
    <br>Useless crown.
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body - fire, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Right now go, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You are free. Rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>Fine.
    <br>You are fine?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You wanted to fight me here.
    <br>No.
    <br>You were trying to put your fingers into my eyes.
    <br>No.
    <br>You said that you were the queen mother, a big fish inside the river Niger and an idol.
    <br>I don't know.
    <br>I know I used to dream about being in a big river, sitting down with my crown on my head
    <br>and people would be bowing down before me.
    <br>We learnt you made a call to the church. Can you tell us the reason why you called the man of God?
    <br>I don't know. I don't even know when I did it.
    <br>It is a friend of mine who told me that I had called.
    <br>I was kind of quarrelling with them that they were disturbing my kingdom.
    <br>When my friend told me this, I didn't believe it.
    <br>You didn't know when you called?
    <br>That demonic crown, the demonic queen, queen mother is out of you.
    <br>The idol is out of you. The big fish is gone.
    <br>Live your life to please Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Chinasa Victoria Okorie.
    <br>I am from Ebonyi State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problems that brought me to The SCOAN were a strong marine spirit and a spiritual husband.
    <br>Actually, I cannot say how the evil spirit entered me but I grew up with it.
    <br>My father is a man of God.
    <br>When I was still in primary school, Primary 1 and 2,
    <br>my dad used to tell me that I was possessed because of the way I behaved.
    <br>I wouldn't eat and could go for three days without tasting anything.
    <br>If you forced me to eat, it would be a problem.
    <br>I wasn’t happy and would always cry. I didn't want to play with anybody.
    <br>I liked to stay on my own and didn't want anybody to talk to me.
    <br>I even hated my mother, father and everybody around me.
    <br>I always wanted to sleep because when I slept, I would see myself with people I didn't know.
    <br>I enjoyed playing and eating with them; I was happy with them.
    <br>As time went on, my dad and mum really tried and took me to many places.
    <br>My dad being a man of God, invited all his prayer warriors, ministers, friends.
    <br>They tried to deliver me many times but during the deliverance,
    <br>I would just be laughing and looking at them.
    <br>It has been going like that.
    <br>They really tried and took me to many places.
    <br>Actually I was born and brought up in Ondo State, Akure.
    <br>They took me in Ondo and to other States for deliverance but it did not work.
    <br>From Primary 3 it continued until I entered Secondary School and when I was in JSS3,
    <br>they crowned me the queen of the ocean.
    <br>The celebration was so awesome – many people such as kings, princes,
    <br>governors and presidents from countries all over the world, were present there in the spiritual world that day.
    <br>They crowned me the queen that day.
    <br>They gave me powers in my eyes, mouth and hips.
    <br>If someone provoked me and I cried, a bad thing would happen to that person.
    <br>If a person provoked me and I said, "As you are going, a car will hit you!" -
    <br>it would not be more than five minutes before it happened.
    <br>My friends started calling me a witch and all kinds of names.
    <br>It continued like that until I was in SSS2 when they came to me.
    <br>I used to see them physically; if I sat down and wanted to see them, I would.
    <br>I used to talk to them.
    <br>My mum noticed that I would be talking but she would not see anybody talking to me.
    <br>She would ask me if I was mad and I would tell her to leave me alone,
    <br>that I was just thinking about something and she would leave me.
    <br>When I was in SSS2, they came to me physically and said that my parents were tormenting them,
    <br>that the prayers of my parents were disturbing them
    <br>and that they were not giving me chance to accomplish my mission in this world.
    <br>They said I should come back to the other world by dying physically.
    <br>I agreed with them and said that it wasn’t a problem.
    <br>It was a Wednesday and they told me that they would come and fetch me by 2am and I agreed.
    <br>At around 12 midnight, they came and showed me many people
    <br>in the spiritual world, many great people, waiting to welcome me back.
    <br>They had cooked and everybody was at the party dancing.
    <br>I too was happy because I wanted to go back.
    <br>What really happened was that when I sat down, something told me, 'Victoria, what is wrong with you?
    <br>You have good parents, a caring mother and father.
    <br>Why don't you tell them that you are going, so that they can say goodbye?'
    <br>I agreed and thought that it wouldn’t be good for my parents to wake up in the morning and find my body.
    <br>They wouldn’t know where I went and would cry. My parents have been good.
    <br>For those out there who give birth to children and do not care about them,
    <br>if you really love and care for them, before they do anything, they'd tell you.
    <br>That was how I was led and went to my dad's room and knocked, my dad woke up and came out.
    <br>I asked him whether he knew that I loved him, he said that he did and that he also loved me.
    <br>I said, "Daddy, I am going back to where I belong."
    <br>My daddy asked me where I belonged to and I told him that by 2am,
    <br>I was going back and he would not see me again but I would miss everybody - goodbye.
    <br>My dad was surprised and said he had married my mum in 1984
    <br>I was born in 1985 and he did not go anywhere to ask for a child
    <br>but that God had given me to them and that I did not belong anywhere else.
    <br>I then walked out on my dad.
    <br>My mum woke up, was annoyed, tied her wrapper and went to the church.
    <br>She walked up and down the church altar praying, I just looked at her and laughed.
    <br>My dad called his friends, pastors and prayer warriors.
    <br>They came and prayed for me but I laughed at them.
    <br>Actually that day, I died and did not know what was happening physically anymore.
    <br>When I got to the other world, they welcomed me, danced with me and everyone was happy with me.
    <br>I saw many great people I knew physically and also many other people did not know.
    <br>I saw many structures there.
    <br>Some people were half fish half human, while others were half snake half human.
    <br>Some were half crab half human. They welcomed me and we danced.
    <br>All of a sudden, the goddess screamed, "What is happening in my kingdom?"
    <br>She said, "Fire!" and called me saying, "Queen Vicky!"
    <br>I replied, "Yes, my goddess".
    <br>She said, "Can you see what your parents are doing to us?"
    <br>They opened my eyes and I could see my dad, mum and many other people firing prayer.
    <br>There was fire everywhere.
    <br>They took a cane, flogged me and asked to go back.
    <br>That was how I came back. I saw my mummy, daddy and everyone crying and praying.
    <br>I came back to life.
    <br>What was the condition you were given on this earth that you must not do?
    <br>OK. After I came back, they told me that in that world I came to, I was married to a great person.
    <br>No man on earth, no mortal man is on the same level. No man wants to marry me.
    <br>At the age of 22 years, I would become a billionaire.
    <br>I will be rich and if I want to have kids, I can have kids
    <br>but I would never have a crown which means no man would be my husband;
    <br>that is, an earthly husband because I already had a husband there.
    <br>I said that there was no problem.
    <br>Suitors were coming for me but my parents said they wanted me to go to a higher institution,
    <br>they didn’t want me to marry.
    <br>As young as I was, suitors were coming.
    <br>Because my parents didn’t like it, I didn’t care.
    <br>That was how things had been going.
    <br>When I entered school, suitors started coming; everybody wanted to marry me.
    <br>My people advised my parents that I should marry and still go to school.
    <br>So, that was how I fell in love with somebody.
    <br>When I married this man…
    <br>On the day of my traditional wedding, all of them came and sat down.
    <br>They said, "Queen Vicky, we will show you" but I kept quiet,
    <br>"We will show you". I kept quiet.
    <br>If I danced, they would talk and I would stop dancing and be quiet.
    <br>Nobody knew what was wrong with me.
    <br>When I entered the marriage, they struck.
    <br>They entered through my husband and started tormenting me.
    <br>When I was pregnant, this man would always beat me.
    <br>There was no month I was not admitted to the hospital.
    <br>He would always beat me.
    <br>It was the grace of God that I delivered the child.
    <br>Two weeks after I had delivered my baby, he continued to beat me.
    <br>In the end, they scattered the marriage.
    <br>I left the marriage and went back to my parents.
    <br>I gave my baby to my parents and went back to school.
    <br>I'm sorry, madam. When your husband was beating you, what were you seeing spiritually at that moment,
    <br>as the force behind him beating you?
    <br>Actually, I knew they were the ones doing it
    <br>but because I had gotten married, I had disconnected.
    <br>I still belonged but I couldn’t see anything.
    <br>They blinded my eyes, that was the punishment.
    <br>I didn’t see them but I knew that I was going there but they blinded my eyes.
    <br>What was the reaction of your husband, after he'd beaten you? How he would now feel?
    <br>The funny thing was that anytime my husband finished beating me,
    <br>if he saw any wound on my body, he would ask, "What have I done?"
    <br>He would start begging me and crying.
    <br>He would say, "I don’t know what came over me, it's like something entered me".
    <br>That was how I would believe him until the marriage broke up.
    <br>We can understand from our sister that because she broke the covenants,
    <br>when she got married to her husband, the spiritual forces from the marine world would enter him
    <br>to be beating her up physically.
    <br>After committing the act, he would immediately recover himself and wouldn't know
    <br>how he had been so violent to his wife.
    <br>This is a very important lesson for all of us, especially those of us who may be experiencing such
    <br>in our homes, to know that many times there are spirits involved is such activities.
    <br>Madam, you said that you broke up with your husband.
    <br>What eventually happened that you were able to reconnect with the marine world?
    <br>After I broke up, I went back to school and started praying again
    <br>but they were not happy so they attacked my son. They gave me many punishments.
    <br>When I finished school, they destroyed my certificate. Frustration everywhere.
    <br>I couldn’t concentrate and felt like dying.
    <br>One day, I went to a river and wanted to jump inside.
    <br>I said, "OK, come and take me, I want to come back. Why should you frustrate me?"
    <br>So, someone called me back.
    <br>After that, I met a friend who said he wanted to take me to a place, to a spiritualist.
    <br>When we got there, the spiritualist asked me if I didn't know whom I was.
    <br>I said, "I am who I am".
    <br>He told me that I shouldn't lie or pretend because I knew whom I was very well.
    <br>He said that the people what were supposed to protect me,
    <br>that my parents had chased them away and that my prayers chased them away.
    <br>He then said I would never have peace until I called them and begged them.
    <br>I asked how I would do it because I was already frustrated because I had no job
    <br>and I didn't want to involve myself in prostitution or in stealing.
    <br>Then, the spiritualist gave me a list of things to buy and that I should all those things take to the beach.
    <br>So, I bought the things and took them to the beach.
    <br>At the beach, I knelt down, begged them and reconciled with them.
    <br>When I slept in the night, I saw myself in their midst.
    <br>They said they had opened my eyes, that I would see everything.
    <br>Five months later, they said they wanted to initiate me as the queen mother, of the whole Africa.
    <br>So, they initiated me, crowned me and gave me powers.
    <br>They gave me double powers in my eyes.
    <br>I could be here and see what was happening in Ghana because I ruled as overall.
    <br>I had to monitor all the countries to see what was happening.
    <br>They gave me powers in my eyes, mouth and hips.
    <br>They gave me the power to give people wealth.
    <br>They gave me the power to give people children.
    <br>OK, madam. We want to take it step by step.
    <br>When you became the queen mother, as you said in the spiritual world, you mentioned you were given
    <br>some specific powers - we just want you to say them one by one.
    <br>You mentioned first of all that you were able to give people wealth.
    <br>Can you explain exactly how you would go about that in this physical world.
    <br>I could actually give people wealth.
    <br>Actually, I would command, I wouldn't go for work.
    <br>I had queens, kings and people under me.
    <br>I would just give the command and they would do it.
    <br>I even dated someone that I gave wealth.
    <br>My queens would bring their boyfriends and husbands for wealth.
    <br>If we gave you wealth, we would give you our rules and regulations.
    <br>Our rules said that you can be a millionaire or billionaire
    <br>but you were not allowed to give our money to charities, motherless homes or to pastors.
    <br>You were not allowed to use the money to pay tithes.
    <br>Even if you mother is a child of God, you couldn’t give her,
    <br>neither your father or your younger ones, if they served God.
    <br>As far as they believed in God, you couldn’t give them.
    <br>Even if your mother was suffering, wearing slippers
    <br>and picking from the garbage, you shouldn’t give to your mother.
    <br>Any day you would do it, it is death.
    <br>If you came to us and said you needed wealth, we'd say, "No problem".
    <br>If your girlfriend or wife came to our kingdom saying you needed wealth,
    <br>we would tell the person to wear white when they want to sleep in the night
    <br>because white is the symbol of the marine.
    <br>Everything you would wear would be white and then, you would sleep.
    <br>At the midnight, your spirit would then come to us and we would baptise you with blood.
    <br>How we got that blood was from the disobedient disciples.
    <br>Like me, they told me not to marry but I went and got married.
    <br>If not for the family I came from, they would have used my blood.
    <br>Let me just say that God is merciful.
    <br>That was the kind of blood we would use.
    <br>Any time you disobeyed us, we would kill you and your blood would be there.
    <br>OK. Our sister is explaining that the spiritual kingdom of darkness, the marine world had the power to give wealth
    <br>but conditions were attached, that such money could not be given to any church,
    <br>to any Christian, or for any form of charity.
    <br>Madam, those millionaires that were enriched by your kingdom, what would they be spending their money on?
    <br>Since you couldn’t spend your money on anything that belonged to God,
    <br>you could use it at the night clubs, give it to girls, use it to smoke and drink and do your normal business.
    <br>You were not allowed to use the money for good things.
    <br>You also mentioned you had the power to give children.
    <br>Can you explain more about this?
    <br>Yes, we gave children because in the marine world, if you came there,
    <br>we have different children – we have fish, snakes, crabs, pythons,
    <br>we have different animals that live in the sea and symbolise the spirits of the marine.
    <br>If anyone comes to us and says that they needed a child, no problem, we would give them.
    <br>We would send a fish or a snake to enter into the person's womb.
    <br>So, you will give birth but the child will definitely kill you
    <br>or give you problems and you would develop a heart attack.
    <br>That is why, you see some people during deliverances saying that they are a snake or fish.
    <br>People of God, I hope we are listening to our sister.
    <br>We are really learning a lot from what she is saying.
    <br>This is someone who has a practical experience as someone who was part of that kingdom.
    <br>Now madam, do you mean to say that in this physical world, when you look around
    <br>because your spiritual eyes were opened, you were able to see those who were part of your kingdom?
    <br>Tell us about the kind of things you see, for an example; if you see people who are Christians -
    <br>what identifies them as a Christian, or those who are just claiming to be Christians?
    <br>Actually, with my own experience...
    <br>I had the power that wherever I went in this world,
    <br>anybody who had the spirit of marine, immediately I saw you, I would know.
    <br>Anybody who is a child of God, immediately I saw you, I would know.
    <br>Anyone who is a lukewarm Christian, immediately I saw you, I would know.
    <br>Anyone who is a bench warmer, immediately I saw you, I would know.
    <br>They all have a sign. Like the children of God, a born-again Christian,
    <br>the light is here and is very red. That is the sign of a real born-again Christian.
    <br>The sign of a marine would be here and would be very white like a star.
    <br>When I saw it, I would know that the person was our member.
    <br>A lukewarm Christian, the light would be there but it would be very small,
    <br>like a light that wants to die or quench.
    <br>A bench warmer would just be there and is a very easy meat to eat.
    <br>Those bench warmers and lukewarm Christians - you were able to attack them very easily?
    <br>Yes, and the lukewarm Christians.
    <br>You mentioned specific powers you had in your eyes, your hips, your mouth.
    <br>Can you explain how you used those powers.
    <br>They put something in my body whereas I don’t love men.
    <br>Men love me. I don’t love.
    <br>I used the power in my eyes since they crowned me the queen mother.
    <br>I didn’t lust after men; I had girls that did that, it wasn’t my business.
    <br>I used the power in my eyes to control the whole Africa and to check what was happening everywhere.
    <br>The power in my mouth was authority – anything I said, would happen.
    <br>OK. Now madam, can you tell us, from your experience, what can you say about the state of the world
    <br>we are living in right now, compared to the amount of people who are under this bondage.
    <br>I would say because I know the signs...
    <br>Many people would be possessed and they would not know, while some people would know.
    <br>I knew my own very well.
    <br>Some people would not know; they are ignorant.
    <br>I am very sure that Christians should tighten their belts because if the rapture should place today,
    <br>I don't know about that...
    <br>OK. Our sister is saying that many people are possessed but they don't know about it
    <br>because they are under that bondage without knowing about it, and that is the reason why
    <br>we are listening to this experience to open our eyes.
    <br>One more question, madam.
    <br>What can you say concerning...
    <br>If you look at this world and you say that majority of people are under this bondage,
    <br>what specific things did the marine kingdom introduce to this world as a means of initiating people
    <br>so that others can learn from this?
    <br>We have many things we produce. The marine world is a world of beauty.
    <br>It is a world of fashion.
    <br>We produce hair attachments, earrings, gold, clothes and flashy things.
    <br>I am not saying that every hair attachment is from the marine kingdom
    <br>but anything fashionable that will come to this world we will produce it first.
    <br>We bring out the samples. We have some of our agents here;
    <br>they will produce it, while some people are not agents but they just produce.
    <br>When you buy, for example, the sample of the hair attachment we brought
    <br>and you do not pray in the name and blood of Jesus -
    <br>it is good if you buy anything from the market, before you use it, to pray over it.
    <br>If you pray over it, the power on it spoils but if you do not pray over it and wear it,
    <br>you will start seeing yourself in the night eating or swimming in your dreams with strange faces.
    <br>Hair attachments, makeup, earrings, jewellery, clothes – fashion.
    <br>The way we enter through clothing is for example, a lady who did not have the spirit of lust before,
    <br>she would notice that she went to the market and bought clothes
    <br>and started feeling attraction when seeing a man
    <br>who did not even talk to her. She would start thinking of rubbish.
    <br>Immediately you wear those clothes, all over your body is written, 'lust'.
    <br>Men would begin to pursue you.
    <br>That is why you would see some people ending up prostituting and it is not their fault.
    <br>They don’t know the power behind it. You cannot blame them.
    <br>OK. People of God, our sister has said so much and we want everyone to take your lesson
    <br>from what she is saying. She made a very important point that any time you get something, you must pray
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ, in the blood of Jesus Christ before simply wearing it or putting it on.
    <br>I believe this message will help us to cultivate consciousness
    <br>in all that we are doing of God's presence.
    <br>Sister, we want you to tell us how you came to The SCOAN. What brought you here?
    <br>What brought me to The SCOAN was that my frustration was too much because I had broken their covenant.
    <br>They said I should not get married; I got married and at the end, they scattered the marriage.
    <br>There are many covenants people make and they don’t know.
    <br>You would see a young girl who is very charming,
    <br>she has kids and is a billionaire but has no husband.
    <br>It is a covenant.
    <br>There are many covenants.
    <br>Somebody who just got married and it is not up to a year before she dies;
    <br>it is a covenant. She had made a covenant.
    <br>There are plenty covenants like that.
    <br>Because I broke their covenant, they started to frustrate my life.
    <br>I went to school but they scattered my documents.
    <br>I had nothing to present.
    <br>I was frustrated.
    <br>They started making people to hate and frustrate me. Frustration was everywhere.
    <br>Apart from these challenges you were facing personally, in the kingdom you were in as a queen mother -
    <br>what was the effect that The SCOAN and the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua was having
    <br>on those who were part of your kingdom?
    <br>I really needed deliverance but I came to The SCOAN with two missions.
    <br>I came to be delivered. I knew that I needed deliverance.
    <br>There was fire on the mountain. My kingdom was shaking.
    <br>I was losing members every day. That was why I came.
    <br>A friend invited me to come here for deliverance and I came.
    <br>The day I came, I saw everything that was happening.
    <br>This one was saying, “I am a snake”. This one was saying, “I am a fish”.
    <br>I was thinking that it was arrant nonsense and an insult.
    <br>I was thinking, “Why should I stay here while all these children are saying,
    <br>‘I am a snake. I am a fish. I am this’.”
    <br>I became furious in my spirit; I was angry. I went home that day.
    <br>When the wise men came and touched me, I just looked at them.
    <br>I left.
    <br>When I came back another day, I knew that I needed deliverance
    <br>but when that spirit came, it would back me up.
    <br>The wise man came and touched me; I was calm.
    <br>He went away.
    <br>My people said to me, “Queen mother, this is an insult. Why should this little boy touch your crown?"
    <br>So, I became annoyed.
    <br>That day, I was supposed to come back to this place but I went to my friend's place and slept there.
    <br>The following day, we would come to the church.
    <br>When I slept, I went to the marine kingdom and
    <br>saw many of my fish, snakes and crabs were dead; I had lost members.
    <br>I was annoyed. I came back to life.
    <br>You mean that those who had come to The SCOAN for deliverance, spiritually you would see that your fish
    <br>and snakes in your kingdom had died because the person had come and received deliverance?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>If anyone comes to The SCOAN and is delivered, that spirit that is the fish would be dead in our kingdom.
    <br>That is how we would know that they have arrested one of our members.
    <br>We can really see the work of God here in The SCOAN. We give glory to God.
    <br>Finally madam, we know that you came and we saw how you were prayed for,
    <br>tell us what happened when you were prayed for by Wise Man Daniel.
    <br>That day, I just woke up and went to meet my friend where he was lying down.
    <br>I said, “I want to see T.B. Joshua”.
    <br>He asked me, “For what?”
    <br>I said, “If you don’t show me, I will kill you now”.
    <br>I said that I would kill him and his blood would represent for his prophet.
    <br>He said that he did not know anything but that he is hiding under his umbrella.
    <br>I said, "Under his umbrella. Connect me, I want to talk to him".
    <br>That was how he linked me. I called and somebody picked up the call.
    <br>I said, "Please, I want to speak to the Prophet".
    <br>The person said that I could not talk to the Prophet but I could give him the message.
    <br>I gave my message.
    <br>Later, the person called me and said that the man of God said that I should come the following morning.
    <br>That was how I came.
    <br>We can see on the screen how our sister was receiving her deliverance.
    <br>She said she made a phone call. As many of us may remember, during the deliverance the evil spirit said that
    <br>they called, she called the prayer line and she came.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for the wonderful deliverance that took place.
    <br>When I came and he called me, I wanted to fight but I found that I could not fight.
    <br>There was fire all over my body – my palms, legs, everywhere.
    <br>I did not believe there was something like deliverance because I had gone to many places for deliverance
    <br>and many men of God and at the end, they would turn and befriend me.
    <br>They would start asking me out.
    <br>Some of them would tell me to bring 50,000 or 10,000 naira and I was somebody who did not have a job.
    <br>I concluded that there were no genuine men of God, that church business was business.
    <br>It was in The SCOAN that I knew that there is still deliverance,
    <br>that some men of God still have the power of God in them.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Glory to God.
    <br>Finally madam, now that you are delivered, what are the changes in your life?
    <br>How have you been sleeping since your deliverance? What can you say?
    <br>Before I was delivered, I could sit here and see all over the world.
    <br>That day I sat, I could not see anything.
    <br>No more eating in my dreams or swimming and no more crown.
    <br>I am happy. When I sleep, I sleep and wake up normal.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Finally, now that you are delivered, what is your advice to viewers around the world watching you right now,
    <br>about what Jesus Christ can do in people's lives?
    <br>My advice goes to ladies out there
    <br>who are not content with what they have or what their husbands give them.
    <br>They would see another person and want to be like that person
    <br>but you don’t know the kind of spirit that possesses that person.
    <br>You say in school, "Please, can you lend me that thing?"
    <br>When you take and wear it, you are already possessed.
    <br>I want to advise women all over the world to be content with what they have.
    <br>For women who are looking for the fruit of the womb,
    <br>don’t go to any spiritualist who will take you to a river and give you a child.
    <br>They would say they want to baptise you
    <br>but they are initiating you and also the child they would give you.
    <br>At the end, that child will bring hypertension to you or kill you.
    <br>Wait for the time of the Lord.
    <br>It is God who gives children who will not give you sorrow.
    <br>There is no other power. The devil does not have power to give children.
    <br>Everything that the devil gives is fake.
    <br>It is only God that gives original things.
    <br>And for men...
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
