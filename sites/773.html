    <br>Please, Father, heal me!
    <br>I had an accident and my arm and leg were affected.
    <br>Because I don't have any cartilage in my knee, whenever I walk, it is so painful.
    <br>I cannot walk!
    <br>Please, heal me!
    <br>I want to run; please, heal me!

    <br>SOUTH KOREA CRUSADE WITH T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Lee Hyun Ju - Deajeon, South Korea
    <br>Good morning. My name is Lee Hyun Ju. I am from Deajeon in South Korea.
    <br>One and a half years ago, I had an accident.
    <br>I sustained a fracture in my right leg and shoulder.
    <br>Unfortunately, I had an operation.
    <br>During the operation, I had iron rods inserted
    <br>and after one year, they were removed by another operation.
    <br>During my rehabilitation, the doctors discovered that I had no cartilage in my right knee.
    <br>The doctor told me that due to the inflammation, I could develop severe rheumatism.
    <br>The rehabilitation did not solve the problem.
    <br>It greatly affected my daily activities.
    <br>About one and a half years ago, I had a severe accident.
    <br>Because of that, I had to undergo an operation.
    <br>I went for rehabilitation because I was experiencing severe pain and I had no other choice.
    <br>Even though I went for rehabilitation, the pain remained the same and I also then experienced other problems.
    <br>So, I went to the doctor again, and he told me that there were more problems.
    <br>The doctor said that due to the inflammation, I was a hundred percent likely to develop rheumatism.
    <br>The doctor told me that I would suffer from rheumatism.

    <br>Due to the accident, I had a fracture to my right leg and shoulder.
    <br>The doctor said that the joints of my right leg had been seriously shattered.
    <br>It really affected my daily activities.
    <br>I received the promise of God concerning my problem, through this crusade.
    <br>So, I came to this crusade.
    <br>It is for more than one and a half years that I suffered from this pain.
    <br>Because of this pain, I could not walk or stand for a long time.
    <br>There were a lot of problems in my daily life.
    <br>Because I could not walk, I could not go out.
    <br>I needed somebody to help me. My condition caused me to become depressed.
    <br>Without the assistance of my family members, I could not do anything.
    <br>Basically, I could not walk or stand for a long time.
    <br>Therefore, I could not go out very often.
    <br>Because of the pain, without the help of my family, I could not walk, stand or go somewhere.
    <br>Because I had a problem with my arm, I could not work.
    <br>Especially when I am working, I make a lot of use of my arms.
    <br>But because of this accident, I had to quit my job.
    <br>I went to several hospitals in search of a solution.
    <br>I also went to church and prayed without the belief that I could receive healing.
    <br>First of all, I went to the hospital and I also went to church and prayed
    <br>but I didn't think that it would really help me.
    <br>The doctor told me to avoid using my knees
    <br>and that I should wear the recommended leg brace.
    <br>Because of the severe pain, the doctor told me to use the knee brace.
    <br>When she came to the crusade, tell us what actually happened. What took place?
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>I had the confidence and faith that God would heal me this time.
    <br>I had the faith that God would heal me.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for me, I felt the light of the Holy Spirit touch my whole body.
    <br>I asked myself, "What is this?" After that, Prophet T.B. Joshua told me to stand up and walk
    <br>and because I had faith, I received healing from God; I started to run!
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua came to me and touched my body, I felt like a lightning coming through my body
    <br>and when he told me to walk and run, I had the faith that I could then run
    <br>so as you see in the video, I was able to run.
    <br>Indeed we saw you running to the glory of God, after the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and you are here today standing without your brace and without any walking aid.
    <br>How are you feeling now?
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Now, I am very well. I have no doubts about the healing I have received.
    <br>Now,  I no longer need the leg brace and can move around freely.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Right now, I feel very good.
    <br>Also, as you can see, I don't need my leg brace anymore.
    <br>I also have the faith that this healing will remain forever.
    <br>I can now do a lot of things that I could not do before.
    <br>Amen! Glory be to God!
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>And there you can see her jogging - doing what she could not do before.
    <br>We would like you to walk in the midst of the children of God.
    <br>Just walk and show us that you are now healed to the glory of God.
    <br>There you can see her walking -
    <br>doing what she could not do before!
    <br>That is healing in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>She is here today without her brace, which is a clear evidence and proof
    <br>that Jesus Christ has healed her completely and effectually!
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>You should not have an ounce of doubt that God can heal you.
    <br>Yesterday at the crusade, before the prayer, I said, "God, thank You for healing me".
    <br>Jesus heard my prayer and responded to me by providing my complete healing.
    <br>So, you too, don't lose hope; thank God for your healing before you even receive it.
    <br>South Korea Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua - Testimony Time
    <br>Praise the Lord! I want to tell you that you should not have doubt.
    <br>I already told God, "Thank You, Jesus, for healing me" before my healing.
    <br>If you have faith that God will heal you, then, you will be healed
    <br>If you are afraid of whether you will be healed, just tell God, "Thank You, Jesus, that you have healed me".
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
