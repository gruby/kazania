    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>How are you?
    <br>God wants to use you.
    <br>I'm a bishop, sir.
    <br>- You are a bishop?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- Clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>- I am blessed, sir.
    <br>What shows that you are a pastor, for the man of God to say, "God wants to use you"?
    <br>Everybody shout, "Hallelujah!"
    <br>God wants to use you but the hindrance you are having now is your home -
    <br>your family - your wife.
    <br>Your home needs to come together so that they will understand your calling.
    <br>That is true, sir.
    <br>That is what we have been discussing, right from Edo State.
    <br>That is why we are here.
    <br>For more than twenty years, we have been on this issue.
    <br>The family, everything is disorganised.
    <br>I started deliverance, as far as Bendel State is concerned...
    <br>I am nowhere to be found nowadays.
    <br>Go and wait for me.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>I want everybody to shout, "Hallelujah" once again!
    <br>Glory be to God in the highest that I am with you today.
    <br>My name is Bishop Famous Erebholu.
    <br>Christ United Faith Ministry is my ministry.
    <br>The woman beside me is my wife and my children are with me.
    <br>My wife is Pastor Reverend Mrs Rosemary Erebholu.
    <br>While my son is bearing my name, Famous Junior Erebholu,
    <br>the other is Blessing Erebholu.
    <br>While this boy is Gladness Erebholu.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I came to this church last Sunday for the first time.
    <br>On Monday, I was very surprised that where I was sitting,
    <br>the man of God met me face to face.
    <br>He told me that God wanted to use me.
    <br>I quickly replied to him saying, "Yes, I am a bishop."
    <br>He told me that the problems I have now are my family, home and my wife.
    <br>I saw that it was a true prophecy.
    <br>Right from the beginning, I have been battling with this matter
    <br>because I have been in ministry for about 30 years now.
    <br>I discovered that there was problem everywhere in my life, family and even in my wife's hands.
    <br>To God be the glory, this is my wife with me here now; I am married.
    <br>We wedded in 1993.
    <br>The wedding was so tough, after 6 days of marriage,
    <br>I was surprised, there were problems everywhere.
    <br>She had problems everywhere then, she packed her load and left the house.
    <br>I was in the village, we were fasting and praying.
    <br>She walked in, after tracing me to that place,
    <br>I didn't know what had happened,
    <br>she entered the church where I was and gave me four wonderful slaps.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>My wife here gave me those four slaps.
    <br>My face changed, I was seeing Heaven not hell.
    <br>It is a thing you are laughing about but it was a problem.
    <br>From that day, I didn't know what to do, I was perplexed.
    <br>After the first slap why couldn't you run, sir?
    <br>Well I felt that if I ran, I would become a crazy man by force.
    <br>With that, she left my place until about the end of 1994
    <br>before I was able to bring her back.
    <br>Then things started again, there were problems everywhere.
    <br>If somebody told her, "There is dirt on the ground, let me help you clean it,"
    <br>it would become a problem in the house; she would begin to fight me.
    <br>We were fighting every day continually.
    <br>Generally, we were fighting
    <br>until there was a night that she drove me out of the house; I ran away.
    <br>My brother...
    <br>Who drove you away, sir?
    <br>It was my wife, sir.
    <br>- Your wife?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- You remember the prophecy I gave here?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>When I met you, I said that God wanted to use you mightily
    <br>but your wife, your home - there is trouble.
    <br>Can you clap for Jesus Christ?
    <br>Why should any man of God run from a man of God?
    <br>We can revive ourselves.
    <br>God will not come down to revive us.
    <br>It is we, ministers of God, that should revive ourselves, because there is trouble in churches all over.
    <br>Everywhere, even in the house of God there is trouble,
    <br>but we can revive ourselves.
    <br>I will use the gift given to me revive others; another one will help me.
    <br>Let's revive ourselves.
    <br>Let the church come together.
    <br>Until one day, the church gathered and said that these things were bad;
    <br>that it was not good that every day there was fighting in the pastor's house.
    <br>There was a war between her and the church.
    <br>The church gathered together and were telling others that came together.
    <br>They said, "Let us see what is happening."
    <br>They called us in the church, judged the matter and discovered that she offended me in every way.
    <br>They told her that I should divorce her that day.
    <br>They all said that I should divorce her but I said that I could not divorce her.
    <br>I said, "If I divorce this woman, it will be a reproach;
    <br>and this will be a problem to Christ's Kingdom.
    <br>I remember the vow I took on the altar on the day of my wedding."
    <br>A time came when I discovered that the problem was too much
    <br>that I could not bear it that I called her and said,
    <br>"Look, because of this, I don't know what to do."
    <br>What was the other problem, sir.
    <br>The other problem was that we were fighting still, sir.
    <br>She was still fighting you?
    <br>Daily, we didn't rest; to the extent that I didn't stay at home in the afternoon.
    <br>I told her one day, "Mama, you are my mama; you are my wife, listen:
    <br>You become the man of the house so that I will become the woman."
    <br>Because the beating was too terrible.
    <br>- For you?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>- So, she used to beat you, sir?
    <br>- Very well, sir.
    <br>We were fighting every day.
    <br>One of those days, I called her and said, "Look Mama, I don't know why these things are happening."
    <br>She opened her mouth and told me that she didn't know when these things were happening.
    <br>Sir, can I ask you a question?
    <br>When you told my mum that you should become man and she should become woman at home,
    <br>what did she say?
    <br>She agreed; she kept quiet and didn't argue.
    <br>And she started acting like a man?
    <br>So that there would be no problem at home.
    <br>Well, I cannot really narrate all
    <br>but all I know, glory be to God in the highest
    <br>who brought me into this church last Sunday.
    <br>OK, let's hear from mama.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Reverend Mrs Rosemary Erebholu.
    <br>Last week Monday, my husband was here
    <br>and the man of God called him out.
    <br>He said that there was a division in his family,
    <br>that his wife and children needed to know his calling.
    <br>The following day, the man of God asked him to call us and we came here.
    <br>Yes or no - is it true what he was saying about you?
    <br>It is not all of it that is true.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>So, mama and my father, we will go for deliverance now.
    <br>We will pray together and after the deliverance, we can now talk.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Wow, what a beautiful couple.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>Aren't you seeing a beautiful couple?
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>Praise the Lord Hallelujah
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>I am very happy this morning to be in your midst once again.
    <br>I discovered that God is in this place.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>My name is Bishop Famous Erebholu.
    <br>I am standing here again with my family,
    <br>Reverend Mrs Rosemary Erebholu and my children.
    <br>I discovered that something happened to me here last Sunday in a good way.
    <br>The man of God placed us on the prayer line.
    <br>By the grace of God, we underwent prayers for deliverance
    <br>and so many things happened.
    <br>After the deliverance, I discovered a new thing entirely in my wife's life.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>I want to tell the whole world that I was looking at her
    <br>as an ordinary woman in the street.
    <br>From Monday till today, I have been seeing her as my wife.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>Thirdly, never in my life have I touched her like this because I was scared.
    <br>So many things had happened.
    <br>But from that day till now, I can play with her; I can talk to her.
    <br>Let me tell you...
    <br>You say what, sir?
    <br>I want to tell you that I had not been seeing what I am seeing now.
    <br>I had never one day held her and said, "My wife!"
    <br>I saw her very far away from me.
    <br>Do you know that from that day I can hug her, I can kiss her, I can play with her!
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>Oh, thank you.
    <br>Can you see the woman; she is on her knees.
    <br>I want to tell the whole world that today is my wedding day again!
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>I have wedded a new wife!
    <br>OK, can you raise up and sing a wedding song?
    <br>This is the day
    <br>That the Lord has made
    <br>I will rejoice
    <br>And be glad in it
    <br>This is the day that the Lord has made
    <br>I will rejoice and be glad in it
    <br>This is the day
    <br>Another day that the Lord has made
    <br>We are married today
    <br>Tomorrow no more
    <br>You are married today
    <br>You are married forever
    <br>You are married today
    <br>Tomorrow no more
    <br>You are married today
    <br>You are married forever
    <br>You are married today
    <br>Tomorrow no more
    <br>You are married today
    <br>You are married forever
    <br>You are married today
    <br>Tomorrow no more
    <br>You are married today
    <br>You are married forever
    <br>You are married today
    <br>Tomorrow no more
    <br>You are married today
    <br>You are married forever
    <br>You are married today
    <br>Tomorrow no more
    <br>You are married today
    <br>You are married forever
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>What God has joined together
    <br>Let no man put asunder
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>What God has joined together
    <br>Let no man put asunder
    <br>You are the Lord
    <br>That is Your name
    <br>You will never share Your glory with anyone
    <br>You will never share Your glory with anybody
    <br>Almighty God that is Your name
    <br>You are the Lord
    <br>That is Your name
    <br>You will never share Your glory with anyone
    <br>You will never share Your glory with anybody
    <br>Almighty God that is Your name
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Even the little boy knows the joy that the Lord has restored.
    <br>He is laughing.
    <br>Glory be to God. You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>You have listened to that.
    <br>This was a broken home for many years.
    <br>Can you see the importance of the prophetic ministry?
    <br>If not for the prophecy given to this man,
    <br>it would have been difficult for him to open up
    <br>and to stand and say, "I am a Bishop" in the congregation.
    <br>It takes the grace of God.
    <br>This is why everyone of us has to open our hearts.
    <br>Today, we have in the service more that 500 people
    <br>that while they were sleeping they saw in the vision someone looking like T.B. Joshua,
    <br>telling them what they needed to do.
    <br>Prophecy given to them in a vision.
    <br>We want to congratulate our Bishop.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Praise Master Jesus!
    <br>Everybody, help me to thank God.
    <br>The Lord is good!
    <br>My name is Mrs Rosemary Erebholu.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>All the while, we had been quarrelling and fighting.
    <br>I'd been cursing my husband, fighting him, doing one thing or the other
    <br>but the prophecy the man of God gave helped our family.
    <br>The prophecy brought healing, deliverance and a miracle to our family today.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So, from each aspect - let me answer so that I will not forget,
    <br>because after you finish talking, I may not talk about that.
    <br>When the prophet calls you and gives a prophecy, it like a man that says,
    <br>"Brother, someone owes you 30 million dollars.
    <br>For many years they did not pay you.
    <br>They will pay you.
    <br>Don't worry."
    <br>90 or 99 per cent of people I prophecy for, don't need any other deliverance.
    <br>Prophecy contains deliverance.
    <br>Prophecy contains healing.
    <br>Prophecy contains prayer.
    <br>It may be that only 1-2 per cent of people that will be arranged for prayer.
    <br>OK, let's hear from you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>What my husband said last Sunday was true.
    <br>I did it out of ignorance.
    <br>I am pleading now that my husband should forgive me.
    <br>I have forgiven you already.
    <br>Thank you, bishop.
    <br>I want to be a part of your family too.
    <br>Your ministry too - let's talk.
    <br>Two believers are better than one.
    <br>You have listened to the message I gave in the morning.
    <br>That you are a pastor does not mean you cannot make a mistake.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>People make mistakes - tell your neighbour -
    <br>even if you are a Christian,
    <br>even if you are a pastor.
    <br>People make mistakes.
    <br>Our mistake is different from others.
    <br>Can you see the mistake I am talking about?
    <br>Look what their own mistake led them to - to know T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Instead of that mistake to separate their home finally, beyond repair...
    <br>But now...
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>So when you have a situation, that situation is not meant to kill you.
    <br>It would be too soon to begin to murmur, "Why should I have this trouble?
    <br>I am a Christian. I fast, I go to church, I watch and I pray.
    <br>Look at my friends. They are not going to church, they are not Christians,
    <br>they don't have this problem, but me - a Christian. Why?"
    <br>T.B. Joshua is telling you: That situation will prepare you for the extraordinary.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Bishop and my mummy - I want to congratulate you and the family and our children too.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>I will give you a handshake later.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I am using this opportunity to thank you for all that you have done for us.
    <br>I am still pleading for you to help us.
    <br>Since we had been fighting and quarrelling,
    <br>there is nothing to write home about us.
    <br>We need your help, sir.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Do you know the reason why I did not give a handshake?
    <br>I want to have a meeting with you - and maintenance of what you have received today.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>When you get home, you come together and you want to celebrate - no.
    <br>Stay with God, fast and pray.
    <br>The two of you should go into a closet for 3 days - fasting.
    <br>You want to renew, rededicate your life.
    <br>Receive revelation from God, not from man.
    <br>That is the meeting I want to have with you.
    <br>Trust in the authority of God, more than the majority of people.
    <br>This is my message to our bishop.
    <br>Thank you, bishop.
    <br>TOUCHING: Watch God Reconcile This BROKEN HOME!!!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Bless the name of the Lord.
    <br>My name is Bishop Erebholu and this is my family.
    <br>We are very happy for what the Lord God has done for us.
    <br>The first day I came to this ministry, the man of God located me.
    <br>I was very happy.
    <br>The prophecy was very true.
    <br>I discovered that it was God who sent me here.
    <br>Today, we are happy.
    <br>Can you just, to the glory of God, briefly tell us some of the challenges you were facing in your marriage,
    <br>before you came here and how it really affected the ministry?
    <br>My ministry collapsed.
    <br>If people came one day, the next day, they would not come.
    <br>We built a church and are unable to roof it.
    <br>It really affected my ministry.
    <br>It almost finished the ministry until God led me to this church.
    <br>Today, I am joyful; I am seeing the real dividend of Christianity in my life.
    <br>Since that day, people have been calling me, even from abroad,
    <br>telling me congratulations.
    <br>They know that victory has come.
    <br>Hallelujah. Well, this is a really wonderful testimony.
    <br>We rejoice with this family, to the glory of God.
    <br>Right now, we would like to hear a few words from your wife as well,
    <br>to really testify to what Jesus Christ has done.
    <br>My name is Rev Mrs Erebholu.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>God is here in The SCOAN.
    <br>God sent us to this place for deliverance and blessing.
    <br>God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver our family.
    <br>We came here with heaviness of heart but when T.B. Joshua prayed for us,
    <br>God removed that heaviness and lightened our hearts.
    <br>Today, we are rejoicing.
    <br>Praise Master Jesus!
    <br>You mentioned earlier that before, you were a flourishing bishop
    <br>but as a result of these challenges you were facing,
    <br>your ministry had really been suffering setback.
    <br>Can you just tell us once again:
    <br>Before coming to The SCOAN, what was the current condition of your ministry
    <br>and what had been happening?
    <br>It was really very bad; I was not happy about the condition of the ministry.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>I know, by the grace of God, miracles will happen.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>We know that God Almighty has done so much for this family
    <br>and you have received a spiritual deliverance, reconciliation and God has blessed this home.
    <br>But we know the blessing does not end there.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua said he really wants to support your ministry,
    <br>to see it restored to the position that God Almighty wants it to be.
    <br>So, he said that we should present to you with the cash gift of 200 000 naira
    <br>and 10 bags of rice, to support your family and your ministry
    <br>to start afresh, in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I am the happiest man of earth today.
    <br>Hallelujah. Once again, we rejoice with this family, in Jesus' name.
    <br>We know that this family has so much to rejoice about
    <br>with the wonderful transformation in their lives.
    <br>We would like to hear a song from the family, to the glory of God.
    <br>My sins He has taken away
    <br>My tears He has wiped away
    <br>No matter the case may be
    <br>I will never change
    <br>I will follow till He comes
    <br>My sins He has taken away
    <br>My tears He has wiped away
    <br>No matter the case may be
    <br>I will never change
    <br>I will follow till He comes
    <br>Hallelujah. Glory be to God.
    <br>We rejoice with this wonderful family.
    <br>We just want to encourage you that the best is yet to come.
    <br>We know you are going to be back here with more wonderful testimonies, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen!
