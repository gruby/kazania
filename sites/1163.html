    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua was giving an inspiring message during the SCOAN Sunday live service,
    <br>his spirit was quickly alerted that something was about to happen in the congregation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>MANIFESTATION OF EVIL SPIRITS
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I am a strong man.
    <br>MANIFESTATION OF EVIL SPIRITS
    <br>I gave her sickness.
    <br>I destroyed her.
    <br>It is time, tell your neighbor - it is time.
    <br>Through her dreams.
    <br>From her mother's side.
    <br>Back on the floor.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>See your friend, she never knew what brought her out, she is ashamed.
    <br>What are you doing there?
    <br>What happened?
    <br>You know, you wanted to fight me?
    <br>SET FREE IN JESUS' NAME
    <br>Oh God, thank you!
    <br>This is why the Bible says the One from above is above all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Do you know what happened to you?
    <br>No.
    <br>You slapped me.
    <br>No.
    <br>Let me show you where you slapped me. See.
    <br>Sorry, Prophet.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>So you are free.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We will do every proper thing to set you free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am free. 
    <br>I am delivered.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank You for planning and 
    <br>preparing this wonderful day for me.
    <br>People of God, help me to praise this Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Maria, I'm from South Africa.
    <br>The man beside me is my husband.
    <br>It all started from my childhood.
    <br>I came from a family that worships ancestors.
    <br>I grew up in my grandmother's house where my aunt was a 'sangoma',
    <br>she initiated people.
    <br>As a child growing up, I used to do what they were doing,
    <br>to dance with them, do all those kind of things they were doing.
    <br>As I was growing up like that,
    <br>I didn't like what they were doing as 'sangomas'.
    <br>Each and every year, they used to cut us and put charms in our body.
    <br>Whatever that the sangomas were doing we were also doing.
    <br>When they danced or drank those medicines, we were also drinking with them.
    <br>I was part of them because when they would come to seek for help from my aunt,
    <br>I would be the one helping my aunt bathing people.
    <br>When she cut them, I would be following my aunt
    <br>to give her the medicine to cut that person.
    <br>I started dreaming and my dreams would come to pass.
    <br>I dreamt about two snakes.
    <br>These two snakes, I used to go to the river to talk with them.
    <br>They were like my friends because I would always see myself there in the river talking to them.
    <br>They wanted me to be in the water with them.
    <br>As I grew up, I started becoming very angry;
    <br>I didn't know where this anger was coming from.
    <br>Then I didn't have forgiveness in my heart.
    <br>I tried to come out of these things of 'sangoma' because in my heart, I didn't like what they were doing.
    <br>These 'sangoma' things - I didn't like it.
    <br>I went to this known big church in South Africa.
    <br>Most of the people know this church.
    <br>When I went there, they prophesied to me.
    <br>They said I was a prophetess.
    <br>Then I started following all those instructions that they were giving to me.
    <br>I started prophesying and my prophecy was not the prophecy of...
    <br>I would say of God because it was always negative.
    <br>The prophecy would tell that someone would die or you would lose your job.
    <br>And that was true because it happened mostly.
    <br>Sometimes it would come in my dreams.
    <br>The owner of the church would come to me and tell me that
    <br>such a person would come and would be wearing such clothes
    <br>and in which direction he would be sitting.
    <br>Then I would know, he would tell me everything about that person.
    <br>Okay, you say they would come to you -
    <br>who would come to you in the dream to tell you this?
    <br>They owner of the church.
    <br>Okay, so you would see that evil spirit appear to you in the dream.
    <br>You mentioned before that you were seeing these snakes.
    <br>Would these snakes continue to appear to you at this point?
    <br>Yes, they continued coming to me, speaking with me.
    <br>So these snakes would appear to you and tell you that someone will be coming to the service,
    <br>give them a word of prophecy and the following day, when you went to that church,
    <br>you would now see that same person and give him a word of prophecy.
    <br>Yes, the outcome of these prophecies were not good
    <br>because when I dreamt of someone, I would see that person dying,
    <br>or losing his job and it would happen the way I told him,
    <br>the way I had seen it and it brought fear.
    <br>The people had fear, and they didn't have peace.
    <br>They were always afraid that something bad would happen
    <br>because of the prophecy from that place.
    <br>Can you explain how this affected you in the area of your marriage,
    <br>your relationship with your husband?
    <br>It affected me because these dreams would come -
    <br>whatever step he would be taking or something that was not good -
    <br>I would be seeing it before he knew that I knew it.
    <br>Then it would create anger in me and I would be so angry with him.
    <br> If I got angry, something bad would happen to him.
    <br>As he is self-employed, in my heart, I wished that there would be no job
    <br>or people would not pay him - then it would happen like that.
    <br>And I would be angry by then.
    <br>So when you were angry and you thought or spoke evil,
    <br>concerning your husband's business, it would come to pass.
    <br>And what about your relationship with him in terms of affection
    <br>or closeness as husband and wife?
    <br>The affection sometimes was not there.
    <br>So could you explain to us, madam,
    <br>how did you now discover The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations
    <br>and come to receive your deliverance last week?
    <br>I discovered the television station through my husband -
    <br>his friend told him about the television station.
    <br>What was it that you saw on Emmanuel TV 
    <br>that really convinced you or touched you?
    <br>The prophecies of the man of God - when he prophesies, he gives the solution.
    <br>Then I saw the teachings of the man of God, when he reads the Bible,
    <br>and I then refer to the Bible, I learn a lot.
    <br>God is alive, He is there and He delivers.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Glory be to God, so that's how you decided to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>When the man of God arrived here, I felt the fire.
    <br>I was burning, I couldn't hold myself.
    <br>I wanted to grab him.
    <br>There was this force that was busy on me.
    <br>I don't know how to explain it even today.
    <br>After my deliverance, I felt ashamed. I came back to my senses.
    <br>I didn't know what had happened.
    <br>I saw that people were just looking at me; then I felt ashamed.
    <br>God is awesome!
    <br>I feel peace in me, I don't have those bad thoughts in my mind.
    <br>I feel peace. I feel calm in my body.
    <br>And the dreams, seeing those snakes appear to you -
    <br>everything has come to an end after the deliverance?
    <br>I don't see any of those, I sleep like a baby.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We give glory to God for the wonderful deliverance our sister received.
    <br>We believe you are really in a position to advise people of God,
    <br>especially concerning the area that satan was using you in the past
    <br>to give false, fake words of prophecy to people.
    <br>What do you want to advise people of God in the light
    <br>of this deliverance that you have received?
    <br>My advice especially to the Christians:
    <br>when you are a Christian, don't play a Christian; be a real Christian.
    <br>Don't just be a church goer, listen and obey what is there.
    <br>If you don't - when someone curses you, if you don't have God,
    <br>that thing will come to pass.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Kaizer Mata.
    <br>This beautiful woman beside me is my wife.
    <br>We have been married for more 
    <br>than 15 years now.
    <br>What she was talking about is true because I know about all these things.
    <br>The evil spirit in her made her to be angry all the time.
    <br>It did all sorts of things that were not good in our marriage,
    <br>it scattered my business.
    <br>Whatever she said came to pass,
    <br>what she was saying is more than what she's explaining now.
    <br>Remember, for 15 years I have been staying with a woman
    <br>being forced by a spirit - an evil spirit.
    <br>So, a lot of things have happened.
    <br>I can't say much but what I would like to do is to thank the man of God.
    <br>I'm very happy because the evil spirit has gone.
    <br>Since she was delivered on Sunday, I have been with her in the church.
    <br>Things that I couldn't see from her - I could now begin to see from her.
    <br>She has totally changed.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I don't even know what to say.
    <br>I can only say, "Thank You, Jesus".
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So that peace, that love, that affection in the marriage
    <br>has been completely restored after the deliverance?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God, sir. And what is your own word of advice to viewers all over the world?
    <br>My word of advice to viewers all over the world, even the people inside here:
    <br>Whenever you have got a situation like us, run to God
    <br>because if you run to false churches, you can lose your life.
    <br>But because God is there, we were inside that church,
    <br>we did not know that it was a false church - we thought maybe it was a church.
    <br>We found out that it was not a real 
    <br>church through Emmanuel TV, in 2008.
    <br>Then we started following Emmanuel TV up 'til today.
    <br>Amen, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
