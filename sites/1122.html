    <br>God Almighty uses Prophet T.B. Joshua as a channel of light
    <br>to dispel every shade of darkness in the lives of the people
    <br>As he leads the congregation in mass prayer, he reveals the root cause
    <br>of the problems in the lives of the people through words of prophecy.
    <br>There is a woman. You just left your marriage and your husband is begging you to come back
    <br>but you are in-between decision.
    <br>You are in-between decision.
    <br>You left your marriage and your husband is begging you to come back.
    <br>You are in-between decision - whether to go or not. Please come.
    <br>Jesus loves you. Come.
    <br>Sir, I am the one you called who left her husband.
    <br>I left my husband and I am trying to decide. Right now, I have not decided to go back.
    <br>He was the one who told me to come to church.
    <br>You say you are contemplating going back to your husband
    <br>because each time you see yourself in the mirror, you are happy.
    <br>You have to go back. Okay?
    <br>What you have done to your husband is more than what your husband has done to you.
    <br>Okay?
    <br>So, I will talk to you.
    <br>You can't trade anything with that, okay?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You know in your home, they don't have settled homes.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Okay. You don't have settled homes.
    <br>It is true, sir.
    <br>For you to have...
    <br>The beginning of your life was disappointment.
    <br>Yes, sir. It is true, sir.
    <br>You know you started your life with disappointment.
    <br>Your first attempt failed before you met this man.
    <br>Yes, sir. It is true, sir.
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Gloria Albert Egbelo.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband Albert Egbelo.
    <br>Last week Sunday, I sat at the back when the man of God was prophecying.
    <br>He said that there was a lady down there who just left her husband.
    <br>The husband had been begging her to come back.
    <br>She was still contemplating whether to come back or not.
    <br>That was when I now came out.
    <br>Can you tell us your life experiences in your marriage
    <br>that brought about that decision you took to pack out of the house.
    <br>Before I left my husband's house, my husband was busy drinking, womanising.
    <br>He was not even paying attention to the house because of the women that he kept.
    <br>He had other women outside so he wasn't paying attention at all.
    <br>Sometimes, he would go and drink and come back very drunk,
    <br>be vomiting everwhere so I was tired.
    <br>At a point, the parents said that the fault was from me.
    <br>So that was why I left the house. I packed my things, carried my baby and left
    <br>when my husband starting displaying such behaviours.
    <br>I now lost affection - sometimes, I used to tell him, "I hate you!"
    <br>I don't know affection at all.
    <br>He doesn't even sleep with me.
    <br>Anytime he comes close to me, it irritates me.
    <br>Even when he uses a spoon to eat, I wash the spoon before I eat with the spoon.
    <br>Now tell us what happened when you finally came to The SCOAN.
    <br>On one Sunday, I came to the church.
    <br>The man of God was then prophecying that there was a lady in the church
    <br>that just left her husband and she was in-between deciding whether to come back or not.
    <br>That prophecy was very very true.
    <br>Because even when I came to the church, I was even saying,
    <br>"When I go back, I will not go back to him again".
    <br>So before the man of God prophecied and said that there was a lady in the church
    <br>that left her husband and she was still contemplating on whether to go back or not.
    <br>It is true because I was contemplating, I was so tired. I said, "I'm not going back!"
    <br>I said to myself, "Should I go back to this man and continue with this suffering?
    <br>No! I will not go back!"
    <br>Now, after the prophecy, tell us what happened that brought about the testimony today.
    <br>After the prophecy, the man of God prayed for me.
    <br>He then invited my husband and prayed for us.
    <br>After the prayers, everything just disappeared.
    <br>Even my husband has changed. He has turned into a lovely man.
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ! Put your hands together beautifully
    <br>for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Now, people really want to understand the difference.
    <br>You said, before now, it got to a stage where the hatred was so terrible
    <br>to the extent that after your husband finished using a spoon to eat,
    <br>you had to wash the spoon - sterilise it very well before you used it
    <br>to really explain the extent of that hatred, that the affection was no longer there.
    <br>Tell us the changes you are seeing right now
    <br>to confirm that the Lord has delivered you and your husband.
    <br>Since after the deliverance, in fact, if my husband is not by my side for a second,
    <br>I would start calling him, "Where are you? Come back now!"
    <br>My husband doesn't drink; he doesn't do all those things.
    <br>He comes back early. Even when a woman is passing, he wouldn't react.
    <br>Everything has now changed. Even my behaviour towards him has changed.
    <br>I love him so much.
    <br>Okay. Before now, each time he was moving with you, he would be looking somewhere else?
    <br>Before now, I didn't even move with him because any time he said, "Let's go out,
    <br>I would say, "You go! I will come and meet you" because I didn't even want people seeing us around.
    <br>But right now, after the deliverance?
    <br>Now, he is my...
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>To God be the glory! Only Jesus can do this.
    <br>We thank God Almighty. You can imagine a wonderful marriage that is at the verge of divorce.
    <br>At the end of the day, the Lord delivered them
    <br>and right now, they are reconciled back to the glory of God.
    <br>Let's put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Now, before we listen to words of advice from you, let's quickly hear from your husband.
    <br>My name is Albert Egbelo.
    <br>I'm a deputy superintendent of police. I am a unit commander.
    <br>The woman next to me is my dear wife.
    <br>What she said rightly - all was right.
    <br>I was busy drinking and womanising before.
    <br>Lsst week Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied about her and she was picked out.
    <br>After the deliverance and prayers from Prophet T.B. Joshua for my wife and myself,
    <br>all the things I used to do - the drinking, following women,
    <br>coming back home late - stopped because he prayed for me.
    <br>I bless God and thank God for my life and my family.
    <br>Okay. Let us now know about the difference between you and your wife.
    <br>She said that before now, she didn't want to see you at all.
    <br>What are the changes you have seen as a man?
    <br>She is wonderful now.
    <br>My attention, my mind, everything, the drinking, everything she did not want
    <br>has stopped after the deliverance.
    <br>Right now, I see her as my angel and everything to me.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>And the area of womanising - what can you say about it?
    <br>Well, for those who do not know, there is nothing to gain there because I've been there.
    <br>The area of womanising - God has touched me
    <br>and there is not any other woman that is far better than my wife.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Amen. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>We thank God Almight for what He has done in your life and also in the life of your wife.
    <br>As a man - many men are listening to you; they want to hear a word of advice from you.
    <br>What's your advice to men and to everyone?
    <br>My advice - I'm a man.
    <br>My advice to all men over the world, particularly the ones seated here is:
    <br>They should pay attention to their wifes at home,
    <br>pay attention to God, be particularly always prayerful. Thank you.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Finally, let us also hear a piece of advice from your wife.
    <br>Can you advise women and everyone.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My advice to all women is: When you have a problem or challenges,
    <br>although your challenge is telling you to run to God and not go out,
    <br>because of those challenges I had to run away
    <br>but the challenges were then telling me, "Please, when you are having challenges,
    <br>any time you are having challenges with your husband, know that it is not him
    <br>but the spirit is disturbing him. Please, run to God, pray for him.
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>God is with us!
    <br>Put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
    <br>Yes, that is indeed a wonderful advice.
    <br>She said it loud and clear that if she did not run to God,
    <br>today, the story would have changed.
    <br>We thank God Almighty that the Lord Almighty who she ran to has restored her marriage happily.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for her life.
    <br>We really rejoice with you greatly.
    <br>We also want to advise you to make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>As you go and make the Word of God the standard for your life,
    <br>always have it at the back of your mind that better is not good enough,
    <br>the best is always yet to come.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God!
