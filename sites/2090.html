    <br>THE MEANING OF GRACE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God's time is the best."
    <br>At His own time miracles happen.
    <br>Yes, at His own time healing, deliverance happen - not our own time.
    <br>Everything is beautiful in His own time.
    <br>You are welcome to the arena liberty.
    <br>THE MEANING OF GRACE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>In the arena of liberty, the key is not to suppress the flesh.
    <br>The key is to surrender to the Spirit.
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Paul apostle says there is a much better way.
    <br>The solution is not to worry about the flesh.
    <br>The way out is not to worry about your situation.
    <br>"Ah, is my problem solved today? I am having this!" No!
    <br>The solution is not to worry about your situation but to walk in the Spirit.
    <br>Walking in the Spirit is so exciting.
    <br>Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on us.
    <br>Enter our soul
    <br>and make our heart a dwelling place.
    <br>Strengthen our desire.
    <br>Strengthen our determination.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God is concerned about me.
    <br>He has many miracles in store for me.
    <br>You can give Him a chance to prove it."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Give Him a chance to prove it.
    <br>He has many miracles in store for me."
    <br>Are you ready to give Him a chance to prove it?
    <br>Listen to your mind.
    <br>The testimony of your conscience will set you free.
    <br>Our reading shall be taken from the 1 Chronicles 29:1.
    <br>"Furthermore King David said to all the assembly: 'My son Solomon,
    <br>whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced;
    <br>and the work is great, because the temple is not for man but for the LORD God'."
    <br>The work in the temple is so great because the temple is not for man but God.
    <br>1 Chronicles 29:2:
    <br>Now for the house of my God I have prepared with all my might: gold..."
    <br>Let's go to verse 12.
    <br>"Both riches and honour come from You, and You reign over all.
    <br>In Your hand is power and might;
    <br>in Your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all."
    <br>Verse 13:
    <br>"Now therefore, our God, we thank You and praise Your glorious name."
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>This will lead us to the message:
    <br>GRACE IN THE SOUL PART 3
    <br>We are in the arena of liberty,
    <br>arena of freedom, solution.
    <br>The Bible is saying here: The work is great because the temple is not for man but God.
    <br>The work of healing, the work of deliverance, the work of prophecy,
    <br>the work of salvation, the work of preaching, teaching, just name them.
    <br>These are not brought to pass by anything done by us.
    <br>Therefore, all boasting...
    <br>"... In the name of Jesus! Yes! In Jesus' name, you are healed!
    <br>I say you are healed, you must be healed." - No.
    <br>All boasting is excluded.
    <br>He who glories must not glory in his name but in the name of the Lord.
    <br>There is no room for any man's boasting of his own abilities and power.
    <br>"It happened from me. I live right - that is why the miracle happened.
    <br>I fasted forty days, forty nights - that is why it happened.
    <br>I am slim, I am fat, tall, light in complexion, my face is round" - no!
    <br>It appears that all is of grace
    <br>because all our spiritual advantages are from God.
    <br>The Bible says our spiritual life results from our union with Christ.
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself: But me, who am I?
    <br>Who are these my people,
    <br>that we should presume to be giving something to God?
    <br>Everything comes from Him and everything you will receive in your future will come from Him.
    <br>What have you to give God?
    <br>My head
    <br>My shoulders
    <br>My knees
    <br>My toes
    <br>My head
    <br>My shoulders
    <br>My knees
    <br>My toes
    <br>My head
    <br>My shoulders
    <br>My knees
    <br>My toes
    <br>They all belong to Jesus
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>It all came from God.
    <br>It was all Yours in the first place.
    <br>God has ordered all so that the whole shall appear to be of grace.
    <br>Our faith, our conversion, our eternal salvation
    <br>are not the mere products of any natural ability.
    <br>No man should boast.
    <br>This is why a weak person like me, without smoothness of tongue, without fast legs,
    <br>should ever remain grateful for the purpose He has created me.
    <br>You can never tell when your time is coming.
    <br>This philosophy seems to work against common sense.
    <br>When you look at the whole thing, from 'common sense',
    <br>you will ask,
    <br>"Do you mean I should not work?", or "Do you mean I should not run 'helter-skelter'?"
    <br>"Do you mean I should not work hard?"
    <br>Work hard but God will still have to mark your work.
    <br>THE MEANING OF GRACE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Work hard. Work as if everything depends on you;
    <br>pray as if everything depends on God!"
    <br>THE MEANING OF GRACE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>"I run a race; yes, I am the best..."
    <br>As a Christian - God will still have to mark your work.
    <br>After our hard work, leave the issue with God.
    <br>THE MEANING OF GRACE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Those who see beyond their immediate situation, they do not despair
    <br>in the face of seeming disappointment, seeming delay.
    <br>It looks like delay but there is no real evil in it.
    <br>Your delay may be to stop you awhile in order to preserve you.
    <br>Your delay may be to stop you awhile in order to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>Your delay may be to stop you awhile in order to keep you for a new level.
    <br>That sickness, disease, disappointment, failure may be
    <br>to stop you awhile in order to prepare you for a new level in life.
    <br>In 1 Samuel, when you take your reading from verse 1 to the end about Hannah:
    <br>If Hannah had been impatient over her inability to bear a child,
    <br>as expected, she would have sought other shortcuts to achieve her desire
    <br>and the history would have been changed.
    <br>Those who see beyond their immediate situation do not despair, do not murmur.
    <br>Even when you see them suffering - "Yes. God bless you. Thank you."
    <br>Because they know that that situation is meant to preserve them, to stop them awhile
    <br>in order to prepare them for the challenges,
    <br>is meant to keep them for a new level in life,
    <br>is meant to strengthen their desire for God.
    <br>Have you received a sack letter as a Christian?
    <br>Remember, many successful men today had once received the same kind of letter
    <br>but they were moved to a higher level.
    <br>THE MEANING OF GRACE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Is it lateness in marriage,
    <br>or a delay in bearing a child?
    <br>Is it poverty, in spite of your hard work and qualification?
    <br>Is it inability to get a job, in spite of your effort?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>The race is not always for the swift.
    <br>The battle is not always for the brave.
    <br>One would think that men of great understanding
    <br>who are masters in the art of management
    <br>will always be men of substance.
    <br>But many a good man spend their time uncelebrated, unnoticed and in obscurity.
    <br>God has purposely left us in the dark concerning future events.
    <br>THE MEANING OF GRACE!!! | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God wants us to always be ready."
    <br>When we do not know what will happen next, that will make us to watch and pray.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When I do not know what will happen next,
    <br>that will make me to watch and pray."
    <br>You don't know what will happen next - that is why you are here today.
    <br>The uncertainty of the hour of Christ's return calls for vigilance and watchfulness.
    <br>He will come like a thief; no one knows when and how.
    <br>Riches and glory come from You.
    <br>You are Ruler over all.
    <br>You hold strength and power in the palm of Your hand to build up and strengthen all.
    <br>Here we are giving You thanks, praising Your holy name.
    <br>Amen.
