  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>What a great and wonderful God we serve!
    <br>Our God is an awesome God.
    <br>We are serving a Living God;
    <br>to His power, nothing is impossible.
    <br>He is here in our midst today.
    <br>Greet Him. Say, "Thank You, Jesus!"
    <br>He is indeed the Living God.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>You may be seated. Have your seat in His presence.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>My name is Racine.
    <br>I'm here today to share His message of salvation, in Jesus' name.
    <br>I say to you, "In Jesus' name".
    <br>God's Word is the key.
    <br>Let someone say, "God's Word is the key".
    <br>God has given us the way to abundant life.
    <br>The way to success, the way to good success is for you today.
    <br>So no matter what you face today,
    <br>I pray God gives you the grace to listen to this message.
    <br>This message I have received from the teaching of the man of God.
    <br>By the time you listen to this message and apply it,
    <br>you will know that the way out for you has come.
    <br>Say, "The way out for me has come".
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Brethren, there are many questionable conversions today.
    <br>Many are merely convinced but not yet converted.
    <br>You can know if one's conversion is questionable;
    <br>you can know when the man cannot act on the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Mental assent recognises the truthfulness of the Word of God but cannot act on the Word.
    <br>There is a difference between knowing about God and knowing God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>One can be convinced that Jesus is the Son of God and still never find Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, listen to the Word of God".
    <br>In His Word - salvation.
    <br>In His Word - deliverance.
    <br>Knowing the Holy Spirit is knowing God.
    <br>It is the Spirit of the Father who reveals God to us.
    <br>That is why we say, we are sons and daughters of God by revelation.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, we are sons and daughters of God by revelation".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If one is serving God without the Holy Spirit, he is serving a god he does not know.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, don't tell me what you feel.
    <br>Tell me what you know.
    <br>Tell me what you believe.
    <br>We are Christians by revelation".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "I am a Christian by revelation".
    <br>We act in the Word,
    <br>we do the Word,
    <br>we live in the Word
    <br>and we trust implicitly in the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Acting on the Word of God makes Jesus truly real to the believer.
    <br>Acting on the Word of God gives God the opportunity to bless you,
    <br>to heal you, to deliver you and to save you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, we are Christians by revelation".
    <br>The Bible says, the Christian home - put your hand on your heart -
    <br>say, "The Christian home - that home is your heart.
    <br>The Christian home is the high school of learning whereby many truths are imbibed".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Holy Spirit is the Organ by which we apprehend spiritual things, spiritual truths.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This brings us to our message today: The Illumination of the Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The Illumination of the Spirit".
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, be illumined by the Spirit of God".
    <br>Turn your Bible with me to the Book of 2 Corinthians.
    <br>We start our reading from Chapter 4.
    <br>2 Corinthians 4.
    <br>I start from verse 6 to 7.
    <br>It reads:
    <br>"For it is the God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts
    <br>to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
    <br>Verse 7.
    <br>"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels,
    <br>that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the illumination of the Holy Spirit".
    <br>In the Book of Acts 19 - when you go home, you read from verse 1 to 6 -
    <br>Paul the Apostle visited the church at Ephesus
    <br>and he perceived that they were serving a god they did not know.
    <br>He asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?"
    <br>Because knowing Jesus is knowing the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>They answered, "We have never heard that there is a Holy Spirit".
    <br>Their worship was defective.
    <br>They knew all the rites but still they did not know Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When Paul began to preach the revealing Word of God, spiritual enlightenment came.
    <br>They acted on it and the saving power of God descended on them and they were saved
    <br>and they received the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What can we say about that today?
    <br>Brethren, the Kingdom of Light, the Kingdom of God is not something hoped for or a mere wish;
    <br>it is a fact - it is a reality.
    <br>Jesus said in Luke 17:20-22 that the Kingdom of God does not come by observation or sight
    <br>but the Kingdom of God is within you.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Light is within you".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This means, the Kingdom of Light is in the Living Word within you.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the Kingdom of Light is in the Living Word within you".
    <br>You need to discover it.
    <br>We need to discover it.
    <br>The Scripture says, the great objects of faith are made known to us by divine revelation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How does that revelation come?
    <br>How does it come?
    <br>Ask the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua and he will tell you:
    <br>It is not all up to God and certainly, it is not all up to you; you have a role to play.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, you have a role to play".
    <br>What is that role?
    <br>Me-di-ta-tion!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Are you ready for the journey?
    <br>Are you ready for the key to success?
    <br>Say, "Meditation brings revelation".
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Meditation in the Word of God is a visit with God.
    <br>It is when you meditate on the Word of God that the Word of God enters your heart - your spirit -
    <br>and when it does, our spirit acts on it and revelation comes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Meditation brings revelation".
    <br>The new revelation knowledge that comes from above comes by acting in the Word
    <br>and living in the Word.
    <br>Job 32:8 says that when the Holy Spirit begins to speak to our hearts,
    <br>revelation comes and changes are beginning.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The man of God says that revelation is the realisation of something not previously known.
    <br>Say, "Revelation is the realisation of something not previously known".
    <br>When you know it, you will know God's opinion about you and others.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Revelation brings conviction.
    <br>Say, "Revelation brings conviction".
    <br>The Book of Romans 14:5 says, "Let everyone be convinced in his own mind".
    <br>You have heard so much about this ministry.
    <br>Many are here to see but the Bible says, "Let everyone be convinced in his own mind".
    <br>That I have the revelation that Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the Son of God,
    <br>the Saviour of the world, does not mean I can get you to believe the truth.
    <br>You must get that revelation yourself in order to believe because faith is a conviction.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Faith is a conviction".
    <br>It is a trust that arises in each person's heart, based on the Word of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is conviction?
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, says that
    <br>conviction is the awakening of man's conscience to the truth.
    <br>Say to yourself, "Conviction is the awakening of my conscience to the truth".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What is truth?
    <br>The Scripture says to know the truth is to know Jesus Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith in Christ Jesus is a trust that arises out of the fact that
    <br>God is reliable, trustworthy and steadfast.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>To trust means to believe the truth, to accept the truth
    <br>and be totally committed to that truth.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you do, nothing can change your mind about what you believe.
    <br>You will remain an agent of truth in the midst of lies.
    <br>You will remain an agent of faithfulness in the midst of unfaithfulness.
    <br>You will remain a channel of humility in the face of pride.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Let someone say, "Revelation brings conviction".
    <br>This means, every time our spirit acts on the revealing Word of God,
    <br>something enters our spirit that increases our assurance - that is conviction.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, I am a child of God.
    <br>I am born again. I am justified. I am redeemed.
    <br>I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.
    <br>It is the development of God's Word on the inside of you by meditation
    <br>that gives birth to belief in your heart.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, it is the development of God's Word on the inside of me
    <br>that gives birth to belief in my heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Faith is my movement towards God".
    <br>Mediation in the Word is a visit with God.
    <br>The more you get closer to God by meditation,
    <br>the more you begin to sense His righteousness and holiness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Revelation brings conviction.
    <br>Conviction brings real movement.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Conviction leads to a heart decision, which leads to real movement.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What do I mean by that?
    <br>The Bible says, when we move, power steps.
    <br>Say, "When I step, power steps - the power of God - with intent and purpose".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>How can this happen?
    <br>Let someone say, "God Almighty is with us in the Living Word".
    <br>Say, "Emmanuel!
    <br>God with me!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>God with me!"
    <br>The Living God is with us in the Living Word.
    <br>This means, every step we take, we step in the presence of God.
    <br>Every look I take, I look with the power of God.
    <br>Every movement I take, I move with the Kingdom of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, when I move, power moves".
    <br>To stay with Jesus Christ of Nazareth is to stay with the Holy Spirit -
    <br>there lies our safety.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Revelation brings conviction.
    <br>Conviction brings real movement.
    <br>Now to illustrate this process, let's go to the Bible.
    <br>In the Book of Acts 10:9-19, the Bible says there was a man called Cornelius.
    <br>He had a divine appointment with God -
    <br>a divine appointment with salvation, with righteousness of God
    <br>but God does nothing without His Word.
    <br>So, God chose Simon Peter to be the one to deliver the message of righteousness
    <br>to the household of Cornelius.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Peter, being a Jew, had no interaction with gentiles.
    <br>He never went to the house of a gentile, so God gave him a vision of revelation.
    <br>Read from verse 10 to 11.
    <br>God showed him all sorts of impure animals and said, "Peter, kill and eat".
    <br>Peter said, "Lord, I have never eaten anything impure".
    <br>God said, "Don't call impure what I call pure".
    <br>He resisted the vision three times because Peter could not understand the vision.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, say, "Meditation brings revelation".
    <br>Verse 19 says when Peter was busy thinking over the vision, meditating on the vision,
    <br>the Bible says revelation came.
    <br>The Spirit of God spoke to him and said to him,
    <br>'Go with them; doubt nothing. I am the One that sent them'.
    <br>That meditation brought revelation;
    <br>that revelation brought to Peter conviction that this is the will of God.
    <br>Then, he took a real movement.
    <br>Peter stepped out with boldness and went to the house of Cornelius -
    <br>obedience to the Word of God.
    <br>The Bible says when he came, he preached the Word of salvation
    <br>and the power of God came on all the household.
    <br>And the Bible says they were saved.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What lesson can we learn from Peter's experience for us today?
    <br>No one can obey the written Word without the help of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Human nature, the natural man, the man of the mind and intellect
    <br>cannot understand or receive the things of the Holy Ghost
    <br>because they are spiritually discerned.
    <br>So, our earthly understanding must give way to spiritual enlightenment.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Neighbour, I don't know what your problem is this morning.
    <br>I don't know what brought you today.
    <br>But all I know, God is still saying something.
    <br>No matter how dark your situation is, God is saying something!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Finally, brethren.
    <br>If our faith is to be a 'New Testament faith',
    <br>if Christ Jesus is to be the Christ of God rather than the Christ of history - baby Jesus,
    <br>then the illumination of the Spirit will tell in your heart
    <br>that you are learning at the feet of Jesus, not at the feet of man.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Christianity stands or falls on Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
    <br>Christianity stands or falls on the illumination of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>No one can say, "Jesus is Lord!" unless he is guided by the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the way out for you has come.
    <br>Neighbour, the way to a successful prayer life has come.
    <br>The key to revelation has come.
    <br>The key to conviction has come.
    <br>The key to the step of faith has come".
    <br>No matter what you are experiencing here today, don't panic; run to God.
    <br>Run to God!
    <br>No matter how dark the situation you are experiencing today in your life,
    <br>home, business, career, engage your heart with God.
    <br>The Bible says if the answers to your prayers are not given, hold on and hold out
    <br>'til you receive revelation, understanding from God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, meditate 'til God Almighty gives you a clear light".
    <br>When the illumination of the Spirit comes into your life and situation,
    <br>you will know the power you are under.
    <br>You will know God's opinion about yourself and others.
    <br>You will know God's opinion on the matter, why God allowed the things to happen -
    <br>to bring a greater revelation in your life.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation; revelation brings results.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Now, brethren, this is my word.
    <br>Can you stand up in His presence.
    <br>Can you stand up in the presence of God.
    <br>Say, "I am a Christian by revelation.
    <br>I know I am serving the Living God.
    <br>You situation, trouble - you want to blacken, darken but let me tell you,
    <br>beyond that situation lies God's purpose for my life.
    <br>I know the way out for me has come.
    <br>Today, I am in the presence of the Almighty God.
    <br>You situation, I refuse to obey.
    <br>I know my God is greater than you".
    <br>Today, when you apply the message, mediation brings revelation.
    <br>Say, "God dwells in my heart.
    <br>Meditation brings conviction; conviction brings real movement.
    <br>I take a step of faith.
    <br>I will not draw back; I will move on and on because victory is mine!"
    <br>God bless His Word!
