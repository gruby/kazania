    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Attention: The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>and although it is not suitable for all viewers,
    <br>it is for the glory of God.
    <br>Look, as this man is brought to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations,
    <br>being fully carried by two men, due to the severity of his affliction,
    <br>the terrible leg ulcer is plain to see.
    <br>Unable to apply any pressure on the wounded leg, the man limps
    <br>and is totally dependant on the support of the two men.
    <br>They help him to his seat, with a great effort.
    <br>Mr. Onyeka Nnaji has come to The SCOAN with the problem of a horrific leg ulcer.
    <br>Affecting the entire leg, the ulcer has eaten away at the flesh of the calf muscle.
    <br>Gruesomely, the remaining skin hangs open, revealing the damage done to the inside of the leg.
    <br>The jagged face of the wound continually oozes pus, which drips down his leg with blood.
    <br>As one can barely behold the appalling sight,
    <br>so one can hardly imagine the offensive odor caused by the ulcer
    <br>which this man has had to live with in such pain.
    <br>Down the leg, you can see his ankle and foot are blistered and swollen,
    <br>a tell tale sign that the ulcer is getting worse.
    <br>A full on view from the back of his leg confronts one with the severity of this condition.
    <br>He is in dire need of the Healer, the Restorer and Repairer, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Welcome to the arena of liberty, The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations prayer line.
    <br>Father, we thank You for Your healing.
    <br>We thank You for the power of ressurection, in Jesus' name. Thank You, Lord.
    <br>He awaits his encounter with Prophet T.B. Joshua at the prayer line
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has begun to pray for the leg ulcer of Mr. Onyeka Nnaji, in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ, you are free.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Glory be to God, Mr. Nnaji has been declared free and walks in the light of his testimony.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Sometime after the prayer, Mr. Onyeka Nnaji came back to The SCOAN
    <br>to show how far his healing had progressed.
    <br>As he turned his leg around, we can see the color of his skin has become normal
    <br>and the skin around his ankles and toes has been healed.
    <br>Most importantly, the once raptured and grievous wound is showing good signs of recovery
    <br>and the presence of hair on his leg once again indicates that his good health has indeed been restored.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Still later, Mr. Onyeka Nnaji returned to The SCOAN,
    <br>this time to testify to the goodness and power of God in his life.
    <br>As his leg, which was once smitten by a terrible ulcer,  is now completely healed.
    <br>Turning his leg, you can still see the scar tissue, the last evidence of the once horrific and incurable condition
    <br>that brought Mr. Nnaji to The SCOAN,
    <br>an affliction which was cured by a word in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Do you still feel any pain?
    <br>I'm not feeling any pain anymore.
    <br>Can you tap it and rub it very well,  and let us see.
    <br>How do you feel now?
    <br>I don't feel any pain anymore.
    <br>I'm free, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Complimentary to his healing, Mr. Nnaji has gained weight and looks extremely well.
    <br>Mr. Nnaji boldly taps his leg without any fear of pain.
    <br>When asked if he still felt any pain, he replied with a resounding "No".
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Nnaji Onyeka, I am from Enugu state.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that of leg ulcer.
    <br>I sought help for three years, moving from one hospital to another without any solution.
    <br>I wasted all my money.
    <br>I lost my job, then my father took me to The SCOAN.
    <br>After the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, prayed for me, I became free.
    <br>I am free as you can see now.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>I thank God for my life.
    <br>What are the things you could not do then because of this problem?
    <br>I could not even eat or talk.
    <br>I used to use a pen to communicate by writing, before they could know what I wanted to do.
    <br>Since the Lord God has done this wonderful miracle in your life, how have you been feeling?
    <br>I am free now.
    <br>Can you show us once again the very spot where you had the problem?
    <br>Tap it and tell us how you are feeling now.
    <br>I don't feel any pain anymore.
    <br>The Lord God Almighty has set him free. Shall we put our hands together for the miracle-working Jesus!
    <br>I advise each and everyone one of us to be serious in prayer, and worship and praise God.
    <br>Let my experience be an example for you.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what He has done
    <br>and we also want to encourage you that now the Lord has set you free,
    <br>you should make His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>and we pray that God will grant you the grace to do so, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen.
