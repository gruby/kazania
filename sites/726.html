    <br>Thank you. You may be seated.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good morning.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes! As it should be by Divine will.
    <br>Let me wish you Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
    <br>So, you know we are dwelling on "your faith will not fail".
    <br>I think that is what we are actually dwelling on.
    <br>Some of our actions - we sometimes thought it's faith, but it is not Biblical faith.
    <br>I think it is very important to look into that faith that is not Biblical.
    <br>There is other faith: We have faith in faith, faith in yourself and faith in others
    <br>like I have mentioned the last time.
    <br>Looking at those things that are not Biblical faith - but we see them as faith.
    <br>They are not Biblical.
    <br>When you know those things that are not Biblical faith,
    <br>you have a better understanding of what Biblical faith is.
    <br>I will take you to the book of Acts 14.
    <br>Let's quickly look at just a snapping healing that took place when Paul was addressing a congregation.
    <br>(Acts 14:8) "In Lystra, there sat a man who was lame."
    <br>That is, a man was there who was lame - could not walk.
    <br>(Acts 14:8) "He had been that way from birth"
    <br>He was born with it, with lameness.
    <br>(Acts 14:8) "and had never walked."
    <br>That is, the man had never, never walked.
    <br>He was born lame right from birth.
    <br>(Acts 14:9) "He listened to Paul"
    <br>This man was listening to Paul.
    <br>(Acts 14:9) "as he was speaking."
    <br>A lame man right from birth.
    <br>(Acts 14:9) "He listened to Paul as he was speaking.
    <br>(Acts 14:9) "Paul looked directly at him,"
    <br>At a lame man - listen to that.
    <br>(Acts 14:9) "saw that he had faith to be healed."
    <br>Hmm, listen to that.
    <br>A lame man who was born lame.
    <br>He was in the meeting when Paul was addressing the congregants.
    <br>(Acts 14:9) "Paul looked directly at him, and saw that he had faith to be healed."
    <br>Do you have faith to receive? That is the question.
    <br>What faith are they talking about here?
    <br>Do you have faith to be set free?
    <br>It means all of this demands for your faith.
    <br>It is not all up to Jesus; certainly it is not all up to you.
    <br>Your genuine willingness plus Jesus' ability.
    <br>It demands for your faith.
    <br>Paul saw in him faith to be healed.
    <br>Do you have the faith?
    <br>Here, I stand as Paul.
    <br>Can I see faith to be healed, to be blessed, to be delivered in you?
    <br>Can I? In you?
    <br>It calls for a question.
    <br>(Acts 14:9) "Paul looked directly at him, and saw that he had faith to be healed."
    <br>If I look at you, can I see faith?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Will I see faith?
    <br>What you are calling faith today is mere feeling.
    <br>You are disturbed.
    <br>Your heart is not at its best.
    <br>That is why we allow you to dance - to wipe away those troubles.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You ask, "Why dancing in the church?
    <br>Why so much time for dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing?"
    <br>So that you can forget where you are coming from.
    <br>Because where you are coming from is full of debts, trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Your heart can only be at its best when you are happy - peace of heart.
    <br>And God can only attract you,
    <br>the Spirit of God can only attract you - attract your heart - join himself to you -
    <br>to bless you - when your heart is at its best.
    <br>So much trouble.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We find ourselves in a generation without peace and patience.
    <br>There is no patience - hurry! hurry!
    <br>You time yourself. Imagine, you are coming to God, and you time yourself.
    <br>You have given a lot of appointments that "I'll be leaving here in 3 to 5 hours".
    <br>God is not one of those things.
    <br>You can time yourself to do business.
    <br>You can time yourself to visit a friend. You can time yourself to visit anyone.
    <br>You can time yourself to do anything.
    <br>But when it comes to God, disown it.
    <br>You don't time yourself to meet God.
    <br>This is where you miss the mark.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In our various places of worship, we have time at which we should leave,
    <br>time to worship, time to sing in, to sing out,
    <br>time to do this, time to do that.
    <br>We don't time God because it's all about inspiration from Heaven.
    <br>We don't instruct God, we don't tell God when to start, how to start,
    <br>when to stop, when to start, when to begin.
    <br>This is where you miss the mark.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"I'm here for a purpose",
    <br>"I am here to be healed", "I am here to be blessed".
    <br>This is bargaining.
    <br>You are bargaining with God.
    <br>Do you pay God?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"I'm here to be delivered today."
    <br>This is bargaining.
    <br>Simply a bribe.
    <br>Whatever you now give, seems to be a bribe.
    <br>That is corruption.
    <br>You take that corruption to the house of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever you now give is, because you are here for a purpose.
    <br>Whatever you now give, is a way of saying, "I give this, You give me this".
    <br>We are all sitting as if we really mean business.
    <br>But it's because we don't have so much to do today.
    <br>Today is a free day, that is why you give it to God.
    <br>You only give to God what you do not need, time you do not need.
    <br>Your quality time - you can't give it to God.
    <br>You don't have any appointments today, that is why you are here.
    <br>You don't give your quality time to God.
    <br>If God continued to give you what He Himself did not need,
    <br>as you are giving change...
    <br>You know when you want to give your offering?
    <br>These are things you collected from the petrol station - change.
    <br>The money you collected from the conductor (public transport operators).
    <br>The money you collected from where you buy and sell.
    <br>That is the change you give to God.
    <br>If God continued to give you such change back in return -
    <br>what God did not need - what you do not need -
    <br>would you say He has blessed you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You believe you are serving God.
    <br>Are you serving Him with your quality time, your quality strength?
    <br>Let's look at what is not Biblical faith.
    <br>We say faith, we have faith; but you need Biblical faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You deny everything. When they ask you, "What is your problem?",
    <br>you prefer to say a different thing.
    <br>You don't tell people - until you are about to die.
    <br>Getting to the point of death, you can say it out.
    <br>Or when the doctors reject you and say, "No, this is above us".
    <br>Then, you run to God.
    <br>You deny the existence of a problem.
    <br>Faith is not denial.
    <br>Faith does not deny the existence of a problem.
    <br>There is a problem.
    <br>Even the Bible says, "In this world there will be tribulations. Cheer up; I have overcome".
    <br>There is a problem! Why should you deny it?
    <br>You can't deny it!
    <br>Everyone has limitations.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is not denial.
    <br>Faith does not deny the existence of a problem.
    <br>There is a problem!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Everybody has a medical report somewhere.
    <br>Your medical record.
    <br>But when you are getting to the point of death, you run to God.
    <br>You are ready to say, "This is what I have",
    <br>"This is my problem".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say you are a Christian.
    <br>A person has to recognise he is sick before getting healed.
    <br>He is sick!
    <br>And run to the Healer, the Saviour, before getting healed!
    <br>But at what point do you recognise you are sick?
    <br>When all hope is lost.
    <br>When you have spent all your fortune.
    <br>At what point, do you recognise you are sick and run to Jesus?
    <br>When all hope is lost and everything is gone.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Confessing or not does not change the fact.
    <br>Knowing facts about God does not change your relationship with Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you put the Word of God to work, eventually your circumstances are subject to change.
    <br>Put to work the Word of God.
    <br>Put to work.
    <br>Like last week when I was moving around - if not for the gift of prophecy -
    <br>meeting some people, they would come here and say, "I have fever".
    <br>By the time I am praying, I realise that this is HIV 1 and 2.
    <br>Until they get to the point of death, before they say, "Jesus is Lord!",
    <br>"He is my Healer".
    <br>Faith is not imitation, which is common among us.
    <br>Faith is NOT imitation!
    <br>It cannot be imitated!
    <br>It must arise in each person's heart, based on the Word of God.
    <br>It cannot be imitated.
    <br>But today, what is happening?
    <br>You see everybody doing the same.
    <br>Sometimes, God deals with people in different ways.
    <br>God will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.
    <br>This is why it is a bit dangerous when you pick a textbook
    <br>and you read how to pray.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The Holy Spirit helps us in our prayer.
    <br>When you take a textbook and begin to read how to pray -
    <br>"pray for deliverance", "pray for this", "pray for that" - no.
    <br>God will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God will not meet you
    <br>because you imitate what someone else did".
    <br>That is, someone else prays, "In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>After watching the way the person prays, you also get there and say,
    <br>"In Jesus' name, in Jesus' name!"
    <br>Remember, this one is being inspired to do so.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are not inspired to do so, you are only copying, you are only imitating.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Some of you will pick up a textbook and begin to read
    <br>"7 points of ways to pray".
    <br>You want to fast for 3 days because you read somewhere to do so.
    <br>The person has been inspired to do so.
    <br>Not you!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God will not meet you because you imitate what someone else did.
    <br>God will meet you when you obey what He told you to do by the Spirit,
    <br>based on His Word.
    <br>When you take action in obedience to God, you will prosper.
    <br>When you take action in obedience to God, you will get it.
    <br>You will prosper.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God will not meet you, because you imitate what someone else did".
    <br>Like prayer, like fasting.
    <br>You say, "Somebody asked me to fast",
    <br>"This is the standard", "This is the traditional way", "This is the song to sing ",
    <br>"This is how to sing it out, this is how to sing it in",
    <br>"This is this, this is that",
    <br>"This is what they asked us to do",
    <br>"This is this" - this is a lot.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God will meet you when you obey what He Himself told you to do
    <br>and He can only say it by His Spirit, based on His Word.
    <br>That is, taking action in obedience to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Three, faith is not an issue of ordering God around.
    <br>You know today, our prayer is to instruct God.
    <br>We always instruct God, "I need this. In the name of Jesus give me, give me, give me, give me!"
    <br>You don't mind whether it is His will to give you.
    <br>You don't even bother to know God's will before you ask.
    <br>And if you ask according to His will, He gives.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is not an issue of ordering God around.
    <br>When we pray, we instruct God what to do, what to give us
    <br>and when that is not given, we feel bad! It affects our faith.
    <br>Who knows what would have happened to you,
    <br>if your prayer for a better life had been answered?
    <br>A better life to buy the best car.
    <br>A better life to build a beautiful house.
    <br>A better life to become a governor, a minister, a senator.
    <br>Who knows what would have happened?
    <br>We are talking about those things that are not Biblical faith.
    <br>And we practice it; we say it is faith.
    <br>Many things you do, like many testimonies today,
    <br>people came out to say, "Yes, I ministered my Morning Water 4 times, saying 'Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!'".
    <br>You quickly write it down.
    <br>Why are you writing it down?
    <br>When you get your own, you now say "Oh, that man ministered it 3 times, saying 'Jesus, Jesus'".
    <br>You will now do your own too: "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!!!"
    <br>Nothing happens.
    <br>The man that is talking may be inspired by the Holy Spirit to do so.
    <br>But you are not inspired.
    <br>You are only imitating this man.
    <br>You are an "imitator".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Like many of us have books we read - "prayer",
    <br>"prayer for deliverance: turn this way, 'Jesus! Jesus!' Turn to the other side, 'Jesus, Jesus!'
    <br>Another side, 'Jesus! Jesus!'"
    <br>It get's frustrating when you do that and the prayer is not answered.
    <br>But you are imitating.
    <br>The man, somebody, wrote it.
    <br>The person has been inspired to do so - but not you!
    <br>You will not meet Jesus because you imitate what someone else did.
    <br>What someone else did is what you are reading.
    <br>Unless you receive from God in yourself...
    <br>You will meet God when you obey what God told you directly.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
