  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Let's take our Bibles to the Book of Ephesians 1.
    <br>We will take it from verse 1.
    <br>I know that every aspect of that message is written because of me.
    <br>"Paul, an apostle of our Lord, Jesus Christ by the will of God."
    <br>This means, the Lord manifested His strength in his weakness.
    <br>When he is weak, then he is strong - that is just the words "by the will of God".
    <br>When you say that it's by the grace of God, it shows that it's not by your power;
    <br>whatever you might have achieved - it's God, not you.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God."
    <br>That is grace.
    <br>Let someone say, "Grace".
    <br>Grace - it's opposite of merit.
    <br>Not the work of righteousness which you have done, but according to His grace.
    <br>After you have done so much, Jesus still needs to mark it.
    <br>You say, "I have finished the job - it's fine".
    <br>No, don't say it's fine yet, until the Lord marks it.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>After you have done it perfectly to you, humanly, you say, "It is OK. What else again?"
    <br>No, it is not OK yet.
    <br>Wait for God, don't judge.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>"To the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus:
    <br>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
    <br>Grace - power.
    <br>Power - grace.
    <br>Grace - power.
    <br>Look at that statement.
    <br>This shows that whatever you hear from me here - grace,
    <br>whatever I'm doing here today - grace.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Do I look like someone who can run?
    <br>No. Jesus!
    <br>Do I look like somebody who can talk?
    <br>No. Look at me very well.
    <br>Let someone say, "Grace".
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Verse 3:
    <br>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the Heavenly places in Christ."
    <br>What else again? The blessing is there.
    <br>"I have finished the job" - no, it's past tense.
    <br>Healing, you are talking about - it's past tense.
    <br>Let's quickly look at the Book of Proverbs 4:10.
    <br>"Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of your life will be many.
    <br>I have taught you in the way of wisdom."
    <br>In the way of knowledge I have taught you - it is past.
    <br>Even before you were born.
    <br>The children yet unborn have been taught already.
    <br>"I have led you in right paths. When you walk, your steps will not be hindered..."
    <br>This is the promise for you.
    <br>Let's look at the title of our message in this way:
    <br>Reasons To Praise God
    <br>Count many blessings
    <br>and your every doubt about God's presence in your life will fly.
    <br>"What has happened to me? What's wrong?" -
    <br>every doubt about God's presence in your life will fly.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I learnt what God has made me for.
    <br>When you learn what God has made you for, you are bound to be contented.
    <br>At God's time, everything looks beautiful.
    <br>TB Joshua's Hidden Secrets EXPOSED!!!
    <br>When you learn what God has made you for,
    <br>how He treasures your company,
    <br>you will be contented.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>You are what God says you are.
    <br>When you learn what you are made for,
    <br>you will know you can do, what God says you can do.
    <br>You have what God says you have.
    <br>If you are what God says you are, why should you be looking at others?
    <br>Why should you compare yourself to others?
    <br>Why should you now begin to measure yourself?
    <br>No one and nobody is like you.
    <br>That is God's master plan,
    <br>that no one, nobody is like you.
    <br>That is why even in the face of trial, tribulation, blackmail, whatever,
    <br>I'm still the same person you know.
    <br>My emotions do not change because I know where I'm going.
    <br>THIS IS MY STORY
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>Imagine the rumours and gossip that spread as a result of this incident.
    <br>A prophet detained in a cell for taking drugs and harbouring weapons.
    <br>However his enemies soon noticed, that not even the detention in a cell and false accusations
    <br>would shake his faith in God.
    <br>To the wise this was a foolish thing, but God used it to reveal His purpose in the life of T.B. Joshua,
    <br>giving him the necessary experience and maturity to handle the greater responsibilities
    <br>God was preparing for him.
    <br>Like Joseph in the Bible; he has learnt what it is to be loved, hated, rejected, enslaved
    <br>accused and falsely convicted.
    <br>He bore everything that happened to him calmly.
    <br>This is the letter from the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency
    <br>confirming the innocence of T.B. Joshua,
    <br>and clearing him from the charge of drug dealing, for which he was detained in a cell for 13 days.
    <br>Remember, our enemies may rob us of our liberty and confine us in a prison cell,
    <br>but they cannot shut us out of the throne of mercy and communion with God.
    <br>Falsely accused of drug dealing by the (NDLEA) National Drug Law Enforcement Agency,
    <br>T.B. Joshua was arrested and held in a cell for 13 days.
    <br>This is the first appearance of T.B. Joshua, having just been released from the cell.
    <br>He addressed the congregation thanking them for their faithfulness and love,
    <br>for standing by him in the hard times, referring to their unequal effort towards his absence.
    <br>You can see the man of God T.B. Joshua looking lean, having spent 13 days in a cell.
    <br>I am using this opportunity to thank you all for your unequal efforts towards my absence.
    <br>I am here to thank you all.
    <br>God Almighty will continue to be with you.
    <br>If you say to yourself, “Why me of all this trouble, persecution, tribulation and all sort of things?",
    <br>I want you to think back and ask, “Why me of all these spiritual blessings in my life?”
    <br>When you count the blessings of God in your life, doubt will fly away.
    <br>Even if you are suffering acutely and you lack of this and that, remember the blessings of God
    <br>like food, shelter and many others you are enjoying today.
    <br>Having searched and found nothing against him, T.B. Joshua was released from the cell,
    <br>and the following Sunday appeared in the church service to thank the members
    <br>and appreciate their love and support during his absence.
    <br>Rather than to complain and query, "Why me of all this trouble and persecution?", T.B. Joshua encouraged
    <br>the congregation to remember the spiritual blessings many are denied of, such as food and shelter,
    <br>that they can hold the very Word of God in their hands, and read it,
    <br>that they have the knowledge of His saving grace.
    <br>The man of God encouraged them saying, "When you begin to count your blessings, your doubts will fly away".
    <br>No one and nobody is like you.
    <br>That is God's master plan,
    <br>that no one, nobody is like you.
    <br>That is why even in the face of trial, tribulation, blackmail, whatever,
    <br>I'm still the same person you know.
    <br>My emotions do not change because I know where I'm going.
    <br>Good life is not found in the market, in the street - it is God's plan for you.
    <br>I began discovering the good life when I was only 15 years old.
    <br>It's all about love and be loved.
    <br>Help and be helped.
    <br>Show mercy and receive mercy.
    <br>Be kind and receive kindness.
    <br>Give and receive more of whatever you give.
    <br>My objective and motives were determined at once.
    <br>I wanted what God wanted and I wanted it for the reason God wanted it.
    <br>Those principles anchored me throughout my life and my teenage years.
    <br>Since that time, they have always guided me.
    <br>Love and be loved.
    <br>Help and be helped.
    <br>Show mercy and receive mercy.
    <br>Be kind and receive kindness.
    <br>Give and receive more of whatever you give.
    <br>That is what the good life is all about.
    <br>We should not allow unhealthy ego, pride or greed to overrule our good intention.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"We should not allow unhealthy ego, pride or greed to overrule our good intention."
    <br>People want to give and love but the way they go about it with ego...
    <br>The manner you give matters.
    <br>After you give, you want to be in the position where they can come and say,
    <br>"Thank you, sir, for what you have done yesterday."
    <br>Those who have the greatest and most positive impact on society
    <br>are not concerned with name and fame.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be determined".
    <br>- I can't hear you.
    <br>- [Be determined.]
    <br>Yes, be determined.
    <br>THIS IS MY STORY
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>This is Prophet T.B. Joshua's first crusade in 1992.
    <br>Listen to him as he addresses the people in his local dialect.
    <br>Our Father in Heaven, the sins of Your children that are hindering them
    <br>from receiving Your blessing; cleanse them with Your blood.
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>Clap for Jesus.
    <br>We are in a small crusade now, but in the future, it's going to be big!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesies to the people saying, we are in a small crusade now,
    <br>but in the future, it is going to be big.
    <br>One might question why a church of just a small number in the outskirts of Lagos Nigeria
    <br>should be called The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>But this is the vision God had given to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>God is not a man that disappoints.
    <br>Botswana Crusade 2005
    <br>South Korea Crusade 2005
    <br>Australia Crusade 2006
    <br>Singapore Crusade 2006
    <br>Indonesia Crusade 2007
    <br>Every Sunday, The SCOAN's services are broadcast to millions around the globe through Emmanuel TV
    <br>and the cathedral is always filled to capacity with worshippers from across Nigeria and the world.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is a man of faith
    <br>and the journey of The SCOAN is a journey of faith.
    <br>Those who have the greatest and most positive impact on society
    <br>are not concerned with name and fame.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Be determined".
    <br>- I can't hear you.
    <br>- [Be determined.]
    <br>Yes, be determined.
    <br>Every day you must stay true to your purpose in life,
    <br>despite snow or rain.
    <br>It is not when there's pleasure, when the goings are good that they see good in you
    <br>but when the situation is a bit difficult.
    <br>Every day you must stay true to your purpose, despite snow or rain.
    <br>When your purpose is clear, your life will have meaning.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When your purpose is clear, your life will have meaning."
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>[When your purpose is clear, your life will have meaning.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[When your purpose is clear, your life will have meaning.]
    <br>We only show that purpose when the goings are good.
    <br>When our purpose is clear, our life will have meaning.
    <br>Be determined.
    <br>In the early stage of our ministry, there was almost no media coverage.
    <br>And you know the weapon of propaganda.
    <br>Campaign of calumny - if you want to destroy, it is a weapon.
    <br>If you want to build - as well.
    <br>I was almost misunderstood.
    <br>Detractors capitalised on this to misinform the world about me and my ministry.
    <br>THIS IS MY STORY
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>These are a selection from the numerous newspapers and magazines
    <br>both Nigerian and international
    <br>that have carried blasphemous lies, slanderous remarks and wicked allegations
    <br>against Prophet T.B. Joshua and The SCOAN.
    <br>Throughout the years, since the onset of T.B. Joshua's ministry till this present day,
    <br>stories continued to appear in magazines, newspapers and internet websites,
    <br>each with a different accusation, rumour or allegation.
    <br>The controversial ministry of T.B. Joshua has attracted varied attention from the media worldwide,
    <br>such that many have come to the church to make enquiries for themselves.
    <br>Despite all the controversy or the negative press and all the accusations,
    <br>the ministry of T.B. Joshua continues to grow and increase.
    <br>An international newspaper published a malicious rumour in the March 28, 2010 edition
    <br>about a fake prophetic message supposedly given by Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>It reads:
    <br>Tales of doom far too tall.
    <br>A televangelist's morbid prediction thankfully falls flat.
    <br>An excerpt from this article reads:
    <br>What exercised their minds was a prophecy, a rumour, it turns out,
    <br>by televangelist TB Joshua that a million-plus Zimbabweans were going to perish
    <br>on the first Saturday of March 2010.
    <br>These are just a few of the kinds of lies, deceptions and blasphemies
    <br>published in newspapers and magazines both within Nigeria and around the world.
    <br>Let us remember the wise saying of Gamaliel when he addressed the Jewish council
    <br>in Acts 5:34-39.
    <br>Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel,
    <br>a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people,
    <br>and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while.
    <br>And he said to them, “Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men.
    <br>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone;
    <br>for if this plan or this work is of men, it will come to nothing;
    <br>but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it - lest you even be found to fight against God.”
    <br>In the early stage of our ministry, there was almost no media coverage
    <br>and you know the weapon of propaganda.
    <br>Campaign of calumny - if you want to destroy, it is a weapon.
    <br>If you want to build - as well.
    <br>I was almost misunderstood.
    <br>Detractors capitalised on this to misinform the world about me and my ministry.
    <br>My people, listen:
    <br>We overcame by keeping our purpose in the forefront of our minds.
    <br>We overcame by keeping our purpose, our vision and mission
    <br>in the forefront of our minds.
    <br>You know what it means when you keep something...
    <br>Nothing and nothing - it is a sacred place.
    <br>We are here today.
    <br>We are celebrating today because focus was not broken.
    <br>TB Joshua's Hidden Secrets EXPOSED!!!
    <br>Broken focus is a reason for what?
    <br>We are celebrating, we are here today because focus was not broken
    <br>in the midst of storms and pleasure as well.
    <br>In the midst of storms, trials and pleasures, we never allowed wordly praises,
    <br>fame or wealth to control us.
    <br>Like many who leave the less privileged community and go to a privileged community,
    <br>because of money.
    <br>Why should you abandon your people?
    <br>It is the money that dictates our direction instead of the Giver of the money.
    <br>When the money comes, we change our vehicle, house, we begin to change our wardrobe.
    <br>Money has come - people in the world would know,
    <br>"This man - money has come to him. Look at the vehicle, the car, everything..."
    <br>A resolve to do whatever proper thing it takes
    <br>separates the weak from the strong.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"A resolve to do whatever proper thing it takes
    <br>separates the weak from the strong."
    <br>The strong are determined to do whatever possible and proper thing
    <br>to get to their goal.
    <br>Let someone say, "Challenges".
    <br>- I cannot hear you.
    <br>- [Challenges.]
    <br>Challenges!
    <br>THIS IS MY STORY
    <br>PROPHET T.B. JOSHUA
    <br>During the early years of his ministry, Prophet T.B. Joshua did not have a vehicle to move around.
    <br>He walked almost everywhere he went for two years.
    <br>The children surrounding Prophet T.B. Joshua were among those he gathered to follow him,
    <br>as he went to form the first Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>TB Joshua's Hidden Secrets EXPOSED!!!
    <br>This is the first site and the first structure of the Synagogue Church Of All Nations,
    <br>where Prophet T.B. Joshua, having just returned from the prayer mountain, lays the foundation of the church
    <br>located in Agodo-Egbe, Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua walks joyfully among the members, as he lifts their faith with the Word of God.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>In fact, I don't know where to start.
    <br>My coming into your midst is just to lay a foundation.
    <br>Today, we start the Synagogue here!
    <br>1989
    <br>1st Church
    <br>When you look at the Book of John 9 - start from verse 6.
    <br>"Having said this, He spat on the ground and made some mud with the saliva and put it on the man's eyes.
    <br>Go, He told him, wash in the pool of Siloam (this word means Sent).
    <br>Worshippers gathered at the second church building of The SCOAN,
    <br>that was built to accommodate the increasing number of members.
    <br>2nd Church
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua moves in their midst and prays for them.
    <br>2nd Church
    <br>Due to a violent thunderstorm, the second church building of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations
    <br>was completely destroyed.
    <br>2nd Church
    <br>After the second church building was destroyed, another building was built;
    <br>this time using wooden planks.
    <br>The first church service was held at the new building of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations in 1992.
    <br>The man you are seeing now, although difficult to recognise, is Prophet T.B. Joshua at the age of 29,
    <br>ministering to the members.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua’s First Church Service at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations, 1992
    <br>Here is Prophet T.B. Joshua surveying the church premises after heavy rain,

    <br>TB Joshua's Hidden Secrets EXPOSED!!!
    <br>Due to the increasing number of worshippers attending the church,
    <br>the Holy Spirit instructed Prophet T.B. Joshua to move to a new location,
    <br>to accommodate the influx of new worshippers.
    <br>In 1994, the church moved to Ikotun-Egbe, Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>This is the forth building of The Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>The first building at the new site.

    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>4th Church
    <br>Inside the church are thousands of people joyfully receiving the Word of God.
    <br>After the service the man of God returns by motorcycle to his personal place of sanctuary,
    <br>his own prayer mountain, located 15 minutes from the church.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Riding In A Truck
    <br>A resolve to do whatever proper thing it takes
    <br>separates the weak from the strong.
    <br>The strong are determined to do whatever possible and proper thing
    <br>to get to their goal.
    <br>Let someone say, "Challenges".
    <br>- I cannot hear you.
    <br>- [Challenges.]
    <br>At some level in life, we all hunger for meaning in our lives.
    <br>"What is the purpose of life? Why am I living life? I have come all the way long."
    <br>In order not to end up like the masses out there who are merely wandering
    <br>and unsure of their goal and dream, listen.
    <br>We are not talking about money
    <br>because money is a small slice of life.
    <br>Money cannot give us that joy and peace we are talking about.
    <br>If you are focused only on making money,
    <br>a large slice of life will pass you by.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you are focused only on making money,
    <br>a large slice of life will pass you by."
    <br>That is, a very very important part of life will pass you by.
    <br>This is why you see people having riches without joy.
    <br>Money, without essentials of life.
    <br>Our goal must reflect our purpose.
    <br>When you serve a purpose larger than yourself,
    <br>your commitment will increase.
    <br>In order not to end up like the masses out there who are merely wandering
    <br>and unsure of their goal and dream,
    <br>your objective must be clear.
    <br>When your purpose is clear, your life will have meaning.
    <br>Let others hate you but not you because nobody is like you.
    <br>You are not like others.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Let others hate you but not you because you are not like others."
    <br>Others can judge you but not you.
    <br>Let others judge you but not you.
    <br>Everything you have is actually being borrowed from God.
    <br>What we are seeking for now, is already a past tense.
    <br>Healing, deliverance, salvation are past victories.
    <br>It is already there.
    <br>Adopting a lifestyle that is on purpose provides
    <br>an opportunity to enrich others by leaving your imprint in a positive way.
    <br>When you are able to expand this philosophy to a wider vision
    <br>your purpose will crystallize.
    <br>"Not today. Forget about it. When the money comes." Next time you will begin to help. - No!
    <br>Stay true!
    <br>Huge trailers pull up outside The SCOAN loaded to the brim with thousands of bags of top quality rice.
    <br>First Trailer Of Rice
    <br>Second Trailer Of Rice
    <br>Appearing on a regular basis, this rice is meant for the needy, the physically challenged,
    <br>the widows, the widowers, the little people, the orphans, and those who need it most.
    <br>Through this medium God has been using the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to meet one of life's greatest basic needs - the need for food.
    <br>Upon arrival, the Emmanuel TV team greets the trucks
    <br>and one by one the bags of rice are unloaded and stacked in the store room in thousands.
    <br>This is the rice stacked and ready to be used as a channel of blessing where there is want in life.
    <br>With the rice repacked in Emmanuel TV bags,
    <br>these professional bagging machines are used to stitch the top of the rice sacks
    <br>in order to tightly seal them.
    <br>The re.bagging is successfully completed and the bags are moved into the church, all set for distribution.
    <br>It is all for the physically challenged, the widows and widowers,
    <br>the little people, the orphans and the elderly.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua greets them personally to show them they are loved.
    <br>New school uniforms are hand-tailored and given to these students
    <br>and the brand new bus was given to this community, in order to carry their children to school.
    <br>These are orphans from one of the many orphanages around the country,
    <br>that come to the church for sponsorship, rice and financial support.
    <br>Having established The SCOAN Little People Association,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua regularly gives scholarships to those among them pursuing higher education,
    <br>as well as house rent and business start-up finances.
    <br>Without this support they would have continued to live their dire existence on the streets
    <br>without any hope for the future or a decent life.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV team has become a source of refuge and hope for those little people.
    <br>Large stacks of rice sit at the feet of these widows;
    <br>having been distributed by the Emmanuel TV team, they give thanks to God
    <br>for truly showing Himself as the Chief Husband Man.
    <br>Emmanuel TV team members assisted thousands of widows to carry their bags of rice.
    <br>There is no love that does not express itself in giving.
    <br>When we are giving truly for God's sake, we will receive more of whatever we give.
    <br>Since the inception of this ministry, this is the way and manner
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua has been making a difference in the world around him.
    <br>Widows and Widowers
    <br>T.B. Joshua endeavours to copy the example of Christ,
    <br>who is never tired of doing good,
    <br>helps the widows and widowers to take their rice bags to their seats, aided by the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>These are the elderly;
    <br>many now abandoned and rejected by their families and communities.
    <br>This man was rescued from near death conditions
    <br>and given a new lease on life by the Emmanuel TV team.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Receiving love, care, food and financial support from the Emmanuel TV team and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>During his historic crusade in the nation of Indonesia,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua reached out to a huge crowd of homeless individuals and families
    <br>and distributed hot meals and financial support.
    <br>This group of physically challenged athletes came to the church for help
    <br>and were sponsored with assistance to pay for visas
    <br>and tickets to fly to Spain for a competition.
    <br>Escorted to the airport, they entered the plane, giving thanks to God
    <br>for using Prophet T.B. Joshua as a channel of shining light
    <br>that enabled them to enter a bright future.
    <br>TB Joshua's Hidden Secrets EXPOSED!!!
    <br>Flocking into the church are thousands of physically challenged individuals
    <br>suffering different ailments and disabilities,
    <br>who have heard that there is a place where their needs can be met and their hopes renewed -
    <br>the house of God.
    <br>They come using crutches, rolling on skateboards,
    <br>having no other means of transporting themselves due to their physical problems.
    <br>They enter the church with expectations high for their meeting with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Physically Challenged
    <br>This is one of the many buses sent out by Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to provide transport to the needy for the meeting.
    <br>As it encourages us, we are called to commit more faith and love into the society of which we are a part
    <br>by spending more on others and less on ourselves;
    <br>our love, strength, money and every good thing the Lord has given us.
    <br>With a growing rate of orphans and university dropouts, divorce and poverty,
    <br>the church cannot afford to sit on the fence.
    <br>This is why Emmanuel TV believes that God always wants to express His mission
    <br>of love through us to others.
    <br>Therefore, we are called to respond to all human needs,
    <br>for that is what love entails.
    <br>Physically Challenged
    <br>This row of blind students receives rice and assistance
    <br>and is led by Prophet T.B. Joshua through the church.
    <br>Truly, quality smiles are being restored to the faces and hearts of these individuals.
    <br>Many who cannot walk are lifted into new wheelchairs.
    <br>This young man has been rescued from a life in a wheelbarrow.
    <br>Imagine such an existence.
    <br>And this young man covered in dust from rolling himself along the ground in efforts to move
    <br>is also lifted to a new life.
    <br>You can see the way he rolled to move around in the past.
    <br>For this womanm the new wheelchair puts her in the position of new authority.
    <br>She used to crawl beside her five children.
    <br>This gift puts her in the position to supervise and protect her children.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>It is our duty to take care of the needy in our midst.
    <br>There is a promise of God attached to this,
    <br>for what we give for the relief of the needy and the support of God's worship
    <br>is actually given onto God.
    <br>When we give in truth for God's sake, we will receive more of whatever we give.
    <br>As these individuals make their way out of the meeting,
    <br>they go with smiles on their faces, joy in their hearts, provisions for their table
    <br>and the key for their bright future.
    <br>This is the evidence of Jesus Christ - lives changed.
    <br>And this has been the standard of Prophet T.B. Joshua's ministry from the beginning,
    <br>knowing that as Christians all our considerations, aspirations and heart desires
    <br>must be subject to the Gospel by works of charity.
    <br>Adopting such a lifestyle that is on purpose produces an opportunity to enrich others
    <br>by leaving their imprint in a positive way.
    <br>As these individuals leave the meetings, they give thanks to God for the positive impact
    <br>the ministry of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV has had on their lives;
    <br>all for the glory of God.
    <br>Adopting a lifestyle that is on purpose provides
    <br>an opportunity to enrich others by leaving your imprint in a positive way.
    <br>When you are able to expand this philosophy to a wider vision,
    <br>your purpose will crystallize.
    <br>"Not today. Forget about it. When the money comes." Next time you will begin to help. - No!
    <br>Stay true, despite snow or rain.
    <br>When you are able to expand this philosophy to a wider vision,
    <br>your purpose will crystallize.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Discovering your purpose".
    <br>Many people do not have a well defined purpose.
    <br>To help you figuring out yours, here are some probing questions:
    <br>The plan of God is for you to move from one ladder to another
    <br>because your responsibilities increase every day,
    <br>so your position should also increase to meet the need.
    <br>But what has happened today?
    <br>If our position does not increase but your responsibility increases,
    <br>definitely you are bound to do like others in order to meet up.
    <br>If I'm not moving forward or backward, and I get stuck, you would not be here today.
    <br>If I'm not moving forward or backward, if I get stuck, what will I do?
    <br>There are many people you know as 'big men', very rich men
    <br>but they have got stuck.
    <br>They could not move forward or backward but they are still rich to the standard of...
    <br>Economic meltdown.
    <br>If you meet them, they are crying.
    <br>You call them "rich, wealthy men", but when you meet them one on one
    <br>and they open up to you, they are crying.
    <br>They have pain, many responsibilities they cannot meet up with.
    <br>You will say, "This is the man I said is the richest man in the world.
    <br>He is crying, complaining. God!"
    <br>Because a situation where you are not moving forward or backward and you get stuck
    <br>is a dangerous situation.
    <br>Then you cannot expand.
    <br>Many marriages get stuck, cannot move forward or backward.
    <br>Many businesses cannot move forward or backward.
    <br>Many relationships cannot move forward or backward.
    <br>And many ministries cannot move forward or backward, they get stuck.
    <br>When one gets stuck, knowing that when something gets stuck...
    <br>When you throw a stone up, it gets to a point and then comes down.
    <br>In order not to come down finally, what is the solution?
    <br>Because when you get stuck, you are only left with what you have.
    <br>It is the circle of life - it goes like this.
    <br>Many families get stuck.
    <br>When you meet many families, they will say, there is limitation in their home.
    <br>There is a certain level they cannot reach or pass.
    <br>If they are about to get there, it is either they get sick or die.
    <br>Many families, at the time they are trying to go up,
    <br>at a certain level in life, they go back to the village.
    <br>Retirement.
    <br>Many families are like that.
    <br>Even many nations, countries get stuck.
    <br>When one gets stuck, they begin to take the one 'in reserve'.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Now, let's talk about individuals.
    <br>If one gets stuck, what is the way out?
    <br>If one cannot move forward or backward, what is the way out?
    <br>Listen to this:
    <br>Consider taking some days off and go for a short retreat.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Consider taking some days off and go for a short retreat."
    <br>This is the way you can sit down and look at what you do with your life.
    <br>It is not to go and begin to say, "In Jesus' name... Amen".
    <br>You are talking to Jesus but you never allow Jesus to talk to you.
    <br>They say, "Amen. In Jesus' name..."
    <br>The problem of many Christians today is that we are very good in talking to Jesus
    <br>but we never allow Jesus to talk to us.
    <br>It is impossible to make excellent decisions when you are caught up
    <br>in the whirl of everyday activities.
    <br>A tired mind cannot make a good decision.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "A tired mind cannot make a good decision."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[A tired mind cannot make a good decision.]
    <br>That is why you have to consider taking some days off and going for a short retreat.
    <br>In order to live life to the fullest, your goal must reflect your purpose.
    <br>There are many questions you need to ask yourself when you are in the retreat.
    <br>"Do I have a sense of entitlement?
    <br>Am I a 'magnet' for men and women?
    <br>Do they love my personality or my money?"
    <br>To be a 'magnet' - when you do like this, do they love you?
    <br>Those are the questions you need to ask yourself.
    <br>"Am I a 'magnet' for women or men?
    <br>Do they love my personality, my money, my power?
    <br>Is my integrity in check?"
    <br>Many questions you ask yourself before you will begin to open your mouth and pray.
    <br>"Am I surrounded with 'yes men' or 'yes women' with very little accountability?"
    <br>Today, Christians in general just believe, when they go to a retreat...
    <br>No!
    <br>You need to reconcile.
    <br>Look into your past, present and future.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
