    <br>WARNING!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The footage you are about to watch is of a sensitive nature
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>and although it may not be suitable for all viewers, it is for the glory of God.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Mr Boniface Nwaokolo has come to the emergency section of The SCOAN
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>in dire need of God's healing mercy due to the terrible problem of tongue cancer
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>that has tormented his life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Look at the cancer on the tongue.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>That is terrible and deadly.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>There is nothing this man can do with his mouth at all with that cancer on the tongue.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Mr Boniface Nwaokolo stands to his feet as the moment has come for his divine encounter
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>with the Miracle Worker, Jesus Christ.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua stretches forth his hand in the name of Jesus,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>the curse of sickness and affliction in his life is broken.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The root cause of the problem of tongue cancer has been commanded out in the name above all names.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He is free.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>After his healing, the cancer on his tongue disappeared, and a few days later,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Mr Boniface Nwaokolo came back to The SCOAN to share his wonderful testimony.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>What a radical transformation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The tongue that was totally disfigured by the open cancerous wound has been restored to its
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>perfect original condition after the touch from heaven through the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>A closer look at the tongue of Mr Boniface shows that when Jesus heals,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He heals effectually, He heals completely.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Looking at his tongue now, one could never imagine that he once suffered
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>from the terrible problem of tongue cancer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Further demonstrating his healing, he touches the area on his tongue where the cancer once was.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>- Can you feel any pain?
    <br>- No.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>- Could you press it like that before?
    <br>- No, I couldn't press it before.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>My name is Boniface Nwaokolo.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was tongue cancer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This was a problem I had never seen in my life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It disturbed me to the extent that I couldn't eat, drink or have peace of mind.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I couldn't sleep.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>This problem had taken me to so many places - chemists and hospitals.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>The last hospital I attended said I would have to be operated on.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I thought to myself, "I have never seen such a thing - the tongue being operated on."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>All my hope was gone.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Whenever I went home, I would encourage my family.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Even the doctor told me to hurry, saying that the problem could kill.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>By God's grace, I met someone and told her about the problem I had.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>She advised me that the problem would be solved if I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I said, "Synagogue?" She said, "Yes."
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>On that day, I woke up very early.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I didn't know about this place before.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I came here with faith.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When I got to the gate, I was taken to the emergency section.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua came out, he looked at my tongue.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He told me to stand up, which I did.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>He stretched forth his hand and prayed for me.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Immediately, the severe headache I was having went away.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>All the symptoms I was experiencing disappeared.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Afterwards, he told me to go, that I was free.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Going home that day, I went back with joy because I saw changes in my body.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I didn't pay any money; they even gave me money.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>How is the condition right now?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>I am very fine!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Let us see the tongue; seeing is believing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>BEFORE | AFTER
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Overcome with joy at God's divine mercy in his life, Mr Boniface Nwaokolo
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>proudly touches his tongue and confirms all the pain has gone.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Now free from the cancer that made it impossible for him to even eat, drink or live a normal life,
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>Mr Boniface Nwaokolo is now restored.
    <br>
