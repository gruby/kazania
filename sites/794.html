  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I know you are feeling His presence.
    <br>Where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Give thanks to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have many people here today that are waiting for healing.
    <br>As we were dancing, singing, they were unable because of the pain and affliction.
    <br>I think the best way to celebrate this Palm Sunday is to bless them with healing and deliverance.
    <br>So that the coming one, they can be happy to celebrate it.
    <br>That is the purpose of Palm Sunday.
    <br>Really.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Make sure people are happy, just as you are.
    <br>Are you happy?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "I want to make sure you are happy as I am!"
    <br>[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]
    <br>Tell the viewers all over the world.
    <br>[I want to make sure you are happy as I am]
    <br>Tell the viewers all over the world - they are there.
    <br>[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]
    <br>Those on the sickbed.
    <br>Many are on the sickbed, and they are watching you.
    <br>Can you please tell them.
    <br>You want to make sure they are happy as you are.
    <br>[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]
    <br>Many are in the prison yard. Tell them.
    <br>[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]
    <br>Those on the air, watching the programme, tell them.
    <br>[I want to make sure you are happy as I am!]
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You can only give that happiness when you have it.
    <br>That is why Christians have to be happy.
    <br>When you are not happy, you cannot give.
    <br>It is what you have that you can give out of.
    <br>You cannot give all - you can only give out of what you have.
    <br>When you are not happy, you cannot.
    <br>Even when you give money - when you are not happy and you now give money to your neighbour,
    <br>it is like you are giving sorrow.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you are not happy and you are rich
    <br>and your neighbor runs to you for help and you are not happy,
    <br>whatever you give out of that unhappiness is sorrow.
    <br>Your neighbour cannot use it for anything.
    <br>Therefore, what you've been giving in the past - think about it.
    <br>The mood you were in when you were giving those things.
    <br>Whatever you give that is not joyful is not from God.
    <br>Happiness can only come from God.
    <br>Whatever that is out of unhappiness is not from God.
    <br>If you pretend to smile and you are not happy - that is not from God.
    <br>This is why many things you are giving out - there is no reward from God -
    <br>because you are not giving it out of God.
    <br>You are giving something and after giving it, you are now saying to yourself,
    <br>"Oh! Had I known, I would not have given this.
    <br>Oh, my God. Well, I have to give it because they will do this or that to me".
    <br>It means you are not giving it out of God.
    <br>You cannot expect a reward from God and God is the Rewarder.
    <br>Or you greet a brother of yours, "Good Morning, sir!"
    <br>He says, "Oh, thank you!" After your brother turns his back, you do this...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see why you have not been receiving rewards?
    <br>You are a good giver but no rewards.
    <br>Or in the past, you trained many people to university, to college, you assisted many.
    <br>In those days, many of your younger ones lived with you.
    <br>You trained them. Now some of them have become great.
    <br>If you remember when you were training them, you gave out of unhappiness.
    <br>Some of them when you gave them money, you threw it - "I have to give you, stupid boy!"
    <br>"Foolish boy!" You just had to give them.
    <br>Today they are becoming great.
    <br>But something is telling them that they should just leave you the way you are.
    <br>If you had given all those things out of God...
    <br>God is the Rewarder.
    <br>You have not been helping out of God.
    <br>You help but not out of God.
    <br>You give but not out of God.
    <br>You give out of complaining.
    <br>You greet out of complaining, grumbling.
    <br>You smile out of grumbling.
    <br>It is better not to give than to give out of grumbling.
    <br>You help someone with millions of dollars out of grumbling.
    <br>You cannot expect a reward from God.
    <br>Your grumbling is not of God.
    <br>The act that follows that help will determine the kind of help you give.
    <br>I want to help you. How are you?
    <br>Let me help you!
    <br>It is not that help that matters but the force that follows that help.
    <br>It's not that help I'm doing but the force behind it will determine the kind of reward I will receive.
    <br>But people seeing us will say, "Oh, this man is very kind. He helped this man to stand up.
    <br>Look at him - very humble".
    <br>"Let's go." The man cannot walk. "Oh, very humble."
    <br>What is wrong with you?
    <br>Thank you. The man cannot walk.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This man - eh! Everything - "Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You see me. Maybe I am just wearing a simple dress.
    <br>You are not expecting me to wear this and you say, "The man is humble".
    <br>Who told you I am humble because I wear a rag?
    <br>I can be very proud and at the same time wear a simple thing.
    <br>It is not what you see but the force behind what you see.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[It is not what you see but the force behind what you see.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[It is not what you see but the force behind what you see.]
    <br>This is why the Bible says: We don't walk by sight; we walk by faith.
    <br>What I am seeing now - "A very humble, gentle man."
    <br>"Look at the simple dress."
    <br>Do you know the force behind what he is doing?
    <br>Look at money.
    <br>If you put blood money down and clean money, would you be able to know the difference?
    <br>When there is no blood on the money?
    <br>Maybe someone just went out to rob, killed the person and carried millions of dollars
    <br>and now wants to use this as charity.
    <br>But it is money you will see -
    <br>you don't know where he brought the money from, and the money is clean as well - the godly one too.
    <br>If you now see them side by side, you won't know the difference.
    <br>It is the force behind the money that determines the type of money it is.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The force behind a man determines the type of man he is.
    <br>"A very humble man, what a godly man" - and yet he is not godly.
    <br>"He is a leader, he likes God - a humble and very good man."
    <br>Who told you he is good, who told you he is humble?
    <br>It is the force, and this force - we cannot see it with our eyes.
    <br>It is the force that determines the reward.
    <br>This is why sometimes you say, "This man is trying, working harder; why is he suffering?"
    <br>Who told you he is trying, he is working harder
    <br>when we are not judged by what we see but what we cannot see.
    <br>As a believer, you are not judged by going to church, by reading the Bible.
    <br>This is why we say "spirit of humility", "spirit of goodness".
    <br>If those spirits are removed, anybody can demonstrate whatever you call it.
    <br>You can pretend to be humble.
    <br>The spirit behind it would determine whether you are pretending or not.
    <br>People like me, I'm scared when it is time for thanksgiving
    <br>because I don't know where you are coming from with your money.
    <br>Many can come with blood money.
    <br>When it is time for offering, they would raise their offering whereas it is blood money.
    <br>What can the man of God use that kind of blood money for?
    <br>Is he going to bless the man?
    <br>This is why we, ministers of God, have so much to do.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: What we received from our members as offering, thanksgiving is killing us.
    <br>[What we received from our members as offering, thanksgiving is killing us.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you see money carried in the church - offering money - the bowl is full of money,
    <br>inside that - there is good and killer inside.
    <br>Wicked people like the pastor to ask.
    <br>When the pastor does not ask, they cannot give.
    <br>When the pastor does not ask and recognise them, they cannot give.
    <br>They like praise, they like recognition.
    <br>If you want to do away and avoid these people, these people will not put money inside.
    <br>Don't praise them! Let them know it is to God they give and not to you.
    <br>Don't even receive it directly!
    <br>If you don't receive something directly from the killer,
    <br>the killer will not give you because he wants to be recognised.
    <br>They like praise - that is their reward - because they have no reward from God.
    <br>Their reward is that praise to know them and to recognise them; it is their reward.
    <br>What comes from God goes to God.
    <br>If what you have is from God, it will go to God.
    <br>You don't need any recognition from the pastor - whatever you want to give to God, you give.
    <br>Look at me, I'm moving.
    <br>It's not this movement that matters but the force behind this movement
    <br>determines whether I am moving of God or I am moving of satan.
    <br>Now I want to pray for this man. I am walking towards him.
    <br>This movement does not matter but the force - who is leading you,
    <br>what force is behind this move will determine the reward!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No one can get healed without faith.
    <br>If I am coming and I have doubt in my heart - "Will this man be healed?" - and that doubt fills my heart,
    <br>if I pray for this man, I will ask him to come back tomorrow.
    <br>That is the method of doubt - "Come back again tomorrow and let us see your condition."
    <br>When faith is now, faith acts now, believes now, confesses now.
    <br>Faith acts now.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Faith acts now.]
    <br>Faith heals now.
    <br>Faith delivers now.
    <br>Faith blesses now.
    <br>That is faith!
    <br>Faith is present tense.
    <br>And if you're not of God - there's no neutral place - if you are not of God, you are of satan.
    <br>If you are of God, then you will be filled with faith
    <br>because only faith moves, talks and walks with Him.
    <br>If you are not of God, you will be filled with doubt.
    <br>I want to pray with you.
    <br>Doubt: "Will this prayer be answered? Would God answer me?" Because I am not of Him.
    <br>If I now pray, it's not going to happen.
    <br>The only excuse I will give you is to come back.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't let us deceive ourselves.
    <br>90% of your action cannot be judged on the outside
    <br>but the force behind your action determines where your action comes from.
    <br>Everybody says, "In the name of Jesus!"
    <br>They cannot just because of that say that they are calling Jesus.
    <br>You can be calling Jesus but the force behind that calling is of satan.
    <br>You don't need a licence to call the name Jesus.
    <br>But when you call Him genuinely, you need a licence from Jesus.
    <br>When you call Jesus genuinely, you need what? - Licence.
    <br>A licence means you will be adopted by the Holy Spirit to call that name genuinely.
    <br>In the same vein, you are free to have a copy of the Bible.
    <br>All you need is money. If you have that money, just walk into the bookshop.
    <br>They will not ask you whether you are a Christian or whatever.
    <br>They need money to give you a copy of the Bible.
    <br>When we know this, we will be able to train our children, ourselves and our friends.
    <br>Don't let anybody deceive you with their appearance
    <br>or when they say, "Good Morning, sir!"
    <br>After that "Good Morning, sir", you can turn your back and they will be the ones to kill you.
    <br>Or somebody responsible for a death - while people are crying, he, the killer, will now come back.
    <br>He will rush there and start crying.
    <br>He would be the one to cry and jump around and people will say, "Don't die, it's alright!"
    <br>whereas he is the one that killed the deceased.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Is that not action?
    <br>He would cry genuinely, tears would come out - not that he pretends - you will see tears coming out.
    <br>He would be the one joining them, shouting, crying, "He is my brother, my dear friend"
    <br>- and he would be cursing the person who killed the man:
    <br>"God will do this, God will do that!", and he is the one that...
    <br>What do we do about this?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the service, you can call the name Jesus a million times -
    <br>just as a demonstration to show people that you are a believer, a true man of God.
    <br>So, please...
    <br>It is the force behind accomplishment.
    <br>The force behind what? - Accomplishment.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God loves you. Thank you.
    <br>Viewers, thank you.
