    <br>PRAYER TIME
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can you go from God's presence? Whether you are in the north, east, south or west, get ready to pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>God can touch you wherever you are by faith. Anywhere you are, touch your screen and begin to confess your freedom, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Right now, let us pray for the viewers all over the world.
    <br>We want to let them know that we are aware that they are watching.
    <br>There is no difference between over there and here.
    <br>So, stretch your hand.
    <br>Father, we pray for the viewers all over the world that are there.
    <br>Whatever medium that they are using to watch this programme,
    <br>on the Internet, in whatever way, wherever you are, all over the world,
    <br>east, south, north, west,
    <br>I pray right now, anywhere you are, whatever position you are in.
    <br>Are you on the sickbed or inside the house, bedroom, restroom?
    <br>Anywhere you are - where can you go from His presence?
    <br>I say to you, in the name of Jesus -
    <br>that bondage in your life - be thou loosed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That affliction in your life - be thou loosed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thou poverty, hardship, limitation in progress - be thou loosed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Setback, marital problems - be thou loosed, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Those of you on the sickbed, receive your healing!
    <br>I command you to be free!
    <br>I command you to be released!
    <br>Be delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Enough is enough to that hardship!
    <br>Enough is enough to that bondage!
    <br>Enough is enough to that sickness and disease!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ, you face them no more!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Right now, anywhere you are, begin to share your testimony.
    <br>I'm healed; Jesus is my Healer!
    <br>As you confess this, be delivered!
    <br>As you confess this, be healed!
    <br>As you confess this, be released!
    <br>Right now, begin to confess this!
    <br>The Lord wants you to confess them and receive!
    <br>I'm healed; Jesus is my Healer!
    <br>I'm delivered; Jesus is my Deliverer!
    <br>I'm redeemed; Jesus is my Redeemer!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Let the sick say, "I'm healed!"
    <br>Let the poor say, "I'm blessed!"
    <br>Let the weak say, "I'm strong!"
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
