  <p>    
    <br>I have a word of advice for the churches all over the world.
    <br>Healing, deliverance, prophecy and all of God's blessings are hindered by money.
    <br>It is not possible to heal people and collect money.
    <br>It is not possible because of corresponding power;
    <br>we cannot deliver and receive money.
    <br>That delivering gift is not for sale.
    <br>When it is time to heal, it is time to give what God has given us.
    <br>Today, you can see the church all over the world,
    <br>you can see that the age of healing, deliverance and prophecy seems to have passed.
    <br>It has not passed; Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>It is money -
    <br>those gifts are not for sale.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: NOT OUR WILL
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>God will send His people, the helpers who will support our nation, who will support us.
    <br>When we give freely, God will raise people, partners all over the world,
    <br>who will give and bless the ministry, bless you abundantly.
    <br>Let this come from the heart of the congregation.

    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>These are the challenges I have.
    <br>I find it difficult to begin to travel all over the world for revival because of this challenge of money.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Before, I was travelling from country to country but when I discovered the challenges of money -
    <br>money hindered the blessing, healing and deliverance.
    <br>Even if the richest man in the world is sick and you pray for him,
    <br>don't  collect anything; don't expect anything from him.
    <br>Let it come from his heart whatever he is giving
    <br>so that it will not look as if healing is for sale.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I stopped travelling from country to country for the past 5 years
    <br>when I saw the challenges.
    <br>I realised that the gift of God that was coming from me was not completely delivered.
    <br>I was asking what the cause was of not being able to deliver ninety percent of the gift.
    <br>The Lord said to me that money was the hindrance.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>In those six years when I was moving from one country to another,
    <br>when I stretched my hand, "This is the will of God to heal this man" - there was a hindrance.
    <br>I said, "God, what is this?"
    <br>"This person you are praying for, they have collected money from him.
    <br>Do you want to sell the gift?"
    <br>"No, Sir!"
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>I know we have many things we need to do with money.
    <br>A place for the revival needs to be hired - fine; that is good.
    <br>Lighting, everything, management - fine.
    <br>The sick people - people who are really in need of salvation, healing, a miracle, deliverance -
    <br>we should be very careful that before they receive those things,
    <br>there should be no exchange of money for healing. This should be given.
    <br>When you give people freely, people will surprise you.
    <br>They will give you what you are not expecting.
    <br>When you ask someone who is sick to give you something, he will give to you.
    <br>If you ask him before - 5 000; he may give you a billion when he is well, for thanksgiving.
    <br>That kind of thanksgiving is what God asks from us.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>When it is time for revival or crusade, it is time to hear the will of God.
    <br>If it is the will of God for revival, what to use, money to spend -
    <br>the Lord will provide it in a big way - not from the sick ones or people coming
    <br>but God will provide it in a wonderful way.
    <br>I asked God that before I begin to move for revival,
    <br>I want Him to raise my standard financially so that anywhere I go,
    <br>I want to support them with fifty percent of whatever they spend.
    <br>My partners all over the world and I are ready to do this.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>This will reduce the hindrance, trouble that is against the gift of God.
    <br>Fifty percent - My partners all over the world and I.
    <br>As God Almighty will not want me to stand here and begin to say, "Give me money",
    <br>so also my partners all over the world will not want me to say, "I need money".
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>Pastor’s Conference In South Korea
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Once again, my partners all over the world and I
    <br>- fifty percent of whatever you might have spent to make this pastors' conference wonderful and beautiful -
    <br>financially, we are ready to donate this.
    <br>So, from your own angle fifty percent and from us fifty percent. Thank you very much.

    <br>If there is any area the money came from that is against God's promises,
    <br>it is not too late to return it.
