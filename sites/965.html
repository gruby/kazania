    <br>Ask God to help you use your talent.
    <br>When God helps you to serve Him with all your talent, kings will discover you,
    <br>queens will discover you, royalty will discover you, nations will discover you, people will discover you.
    <br>Say, "Help me to serve You with all my talents".

    <br>Lord, make it happen!
    <br>There are many talented people but their talent seems to be dormant -
    <br>no one, no king, no queen, no people call for it.
    <br>Lord, make it happen!
    <br>Reveal their talents to the king and the people, in Jesus' name.

    <br>You say you don't have anything - you don't have a job, you don't have this - no!
    <br>You are gifted; the gifts are dormant - you need revelation.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation. 
    <br>Begin to meditate on the Word.
    <br>Without ceasing, begin to meditate on the Word.
    <br>Turn it over and over and over in your heart.
    <br>Meditation brings revelation.
    <br>Lord, make it happen!
    <br>When your talent is honoured and your gift is honoured, joy comes with the peace to serve God.
    <br>You are gifted. Where is the gift?
    <br>Every God's general in the Bible, their talent was revealed to the king and queen.
    <br>Lord, make it happen, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers, begin to remove satan's hand in your life.
    <br>You devil, I remove your hand in my life - your hand of failure, sickness, disease be removed!
    <br>Your hand of affliction, be removed.
    <br>You devil, I remove your hand - your hand of setback and limitation.
    <br>Be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command you, remove your hand!

    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Touch Your Screen By Faith In Jesus' Name
    <br>Viewers, wherever the affliction is located, I command them out of your life.
    <br>No hiding place for affliction.
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot remove - be removed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That affliction - out!
    <br>Begin to command affliction, sickness, disease wherever it is located,
    <br>in your kidneys, liver, blood, command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Begin to command them out!
    <br>Dry bones shall rise again!
    <br>Are you on the sickbed?
    <br>Whatever name you call it, never a sickness Jesus cannot cure; never an affliction Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Command, in the name of Jesus Christ!
