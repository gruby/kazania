  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, at God's time healing happens,
    <br>deliverance happens and salvation takes place.
    <br>It is God's time for your miracle.
    <br>Allow God's Word to live in you, get into your blood and grow to gain supremacy over you
    <br>as you prepare your hearts to join Prophet T.B Joshua in prayer
    <br>to bring about the kind of conversion that comes from the Living Word
    <br>and receive the breakthrough that will make you to forget the pain of the past, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Pray Along With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>Viewers all over the world, hear the voice of God.
    <br>You are delivered, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Receive your deliverance!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>The right hand of God is power!
    <br>Be delivered!
    <br>I can see you being delivered!
    <br>Be blessed!
    <br>I can see you being blessed!
    <br>Be healed!
    <br>I can see you being healed!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
