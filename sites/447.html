  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I want to quickly remind you of the message we left behind last Sunday.
    <br>The Book of John 16:33.
    <br>"I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me."
    <br>Take note of the Word, "In me".
    <br>"Here on earth you will have many trials."
    <br>What do we understand by "trials"?
    <br>One trial could be temptation, affliction, sickness, disease, setback, limitation in progress;
    <br>it could be any foolish thing.
    <br>"Here on earth you will have many trials."
    <br>It could be isolation.
    <br>Some of you say, you are lonely, you are looking for a future partner...
    <br>It could be barrenness - trial is trial, any foolish thing.
    <br>"Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows.
    <br>But take heart, because I have overcome the world."
    <br>He is saying, "Even though the world is a 'danger place', in Me,
    <br>'I will keep you safe.'
    <br>'Even though the world is a danger zone, in Me, I will keep you safe.' "
    <br>I am not trying to give other meaning to what is in the Bible.
    <br>After examining the message in the light of the God's Word - this is what the Bible says.
    <br>When you read the Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It is not history, it is given by inspiration.
    <br>It says,
    <br>'Even though the world is a "danger place", in Me, I will keep you safe.'
    <br>What does that mean to you?
    <br>Jesus is closer to you than you, yourself.
    <br>You have two personalities, two natures.
    <br>As you are sitting, you are two personalities.
    <br>You may not know; you think you are the only person sitting down - no, you are two.
    <br>If I'm not "two", how can this rustic boy be talking to you, and you would believe?
    <br>Does this appearance look like "general overseer"?
    <br>No no no.
    <br>This appearance is too small - it cannot be a "general overseer".
    <br>There is another T.B. Joshua you cannot see.
    <br>Keeping SAFE In The DANGER ZONE - TB Joshua
    <br>It is that T.B. Joshua you cannot see with your sight.
    <br>You -
    <br>Jesus is closer to you than you, yourself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "He is closer to you than you, yourself."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He is a Friend who is closer than a brother.
    <br>Can you imagine a friend that is closer than a brother?
    <br>He is a Friend who is closer than a brother - that is Jesus.
    <br>There's a wonderful name Jesus
    <br>There is no other name I know
    <br>Can't you look at that, "There is no other name you know".
    <br>They say, "A name to which all knees and tongues shall bow".
    <br>The challenges we have today: you feel you are with Jesus...
    <br>You cannot be like me without me.
    <br>Is it possible for you to be like me without me?
    <br>There are many people like Jesus without Jesus.
    <br>I like that.
    <br>They will speak, "Jesus is Lord"...
    <br>They know the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, they can teach, preach...
    <br>They can defend Jesus, they can say, "Jesus is Lord".
    <br>You cannot be like me without me.
    <br>There are many of us saying we are born again - without Jesus,
    <br>we are Christians without Jesus.
    <br>Pastors without Jesus, prophets without Jesus, bishops without Jesus, apostle without Jesus.
    <br>You cannot be like me without me.
    <br>This is why when you are calling His name at a point of trouble,
    <br>you cannot bring Him on the scene.
    <br>When trouble comes, you say, "Jesus!" - where is Jesus?
    <br>You find it difficult to bring Jesus on the scene.
    <br>Because you can call His name, preach, teach, pray, you go to church regularly
    <br>does not mean He is with you.
    <br>This is what He is saying,
    <br>"In Me, I will keep you safe".
    <br>"Though the world is a 'danger place', in Me, I will keep you safe."
    <br>That you bear any name: Joshua, Christian, Christopher, Samuel, that name,
    <br>you have been baptized many times - it does not mean you are with Him.
    <br>Many try to be like Jesus without Jesus.
    <br>Many claim to be like Jesus without Jesus.
    <br>Are you without Jesus?
    <br>There are many fears - fear of failure, sickness, disease,
    <br>fear of false accusation, rejection.
    <br>Fear, fear, fear...
    <br>If you are without Jesus, you will always be conscious of fear,
    <br>conscious of problems.
    <br>Instead of being conscious of Jesus, you will be conscious of your problem.
    <br>People are conscious of problems today but not Jesus.
    <br>You are afraid of problems, you are always conscious of your problems.
    <br>If you are conscious of your problem in the same way as you are conscious of God,
    <br>you are with Him; you are not conscious of God any longer.
    <br>People are no longer conscious of God but conscious of their situation.
    <br>He says, "In Me, I will keep you safe".
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Luke 4:3.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"Then the devil said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, tell this stone
    <br>to become a loaf of bread.'
    <br>But Jesus told him, 'No! The Scriptures say, 'People do not live by bread alone'.' "
    <br>He replied, "It is written that man shall not live by bread alone".
    <br>He said to the devil, 'It is written that man shall not live by bread alone
    <br>but by every Word of God'.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>Every Word of God is Spirit and life.
    <br>When you receive and obey the Word of God, the power of God works in you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you begin to think more about what you read,
    <br>not "think" but "think more" which is meditation...
    <br>This is the reason for our faith bracelet; counting your faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is a Heavenly currency.
    <br>If you want to buy Heavenly things, you need faith.
    <br>The more faith you have, the more Heavenly resources you buy.
    <br>Healing, blessing, salvation, deliverance are Heavenly resources.
    <br>The more faith you have, the more Heavenly resources you purchase.
    <br>You have dollars, you go to the market, you purchase goods.
    <br>Faith: you purchase God's material.
    <br>This is what we need.
    <br>I told you that a Spirit creates material things.
    <br>What creates material things?
    <br>A Spirit. God is Spirit.
    <br>A Spirit creates material things.
    <br>This means that Spirit is greater than all your possessions.
    <br>He gave birth to all your possessions.
    <br>You cannot equate your material...
    <br>"Oh, I want to go to church but my business...
    <br>I need to see this man for an appointment concerning my business".
    <br>You can't compare your business with worship of God -
    <br>your relationship with God.
    <br>God is the only thing; He is not one of those things.
    <br>"I need to go to church but I have a meeting somewhere.
    <br>I just need to attend the meeting."
    <br>Because of the "meeting", you are comparing your going to church with "meeting".
    <br>You can't compare them!
    <br>A Spirit creates material things.
    <br>You are one of the material things - you are the greatest material God created.
    <br>A Spirit created you.
    <br>You are the greatest product of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>But today, you are no longer the greatest product -
    <br>if a tiger enters now, you would start running.
    <br>If you saw a tiger now, you would start running.
    <br>You are no longer the greatest product, because if there is a hurricane,
    <br>every plane would be grounded, you would go nowhere.
    <br>If a hurricane was to pass here, you would have to vacate here.
    <br>And the Bible says you are the greatest product of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>but the hurricane or whatever - they are materials.
