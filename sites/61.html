  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Jesus is saying: I see you; I know you.
    <br>I know your disposition,
    <br>I know your thoughts,
    <br>I know where you are.
    <br>Get ready, right now.
    <br>Every demonic attack,
    <br>every spirit that stands against you,
    <br>be broken, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Every spirit hindering your blessing,
    <br>every spirit hindering your finances,
    <br>every spirit hindering your business,
    <br>every spirit hindering your career,
    <br>every spirit hindering your marriage,
    <br>every spirit tormenting your life,
    <br>in the name of Jesus, be broken!
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Whatever sickness,
    <br>whatever situation,
    <br>whatever disease,
    <br>whatever bondage -
    <br>never a burden Jesus cannot bear,
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot heal,
    <br>never a problem Jesus cannot solve.
    <br>Be broken!
    <br>Be set free!
    <br>I can see you being set free.
    <br>I can see you being saved.
    <br>I can see you being healed.
    <br>I can see you being blessed.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>JESUS IS SAYING, "I SEE YOU, I KNOW YOU"
    <br>Prayer with T.B. Joshua
    <br>Viewers, listen once again.
    <br>These words are not mine.
    <br>I can see you being saved.
    <br>I can see you being blessed.
    <br>I can see you being healed.
    <br>I can see you being delivered.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be healed!
    <br>Be delivered!
    <br>Be blessed!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>JESUS IS SAYING, "I SEE YOU, I KNOW YOU"
    <br>Prayer with T.B. Joshua
