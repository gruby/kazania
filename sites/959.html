    <br>Everyone knows that wherever the Prophet goes, many miracles happen.
    <br>We expect the same thing to happen in our country; our expectation is very positive for his visit.
    <br>We know that wherever the Prophet is there are always miracles,
    <br>in Jesus' name; and we believe that the same thing will happen in our nation,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>We know that God does miracles through the prophet and we hope that our nation will,
    <br>like others, be changed - for the authorities, the sick and everything that belongs to our nation.

    <br>that will happen. The authorities will be changed; and the sick people.
    <br>It will be a change that will bless their nation. Thank you so much.
    <br>Pastor Jose Carlo Puertollano
    <br>Spain
    <br>I am the Pastor Jose Carlo Puertollano, and I am here from Spain.
    <br>We went to The SCOAN four years ago; we saw the glory of God
    <br>and we have a lot of expectations because we know where Prophet T.B. Joshua steps,
    <br>there is a change; the kingdom of God comes to the nation in healing, deliverance and prophecy.
    <br>We are very excited about what God is going to do in this nation which is why we flew so many kilometres
    <br>to share what God is about to do through Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>We know that thousands of people are going to be healed and delivered in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>We have great expectations. Four years ago we were in The SCOAN
    <br>and we came here from Spain, because we know wherever prophet T.B Joshua arrives
    <br>there is healing, there is deliverance, there is prophecy and there is great change
    <br>and great healing for that nation. So that is why we took all
    <br>those miles to be able to be here and spend this time and be part of this
    <br>with Prophet T.B Joshua.
