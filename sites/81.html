    81 - WHY THERE IS DISUNITY IN THE CHURCH TB Joshua Sermon
  </h3>
  <p>

    <br>Are You CHRISTIAN Or RELIGIOUS??? | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>We, Christians, depend on God’s Spirit for strength and assistance.
    <br>That makes us Christians, different from religious people.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let's quickly go to the Book of John 15:7.
    <br>“If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you,
    <br>you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.”
    <br>“If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you..." - what does it mean?
    <br>"You will ask what you desire and it shall be..."
    <br>Very sweet - I like that.
    <br>"If you abide in Me and My word abide in you..."
    <br>This means Christ and His Word are one.
    <br>If Christ and the Word are one, what does this mean to you?
    <br>It means, it is the Word dwelling in you
    <br>which is equivalent to Christ personally being in you.
    <br>Remember, we are talking about God's Spirit.
    <br>Christians depend upon God’s Spirit to worship,
    <br>which makes us different from religious people.
    <br>Christ and the Word are one.
    <br>This means it is the Word dwelling in you,
    <br>which is equivalent to Christ personally being in you.
    <br>This means, the mind is not renewed without acting.
    <br>The mind is renewed by studying the Word and by acting upon it.
    <br>You may study the Word for years;
    <br>if you do not act it, live it, you are not the doer.
    <br>The title: PRAYER FRUIT
    <br>In this text, the Book of John 15:7:
    <br>“If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you,
    <br>you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.”
    <br>The Word here is dwelling in us, producing prayer fruit.
    <br>I take it again.
    <br>The Word here is dwelling in us, producing prayer fruit.
    <br>It is prayer fruit; it is the Word bringing forth its own kind in the believer’s life.
    <br>Take note of this.
    <br>It is not only committing the Word to memory, which is valuable
    <br>but it is letting the Word become an integral part of your being
    <br>because it lives in us.
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of Ephesians 3:17.
    <br>“that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith…”
    <br>Christ may dwell in your heart through faith.
    <br>What does that mean?
    <br>Christ dwells in our heart through faith.
    <br>Faith is of man’s spirit, not man’s mind.
    <br>Christ dwells in our heart through faith.
    <br>The Word builds Christ’s nature.
    <br>Raise your Bible up.
    <br>This builds Christ's nature.
    <br>God is building Himself into us, making Himself a part of us
    <br>by dominating, ruling and sanctifying our spirit nature.
    <br>Let me see your hand once again.
    <br>The Word builds Christ’s nature.
    <br>You cannot build one up spiritually on philosophies
    <br>or theory of the Word
    <br>or on the history of the Word.
    <br>We are made spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.
    <br>Reading the Bible, "Jesus is Lord... Amen amen..."
    <br>Are you depending on God’s Spirit to teach people?
    <br>If you are not depending on God’s Spirit to teach people,
    <br>you are only teaching them history.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You are teaching people history
    <br>when you are not depending on God’s Spirit to teach.
    <br>It becomes history without God’s Spirit.
    <br>It becomes just mere history,
    <br>history about Elisha, Elijah, Moses, Jesus Christ, Joseph.
    <br>If you are not depending on God’s Spirit to teach people,
    <br>you are teaching them history.
    <br>Are You CHRISTIAN Or RELIGIOUS??? | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>The Word becomes a living thing in the lips of believers.
    <br>If you are not depending on God's Spirit to teach, preach this message as a pastor,
    <br>and you just pick it because you are educated, you can read a line, you are an orator,
    <br>because you have the speaking skill and you begin to say, "Jesus is the Lord. Amen!",
    <br>you are teaching them history, literature.
    <br>God’s Word is Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>God’s Word is Spirit.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>God’s Word is Spirit,
    <br>creates material things.
    <br>This is to tell you that the Spirit is greater than material.
    <br>Are You CHRISTIAN Or RELIGIOUS??? | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>We are talking about how to depend upon God’s Spirit.
    <br>As Christians, we depend on God’s Spirit to worship;
    <br>that makes us Christians.
    <br>If you are not depending on God’s Spirit to teach, to preach, to worship
    <br>to sing, to dance, to fast, you are a religious man.
    <br>‘Religious man’ means, you have a line of action.
    <br>Right before you were born, it has been like that - conventional.
    <br>Time to leave the church, time to enter church...
    <br>If there is any reason to spend more than that, it means there is a special issue to address.
    <br>Your children yet unborn will still see that book on the table; it is written not as it should be by divine way.
    <br>And when you want to sing, pray, you have prayers you offer - it is written just like that.
    <br>And children yet unborn will also follow that line.
    <br>We call it 'religious acts' - all are in the book.
    <br>This has crawled into our Christian life today - that brings about 40 days, 40 nights - it is religious.
    <br>Jesus was led to the mountain, led to do fasting - you must also be led to fast.
    <br>But today the whole thing has crawled in - both religion and Christianity - we don't know the difference.
    <br>People are confused.
    <br>If you say 40 days, 40 nights, it's ok - why can't you also walk on the sea like Jesus did?
    <br>We select the one we can achieve easily and make it a religion.
    <br>Are You CHRISTIAN Or RELIGIOUS??? | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>If we depend on God’s Spirit to worship, there is no controversy.
    <br>If I depend on God’s Spirit to worship God,
    <br>I will not stand here and begin to condemn other people
    <br>because God has given me a map I should follow.
    <br>I will not now begin to say that man is not good - hatred and jealousy because we are all religious.
    <br>When you depend on God's Spirit to worship, you will not stand and begin to condemn other people.
    <br>You will mind your business.
    <br>If you cannot help that man, leave the man.
    <br>If you can help him, help him, deliver him.
    <br>Are You CHRISTIAN Or RELIGIOUS??? | TB Joshua Sermon
    <br>If I cannot deliver you, and I cannot help you, I will face my business.
    <br>If I can deliver him, I will find time, enter his ministry, sit down;
    <br>while he is talking, I can deliver him just like that -
    <br>the Word of God goes farther than anyone.
    <br>Disunity in the church today is as a result of religious acts.
    <br>What is the cause of disunity?
    <br>Religious acts.
    <br>We are not depending on God's Spirit to worship God!
    <br>If you depend on God's Spirit to worship God, your own portion of assignment is huge!
    <br>You will not be jealous of another man there; you will be content - it is huge.
    <br>The one God has given to me is so huge - I cannot be jealous of any other person.
    <br>But when you are a religious man,
    <br>everything around you will influence, intimidate you.
    <br>When I say religious, they live by the senses.
    <br>They live by what they see.
    <br>When you begin to live by what you see, no matter the knowledge of Bible you have -
    <br>you are a religious man.
