  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I say you are blessed.
    <br>The message: ONLY BELIEVE.
    <br>Tell your neighbour
    <br>ONLY BELIEVE
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>ONLY BELIEVE
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>ONLY BELIEVE
    <br>The Book of Mark 5:1,
    <br>"Then they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of Gadarenes.
    <br>And when he had come out of the boat, immediately there met Him
    <br>out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit
    <br>who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains..."
    <br>Physical combat. Listen to that.
    <br>"...because he had often been bound with shackles and chains.
    <br>And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces;
    <br>neither could anyone tame him."
    <br>Can you see how wild the crazy man was?
    <br>"And always, night and day, he was in the mountains ,
    <br>crying out and cutting himself with stones.
    <br>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken,
    <br>He said to the ruler of the synagogue, 'Do not be afraid; only believe'."
    <br>I have no other refuge than this command of Jesus, 'Only Believe'.
    <br>I am talking of behalf of myself and my household.
    <br>I know you are one of them.
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>I have no other refuge than this command of Jesus, 'Only Believe'.
    <br>If you are asking me, "How do you believe? Whom are we believing?"
    <br>If I believe you, it`s different from believing God.
    <br>You are here and God is a Spirit.
    <br>Can you see what we are talking about?
    <br>Here you are, and God is a Spirit.
    <br>If God is a Spirit, you must believe Him by the Spirit's power.
    <br>You can only believe Him by the Spirit's power.
    <br>By what? - By the Spirit's power.
    <br>Not just, "I believe you, brother".
    <br>It's different from believing in God because God is Spirit.
    <br>We must depend upon God's Spirit for our assistance and strength.
    <br>We must depend upon God's Spirit for our relationship with Him.
    <br>If I want to have a relationship with you, I will have it with you. I know you, I talk to you.
    <br>But to God, I must depend on God's Spirit for my relationship with Him
    <br>because God is Spirit.
    <br>How can we worship Him in Spirit and truth?
    <br>We worship God In Spirit and truth when all our purpose and passion of our heart
    <br>and when all our acts of worship - dancing, singing, praying -
    <br>are regulated and guided by the Word of God.
    <br>The question again: How do we worship God in Spirit and truth?
    <br>We worship God in Spirit when all our purpose and passion of our heart
    <br>and when all our act of worship - you know what I mean by act of worship -
    <br>singing, fasting, or meditating, "In Jesus' name"...
    <br>When all our purpose and passion of our heart,
    <br>when all our acts of worship - dancing, singing, praying, fasting, meditating -
    <br>are guided and regulated by the Word of God.
    <br>That is how we know we are under the influence of the Holy Ghost.
    <br>He does nothing without His Word.
    <br>He does nothing without what? - His Word.
    <br>We should be awake to the fact that we must believe.
    <br>If you can, all things are possible.
    <br>If you can, all things are what? - Possible.
    <br>Whenever we truly believe, our hearts will be at rest.
    <br>Remember, truly believe - I put truly.
    <br>Whenever we truly believe, our hearts will be at what? - At rest.
    <br>If our hearts are uneasy and restless, if we are afraid of this and that,
    <br>this shows that we have not yet believed.
    <br>When one believes, he is at rest.
    <br>When a person believes, he will no longer worry.
    <br>The kind of rest I am talking about is real, genuine and natural.
    <br>It is not a pretentious calm, unnatural self-restraint
    <br>or acting as if nothing has happened.
    <br>Let someone say, "Only Believe".
    <br>ONLY BELIEVE
    <br>I cant hear you.
    <br>ONLY BELIEVE
    <br>We must believe and rest unconditionally and absolutely upon the Word of God.
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>Take note: Faith does not rest in itself; God is the place where faith rests.
    <br>There is no faith in faith.
    <br>But faith in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>We do not need to force ourselves to believe that Jesus is Lord.
    <br>There is no need for us to struggle to believe.
    <br>This is the way with all kinds of faith.
    <br>Faith in faith, faith in this, faith in that.
    <br>If believers are not careful, they will be deceived.
    <br>If believers are not careful, they will be what?
    <br>They will be deceived because of their desperation.
    <br>Because of what? - Desperation.
    <br>When you are desperate, you don't mind where the solution comes from.
    <br>And you remember when satan was telling Jesus - he knew he was very, very hungry.
    <br>He took him up. He thought, Jesus was desperate.
    <br>He said, "If you can do this, you will be ok".
    <br>Jesus said, "Look, I am hungry but I am not desperate".
    <br>If believers are not careful, they will be deceived.
    <br>This is the way with all kinds of faith today.
    <br>When you are not living in the Spirit, you cannot live in the process of God's mind
    <br>and act according to His will.
    <br>But take note of this: We are to be sons of God with power.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[We are to be sons of God with power.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>[We are to be sons of God with power.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[We are to be sons of God with power.]
    <br>We are to be born again with power.
    <br>We are to be evangelists with power.
    <br>We are to be pastors with power.
    <br>We are to be Christians with power.
    <br>We are to be prophets with power.
    <br>I don't know what you can be with God without power.
    <br>Because the Bible says, To be saved is to have revelation of the glory of Christ Jesus.
    <br>To be what? - To be saved is to have revelation of the glory of Christ Jesus.
    <br>And what is the revelation? - The revelation of God: 'Only Believe.' Thank you.
    <br>Whisper it to your neighbour.
    <br>That is why someone can be in America, South, West, North, Asia country and be connected with us here.
    <br>Only Believe.
    <br>That is why one does not need to come here before getting healed.
    <br>By revelation.
    <br>To be saved is to have revelation of the glory of Christ.
    <br>And the revelation of God: 'Only Believe'.
    <br>The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act.
    <br>Do you see the way I grab it?
    <br>The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act.
    <br>But it can be very, very risky if you have not received the message of the gospel of Christ,
    <br>if you have not received the promise of the Father, the Holy Spirit.
    <br>if you have not believed by the Spirit power,
    <br>forcing yourself to do such is indeed a risk.
    <br>When God comes to ask for worshippers, the question will not be,
    <br>"Who worshipped at The Synagogue Church Of All Nations?"
    <br>"Who worshipped at Jerusalem?"
    <br>"Who worshipped at that church or this church?"
    <br>But "Who worshipped in Spirit and truth?"
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>When God comes to ask for worshippers, the question will not be,
    <br>"Who worshipped at Jerusalem,
    <br>at The Synagogue, at that church or this church?"
    <br>but "Who worshipped in Spirit and truth?"
    <br>Because God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>But today, we refer to the Spirit, "The Spirit of God says this, the Spirit of God says that.
    <br>In the letter, the Spirit of God says this, the Spirit of God says that".
    <br>To how many does the Spirit Of God actually talks to?
    <br>The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act.
    <br>Remember, 'Only Believe' - the revelation of God.
    <br>Rise up and talk to your heart.
    <br>Speak to your heart.
    <br>You have received so much and this message should not go without opening the door of your heart.
    <br>This message must open the door of my heart today.
    <br>Here I am, Lord, send me.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
