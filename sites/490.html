  <p>    
    <br>There is a brother there - tall; towards the end of this row.
    <br>Just raise up your hand.
    <br>Can I speak to you, sir?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>There is a charm you are carrying up and down.
    <br>Can you go and bring the charm?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>"How I Send Pigeons To KILL..."
    <br>NOTORIOUS WITCH-DOCTOR!!!
    <br>Outside one of the entrances to The SCOAN
    <br>"How I Send Pigeons To KILL..."
    <br>NOTORIOUS WITCH-DOCTOR!!!
    <br>You are a witch doctor.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>People consult you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>I am seeing this thing appear. A human being appears to you every night.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>They surround you and they want to kill you.
    <br>Yes, sir. They used to eat with me.
    <br>And at times my wife would ask, "What is that?" I would say nothing.
    <br>I used to prepare some charms for people.
    <br>If a customer comes to me and asks me for something,
    <br>I would ask them for the kind of charm. They would then explain themselves.
    <br>The items here have something I normally serve and I would serve it to them.
    <br>At the place, everything would be as required.
    <br>This charm needed blood from me but I said I did not have blood to give to him anymore.
    <br>I don't want to serve him anymore.
    <br>Listen to me and confirm my words. Not that you don't want to serve him anymore.
    <br>Human beings appeared to you and said they wanted to kill you.
    <br>If not that they came to you physically that they wanted to kill you, you would not come out.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>You know you used to shout in the night? You cry out?
    <br>Yes, sir. Sometimes, if I was in bed, the man would come
    <br>in a white Mercedes Benz, wearing dreadlocks.
    <br>He would wake me up and ask me to sit down, adding that he wanted to eat.
    <br>He said he needed blood, meaning he wanted to kill me.
    <br>He said he needed blood.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you address the people of God about the failure of this business.
    <br>The need to have Jesus as our Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Please viewers, I beg you all. This way is not a real way.
    <br>Follow Jesus Christ as the Ultimate.
    <br>You have now become a preacher.
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>I want to advise all men.
    <br>This is your wife?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Madam, can you tell me how he behaves at night when these people come.
    <br>Since I married my husband almost 17 years ago,
    <br>he would carry a little stick with a hole in it, he would place it on the floor to serve it
    <br>and name it Ogbu and serve it with the blood of a fowl killed for that purpose.
    <br>He would plead with the Ogbu to save all members of the family.
    <br>And that word always touched my heart because if I asked my husband to
    <br>surrender his life to Christ, I would not know his reaction.
    <br>So I always prayed every day.
    <br>Sometimes, when the children and I were asleep, I would hear his voice and would be shocked.
    <br>I would hear my husband's voice in the midnight...
    <br>Shouting.
    <br>He would shout and be discussing as if there was someone with him.
    <br>How many of them are always with you?
    <br>They can be 5 or 6, and they would surround me.
    <br>They are spiritual people, not real people, sir.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>I would wake up from my sleep around 2 or 3 am and ask my husband,
    <br>"Who were those people your were discussing with?"
    <br>At midnight.
    <br>He has different types of juju (charm).
    <br>In the house.
    <br>Yes. One is Ogbu. One is Iroko. There are different names.
    <br>So, I would ask my husband, "Who are you talking to?"
    <br>He would say it was the charms (juju).
    <br>They wanted to take his life because they needed blood.
    <br>I would then tell my husband that we should pray
    <br>and let's take this thing to church.
    <br>He would ask me that if he took these charms to church,
    <br>how would he make money to feed me and my children?
    <br>Can you see the problem you have been in for long?
    <br>You keep crying and praying that you have given your life to Jesus.
    <br>But your daily bread comes from charms.
    <br>Your children, yourself, everybody has been affected.
    <br>Now there was a marriage. A woman that came to you and demanded for a charm
    <br>because her husband married another wife.
    <br>She is light in complexion.
    <br>You gave her this charm, and the charm worked badly.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It affected the man.
    <br>You are right, sir.
    <br>I am just telling you one of the things he has done.
    <br>Just one of the thousands.
    <br>We have many questions to ask you.
    <br>We shall leave it till next Sunday.
    <br>I will receive you as my guests.
    <br>Your family, your children, you go and bring them for deliverance.
    <br>Your home too, we'll go there. Make sure we pack everything.
    <br>There is another charm in your house, in the form of a white calabash.
    <br>I was afraid to carry that one.
    <br>The real one that can draw the evil agents is the one in the white calabash.
    <br>Yes, sir, you are right.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Without prophetic gift and you confront this person, he will fight you back.
    <br>All what he put down is still a test.
    <br>If he realised that I could not probe the issue forward, he would fight back.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>The real issue is at home.
    <br>He prepared that charm for N400,000.
    <br>There is a pigeon that used to fly out and back.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Can you bring these things out.
    <br>The man is asked to bring out what is in the plastic bag.
    <br>Earlier, his wife confirmed that the husband has many charms, different ones and a shrine.
    <br>There is a particular one that he used to pray to and sacrifice to.
    <br>He would kill a fowl, pour blood on it and continue to pray.
    <br>The wife advised the husband several times to leave the charms, he would not listen.
    <br>Return them back to the bag.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Watch your screen, the man is packing back the charms.
    <br>Following the prophecy on Sunday concerning his life,
    <br>Mr Segun Maku was given Anointing Water by Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to go and bring the charm he had left at home.
    <br>Mr Maku, together with a member of The Emmanuel TV team,
    <br>boarded the bus outside The SCOAN.
    <br>They are on their way to get the charm that Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied about on Sunday.
    <br>"How I Send Pigeons To KILL..."
    <br>NOTORIOUS WITCH-DOCTOR!!!
    <br>They arrived outside the house of Mr Maku.
    <br>Disembarking, they enter the house where the charm is kept.
    <br>You are inside my room.
    <br>My name is Segun Maku.
    <br>This Anointing Water for salvation, healing and deliverance -
    <br>he said that I should go and spray it on the charm and then carry the charm.
    <br>The charm is inside my room there. I am afraid to go there.
    <br>Mr Maku leads the team into his bedroom.
    <br>The charm is inside the box there.
    <br>This charm is very powerful. It can kill somebody; it can even kill me.
    <br>I put the TV on top so that if somebody comes to my house.
    <br>they will not see anything, it's only the TV that they will see.
    <br>Mr Segun Maku brings out the bottle of the Anointing Water.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>in the Blood of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Mr Maku takes the television off the box,
    <br>again spraying the Anointing Water for salvation, healing and deliverance.
    <br>He cautiously opens the box.
    <br>The demon there is very powerful.
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>in the Blood of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Inside the box is the pigeon and the white pot,
    <br>containing the powerful charm the man of God prophesied about during the Sunday service.
    <br>"How I Send Pigeons To KILL..."
    <br>NOTORIOUS WITCH-DOCTOR!!!
    <br>In the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>in the Blood of Jesus Christ.
    <br>After spraying the Anointing Water once again, Mr Maku reaches out his hand
    <br>to take the pigeon and the white pot containing the powerful charm out of the box.
    <br>This is the pigeon the man of God was talking about.
    <br>And this is the white bowl the man of God was talking about.
    <br>This pigeon, if somebody sees it, they will think that it's an ordinary pigeon.
    <br>It's not a pigeon; it's a demon.
    <br>This soap - if somebody came to me that they want to harm a human being,
    <br>I have a special bucket here and a special sponge that I will bathe with.
    <br>This is the bucket, and this is the sponge.
    <br>I use it with that charm that will disfigure a human being's life.
    <br>I will tell the person to write the name of the person and
    <br>what he wants me to do to the person.
    <br>After writing it, I will use the soap to bathe.
    <br>After using it to bathe, the paper that he wrote his request on,
    <br>I will put it in the claws or the mouth of the pigeon and it will fly
    <br>and land on the roof of the person's house.
    <br>The next day, that evil will happen to the person.
    <br>The pigeon will come back to me; even if I am not around, it will wait for me.
    <br>If somebody sees the pigeon, they will think that it's an ordinary pigeon.
    <br>They won't know that it's a demon.
    <br>I can use it any way I want.
    <br>If it is blindness that he requests for the person,
    <br>he will write that he wants the person to be blind.
    <br>The reason I was able to carry the pigeon and the bowl like this
    <br>is because of the Anointing Water. It gave me the power to carry it.
    <br>If not for the Anointing Water, I wouldn't be able to go near it
    <br>because it usually appears to me physically like a human being.
    <br>It wants to take my life but I don't want to die.
    <br>My father taught me all these things.
    <br>That was the work my father was doing before he handed it over to me.
    <br>I have to bathe before I even touch the charm,
    <br>before I use it to perform anything.
    <br>This thing is very powerful.
    <br>I can even send this bird to London - it will go and come back.
    <br>I paid N400,000 to prepare this charm.
    <br>And now, the charm wants to kill me.
    <br>It used to appear to me face to face that it needs blood.
    <br>Sometimes, it will come with six members in a white vehicle, Mercedes Benz;
    <br>they will come and request that they need blood.
    <br>If not for the Anointing Water, I would not even be able to touch or hold it like this.
    <br>Mr Maku begins to pack the bucket and sponge that he used to use,
    <br>together with the charm to take them to The SCOAN.
    <br>This demon - it's over three years, since it's been on top of that table there.
    <br>Mr Segun Maku once again sprays the Anointing Water over the cardboard box
    <br>containing the charm and pigeon.
    <br>He then carrys it out of his house
    <br>and boards the vehicle waiting to take him to The SCOAN.
    <br>Mr Segun Maku arrives safely to The SCOAN
    <br>and makes his way inside the church walkway.
    <br>"How I Send Pigeons To KILL..."
    <br>NOTORIOUS WITCH-DOCTOR!!!
    <br>Here is the man, the wife and his children.
    <br>Man of God, the charms are outside there.
    <br>I went home and brought them.
    <br>Mr Segun Maku said that he kept the charms outside the church auditorium
    <br>and he moves to go and get them.
    <br>Going outside the church, we can see him at the back of a car
    <br>where he brings out the carrier bag and two cardboard boxes
    <br>which contain the charms and diabolic items of his witch doctor trait.
    <br>Mr Segun Maku carries the boxes and the carrier bag containing all his charms
    <br>back towards the church building so that he can finally be set free.
    <br>He enters into The SCOAN auditorium and asisted by his wife,
    <br>he walks back to his position by the altar
    <br>and places the items on the floor, before the altar.
    <br>Next, he spreads out a filthy cloth on the floor
    <br>before bringing each of the charms out of their containers.
    <br>Mr Maku brings out many dirty charms and objects including a grimy little padlock.
    <br>This is the pigeon and white pot the man of God had prophesied about last week Sunday.
    <br>This is the special bucket and sponge used in the ritual.
    <br>He brings out the wash bowl and sponge.
    <br>So anywhere we are, let us be quiet, as we are about to listen to him,
    <br>explain the harm he has done to people with these charms,
    <br>the chaos he has caused in the lives of people with these charms
    <br>that we are seeing with him, displayed on the floor there.
    <br>"How I Send Pigeons To KILL..."
    <br>NOTORIOUS WITCH-DOCTOR!!!
    <br>My name is Segu Maku. I worked in Benin as a transporter.
    <br>My father sent for me to come and meet him; he was a strong herbalist.
    <br>My father handed over all these charms and herbalist items to me,
    <br>saying that I should take over the work of a herbalist.
    <br>So, he gave everything to me.
    <br>I went to Edo State to start practising how to make charms.
    <br>People come to ask me to prepare charms for them.
    <br>When they come to me, I will tell them to write their opponent's name.
    <br>They will write the name and the residential address of the person.
    <br>I would first use this soap that I prepared by myself to bathe.
    <br>This is the white bowl the man of God prophesied about last Sunday service.
    <br>It's very powerful.
    <br>This is the white bowl the man of God prophesied about during last Sunday service
    <br>that Mr. Maku had left at home because he was afraid to touch it.
    <br>How do the soap and pigeon work together ?
    <br>Tell us the work.
    <br>I prepared the soap; if I want to use the soap with the pigeon,
    <br>I will use the soap to bathe with my special sponge and bucket.
    <br>This is the bucket.
    <br>After using it to bathe,
    <br>I would put the name that was given to me in the pigeon's claws or mouth.
    <br>I would then command the pigeon to do the job and come back.
    <br>At that moment, the pigeon will fly to the address that was put in its claws.
    <br>The pigeon would drop the paper on the roof of the person, then come back.
    <br>Before daybreak, the job would be done.
    <br>He mentioned earlier that the soap and pigeon work together.
    <br>He said that the first thing he would do is to bathe with the soap in the white bowl.
    <br>Then he will go to the pigeon to command it to go and destroy.
    <br>If any customer came to him, saying that he wanted to hurt someone,
    <br>Mr. Segu Maku would ask them to write the person's name, address
    <br>and what they wanted to happen to the person in question.
    <br>Then, he would put the paper in the pigeon's beak or claws
    <br>and command it to go and complete the task.
    <br>He added that the pigeon would immediately fly to the roof of the person's house
    <br>and drop the paper on their roof.
    <br>By morning, whatever the customer had requested would have happened.
    <br>Then the pigeon would fly back to him, to report its success,
    <br>speaking with a human voice, only he could hear.
    <br>What are the kinds of the jobs you normally send the pigeon to do ?
    <br>I used to send it to cause someone to have a stroke.
    <br>It can cause somebody to have a stroke, It does as I command.
    <br>I can send it to London or anywhere; it will return and give me the feedback.
    <br>I can cause someone to have a mental illness or whatever the customer requests.
    <br>Mr. Maku said that the pigeon could be used to make someone to have a mental disorder,
    <br>to cause a stroke, to maim or to do any evil thing that he wanted to happen.
    <br>All he had to do was to command the pigeon, and it would carry out his order.
    <br>Mr. Segu Maku then said, that the pigeon could go anywhere, to any country, all across the world.
    <br>If any woman wants a husband or wants to collect money from the man's hands,
    <br>firstly, I would tell the woman to get a bitter kola, swallow it and excrete it.
    <br>I would look for a special rope that we use for this job and take the bitter kola.
    <br>I would ask the woman for some of her pubic hair, finger nails,
    <br>her armpits and a native pot.
    <br>I would prepare the concoction. I would ask the woman
    <br>what she wants to happen to the person.
    <br>If she puts it in his food or soft drink and the man eats it or drinks it,
    <br>whatever she has asked for would be done for her.
    <br>It is a command and so it shall remain in the life of the person forever.
    <br>I can send the pigeon to any country - Nigeria or even London.
    <br>Have you sent the pigeon to London before?
    <br>I sent this pigeon to...
    <br>He has sent the pigeon to London before.
    <br>He sent it out to London.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The wife is confirming it now.
    <br>I have sent this pigeon to Italy.
    <br>One woman gave me the job that her husband disappointed her,
    <br>so, I sent the pigeon there to go and do the job.
    <br>He had sent the pigeon to London and Italy in the past.
    <br>There was one particular woman who said that a man had disappointed her,
    <br>and she wanted him to be destroyed.
    <br>Mr. Segu Maku sent the pigeon to Italy, and the man was indeed destroyed.
    <br>Whenever I send the pigeon to do a bad job, when it comes back,
    <br>it would talk to me physically. Nobody else would know what the pigeon is saying.
    <br>I can also send the pigeon to cause an accident.
    <br>What else again? There is no destruction the pigeon cannot do.
    <br>You have to accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.
    <br>I am ready to accept Jesus Christ today as my Saviour.
    <br>Do you have people that you have chained or tied down with this charm?
    <br>Many people, sir.
    <br>I have much work at hand that people have already paid me to do
    <br>but I will drop it now because I want to give my life to Christ.
    <br>The man of God asked Mr Maku if he had tied any one down by his charms and practices
    <br>to which he answered, "Yes, many are tied down till this moment"
    <br>and he has collected money from several people to do other jobs for them.
    <br>But he has abandoned all of them because he wants to give his life to Christ.
    <br>You have any question - anywhere?
    <br>The woman, please come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Florence Alumona.
    <br>I want to ask the man:
    <br>Does he kill people that have Jesus - a born-again Christian?
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The woman was asking you: What about a born-again Christian?
    <br>With the born-again Christians, it's quite different.
    <br>Some people go to church but also patronise herbalists.
    <br>But if it is a true Christian, the pigeon will come back
    <br>and say that it does not have the power to kill the born-again Christian.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is why we asking questions.
    <br>Those of you that go to church and still go to witch doctors -
    <br>if this pigeon catches you...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The belief of many is that the pigeon needs to be burnt.
    <br>If you burn the pigeon, the demon in it will go out but you only burn its flesh.
    <br>The answer is deliverance and let the pigeon continue to live.
    <br>He will be delivered and the wife also will be delivered.
    <br>You said there is a man that comes to you physically. With which vehicle?
    <br>A white Mercedes Benz and he appears wearing dreadlocks.
    <br>How does the man look like?
    <br>The man looks like a human being but he is a ghost.
    <br>He came to me and said that he needs my blood.
    <br>You cannot estimate the number of people you have destroyed.
    <br>I cannot count how many people
    <br>because anybody that paid, I would do the job.
    <br>I have been doing it for 10 years.
    <br>I will deliver you and I will deliver the pigeon at the same time.
    <br>I don't need to go and touch it.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The power of the Holy Spirit blew Mr Segu Maku off his feet.
    <br>Now under the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit, he is being disconnected
    <br>from every chain satan had used to connect him to himself.
    <br>They are receiving deliverance, in the name of Jesus Christ -
    <br>both Mr Maku and his pigeon.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord, they are free.
    <br>Glory be to God in the highest!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can see the pigeon.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The name Jesus brings light where there is darkness.
    <br>The name Jesus brings understanding where there is ignorance.
    <br>The name Jesus brings awareness of righteousness where there is sin.
    <br>The name Jesus brings joy where there is sadness.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Above all - contentment.
    <br>Give him the mic. Let him call the name of Jesus, see what will happen to him.
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>See what is happening to him.
    <br>By calling the name Jesus Christ, you can see him shaking, see what is happening to him right now.
    <br>Down he goes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is one of his children crying.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you agree with me that Jesus is greater than your need, let me see your hand.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This padlock - he would mention the name of people and lock it.
    <br>We are going to loosen the padlock now so that people can be free.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>1200 people's names.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I will personally open it myself.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thousands of people have just been unlocked from the bondage they have been in for years.
    <br>The man of God, revealed by the Spirit of God the evil that this witch doctor has done
    <br>with this padlock that we are seeing right there.
    <br>The man of God, by the Spirit of God, went there, collected the padlock
    <br>and unlocked more than 1200 people that had been locked.
    <br>Man of God, what you said about the padlock is true.
    <br>My husband used it to lock people's destinies - thousands of people.
    <br>A lot of people are getting free now but they don't know how the freedom came.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Come!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Who is a newcomer here? Come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the name of Jesus, just speak to her and see what will happen.
    <br>The man is a newcomer, he has been called out among the newcomers to go forward.
    <br>He will use the mighty power in the name of Jesus.
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>See what is happening. Down she goes.
    <br>That is the mightiness of God's power.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sir, I am very surprised.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>After Mr Maku's deliverance, he is presented with a cash gift of N300,000 and a Holy Bible
    <br>to further assist Mr Maku and his family as a platform to start a business
    <br>so that he won't go back to his former way of life to make ends meet.
    <br>My name is Segun Maku.
    <br>This woman is my wife. These are my sons and my daughters.
    <br>The moment I came to The SCOAN, I knew that God is existing here
    <br>to make my life change from worst to good.
    <br>I thank God for my life today.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>The power of the Holy Spirit blew Mr Segun Maku off his feet.
    <br>Now under the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit, he is being disconnected
    <br>from every chain satan had used to connect him to himself.
    <br>I was really delivered.
    <br>The monent I was delivered, something came out of my body.
    <br>That was the evil power of the charm.
    <br>Let him call the name Jesus, see what will happen to him.
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>See what is happening to him.
    <br>By calling the name Jesus Christ, you can see him shaking;
    <br>you can see what is happening to him right now.
    <br>Down he goes!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Jesus is very great. Now, I am a free man.
    <br>I don't see anything anymore.
    <br>If I sleep at night now, I sleep like a young man.
    <br>I am a free man; my body is very free.
    <br>Let him call the name Jesus, see what will happen to him.
    <br>Jesus!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>See what is happening to him.
    <br>By calling the name of Jesus Christ, you can see him shaking;
    <br>you can see what is happening to him right now.
    <br>Down he goes!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Now I have given my life to Christ, I want Christ to take control of my life.
    <br>After Mr Maku's deliverance, he is presented with a cash gift of N300,000 and a Holy Bible
    <br>to further assist Mr Maku and his family as a platform to start a business
    <br>so that he won't go back to his former way of life to make ends meet.
    <br>God is alive.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave me the sum of N300,000 and a Holy Bible.
    <br>The Bible is very great in my life now. I will be reading it all the time -
    <br>both in the morning when I wake up and in the evening when I go to sleep.
    <br>On Sunday, I will come to church.
    <br>I want to follow God in a true way.
    <br>To God be the glory, we thank God Almighty
    <br>that you have decided whole-heartedly to give your life to Jesus Christ,
    <br>having experienced that the Lord is the only way.
    <br>We thank God Almighty that today you are presented with the sum of N300,000.
    <br>And four bags of rice - I am very grateful because I did not expect this.
    <br>I only came here for deliverance, but this great gift -  I really value it.
    <br>When I go back home, I will use this food to feed my family
    <br>and this money to start a business.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for your life,
    <br>and we pray that the Lord will grant you the grace to maintain your deliverance.
    <br>Also live your life for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Let's hear from your wife, we believe she has one or two things to contribute
    <br>to the wonderful deliverance you received today.
    <br>Madam, we thank God Almighty for your life. Can you tell us your name.
    <br>My name is Caroline Maku.
    <br>I really thank God for the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to deliver my husband from the hands of satan.
    <br>I so much thank God.
    <br>Assuming he did not come here to submit all those things (charms),
    <br>I don't know the story I would be giving now.
    <br>I so much thank God. I know that God is here.
    <br>Before, my husband did not even know God.
    <br>I was surprised because we came here for deliverance.
    <br>Since then, the man of God has been taking care of me and my family.
    <br>He gave us money because he said that he does not want us
    <br>to live off money from the charm any more.
    <br>I was amazed because Prophet T.B. Joshua gave my husband N300,000.
    <br>He also gave my children scholarships and gave us a Holy Bible.
    <br>He also gave us four bags of rice.
    <br>In fact, I will tell the whole world that there is the Spirit of God in this church.
    <br>Thank you very much. We thank God Almighty for what He has done in your life,
    <br>and also in the life of your husband, bringing the family together
    <br>and also for taking the kingdom of darkness off you, to the glory of God.
    <br>I want to use this opportunity to inform you and your husband
    <br>that it is not enough to come to Jesus Christ for deliverance.
    <br>It is true that God Almighty is in all ages, gathering into Himself a generation of spiritual worshippers
    <br>but we of course also have a role to play.
    <br>The Bible says we should worship God in Spirit and in truth.
    <br>I will also pray that the new found love in Christ Jesus,
    <br>new found life in Christ Jesus which your husband has started experiencing will remain permanent
    <br>as he maintains a special relationship with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>We believe you have been inspired by the clip you have just watched.
