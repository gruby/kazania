  <p>    
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What a God we have to worship!
    <br>What a Son we have to praise!
    <br>What a future lies before us!
    <br>Greet your neighbour. Say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Greet the next person beside you. Say, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Viewers all over the world, Good Morning!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to see joyful faces.
    <br>Camera man, can you give us shots of joyful faces.
    <br>We want to see joyful faces.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Yes.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to believe that you have done your exercise this morning.
    <br>You have done your exercise this morning?
    <br>You know, exercise does not only mean when you go to the gym
    <br>and you are on your treadmill running or jogging.
    <br>Or maybe you are on your bike cycling.
    <br>You can also take a 10 to 30 minutes walk in a day.
    <br>And whilst you are walking, smile.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Make sure you smile".
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>I mean, when you take a 10 to 30 minutes walk a day,
    <br>always remember the prophetic word of our father in the Lord, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He said: "Oh Holy Spirit, take more of me, give me more of You".
    <br>I mean, whilst you are doing this 10 to 30 minutes walk,
    <br>let this be what you say in your heart.
    <br>Let this be a joyful heart.
    <br>That is what I mean by when you walk, make sure you smile.
    <br>If you have not done your exercise this morning,
    <br>you may probably find yourself restless or sleeping.
    <br>Sometimes, you can find yourself going to the toilet five to six times whilst the service is going on.
    <br>Why? - Because food and water are not rightfully positioned in your body.
    <br>So tell your neighbour once again with a smile,
    <br>"Have a joyful face".
    <br>With a smile in your heart, say to your neighbour,
    <br>"My neighbour, I know that my case is settled today".
    <br>Are you sure?
    <br>[Yes!]
    <br>Yes.
    <br>If indeed you know that your case is settled, then who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
    <br>[Nobody!]
    <br>If indeed you know that your case is settled in Heaven,
    <br>who then shall separate us from the love of Christ?
    <br>Shall persecution?
    <br>[No!]
    <br>Shall tribulation, affliction, poverty?
    <br>[No!]
    <br>Absolutely nothing!
    <br>Let someone say, "Absolutely nothing can separate us from the love of Christ!"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Brethren, when you look around the world today, you will agree with me
    <br>that our generation is facing uncommon challenges
    <br>and uncommon challenges demand uncommon faith to be saved.
    <br>When you look at what is happening around you,
    <br>when you look at what is happening around the world in general,
    <br>you will agree with me that our generation is facing uncommon challenges
    <br>and uncommon challenges demand uncommon faith to be saved.
    <br>It is important for us to know that in life, we do have days, weeks, months and years
    <br>that come with enormous challenges.
    <br>They are inevitable.
    <br>It is the time and season when God wants us to learn the important and crucial lessons of life;
    <br>as such, they are unchangeable events because they are predestined to prepare us,
    <br>to strengthen our desire for Christ.
    <br>When they come, how best do you handle them?
    <br>When they come, as Christians, how best do you handle those periods?
    <br>Majority of us are spiritually blind, spiritually dull - dull in understanding,
    <br>with the unseen realm absolutely closed to our spiritual vision.
    <br>We can only see the outward effects of satan's actions but we are blind to our spiritual course.
    <br>We can only see something happening but we don't know the cause.
    <br>God oftentimes uses foolish things to prepare us,
    <br>to strengthen our desire and determination for Him,
    <br>to stop us awhile and rearrange us for the future.
    <br>Whatever difficulties that you are facing,
    <br>whatever challenges that you may be passing through,
    <br>be assured that it is not your challenges that make you fall
    <br>but your response and your reaction to them.
    <br>It is not your challenges that make you fall or fail in life
    <br>but your response and your reaction to them.
    <br>While some of us yield to pressure and make wrong decisions,
    <br>others face the same challenges but make the right decisions.
    <br>Always remember that broken focus is the real reason why men fail today.
    <br>Whatever challenges that you are going through,
    <br>it is not your challenges that make you fall but your response and your reaction to them.
    <br>While some of us yield to pressure and make wrong decisions.
    <br>Others faced the same pressures, the same tests and trials but made the right decision.
    <br>Always remember that broken focus is the reason why people fail.
    <br>Regardless of your situation, choose today to let the One who created you assist you in all you do.
    <br>I don't know the situation you are going through but I know Jesus knows.
    <br>Whatever might be your challenges, brethren,
    <br>choose today to let the One who created you assist you.
    <br>Do not allow your bad experience to limit you.
    <br>Do not allow your bad experience to wipe you out.
    <br>Why don't you turn your scars into stars?
    <br>Why don't you turn your mess into a message?
    <br>Why don't you turn your tests into a testimony?
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No matter my situation, I will turn my scars into stars".
    <br>I will turn my scars into stars.
    <br>A Christian is known by his ability to face situations and circumstances.
    <br>I believe I'm talking to God's people.
    <br>I believe if you're not, before the end of this message, you will be one, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, a Christian is known by his ability to face situations and circumstances.
    <br>Those who see beyond their challenges, those who see beyond their situations,
    <br>do not despair in the face of their seeming setbacks.
    <br>But today we oftentimes run away from the very thing that brings strength into our lives.
    <br>Today we oftentimes dodge situations that bring strength into our lives.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Turn your scars into stars".
    <br>Let's quickly open our Bible to the Book of Romans and that will be our proof text.
    <br>The Book of Romans - let's take it from chapter 8.
    <br>The Book of Romans - after the Book of Acts.
    <br>Just before the Book of 1 Corinthians.
    <br>The Book of Romans, chapter 8.
    <br>Let's take our reading from verse 1.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>SCRIPTURE REFERENCE
    <br>Romans 8:1
    <br>"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,
    <br>who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."
    <br>Who do not walk according to what is seen but according to what is unseen.
    <br>Who do not walk according to senses but according to faith.
    <br>I take that verse 1 again.
    <br>"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,
    <br>who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit."
    <br>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death."
    <br>Let's go to verse 31.
    <br>"What then shall we say to these things?"
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>"If God is for us, who can be against us?
    <br>He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,
    <br>how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?
    <br>Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
    <br>Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen,
    <br>who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us."
    <br>Verse 35.
    <br>"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
    <br>Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
    <br>As it is written: 'For Your sake we are killed all day long.
    <br>We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.'
    <br>Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.
    <br>For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers,
    <br>nor things present nor things to come,
    <br>nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing,
    <br>shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
    <br>Let someone say, "Amen!"
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Turn your scars into stars".
    <br>No matter the situation you may be facing, turn them into stars.
    <br>Throughout history, the lives of the heroes of faith have proved
    <br>that we are created to live for God's design and not by default.
    <br>When you read your Bible from Genesis to Revelation, you will agree with me
    <br>that the lives of the heroes of faith have proved that we are to live
    <br>for God's design and not by default.
    <br>Remember there are two sides to a coin, just as there are two dimensions to life.
    <br>And as the saying goes, "No wounds, no pearls" -
    <br>there can be no promotion without a test.
    <br>I believe we all want promotion but you must be ready to go through some little challenges.
    <br>There can be no success without failure.
    <br>Brethren, there can be no promotion without a test.
    <br>There can be no strengths without weaknesses.
    <br>There can be no good health without sickness
    <br>and there can be no victory without war.
    <br>The war I am talking about is not a physical combat but a spiritual warfare
    <br>where only a God-focused, I mean a serious-minded person, will be victorious.
    <br>Only a God-focused, serious-minded person will be victorious.
    <br>If you believe you are going to walk on a red carpet to get there, you are wrong.
    <br>Brethren, if you believe you are going to walk on a red carpet -
    <br>nothing poking you, nothing distracting you - then you are wrong.
    <br>Those unpleasant situations that you are going through right now
    <br>are part of your journey to success.
    <br>Those foolish things are part of your journey to success.
    <br>Today, many have changed the course of their lives
    <br>through their inability to see beyond their immediate setbacks, their immediate stops.
    <br>Many marriages have collapsed,
    <br>many relationships today have collapsed
    <br>because of people's inability to see beyond their temporary setbacks, temporary challenges.
    <br>Many have changed businesses because they could not see beyond their setbacks.
    <br>Ask any successful businessperson, any successful couple,
    <br>they will tell you stories of their setbacks and comebacks.
    <br>Ask any successful person, any successful couple,
    <br>they will tell you stories of their setbacks and comebacks.
    <br>I want you to know that the beginner is not the owner but the finisher.
    <br>Finishers are those who always exercise great faith under great trials and persecution.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Finishers are those who always exercise great faith under great trials and persecution.
    <br>Whatever situation you may be facing, remember the Book of 1 Corinthians 10:13.
    <br>It says no temptation has seized us except what is common to man.
    <br>Sometimes, today when we are faced with situations
    <br>that look like temporary stops, temporary setbacks,
    <br>we easily make wrong steps, we easily make wrong judgements,
    <br>we easily make negative reactions,
    <br>we easily make negative choices
    <br>instead of examining our lives in the light of God's Word.
    <br>Sometimes we love to move faster than our shadow
    <br>and that is why most of the time we make mistakes;
    <br>we regret some of the decisions that we make in life.
    <br>Sometimes when we are faced with situations that look like temporary setbacks,
    <br>we easily overreact.
    <br>We easily behave negatively instead of examining our lives in the light of God's Word.
    <br>We want to move faster than our shadow
    <br>and that is why we oftentimes regret some of the decisions that we took.
    <br>As Christians, our challenges force us to look deep enough,
    <br>to explore possibilities, to draw closer to God,
    <br>to dream of other ways that we might have ignored when tests and trials come.
    <br>There is always a lesson to be learnt.
    <br>Many don't want to learn those lessons; we want to move ahead of our future,
    <br>ahead of our shadow.
    <br>That is why the Bible tells us in the Book of 1 Corinthians
    <br>that no temptation has seized us except what is common to man, for the Lord is faithful.
    <br>He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you can bear.
    <br>And when you are tempted, He will also provide a way out for us so that we can overcome.
    <br>Remember Jesus will not run the race for us,
    <br>but He promised to strengthen our minds against storms, thorns, snakes and scorpions
    <br>on our road to success.
    <br>You ask Peter in the Book of Luke 5 and he will tell you
    <br>that what we see as failure is not failure at all, from eternity's perspective,
    <br>from God's point of view.
    <br>What we see as rejection, what we see as setback
    <br>is not from eternity's perspective, from God's point of view.
    <br>We serve a God who oftentimes uses foolish things to confound the wise.
    <br>The unpleasant situation you are going through right now is so foolish.
    <br>God oftentimes uses foolish things to confound the wise.
    <br>Brethren, to the wise, disappointment is a foolish thing
    <br>but God oftentimes uses disappointment to preserve us for redemption.
    <br>Poverty, to the wise, is a foolish thing
    <br>but God oftentimes uses poverty to prevent us from death.
    <br>Rejection, to the wise, is a foolish thing
    <br>but God oftentimes uses rejection to prepare us for a new level in life.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My situation may look like a setback,
    <br>my situation may look like a stop,
    <br>it may look like a delay but it is not".
    <br>In any case, delay is not a denial.
    <br>Delay is not a denial.
    <br>When you are faced with a situation that looks like a setback, stay focused.
    <br>Maintain a balanced frame of mind,
    <br>dig deep and fight it through.
    <br>It takes faith to realise that our situation is a mere stopping interval,
    <br>a break between two events.
    <br>Therefore, when your situation gets hotter, you are getting closer to your breakthrough.
    <br>Let someone say, "I'm getting closer".
    <br>"I have no doubt I'm getting closer."
    <br>"I have no doubt I'm getting closer to my breakthrough, to my healing, to my deliverance,
    <br>to all of God's blessings in my life."
    <br>If you believe that, put your hands together for our Lord Jesus!
    <br>There is no doubt we are getting closer to our breakthrough.
    <br>We need experience to maintain greatness.
    <br>What is your situation?
    <br>Is it an inability to get a job in spite of your qualifications?
    <br>Is it lateness in marriage in spite of your prayers and fasting?
    <br>Is it hatred or rejection in spite of your hard work?
    <br>Is it health challenges that seem not to be yielding to your prayer?
    <br>Always remember that events that seem ordinary may have extraordinary effects in the spirit,
    <br>much of which is hidden from the ordinary mind.
    <br>Always remember when you face situations and you don't know what is happening,
    <br>always remember that events that seem ordinary may have extraordinary effects in the spirit,
    <br>much of which is hidden from the ordinary mind.
    <br>But it takes a reflective mind
    <br>to realise that behind our situation lies the promise of God for our lives.
    <br>It takes faith.
    <br>In the Book of Daniel 6 - we all know the story of Daniel -
    <br>when the decree was published, the Bible says that
    <br>Daniel knew that nothing beautiful, nothing giant and huge could be created
    <br>without a measure of toil, a measure of pain.
    <br>He knew if the human sympathy of King Darius had saved him from the sad part of his life
    <br>when he was sent to the lion's den,
    <br>the glorious part that followed would have been lost.
    <br>In the face of life's threat,
    <br>the Bible says that he maintained a balanced frame of mind
    <br>and he turned his scars into stars.
    <br>Brethren, if human sympathy could save you, you would have been saved a long time ago.
    <br>If human sympathy - money, wealth, position, popularity, fame - could save you,
    <br>you would have been saved a long time ago.
    <br>Sometimes when we are faced with situations, we begin to seek alternatives,
    <br>we begin to seek human sympathy to save us, to help us.
    <br>We begin to seek shortcuts, alternatives in an attempt to escape from reality.
    <br>It does not take long to realise
    <br>that shortcuts and alternatives have their own way of disappointing one.
    <br>If you cry to human beings for help, you will receive human sympathy
    <br>but that will not solve your problem.
    <br>It is only Jesus Christ, the Author and Finisher of our faith, that can solve it -
    <br>the One who has no beginning and He has no end.
    <br>Brethren, greatness begins with wounds.
    <br>When you accept your adversity,
    <br>the Bible says when we endure every pain, we will learn what we need to know
    <br>and our grief will turn to gain.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "No matter my situation, I know He will turn my scars into stars".
    <br>Finally, brethren, let the Book of 1 Corinthians 9:24-25 encourage you.
    <br>When you run, run in such a way as to obtain the prize.
    <br>All of us who are falling made a decision
    <br>but all of us who have not fallen faced similar temptations
    <br>but made a different decision.
    <br>At one point in our lives we all feel like giving up.
    <br>We all feel at one point in our lives when we are faced with situations, we all feel like giving up.
    <br>You might be asking yourself, "Why do I have to go through trials?"
    <br>"Why do I have to go through all this pain, shame, embarrassment,
    <br>rejection, name-calling, persecution, poverty?"
    <br>Yes.
    <br>It is because Somebody wants to turn turn your test into a testimony.
    <br>I tell you: Somebody wants to turn turn your test into a testimony.
    <br>It is because Somebody wants to turn your poverty into prosperity, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>It is because Somebody wants to turn your frustration, your failure into fruitfulness,
    <br>in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Who knows what would have become of you if those temporary setbacks,
    <br>if those temporary stops, had not come at intervals?
    <br>Who knows where we would be today?
    <br>But with deep reflection, you will know that there is a purpose of God behind your situations.
    <br>Brethren, this is encouragement to the timid soul like me.
    <br>Are you doing today what you ought to have done earlier in life?
    <br>Brethren, are you facing today what you ought to have done earlier in life?
    <br>With proper reflection, you will know that your case is not that of failure
    <br>but a refusal to do what you ought to have done earlier in life.
    <br>Never forget that patience, perseverance, endurance, humility pay off at last.
    <br>Perseverance, endurance, obedience, faithfulness pay off at last.
    <br>Do not allow your circumstances to rob you, to limit you.
    <br>Let the One who created you assist you today
    <br>and turn your scars into stars.
    <br>If you make the Word of God your rule and the grace of God your principle,
    <br>victory is yours, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Victory is yours, in the Blood of Jesus Christ!
    <br>May the Lord bless His Word in the midst of our heart, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Let someone say, "Thank You, Jesus,
    <br>for turning my scars into stars, no matter my situation.
    <br>Thank You for turning my scars into stars, in Jesus' name!"
