  <p>    
    <br>There is a woman there, a young woman, I don't want you to be shy.
    <br>It's like your parents forced you to marry a man.
    <br>After marrying the man, you had a child with the man.
    <br>You are dressed in a native attire.
    <br>What is happening now is that your eyes have opened.
    <br>You want to leave the marriage. Please come forward.
    <br>You are well-educated, very beautiful, every quality - you have it.
    <br>You realised that this man is nothing. Now, there is no affection.
    <br>You want to leave the marriage. You have a child.
    <br>Please come forward. You are there.
    <br>Your case is very pathetic.
    <br>I am calling you out because only Jesus can settle this.
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Watch your screen.
    <br>I am the person, sir.
    <br>I was forced to marry a man when I was 19 years old.
    <br>Now, I don't have any affection for him.
    <br>I don't even want to see him, now.
    <br>I want to leave the marriage.
    <br>I have a son for him who is two years old.
    <br>Why do you want to leave the marriage ?
    <br>I don't have affection for him. I don't love him.
    <br>At the beginning, how did you people get married ?
    <br>I was introduced to him by his sister.
    <br>I didn't know him before.
    <br>What of the child you have for the man?
    <br>I have a son for him - a boy, two years old.
    <br>What do you want to do?
    <br>Can't you see that son is very important to you?
    <br>He is important to me.
    <br>You look good by your appearance. What is the secret?
    <br>Do you mean that the man is not supporting you financially?
    <br>Or  that he's not the secret of your looking good ?
    <br>He is a good man. He is taking good care of me.
    <br>Anything  I ask for, he will give it to me.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>My daughter, my sister,
    <br>I want to see the man, I want to see your son and I want to see you.
    <br>We hold a meeting. You people go through deliverance.
    <br>Now, it is the will of God.
    <br>Thank You, my Lord. Thank You.
    <br>After the deliverance, you will have that affection you don't have for him.
    <br>Everything will be alright.
    <br>Thank You, Lord. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>This is a house that is about to be destroyed, separated, scattered.
    <br>The question now is: What is God saying?
    <br>Ok, let the husband and wife come out.
    <br>Watch your screen as they are now coming out.
    <br>I am just meeting my brother for the first time now.
    <br>My brother, we are here today to settle your home
    <br>and to make sure that there is peace in your house
    <br>and to hear God's opinion; what does God say about this issue?
    <br>What you have in mind does not matter but what God says.
    <br>So let's hear.
    <br>My name is Ufemia Eze.
    <br>Here with me is my husband, Bassey Eze
    <br>and my son, Victor Eze.
    <br>We are all from Enugu State (Nigeria).
    <br>I am here to confirm the prophecy to be perfectly true for my life.
    <br>That is the problem that brought me here to The SCOAN.
    <br>The man of God said that there was a young woman here.
    <br>It's like your parents forced you to marry a certain man
    <br>but now your eyes are open, you want to leave the marriage.
    <br>You have a son for him.
    <br>I am here to confirm the prophecy to be perfectly true
    <br>because I have prayed and fasted asking God
    <br>that I wanted to know His opinion about this marriage.
    <br>I want to know if this marriage is from God.
    <br>I want to hear from God, either for me to continue with this marriage or to divorce.
    <br>Last Sunday, God answered my prayer.
    <br>It is true I used to think about leaving this marriage
    <br>and the reasons are: He is much older than me,
    <br>he is 17 years older than me.
    <br>When I married him, I didn't know anything about love in marriage.
    <br>Now, I don't have love for him, I don't have affection for him.
    <br>Whenever I see him, I have hatred for him.
    <br>I don't want to see him at all.
    <br>There was a time I told him that I wanted to go and stay in the village
    <br>so that we would be seeing each other only once in a while
    <br>just because I don't want to see him.
    <br>Whenever I see him, I only have hatred for him.
    <br>There was a time we stayed five good months in the same room,
    <br>on the same bed without making love, because the affection was not there.
    <br>I see a stranger making love to me in the dream.
    <br>I see dead people in my dreams, I even fly in my dreams.
    <br>Are you ready to listen to the voice of God?
    <br>Yes, sir. That is why I am here.
    <br>Who is T.B. Joshua?
    <br>He is man of God.
    <br>Before I tell you the voice of God, I want you to be on your knees in front of this man.
    <br>You need deliverance.
    <br>You just need deliverance.
    <br>You have a spiritual husband.
    <br>This spiritual husband has married you.
    <br>After your deliverance you will know that this is a nice man.
    <br>This is the man you need to marry.
    <br>Those things you consider - you said he's 17 years older than you.
    <br>You are very lucky to have this man.
    <br>Coming to handsome and beauty.
    <br>This man will labour, go to work from morning till night and give you the whole money.
    <br>You use it to do crayon and pencil.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>Look at this handsome man, good looking man.
    <br>It is not your fault. Because he told you his age.
    <br>You just need deliverance.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Father, thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Give your husband a kiss.
    <br>Mouth to mouth.
    <br>HOW To RESTORE AFFECTION In MARRIAGE!!!
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>It's all about this spiritual husband.
    <br>You will start to see the affection now, right as I am talking now.
    <br>You will go to the mountain and thank God.
    <br>So, thank you.
    <br>I don't want to hear anything from my brother. I am meeting him for the first time.
    <br>He only sees the way his wife has been behaving, keeping distance,
    <br>she doesn't want a touch or anything.
    <br>But he is hearing this for the first time that she wants to leave the marriage.
    <br>I need to meet him. And that is the end.
    <br>The issue is not outward beauty, we are talking of the inner one.
    <br>The brother is very, very handsome on the inside,
    <br>while this lady is beautiful on the outside.
    <br>The reason why woman and man come together...
    <br>Where the husband is weak, the wife is strong. Where the wife is weak, the husband is strong.
    <br>They can help themselves.
    <br>Thank you.
