    <br>THE WORLD OF TRUTH!!! | Racine Sermon (SCOAN)
    <br>Greet your neighbour.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, welcome to His presence."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, how are you today?"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>you have reason to smile because Jesus is in our midst today."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>I say to you once again, "Good Morning!"
    <br>Shall I say, "Happy New Year", in advance?
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Yes, a new year is coming.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, what is the state of your heart?"
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, what is your assessment of this year, 2019?"
    <br>For some people this year, 2019, is a year never to be remembered
    <br>but for others it is a year to be marked with a milestone.
    <br>But by divine revelation truth this year, 2019, was marked as a fearful year;
    <br>so fearful but by His grace you are here in His presence.
    <br>By His grace you are walking freely, talking freely - covered by His grace.
    <br>God Almighty never promised to keep us away from trouble but He promised to see us through.
    <br>All we need is to ask God Almighty to open the eyes of our understanding
    <br>concerning the truth in our lives -
    <br>the truth in your home, in your marriage, in your business, in your career.
    <br>Jesus says you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.
    <br>As truth was older than falsehood, older than terror, it will survive it.
    <br>Truth got the start - that is the foundation.
    <br>It will get the race.
    <br>Let someone say, "Truth got the start; it will get the race."
    <br>Remember, Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life and Jesus always finishes what He begins.
    <br>This means the truth will prevail.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>don't judge your situation on the outside. Find out the truth from God's point of view."
    <br>Remember, faith comes when the Word of truth prevails over the thinking processes.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>faith comes, faith is settled in my heart
    <br>when the Word of truth prevails over my thinking processes."
    <br>This leads us to our message this morning:
    <br>THE WORLD OF TRUTH
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The world of truth."
    <br>Let me take you to the Book of John chapter 18;
    <br>let's read from verse 36.
    <br>The Book of John 18:36 - I read the very words of our Lord Jesus.
    <br>"Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world.
    <br>If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight,
    <br>so that I should not be delivered to the Jews;
    <br>but now My kingdom is not from here.'
    <br>Pilate therefore said to Him, 'Are You a king then?'
    <br>Jesus answered, 'You say rightly that I am a king.
    <br>For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world,
    <br>that I should bear witness to the truth.
    <br>Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.' "
    <br>Brothers and sisters, this Scripture says there are two worlds:
    <br>We have the world of falsehood and we have the world of truth.
    <br>What do I mean by world of falsehood?
    <br>We all came from an unbelieving world with its tradition,
    <br>with its self-righteousness that boasts in itself.
    <br>The love of this world is oftentimes the cause of turning away from the truth
    <br>and from the ways of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Those who live in the world of falsehood fail to keep their resolutions.
    <br>That is why every year they keep looking for a new year, a new beginning.
    <br>They keep looking for a break.
    <br>Why are they looking for a break from the outgoing year?
    <br>They are looking for a clean break of a wasted year of suffering, poverty, disappointment.
    <br>Why?
    <br>They live in disappointment because they live in a world that manufactures joy,
    <br>a world that manufactures peace.
    <br>The joy of the world, the peace of the world, is a fading thing; so is the life itself that carries it.
    <br>Let someone say, "The joy of the world is a fading thing; so is the life itself that carries it."
    <br>They have their own way of disappointing one at a time of essential need -
    <br>at a time you need help and faithfulness and you find yourself alone.
    <br>But opposite is the world of the truth.
    <br>What is the world of the truth?
    <br>The Book of Deuteronomy 28:6 says
    <br>you will be blessed when you go out; you will be blessed when you come in.
    <br>This means God has promised to be with you.
    <br>He has promised to be with you when you go out and when you come in.
    <br>In other words, Jesus promises you He will be with you year in and year out.
    <br>Jesus will be with you in the outgoing year and incoming year
    <br>because Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>The blessings of the world of truth are permanent.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, it shall be permanent."
    <br>The blessings of the world of truth are permanent.
    <br>When Jesus blesses you, He blesses you effectually.
    <br>It is a continuous stretch of relationship.
    <br>I mean, those living in the world of truth, the incoming year is not a new year.
    <br>It is a continuation of fulfilment.
    <br>It is a continuous stretch of relationship, fellowship and blessings of God.
    <br>No break!
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, no break!"
    <br>Those living in the world of truth embrace God's kind of lifestyle of positive faith.
    <br>They leave their imprint in people's lives in a positive way.
    <br>They multiply and add to people's lives.
    <br>They are channels of love where there is hatred.
    <br>They are channels of shining light where there is darkness.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, let your light shine."
    <br>They are channels of faithfulness where there is unfaithfulness.
    <br>When we say there are two worlds, we are saying there are two points of view.
    <br>As to the truth, the truth is not something to be discussed intellectually.
    <br>Truth is something spiritual that needs to be discerned spiritually.
    <br>If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, truth needs to be discerned spiritually."
    <br>If it is not in Spirit, it is not in truth and so it is all nothing.
    <br>Truth is our protection against the adversary;
    <br>truth is our weapon, our protection, against the lies of the enemy.
    <br>That is why the Bible says we should make sure to enquire of the truth,
    <br>we should find out the truth and hold fast to that which is true.
    <br>It means we should examine everything in the light of God's Word -
    <br>whatever you hear, whatever you see needs to be examined in the light of God's Word.
    <br>I want you to ask your neighbour these questions, "Neighbour,
    <br>what are your expectations in the year to come?
    <br>What are your expectations for the incoming year?"
    <br>Are you looking for a leader?
    <br>Remember David and Jephthah in the Book of Judges 11.
    <br>They were all rejected by man but God called them into great offices.
    <br>Man's point of view oftentimes makes a mistaken judgement of character
    <br>but God only views the holy faith, the truth, love, fruit of the Spirit
    <br>embedded in man's heart above human discernment.
    <br>Are you looking for a partner in life?
    <br>Man can tell you what a man or a woman looks like.
    <br>He can tell you he or she is beautiful, tall, small - that is man's point of view.
    <br>If you ask any bachelor here or any spinster
    <br>what he or she likes in a man or a woman in their life,
    <br>don't be surprised - they will likely point to those things that refer to the outward side,
    <br>physical aspects of sight - height, complexion, position -
    <br>but little or nothing will be mentioned about inner being, about inner character.
    <br>Are you looking for a man of God?
    <br>Remember, the Book of Revelation 19:10 says the testimony of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of prophecy.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy."
    <br>In this time, in this season, many will prophecy to you, many will cry out,
    <br>"Year of success! Year of fulfilment! Year of divine favour! Year of double blessings!"
    <br>All these words are smooth words without the corresponding power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>All these words just fill the air but do not ring man's conscience
    <br>without the corresponding power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>As an example, let's look at what happened in the Book of 2 Chronicles 18.
    <br>When you go home, take your time and read through it - 2 Chronicles 18.
    <br>The Scripture says the King of Israel, King Ahab, was on the brink of a disastrous war.
    <br>He summoned all his prophets - 400 men - to his palace and all 400 prophesied to him,
    <br>"Victory and success! Go - you will win! Go - you will have the victory!"
    <br>But the king called King Jehoshaphat of Judah.
    <br>The Scripture says that King Jehoshaphat was a man of truth.
    <br>He was part of the world of truth.
    <br>He was living a lifestyle of trusting in God in everything he did.
    <br>He had an independent mind, determined to find out the truth from Heaven.
    <br>So, he asked the king, "Is there still any prophet we can call to enquire from God?"
    <br>He knew the truth needs to be discerned spiritually.
    <br>King Ahab, who lived in the world of falsehood, said to him,
    <br>"Yes, there is still one man but I hate this man. He will never prophesy anything good to me.
    <br>He always prophesies evil."
    <br>Prophet Micaiah came into his presence.
    <br>The Bible says he was a true prophet, a genuine prophet who spoke the Word of God faithfully.
    <br>He spoke fearlessly the Word of God.
    <br>He prophesied the impending doom of the king,
    <br>that he would never return alive from the war and the king threw him into prison.
    <br>But the Scriptures reveal that the issue of the war went in the footprint of his prophecy -
    <br>the king never survived the war.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour,
    <br>there are two worlds: the world of truth and the world of falsehood."
    <br>We hear the Word of truth when God talks.
    <br>We hear the Word of truth when God speaks.
    <br>God gives life to His Word, confirms His Word and performs His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>I am here to tell you no Word of God is void of fulfilment.
    <br>No Word of Jesus Christ is void of fulfilment.
    <br>When Jesus says, "Yes", nobody can say, "No".
    <br>Are you ready to hear His Word today?
    <br>Are you ready to hear from Him today?
    <br>Remember, when we say, "Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever",
    <br>His Word means the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Satan - the devil, our adversary - rules the world of falsehood by using man's unrighteousness,
    <br>man's weaknesses, as instruments for his purpose.
    <br>What is his purpose?
    <br>To trap human beings to eternal ruin; to trap people to suffering, to poverty.
    <br>That is why the Bible says we should fight the good fight.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, fight the good fight of faith."
    <br>Are you ready to fight the good fight for your home, for your career,
    <br>for your children, for your life?
    <br>The Scripture says we should fight the good fight of faith by keeping the world -
    <br>its cares, its lures - from dwelling in our heart.
    <br>How?
    <br>By regularly taking the Word of God into our hearts.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, I say 'Good Morning'. Do you know what happens next?
    <br>Do you know what is about to happen next?"
    <br>Say, "Jesus knows."
    <br>Say, "God knows."
    <br>Do you know what will happen next year?
    <br>Jesus knows.
    <br>God knows.
    <br>Finally brethren, I will ask you this last question:
    <br>What kind of year are you expecting?
    <br>What kind of year are you waiting for?
    <br>We have two years: the year of falsehood and the year of truth.
    <br>The year of falsehood is a year of disappointment.
    <br>The year of truth is a year of fulfilment.
    <br>The year of truth is the year of God.
    <br>It is part of God's divine essence.
    <br>Only Jesus can usher you into the world of truth.
    <br>How?
    <br>The Scripture says faith in Christ Jesus enables us to embrace
    <br>what Jesus did for you and me on the Cross -
    <br>to restore the relationship, the fellowship, between God and man,
    <br>to restore the blessings of Abraham to your life,
    <br>to restore the blessings over your life - peace, joy that last forever.
    <br>Are you ready to receive Him?
    <br>We make the year new by the way we live it.
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, we make the year new by the way we live it."
    <br>That new year, that year of the truth, is not in terms of unfaithfulness, corruption
    <br>but in terms of steadfastness, humility, love, righteousness.
    <br>When you receive Jesus genuinely, the Scripture says
    <br>you become part of the world of truth, morality and peace.
    <br>When you receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour now, the Bible says your past is over.
    <br>Say, "My past is over."
    <br>Your past is over because you are sanctified by the truth of Christ,
    <br>you are purified by the Word and you live in the world of peace.
    <br>This message is encouraging and challenging you to seek the Kingdom of God
    <br>and His righteousness and every other thing shall be given to you.
    <br>And next year you will fear nothing.
    <br>In the midst of trouble you will fear nothing because the Lord is with you.
    <br>Say, "Emmanuel!
    <br>God is with me."
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, if God is with you, who can be against you?"
    <br>If God is with a nation, who can be against that nation?
    <br>Can you stand up, lift up your voice and give thanks to Jesus?
    <br>Give thank to Jesus.
    <br>Say, "He has come to usher me into the world of truth.
    <br>He has come to usher me into the year of the truth.
    <br>He has come to restore me, to bless me, to make me whole."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Give thanks to Him.
    <br>Why should I fear
    <br>When I have You
    <br>Surrounded by Your love
    <br>Your everlasting love
    <br>Why should I care what people say
    <br>They don't know what You mean to me
    <br>You are the reason I live
    <br>You are the One for me
    <br>Why should I fear
    <br>When I have You
    <br>Surrounded by Your love
    <br>Your everlasting love
    <br>Why should I care what people say
    <br>They don't know how You set me free
    <br>You are the reason I live
    <br>You are the One for me
    <br>Why should I fear
    <br>When I have You
    <br>Surrounded by Your love
    <br>Your everlasting love
    <br>Why should I care what people say
    <br>They don't know what You mean to me
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>You believe the words in the song?
    <br>Say, "Neighbour, fear not."
    <br>Have your seats.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>We have to give thanks to God.
    <br>The Bible says that prophets did not die out with the Old Testament;
    <br>prophets are the major theme in the Books of the New Testament.
    <br>Do you believe that?
    <br>The Word of God says they are the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>I have a message for you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I have a message from the man of God for you and for the whole world.
    <br>Are you ready to listen?
    <br>Prepare your heart, in Jesus' name.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, will not be in our midst physically
    <br>because he is at the Prayer Mountain.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take note of the word physically.
    <br>In body he will not be here but he is with us in Spirit.
    <br>I believe you know that.
    <br>We too were with him at the mountain.
    <br>We only returned for this service but he remained behind.
    <br>He is concerned about all that is about to happen in the new year ahead around the world.
    <br>Remember what God showed him on the same mountain at the beginning of this year -
    <br>what would happen.
    <br>Now he is back there to know what will happen next year.
    <br>Let us listen to what God showed him.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua spent the beginning of the year at the prayer mountain.
    <br>Let us listen to what he said about this year, 2019.
    <br>I am here to know the mind of God
    <br>concerning this fearful year, 2019 - very, very fearful.
    <br>I am here to know the mind of God concerning this fearful year
    <br>and also to pray for you and the world at large.
    <br>That is why I am here.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This has been played thousands of times on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>When it was playing in the beginning from January 4th, you were not taking it seriously.
    <br>Today you and I will agree that this year was so fearful.
    <br>He is still there right now.
    <br>Let us show you a clip of where he is on the mountain now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua On The Prayer Mountain 
    <br>Waiting For The Mind Of God
    <br>For The Coming Year 2020
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I hope you have seen it; that is where he is now until God releases him.
    <br>He is concerned about the year ahead and he wants to prepare you for the next year
    <br>so you too can prepare yourself.
    <br>You know a man of God by his antecedents because whatever he has told you comes to pass.
    <br>He is still there waiting for the mind of God concerning you, concerning your nation
    <br>and concerning the whole world.
    <br>That is why he will not be joining us in today's service.
    <br>We just arrived because of this service from the same mountain.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>God bless you.
