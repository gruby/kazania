    <br>regardless of my situation, it is well with my soul!"
    <br>Now, turn to your other neighbour and say, "Neighbour,

    <br>Now, face the viewers all over the world, say, "Viewers,
    <br>regardless of your challenges, it is well with your soul!"
    <br>If you believe that, put your hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah! You may have your seats in the presence of God and say, "Thank You, Jesus."
    <br>My name is Brother Chris and it is a wonderful privilege to be able to share
    <br>the life changing Word of God with you today.
    <br>If you look at what's happening around the world,
    <br>you would agree with me that we are living in a very negative world.
    <br>Would you agree with that?
    <br>I mean negativity abounds.
    <br>Every day, on a daily basis we are exposed to negative news, words, circumstances
    <br>and in the midst of all this negativity, everyone has negative thoughts crossing their mind.
    <br>You remember the beginning of this year, Prophet T.B. Joshua prothetically declared that
    <br>this is going to be be a very fearful year - 2019.
    <br>And truly we have been waking up to different negative news and the headlines.
    <br>We hear about terrorist attacks, plane crashes, terrible natural disasters;
    <br>negative news that can easily cause fear.
    <br>Every day, on a daily basis you find yourself exposed to negative words.
    <br>You can just be minding your business, walking along,
    <br>someone can just come and insult you, begin to make jokes at your expense.
    <br>You find people lying against you - what's going on?
    <br>A lot of negative words register in our hearts.
    <br>Negative circumstances...
    <br>Maybe perhaps it is sickness you are suddenly facing
    <br>or setback at the point of breakthrough.
    <br>You have been married for many years, looking for the fruit of the womb - you are barren.
    <br>What's happening?
    <br>Negative things are going on.
    <br>And in the midst of this, everyone has negative thoughts.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Everyone has negative thoughts;
    <br>it is inevitable."
    <br>There is no one in this world that does not have these negative thoughts crossing their mind.
    <br>The question is: What do you do with them when they come?
    <br>That they come, is certain but what do you do with them when they come?
    <br>Do you entertain negative thoughts?
    <br>Do you welcome them?
    <br>Is there space for them in your heart?
    <br>Negative thoughts come not necessarily because we've taken a wrong step
    <br>but because we're living in a complex and contradictory world.
    <br>And this mind is never free of thoughts.
    <br>The thoughts in our heart are the battle we will fight until the last day.
    <br>The battles on the outside are simply an extension of the battles on the inside.
    <br>So I ask you again:
    <br>What do you do when negative thoughts come?
    <br>Do you welcome them?
    <br>Do you entertain them?
    <br>Is there room for them in your heart?
    <br>And these probing questions will lead us to the title of today's message.
    <br>It is a practical message titled:
    <br>HOW TO OVERCOME NEGATIVE THOUGHTS
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "How to overcome negative thoughts".
    <br>Turn with me in your Bibles to the Book of Matthew 9
    <br>and that will be the proof text for today's message.
    <br>I'm going to read from verse 1, but verse 4 is what we want to focus on.
    <br>Matthew 9:1:
    <br>"Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.
    <br>Some men brought to him a paralysed man, lying on a mat.
    <br>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, 'Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.'
    <br>At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, 'This fellow is blaspheming!'
    <br>Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, 'Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?
    <br>Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
    <br>But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.'
    <br>So he said to the paralysed man, 'Get up, take your mat and go home.'
    <br>Then the man got up and went home.
    <br>When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe;
    <br>and they praised God, who had given such authority to man."
    <br>Now I want to take you back to verse 4.
    <br>It says:
    <br>"Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, 'Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?' "
    <br>There are two very clear-cut lessons for us to learn here.
    <br>Number one: Jesus knows you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Jesus knows you."
    <br>He knows your thoughts.
    <br>He knows you better than you know yourself; you cannot deceive Jesus.
    <br>The second important lesson to learn from this text is this:
    <br>Jesus did not question them for having negative thoughts,
    <br>He questioned why they entertained those evil thoughts in their hearts.
    <br>Negative thoughts will come in this negative world but are you entertaining them?
    <br>What do I mean 'to entertain them'?
    <br>If you are entertaining someone; you don't entertain your enemy, you entertain your friends.
    <br>When you entertain someone, you accommodate them, you open doors for them to come in,
    <br>you provide for them.
    <br>You create space for them, you knowingly allow them in.
    <br>That's what it means to entertain.
    <br>Know this, people of God:
    <br>Satan has no access to your life apart from the doors you open to him.
    <br>I'm speaking to children of God
    <br>and I know that whatever negative spirit may have disturbed you,
    <br>so far as you are here in the arena of liberty and you are watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>deliverance has come today.
    <br>I'm not referring to someone who has not been delivered.
    <br>As a Christian we have received deliverance - I'm telling you the simple truth.
    <br>Satan has no access to your life apart from the doors you open to him.
    <br>What will satan do?
    <br>He will continue to knock - who is there?
    <br>Guilt.
    <br>He will continue to knock - who is there?
    <br>Pride.
    <br>He will continue to knock - who is there?
    <br>Inferiority.
    <br>He will continue to knock - who is there?
    <br>Lust.
    <br>Satan will continue to knock until you open.
    <br>As far as you are living, breathing, satan will keep knocking.
    <br>The question is: Do you open the door to allow him in?
    <br>Do you entertain those negative thoughts that satan pushes your way?
    <br>That's the question.
    <br>They will come, they must come but how do you respond when they come?
    <br>Each time we entertain negative thoughts in our hearts, we willingly submit ourselves to the devil.
    <br>The devil's aim is to break your relationship with God.
    <br>That's his purpose; he doesn't want you to run the straight race with God,
    <br>he doesn't want you to walk with the Lord.
    <br>Satan will use the slightest opportunity; he's very clever, very subtle in using the slightest opportunity
    <br>to introduce negative thoughts because he wants to access your soul and trap you to eternal ruin.
    <br>He will come,
    <br>little situations, negative circumstances arise -
    <br>satan is waiting there to introduce negative thoughts.
    <br>How will you respond?
    <br>How will you react?
    <br>The way you respond determines your future.
    <br>Are you with me, people of God?
    <br>Are you following me?
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>When you entertain negative thoughts, you are watering the seed of evil in your heart.
    <br>And if you water something, what's going to happen?
    <br>It will start to grow and produce fruit.
    <br>When you entertain those negative thoughts in your heart, before you know it,
    <br>it gives birth to negative words and actions.
    <br>This is how we find ourselves slipping into sin.
    <br>Sin is caused by negative thoughts - engineered by the devil - which we entertain in our hearts.
    <br>Try and be very practical about this.
    <br>You can examine your life in the light of God's Word and understand how truthful this is for you.
    <br>Just pick an ordinary scenario:
    <br>Perhaps in your workplace you make a mistake or a blunder
    <br>and someone makes a joke at your expense
    <br>and everyone in the office is laughing at you and they use negative words towards you.
    <br>Many of you may join them smiling on the outside while your heart is bleeding.
    <br>And at that moment satan will use the opportunity.
    <br>He knows the buttons to press to try and manipulate us.
    <br>Maybe he knows that you are someone who has a weakness with anger, you are easily provoked.
    <br>Satan will come with these negative thoughts,
    <br>"Are you going to allow this man to disgrace you?
    <br>Are you going to just sit down there and watch how they are making jokes about you?"
    <br>At that moment you have a choice.
    <br>Do you entertain these thoughts,
    <br>"Yes. I need to take revenge. How can I allow this to happen?",
    <br>or do you as a Christian say, "I leave it for God.",
    <br>quickly rebuke these negative thoughts and move on?
    <br>The moment you entertain these evil thoughts, the seed of anger has been planted in your heart.
    <br>Before you know it, it will begin to grow.
    <br>Next day you are planning how can you get back at this guy.
    <br>You hear some people talking about him, you go and join that conversation,
    <br>lie against that same person to try and set him up.
    <br>Your negative thoughts have produced negative words.
    <br>Maybe the boss calls you and says, "What's your opinion of this guy?"
    <br>You know the guy is very good, very sound but you lie and say,
    <br>"No, he did this, he did that."
    <br>At the end of the day some of has ended up causing our fellow work colleagues to be sacked
    <br>for something they have never done.
    <br>Our negative thoughts have led to negative actions
    <br>because we entertained them in our hearts.
    <br>Are you with me, people of God?
    <br>On the other hand, satan may look at you as someone that has a low self-esteem,
    <br>someone that oftentimes can easily get overwhelmed and depressed.
    <br>When people make jest of you or jokes about you in your work place,
    <br>satan will know the negative thoughts that hit, and the thought will just come,
    <br>"You see, you are not good enough. You can't do it. You are not intelligent enough."
    <br>What do you do at that moment?
    <br>Do you agree?
    <br>Do you entertain those thoughts?
    <br>Do you allow those thoughts into your heart, or do you rebuke them?
    <br>Many of us willingly submit ourselves to the devil,
    <br>"It is true, I'm not good enough.
    <br>Everyone has been telling me I can't do it. These people are more intelligent than me. I can't make it."
    <br>You slip into depression because you entertained evil thoughts in your heart.
    <br>Before you know it, it will give birth to words.
    <br>You are talking with someone.
    <br>They ask, " How it is going at work?" - "Oh, it's terrible. In fact I even want to quit the job.
    <br>They don't recognize me. I'm not good enough."
    <br>Before you know it, when you are about to meet a breakthrough, a promotion,
    <br>many of us had quit our jobs, left our work places.
    <br>Our boss calls us and says, "Can you do this?"
    <br>You say, "No, I can't do it."
    <br>And you can do it!
    <br>But because you believe the lies of the devil, you entertain evil thoughts in your heart,
    <br>they produce evil words, negative actions and derail you from your destiny.
    <br>Negative thoughts will come - don't entertain them.
    <br>Are you with me, people of God?
    <br>How can I try and illustrate this for the benefit of people?
    <br>Can I have one volunteer?
    <br>Any volunteer, if the Lord puts it in your heart.
    <br>OK, thank you very much, sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I want to demonstrate to you the danger of negative thoughts.
    <br>They will come, but what do you do when they come?
    <br>- My brother, what is this?
    <br>- It's a fruit.
    <br>This is a coconut; I'm going to give it to you.
    <br>I want to see a genuine reaction.
    <br>If I told you that this that you are holding in your hands is a bomb, what would you do?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you - let's put our hands together for him.
    <br>Why did you take that action?
    <br>I got scared.
    <br>He got scared.
    <br>If you held on to that bomb, what do you think would have happened to you?
    <br>If it had exploded in my hands, I would die.
    <br>Yes! It is dangerous. It is deadly.
    <br>The moment the awareness came that this, even though it looks like a coconut, fruit,
    <br>but this is a bomb - the moment the awareness came, you got rid of it!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Harbouring negative thoughts is like holding a bomb.
    <br>Don't wait for it to explode before you get rid of it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>They will come, they must come - this is the world we are living in.
    <br>The Bible says in this world there will be trouble, hurts, pain - it's part of life.
    <br>Negative thoughts will come but don't harbour them, don't keep them,
    <br>don't allow them to stay in your heart.
    <br>Let me pick up this bomb.
    <br>Let me show you what many of us do.
    <br>This is what many of us do.
    <br>I just want you to examine yourself.
    <br>Sir, I hope this can fit in your pocket - put this in your pocket.
    <br>What is in his pocket?
    <br>It's a coconut.
    <br>To him, yes, it's correct - he thinks it is a coconut.
    <br>Many of us - what we do is we keep poison in our pockets
    <br>and then when trouble comes, we look for imaginary enemies to blame.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>You are the one that allowed the negative thoughts, you kept it, you concealed it,
    <br>but when trouble comes, you being to look for scapegoats.
    <br>When trouble comes, you begin to point fingers.
    <br>When trouble comes, you begin to blame.
    <br>When trouble comes, you begin to say, "My family is this, that..."
    <br>But you are the one that has kept poison in your pockets
    <br>by harbouring, holding, keeping, entertaining, allowing these negative thoughts
    <br>to remain in your heart.
    <br>Why do we do this?
    <br>Because many of us no longer recognize evil as evil.
    <br>We don't see the world through God's eyes.
    <br>It looks just like an ordinary fruit to us.
    <br>We say, "There is no harm in this."
    <br>Negative thoughts come, you say, "There is nothing wrong."
    <br>You begin to brood on them, keep them, entertain them in your privacy.
    <br>You begin to think about them, plot and plan.
    <br>What you are doing is destroying yourself.
    <br>The problem is not around you, the problem is in your pocket.
    <br>My brother, you can keep the coconut.
    <br>Have your seat.
    <br>Keep it.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Right now, I want to tell you, people of God:
    <br>Enough is enough!
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Enough is enough!"
    <br>In fact I want you to rise up right now - we are going to make a declaration together.
    <br>Rise up to your feet.
    <br>Viewers, rise up wherever you are watching.
    <br>We want to make a declaration right now.
    <br>Enough is enough to entertaining evil in our hearts.
    <br>Right now say after me:
    <br>You devil!
    <br>I want you to say it with passion.
    <br>Say, "You devil, I refuse to submit to your deception!"
    <br>I refuse to listen to your lies!
    <br>I refuse to surrender to negative thoughts!
    <br>They will come but they will not stay because there is no space in my heart for evil!
    <br>There is no room in my apartment for evil!
    <br>There is no chance in my life for evil because sin's power over me is broken!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You listened to the anointed song:
    <br>Sin's power over you is broken!
    <br>You don't have to allow negative thoughts to control you!
    <br>You don't have to allow negative thoughts to take hold of you!
    <br>They will come; as they come - get rid of them.
    <br>As they come - reject them!
    <br>As they come - rebuke them!
    <br>I will not be overcome by evil; I will overcome evil with good.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may have your seats, people of God.
    <br>I want you to make that your confession.
    <br>A negative thought in itself is not deadly.
    <br>It becomes deadly when we harbour, hold and keep them.
    <br>Why?
    <br>When you harbour these negative thoughts, you hardly know that you are trapped.
    <br>That's the the worst kind of imprisonment,
    <br>when you are imprisoned without knowing you are trapped.
    <br>This is what satan wants to achieve; he wants to see you believe you are free
    <br>whereas you are imprisoned, trapped and you are the one that has locked your own chains
    <br>by allowing, permitting, entertaining, giving audience to the lies and deceptions of the devil.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So often today, because we don't look at the world through God's eyes,
    <br>our hearts have become so distracted, disconnected from the Word of God.
    <br>We no longer recognize evil as evil.
    <br>We no longer see what is sinful as what is sinful - we allow these things.
    <br>Because of this, we are blinded from reality.
    <br>Let me tell you some reality; when I say reality, I mean truth.
    <br>There is no reality outside of Christ.
    <br>When many of us are hurt, we behave as if we are the only ones that have ever been cheated.
    <br>We behave as if we are the only ones that have ever been wronged.
    <br>We behave as if we are the only ones that have ever been lied against.
    <br>That's the way we react.
    <br>Someone just wrongs you;
    <br>immediately satan will introduce those negative thoughts,
    <br>"How can this guy say this about me? How can God allow this to happen to me?"
    <br>You begin to agree with him, "Yes, it's true. Why me of all this? Why am I facing this?"
    <br>Listen people of God: Do you know the reality?
    <br>Everyone has been hurt.
    <br>As far as we are living in this world, it will happen
    <br>but we forget the reality because we are blinded from the truth.
    <br>You begin to react, "How can this happen to me? What is going on?"
    <br>Harbouring negative thoughts, allowing, entertaining negative thoughts
    <br>and all of this is diverting our destiny.
    <br>Because we behave as if we are the only ones that this has ever happened to.
    <br>It happens to everyone.
    <br>If you are cheated as a Christian, leave it for God; He will vindicate you.
    <br>You are wronged as a Christian - leave it for God; He will defend you.
    <br>You are lied against as a Christian - leave it for God; He is your Judge.
    <br>But today, one lie against us - we hold offence, we look at God in a bad light,
    <br>we begin to harbour negativity.
    <br>Before you know it, it gives birth in negative words, to negative actions.
    <br>Before you know it, you have gone astray from your walk with the Lord,
    <br>whereas it happens to everyone.
    <br>There is no one in this world without a situation.
    <br>Everyone has a situation - that's life; this is the reality.
    <br>You have come here today for prayer, for a particular trouble -
    <br>by the time God touches that trouble and removes it,
    <br>don't worry - another trouble will come your way.
    <br>That's life.
    <br>If we didn't have these troublesm perhaps we wouldn't have the zeal for God.
    <br>These things remind us, create a sense of dependence on God.
    <br>But today we behave as if we are the only ones that are in trouble.
    <br>We react as if no one else has passed through what we are passing through.
    <br>We respond as if we are the only ones God is dealing with unjustly, unfairly,
    <br>"Why is that happening to me? Why is this going on?"
    <br>This causes us to entertain and harbour negative thoughts in our hearts.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As I round up, I want you to tell you the simple truth.
    <br>If you are a Christian, the situation you're in that seems negative, will have a positive result.
    <br>Where then is there room for negative thoughts?
    <br>Your situation is not like others.
    <br>If you are a Christian and you are facing setback, your setback is a setup for breakthrough.
    <br>If you are a Christian and you are facing failure, your failure is to prepare you for success.
    <br>You are a Christian and you're in your dark moment, your troubling moment;
    <br>your dark moment will make you to value, see and appreciate the light
    <br>by the time it finally comes.
    <br>Perhaps you are sick today; by the time healing comes, God will help you to manage your good health.
    <br>You will know the value and appreciate your good health.
    <br>What am I saying, brethren?
    <br>Just as Joseph said to his brothers, in Genesis 50:20,
    <br>'You intended this for evil but God allowed it for good, so that His purpose will be accomplished.'
    <br>What you are facing today that seems negative
    <br>will be used by God to accomplish His purpose in your life.
    <br>What you are facing today that looks negative:
    <br>Is it barrenness? Trouble in your workplace? Marital issues?
    <br>Are you facing sickness that doesn't seem to respond to doctor's treatments?
    <br>Are you facing this, that?
    <br>As a Christian, what you are facing that looks negative, that seems negative
    <br>will be used by God to release you into your divine destiny.
    <br>Where then is there room for negative thoughts?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>... in what will end in a positive outcome.
    <br>Romans 8:28 says, 'All things work together for the good of those who love God.'
    <br>It does not say 'some things', 'success', 'breakthrough',
    <br>it says 'all things work together.'
    <br>So, what is the way out now?
    <br>When negative thoughts strike, run to God.
    <br>What satan intends to take you away from Him will actually end up moving you closer to Him
    <br>and you will overcome.
    <br>When negative thoughts come, don't entertain them.
    <br>The moment you recognise this is evil, this is wrong, this is negative, run to God, seek God.
    <br>As Romans 12:21 says,
    <br>"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
    <br>James 1:17 says,
    <br>"Every good and perfect gift is from above..."
    <br>When negative thoughts strike, let your heart rise and seek the things that are above
    <br>because sin's power over you is broken.
    <br>Let's sing that together.
    <br>Sin's power over me is broken
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>When Jesus went I went
    <br>When He went we went
    <br>Sin's power over us is broken
    <br>If sin's power over you is broken, you don't need to allow negative thoughts to control your heart.
    <br>What does the Bible say? It says, 'Take captive your thoughts in obedience to Christ.'
    <br>Once you capture your thoughts, you capture all.
    <br>Once you capture your thoughts, you win the battle.
    <br>Once you can control your heart, you can control your life.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So brethren, in conclusion:
    <br>In this negative world, negative thoughts will come; don't allow them to rule you.
    <br>The moment you recognise, realise that this thought is not from God, what do you do?
    <br>Quickly rebuke it, run to God and overcome.
    <br>It happens to everyone.
    <br>Even our Lord, Jesus Christ in the garden of Gethsemane - a negative thought came;
    <br>He said, "God, let this cup pass from Me."
    <br>Immediately the Holy Spirit prompted Him and He said, "Lord, not My will but Your will be done."
    <br>Everyone passed through this.
    <br>I pray God will bless this Word in the midst of your hearts
    <br>and that you will be a doer of the Word not just a hearer, in Jesus' name.
