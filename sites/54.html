  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world,
    <br>at God's time healing happens,
    <br>deliverance happens
    <br>and salvation takes place.
    <br>It is God's time for your miracle!
    <br>Allow God's Word to live in you,
    <br>to get into your blood
    <br>and grow to gain supremacy over you
    <br>as you prepare your hearts
    <br>to join Prophet T.B. Joshua in prayer
    <br>to bring about the kind of conversion
    <br>that comes from the Living Word
    <br>and receive the breakthrough
    <br>that will make you forget the pain of the past,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>REBUKE THE SPIRT OF SICKNESS!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Viewers Prayer
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>Every spirit troubling your life,

    <br>I rebuke them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be rebuked, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Spirit of sickness,
    <br>spirit of disease,
    <br>spirit of infirmity,
    <br>spirit of poverty,
    <br>spirit of hardship,
    <br>spirit of barrenness -
    <br>be rebuked!
    <br>I command them out! Out!
    <br>REBUKE THE SPIRT OF SICKNESS!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Viewers Prayer
    <br>Viewers all over the world, you are with me here and I am with you there
    <br>by the power of the Holy Ghost!
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>That affliction, evil spirits are behind it.
    <br>That affliction, infirmity, evil spirits are behind it.
    <br>That poverty, evil spirits are behind it.
    <br>That hardship, evil spirits are responsible.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Every spirit troubling your career,
    <br>every spirit troubling your health,
    <br>every spirit troubling your marriage,

    <br>I rebuke them, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I cast them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I command them out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Leave my people!
    <br>My God, can my people be sick people?
    <br>Can my people be poor people?
    <br>I say, leave my people!
    <br>You are my people!
    <br>Say to me, you are my people!
    <br>Say, I am your people!
    <br>You are my people!
    <br>We are people of God!
    <br>You evil spirit, leave my people!
    <br>Leave their lives!
    <br>Leave their business!
    <br>Leave their career!
    <br>Leave their marriage!
    <br>REBUKE THE SPIRT OF SICKNESS!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Viewers Prayer
    <br>This is the voice of God for you.
    <br>Viewers at home, make use of this prayer.
    <br>It is a prophetic word for you.
    <br>Oh Lord, as you defeated and disgraced the prophets of Baal,
    <br>every spirit, every Goliath, every demon,
    <br>every spirit, every situation facing my business,
    <br>every situation facing my career,
    <br>every situation facing my destiny,
    <br>every situation facing my marriage -
    <br>oh Lord, every spirit tormenting my life,
    <br>be disgraced and defeated,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
