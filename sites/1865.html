    <br>HOW GOD WANTS US TO MARK MY 57TH BIRTHDAY!!! | TB Joshua
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY
    <br>TB JOSHUA
    <br>Viewers, Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>Happy 57th Birthday! June 12th.
    <br>Birthdays are a time to reflect on the memories of yesterday, the joys of today and the dreams of tomorrow.
    <br>Viewers, I want to thank you for your prayers and your love.
    <br>Many waters cannot quench love.
    <br>Thank you for your prayer.
    <br>Viewers, what does this love I am talking about look like?
    <br>Love that has feet to move to the needy, to move to the sick ones, to move to the hungry ones.
    <br>Love that has hands to help others without expectation.
    <br>Love that has eyes to see misery and want.
    <br>Love that has ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men.
    <br>Viewers, thank you, my friends.
    <br>Happy Birthday!
    <br>The only way to have a friend is to be one.
    <br>Viewers, many T.B. Joshuas are orphans.
    <br>Let us father them!
    <br>Many T.B. Joshuas are homeless.
    <br>Let us shelter them!
    <br>Many T.B. Joshuas are sick.
    <br>Let us care for them!
    <br>Many T.B. Joshuas are lonely.
    <br>Let us be their companion.
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY
    <br>TB JOSHUA
    <br>Happy Birthday!
    <br>My friends, let the feelings of others matter to us:
    <br>"Will these children not go to school?"
    <br>"How can these people be lonely and homeless?"
    <br>There are many sick ones, hungry people, widows and orphans in our communities.
    <br>Let us care for them.
    <br>Viewers, my friends, Happy Birthday!
    <br>Let me leave you with these words of exhortation.
    <br>I will take you to the Book of Matthew 25:40.
    <br>"And the King will tell them, 'I assure you, when you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters,
    <br>you were doing it to me!' "
    <br>Viewers, what does this mean?
    <br>Whatsoever you do to the least one, that you do to God.
    <br>Happy Birthday!
    <br>Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers
    <br>That you do unto Me
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY
    <br>TB JOSHUA
    <br>Let us pray.
    <br>Viewers, by the authority of the Scripture,
    <br>I proclaim a mighty blessing upon your life!
    <br>I proclaim a mighty blessing upon your now!
    <br>I proclaim a mighty blessing upon your future!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Lord Jesus, as we celebrate according to Your instruction,
    <br>give us the vision we should have for our lives.
    <br>Give us the faith and the courage to dream big, in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Happy Birthday!
    <br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY
    <br>TB JOSHUA
