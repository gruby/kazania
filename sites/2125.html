  <p>    
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>In the arena of liberty, the key is not to suppress the flesh.
    <br>The key is to surrender to the Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: In the arena of liberty, the key is not to suppress the flesh.
    <br>The key is to surrender to the Spirit.
    <br>Open your heart.
    <br>Begin to confess whom you are in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Remember, Jesus confessed whom He was.
    <br>I'm justified.
    <br>I'm no longer condemned.
    <br>Defeat and failure are things of the past.
    <br>I'm linked up with God.
    <br>I'm born again.
    <br>Open your heart and begin to confess this.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Walking in the Spirit is so exciting.
    <br>Our proof text shall be taken from the book of Galatians 5: "Freedom in Christ".
    <br>Verse 1 - "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm ..."
    <br>Verse 6 - "... The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love."
    <br>Faith Works By Love - that will be the title of our message.
    <br>Let someone say: Faith Works By Love.
    <br>Faith - love, love - faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>The Bible says, faith works by love.
    <br>What does this mean?
    <br>This means, faith, where it is true, where it is genuine, where it is blue true,
    <br>where it is patriotic, is a working grace.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Faith, where it is true, where it is genuine,
    <br>where it is patriotic, where it is blue true, is a working grace.
    <br>It is a working grace.
    <br>Galatians 5:6 - "... The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love."
    <br>'Expressing itself through love' - that is, without faith working by love, all else is worthless.
    <br>In the book of Mark 11:25 - 26, Jesus clearly links faith to forgiveness.
    <br>Faith works by love.
    <br>Without faith working by love, all else is worthless.
    <br>In Galatians 5:6 - "... The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love."
    <br>This means, it works by love - love to God and love to our brethren.
    <br>Faith thus working by love is all in all in our Christianity.
    <br>'To know God's presence is to know God's power' - this means,
    <br>a person who does not love cannot be entrusted with that kind of power.
    <br>Matthew 5:44 - "Love your neighbour. Pray for those who persecute you".
    <br>If you love your neighbour, you will pray for your enemy and pray for those who persecute you.
    <br>The love of God sees beyond hatred.
    <br>It is unlimited.
    <br>Our love becomes our protection against the hatred of the adversary.
    <br>Jesus clearly links faith to forgiveness.
    <br>And the book of Galatians 5 is simply saying here that faith works by love - love to God and to your fellow brother.
    <br>Faith thus working by love is all in all in our Christianity.
    <br>If we are not forgiving, the power of faith is short-circuited
    <br>because you cannot act with God and when you cannot act with God,
    <br>you cannot know God's opinion about yourself and about others.
    <br>This is the circle of life.
    <br>If we are not forgiving, the power of faith is short-circuited.
    <br>Why? Because a person who does not love or who will not forgive cannot be entrusted
    <br>with that kind of power to heal, power to redeem, power to save, power to deliver.
    <br>FAITH WORKS BY LOVE!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Praying is not saying words.
    <br>The power comes not in the saying, but in the praying of the prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The power comes not in the saying, but in the praying of the prayer.
    <br>Open the book of Romans 12:2 - "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world,
    <br>but be transformed by the renewing of your mind."
    <br>The power of the Lord's Prayer is not in the words, but rather in the pattern
    <br>of our thinking, in which our minds are formed.
    <br>Praying is not saying words,
    <br>but you are good in saying words.
    <br>When you pray, what an unspeakable comfort.
    <br>Galatians 5:6 - "... The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love."
    <br>It works by love - love to God, love to your brethren.
    <br>When you love, you will be entrusted with this kind of power.
    <br>But when you do not love, you cannot be entrusted. Why?
    <br>Because you will misappropriate it.
    <br>That is, you will use it to hurt yourself and others.
    <br>FAITH WORKS BY LOVE!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>And the Bible says that He will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy.
    <br>FAITH WORKS BY LOVE!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Why should you now 'send back to sender'?
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Change your prayer point.
    <br>FAITH WORKS BY LOVE!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>He will set a table before you in the presence of your enemy,
    <br>and those things on the table are the essentials of life.
    <br>FAITH WORKS BY LOVE!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>You want me to die and I say you should live and see the glory of God.
    <br>One great errand we have to the throne of grace is to pray for the pardon of our sins.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: One great errand we have to the throne of grace is to pray for the pardon of our sins.
    <br>It was Jesus' great design to engage His disciples to love one another.
    <br>If you want your prayer to be answered, there must not be anything between you and God.
    <br>In order to pray effectually, there must not be anything between you and God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Our relationship with God depends far more than we think,
    <br>upon our adjustment to one another.
    <br>In order to pray effectually, there must not be anything between us and God.
    <br>But our relationship with God depends far more than we think,
    <br>upon our adjustment to one another.
    <br>It was Jesus' great design to engage His disciples to love one another,
    <br>because faith works by love.
    <br>A person who does not love or who will not forgive cannot be entrusted
    <br>with this kind of power to heal, to deliver, to bless, to set free.
    <br>Why? Because you will use it to hurt yourself and others with it.
    <br>You will misappropriate it.
    <br>That is why Paul makes it clear that faith works by love.
    <br>You say you love your neighbour.
    <br>Look at your community - there are needy, fatherless, orphans, widows, physically challenged.
    <br>And you have a lot of money in the bank, while people are suffering, crying for help.
    <br>You say you are a Christian.
    <br>You have failed to realise that the life of a Christian is a race.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The life of a Christian is a race.
    <br>That is why Paul makes it clear that, "I have fought the fight of faith; I have kept the faith".
    <br>You must run and hold on if you would obtain the prize.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: You must run and hold on if you would obtain the prize.
    <br>In your garage, there are a fleet of cars.
    <br>In your warehouse, there are unused materials.
    <br>We all pray for the anointing to save, to deliver, to bless.
    <br>How does this come? By love.
    <br>It is not enough that we profess Christianity.
    <br>We must run the race well by giving up to that profession.
    <br>FAITH WORKS BY LOVE!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>It is not enough that we profess Christianity.
    <br>We must run the race well by giving up to that profession.
    <br>FAITH WORKS BY LOVE!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Tell your neighbour: It is not enough that you profess Christianity.
    <br>You must run the race well by giving up to that profession.
    <br>Dead men don't have faith.
    <br>You were elected before the foundation of the world.
    <br>The faith you finally exercised to receive Jesus
    <br>was that which God Himself put in your heart.
    <br>Jesus declared that no one can come unto Him, except the Father in Heaven draws him - in that book of John 6:44.
    <br>Everything you have and everything you will have in your future comes from God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Everything I have and everything I will have in my future comes from God.
    <br>Giving offers us an opportunity to reshape our destiny.
    <br>Let someone say: It was by love.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The right time to give to the needy is when you have little.
    <br>That is when you can give what your life depends on.
    <br>There's a way that seems right to man, but at the end it leads to destruction -  Proverbs 14:12.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Open your lips and ask Jesus.
    <br>By amazing grace, amazing love,
    <br>God looked at Daniel - a slave - and saw in him a leader.
    <br>FAITH WORKS BY LOVE!!!
    <br>T.B. Joshua Sermon
    <br>Ask Jesus, say, "Look at me - a sinner - and have mercy on me". Prayer.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>May God bless His Word.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Thank You, Father.
    <br>FAITH WORKS BY LOVE!!!
