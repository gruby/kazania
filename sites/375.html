    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>On Sunday the 20th of April 2014 during a live Sunday Service at The SCOAN,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message concerning an attack
    <br>which he saw would occur in a French-speaking country.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>In a French country, this is France,
    <br>I'm seeing an attack;
    <br>there will be an attack there.
    <br>They should take note of Wednesday and Thursday.
    <br>I will ask them to play it on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The following week, during The SCOAN live service on Sunday the 27th of April 2014,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua spoke further about the vision God had given him
    <br> concerning the French-speaking country.
    <br>He mentioned that the perpetrators were still in town
    <br>and specified the location in which he saw the attack occur - Paris, the capital city of France. 
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>The nation, a French-speaking country which I said last Sunday -
    <br>these people are still in the town - French-speaking.
    <br>I was saying last week in Paris - that was the location I saw last week.
    <br>Breaking News, out of Paris, an attack at the office of a well-known French satirical magazine
    <br>has left at least 10 people dead.
    <br>We are hearing two heavily armed gun men stormed into Charlie Hebdo's office in Paris.
    <br>You may recall that office was fire bombed and severely damaged several years ago
    <br>in response to cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed.
    <br>We will go straight to CNN's Jim Bitterman in Paris.
    <br>Jim, bring us the very latest update. 10 dead, among them police officers.
    <br>That's according to the prosecutor's office; it could actually be higher than that.
    <br>We are still waiting for confirmation.
    <br>There are numbers that are being reported as high as 11
    <br>that have been killed in this attack this morning and the number of people injured.
    <br>Basically, the gun men, according to eye witnesses, went into the offices
    <br>during the editorial meeting this morning
    <br>as editors, reporters and cartoonists had gathered around and started shooting.
    <br>The attack went on for about five minutes and according to some eye witnesses,
    <br>the attackers were armed with a rocket launcher as well as some machine guns.
    <br>It looks like it was a very well prepared attack.
    <br>The men were dressed in black. The two men were dressed in black.
    <br>Police gave pursuit, and a number of police officers have been injured,
    <br>one, as you mentioned, may have been killed,
    <br>pursing the gun men as they were running away from the scene.
    <br>In a French country, this is France.
    <br>I'm seeing an attack;
    <br>there will be an attack there.
    <br>They should take note of Wednesday and Thursday.
    <br>I will ask them to play it on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>We believe that you have been inspired by the clip that you have just watched.
