  <p>    
    <br>My name is Doreen Goge.
    <br>I come from South Africa.
    <br>My testimony goes like this: I used to sell sweets because I did not have work.
    <br>We suffered because nobody in my family went to school.
    <br>Now, the other day...
    <br>My neighbour had a television in her house.
    <br>So, when I was not selling sweets, I would visit my neighbour and watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>While watching Emmanuel TV, I was shocked to see Prophet T.B. Joshua’s biography
    <br>and how he had started The SCOAN.
    <br>I saw how after he had built the first church building, it was destroyed by a flood.
    <br>I saw how many obstacles he faced while he was building the church.
    <br>I saw how much Prophet T.B. Joshua had suffered and how Jesus solved his problems.
    <br>That day, I cried; the Holy Spirit touched me that day.
    <br>I prayed and asked God to help me the way He had helped the man of God.
    <br>I was crying and praying as I went back to my home.
    <br>There was no television in my house.
    <br>So, I would go to my friend’s house and ask her to please let me watch Emmanuel TV and she did.
    <br>One day, while I was watching Emmanuel TV, Prophet T.B. Joshua started praying for the viewers.
    <br>I touched the screen of my friend’s television and prayed along with the man of God.
    <br>I would cry and pray along with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV every day.
    <br>I am better today because I am no longer crying but then, I cried terribly.
    <br>Every time Prophet T.B. Joshua talks, the Holy Spirit is there.
    <br>I confirm today that Prophet T.B. Joshua is a man of God who does everything, in Jesus’ name.
    <br>Now, I have started afresh.
    <br>I have left all my trouble with God.
    <br>That time, I did not look at my trouble
    <br>but rather, I would pray along with the man of God on Emmanuel TV all the time.
    <br>Sometimes, I would not be able to watch Emmanuel TV at my friend’s house
    <br>because her child would want to watch another channel.
    <br>So, I prayed that the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua should give me the power to pray every day in my house.
    <br>People of God, many things will happen in your life
    <br>if you listen very well to what Prophet T.B. Joshua says all the time.
    <br>I used to be an activist for my political party but I was never nominated for any position.
    <br>I did not understand it.
    <br>Only after I prayed along with Prophet T.B. Joshua daily, did people start recognising me.
    <br>They no longer saw me as a woman who was suffering but as a strong woman
    <br>because of the strength that the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua gave me.
    <br>I told everybody that God is the answer.
    <br>One day, people of God, they told me that there was a position open
    <br>and that I had been nominated to be a Councillor in my political party.
    <br>They nominated my name because of the power of God in my life through the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I couldn’t believe that I was nominated to be a Councillor.
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>At the time they nominated me, I couldn’t speak English but now, I can.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>Mumma says, then she couldn't speak English but now she is better, she can express herself clearly.
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>After I started working in the government as a Councillor,
    <br>they decided that all the Councillors in the country who did not go to school should go back.
    <br>I started at level one and passed because I prayed everyday with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>I graduated.
    <br>Here you can see me in my graduation gown.
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>It was the first time I had taken a step to graduate.
    <br>I am very happy.
    <br>Everybody should please clap their hands and celebrate with me.
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>It' OK.
    <br>You work "nice" for the people; me, I am doing my best but I am an "old school".
    <br>After graduating, I build a house.
    <br>Before, I had no money and I was selling sweets.
    <br>Now, for the first time, I can go to the bank to draw money.
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to bless me more and more.
    <br>When I started receiving my salary, I opened a bank account which I did not have before.
    <br>I could withdraw 10,000 rands at a time – a woman who once sold sweets for a living.
    <br>I started saving my money and after one year, I withdrew more than 100,000 rands
    <br>with which I built a house.
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>This is my house and there are many rooms in my house.
    <br>I don’t owe any debts on this house.
    <br>I have finished paying for it.
    <br>Even my son who was suffering is now staying with me in my home.
    <br>The people in my country love me.
    <br>I was able to achieve all this because of praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was also able to buy a brand new car – the latest model.
    <br>I am learning how to drive now.
    <br>As you can see on these photos, I don’t stay at home.
    <br>Every day, I wake up early to go and see this old grandmother.
    <br>This is a picture showing that I work with and help people of different races.
    <br>I give charity to old people and I work with people of all ethnic groups in my country.
    <br>What I have achieved today is because of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua for taking me from a place where my potential was hidden
    <br>to a place where people all over the world can recognise me.
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>OK.
    <br>You should look at life from God’s point of view – as a child of God, you should shine every day.
    <br>When you listen to God, He will tell you many things.
    <br>As a Councillor, God told me to take my money and use it to solve people’s problems.
    <br>If you listen to God, He will give you back to you in abundance.
    <br>I want to tell you everyone to look to God, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Listen to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>God speaks to Prophet T.B. Joshua and he in turn, gives the message to people all over the world.
    <br>Take it!
    <br>Everything you have today is from God.
    <br>Therefore, listen to God; don’t listen to all the trouble around you.
    <br>There is so much trouble out there; listen to God all the time!
    <br>Thank you very much!
    <br>Mrs Doreen Goge
    <br>Emmanuel TV Testimony
    <br>Mumma, what advice would you give to people who are going through the same situation as you were before?
    <br>I never turn the television off in my house.
    <br>When I go to work, Emmanuel TV is always on in my home.
    <br>When I go to work, Emmanuel TV is always on in my home because it is a deterrent to evil.
    <br>When I come back from work, I always praise God.
    <br>People should pray to God all the time, no matter what because the devil is a liar.
    <br>The devil is not a man but a dog.
    <br>God is the only God.
    <br>Listen to Emmanuel TV and Prophet T.B. Joshua all the time.
    <br>The God of Prophet T.B. Joshua is the answer.
    <br>Thank you very much.
