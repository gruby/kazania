  <p>    
    <br>My name is Eugene Akwuwayo-Kwachi.
    <br>I am 46 years old.
    <br>I am a Ghanaian.
    <br>Based on the things that I heard about The SCOAN, that
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua was an ordinary human being
    <br>and he entered his room for seven good days and he came out to be a prophet,
    <br>that he lived in a secluded area where nobody touches him - under water.
    <br>All the powers he used are by demonic means.
    <br>With this, I harboured a deep-seated hatred for the man of God and The SCOAN as a whole.
    <br>Along the line, one of my house fellowship members
    <br>stopped coming to the church as well as the house.
    <br>So, one day I made enquiries about it and I sent one of my members,
    <br>those who are very good, to go and enquire about this brother.
    <br>So, when I came back, I was told that the brother was now at The SCOAN.
    <br>So, with this, I organised a prayer meeting in my house fellowship, three of us.
    <br>We prayed seriously for the brother.
    <br>Even upon that, my church organised a 40 day all night vigil.
    <br>Within this, we were praying about all kinds of demonic churches, The SCOAN inclusive.
    <br>We used to pray, "In the name of Jesus! In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>The blood of Jesus!
    <br>The precious blood of Jesus!
    <br>We release the brimstone of fire to The SCOAN, to dissolve all the power that they use in the church
    <br>and to bring back our brothers, those who are confused,
    <br>that the Lord Almighty should open the eyes of their understanding."
    <br>As we were saying this, even our church, where we used to have
    <br>double services in the morning and afternoon, you see that even our members are still dwindling.
    <br>So, with this, it became a problem.
    <br>I also heard along the line that the man of God, Pastor T.B. Joshua, travelled to Ghana
    <br>to destroy my people, my own fatherland.
    <br>In fact, I became very mad.
    <br>I had a hatred in me.
    <br>I began to pray.
    <br>I said, "Oh God. This is the time for You to show Your powers.
    <br>For Elijah prayed and fire came down to consume his enemies.
    <br>So whatever the man of God went to Ghana to do, let the fire destroy all his powers."
    <br>In fact, I didn't know that I was doing it to myself.
    <br>Problems started coming my way.
    <br>On the following weekend, that was Sunday, my 9 years old daughter called me,
    <br>"Daddy, let's go to The SCOAN."
    <br>I nearly chopped off my daughter's head.
    <br>I said, "What do you know about The SCOAN?"
    <br>"What do you want to do about The SCOAN?" I left her.
    <br>I didn't mind her.
    <br>I went on my way.
    <br>I have harboured a doubt about the church.
    <br>I have prayed seriously, negatively, concerning the man of God and The SCOAN as a whole.
    <br>It was ignorance.
    <br>Little did I know, even the brother who left my house fellowship, I went to the brother again.
    <br>Before you know it, the brother had hired a shop and started a barbing salon with a generator.
    <br>I said, "Yes, this boy has received demon power, so why won't he be rich?"
    <br>A brother that I know doesn't know anything but has become prosperous?
    <br>I said, "Yes, this boy has received demon power.
    <br>So automatically, he has become rich."
    <br>This made me to pray all the more with my members against the church.
    <br>Little did I know that I was doing all this to myself.
    <br>A lot of atrocities have gone out of my life.
    <br>I have done a lot of things.
    <br>I practised occultism, Buddhism.
    <br>In a nutshell, I am a fornicator; I am an adulterer.
