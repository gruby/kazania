    <br>HEALED OF POOR VISION THROUGH EMMANUEL TV!!!
    <br>My name is Helena Mbanga from Tanzania.
    <br>I am here to give a testimony after praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I could not read or write anything without using spectacles for over 20 years!
    <br>As a teacher, I had a difficult time in preparing notes and marking my books and exams.
    <br>On trying to get a remedy for my problem, I visited the eye specialist back in 1995.
    <br>The doctor advised me to use first, eye drops, after which he told me to use spectacles.
    <br>These are some of the spectacles I used back then.
    <br>It was purely by grace that I discovered Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I stayed glued to it after seeing the wonderful works of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Then, something miraculous happened to me!
    <br>To the glory of God, I received my healing
    <br>by simply praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>After that prayer, I could read words displayed on the television
    <br>and I was able to read messages on my phone without using spectacles.
    <br>I am totally healed by Jesus. I can read and write without using spectacles.
    <br>I am going to read you Psalm 117.
    <br>"Praise the Lord, all you nations; extol Him, all you peoples.
    <br>For great is His love towards us, and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever.
    <br>Praise the Lord."
    <br>Thank You, Jesus; I'm totally healed!
    <br>I can read and write without spectacles.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Do you have a testimony?
    <br>Submit your testimony now!
