    83 - LOVE IS THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON TB Joshua Sermon
  </h3>
  <p>
    Hallelujah!
    <br>LOVE IS THE GREATEST
    <br>Let love lead.
    <br>Let's quickly go to Matthew 5:44.
    <br>"But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you,
    <br>do good to those who hate you,
    <br>and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you".
    <br>Wow.
    <br>The challenges we are having can be likened to love and hatred.
    <br>That is the battle before you can be likened to love and hatred.
    <br>Since I was born, I read my Bible.
    <br>I have never seen where hatred overcomes love.
    <br>When you love, you overcome.
    <br>I read my Bible from Genesis to Revelation; the Bible is my standard.
    <br>I have never seen where hatred overcomes love.
    <br>When you love, you overcome.
    <br>Love is the most powerful weapon.
    <br>Love does not allow us to kill.
    <br>Love does not allow us to kill our brothers, neighbours - even our enemies.
    <br>Love does not allow us to kill them.
    <br>Remember the words of Jesus - love your enemies.
    <br>Love becomes our protection against the hatred of the adversary.
    <br>LOVE IS THE GREATEST
    <br>Hatred is powerless in the face of love's power and armour.
    <br>Let someone say,
    <br>LOVE IS THE GREATEST
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Let us act love.
    <br>Let us do love.
    <br>Do love; act love.
    <br>We are sons of love; we are love's products.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>Love brought us into being.
    <br>We are love's products, the sons and daughters of love.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Let us do love.
    <br>Let us act love.
    <br>We are love's products, the sons and daughters of love.
    <br>Love brought us into being.
    <br>That is love.
    <br>Love is the Greatest | Full Sermon & Worship | TB Joshua
    <br>The challenges before us; when I say challenges before us...
    <br>If you want to be a Christian, be a Christian.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>If you want to be a Christian, be a Christian.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(If you want to be a Christian, be a Christian.)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(If you want to be a Christian, be a Christian.)
    <br>The reason why I am saying it is that the challenges before us -
    <br>no one can overcome without the Spirit of God.
    <br>Who is a Christian? That is the question we need to ask ourselves.
    <br>A Christian is someone who is lifting the load with God.
    <br>I'm a Christian.
    <br>If I carry it here, God is carrying it here.
    <br>You with God are majority.
    <br>It is like the whole world is carrying the load.
    <br>A Christian is someone who is lifting the load with God.
    <br>Who is a Christian?
    <br>A Christian is someone who is walking with the Lord.
    <br>A Christian is someone who is facing persecution and trials with the Lord.
    <br>If you want to be a Christian, be a Christian and stop deceiving yourself
    <br>because the challenges before us will consume you.
    <br>I define again.
    <br>Who is a Christian?
    <br>A Christian is someone who is in unison with God.
    <br>You know what it means?
    <br>If God is joining you to carry something,
    <br>when you are facing persecution, God is facing persecution with you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>If you want to be a Christian, be a Christian.
    <br>No one can be a Christian without the Spirit of God.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Let's look at 1 Corinthians 12 from verse 3.
    <br>"Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God
    <br>calls Jesus accursed,
    <br>and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit".
    <br>If you are worshipping God without depending on the Spirit of God,
    <br>you are serving a god you do not know.
    <br>If you worship God without the Spirit of God, you will only hear yourself
    <br>and people around you will hear you but God will not hear you in your act of worship.
    <br>"Hallelujah", without the Spirit of God - you will only hear yourself, people around you will hear you.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus..." - you will only hear yourself, people around you will hear you.
    <br>You dance during the worship - you only see yourself, people around you will see you.
    <br>You fast and pray in your act of worship -
    <br>if you do this without the Spirit of God, you will only hear yourself,
    <br>people around you will hear you - God will not hear you.
    <br>God's opinion and God's idea about your act of worship - praying, fasting,
    <br>dancing, worship, just name them -
    <br>will be meaningless, idle and oftentimes destructive.
    <br>If God cannot hear you, satan will hear you.
    <br>Let's take this Book again; 1 Corinthians 12:3.
    <br>"Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking..."
    <br>Wow, it is an abomination there.
    <br>No one speaking about Jesus without what?
    <br>Listen to what they say here.
    <br>No one speaks about Jesus of Nazareth without the Spirit of God.
    <br>But today, you speak about Jesus without the Spirit of God.
    <br>Is that not abomination?
    <br>Today, you speak about Jesus without the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God.
    <br>Today you dance, pray, fast, speak about Jesus without the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Let us read once again.
    <br>"Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God
    <br>calls Jesus accursed."
    <br>What are we talking about here?
    <br>Ignorantly, you believed and you thought you were serving God
    <br>but the Lord does not hear you.
    <br>It is like a switch.
    <br>If I switch off...
    <br>What happened?
    <br>It is off.
    <br>Let's assume this is God.
    <br>If I want to use it - through what?
    <br>That is the Spirit of God.
    <br>Without the switch, it is dead.
    <br>No life.
    <br>In the same vein, God, without the Spirit of God, you are serving a dead god.
    <br>Love is the Greatest | Full Sermon & Worship | TB Joshua
    <br>Dead, lifeless, without the Spirit.
    <br>If you worship God without God's Spirit in your act of worshipping -
    <br>praying, fasting, praising, dancing - you will only hear yourself
    <br>and people around you will hear you but God will not hear you.
    <br>Once again.
    <br>If you worship God without God's Spirit,
    <br>I mean, in your act of worship, prayer, praises, fasting, dancing, tithing...
    <br>You pay huge tithes to the church,
    <br>you build a cathedral like this - only you without God's Spirit,
    <br>people inside the church and the whole world will know you are the one who built this synagogue church,
    <br>and you yourself will know you are the one who built the church,
    <br>but God will not know you have built a church for Him.
    <br>Love is the Greatest | Full Sermon & Worship | TB Joshua
    <br>God's opinion, idea about your acts of worship will be meaningless, idle,
    <br>oftentimes destructive because if God cannot hear you, satan will hear you.
    <br>This is why today, you pray for healing and attack comes.
    <br>This is why today you fast for three, ten days;
    <br>because God cannot hear you, satan will strike you.
    <br>The battle before us, the challenges before us -
    <br>without God's Spirit, we will be defeated.
    <br>You know, we are in a perilous time, a dangerous time.
    <br>What has happened in Nigeria has happened in a different way in every country.
    <br>In a different form, it has happened in your country.
    <br>The battle before you - without God's Spirit, we will be defeated, crushed and grounded.
    <br>I have given you once again a sample of God's Spirit:
    <br>switch - it is always plugged.
    <br>God is always in action because He is the Creator of everyone.
    <br>Look: this is plugged already - to tell you that it is always in action.
    <br>Yes, it is ready to work because He is concerned about you.
    <br>But if it is off here, you cannot use it again; it is off.
    <br>People will see you having this in your house, but why are you still using fan?
    <br>Because you have not put it on.
    <br>To put it on is to depend on God's Spirit.
    <br>This is God's Spirit.
    <br>But it is always connected.
    <br>When you disown Him, that cannot overthrow Him from His throne.
    <br>When you accept Him, that cannot remove Him from His throne.
    <br>If you choose not to accept Him and deny Him, stand against Him,
    <br>that cannot deploy Him from His throne - He is God.
    <br>And God - the plug is always on.
    <br>The question...
    <br>If you want to be a Christian, be a Christian.
    <br>No one can be a Christian without God's Spirit.
    <br>A Christian is the one who is lifting the load with God.
    <br>A Christian is the one who is walking with the Lord.
    <br>A Christian is the one who is facing persecution and trials with the Lord.
    <br>A Christian is the one who is in unison with the Lord.
    <br>Am I depending on God's Spirit to worship?
    <br>What is God's Spirit?
    <br>Acting on the Word brings about God's Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>(Acting on the Word brings about God's Spirit.)
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>(Acting on the Word brings about God's Spirit.)
    <br>The Bible says, God's power working through His Word and His Spirit brings about salvation.
    <br>Acting on the Word brings about God's Spirit.
    <br>How do we act on the Word?
    <br>The Word builds Christ's nature.
    <br>God is building Himself into us, making Himself a part of us.
    <br>You can read about God, but about God's Spirit...
    <br>It takes someone who is swimming, who is endowed in that Spirit to talk about it.
    <br>It is a sacred place.
    <br>I have given you how to operate in God's Spirit.
    <br>One: acting on the Word.
    <br>How do we act on the Word?
    <br>Is it just by reading our Bible?
    <br>You have been reading and you have the knowledge,
    <br>but you must read with devotion, as if your life depends on knowing it.
    <br>How do we read this Word?
    <br>Some read and commit it to memory
    <br>while others read and commit it to their hearts.
    <br>Anything that is here becomes an integral part of you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Anything that is here becomes part of your blood.
    <br>I want to leave you here - thank you.
