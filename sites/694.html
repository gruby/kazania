    <br>- You would have been in the prison yard
    <br>- I would have been in prison
    <br>because I am seeing you are addicted to something.
    <br>You should pray.
    <br>And it wants to run you mental.
    <br>You know, to run mental.
    <br>In the past you would have been on the streets.
    <br>God loves you.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Prayer & Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>It is a hard one.
    <br>You are into a hard one.
    <br>You just need deliverance. After the deliverance you will be free.
    <br>You have three guys - they are your friends; you have to cut off from them.
    <br>- Okay?
    <br>- Okay.
    <br>If not, you will still go back to your old life.
    <br>- Okay?
    <br>- Okay.
    <br>After the prayer you need counselling. Thank you.
    <br>Prophet TB Joshua Ministering Prayer & Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>There is a case. Ok. I will see you.
    <br>I understand now. I have been doing drugs my whole life.
    <br>I would have been in prison many times.
    <br>God has protected me from my foolish mistakes of selling and doing drugs.
    <br>There is no reason for me not to be dead.
    <br>I have been mental from the drugs.
    <br>I touched the anointing sticker, saw you on Emmanuel TV
    <br>and touched the screen and was free instantly.
    <br>You are free now.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>My name is Gabriel Fain.
    <br>I am 22 years old, from the United States of America.
    <br>I have been doing drugs since I was 13 years old - 9 years ago.
    <br>I tried to be a good person, I tried to do the right thing, but I was held back.
    <br>I had strict parents. My mom is a senior police officer and my father is a pastor.
    <br>While I was stuck in the middle of this, I broke free [from drugs] for a while - I got clean for a little bit -
    <br>and I went and studied ministry under a pastor in Washington.
    <br>But as I was there studying ministry under that pastor, they had spice which is synthetic marijuana,
    <br>and I had done everything from meth, heroin, it did not matter.
    <br>I got there and spice was the one that got me.
    <br>I ended up smoking it and it started to make me go mental, like the prophet prophesied.
    <br>My whole life I had done drugs and I should be in prison, like he had prophesied.
    <br>But I got there and I started smoking that.
    <br>I would sneak away and I would smoke it.
    <br>It makes you socially awkward. So I would end up ...
    <br>They would know that I was on something because I would think they were talking, but I was talking
    <br>and it was a bad thing.
    <br>I ended up getting caught smoking downstairs by a lady who lived there as well.
    <br>She said, "Give me the pipe. Give me the drugs" and I refused. I said, "No".
    <br>I was ashamed, so I left.
    <br>And when I left, I was homeless.
    <br>I slept in my car in a friend of mine's parking lot.
    <br>I would go from there to the drug.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>We heard from our brother. He said that his name is Gabriel and he has come here from the United States of America.
    <br>He said that exactly as the man of God prophesied to him, he should be in the prison yard right now.
    <br>He said that for the past 9 years he had an addiction to many different kinds of drugs.
    <br>Despite the fact that he had strict parents - his father was a pastor and his mother was a senior police officer -
    <br>this did not deter him or stop him from entering a wayward life that led him into taking many hard drugs,
    <br>just as the man of God mentioned.
    <br>He was telling us that as he went into a school of ministry,
    <br>this was actually the place when he was staying in a church,
    <br>that he started on the hard drug called spice.
    <br>So tell us, how did you get involved in taking these drugs in the first place?
    <br>What was it that introduced you to taking these drugs?
    <br>In Oregon, where I am from, they had it for a little bit and I had smoked it prior,
    <br>but then they cancelled it - they made it illegal.
    <br>When I moved to Washington where I was studying ministry, it was legal.
    <br>So I kind of had a relation to come back to it.
    <br>However, the drugs they have in Washington are legal,  so they spray it. Who knows what is on it.
    <br>And so I started and I continued.
    <br>What happened after you ran away from the church, from the ministry,
    <br>and started staying in your car in a parking lot?
    <br>I would smoke it and I would pass out - I would black out - and I would not know that I had blacked out.
    <br>I would wake up and there would be burn holes in my car seat, in my clothes.
    <br>So that means that I passed out with it lit.
    <br>I ended up getting out of my car one time to go to the bathroom
    <br>and when I got out to go to the bathroom I completely blacked out
    <br>and I came back to [my senses] and I was walking.
    <br>And I walked into three police officers. They were around me and said, "You could be in a lot of trouble".
    <br>And I said, "For what?".
    <br>I could barely speak at this point. I had started going mental.
    <br>But I got it out of my mouth. I said, "For what?".
    <br>They said, "For exposing yourself".
    <br>I guess that when I went to the bathroom, I just pulled my pants down and started walking.
    <br>That is how these police officers came up to me.
    <br>What we have heard from our brother is that while he had run away from the church,
    <br>and was smoking this drug on a daily basis,
    <br>he said that the drug would often make him pass out - even only just when smoking a little bit of it.
    <br>When he passed out, he would not know what he was doing.
    <br>Sometimes he would wake up and find himself walking.
    <br>Other times he would wake up sleeping on his car seat.
    <br>He said that one time that he went to go and ease himself after waking up from smoking, he was not conscious.
    <br>He actually took down his whole trousers and exposed himself in public.
    <br>Three police officers came to him, saying that he might be in a lot of trouble for exposing himself in public.
    <br>All of this was as a result of smoking the spice drug that he had been taking, which had been changing his mind.
    <br>As he said, it was making him begin to run mental - just according to the prophecy of the man of God.
    <br>What happened when the police officers came to you and were interrogating you?
    <br>I told them that I had smoked spice, because I knew that it was legal there. So I knew that I might be OK.
    <br>But my keys were still in my car, so they could have arrested me.
    <br>It was by the grace of God that they did not.
    <br>I ended up saying, "I smoked spice and I don't know where I am".
    <br>And they said, "Where are your shoes?", and I looked down and I was not wearing shoes.
    <br>I said, "I don't know where my shoes are. Do you guys know where my car is?".
    <br>They said, "It is right over there", after I had described it to them.
    <br>I said, "Where?". I could not see this far in front of my face. It was as if there was a fog, so I could not see my car.
    <br>They put me in the back of the police car and began to ask me questions.
    <br>I said, "I will be fine in 30 minutes. I will sober up. I will be OK. I just need time to let this release".
    <br>Instead of arresting me - as Prophet TB Joshua said -
    <br>by the grace of God, they let me go to McDonalds to wait it out there. So I waited there.
    <br>After I waited and the police left, I went back to the car and started smoking.
    <br>We have heard from our brother that when the police were interrogating him,
    <br>they asked him where his shoes were and he suddenly discovered that he was not wearing shoes
    <br>and at that time of the year it was very cold -
    <br>a time where he would need thick shoes and thick socks to take care of himself.
    <br>Then, instead of arresting or apprehending him, they sat him in the police car in order to sober up,
    <br>and then allowed him to go to McDonalds to go and sit down and wait for the drug to pass and him to be sober.
    <br>This was not the normal or usual behaviour - he was supposed to have been arrested even at that point,
    <br>which was part of the prophecy, by the grace of God, that he was not in prison at this time.
    <br>He said that immediately when the drugs cleared and he sobered himself, he went straight back to his car
    <br>and continued smoking this drug that he had been addicted to for the past 9 years.
    <br>After then my mother found out that I was homeless, so she wired me money. She sent me $150.
    <br>My intentions were to get a hotel room.
    <br>But after I got the money, the spirit attached to the drug that wanted me to go mental kept me from spending it on that.
    <br>I figured that I had a car. I would be OK.
    <br>I ended up buying more drugs with that money. I had blacked out, then I woke up.
    <br>I had $20 left and there were four empty spice packets.
    <br>It only takes a little amount to knock you out.
    <br>I don't know how I blacked out and woke up and there were four empty packets of spice,
    <br>unless I was blacked out smoking them.
    <br>But when I woke up, my brain was completely fried.
    <br>I could not talk. I could not do anything. My lungs were filling up with fluid.
    <br>I knew that I was going to die if I bought that last packet - it was put into my heart.
    <br>And I felt like death, as it was.
    <br>When I decided to fight as I knew I was going to die, I cried out to God.
    <br>I said, "Lord, I gave up the alcohol. I gave up the sex. I will give up this drug. But I can't stop myself".
    <br>Shortly after that, the pastor messaged me and said, "Where are you?".
    <br>I said, "I am at the gas station", but I was actually across the street, at the store which sells the spice.
    <br>But I knew that he would see my car. I wanted to be caught, but I was too ashamed to admit where I was.
    <br>When I was there, he ended up finding me.
    <br>You heard him saying that after his encounter with the police,
    <br>the addiction to the drugs even got worse,
    <br>to the extent that after his mother sent him $150 to take care of himself, he did not do that.
    <br>Rather, he continued buying more of the drugs, until one time he woke up with four empty packets of the drug.
    <br>He said that normally it just takes a little pinch to get you so high that you blackout or you become unconscious,
    <br>but he had finished four entire packets of the drug.
    <br>With only $20 remaining, his choice was to go and get one more packet of drugs
    <br>and his heart was telling him that if he took this one last packet he would die.
    <br>And he prayed that God Almighty should have mercy on him.
    <br>And at that time his pastor called him and came and found him at the parking lot.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus.
    <br>What happened next?
    <br>I cried out and the pastor came.
    <br>I felt that God was telling me, "You are going to have to go through humility. You need to humble yourself.
    <br>Your pride is gone. If I am going to use you, your pride needs to be gone".
    <br>I said, "Ok. Take my pride".
    <br>The pastor took me to the airport, because this was over Christmas,
    <br>and I realised at the airport that I was really mental and I could not talk to anybody.
    <br>The pastor gave me Prophet TB Joshua's anointing sticker and my plane ticket - that is all that I left with.
    <br>When I arrived at the airport, I could not talk to people so I would hand them my anointing sticker and the ticket.
    <br>I would mumble and they would look at me as though I was crazy.
    <br>That was when I was humbling myself, because the pride was gone.
    <br>I walked up to three girls that were there and I handed them my ticket and the anointing sticker.
    <br>They said, "Oh, hop in" - they had a wheelchair.
    <br>I did not know it at the time but they were joking. I got into the wheelchair and they started laughing.
    <br>After that I tried to get out but something kept me there, so they moved me to where I needed to be.
    <br>I met a man there who looked at the anointing sticker and he said, "This guy on the sticker ...".
    <br>I said, "Yes, God uses him. God uses Prophet TB Joshua more than anybody else on earth".
    <br>He looked at me and said, "I am a believer", and that gave me the faith to keep going.
    <br>I said, "Jesus is going to save me".
    <br>After I went through two airports, my mom was waiting for me in uniform as a police officer.
    <br>I walked past her and she did not even know who I was.
    <br>I had to wave her down; I had to flag my own mom down.
    <br>When we left the airport I got into her police car and I started vomiting and my body started convulsing,
    <br>and I felt as if I was going to die in front of my mom.
    <br>She took off work because I was too sick for her not to be there.
    <br>We went to the house and I was 'hospitalised' in my bedroom.
    <br>I could not eat, I could not sleep.
    <br>I lay in my bed for eight hours at a time, just losing my mind.
    <br>I kept wondering if I would remain mental like this for the rest of my life and whether I would recover.
    <br>I saw the look on my parents' and family's faces - they treated me as though I needed extra attention.
    <br>I ended up praying the whole time in my head.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>We can see the level that this drug took our brother down to finish his life and destroy him,
    <br>as he was explaining that the drug had turned him mental and that he was not able to talk or communicate.
    <br>Even when the pastor took him the airport and helped him to get his flight,
    <br>he did not know the way to the boarding gate.
    <br>When he met some people who were standing there, they jokingly said that he should get into the wheelchair
    <br>and they would help him get there. To their surprise, he actually sat down in the wheelchair,
    <br>showing the level that he had really begun to lose his mind at this stage.
    <br>It was the grace of God that actually saw him through the airports and got him back home.
    <br>He said that on arriving at his home town airport,
    <br>his mother was waiting for him dressed as a senior police officer
    <br>and that he walked straight past her and she did not recognise him.
    <br>He had to go in front of her and wave at her before she could recognise that this was him,
    <br>showing just how much this terrible habit of drugs - of what he was addicted to - had really destroyed his life.
    <br>Finally when he got home, at home he was not able to sleep, he was not able to eat.
    <br>He would just lie on his bed wondering whether this was how his life would end.
    <br>Would he continue being mad, being crazy and being uneasy like this?
    <br>This prompted his heart to start praying.
    <br>What happened from there?
    <br>I was praying and I felt as though God was speaking to my heart, "Turn on Emmanuel TV".
    <br>And I said, "Ok" and I turned on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>At that very instant that I turned it on, Prophet TB Joshua was praying for deliverance and touching the screen.
    <br>He said, "Touch your screen for your deliverance and you will be free, in Jesus' name".
    <br>So I touched the screen and I said, "I am going to be free, in Jesus' name. God is going to save me".
    <br>Shortly after I realised that I was speaking, I was talking. So I was delivered as I was praying for it.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Our brother was testifying that as he was on the bed praying, he remembered about Emmanuel TV
    <br>that the pastor had introduced to him and he turned on Emmanuel TV on the internet.
    <br>As he turned on Emmanuel TV, it was the time Prophet TB Joshua was offering prayer for the viewers.
    <br>He said that as the man of God was praying for people,
    <br>he came and put his hand on the screen and was praying along with the man of God,
    <br>saying, "I am delivered. I am healed. I am saved".
    <br>It was not until the end of the prayer time that he realised that he had started speaking for the first time
    <br>since he had travelled to get to his home state after taking those four packets of drugs.
    <br>Let us put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>What happened from there after you were praying with Emmanuel TV?
    <br>I ran outside my room and I said, "Mom, I am free! I can speak!".
    <br>I was really connected to God after that.
    <br>I was glad and blessed to be alive, as a result of His grace.
    <br>After God Almighty rescued your life at that time, what was it that finally brought you here to The SCOAN?
    <br>After that time I had remembered the prayer lines in the US that they had with Prophet TB Joshua's morning water
    <br>and that they had mentioned trips to visit The SCOAN.
    <br>So that is what I wanted to do next and I sent for the invitation.
    <br>And that is how today you are in our midst at The SCOAN. Is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Tell us also, the man of God mentioned that there are three friends that you have to disconnect from.
    <br>Tell us what has been your experience with these three friends?
    <br>I have known one of them since I was thirteen years old. We started doing the drugs together.
    <br>I had a foundation in God, so I would move towards God. He would move towards making more money.
    <br>And so when I started coming to God I broke free from him.
    <br>I did not talk to these friends; I did not hang out with them.
    <br>Then I ended up coming back to them and hanging out with them.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, his prophecy was,
    <br>"These three friends - you have to cut from them, disconnect from them or you will go back to your old life".
    <br>And that is absolutely true.
    <br>Had it ever happened to you in the past that you had tried to get off the drugs
    <br>and you had had a similar experience of going back through them?
    <br>Yes. For nine years I had been struggling going back and forth and I had almost died between 8 to 10 times.
    <br>There were so many times that I was pulled over by the police and I had a lot of drugs on me
    <br>that would have put me in prison.
    <br>At times when I was younger I had $20 000 worth of drugs.
    <br>At 16 years old I ruined my work ethic, I destroyed my life.
    <br>These friends in particular, how had you noticed they would come to you?
    <br>They would be there when I was doing drugs to hang out,
    <br>but then I would break free and I would be doing good for a while.
    <br>When I hit a weak spot, I was feeling weak or I just bored and I wanted to do something,
    <br>then this one friend in particular would always show up and be there.
    <br>That was how it was with the three of them, but the one was the one that I started with.
    <br>Now, since the prophecy and the deliverance that you received that day from the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua,
    <br>how are you feeling, how has your life been?
    <br>I feel good. I feel like my past is my past and the future is the future.
    <br>I want God's will to be done in my life, so I have given up my past and put it there.
    <br>Hallelujah. How are you feeling towards smoking drugs, taking drugs now? Do you still have that urge or desire?
    <br>No, I do not. I completely understand God's grace on my life and what He has done for me
    <br>and I don't want to do anything to disrupt or disturb that.
    <br>Hallelujah. Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>My advice would be: If you are doing drugs and you are younger - stop, quit your drugs and run to Jesus
    <br>because the devil is out there to steal your soul.
    <br>The things that I had lost along the way are not worth it.
    <br>Get to God and get your blessings.
    <br>Do not mess around with the devil's game.
    <br>Our dear brother, we thank God for your life and this wonderful testimony
    <br>that will go a long way to touch lives of people all over the world.
    <br>As God has done a wonderful thing in your life, we pray it will be permanent
    <br>as you continue to follow our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ and make His Word the standard for your life
    <br>to maintain this blessing and the many that follow this year, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
