    <br>T.B. Joshua is accessible but untouchable.
    <br>As he moves in the midst of huge congregation that gathers every week at The SCOAN,
    <br>he is letting the people know what God has to say concerning their situation,
    <br>giving them words of prophecy, as the Holy Spirit directs him to do so.
    <br>Exposing the root cause of problems they may be facing today, as messages of prophecy are given,
    <br>healing, deliverance and blessing take place.
    <br>Heavily pregnant woman cries out from her seat, obviously distressed by a problem she has found herself in.
    <br>See the way Prophet T.B. Joshua attends to this woman's case, using his foot as a point of contact,
    <br>to pray for the heavily pregnant woman who was seated among the crowd.
    <br>He continues to pray for her with his hand stretched towards her stomach and looking intently at the pregnancy.
    <br>Jesus takes over, as the power of God is brought on the scene.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Prophet Michael Osita Udem.
    <br>The woman beside me is my lovely wife, Mrs Jennifer Chidinma Udem.
    <br>The person beside her is my younger sister,
    <br>who just came from the east to help us nurse the babies.
    <br>We hail from Anambra State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought my wife to The SCOAN was breech presentation.
    <br>They said the baby was not positioned right.
    <br>They said they had to operate her so they booked her for an operation.
    <br>I became afraid when the doctor told me with their experience in the field, they couldn't deliver triples.
    <br>They said the pregnancy wouldn't reach nine months.
    <br>They said my wife should undergo an operation,
    <br>that we shouldn't allow the pregnancy to reach nine months.
    <br>We came here, the man of God prayed for my wife and the following day, labour started.
    <br>She delivered without an operation.
    <br>Put your hand together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>The names of my babies are Esther Chdinma Udem,
    <br>the second one is Caleb Chidindu Udem,
    <br>the third one is Joshua Chidebube Udem.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>They are here with three bouncing babies and he just said their wonderful names.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mrs Jennifer Chidinma Udem.
    <br>The problem that brought us here was overdue pregnancy.
    <br>The baby was in breech presentation.
    <br>When we got to the hospital, the doctor said I should undergo an operation.
    <br>I want to thank God for my mother-in-law
    <br>who said we should go to The SCOAN, where our problems would be solved.
    <br>I was lucky that when Prophet T.B. Joshua was prophesying, he came to me and prayed for me.
    <br>When he prayed for me, I felt a cold sensation all over my body.
    <br>The following day, labour started and I went to the hospital.
    <br>When we got to the hospital, I told the doctor that something was happening to me.
    <br>He said we should go to the labour room.
    <br>When we got to the labour room, he said that labour had started.
    <br>Brethren, I want you to thank God with me.
    <br>Within 30 minutes, I delivered these triplets without an operation.
    <br>TRIPLETS BORN After PASTOR PRAYS!!!
    <br>Without bleeding, within 30 minutes, I delivered triplets. I thank God.
    <br>Put your hands together for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ!
    <br>Our God is a miracle working God.
    <br>There is never a problem He cannot solve.
    <br>The first baby is a girl. Her name is Chidinma Esther Udem.
    <br>The second one is Caleb Chidindu Udem.
    <br>The third one is Chidebube Joshua Udem.
    <br>We give glory to God for the life of your beautiful babies and the life of your family.
    <br>What would be your advice to the viewers watching you right now?
    <br>My advice to viewers watching me right now is:
    <br>God that has done it for me will do it for everybody.
    <br>Truly, God who made it for these beautiful babies to come alive, without an operation, and giving a safe delivery,
    <br>will make it possible for you all here, in Jesus' name.
    <br>My advice to people watching me in this auditorium
    <br>and people around the world is that they should have patience.
    <br>The Lord who has done it for me
    <br>must surely visit every barren woman in this auditorium and those watching me right now on television, in Jesus' name.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Thank you very much for that wonderful advice.
    <br>We would like to advise you also that now, that God Almighty has delivered you through His Word,
    <br>you must be ruled by the Word of God, make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and train up these children in the way of the Lord, in Jesus' name.
