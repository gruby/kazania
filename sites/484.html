    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>A child is crying, a baby.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>He is crying, “Where is my father?”
    <br>There is a controversy over a child.
    <br>PROPHECY CONFIRMATION
    <br>My name is Ikenna Nnebor.
    <br>I am from Anambra State but I reside in Cameroon.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was business failure.
    <br>One night when I slept, I dreamt and saw Prophet T.B. Joshua and a small boy sitting on seats.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua told me to come.
    <br>There was water there so he asked me to go through it and come to him.
    <br>I said no because I would fall inside the water.
    <br>He told me to come.
    <br>I wanted to hold onto something but fell, yet the water was not deep.
    <br>When I reached T.B. Joshua, he started telling me many things.
    <br>After that, he gave me bread to eat. So, I ate it.
    <br>I then told my wife I wanted to go to The SCOAN in Nigeria.
    <br>I borrowed money and I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I reached The SCOAN, I sat at the back.
    <br>The man of God came to me and said that there was a child crying and asking about his father.
    <br>When the man of God gave me the prophecy, I was surprised.
    <br>I didn’t understand the prophecy.
    <br>I went to my hotel room and slept.
    <br>After the man of God gave me the prophecy, I saw everything in a dream.
    <br>I saw the lady and remembered that it was eight years ago.
    <br>I met with that girl in Ogbunike.
    <br>I remembered everything.
    <br>I came back to The SCOAN and explained to them.
    <br>They told me to go and find the child.
    <br>I sent my friend and sister to go and look for the boy.
    <br>When they asked her family, they said that the girl had already married but the grandmother was with the child.
    <br>I told them to ask the grandmother whose child it was.
    <br>The family said that they didn’t know his father.
    <br>The daughter told them that nobody cared about the boy.
    <br>The man of God told me to go and find the boy.
    <br>When I visited the family, I saw a little boy playing outside.
    <br>Something told me that this was the child.
    <br>One of my friends followed me there.
    <br>Something told me that this was my child.
    <br>I asked a woman there, who the child was.
    <br>They said that this was the child they talked about.
    <br>This was the child the man of God told me about.
    <br>From there, we discussed how to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>They said, they would follow me to The SCOAN to confirm the prophecy of the man of God.
    <br>It was an evangelist that called him to come, to stand and to think about what the man of God said.
    <br>He said, "No, there is nothing like that".
    <br>The evangelist then called him and said, "Take it easy. Go and think about it".
    <br>That is how this man walked out and went back to the hotel.
    <br>When he arrived at the hotel, he thought, "I came here with a problem and they tell me about a child.
    <br>A child is crying. What kind of a problem is this? This is another problem. I said that my business was down
    <br>and they now added another problem for me."
    <br>That is what he was thinking, "My business collapsed, I have nowhere to live.
    <br>Instead of this man solving my problem, he gives me another problem".
    <br>His heart was so disturbed.
    <br>In the hotel he started to think about what was said.
    <br>He was only thinking about what to eat and where to sleep.
    <br>While he was sleeping, he saw in the vision the woman he met long time ago.
    <br>The Lord showed him, "This is the woman we are talking about. Are you saying you don't know this woman?"
    <br>"I Slept With Her ONLY ONCE..." | TB Joshua PROPHECY!...
    <br>"Are you saying you don't know this woman?!"
    <br>He woke up and started thinking, "Yes! It is true. The woman said she was pregnant. That day."
    <br>He started calling friends, everyone - they said, "The woman has given a birth to a baby boy.
    <br>The boy is in the village.
    <br>He has no father".
    <br>That is how he came back and said, "I am very sorry. I remember now. Help me."
    <br>We said, "OK, in Jesus' name."
    <br>He was afraid to go to that place.
    <br>We said, "Go, nothing will happen to you."
    <br>On getting there, he entered the village; nobody knew him, until he looked for the woman he slept with.
    <br>The woman had married with somebody and has other babies.
    <br>The woman came and said, "Yes, I know this man. He slept with me. He is the one."
    <br>"I Slept With Her ONLY ONCE..." | TB Joshua PROPHECY!
    <br>Tell me - this is beyond human what?
    <br>[Comprehension.]
    <br>I didn’t know the girl.
    <br>I just met the girl once at my friend’s house and made love with that girl only once.
    <br>"I Slept With Her ONLY ONCE..." | TB Joshua PROPHECY!
    <br>Look, my brother, when you look at your life, from the beginning to the present, you will know that
    <br>those things that give you headache and problems, they are "only once".
    <br>Only once.
    <br>But just one slap like this is an abuse - you enter trouble.
    <br>Just, "I will deal with you" - only once.
    <br>Many are in the graveyard because of "only once".
    <br>Anytime a thief is caught and you move close to the thief and ask him, "Are you a robber?"
    <br>"Yes. Only once."
    <br>Those who have been robbing for many years - they never catch them.
    <br>"Only once."
    <br>If they are being shot, and they did not die, and you ask the person in the pool of blood, "What led you to rob?"
    <br>"It was only once."
    <br>I met the girl only once.
    <br>Then, I travelled to Cameroon.
    <br>Two months later, my brother called me on the phone.
    <br>He said that girl was pregnant.
    <br>I said, “Whether she’s pregnant is not my business. What is my concern?”
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>He is now confessing that he knew there was something like that.
    <br>Therefore, we are here together with the little boy, his mother and the younger brother of that girl.
    <br>That is the little boy.
    <br>Can you see his face and that man's face?
    <br>Mr. Only Once.
    <br>That is the man and the little boy.
    <br>You can see the resemblance.
    <br>Mr. Only Once.
    <br>Look at these two faces.
    <br>Now, what next?
    <br>Whatever this man lays hand on, he should go to the village
    <br>and pay all the money they have spent on this small child.
    <br>He should give them some huge money to thank them.
    <br>Now, take this child to a good school, and bring the child to himself
    <br>and whatever he lays his hands on, the road that was closed will open.
    <br>"I Slept With Her ONLY ONCE..." | TB Joshua PROPHECY!
    <br>Go to the village, pay the money.
    <br>All the care and love they have given to this boy...
    <br>Go and see the elders, not only the mother and say you are sorry.
    <br>You cannot pay them once.
    <br>You need to continue to go there and thank them.
    <br>It is not something you can just go...
    <br>Even trillion dollars cannot pay for that care and love.
    <br>You have to go there every time - no matter how much you give them,
    <br>you need to be going there to see how they are doing.
    <br>Carry this child, put him in a good school, let him be with you, be a father.
    <br>God wants to revise all the curses on you, the road that is blocked will be open.
    <br>My name is Esther Ezegbo.
    <br>I didn’t know this man before.
    <br>When your daughter, the mother of the child, saw him, what did she say?
    <br>My daughter said that this man had this child.
    <br>Let's hear the little boy.
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>Thank you, mamma.
    <br>I will sit with you people, we will discuss - so thank you very much.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Mamma, I will see you.
    <br>Thank you.
