  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Yes, give me your heart.
    <br>We are overwhelmed by many things.
    <br>We are overwhelmed by many distractions.
    <br>Jesus needs your heart.
    <br>That is a place of contact.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Jesus needs your heart.
    <br>That is a place of what? - Contact.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, free our heart to follow You.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, free our heart to follow You.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, free our heart to follow You.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, free my spirit to follow You.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Oh Holy Spirit, free my spirit to follow You.
    <br>The message is going to terminate every spiritual weakness.
    <br>It's going to be terminated today.
    <br>Every spiritual weakness in you will be terminated.
    <br>It's a prayer language.
    <br>While I'm talking to you, while you're looking at me and I'm looking at you,
    <br>keep saying in your spirit, "Oh Holy Spirit, free my spirit to follow You".
    <br>Many spirits are in bondage - bondage of unforgiveness,
    <br>bondage of anger, bondage of hatred, bondage of bitterness - just name it.
    <br>Bondage.
    <br>To all the hearts that are in bondage - listen:"Oh Holy Spirit, free my spirit to follow You".
    <br>Are you busy with that?
    <br>You can be saying it repeatedly until it becomes a reality to you.
    <br>Come on!
    <br>That is the easiest way to invite Jesus into your heart.
    <br>Free my spirit to follow You.
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>No turning back
    <br>I have decided to follow Jesus
    <br>No turning back
    <br>I would want to take you to the book of 2 Peter.
    <br>Whilst you are opening 2 Peter, that should not stop you from your meditation.
    <br>Your meditation should continue.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>2 Peter 1.
    <br>We take our reading from verse 1.
    <br>"Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,
    <br>to those who through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ
    <br>have received a faith as precious as ours:"
    <br>Verse 2.
    <br>"Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God
    <br>and of our Lord Jesus Christ."
    <br>Verse 3.
    <br>"...His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge
    <br>of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness."
    <br>Let's go to our proof text.
    <br>Verse 20.
    <br>"Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of scripture came about
    <br>by the prophet's own interpretation of things."
    <br>Verse 21.
    <br>"For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human..."
    <br>Listen to that - "prophets, though human".
    <br>T.B. Joshua is human.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua is divine.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Everyone has two natures in one person.
    <br>"...prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."
    <br>I want to take you up today on our standard for life.
    <br>As Christians, this is our standard for life.
    <br>This is my standard for life.
    <br>This is your standard for life.
    <br>So, because the way we go about the Bible,
    <br>we don't know the difference between the Bible and other books,
    <br>the difference between the Bible and history,
    <br>the difference between the Bible and chemistry or literature.
    <br>We don't know the difference; we just believe we must read it just like any other book.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The Bible and the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Read the Bible, read the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It means, the Bible itself is the letter inspired by the Spirit of God.
    <br>When you are reading the Bible, you are reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>As the Lord breathed His Spirit into certain men, so He breathed His Spirit into certain books.
    <br>Holy men were carried along by the Spirit of God as they spoke the message that came from God.
    <br>Holy men were carried along by the Spirit.
    <br>It means, they were carried along by the Spirit - without the Spirit, they cannot...
    <br>They were carried along by the Spirit as they spoke the message that came from God.
    <br>God speaks to us through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>He walks to us by His Word, through His Spirit.
    <br>He calls you through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>He whispers to you through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>He greets you and you greet Him.
    <br>You speak to Him and He speaks to you through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>Holy men were carried along by the Spirit as they spoke the Word that came from God.
    <br>If you must read the Bible, you must be carried along by the Spirit.
    <br>If you must teach the Bible, you must be carried along by the Spirit.
    <br>If you must preach the Word of God, you must be carried along by the Spirit
    <br>because God's Word refreshes our mind and God's Spirit renews our strength.
    <br>If you must teach the Word, you must teach the Word by the Spirit.
    <br>If you must call the name, "Jesus!" - through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>"Be healed!" - through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>"Hallelujah!" - through His Word, by His Spirit.
    <br>"Hallelujah!" or whatever word in His presence
    <br>because God is Spirit and His worshippers must do so in Spirit and in truth.
    <br>Nowadays, we read the Bible, we pray and the Bible says we don't know how to pray
    <br>but the Spirit is helping our weakness.
    <br>We pray, we read without any regard of or attention to the Spirit of God.
    <br>We pray and read the Bible without any attention or regard for the Spirit of God.
    <br>We do not place Him where He rightly belongs,
    <br>knowing how important He is to us and God.
    <br>That is the Spirit of God.
    <br>We do not place the Spirit of God where He rightly belongs.
    <br>Your spirit needs to be free.
    <br>Free my spirit to follow You.
    <br>Please, don't forget that.
    <br>If your spirit is not free and you are hearing me, you only hear me to preach the Word,
    <br>to teach the Word but not to live it.
    <br>You cannot live by it because the spirit is not free.
    <br>Your spirit must act upon the Word to be part of the Word.
    <br>Free my spirit to follow You.
    <br>How can one be reading the Bible without seeking the attention of the Holy Spirit?
    <br>What are you reading?
    <br>You are not reading the Bible; you are reading history.
    <br>Reading history is reading about events -
    <br>what happened, in Jerusalem, Jeremiah, Jesus Christ.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is the most sensitive of beings
    <br>and is easily hurt by lack of attention and regard.
    <br>When you pick the Bible without seeking His attention, what are you reading?
    <br>Before reading the Bible, we need to seek the attention of the Holy Spirit
    <br>because the Bible is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>What is tool? - The Word of God.
    <br>Before reading the Bible, you need to seek the attention of who?
    <br>- The Holy Spirit.
    <br>Because the Bible itself, I mean, the Word of God itself is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You cannot use it without the Holy Spirit.
    <br>It's a weapon and instrument in His hand.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is a Communicator.
    <br>When you open the Book of Romans 9:1, our conscience is the communication point.
    <br>The Holy Spirit is a Communicator and our heart is a contact point.
    <br>I mean, our heart is a communication point.
    <br>He cannot share with a heart full of bitterness.
    <br>He cannot share with a heart full of unforgiveness.
    <br>He cannot share with a heart full of hatred,
    <br>bad feelings towards others, your neighbour - the Holy Spirit cannot share with such a heart.
    <br>Can you see where your challenges and problems are coming from?
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The Holy Spirit cannot share with a heart full of hatred, unforgiveness,
    <br>bitterness, envy, jealousy - the Holy Spirit cannot share with such a heart.
    <br>Can you see the reason why you cannot invite the Holy Spirit to your heart?
    <br>To all the hearts that are in bondage - be free!
    <br>Bondage of unforgiveness - be free!
    <br>Bondage of envy, jealousy - be free!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Without the freedom, liberty of your heart, you are just wasting your time;
    <br>you are calling the god you do not know.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>If you hold grudges towards your neighbour,
    <br>you should not be surprised if the Bible has no meaning to you.
    <br>You can read your Bible hundred times.
    <br>As long as you hold grudges against anyone -
    <br>I mean bad feelings towards others, your neighbour - the Bible has no meaning to you.
    <br>Can you see the Bible you are carrying?
    <br>It is such a sensitive of being.
    <br>Such a sensitive of what? - Being.
    <br>Very sensitive.
    <br>Because it is the book of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Reading the Bible, reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Easily hurt by lack of attention and regard.
    <br>Without the Bible, what else again? How will you talk to God? How will you have access to God?
    <br>Without the Bible...
    <br>It is our standard.
    <br>Let's ask ourselves a question.
    <br>Why does the Bible not come alive to some of us nowadays?
    <br>Can somebody answer the question?
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Because we don't know the importance of the Bible,
    <br>we always read the Bible with burdens, grudges, hatred.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Did you listen to that? Simple.
    <br>The Bible can no longer come alive because we read the Bible with so much unforgiveness,
    <br>envy and jealousy.
    <br>The Bible no longer comes alive because of the unforgiveness.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The Bible can no longer come alive because of the unforgiveness we hold,
    <br>bitterness, envy and jealousy.
    <br>We read with so much unforgiving spirit.
    <br>Where are we going from here?
    <br>Where there is no Bible, there is no Christianity.
    <br>Where there is no Bible, there is no believer.
    <br>Where there is no Bible, there is no born-again.
    <br>We are trapped now.
    <br>How do we get out of this captivity?
    <br>Advice.
    <br>Read the Bible as often as possible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Read the Bible as often as possible.
    <br>Keep meditating on it until it becomes reailty to you.
    <br>Meditating, meditating.
    <br>You may not get it at first when you read.
    <br>You may not understand it at first when you read.
    <br>That is why you have to continue to meditate on it until it becomes reality.
    <br>You may not get it the first time you read; keep meditating.
    <br>Read it slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>Your understanding of what you read may not be the understanding of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>You need the attention of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>That is why you read slowly, attentively and repeatedly.
    <br>Even though our reason may reject it, let our heart crave for it.
    <br>Do you know one thing?
    <br>Finally.
    <br>The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient
    <br>but He does not necessarily reward good people, smart people like we are.
    <br>We are very good, smart in reading the Bible.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward good people, smart people, clever people, wealthy people;
    <br>He rewards obedient people.
    <br>The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward smart people, clever people, good people, wealthy people.
    <br>You know, we are very smart, very good, very clever, wealthy.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward them.
    <br>He rewards obedient people.
    <br>Trust and obey.
    <br>When we walk with the Lord
    <br>In the light of His Word
    <br>What a glory He sheds on our way
    <br>While we do His good will
    <br>He abides with us still
    <br>And with all who will trust and obey
    <br>Trust and obey
    <br>For there's no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>But to trust and obey
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward good people like you.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward smart people like you.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward a clever person like you.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward wealthy people like you.
    <br>He rewards obedient people.
    <br>Final advice.
    <br>The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward good people, brilliant people,
    <br>smart people, clever people, wealthy people.
    <br>Just talk - just name any adjective.
    <br>But He rewards obedient people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That is why fishermen were among his disciples.
    <br>Rustic people followed Him.
    <br>And you know what it took Paul to succeed - to become what he was.
    <br>So, when we are reading the Bible, put your knowledge aside.
    <br>There's a difference between supernatural and human natural gifts.
    <br>And we all know those things that follow human natural gifts -
    <br>talent, gift and education are under human natural gifts.
    <br>That is why people like me can be here.
    <br>If the reward was for the good, smart, clever, brilliant, I would not be in the position I am today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>The Holy Spirit always rewards the obedient.
    <br>He does not necessarily reward good people, clever people, smart people,
    <br>brilliant people, wealthy people.
    <br>He rewards the obedient.
    <br>Trust and obey.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't forget your prayer.
    <br>Free me to follow You; I have decided!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You raise me up
    <br>You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    <br>I am strong when I am on your shoulders
    <br>You raise me up to more than I can be
    <br>When I am down and oh my soul so weary
    <br>When troubles come and my heart burdened be
    <br>When I am still and wait here in the silence
    <br>Until You come and stay awhile with me
    <br>You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    <br>I am strong when I am on your shoulders
    <br>You raise me up to more than I can be
    <br>You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
    <br>You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
    <br>I am strong when I am on your shoulders
    <br>You raise me up to more than I can be
    <br>Right now, whatever root of bitterness or unforgiveness that keeps unforgiveness alive -
    <br>be moved, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That root that keeps unforgiveness alive - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That root that keeps bitterness alive in you - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That root that keeps envy, bitterness, sin alive - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>There is a root for all this.
    <br>There could be disagreement or whatever.
    <br>That root that keeps them alive - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You keep saying, "No, no, I don't need to hold offence".
    <br>But before you know it, you hold offence.
    <br>There's a root.
    <br>It may be through help that someone is giving you.
    <br>It may be where you live.
    <br>That root that keeps them alive - be terminated, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>That root!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That root!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That root!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Overflow Congregation
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
