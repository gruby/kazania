  <p>    
    <br>Those of you that have the Anointing Water, I want to minister it to you
    <br>to let you know what you are having.
    <br>Can you open it?
    <br>Raise it up, and stand up.
    <br>Blessed be the name of the Lord
    <br>He is worthy to be praised and adored
    <br>So we lift up holy hands in one accord
    <br>Singing blessed be the name
    <br>of the Lord.
    <br>You just stretch it forward for the
    <br>benefit of those who do not have the Anointing Water.
    <br>Whether you have it or not, all I know, once you spray it on the air now,
    <br>whether it fall on your clothes or body, it will catch fire.
    <br>Shout, Jesus!
    <br>Spray it in the air.
    <br>See what is happening.
    <br>People are falling one after another.
    <br>The anointing of God is flowing right now, see what is happening.
    <br>As he led them in prayer, and they began to spray the Anointing Water,
    <br>the mighty power of God fished out all the unclean spirits in their midst.
    <br>Say, In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Open your lips and spray it into your mouth.
    <br>Drink!
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Whatever unclean spirit!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Whatever that causes you failure!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Whatever that causes you sickness!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Whatever causes you hardship!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Whatever that causes you barrenness!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Whatever that causes you nightmares!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>Face your neighbour and begin to command whatever sickness and spray it on your neighbour.
    <br>Command whatever sickness and disease. Prayer!
    <br>As they sprayed the Anointing Water towards their neighbours, many began to manifest
    <br>and shake uncontrollably. Truly God is at work.
    <br>Where the light of God is, darkness has no hiding place.
    <br>As the evil spirits within them tried to escape, the power of God operating through the Anointing Water,
    <br>many rolled back and forth, others trembled.
    <br>Someone has coughed out this blood substance which was the root cause of their affliction.
    <br>The name of Jesus Christ is power and fire which makes satan and his agents tremble and flee.
    <br>Watch your screen and see what is happening.
    <br>See what is happening as they are spraying the Anointing Water.
    <br>Watch the screen of your television set and see what is happening in the midst of the people.
    <br>See an armed robber.
    <br>Watch your screen and see what is happening.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>I'm an armed robber and a cultist.
    <br>I took a blood oath.
    <br>You are what?
    <br>I'm an armed robber and a cultist.
    <br>As the prayer continues, this man who is an armed robber and a cultist is fished out.
    <br>And the evil spirit within him is forced to confess.
    <br>Spray the Anointing Water and see.
    <br>Watch your screen!
    <br>The brother says he is an armed robber and a cultist.
    <br>The man of God instructed people among the congregation to spray the Anointing Water
    <br>towards the man who confessed to be an armed robber and cultist.
    <br>Unable to stand the mighty power of God, he rolled back and forth on the floor.
    <br>Feeling uneasy due to the fire of the Holy Ghost, he began to pull off his clothes.
    <br>The fire is clearly too much for him, and he tried with all of his might to put out the invisible flames.
    <br>Who has Anointing Water?  Ok, come here!
    <br>Tell him to stand up and answer.
    <br>Stand up and answer, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Look! Tell him to do like this.
    <br>Jump up, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>At the instruction of the man of God, he commanded the exposed armed robber and cultist
    <br>to jump in the name of Jesus Christ; and the man was forced to jump.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, I command you to jump and talk.
    <br>You can see. These are the people terrorising us out there.
    <br>He said that he is an armed robber and cultist. You can see what the power of God can do.
    <br>Ask him to stand up again.
    <br>Stand up, in the name of Jesus! I command you to stand up in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Tell him to jump!
    <br>Stand up!
    <br>He shall jump up!
    <br>Put your hand on your ear and jump up! In the mighty name of Jesus, jump!
    <br>Jump, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Amen!
    <br>It's alright.
    <br>Tell him to go and sit down.
    <br>Come back!
    <br>Come back, in the name of Jesus.  I command you to come back, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Tell him to sit down.
    <br>Sit down on the floor, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>My name is Christian, and I am 25 years old.
    <br>I am a cultist and also an armed robber.
    <br>In 2008, when I travelled outside the country, I was deported.
    <br>It left me with nothing, causing me to roam about in the streets.
    <br>I started smoking Indian hemp and moving with bad guys.
    <br>What really motivated me to join the cult is the way they lavish money.
    <br>They can eat a hundred thousand naira at a go.
    <br>I asked my friend to put me through so that I would belong to the cult.
    <br>He asked me if I was willing to keep to the rules. I told him that I was willing to do anything.
    <br>He then told me to come back and see him in 3 days. I called him
    <br>and he said he was going to take me to our leader.
    <br>After two weeks, they called me and I went to see them.
    <br>They took me to the forest and asked me to take off my clothes, which I did.
    <br>They told me to raise my hands. They tied my hands and asked me to lie down.
    <br>There were 10 of them and they lashed me 25 strokes of machete drilling.
    <br>They also used a razor blade to cut my left hand.
    <br>Then they asked me to take my blood and keep whatever we did there a secret.
    <br>I promised that I would keep everything a secret.
    <br>After one week, they called and said that there was a mission for us.
    <br>They brought out arms,
    <br>cutlasses and axes.
    <br>They gave me one tool to carry out
    <br>the mission with them.
    <br>Then we went and it was successful and we came back
    <br>After three days they called me
    <br>for another mission.
    <br>On our way, the police took us unawares.
    <br>They shot two of our guys who were instantly dead.
    <br>I went to a herbalist for charms so that the bullets would not penetrate my body.
    <br>The herbalist did it for me.
    <br>They called us again for another mission,
    <br>in which we lost three souls.
    <br>Six of us were left alive.
    <br>I have charms in my body which I use
    <br>for operations.
    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>This is Christian, the armed robber and cultist who is now receiving deliverance
    <br>in the power of the Holy Spirit, after he has given his confession.
    <br>You are delivered, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Hallelujah!
