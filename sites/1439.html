  <p>    
    <br>The right hand of God is powerful and mighty.
    <br>As the ministers of God set out to pray for the people, as instructed by the Holy Spirit,
    <br>during The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations Sunday service,
    <br>the lightning of God's power in them dispels every shade of darkness in the lives of the people
    <br>as they touch them one after the other.
    <br>Remember, God Almighty reveals to redeem.
    <br>And as the ministers move in the midst of the congregation,
    <br>they share God's message to His people through the words of prophecy, healing and deliverance.
    <br>Let's watch how this young man is being set free
    <br>from the captivity of satan that has held him in bondage for many years, through the word of prophecy.
    <br>Can I talk to you?
    <br>I can see strange activities.
    <br>I am not saying it's something you did this morning.
    <br>When we are praying for you, we are going deep down to see the root cause of your problem.
    <br>It's not something you did today that we are talking about;
    <br>it's something you did a long time ago
    <br>And that is causing hindrances on your way.
    <br>You want to move forward but something keeps pulling you back.
    <br>I see strange activities.
    <br>You have to go and confess it.
    <br>Blood - on this hand.
    <br>When I say blood, I am not saying you killed somebody but I can see strange activities
    <br>that have taken so many lives - drugs.
    <br>Yes, it's true.
    <br>This is my son.
    <br>He is someone that has a lot of potential but
    <br>has also struggled with drug addiction and that lifestyle for 13 years.
    <br>We thank God for his freedom today!
    <br>We thank God he was delivered today!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Aaron Collins; I am 26 years old and I am from the USA.
    <br>The person standing next to me is my father.
    <br>For me, it goes back to starting at the age of 13, when I first opened up the door to addiction.
    <br>It started with marijuana.
    <br>It would be occasionally, when I would hang out with friends and
    <br>when I would visit certain cousins that I hadn't seen in a few years.
    <br>And then as the years went by, about three years later, I turned 16.
    <br>In 2008, I lost my grandfather, and when I went to his funeral in Florida, I was staying at his house.
    <br>He had many prescription medication pills, a lot of painkillers.
    <br>You could tell he didn't really take them because he had so many.
    <br>I stole everything, every single one of them.
    <br>How was I aware of what they were?
    <br>It came from the music I was listening to.
    <br>in America, rap music glorifies drug use.
    <br>Selling drugs is glorified.
    <br>So, I already knew what the pills were.
    <br>I took every one of them.
    <br>I smuggled them right back into the state where I was going.
    <br>I took them onto the airplane with me, I took them back home,
    <br>and that was when the pain medication use started.
    <br>For many years I used these prescription drugs; I even graduated to using cough syrup.
    <br>At the age of 18, I moved out of my father's house.
    <br>I went out on my own and my lifestyle of sin went to another level.
    <br>I was using these prescription drugs on a daily basis, depending on them, needing them.
    <br>Yes, I had a job; my father owned several businesses and he blessed me with my own branch in the business
    <br>where I was able to work for myself and make money to provide and pay my bills.
    <br>I had a home and things like that.
    <br>I began to sell heroin and marijuana.
    <br>I know about three people that lost their lives due to the heroin that I sold them.
    <br>So that's the blood on my hands that the woman of God was talking about.
    <br>So for years, I was dealing with this addiction.
    <br>I was selling drugs for about three years.
    <br>I turned 21 years old and I had my daughter.
    <br>Shortly after my daughter was born, a few months after she was born,
    <br>I was unable to get my hands on these prescription drugs that I had been dependent on for so many years.
    <br>Then somebody that I loved and trusted - my daughter's mom -
    <br>told me that this drug she had been selling was a painkiller,
    <br>just like the ones I was taking but even stronger.
    <br>She was talking about heroin.
    <br>So, at age 21, almost 22, I began to do heroin.
    <br>For years, I walked through life blinded, broken and burdened by addiction.
    <br>I would hopelessly and helplessly wonder, "why me?"
    <br>It seemed like these addictions and afflictions happened overnight.
    <br>With the lifestyle of addiction, you have no concept of time at all.
    <br>Five years may seem like one year.
    <br>That was the devil's way of blinding me as he was binding me.
    <br>In 2016, from injecting this drug, I had an abscess that grew on my arm
    <br>due to intravenous drug use and I had to go through an emergency surgery.
    <br>After my surgery, before I got released from the hospital,
    <br>my father came to the hospital and he told me that he wanted me to leave everything behind.
    <br>He wanted me to move back into his house with my daughter so I could begin to make a change
    <br>because he saw me slowly driving myself into the ground over the years.
    <br>So I agreed and, about a week later, my daughter and I had already moved into my father's house
    <br>and about a week later, I gave my car to my daughter's mom.
    <br>She was my girlfriend at the time; I gave my car to her and trusted it to her.
    <br>I gave her the keys knowing she did not have a licence, that her licence had been suspended,
    <br>knowing that she was in this drug lifestyle as well, knowing that she was high.
    <br>And that night, a young man was thrown into eternity.
    <br>That night she fell asleep behind the wheel and the man that was in the car with her in the back seat,
    <br>he flew through the windshield and died from the impact.
    <br>So that confirms the 'blood on my hands' prophecy that I received from the woman of God.
    <br>At that time I was about 23 or 24.
    <br>I had been in rehab after rehab after rehab; I could never pull it together.
    <br>I had overdosed maybe five times, maybe even more.
    <br>There were times where the ambulance had to come out to the site and revive me because I was dead.
    <br>I remember one time, in particular, I had been sober for about a month or so, but then I decided to get high.
    <br>I went into the bathroom, locked the door, got loaded, got high.
    <br>Somehow, in some way, my daughter got into the bathroom and saw me
    <br>and she was able to get my mother's attention.
    <br>And my mother came in.
    <br>She gave me CPR for about 20 minutes until the ambulance arrived to revive me.
    <br>Over the years in this lifestyle of addiction,
    <br>it will take you down a path that you would never dream you would go down.
    <br>You will do things you never dreamed that you would ever do.
    <br>I've stolen from my father, stolen from my mother, my brother, my sister, and my grandma.
    <br>I've hurt many people in the process of living this lifestyle of addiction.
    <br>In 2017, February, I was on felony probation for seven years.
    <br>I stopped reporting to my probation officer.
    <br>I left the state of Ohio in the United States.
    <br>I was not supposed to leave the state but I left.
    <br>But when I came back, my father picked me up from the bus station,
    <br>and I thought we were going home, but he turned me in to law enforcement.
    <br>I ended up in prison for about four months.
    <br>When I was done serving my sentence, I was released.
    <br>When I got out, I was feeling good about myself.
    <br>I felt assured that I would overcome this thing and I would stay clean and sober.
    <br>And when I got out, I found out that my baby sister had died while I was incarcerated.
    <br>She died on Mother's Day.
    <br>I got out about three or four days before her funeral.
    <br>I held it together for about two to three days,
    <br>and then the morning of her funeral, I got loaded; I got high at her funeral.
    <br>I just couldn't take it, I was out of my body, I was trying to escape reality.
    <br>I was falling asleep at her funeral.
    <br>You could tell that I was high, you could tell that I was under the influence; I had relapsed.
    <br>I could never just pull it together.
    <br>I would go a couple months,
    <br>I would be fine and sober and then I would fall right back into addiction again.
    <br>I just got out of rehab last year.
    <br>I got out in October and I was clean and sober for about two months.
    <br>Then from January 1st of 2019, this year, I began to get high again.
    <br>On one particular day, after I got high, several hours later, I began to cook dinner for my daughter.
    <br>And after I cooked dinner for her, I had a thought in my head:
    <br>When I'm done, after I serve her meal, I'm going to go upstairs and I'm going to get high
    <br>and as I was walking away, she looked at me and said "Dad, what are you doing?"
    <br>She was saying, "Open your eyes, dad!"
    <br>And I knew it wasn't her, I knew it was God speaking through her.
    <br>I knew she was just an instrument.
    <br>God was speaking through her, telling me to stop what I was doing and to open my eyes.
    <br>As of then, how old was she?
    <br>Almost 5; she was 2 days away from turning five years old.
    <br>For many years my father has been connected with this ministry.
    <br>He tried to get me down to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations for many years.
    <br>And I would never go; I did not want to come.
    <br>For how many years did he try to bring you here, although it seemed futile?
    <br>A little over 7 years.
    <br>He had been praying and trying to get me to come here to SCOAN and I would not agree to come.
    <br>And I often asked myself, because my daughter found me overdosed on the floor twice,
    <br>and both times she went and got me help; I often asked God.
    <br>In America, heroin is the number one epidemic.
    <br>It is easier to find heroin than it is to find marijuana ; it's everywhere.
    <br>In America, within a month you get hundreds of overdoses,
    <br>within a month, hundreds of people die from heroin overdoses.
    <br>And the state that I live in, last year, they labeled it as the heroin headquarters
    <br>out of all the 50 states of America.
    <br>And I often asked myself why God had so much mercy and grace on my life.
    <br>"Why am I still here, time after time after time, chance after chance after chance?"
    <br>That is not enough for Jesus Christ, put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>I just felt like my time was running out.
    <br>I felt like God had given me so many chances and when I asked Him why I was so fortunate to still be here,
    <br>I felt Him speak to me and say, "When you were a child, you were in ministry."
    <br>I had been in ministry with my dad ever since the age of 8.
    <br>I remember times as a kid when my dad would make me fast and pray.
    <br>It was the whole foundation of why I was still alive.
    <br>There were all the people that we helped.
    <br>At the age of 13, we were ministering to over a half a million teens a year.
    <br>I was doing music with them, but as I got into addiction,
    <br>the devil stole my dreams, my talents, my abilities.
    <br>He stole everything from me.
    <br>He stripped everything from me.
    <br>So, I felt like my time was running out.
    <br>My dad said, "You need to go to the SCOAN, to get a major deliverance"
    <br>and I just felt like my time was coming to an end.
    <br>That is why I decided to come here.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Tell us, what happened last Sunday?
    <br>I arrived four days before my first service.
    <br>Day by day, I felt like God was removing layers off me.
    <br>But when I got touched on Sunday, I felt a burden lifted off me that I have never felt before.
    <br>I had been in rehab after rehab.
    <br>I had been trying and trying for years to get set free, but I have never felt freer in my entire life -
    <br>from the moment when I was touched and the woman of God put her hands on me.
    <br>I just felt this burden, this bondage, that lifted off me.
    <br>As I said, I have never felt more free in my life.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ
    <br>Tell us the changes you have seen after that Sunday when the woman of God touched you
    <br>and gave you that life-changing prophecy.
    <br>I have been way more focused.
    <br>I haven't had any cravings, in any way, shape or form.
    <br>I haven't had any withdrawal symptoms.
    <br>I have been seeking God's face like never before.
    <br>Before I got here, you could not pay me to pray!
    <br>But I've been praying for hours and hours and seeking God's face.
    <br>What word of advice do you have for youth all over the world
    <br>and for those who are listening to you?
    <br>I would say it starts with the fundamentals.
    <br>I would say it starts with listening to your parents.
    <br>If you don't have parents, listen to that loved one - aunt, uncle or mentor - 
    <br>whoever it is in your life that wants to see you prosper, listen to them.
    <br>The ones who are living as an example of how you should live the right way, listen to them.
    <br>Don't go astray and don't start experimenting with drugs.
    <br>It starts with tobacco or marijuana, but that is opening up the door to addiction.
    <br>Do not even start experimenting.
    <br>Be careful what you watch, be careful what you listen to - be careful of what entertains you -
    <br>because for a lot of people I know in America, what entertains over 90% of them is the music.
    <br>So I would say be careful what you listen to because the music has a message
    <br>and if you listen to that message long enough, it will become a lifestyle.
    <br>On this road of addiction, you will do things you never even dreamed you would do.
    <br>You will hurt people that you truly love in your heart
    <br>but you are blinded at the time and you have no feelings at all.
    <br>You hurt many people that you love.
    <br>So I will say don't even start with that first drug.
    <br>Don't do it.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ for that wonderful piece of advice.
    <br>As we all know, experience is the best teacher
    <br>and he is in the best position to render this wonderful piece of advice.
    <br>You heard it all; I'll just pick one word from his advice.
    <br>He says drug addiction will make you lose your senses and will make you hurt those you love so much.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>Finally, based on the fact that God has used a wonderful father by your side to bring you closer to Jesus,
    <br>what do you have to say to your dad?
    <br>Thank you for not giving up on me.
    <br>There were times where I went more than six months without even speaking to my dad and mom.
    <br>I would not be in contact with them, but they never gave up on me.
    <br>I've stolen so much from them.
    <br>I've hurt them so much, but they never gave up on me.
    <br>I just want to say I am sorry for everything that I have ever done,
    <br>and I also want to look into the camera to my mom who may be watching in America right now.
    <br>I don't know, but I want to say I'm sorry for everything that I stole from you.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation/Deliverance Testimony
    <br>That's not enough for Jesus Christ, put your hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God.
    <br>My name is LG Wise from the USA.
    <br>First of all, I'd just like to say, brethren, Emmanuel!
    <br>Hallelujah, today is a great day.
    <br>Today is a glorious day.
    <br>I thank God, first of all, for the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>for just preparing a place where we could come and get help when we cannot help ourselves,
    <br>preparing a place where we could bring our loved ones when we can't even help them.
    <br>I'd just like to thank the man of God.
    <br>And I would also like to say to all the parents: Do not give up on your children.
    <br>If you don't fight for them, who will fight for them?
    <br>There were so many times I wanted to give up because I didn't have any more strength.
    <br>But I thank God.
    <br>I never stopped taking the anointing water and spraying it in his car.
    <br>I would take the anointing sticker and put it in his car
    <br>and I would stand with the man of God when he was praying for the families.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for everything; In fact, it calls for tears of joy!
    <br>I believe everyone in this auditorium is in the same shoes as him.
    <br>We rejoice with you greatly for this wonderful moment; it is indeed a wonderful moment -
    <br>a day you will live to remember and never forget in your life.
    <br>And we believe you have much to say.
    <br>I want to say again that in the times I wanted to give up on him,
    <br>I realised that God was saying, "I never gave up on you."
    <br>So, parents, don't take it lightly:
    <br>Go into your children's phones.
    <br>God gave you these children for a reason.
    <br>God gave you these people for a reason, to protect them, to lead them, to guide them.
    <br>Go into the phones, find out what they're doing.
    <br>Be there for them, fight for them.
    <br>But it's like the man of God said a few years ago:
    <br>Regardless how old your children are, we are in a time when they still need to sit at your feet.
    <br>They still need to learn from you.
    <br>They still need to be led by you.
    <br>Don't leave them by themselves because they are not ready to fight the enemy by themselves.
    <br>Because of what the man of God has done, because of what he has taught us...
    <br>Day after day, minute after minute, we didn't know if he was going to survive, thinking naturally,
    <br>because that drug addiction is day after day and you don't know if they're going to live or die, day after day.
    <br>But once again, we thank God for the faith items that he gave the man of God.
    <br>We thank God for the faith that was released through Emmanuel TV,
    <br>that when we didn't have the strength, we were able to be drawn to the strength.
    <br>Once again: Parents, do not give up on your children!
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Yes, we still want to hear from you briefly because we know this is a moment of joy.
    <br>In line with your statement, we want to pick out a point where you said that it got to a stage
    <br>that you almost gave up on him, but something told you: 'Keep going, don't give up, a day like this will come.'
    <br>Something must have led to that.
    <br>What were the terrible experiences you had with your son, when he was highly addicted to those drugs,
    <br>that made you almost give up then? Just share those experiences with us.
    <br>You get a child and you observe him; he was somebody that was very responsible,
    <br>he was very gifted, he could see someone doing something and he could learn that skill very quickly.
    <br>At the age of 12 or 13, he was a full engineer.
    <br>People were coming to the recording studio and I wasn't even able to record them,
    <br>but he knew exactly how to record them.
    <br>He pushed all the buttons; he told them what to do.
    <br>He was literally, at 12 and 13, he was a full recording studio engineer.
    <br>So, to see him stray away and get into drugs and to see how the devil took everything.
    <br>I saw the gifts and the talents and the abilities being stripped away and taken from him.
    <br>These things really discouraged us and we really felt like giving up
    <br>because I would come to my house at times and he had overdosed,
    <br>and it was by the grace of God that we were able to get him back.
    <br>The moment that he talked about, the day when his girlfriend at the time...
    <br>I had offered to take her to rehab and she agreed but when I got back to pick her up, she had fled.
    <br>So, I took my son and during that time, she had started driving.
    <br>She went out with some of the ones she was getting high with and she didn't just wreck the car,
    <br>it was on a very high overpass where she flipped the car and the car turned over and over and over.
    <br>She landed and it killed the passenger on the inside.
    <br>And I know that my son could have been with her.
    <br>By the grace of God, I had collected my son and had him to stay with me.
    <br>He hadn't been with me for - he said 6 months, but it really had been a few years.
    <br>Like he said, there's no concept of time when you're in addiction.
    <br>It had actually been about three years since he had really been with me.
    <br>Once again, I can't stress enough to say to the parents to keep praying, keep believing, keep standing.
    <br>The man of God is standing with you.
    <br>Keep tuned into Emmanuel TV
    <br>because I'm telling you that's where the strength came when we did not have strength.
    <br>At the times when I didn't have strength, my wife had the strength.
    <br>At the times that she didn't have the strength, I had the strength.
    <br>It's a battle; do not leave them alone; keep fighting for them.
    <br>As a father, can you tell us your own observation ever since he's been delivered?
    <br>Just like he said, he wasn't against the Bible, he wasn't against praying; he just couldn't do it.
    <br>What was on his life was preventing him from really praying and studying
    <br>but now that he's been here, he's been able to rest.
    <br>He's been with me on the prayer mountain
    <br>and I've seen him pray for six and seven hours on the prayer mountain, straight.
    <br>We know that that is nothing but the grace of God!
    <br>So now we see that he's totally free and once again, I'd just like to thank the man of God.
    <br>I'd just like to thank God for all that He's done because now my son is free.
    <br>I feel like the prodigal son is back.
    <br>We really love you.
    <br>Let's clap for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Thank you so much.
    <br>Finally, we thank God Almighty for what he has done in your life and also the life of your son.
    <br>It takes Jesus Christ to do that.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for accomplishing this work of deliverance in the life of your son.
    <br>We pray as you both go and continue to make the Word of God the standard for your lives,
    <br>always have it at the back of your mind that:
    <br>'Better is not good enough; the best is always yet to come!'
    <br>Shall we put our hands together beautifully for the miracle-working God?
