  <p>    
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God is with us, who can be against us?
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>Rise up.
    <br>Let's observe a minute silence in memory of the martyrs of faith.
    <br>Viewers all over the world.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I am here to relate some of the message the Lord has given me.
    <br>I want to read.
    <br>It is a few words but I want you to take note of this message.
    <br>It is a revelation for me from God.
    <br>Those who are affected in one way or the other
    <br>and those who passed on to glory,
    <br>their greatest desire is to see that the work of salvation
    <br>they died and suffered for continues
    <br>and for it to reach unreachable places.
    <br>That is their greatest desire.
    <br>I read again.
    <br>Those who are affected in one way or the other
    <br>and those who passed on to glory,
    <br>their greatest desire is to see that the work of salvation
    <br>they died and suffered for continues
    <br>and for it to reach unreachable places.
    <br>For that, what they are coming here for
    <br>should be taken to meet them in their country.
    <br>Once in a month, I will be travelling to South Africa.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>Once in a month, I will be travelling to South Africa
    <br>to meet people from South Africa
    <br>and other nations who find South Africa easier to visit.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>If their desire - their greatest desire is to see that the work of salvation
    <br>they died and suffered for continues and for it to reach unreachable places -
    <br>there are many people in South Africa who could not afford the ticket -
    <br>that is unreachable places - these are the areas we have not reached -
    <br>once in a month, I will be travelling to South Africa
    <br>to meet people from South Africa
    <br>and other nations who find South Africa easier to visit
    <br>in memory of the martyrs of faith.
    <br>So that South Africa will continue to remember what the martyrs of faith have achieved.
    <br>I know out of ten people coming to my nation,
    <br>at least six of them are coming to The SCOAN here.
    <br>I know it is a very painful thing -
    <br>my people will not receive it but this is a message from God.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>By statistics; out of 10 people, 6 are coming here, only 4 are going to other places.
    <br>I know how my people will feel but this is not my message.
    <br>If it was my message, I would preach it but it is a revelation from God.
    <br>I cannot afford to offend the saints if I want to be a saint.
    <br>I cannot afford to offend the martyrs if I want to be one.
    <br>I cannot afford to offend them.
    <br>It is a bone that I cannot share by myself.
    <br>My ministration in South Africa will not be on Sundays.
    <br>Listen to that.
    <br>I am not going there because of this or that or membership.
    <br>My ministration will not be on Sundays
    <br>so that people will have the opportunity to attend their respective churches.
    <br>At least, the martyrs of faith - they had various churches that they attended.
    <br>They came here for healing and deliverance and to increase their faith.
    <br>So, I should also go there to do the same thing.
    <br>Once again, my ministration in South Africa will not be on Sundays
    <br>so that people will have the opportunity to attend their respective churches.
    <br>This kind of faith expressed by South Africans
    <br>deserves this kind of blessing from God.
    <br>This kind of faith expressed by South Africans
    <br>deserves this kind of blessing from God.
    <br>It is a price I must pay.
    <br>Satan is a liar.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>It's a huge price.
    <br>Since last Sunday I went through the South Africans that have visited here - millions...
    <br>The ones we can account for - millions that have visited here.
    <br>As I'm talking now - up to 2 000 people send letters and want to come.
    <br>As people are listening to me now, they will hold on.
    <br>I am going to discuss with the government of South Africa because of the crowd.
    <br>It is not an issue I can achieve alone or any organisation can achieve;
    <br>only the government can do it because of mammoth crowds
    <br>that would attend my services there.
    <br>If I visited Colombia and I had so much, imagine if I visited South Africa -
    <br>where are they going to keep the crowd?
    <br>This is it.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>I know my country will understand the position of things.
    <br>If not the voice of God, I would not be able to come out to say this.
    <br>This is the voice of God.
    <br>South Africa, I mean Southern Africa, I love you with the love of God.
    <br>I have received so many emails and text messages
    <br>full of preaching, teaching and counselling.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>I have been your pastor, preaching to you;
    <br>now, it is your turn that you are preaching to me.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>I mean, it is your turn that you are giving back what you have received
    <br>in terms of preaching, teaching and counselling.
    <br>Thank you for understanding the time that I am in.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>There is a time to give and there is a time to receive.
    <br>There is a time to run and a time to slow awhile.
    <br>There is a time to laugh and a time to cry.
    <br>There is a time to be born and a time to die.
    <br>Thank you, once again for understanding the time that I am in.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>T.B. Joshua Coming To South Africa In Honour Of ‘Martyrs Of Faith'
    <br>It depends on the arrangements and the plan.
    <br>I'm saying a vision and I have to travel there and discuss.
    <br>Whatever day fits them, apart from Sunday, is OK.
    <br>So, Southern Africa, South Africa,
    <br>this is what our martyrs of faith brought to us
    <br>and I cannot afford to disobey because I want to be one in future.
    <br>My people, Nigeria,
    <br>I know the Lord will communicate understanding into our hearts
    <br>so that you will be able to see the way I am looking at it.
    <br>Thank you. God bless you.
