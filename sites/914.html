  <p>    
    <br>Here is Chinazo, attached to a breathing machine that she is dependent on for her ailment.
    <br>Displayed on the table in front of her is the medication she has to take daily.
    <br>Her mother cries out to the man of God, for God to locate her daughter.
    <br>Man of God, please, help my daughter! We are from South Africa.
    <br>She has got a problem in breathing because of asthma and allergic rhinitis.
    <br>She has been having this for four years.
    <br>Every time the weather changes, she gets a blockage in her chest and breathing.
    <br>She has to take medication every day. She cannot go out without taking medication.
    <br>Most of the time, she goes to casualty so that she can get oxygen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It has affected her in the way that every time she is sick, she can't go to school.
    <br>She cannot go out and visit because we need to make sure that we give her medication all the time.
    <br>When she goes out to visit, she can't sleep over.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering Prayer
    <br>And Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>My name is Chi Chi.
    <br>Oh, how are you?
    <br>I'm fine.
    <br>Jesus loves you so much.
    <br>Please, heal me! I've had enough of this medication.
    <br>I want to be healed, in Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Listen to what my little one says. You said what?
    <br>Please, heal me!
    <br>Jesus will heal you. He loves you so much.
    <br>He is concerned about you.
    <br>He is concerned about your health.
    <br>Jesus is concerned about your health - how you are doing.
    <br>He does not want you to have asthma.
    <br>He loves you so much.
    <br>Yes, I love Him too.
    <br>You love Him too?
    <br>Please, heal me! I am begging you, please, heal me!
    <br>I don't want this medication.
    <br>I want to be healed, in Jesus' name we have prayed.

    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>She said she wants to speak to me.
    <br>She doesn't want anybody to know.
    <br>So, I just said, "Ok".
    <br>I will not tell you because she said nobody should know.
    <br>So when I leave here, I will see you. I understand. Okay?
    <br>I will see you. Okay? Thank you.
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free, in the name of Jesus! Thank You!
    <br>Healed In Jesus' Name
    <br>I can breathe again, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>It is good to be in the presence of the Lord.
    <br>My name is Mbali Ibe.
    <br>This is my daughter Chinazo.
    <br>My older daughter and my darling husband Vitalis.
    <br>We came to The SCOAN because of the problem she was experiencing.
    <br>She had a problem of short breath, allergic rhinitis due to asthma.
    <br>It was so bad, in such a way that in many cases,
    <br>we would have to take her to casualty at least twice or three times a week.
    <br>When she went to school, she had to play in a certain area.
    <br>She couldn't play with everybody else because when she played
    <br>where there was dust or grass, it was a problem.
    <br>As a normal child, a child should be left to play and run anywhere they please to.
    <br>But with her, it was a different story.
    <br>She would play because you could not stop her from playing with other children.
    <br>But at the end of the day, it would be a problem.
    <br>When we gave her medication, it would relieve her for a while.
    <br>After that, we would have to take her to see a doctor or casualty.
    <br>They would always change medication for her; they would always give her different drugs.
    <br>They would always give her stronger medication.
    <br>But I give all the glory to God because today, she is no longer the same.
    <br>She is healed.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So, we saw the documentary and we can see all the table full of the medication and the machine.
    <br>Just to give us a clearer picture.
    <br>Tell us - how often did she use all these things?
    <br>The medication that you see here is half of what she took.
    <br>She had to take her medication every day - three times a day.
    <br>Seven days a week, three times a day.
    <br>If she missed one of the pumps, tablets or sirups, then she would not sleep that night.
    <br>So she could not live without taking medication
    <br>She was dependent on this medication.
    <br>When she went to school, you would have to make sure you did not forget to give her medication.
    <br>When she came back from school, you would make sure she took medication.
    <br>So she was basically dependent on this medication.
    <br>She could not do without medication before.
    <br>Wow. And without all of this, there was nothing else the doctors could do
    <br>about this condition of asthma and rhinitis?
    <br>We had been to different doctors and specialists.
    <br>They told us that asthma is not curable.
    <br>The only thing they could do for her is to treat it.
    <br>They would just give her treatment.
    <br>When she grew older, she might outgrow it.
    <br>They couldn't tell us when but they were not sure if she could outgrow it.
    <br>But they said, in many instances, children outgrow it when they are older.
    <br>So she was supposed to take this medication until that time came,
    <br>if it was going to come.
    <br>Wow. So you came here last week to The SCOAN
    <br>and we saw the touching clip of how the man of God prayed for your daughter and family.
    <br>Tell us - what happened and what has been happening since then?
    <br>When we came here on Sunday, by the grace of God, the man of God located us
    <br>and she was prayed for.
    <br>Since that day, we have never experienced any cough, shortage of breath
    <br>or anything like that that we used to experience before.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus, the King of Glory!
    <br>Louder and louder!
    <br>Miss Chinazo Ibe & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>So since then, she has not used the machine, any of the breathing equipment or any of the medication
    <br>that she previously had to use several times every day, is that right?
    <br>Yes, we have never touched that medication ever since that Sunday.
    <br>We have never used the machine.
    <br>And we are never going to use them ever again.
    <br>Amen! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Miss Chinazo Ibe & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>I think, as a mother, when your little one is sick or is experiencing such attacks,
    <br>in many cases, it is difficult for you to sleep.
    <br>It is difficult for you to ask people to take her for checkups.
    <br>It will affect the whole family because everything that depends on her health,
    <br>it has to be done by you or the father.
    <br>So, in many instances, you will find that instead of going to work or doing your business,
    <br>you cannot because you have to look after her
    <br>or take her for checkups as she has to see one specialist or the other.
    <br>She could not go to school. She had to stay home.
    <br>It is very painful to see your child living like that.
    <br>It is not a good feeling.
    <br>I thank God and give Him the glory that now, the situation has changed.
    <br>Financially, it will affect you.
    <br>You will feel it because if you buy one pump like this -
    <br>people who come from my country will know -
    <br>if you buy a pump like this because if you go to a private doctor,
    <br>they will give you a prescription and you will go and buy this medication on your own.
    <br>A pump like this is about 650 rands - that is for one pump.
    <br>Monthly, you would have to make a budget of about 2000 to 3000 rands for medication
    <br>because she could not stay without medication. You had to make sure she got the medication.
    <br>So we had to make a budget for it.
    <br>So it would affect you as you could not do certain things for them.
    <br>When it came to their school fees, you had to make sure you provided for her medication
    <br>and school fees but financially, it was a burden to us.
    <br>And ever since the man of God prayed for your daughter, tell us your testimony.
    <br>I'm overjoyed.
    <br>I don't know where to start because my scars have been turned into stars.
    <br>Since from that Sunday, I cannot express how I'm feeling.
    <br>If I could open my heart for you to know how joyful it is, how grateful we are,
    <br>how God has shown us that He is love, I'm grateful, I'm happy, I give all the glory to God.
    <br>With this testimony, I know that we will come back with bigger testimonies!
    <br>Amen! Put your hands together for Christ Jesus, the Miracle Worker!
    <br>Madam, before we move on, we would like to hear - we are so touched by your testimony -
    <br>what is your word of advice to people watching you around the world
    <br>whose daughter or child might go through a similar difficult sickness or hard problems?
    <br>My advice to everybody is:
    <br>Jesus Christ, by His resurrection, has shown us that He is worthy of our faith.
    <br>He has shown us that we can depend on Him and Him alone.
    <br>He has shown us that He wants to dwell in our hearts and be the Landlord of our hearts.
    <br>Because the prayers I have been praying, this one, when we came here to The SCOAN,
    <br>I said, "God, take more of me and give me more of You".
    <br>I thanked Him for her healing before we even stepped into this church
    <br>because I knew that once we got in here - this vicinity because this is the holy ground -
    <br>everything would be over.
    <br>Now, the problem that we have as Christians:
    <br>We want to believe that when the evangelist or the man of God did not see you,
    <br>you are not okay.
    <br>Believe before you even come inside this church that your problems are over.
    <br>Because God looks at your heart and surely, the man of God will locate you
    <br>when you open your heart with faith,
    <br>when you believe that you have received already.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus!" is a response from a happy heart.
    <br>Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Truly, who else is worthy of our applause, thanks, praise and lifetime.
    <br>It is none other than Jesus Christ, the King of Glory.
    <br>Now, we would like to hear a word from Chi Chi herself, now that she has received this miracle.
    <br>Our sister, tell us - what is your name and how old are you?
    <br>I'm five years old.
    <br>Wow. And what is your name?
    <br>Chinazo.
    <br>And where are you from?
    <br>From South Africa.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for her!
    <br>So, last week, we saw you telling Prophet T.B. Joshua something.
    <br>Can you tell us - what did you tell him?
    <br>I said, "Please, T.B. Joshua, heal me!
    <br>Please heal me!"
    <br>And what did you say about all this medication that you have been using?
    <br>I said, "I have enough of this medication.
    <br>Please heal me! I had enough of this medication.
    <br>Jesus Christus, please heal me! I forgive You. Amen".
    <br>Wow. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Can you tell us - how did you feel when you were discussing with the man of God
    <br>and when he prayed for you?
    <br>I was shaking but the man of God prayed for me and now I'm healed.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>So, if you were to see the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, now, physically,
    <br>what would you do and what would you say?
    <br>I'm no longer taking medication, I'm no longer coughing,
    <br>I'm no longer bleeding and I'm no longer sneezing.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for healing me!
    <br>Thank you!
    <br>Go on! Put your hands together and encourage her!
    <br>Hallelujah! We are listening to this wonderful testimony of Chi Chi
    <br>who came all the way from South Africa
    <br>who received prayer last week from Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and was healed from the problem of allergic rhinitis and asthma
    <br>which she had suffered from for the past four years.
    <br>We have seen the medication, the machines and what she had been dependent on.
    <br>Every day of her life, she had to use these things several times a day
    <br>in order just to survive. Otherwise, she would get shortness of breath,
    <br>she would be coughing and ultimately, her breathing would seize until she was treated
    <br>and even at times rushed to casualty, to the emergency rooms of hospitals to receive oxygen.
    <br>So she is here in our midst today and she is testifying
    <br>how God Almighty has completely healed her from this horrible problem in her life
    <br>and we thank God Almighty that she is here today - a living testimony for the glory of God.
    <br>We want to ask you a question now.
    <br>Can you tell us - if you were to see T.B. Joshua standing in front of you now,
    <br>what would you say to him and what would you do?
    <br>I would just say, "I'm no longer coughing! Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I'm no longer sneezing, I'm no longer bleeding,
    <br>I'm no longer taking medication!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So you are no longer taking medication, you are no longer coughing,
    <br>you can breathe fine, is that right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Wow. We would like you to demonstrate for us, for the people of God.
    <br>Can you show us how you can breathe strongly now?
    <br>I can breathe now.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>I love you, T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Miss Chinazo Ibe & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Since you were healed last week, tell us - what has this week been like?
    <br>How are you breathing now? Tell us the difference.
    <br>I sleep very well and no more coughing whilst I'm sleeping.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>She said that now she can sleep very well, she breathes easily,
    <br>she can run up and down and she doesn't get short of breath.
    <br>Who else can do it except Jesus Christ, the Miracle Worker!
    <br>Put your hands together for Him!
    <br>Wow. Thank you very much for saying your wonderful testimony in our midst.
    <br>We just want to ask you one last question.
    <br>Can you show us how you are feeling now.
    <br>Miss Chinazo Ibe & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>Are you happy now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Lastly, let us hear a word from the father
    <br>because we know he has joined them in going through this tough situation
    <br>as a parent to see this happening to your child
    <br>and we thank God Almighty for what the Lord has done in their lives.
    <br>Sir, you are welcome. Tell us your name and where you are from.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Good Morning, Church!
    <br>Our names are Mr and Mrs Ibe Vitalis.
    <br>The problem that brought us here to The SCOAN was inability to breathe well,
    <br>sometimes she bled and in the night she coughed too much.
    <br>This problem had been a burden to us as parents.
    <br>Since you came to The SCOAN last week and she received prayer,
    <br>can you tell us what has been happening with her at home? What are the differences?
    <br>It is beyond because since we came here...
    <br>For over four years, every night, every day, she must take her medication. It was a must!
    <br>But since we came here, it is amazing up-to-date!
    <br>At night, I wake up to look at her.
    <br>She sleeps as if ... it is beyond explaining!
    <br>She is okay! Perfectly! Everything is normal!
    <br>We thank Jesus for that.
    <br>Hallelujah! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So you mean, before, you would always be waking up in the night
    <br>to go and check on her, to see how she is doing?
    <br>Before, her cought would wake you up.
    <br>Her cough would wake us up.
    <br>And when the cough started - at times, even if it was 1 in the morning,
    <br>one of us would rush to hospital for oxygen.
    <br>We tried all these machines but it was still too much.
    <br>You would have to take her to (hospital). Sometimes, at night, the cough would wake us up.
    <br>But since the prayer of Prophet T.B. Joshua last week, have you had any experience like that?
    <br>Since last week, nothing like cough at night.
    <br>She sleeps, she plays.
    <br>Even peanuts - we didn't give her peanuts before
    <br>because when she ate peanuts, you were looking for a problem.
    <br>But now, she says, "Daddy, I want peanuts!"
    <br>I will buy and she will eat.
    <br>I will be looking at her with one eye but nothing - nothing like cough.
    <br>Hallelujah! God is good! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank you very much, sir. Lastly, what is your advice to people watching you all over the world?
    <br>My advice is this:
    <br>Parents, put your trust in God.
    <br>Whatever challenge your family is going through, know that God has the final say.
    <br>You must pray, you must fast.
    <br>Depend on God and hope on God.
    <br>At the right time, He will see you through.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ once again!
    <br>We thank God Almighty for the wonderful healing and miracle He has done in your family.
    <br>And we encourage you - miracles and all of God's blessings are in His Word.
    <br>So continue to make God's Word the standard for your life
    <br>and this shall remain permanent, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
