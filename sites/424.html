    <br>PROPHECY TIME
    <br>There is a dispute over a child.
    <br>You need to reconcile. There is need for a reconciliation.
    <br>It is true.
    <br>Sometimes, we don't know where our problem comes from.
    <br>We begin to ask God to bless us but sometimes, there are mountains somewhere
    <br>that are standing against us.
    <br>We may not see it as a problem but it is a mighty problem.
    <br>If this vision is not given to you, you will keep asking for a breakthrough.
    <br>There can be no breakthrough without this reconciliation.
    <br>Man of God, what you said about me is true.
    <br>Without this reconciliation, getting this girl, standing and coming out to say:
    <br>"I am the father", you cannot get it right in life.
    <br>Man of God, it is true.
    <br>Man of God, please help me. I want to get this baby back to my life.
    <br>Please help me, Man of God.
    <br>There was a time that they took you to a witch doctor.
    <br>Do you remember it?
    <br>It is true, Man of God.
    <br>You were looking for deliverance.
    <br>There was a time they gave you a handkerchief.
    <br>It is true.
    <br>Okay.
    <br>After your deliverance, you will get this child back.
    <br>And you will pay the woman and say: "Sorry". This woman will forgive you.
    <br>Now, you can start your life again.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>After that prophecy and the man was delivered,
    <br>he went back to his country, and he was able to trace the lady.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Since fourteen years.
    <br>Let me tell you about deliverance.
    <br>Once they talk to you - one-on-one - that is deliverance.
    <br>Question and answer is what they provide.
    <br>My name is Frank Dagbe.
    <br>I come from Ghana.
    <br>Firstly, I want to thank the man of God immensely for allowing himself to be used by God Almighty
    <br>to dig out the root cause of my problems.
    <br>I was here in December 2008 for breakthrough, and the man of God saw me.
    <br>I was sitting here and he said I was looking for breakthrough
    <br>but there is a dispute over a child in my life.
    <br>I should go and reconcile and thank this woman immensely
    <br>before there would be breakthrough in my life.
    <br>Actually, that was done and as I'm here,
    <br>I can say that there is a total breakthrough in my life.
    <br>Before then, things weren't going well.
    <br>That was why I came here because I was watching Emmanuel TV
    <br>and I saw what God uses the man of God to do in people's lives.
    <br>He came here for breakthrough -
    <br>there was no job, no money.
    <br>I said: "Look, this is the problem you have.
    <br>This is the root of your problem.
    <br>Some years past, there was a woman you abandoned.
    <br>You said you don't know; you are a small boy.
    <br>You are the owner of the child."
    <br>I said: "Don't worry. After this deliverance, you will just see the whole thing,
    <br>and they too will be looking for you.
    <br>As you are looking for them, they will be looking for you.
    <br>If they now see you, they will say, "Thank You, Jesus! We've been looking for you!"
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The man of God said that there is a dispute over a child.
    <br>Actually, before she was conceived, I denied her,
    <br>saying that I wasn't the one who impregnated her mother.
    <br>They came to meet my parents and then my father called me away from her parents
    <br>that I should accept it because he's also a man; he went through all
    <br>this when he was in school, that I should say the truth but I still denied it.
    <br>Clap for his father.
    <br>You see a good father.
    <br>His good father called him secretly and said: "Look, I'm a man.
    <br>What I'm seeing now, from the look of things, this pregnancy of three months -
    <br>you are the owner."
    <br>He said: "No, no, no!"
    <br>What the man of God said is nothing but the truth
    <br>because I never knew that that was the problem.
    <br>I even connived with one of my cousins to support me to deny her.
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Look at the way God called me into his life.
    <br>He came from Ghana crying but the Lord said: "No, no, no!
    <br>That child of fourteen years ago you denied!
    <br>Go back and take the child. If not, you will be poorer than this".
    <br>I never knew that that was the problem.
    <br>Actually, I was looking for breakthrough.
    <br>I want to express my gratitude to the man of God for allowing himself
    <br>to be used immensely for my problem.
    <br>Now, after the prophecy, there is breakthrough in my life.
    <br>I've got a contract now. Even as I'm here, there was a phone call for me.
    <br>A contract is waiting for me in Ghana now.
    <br>Man of God, I thank you immensely for what God has used you to do in my life.
    <br>You have just started because I'm seeing you travel to Canada.
    <br>You should get ready.
    <br>Let's ask the little girl.
    <br>How are you feeling now,
    <br>now that you have discovered your father after fourteen years?
    <br>My name is Hilda Dagbe.
    <br>I am 14 years old.
    <br>I am happy to see my father now.
    <br>SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If not this message, this man would have denied forever.
    <br>The lady said I am happy now. After fourteen years, I am now able to know my father.
    <br>Man of God, I thank you.
    <br>I thank God for using you to tell my father
    <br>because when I'm in school, I've been seeing people's parents coming for them at school.
    <br>So, now I'm happy that I'm with my father.
