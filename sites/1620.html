  <p>    
    <br>Give me your heart, please.
    <br>I was watching Emmanuel TV since morning
    <br>and I kept looking at the same issue - issue of belief.
    <br>While the program was going on, I saw many people who after being touched,
    <br>they would still stretch their hands to drag the Prophet, "Prophet, touch here".
    <br>After touching here, "Touch here".
    <br>There was a man to whom the Prophetess was dragged to;
    <br>the man said, "Touch here".
    <br>Prophetess was looking at him, "Touch where?"
    <br>"Here."
    <br>I was watching and I said, "Ah".
    <br>How many places do you want them to touch in your body?
    <br>During the mass prayer you saw people being delivered, vomiting and all of that -
    <br>they were not touching them and they got delivered.
    <br>Let's quickly go to the Book of Mark 9.
    <br>Are you there?
    <br>Mark 9:19.
    <br>I read:
    <br>" 'You unbelieving generation,' Jesus replied,
    <br>'How long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?
    <br>Bring the boy to me.' "
    <br>Verse 19, I read again.
    <br>Insert you name this time.
    <br>You don't need to read it aloud, just read it in Spirit.
    <br>" 'You unbelieving generation,' Jesus replied,
    <br>'How long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you?
    <br>Bring the boy to me.' "
    <br>This is the case of people who after being touched still turn to be touched.
    <br>And if the prophets continue to touch all parts of their bodyies...
    <br>They say, "Where is Prophet T.B. Joshua?"
    <br>Verse 23:
    <br>" 'If you can?' said Jesus. 'Everything is possible for one who believes.' "
    <br>If you can...
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>... everything is possible
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>It is the issue of believing.
    <br>The problem of believing is made simple when we know that it is acting on what God has spoken.
    <br>It is made simple.
    <br>I cannot define it - that is just a simple definition.
    <br>You need to know that it is what God has spoken; act on what God has spoken.
    <br>Go! - Go.
    <br>Come! - Come.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>Simple.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is power in your mouth.
    <br>When I say power, I mean, salvation, blessing, healing, deliverance -
    <br>all of God's blessings in your mouth.
    <br>The belief in your heart is released by faith out of your mouth.
    <br>The belief in your heart is released by faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>The belief in your heart is released by faith.
    <br>This means the Spirit makes us to know that believing is possessing.
    <br>The belief in your heart is released by faith out of your mouth.
    <br>This means the Spirit makes us to know that believing is possessing.
    <br>The instant you believe it is yours, it is yours; you have it.
    <br>The instant, the moment you believe you have it, it is yours.
    <br>If you examine your life, you can know how much faith you have,
    <br>how much belief you have in God.
    <br>You can know.
    <br>I examine my life...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Examine your life,
    <br>all that has to do with you - just examine it.
    <br>You can know how much faith you have, how much belief you have in God - you can know.
    <br>How can somebody be telling you, "This, that..."?
    <br>You can know.
    <br>As long as you have faith, God will work for you.
    <br>As long as you have faith, He will work for you.
    <br>Simple.
    <br>So you can know if you are not a Christian, if you are not one.
    <br>Whenever you truly believe, your heart will be at rest.
    <br>You can know if you believe.
    <br>If you are a Christian you can know.
    <br>If you are not a Christian you can know.
    <br>If you are not a child of God you can know.
    <br>We should stop pretending.
    <br>When your heart is uneasy, worried, when you are afraid of this and that,
    <br>this shows that you have not yet believed.
    <br>When one believes, he is at rest.
    <br>You sleep...
    <br>Even when you have a nightmare, you say, "No, this is not for me. I know who I am."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When a person believes, he will no longer worry; you are still worried.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When a person believes, he will no longer worry".
    <br>When one believes, he is at rest.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Leave it for God
    <br>Don't worry yourself
    <br>Leave it for God
    <br>Don't cry no more
    <br>Jesus is alive praise God
    <br>You can face tomorrow
    <br>He understands what you are 
    <br>Passing through today
    <br>Let us glorify His name
    <br>That you believe does not mean you cannot face challenges.
    <br>That you believe does not mean you cannot face trials, even temptation.
    <br>But Jesus said, "In this world there will be tribulation. Cheer up!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is no need for us to struggle to believe.
    <br>"If I'm not healed, I don't believe.
    <br>If I am healed, I will believe.
    <br>If I don't fall or manifest, I will not believe.
    <br>If I manifest, I will believe."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "There is no need for us to struggle to believe."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[There is no need for us to struggle to believe.]
    <br>"If I don't vomit, I will not believe.
    <br>If I vomit, I will believe.
    <br>If I don't vomit blood, I will not believe."
    <br>There is no need to struggle to believe, there is no need for you to tremble to believe.
    <br>"Unless it happens to me. If it does not happen to me. No, it is not real.
    <br>If it does not happen to me, it is not real." - no.
    <br>Within a second we believe spontaneously, naturally because faith comes from God.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>Within a second we believe.
    <br>There is no need for us to struggle to believe.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
