    <br>President John Evans Atta Mills during his visit to The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations

    <br>His Excellency Professor John Evans Atta Mills
    <br>President of the Republic of Ghana
    <br>I want you to bow down your head for a minute.
    <br>As the Spirit directs, offer a prayer the Spirit puts in your heart.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>It is time to worship the Lord in the beauty of His holiness.
    <br>Here in our midst today, we want to welcome our father, the President of the Republic of Ghana,

    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>Our choristers, they have said it all:
    <br>Making God's Word the standard for our life.
    <br>I will give just a two-to-three-minute congratulatory message.
    <br>This will be taken from the Book of Hebrews, chapter 6:
    <br>"Therefore let us leave the elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity..."
    <br>Verse 19: "We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure.
    <br>It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain..."
    <br>Wow.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>The impressive turnout of our nation, the great nation Ghana, for the inauguration of our Excellency
    <br>indicated that Ghanaians are hopeful of your government and the Bible says here, Jesus is our hope.
    <br>This hope is the anchor of the scope of forgiveness -
    <br>expands the scope of forgiveness, mercy, peace.
    <br>Are you hopeless?
    <br>Jesus is our hope.
    <br>Are you looking for a friend?
    <br>Jesus is a friend closer than your brother.
    <br>Our Excellency, hope comes when we have total dependence on God.
    <br>Total dependence on God is when God is the only thing for us, only reason, not one of those things -
    <br>then God gives power to rule the nation.
    <br>When there is total dependence on God, there is hope for the weak,
    <br>the lonely, the widow, physically challenged, fatherless, in general - less privileged and privileged.
    <br>Concerning works of charity, charitable organisations should be encouraged to touch the grassroots.
    <br>By charitable organisations, I mean those who spend more on others, less on themselves,
    <br>those in our country, the nation Ghana - there are many who spend more on others, less on themselves.
    <br>These people should be encouraged.
    <br>They will reach the grassroots.
    <br>Without taking much of your time, because we will give our father a minute to address us:
    <br>A true government is mirrored through conducting a free and fair election which will live after you.
    <br>This is a major problem the African political continent is facing today.
    <br>Take note of this, at the end of your journey:
    <br>free and fair election.
    <br>And I want to appreciate our former president there for a successful election, and the presidential candidates.
    <br>Congratulations!
    <br>Let's take the case of Joseph in the Book of Genesis 37 and 39.
    <br>Consider the case of Joseph.
    <br>Joseph had the power as a prime minister to pay back Potiphar.
    <br>Two: He had the power to repay his brothers with evil but in all this, He feared God more.
    <br>He knew that whatever he would do to his brothers that he would do unto God.
    <br>Our Excellency, the hard times you went through -
    <br>I mean your dry pit, I mean your Potiphar's house, I mean your prison condition,
    <br>were God's own way of preserving you for the glory ahead.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>The hard times, the difficulties, the trials, the persecution, the hatred you went through -
    <br>I mean your dry pit, your Potiphar's house, your prison condition in the past,
    <br>were God's own way of preserving you for the glory ahead.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>If not for our troubles, our hard times, we would not have come to God.
    <br>This means, God sometimes uses hard times to draw us to Himself
    <br>so that we can properly take our position and our possession in Him.
    <br>Your trouble could be poverty, your trouble could be sickness, your trouble could be affliction,
    <br>your trouble could be setback, your trouble could be hatred, your trouble could be persecution -
    <br>I mean, foolish things.
    <br>God sometimes uses our trouble to draw us to Himself
    <br>so that we can take our proper position and possession in Him.
    <br>Your Excellency, thank you.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>Man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, my brothers and sisters in Christ, I want to thank the Almighty
    <br>for making it possible for me to be here to take part in this thanksgiving service.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>I am no stranger to The Synagogue.
    <br>Indeed, I've been coming here very regularly and I've known the man of God for more than 10 years.
    <br>Indeed, I first met him when I was the Vice President of the Republic of Ghana
    <br>and I've continued to maintain the relationship ever since.
    <br>What I've seen today is a rather humbling experience for me.
    <br>You remember, a few weeks ago, I came around and when I was interviewed, I made reference to the fact
    <br>that I will be contesting for the presidency in Ghana in December elections.
    <br>Now, if there is anybody who does not believe in God,
    <br>I would say that our elections should change that person's mind and let him believe in God.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>We prayed for peace and stability and unity for our dear nation before, during and after the election.
    <br>We cried to God because He is our Creator, and He is a Provider of all these.
    <br>God gave us more than we asked for.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>My brothers and sisters in Christ, the man of God took special interest in what was happening
    <br>with the organisation of prayer groups and all,
    <br>and I know that many of my brothers and sisters in the congregation also
    <br>took it upon themselves to pray not only for Atta Mills but for all the competitors and also for Mother Ghana.
    <br>I thank you all and I would urge that we continue to pray not only for Atta Mills but for Mother Ghana,
    <br>so that we remain united, we remain stable and we enjoy peace.
    <br>The words of our national anthem or some of the words say that God should bless our Homeland Ghana
    <br>and make our nation great and strong.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>This is what I would wish for our dear nation.
    <br>There were times when, human being as I am, the body was weak but the soul was willing.
    <br>Sometimes one began to ask questions and on such occasions,
    <br>I would call the man of God or he would call me and say, "How are you?"
    <br>Now, let me just say one thing.
    <br>When I told him that our elections would be on December 7th
    <br>and that there was a possibility that the results will be announced on the 8th, 9th or 10th of December,
    <br>he looked at me for some time, smiled and said: "I don't see it that way,
    <br>I can see three different elections ahead of you..."
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>"...and that the results are going to be declared in January."
    <br>I was asking myself, if there is a runoff and the runoff is usually on the 28th of December,
    <br>give ourselves two days for the electoral commissioner to come up with the result -
    <br>how is it possible that we will run into January?
    <br>Well, I kept these words at the back of my mind.
    <br>We had the elections alright on December 7th.
    <br>There was a runoff on December 28th and then we had a third election in one constituency,
    <br>and the results were announced in January.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>My brothers and sisters in Christ, God is all-knowing, God is omnipresent, omniscient
    <br>and indeed, the only Repository of wisdom, knowledge and understanding.
    <br>My prayer to God is to give me nothing but wisdom - wisdom to undertake my responsibilities,
    <br>to give me a big heart to play the role that He Himself has chosen for me.
    <br>And we should always remember that nobody came into the world on his or her own.
    <br>The Creator brought us into this world and He directs our affairs.
    <br>I believe that the elections in Ghana have changed the minds of many people.
    <br>I believe there are many people who are going to give themselves to God because of what has happened.
    <br>I would always want God's name to be glorified.
    <br>I come here as the same old John Evans Atta Mills.
    <br>I may probably have a title, but I'm the same person and I will continue to come here
    <br>whenever the opportunity offers itself.
    <br>Because there is strength in fellowship, there is strength in sharing views and ideas with like-minded people.
    <br>My brothers and sisters, we are all the same - children of God.
    <br>Let's help one another, let's hold each other's hands and whatever happens to us,
    <br>let's give praise to the Almighty God.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>Man of God, I want to thank you, and I want to thank the Almighty for using you and many others.
    <br>God, we thank You for Your glory.
    <br>May Your name be praised forever and ever. Amen.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>Let's pray. I want you to open your lips with faith in your heart.
    <br>Ask God to give him the spirit of a finisher. 
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The spirit of a finisher!
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Open your lips, ask Jesus to give him the will and desire to complete what he has started.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The will and desire.
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>Open your lips with faith in your heart.
    <br>Ask God to act in him that he may keep his resolutions. Prayer!
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>Ask God to strengthen him to defend all that he promised. Prayer!
    <br>"TB JOSHUA Prophesied My Victory!!!" | PRESIDENT ATTA MILLS OF GHANA
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>This is the day that the Lord has made.
    <br>We're here today to celebrate with our father,
    <br>His Excellency Professor John Evans Atta Mills,
    <br>the President of the Republic of Ghana.
    <br>We thank God all the way long.
    <br>If God had not overcome for us, there would be no need for this celebration,
    <br>just as there would be no need for this meeting.
    <br>This is your day.
    <br>It's your day Atta Mills
    <br>The day you've always dreamed of
    <br>Remember to make God's Word
    <br>The standard for your life
    <br>It's your day Atta Mills
    <br>The day you've always dreamed of
    <br>Remember to make God's Word
    <br>The standard for your life
    <br>It's your day Atta Mills
    <br>The day you've always dreamed of
    <br>Remember to make God's Word
    <br>The standard for your life
