    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>There is a brother that just came back from the prison yard.
    <br>The key thing is that your wife was the one who reported you
    <br>and immediately they deported you.
    <br>He is under the gallery.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>I am the person the man of God prophesied about, who has been to prison
    <br>and was reported by his wife.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua ministers prayer and deliverance to people
    <br>from across the world in the name of Jesus Christ.
    <br>As he prays for Mr Sioni, the evil spirit responsible for his recent calamity is arrested
    <br>and confesses its crimes.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Family idol.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>Fornication.
    <br>What else?
    <br>Pornography.
    <br>Debt.
    <br>Deportation.
    <br>You deported him from where?
    <br>From America.
    <br>What happened that he was deported?
    <br>He abused a child.
    <br>Failure.
    <br>What have you done to his marriage?
    <br>No marriage.
    <br>How did you enter him?
    <br>Idol.
    <br>After the confession of the evil spirit for the world to hear and learn,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua delivers Mr. Sioni from every hidden spirit
    <br>threatening his peace, his success and his future.
    <br>As he falls to the ground, the wicked spirit is cast out forever.
    <br>Thank You, Lord! I'm delivered!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Emmanuel! (God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Sioni Ayodeji Fanugbami
    <br>I am from Ondo State (Nigeria).
    <br>I was a resident in the U.S. before coming back to Nigeria.
    <br>First of all, I want to apologise to the man of God
    <br>because I used to be one of those people who really didn't believe in this ministry and the man of God,
    <br>following the bandwagon of disinformation because people used to say that
    <br>he buries some cows somewhere here,
    <br>he uses snake power,
    <br>he sleeps with some of his staff,
    <br>he consults the devil.
    <br>So I believed all that.
    <br>But I never knew that he was the one who would end up being my deliverer.
    <br>I want to apologise and ask for forgiveness;
    <br>ask God for forgiveness for castigating the man of God.
    <br>The problem that brought me here - as the prophet said - was prison.
    <br>In 2006, I left the country on U.S. visa lottery.
    <br>Ok. Before you left the country, sir, could you tell us a little bit more about the kind of family you are from,
    <br>and what happened that you left the country for America.
    <br>I came from a very poor background.
    <br>My people were still in Ondo State.
    <br>They even still do not fancy me coming here.
    <br>But there is nothing that anybody can do; this is my place of salvation.
    <br>Through me, all of them will come here eventually.
    <br>This is a part of my testimony - my life story.
    <br>I came from a very poor background.
    <br>I was struggling before I left.
    <br>I was working at a printing press in Lagos before I left.
    <br>It was during that time in 2005 that I applied for the visa lottery.
    <br>I was selected, went through the process and then travelled out.
    <br>My family background - I was born a Muslim.
    <br>On my father's side they are Muslims; on my mother's side they are Christians.
    <br>In the middle we have the family idols and all that.
    <br>I have really been exposed to all kinds of horrible elements
    <br>like eating at the shrine, going with masquerades,
    <br>a lot of bad dreams - dreaming of snakes, cows chasing me, people shooting at me.
    <br>So it has really been tough but in 2006 I left the country for the USA.
    <br>When I got there in 2006, I was supposed to be serious with God.
    <br>But I was never serious with God; I was living the American dream in the wrong way.
    <br>I began drinking alcohol.
    <br>As someone who had never been drinking before travelling out,
    <br>I began drinking when I got to the U.S.
    <br>The level of alcohol I was drinking -
    <br>you would expect someone who had never been drinking to start small.
    <br>But I started with the strongest alcohol you could find there
    <br>like the fire-in-your-bones alcohol so that when I drank it, I passed out.
    <br>I would not know where I was until the next day when I opened my eyes.
    <br>All these things continued.
    <br>At a point, when I was at university, I dated seven different ladies.
    <br>None of them knew each other.
    <br>I would schedule one for the morning, I would schedule one for the afternoon,
    <br>I would schedule one for the evening and schedule one for the night.
    <br>I was really out there.
    <br>I began smoking and going to clubs.
    <br>So at that point, you were in a relationship with seven different women at the same time,
    <br>and none of them knew that you were with another woman?
    <br>None of them knew.
    <br>I kept on going like that.
    <br>I lost focus.
    <br>Eventually I even had to drop out of university - biochemistry with a focus on premedicine.
    <br>I had to drop out eventually.
    <br>It was one the ladies that I had been with for three years that called the police on me
    <br>because one of the nights that I was at her house -
    <br>I was already drunk, we were both drunk, I was wasted -
    <br>by the time I opened my eyes in the morning, I was in the child's bedroom.
    <br>So the problem was already there and the child told the mother that I was trying to rape her.
    <br>We just want to understand clearly what happened in this scenario.
    <br>You said you were completely drunk
    <br>and when you woke up, you were in the bedroom of a young child -
    <br>the child of that lady.
    <br>And that is how you woke up in that scenario?
    <br>Yes, I was extremely drunk, we were both drunk - I and the child's mum.
    <br>When I woke up---
    <br>Like I said, when I drank, I wouldn't know what happened because of the alcohol I took.
    <br>If you google the kind of alcohol I took, it can drive a car.
    <br>That was what I was drinking.
    <br>And tequila is very strong.
    <br>And brandy is very strong.
    <br>So I would blend tequila and brandy; I would spice it with a little bit of orange juice.
    <br>That is what I would drink.
    <br>I would be lost.
    <br>Even one of my girlfriends said---
    <br>There was a night that I was with her - this is another lady.
    <br>After I woke up in morning, she said she was scared because she thought I was dead
    <br>because I was just laying in bed like I wasn't breathing, my chest wasn't moving.
    <br>So that is the way I would drink.
    <br>I would drink and then just lose consciousness.
    <br>This is precisely what happened with this lady that night.
    <br>When I woke up in the morning, that is when I realised, "Oh, why did I end up in here?"
    <br>And then the little child told her mother that I was trying to rape her.
    <br>She called the police; I couldn't reconcile with her.
    <br>I was arrested.
    <br>I was put into detention for three months, got bonded out and then I began going to trial.
    <br>It was when I now began going to trial in 2013 that I met a man of God
    <br>whose ministry is a partner with Emmanuel TV in the U.S.
    <br>He was the one who introduced me to this ministry.
    <br>At first when he told me, I was like, "What in the world are you doing with T.B. Joshua?
    <br>You could have gone to a better place where they've got real fire,
    <br>where they preach real gospel".
    <br>I never knew that T.B. Joshua was the one who would end up delivering me.
    <br>Even though I came from the same region, the same state where the prophet is from,
    <br>I never truly believed in him.
    <br>That was how I got to know Emmanuel TV.
    <br>So it was an American pastor in the USA
    <br>who was actually the one who told you about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Even though you are a Nigerian and from the same state, you never believed in him.
    <br>It was this encouragement from an American pastor that opened your eyes
    <br>to discover Emmanuel TV and know Prophet T.B. Joshua - the truth about him.
    <br>Absolutely.
    <br>I was even trying to discourage him from talking about it or playing the videos.
    <br>I was like, "This man ain't real. Go to other places where they preach real gospel".
    <br>Eventually I started listening. I was like, "I must listen to what this man is all about".
    <br>Even though I had known about him before I left the country
    <br>but because of disinformation, I didn't want to have anything to do with him.
    <br>Eventually I began listening to the prophet, and I began praying with him.
    <br>And then hope started coming to me.
    <br>Even though I was already going through trial -
    <br>in fact, I was looking at 30 to 40 years in prison for the sentence.
    <br>When I began praying with the prophet, hope began coming.
    <br>When I lost the case and they gave me simple battery, I was shocked,
    <br>"Oh my God! Without a paid lawyer and you got a public defender!
    <br>And you got a simple battery over a case as significant as this!"
    <br>I was grateful and then they gave me a five-year sentence in 2014.
    <br>By the special grace of God, they let me out after two years.
    <br>When they let me out, I came here and I have been coming since I got back this year.
    <br>Ok. So a sentence that you were expecting to be 30 to 40 years because of the issue of rape
    <br>actually ended up being just a five-year prison sentence.
    <br>And after two years, you were released and deported back to Nigeria.
    <br>Absolutely.
    <br>When they let me out, I had to leave the country because I was not a U.S. citizen.
    <br>After I had been in the U.S. for ten years, they said I had to leave because they couldn't let me stay there.
    <br>I signed and then ended up in Nigeria.
    <br>When I came, it happened that as God loves me so much, He gave me a new beginning.
    <br>On the 7th of this month, I had a revelation and I saw the prophet giving me a note.
    <br>On that note, he wrote the number 17.
    <br>That was on the 7th of this month.
    <br>So he gave me a note with the number 17 on it but I never really understood it.
    <br>Here was the prophet giving me a note with the number 17 on it but I never really understood it.
    <br>But then when I came to church on Sunday, the 16th, he called my case.
    <br>And when I stepped out, that was it.
    <br>On the 17th that he had written down on the note was the day I got my deliverance.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Brother, can you just describe to us when you received that deliverance.
    <br>What happened to you as the prophet prayed for you?
    <br>Even before I left Nigeria, it had been one nightmare after another.
    <br>I would see cows chasing me, like I said.
    <br>I would see all kinds of strangers; some of them would be men trying to romance me.
    <br>Snakes would be biting me; people would be shooting at me.
    <br>I got shot three times in my dreams.
    <br>Masquerades were coming after me like, "You got something we need!"
    <br>They would be chasing me all around.
    <br>It was one nightmare after another - eating in the dreams and all that.
    <br>But then after I was prayed for, since Monday, I have been sleeping like a little baby.
    <br>I have no bad dreams - no woman is showing up in my dreams;
    <br>no ghost is trying to get me.
    <br>I'm grateful to God.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So that was how our brother was completely delivered.
    <br>Brother, as the prophet prayed for you, we saw that evil spirit manifesting.
    <br>Can you just recall what happened when he prayed for you?
    <br>How did you feel at that moment when he prayed for you?
    <br>When his hand hit me, it was like my brain was put into trillion different places.
    <br>And then I just lost it.
    <br>There was something telling me, "What are you doing?"
    <br>But I couldn't control it; I was no longer myself.
    <br>The power of God already took over.
    <br>In fact, the Sunday night that the prophet called me out,
    <br>I had a dream and I saw this huge guy that I had never seen before.
    <br>One of his arms was about my whole size.
    <br>The guy was so huge.
    <br>That was the Sunday night I received the prophecy.
    <br>He was telling me, "Oh, where have you been?
    <br>Because I didn't come with you to church on Sunday.
    <br>Do you think you can escape from me?"
    <br>I asked him, "Who are you? and then the dream just changed.
    <br>That was the ancestral spirit, the family idol,
    <br>the stronghold that had been impeding me all my life.
    <br>And that was how that spirit was cast out,
    <br>and ever since then your life has changed?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>Brother, in the course of your testimony, you mentioned as well
    <br>that you were under the affliction of this spirit of lust, alcoholism, smoking.
    <br>Ever since that deliverance, what can you tell us about the changes in those areas?
    <br>When that crisis hit, it was like the Lord Jesus actually used that crisis
    <br>to slap me back into reality because He loves me; I believe He loves me.
    <br>I have seen Him in my revelation too.
    <br>All the urges, all the desires, all the gravings for all that are gone now.
    <br>I have peace like I have never had before in my life.
    <br>That hit me when I was delivered.
    <br>It was like somebody lifted a truck off my chest.
    <br>I felt so light.
    <br>After my deliverance I was laughing and rejoicing; I was happy.
    <br>Ever since then I have just been happy.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>We thank God for our brother's life.
    <br>Right now, sir, what is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>Oh man! The greatest lesson for me here is:
    <br>If God loves you, He won't take 'no' for an answer.
    <br>It is very painful to be disciplined by God, even though the end is going to be good.
    <br>But it is painful.
    <br>I really didn't have to go through all this
    <br>but this is the way I chose to learn a simple lesson.
    <br>And the lesson is: Don't ever be on the wrong side of history with God.
    <br>Believe in Him, trust in Him.
    <br>Put all of your hope on Him.
    <br>And He will definitely take you to your final destination.
    <br>Amen. Glory be to God. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Finally, sir, you said you were in the past among those who condemned Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>criticised him, call him all sorts of names.
    <br>But at the end of the day, the person you thought was a devil
    <br>ended up being the same person that God used to deliver you.
    <br>What is your word of advice to people who have maybe a similar impression
    <br>or have a negative opinion towards Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>as a result of rumours or slanderous remarks they have heard
    <br>based on your own life experience?
    <br>Even now when I hear the prophet, it is like I have never even heard his voice before.
    <br>I can feel the love coming out of his messages.
    <br>I can feel the power coming out of his heart.
    <br>My advice to everybody out there who is sceptical is:
    <br>Please, stop begin sceptical; you are delaying yourself.
    <br>You are really holding yourself back.
    <br>It is not godly, it is not righteous to talk against a man of God.
    <br>The step of righteousness is for you to go to God and find out -
    <br>"Is this guy real? Is this guy genuine?" -
    <br>before you join folks who don't know what they are doing to be castigating a man of God.
    <br>Please, one word: Stop!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time!
    <br>TESTIMONY CONTINUES
    <br>My name is Sioni Ayodeji Fanugbami.
    <br>I am from Ondo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I was recently deported from America.
    <br>You are welcome, brother. Can you tell us what Jesus Christ has done in your life
    <br>since you stepped your feet into The SCOAN?
    <br>It has been mind blowing; it's been amazing.
    <br>It is undescribable.
    <br>Contrary to my previous opinion about this place, I was really proven wrong.
    <br>Since I came here, the prophet has showered me with nothing but love.
    <br>They've been taking care of me.
    <br>I received my deliverance here, and I'm extremely grateful to God and to the prophet.
    <br>We thank God for your life, brother.
    <br>Now that you have received your deliverance and are ready to start life afresh with Christ Jesus,
    <br>what plans do you have now, what steps you want to take?
    <br>Actually, my number one priority in life now, in fact the only desire I have now is to do the will of God.
    <br>Even though I already have so many business plans drawn up,
    <br>I know I need wisdom to guide me where to go to from here.
    <br>My number one desire now is to do the will of God.
    <br>If I do business, it is going to be Kingdom business.
    <br>And if I do ministry, it is going to be Kingdom ministry.
    <br>Just looking for every opportunity to serve God for the rest of my days.
    <br>We thank God for your life. On a very practical note, when you were deported from America to Nigeria,
    <br>is it that you literally came with nothing?
    <br>I absolutely came with nothing.
    <br>In fact, the pants and trousers I am wearing right now are the only trousers I came down with,
    <br>with two shirts and one pair of shoes.
    <br>I have been living with my junior brother ever since I got back.
    <br>In fact, I came back from America with 280 USD.
    <br>Armed robbers came to the house and stole some of it.
    <br>The rest just went into personal upkeep.
    <br>I really have nothing, and I literally have no one to help me.
    <br>We have listened to our brother. We thank God that he has been delivered from his past life.
    <br>He has been restored by our Lord Jesus Christ, here at The SCOAN
    <br>after receiving that word of prophecy and deliverance.
    <br>Brother, we are here right now with a message for you from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The man of God said that he wants to support you in all departments of your life
    <br>as you are about to start this new journey with Christ.
    <br>Not only in your spiritual life but also materially and financially as well.
    <br>So on behalf of Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners,
    <br>we are here to present to you this cash gift of 200,000 naira as well as the Word of God.
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>This is super amazing!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua!
    <br>This is mind blowing! This is beyond me!
    <br>In fact, my mindset for coming here was not for money because I could spend money easily.
    <br>My mindset for coming here was really to encounter the real love of God of Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>and I'm glad I have done so.
    <br>This is the first part of my testimony.
    <br>The second, third, fourth, fifth parts are still coming.
    <br>But I'm extremely grateful to the prophet.
    <br>I thank the Emmanuel TV partners.
    <br>I love you, Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Wow, we thank God Almighty.
    <br>In addition to the 200,000 naira, we are also giving you the Word of God, 'The Mirror',
    <br>just as a reminder for you as you have rightly said.
    <br>Go out there and make the Word of God the standard for your life.
    <br>So once again, this is 200,000 naira as well as the Word of God
    <br>from Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners
    <br>for our brother to really begin his new life with Christ Jesus in a wonderful way.
    <br>Thank you, Prophet T.B. Joshua! Thank you, Emmanuel TV partners!
    <br>Thank You, Lord Jesus, for bringing me here!
    <br>I'm grateful; I'm extremely grateful.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Amen. We thank God for your life once again, brother.
    <br>Finally, we'd just like to ask: Now that you have received all these wonderful blessings
    <br>from our Lord Jesus Christ, what is your word of advice and encouragement to our viewers?
    <br>Oh my God! Please, people all over the world, stop procrastinating.
    <br>Stop listening to people that are castigating the prophet.
    <br>Please find the means to come here.
    <br>Find a way to come here.
    <br>Solution is here, love is here and you can't find that in most places.
    <br>Please come here and get delivered.
    <br>Come here and meet the Lord.
    <br>Come here - the prophet is waiting for you with arms stretched out
    <br>and with nothing but love in his heart.
    <br>The Lord God Almighty is here, Heaven is already open up over here, waiting for you.
    <br>Stop procrastinating, come here right away.
    <br>The Lord is waiting for you.
    <br>Amen. We thank God for our life.
    <br>Indeed, our brother is encouraging you to seek our Lord Jesus Christ in spirit and truth
    <br>and we believe Jesus will guide everyone to a living church
    <br>where the Holy Spirit will take control of their case.
    <br>Brother, we thank God once again for your life.
    <br>We pray that God will give you the grace to continue making His Word the standard for your life,
    <br>and we are sure you are coming back with even more wonderful testimonies, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
