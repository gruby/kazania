    <br>Hi. I’m Gary Hull, a general manager of the newest radio station in Israel - “Voice Of Hope” for all the middle east.
    <br>We are so glad that God has opened His door to give us the place next to the beautiful Sea of Galilee,
    <br>where Jesus walked on the water, so that we bring the people the bread of life throughout all the middle east;
    <br>throughout Lebanon, through Syria and Jordan, and of course throughout the beautiful land of Galilee.
    <br>Our programs are being produced locally, and we are also going to be producing programs for other ministries
    <br>around the world, presenting the gospel of Jesus in the Arabic language to all who would listen.
    <br>We hope to encourage Christians who have lost their homes through sufferings and warfare.
    <br>We hope to encourage others who don't yet know the Lord to come to know the One who can save them
    <br>and give them eternal life.
    <br>Today we are so glad to be able to walk together with Prophet Joshua in the land of Jesus.
    <br>It is so good to know that he is continuing the broadcast the Word of God on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Thank you for watching Emmanuel TV and stay tuned.
    <br>Be blessed.

    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Arrives At The Sea Of Galilee To Meet The Mayor Of Jordan Valley
    <br>Prophet!
    <br>Prophet Joshua! Hi. Thank you very much for coming to the Sea of Galilee.
    <br>Thank you Mayor. 
    <br>I am happy to meet you.
    <br>I appreciate that you came all the way from Nigeria.
    <br>I heard so much about you.

    <br>An Israeli TV Station Interviews Prophet T.B. Joshua As He Meets The Mayor Of Jordan Valley
    <br>Yes, exactly.
    <br>Pastor Joshua, may I ask, you are known as a Prophet; what is your prophecy for this land?
    <br>That’s why we are here.
    <br>Are we going to have war or peace?
    <br>No, don’t worry, that is why we are here.
    <br>We are here.
    <br>Whatever life brings, we will be here with you.
    <br>So, we are protected now?
    <br>By the grace of God.
    <br>Can you tell us in a few sentences, how did you get your power?
    <br>From my Father, Jesus, who was born in this land.
    <br>I am an inheritance of His grace – the grace of Jesus Christ.
    <br>What was your first prophecy?
    <br>It is not my prophecy; it is God’s prophecy.
    <br>You cure people by chasing the devil or demons out of them;
    <br>are demons here also in this land?
    <br>Demons are responsible for the pain, killing, stealing and destruction.
    <br>My purpose of praying for people is to give them relief,
    <br>to separate them from the demons that are responsible for the pain and affliction.
