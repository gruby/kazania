    458   HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN | TB Joshua Sermon
  </h3>
  <p>
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us â€“ Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God be with you, no one can be against you.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>Thank you for your time; I know you are blessed.
    <br>I want to take you towards some passages in the Bible,
    <br>and I know it will bless your soul, spirit and body.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Let's take a look at the Book of Romans 10.
    <br>We will take some of the proof reading there.
    <br>"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they may be saved."
    <br>That is the greatest thing you can desire for a friend - the salvation of soul.
    <br>The Bible says seek first the Kingdom, all shall be what?
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Added to you.]
    <br>Seek first what?
    <br>That is the desire for Israel here.
    <br>Verse 2:
    <br>"For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God,
    <br>but not according to knowledge."
    <br>What are they trying to say there?
    <br>Verse 3:
    <br>"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness,..."
    <br>You know, ignorance is a disease.
    <br>"... and seeking to establish their own righteousness,
    <br>have not submitted to the righteousness of God."
    <br>That could be regarded as self-righteousness.
    <br>The Bible says that self-righteousness boasts in itself,
    <br>while God's righteousness boasts in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>It means there are two ways of righteousness.
    <br>Verse 4:
    <br>"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes."
    <br>Everyone who believes.
    <br>Verse 5:
    <br>"For Moses writes about the righteousness which is of the law,
    <br>'The man who does those things shall live by them.' "
    <br>Let's go to verse 13:
    <br>"For 'whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.' "
    <br>I will take my title:
    <br>THE HIGHWAY TO HEAVEN
    <br>Let someone say, "The highway to Heaven".
    <br>You know what I mean by 'highway'?
    <br>Beautiful.
    <br>To get to Heaven, you must follow the way of the Cross.
    <br>What is the way of the Cross?
    <br>The highway to Heaven starts on this side of death
    <br>and the entrance is very easy to find.
    <br>The entrance to Heaven through the Bible is easy because the Bible says here
    <br>that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
    <br>Let someone say, "The entrance to Heaven is very easy to find".
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[The entrance to Heaven is very easy to find.]
    <br>When you take it from that Romans 10, 1-13, which I have read,
    <br>Paul declared here that the road to Heaven is not difficult to find.
    <br>Are you on the right road?
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>[Are you on the right road?]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Are you on the right road?]
    <br>Paul Apostle is saying here that the road to Heaven is not difficult to find nor to access.
    <br>Are you on the right road to Heaven?
    <br>That is the question you need to ask yourself.
    <br>It is right in your front...
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>... in the Word of God
    <br>because the Bible says He speaks to us through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "It is right in my front - the road to Heaven."
    <br>It is right in my front in the Word of God.
    <br>It is right in my front in the Word of God - the road to Heaven.
    <br>In that Book of John 14:6, Jesus said, "I'm the way, the truth and the life".
    <br>Take it with me - verse 6.
    <br>"Jesus said to him, I'm the way, the truth, and the life.
    <br>No one comes to the Father except through Me.' "
    <br>He died for our sin - broken the power of death by resurrection.
    <br>You need not fear where you are going when you know Jesus is going with you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "You need not fear where you are going when you know Jesus is going with you".
    <br>You are not alone.
    <br>Death is not a period; it is only a comma.
    <br>You have put a comma into your book when you are writing.
    <br>It is not a period; it is only a comma
    <br>because of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection.
    <br>It is not a period; it is only a comma.
    <br>We who put our faith in Him, in Christ Jesus,
    <br>can look at death not as a period but a comma.
    <br>If you put your faith in Christ Jesus, death is not a period but a comma.
    <br>Any day, even today, may be our final day on earth.
    <br>We need to be sure that we are ready to depart.
    <br>Are you?
    <br>Ask your neighbour, "Are you?"
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Are you?]
    <br>Ask your neighbour.
    <br>[Are you?]
    <br>If we are prepared to die, we are prepared to live.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you are prepared to die, you are prepared to live".
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>[If you are prepared to die, you are prepared to live.]
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Are you?"
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[Are you?]
    <br>That is the question for you to answer.
    <br>Will you be ready 
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>I will be ready when the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>I will be ready when the Lord shall come
    <br>Face your neighbour and say,
    <br>"If you are prepared to die, you are prepared to live."
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>[If you are prepared to die, you are prepared to live.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[If you are prepared to die, you are prepared to live.]
    <br>Are you?
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Are You PREPARED To Die???
    <br>Whether you are young or old, what matters
    <br>is the grace to continue living hereafter.
    <br>That is the grace.
    <br>Are You PREPARED To Die???
    <br>A man may die young yet be satisfied with living.
    <br>But a wicked man is not satisfied even with long life.
    <br>Continuing to trust God is the only way to get the things you are not ready for.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"Continuing to trust God is the only way to get the things you are not ready for."
    <br>If you are prepared to die, you are prepared to live.
    <br>I pray you will know when it is your time of departure.
    <br>I pray for you today that when it is time for you to depart, you will know,
    <br>in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Are You PREPARED To Die???
