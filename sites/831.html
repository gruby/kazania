  <p>    
    <br>This is Mr Friday.
    <br>He has come to The SCOAN with the problem of anus cancer.
    <br>This terrible disease has made it virtually impossible for him to sit, walk, or even sleep.
    <br>One can only imagine the excruciating pain that is caused by the cancer
    <br>protruding from the anus.
    <br>INCREDIBLE!!! Anus Cancer PROTRUDING From Man's Body VANISHES After Prayer!
    <br>My name is Mr Friday Igbaifua.
    <br>I have anus cancer.
    <br>I am 35 years old from Edo State.
    <br>Where have you been to in search of solution to this problem of anus cancer?
    <br>They have been taking me to herbalists to take herbal drugs.
    <br>I then said that all those herbal drugs could not work or cure this problem;
    <br>it is better I went to a church or I look for another solution.
    <br>That was how I came to The SCOAN today.
    <br>How has this problem of anus cancer affected your life?
    <br>What are the things you cannot do as a result of this problem?
    <br>I cannot walk, stand or even sleep ever since I have had this problem.
    <br>I have been in pain. As I am standing here right now, it is not me that is standing here
    <br>except I lie down.
    <br>I believe as I came to The SCOAN, I am going to be healed by God's grace.
    <br>Amen. We believe with you that God Almighty will heal you and set you free
    <br>from this problem of anus cancer, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>You can see the discomfort on Mr Friday's face.
    <br>Again, he shows the severity of his condition.
    <br>But he has come to The SCOAN, believing that Jesus Christ, the Master Healer,
    <br>would set him totally free.
    <br>HEALING TIME
    <br>Man of God, please have mercy on me.
    <br>Man of God, pray for me.
    <br>I cannot sleep.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, I want you to see what I am looking at.
    <br>He is a human being just like you.
    <br>And I believe that by looking at it, you give thanks to God
    <br>for what God is doing in your life.
    <br>And I know with your prayer, glory would be for God
    <br>and the man would be relieved in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Come on!
    <br>Healing In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>So, you are free.
    <br>A few days later, Mr Friday came back to testify to his miraculous healing from anus cancer.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Brother, can you tab your buttocks?
    <br>Tap it very well.
    <br>How are you feeling right now?
    <br>I'm not feeling any pain anymore.
    <br>Tap it again.
    <br>How do you feel?
    <br>I couldn't tap or touch it like this before. But now I can.
    <br>How do you feel now?
    <br>Everything is gone, it is healed.
    <br>You are free.
    <br>I am free.
    <br>No more pain.
    <br>But before now, were you able to tap it like this?
    <br>Before, I couldn't even touch it, not to talk of tapping it.
    <br>Now I can do everything.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>Yes, Mr Friday is totally healed after receiving prayer from Prophet T. B. Joshua in Jesus' name.
    <br>There is not a problem He can't solve and not a sickness He can't heal.
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>Now I am free, I give thanks to Jesus Christ.
    <br>I am free. I am healed. Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>The gentleman is here in our midst right now to share the incredible testimony
    <br>of what Jesus Christ has done in his life, completely restoring him through
    <br>that touch of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Right now we want to listen to him and give glory to God for everything He has done.
    <br>We can see the emotion he is displaying right now, considering where he is coming from
    <br>and what God Almighty has done for him and remove that burden and pain.
    <br>Brother, you are very welcome in Jesus' name.
    <br>Please introduce yourself to us, tell us your name and the lady standing beside you.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>People of God, I want you to say that 'hallelujah' louder than this
    <br>because I am the most happiest person standing here today.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Mr Friday Igbaifua. I come from Edo State, Nigeria.
    <br>I am 35 years old.
    <br>I came to give my testimony for the glory of God.
    <br>The lady standing here with me is my mother.
    <br>It was unfortunate.
    <br>One day, I went for the whole day, looking for a job. I am a professional truck driver.
    <br>Throughout that day, I really needed the toilet as I was feeling sick in my stomach.
    <br>I didn't understand.
    <br>I decided to look for a toilet.
    <br>At the toilet, I realised nothing came out but gas kept coming out of me.
    <br>I said, okay.
    <br>I stood up and because I could not go to the toilet, I decided to wear my trousers and go.
    <br>When I tried to clean myself up, I could feel something in my buttocks - the anus came out.
    <br>I wondered what this was and thought that I was going to die that day.
    <br>There was nobody to help me.
    <br>Later on, around 9 -10 o'clock in the evening, I struggled to put my clothes back on
    <br>and I would have entered a vehicle to go home.
    <br>Because of the thing that came out of my anus, I could not stop any vehicle or motorbike;
    <br>I had to struggle to trek from Tin-Can Island to Surulere to make sure that I got home.
    <br>I reached home at 2 o'clock in the morning.
    <br>I struggled to knock the door and my mother came out and asked why I came at a very late hour,
    <br>that I had not come home that late.
    <br>I explained to her and I pulled down my trousers and showed her my condition.
    <br>My mummy saw it and shouted, "Jesus! What is this?"
    <br>She said that this had never happened to any of her children and asked where it came from.
    <br>I said, "I didn't know".
    <br>She now said I should be patient until daybreak.
    <br>Then, we tried to look for a solution to that anus cancer.
    <br>She started calling some of her friends who asked her to take me to a hospital.
    <br>We rushed to the hospital.
    <br>When the doctor saw the anus cancer, he said that there was no solution to that problem but surgery.
    <br>My mother refused to take the doctor's suggestion to cut it off.
    <br>She said that I should remain alive as this was not her child's portion.
    <br>She started calling her relations, colleagues and friends
    <br>who later advised her to take me to a herbalist or a native doctor.
    <br>He may find a solution to anus cancer.
    <br>I decided to follow my mother to a herbalist and the woman said that she was going to do it.
    <br>My mother left me with the woman for almost five days.
    <br>The woman kept giving me different kinds of concoctions and forcing me to drink them.
    <br>She was putting things on the surface of the cancer and I thought I would die there.
    <br>The day my mummy came back, I told her that I wanted to follow her back home.
    <br>With all the pain, I decided it was better for me to stay at home.
    <br>The pain would not allow me to rest. Since that day, I could not sleep.
    <br>Sleep would never come, talkless of sitting down.
    <br>I would just lie down and say, "God, is this how people used to die?"
    <br>I said, "God, let me die once and for all instead of dying gradually."
    <br>But I still had faith and when I looked at the cancer through a mirror, I continued praying.
    <br>It was a few days ago when the pain was so much that I called my mum to take me to the hospital.
    <br>I said that if they wanted to cut off the cancer, they should cut it off because of the pain.
    <br>My mum agreed and when we got to the hospital,  we met a lot of people there.
    <br>They were attending to them one by one but because of the pain, I had to lie on the floor.
    <br>I kept on crying, rolling on the ground when suddenly an elderly man appeared to me.
    <br>He asked me what the problem was and I told him that it was anus cancer.
    <br>He said that they should take me to The SCOAN.
    <br>Mr Friday Matthew Igbaifua & Mother - Healed of Anus Cancer in Jesus' Name
    <br>I asked what The SCOAN was and whether it was a hospital.
    <br>The man answered that it was not a hospital but that a prophet would pray for me and
    <br>when he did, the cancer would be removed.
    <br>Mr Friday Matthew Igbaifua & Mother - Healed of Anus Cancer in Jesus' Name
    <br>I hope we all understand what our brother is saying.
    <br>As he was lying in agony on the floor of the hospital, actually hoping to get an operation
    <br>to remove that cancer coming out of his anus, an elderly man saw his condition
    <br>and advised him that he must come to The SCOAN.
    <br>That was actually in the hospital where he was preparing to undergo an operation.
    <br>Brother, just before you talk about coming here.
    <br>Can you just describe for the benefit of those here the pain you were in at that period.
    <br>Just try and describe that pain and how severe it was.
    <br>That pain was as if someone had died.
    <br>Someone who could not sleep. I could not sit down, talkless of standing.
    <br>It was like I was dead. It was a seriously terrible pain that I had never experienced in my life
    <br>or even seen in another person's life.
    <br>When we came to The SCOAN and the ushers saw my situation,
    <br>they even left the other people and started attending to my mum and I.
    <br>My mum told me that I was lucky as those people were attending to me.
    <br>They were running here and there.
    <br>Then, the pastor came out to start the ministration on that service day.
    <br>The usher now brought us to where the pastor would minister to me.
    <br>When I saw the pastor, I was wondering because I had been hearing about
    <br>T. B. Joshua but I had never heard about The SCOAN.
    <br>I now said, okay.
    <br>Since they said I should come to The SCOAN and it is prayer, God can heal me. I will receive my healing here.
    <br>That was what I believed in my mind.
    <br>As the man of God came out, I saw him praying and by the time he touched me,
    <br>I first of all thought, "What is this touch going to do in me?"
    <br>At the second touch, I said, "No" and at the third touch, I felt in my stomach
    <br>that they wanted to draw my anus inside.
    <br>It was like the anus cancer was forcing itself to go inside.
    <br>I was praying, "Go inside, in Jesus' name!" Then I said, "Thank You, Jesus. I am free".
    <br>I had that belief that I was free.
    <br>They gave me three bottles of Morning Water and said that I should drink one and
    <br>minister the other ones on the surface of the anus cancer.
    <br>When I got home, I prayed, "Let the Morning Water turn to the blood of Jesus
    <br>and wash out every disease and sickness from my stomach, in Jesus' name".
    <br>That's when I opened that Morning Water. I drank one and finished it.
    <br>I opened the other one. I now spoke to that one too and said,
    <br>"Since this is also water, let it be the blood of Jesus.
    <br>When I sprinkle the surface, let it wash all the sickness and every disease".
    <br>I kept on spraying the surface, spraying on it.
    <br>That night, I kept on spraying it before I slept.
    <br>It was that night, I went to the toilet like I never had in my life.
    <br>I went to the toilet and defaecated everything out of my stomach.
    <br>I then called my mummy and said, "Mummy, come and see the toilet!"
    <br>"Look at it; come and see!"
    <br>My mummy said, "What is this!"
    <br>I said, "Come and see!"
    <br>The toilet was filled up.
    <br>When I wanted to go to the toilet before, this is how I would do it.
    <br>I would be shouting but faeces would not drop out.
    <br>I would be eating frequently but I never defaecated since that day.
    <br>The day I drank that Morning Water, my brother, my sister,
    <br>I'm saying, it's like the toilet wanted to fill up.
    <br>The following morning, I went to the toilet again and I was not having pain. My body was free.
    <br>The anus cancer was still there but there was no pain.
    <br>I could not even sit down before, I always had to lie down.
    <br>But that following day, I sat on one side first.
    <br>I could not sit on one side before, I always had to lie down.
    <br>I was tired of lying down. I said that since this man of God has touched me
    <br>and given me the Morning Water, I believe my life had changed and I was healed.
    <br>It was last week I came back to The SCOAN and told the ushers that the cancer was disappearing.
    <br>They asked me if I was sure and I said yes, so they interviewed me.
    <br>They asked me to open the place and truly the cancer had gone so they said I should tap it.
    <br>When I tapped it, they said I should come today to give my testimony for the glory of God.
    <br>Brother, you mean to say that it was after this prayer, as you ministered the Morning Water
    <br>given to you in the church, you realised that first of all, the pain disappeared and then
    <br>the growth that was coming out of your anus actually shot back inside and completely disappeared.
    <br>When I used the last Morning Water, it drew the cancer inside.
    <br>I thought that maybe the cancer had come out again, but I checked and it was not there.
    <br>I ran to show my mum and she said, "God has done it! Praise the Lord!"
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>So brother, as you are standing here right now, you are completely restored
    <br>and you can do everything that you were not able to do before?
    <br>I'm the strongest man standing here right now!
    <br>Mr Friday Matthew Igbaifua & Mother - Healed of Anus Cancer in Jesus' Name
    <br>I was someone that if I wanted to sit down before, I would do it like this.
    <br>The day they brought me to the church, this is how I was doing it.
    <br>By the time the pain would be too much, I would change my position.
    <br>I would be dodging the face of the cancer.
    <br>I would sit like this and say, "God, I'm going to die here!"
    <br>But look at me today, can't you see that I'm a free man?
    <br>Mr Friday Matthew Igbaifua & Mother - Healed of Anus Cancer in Jesus' Name
    <br>Glory be to Jesus Christ! And you said before, brother, you could even barely walk.
    <br>Just demonstrate how you were moving before and how you can now move.
    <br>Before, I would put my hand on the knickers, shift it to prevent it from touching
    <br>the surface of the cancer so that it would not wound me.
    <br>Then, I would walk like this.
    <br>Mr Friday Matthew Igbaifua & Mother - Healed of Anus Cancer in Jesus' Name
    <br>But right now?
    <br>Right now, see how I have put on my trousers.
    <br>Do you want me to run?
    <br>Mr Friday Matthew Igbaifua & Mother - Healed of Anus Cancer in Jesus' Name
    <br>I give praise to God Almighty!
    <br>Amen. People of God, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Who else could do this but our Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>This was the brother that was at the point of death because of the severity of the pain.
    <br>The medical doctors actually wanted to operate but as he was lying in pain
    <br>on the hospital floor, someone directed him to The SCOAN. And just receiving that touch,
    <br>that prayer in the power of the Holy Spirit, the pain disappeared, the growth started reducing
    <br>and then completely shot inside and today he is restored and free to the glory of God.
    <br>One more time, let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>What is your word of advice to our viewers all over the world and those who are present here?
    <br>My advice to viewers all over the world and those watching me here
    <br>is that anyone who has a problem like this should still have faith and hope.
    <br>Believe that Jesus heals all manner of sickness and disease.
    <br>Jesus heals so you should have the faith that the Lord can heal anyone.
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ one more time.
    <br>Finally, let's just hear a quick word from your mother as well.
    <br>Madam, you are welcome, in Jesus' name.
    <br>What can you say about what Jesus Christ has done in the life of your son?
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Praise Master Jesus!
    <br>I'm coming here today to share my testimony! I give glory to God!
    <br>Mr Friday Matthew Igbaifua & Mother - Healed of Anus Cancer in Jesus' Name
    <br>This is just our mother's way of expressing her appreciation to God,
    <br>knowing that He has really rescued her son's life from the jaws of death.
    <br>We thank God for your life, mama. So what can you say about what Jesus has done for your son?
    <br>I thank the God of T. B. Joshua that delivered my son.
    <br>My son has said everything! I give glory to God, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen. Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So we thank God for what God has done in this family and we pray that God will give you
    <br>the grace to continue to make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and we know that the best is yet to come as you do so, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Mr Friday Matthew Igbaifua & Mother - Healed of Anus Cancer in Jesus' Name
