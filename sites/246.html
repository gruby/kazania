    <br>You Are A Faith Man | Powerful Message From T.B. Joshua
    <br>What a blessing to know for sure that no matter how you feel,
    <br>God says, faith is something you already have.
    <br>A man may be poor and yet be a friend of God.
    <br>You Are A Faith Man | Powerful Message From T.B. Joshua
    <br>You can be sick in body and yet be a favourite, a candidate of Heaven.
    <br>When the rich sees a poor man, he says, "Look at this man - it is as a result of his sin".
    <br>When those who have good health a see sick one, they say, "He is sick; he has committed sin."
    <br>You Are A Faith Man | Powerful Message From T.B. Joshua
    <br>Jesus says that faith is something I already have; it is a gift of God.
    <br>It is never proper to base faith on our improvement after prayer
    <br>because that trouble you have may be to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>If you are asking God to heal you, you are just disturbing yourself.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to prepare you for the challenges ahead.
    <br>It may be to stop you awhile in order to preserve you, prepare you, strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>It may be to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>It may be...
    <br>You Are A Faith Man | Powerful Message From T.B. Joshua
    <br>"In the name of Jesus... I want to move this mountain." - but the mountain is still there.
    <br>If I stand and say, "Whether God heals me or not, He is my Healer.
    <br>Whether God delivers me or not, He is my Deliverer. Whether God..."
    <br>You Are A Faith Man | Powerful Message From T.B. Joshua
    <br>You say, "I need healing. I have headache";
    <br>after the prayer the headache still persists ...
    <br>Whether God heals you or not, He is the Healer.
    <br>Whether God blesses you or not, whether God delivers you or not, He is my Deliverer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>"It honours Him to believe Him even while every sense contradicts Him."
    <br>You Are A Faith Man | Powerful Message From T.B. Joshua
    <br>To learn how to hear God after prayer is a much greater blessing than the healing.
    <br>When you are poor and anxiously in need of blessing,
    <br>you will not mind the source that supplies that blessing.
    <br>To learn how to hear from above after prayer
    <br>is a much greater blessing than what you are looking for.
    <br>You are looking for blessing, healing - you have not discovered this
    <br>because the prayer of faith can be repeated 10 000 times.
    <br>What is your covenant in God's Word?
    <br>My covenant in God's Word; Jesus is the Redeemer, whether He redeems me or not.
    <br>Jesus is the Deliverer, whether He delivers me or not - that is my confidence.
