  <p>    
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The message today...
    <br>Let's take a look at the Book of Luke 11:4.
    <br>Read along with me.
    <br>"... forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone..."
    <br>The word "everyone" - whether small or big - take note of that.
    <br>You say, "Oh my God, this is too much. I can forgive you, but this one is too much.
    <br>You must pay dearly for that."
    <br>But the Bible says, "... forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us."
    <br>Everyone!
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>In order to maintain our blessing, it says, "for we also forgive everyone..."
    <br>This is the condition.
    <br>- "Give me this bread."
    <br>- "You give me butter."
    <br>That is the condition.
    <br>If I give you bread, you must give me what?
    <br>But the case today is different.
    <br>We have not been playing our role.
    <br>It says, "Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us."
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>I wonder if many of us would want God to forgive us
    <br>in proportion to the way we have forgiven those who have offended us,
    <br>because the way we forgive others - 
    <br>the same way we will be forgiven.
    <br>Take note of that.
    <br>The way we forgive others - because we say "everyone"...
    <br>The way we forgive others - 
    <br>the same way we will be forgiven.
    <br>Don't forget, your forgiveness does not forget.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Don't forget, your forgiveness does not forget.
    <br>Anytime we see those who wronged us; this memory...
    <br>- "Hi!"
    <br>- "Hi!"
    <br>That's all.
    <br>Our forgiveness does not forget.
    <br>The woman is there - oh, it is better to let it go but you have forgiven her.
    <br>Our forgiveness does not forget.
    <br>The way we help others - 
    <br>the same way we will be helped.
    <br>In Matthew 25:45, it says that which you do to others, that you do to God -
    <br>how you restore, how you help, how you release, how you care for others.
    <br>How you restore others, how you release others from bondage,
    <br>how you restore others that need to be restored,
    <br>how you care, how you help others.
    <br>That which you do to others, that you do to God.
    <br>I want you to remember this.
    <br>You say, "I'll forgive."
    <br>If you have forgiven, God will forgive you.
    <br>It means your forgiveness does not forget.
    <br>"I've helped the man."
    <br>If you have helped the man, God will help you.
    <br>Don't forget, your help is for classic reasons, for selfish reasons and for material reasons.
    <br>Your help is for selfish, classic and material reasons.
    <br>Let's go to that Matthew 25.
    <br>Are your there?
    <br>Matthew 25:45.
    <br>"He will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these,
    <br>you did not do for me.' "
    <br>That which you do to your neighbour, to your fellow, that you do to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The manner you help others - the same manner you will be helped.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[The manner you help others - the same manner you will be helped.]
    <br>The way you forgive others - the same way you will be forgiven.
    <br>The way you care, you release others from bondage, from captivity -
    <br>the same way you will be released.
    <br>This is what we are going through.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "This is what you are going through."
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>I'm going through my own, I T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The manner I help you, I forgive you, I support you, I care for you,
    <br>the same way, the same manner...
    <br>This is what we are saying - with all my heart...
    <br>So, go and read the Lord's prayer:
    <br>Father, forgive us, as we forgive those who...
    <br>Who are those?
    <br>Others.
    <br>Our sickness is not like others'.
    <br>This is what we don't know.
    <br>We can have sickness, yes.
    <br>You can be sick but your sickness is not like others'.
    <br>We can face hardship but our hardship as a Christian is not like others'.
    <br>What makes the difference?
    <br>Our own sickness is to improve us, is to strengthen our desire and our determination for God
    <br>but others' is to impair them.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My sickness is not like others'."
    <br>My struggle is not like others'
    <br>because your own struggle makes you stronger but others'...
    <br>You say, "Christian doesn't have sickness, doesn't suffer..."
    <br>Our own sickness is not like others'.
    <br>So, you agree with me now:
    <br>You can be bold to say, "Yes, my sickness, my this, that..."
    <br>Your shortcoming is not like others'
    <br>because already you have been adopted by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Since you have been adopted, whatever happens to you cannot take your place;
    <br>you can only leave that place for a while but you still come back to the place.
    <br>"You are my biological child, yes.
    <br>Whatever you might have done cannot make you not to be my child.
    <br>It is correction."
    <br>You just need to be adopted by the Holy Ghost.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You need to be adopted.
    <br>Once you are adopted, whatever comes your way, you have a Helper.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I know the little message you received now is going to strengthen you.
    <br>Whatever you do to your neighbour, that you do to God.
    <br>You have to be very careful.
    <br>Whatever you want to give, give it with all your heart;
    <br>you are giving to God.
    <br>This is Christmas in the air, this is New Year in the air - the season to give, to share.
    <br>Whatever you want to do, do it with all your heart.
    <br>Do it with all your what?
    <br>Because you are doing it to who?
    <br>I don't want to know whether a person shares the same faith with you,
    <br>but the Bible says, "Everyone".
    <br>"Everyone" - whether they share the same faith with you or not.
    <br>Begin to think about this message.
    <br>The way I love others - the same way I will be loved.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "The way I love you - the same way I will be loved".
    <br>The way I help you - the same way I will be helped.
    <br>The way I release you - the same way I will be released.
    <br>The way I care for you - the same way I will be cared for.
    <br>- Hallelujah!
    <br>- [Amen!]
    <br>Can you make that your motto?
    <br>The way I love you - the same way I will be loved.
    <br>The way I help you - the same way I will be helped.
    <br>The way I release you - the same way I will be released.
    <br>The way I restore you - the same way I will be restored.
    <br>The way I care for you - the same way I will be cared for.
    <br>If you know that, life will be very wonderful to live.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What brought about this?
    <br>Simple - that Luke 11:4.
    <br>It says, "Forgive us, as we forgive those who..."
    <br>Help us, as we help those...
    <br>Care for us, as we...
    <br>Release us...
    <br>Restore us...
    <br>You don't want to say it along with me.
    <br>You have to start now.
    <br>You know, the Word of God I told you is a parable.
    <br>I read the Bible; I allow the Holy Spirit to carry me along when I read.
    <br>When I read the Bible, I am reading the Holy Spirit.
    <br>Say after me again,
    <br>"Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us."
    <br>Help us as we help those who need our help.
    <br>Care for us as we care for those who need our care.
    <br>Release us as we release those...
    <br>Could you boldly say this in the past?
    <br>How do you release others?
    <br>How do you restore people?
    <br>How do you help people?
    <br>How do you forgive people?
    <br>And if God returns back to you as you do to others -
    <br>you give people what you do not need -
    <br>if God were to give you what you do not need...
    <br>Those things you don't need; change you collected from the petrol station,
    <br>the car, the shoes, the wears - these are the things you give people.
    <br>Your time you do not need you give.
    <br>You say, "Love me as I love those who..." - oh my God - this is blasphemy.
    <br>This is what the Bible means, "Forgive us as we forgive those..."
    <br>When you are forgiven, help comes.
    <br>When you are forgiven, care comes.
    <br>When you are forgiven, restoration comes.
    <br>When you are forgiven, love comes.
    <br>The word forgiveness means care, restore, release, help - these are the meanings.
    <br>What is the meaning of forgiveness?
    <br>Can somebody tell me?
    <br>When you are forgiven, help, care, restoration, love come.
    <br>That is the meaning.
    <br>Forgiveness means restoration, help, care, love - that is the meaning.
    <br>This was what Jesus was referring to when He said, "Forgive us as we forgive."
    <br>It means, "Help us as we help others."
    <br>It means, "Care for us as we care for others."
    <br>It means, "Restore us as we restore others."
    <br>And you have not been doing well.
    <br>That is the meaning of forgiveness.
    <br>What is the meaning of forgiveness?
    <br>Help, care, restoration, love.
    <br>That is the meaning.
    <br>When the Bible says, "Forgive us as we forgive those who sin against us,"
    <br>it means help, love, care, restoration.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But the help you are giving to others is nothing to write home about.
    <br>And you have promised that God should give you in proportion of what you give to others.
    <br>That is why things are not working out.
    <br>That is why things are like this today,
    <br>the situation we have today, the help you receive today.
    <br>The care you receive today is as a result of the care you give.
    <br>This is why you are facing what you are facing.
    <br>Each time you give what you don't need, you have forgotten that you are giving to God.
    <br>The Bible says in Matthew 25:45, "That which you do to others, that you do to God."
    <br>When you meet others, you want to know their religion, faith they belong to before you help.
    <br>You meet others and say, "Are you this? Are you a member of this?"
    <br>What is your business of others?
    <br>They are an image of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you tell me how you will go about your life, after you are leaving here today?
    <br>What will you do about this message?
    <br>I need to help people the way I want them to help me.
    <br>- You want God to help you.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>That is all.
    <br>What you want God to do for you is what you should do to others.
    <br>Because it is written, "Forgive us as we forgive those..."
    <br>What will you do with this message, as you are going home?
    <br>As I'm going back home, I will care and help others to the extent I want God to help me.
    <br>Clap for her.
    <br>You have something to say?
    <br>When I go back home, I want to help people, the less privileged ones
    <br>and I want God to help me the way I help them.
    <br>Don't even bother to name the people you want to help;
    <br>you want to help people as you want God to help you, so you would do it justly.
    <br>This message is very important for you.
    <br>"My neighbours - they are 'God'."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "My neighbour, so you are 'God'?"
    <br>Face your neighbour and tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[My neighbour, so you are 'God'?]
    <br>Tell your neighbour again.
    <br>[My neighbour, so you are 'God'?]
    <br>That has answered all.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>That has answered it all.
    <br>Face your neighbour again, tell your neighbour.
    <br>[My neighbour, so you are 'God'?]
    <br>And you keep looking for God everywhere; inside the Bible you look for God,
    <br>you go to the mountain to look for God,
    <br>you go to Jerusalem to look for God,
    <br>in Bethlehem you look for God,
    <br>and you don't know that your neighbour is 'God'.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You go to the mountain, you fast 40 days 40 nights looking for God...
    <br>There is nothing you have not done to look for God.
    <br>Dream, dream, dream...
    <br>You don't know.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "So you are 'God'?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>A single sentence in the Bible solves it all.
    <br>It is not to read the Bible from paragraph to paragraph... - no.
    <br>A single sentence, "Forgive us as we forgive those who have offended us."
    <br>You have made a great promise to God.
    <br>Who has offended you?
    <br>Your neighbour.
    <br>Who has offended you?
    <br>Others.
    <br>Your quality time, what you cherish most - give it to your neighbour.
    <br>Take this message home.
    <br>"My neighbour, so you are 'God'?"
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>[My neighbour, so you are 'God'?]
    <br>Now, you know he is 'God' - you say, "Ah. OK."
    <br>You will not lie against your neighbour, you will not do anything unjust to your neighbour,
    <br>when you know you are doing it to God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Whatever you do to your neighbour, that you do to God.
    <br>The help you give to your neighbour, you give to God.
    <br>The care you give to your neighbour, you give to God.
    <br>Please, take this - let it be in your upper most place.
    <br>Your neighbour can be sleeping under the bridge, can be on the street, poor, rich...
    <br>Whatever you can do, "Hey, this is God. Seek God. The honour given to God."
    <br>Hallelujah!
