    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>Viewers, Good Morning And Win Today!
    <br>We are here with a different 'dimension'.
    <br>I want to say, Happy Palm Sunday!
    <br>I learnt there are questions and answers.
    <br>We believe those questions came from you.
    <br>We are going to answer one or two, which will bless all of us today.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>In fact, we have hundreds of questions from our viewers around the world.
    <br>We just want to pick a few of them, sir.
    <br>The first question, and many people have been asking this question, sir.
    <br>The question reads this:
    <br>Good Morning, Prophet T.B. Joshua. Why do we have a terrible time like this?
    <br>Terrible time like what?
    <br>Tell me.
    <br>The lockdown, virus, fear everywhere.
    <br>Terrible time like what?
    <br>The economic shutdown, people are not able to leave their homes,
    <br>people are afraid to go out into the community, they can't shake hands.
    <br>They are afraid of the sickness.
    <br>But you all wear makeup here.
    <br>I mean, you cannot be in a lockdown and wear makeup.
    <br>What do you want to say about it?
    <br>We are in the world but we are not part of the world.
    <br>OK.
    <br>You know I'm not a politician.
    <br>I just have to give you as the Spirit gave me
    <br>because I received this message four days ago from the Holy Spirit.
    <br>World leaders and scientists know what they are doing.
    <br>That is why they keep promoting fear and panic.
    <br>There is panic, there is fear everywhere.
    <br>They know what they have done.
    <br>Who do you think is promoting this fear and panic?
    <br>The world leaders.
    <br>If the world leaders say today, "Enough is enough" - all these deaths...
    <br>Before virus, there were deaths, a number of deaths
    <br>but they never mentioned the number of deaths to us before virus.
    <br>It is now we begin to count the number of deaths, instead of counting the number of lives.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>They know the gravity of the situation.
    <br>The whole thing has to do with error in advanced technology.
    <br>This is the only way I can put it because I'm not a scientist.
    <br>I repeat again:
    <br>The whole thing has to do with error, mistake in advanced technology.
    <br>Now, innocent people are dying, especially the elderly.
    <br>Now, it has become a crime to be old.
    <br>We cannot go near the elderly ones because of fear and panic.
    <br>This is the situation we find ourselves.
    <br>- You have elderly ones?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You know, I have the whole world of elderlies.
    <br>Because of fear and panic, it has become so difficult to near them.
    <br>Everyone is afraid.
    <br>Nothing is worth the blood of innocent people.
    <br>There is no acceptable excuse for doing this.
    <br>Now, they have seen what it means to be locked down in concentration camps.
    <br>This is an opportunity for our world leaders, our scientists
    <br>to look at the trouble spots in the world, e.g. Syria.
    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>This is an opportunity for our world leaders, our scientists
    <br>to look at the trouble spots in the world
    <br>so that the displaced people can return to their countries.
    <br>If not, I am seeing God's anger.
    <br>I will let you know the opinion of God, as time goes on.
    <br>I'm seeing God's anger.
    <br>Let us abide by what the Bible says in 2 Chronicles 7:14.
    <br>If you may read...
    <br>Those who are called by My name should humble themselves and pray and seek the face of God.
    <br>The Lord is ready to forgive them and heal their land.
    <br>Thank you very much, sir.
    <br>Don't let me go too far from my profession.
    <br>I am a minister of God; I am not a politician.
    <br>I should not go too far from my profession.
    <br>I should not speak what God has not asked me to say.
    <br>- OK?
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>I will leave the rest, but I will let you people know what is to come.
    <br>Thank you very much, sir, for your wisdom.
    <br>You said in your word that
    <br>by an attitude of faith and repentance we can receive God's mercy.
    <br>I mean, our will must be obedient to God's will before God can heal our land.
    <br>Once again, thank you very much, sir, for your wisdom.
    <br>We have a second question here from our viewers - I would like to read.
    <br>Man of God, we saw your prophecy where you said one day people would come to the church
    <br>and there would be no church service and people would meet you on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The first time you saw this, how did you prepare for that?
    <br>Did you do anything to stop it?
    <br>Why not?
    <br>Why wouldn't I do something?
    <br>You want them to close my church?
    <br>No.
    <br>What question is that?
    <br>Can you trace the person that sent this email to me?
    <br>- Or you framed it by yourself?
    <br>- No, sir.
    <br>Read it again.
    <br>What kind of question is this?
    <br>This is actually an email from the US.
    <br>Man of God, we saw your prophecy where you said one day people would come to the church
    <br>and there would be no church service and people would meet you on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>The first time you saw this, how did you prepare for that?
    <br>Did you do anything to stop it?
    <br>Given the importance of church services,
    <br>we prayed to know God's opinion but it was unchangeable.
    <br>The whole thing was unchangeable.
    <br>I am a servant.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>PROPHECY! PROPHECY! PROPHECY!
    <br>WHEN GOD'S SERVANT SPEAKS FORTH THE WISE LISTEN
    <br>DEUTERONOMY 18:22
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On Sunday, 24th of February 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic message
    <br>about a vision God had given him concerning The SCOAN service.
    <br>These were his words.
    <br>The thing God is still telling me -
    <br>you will just get here one day, you will learn that there is no church.
    <br>Please, meet me on Emmanuel TV - no church.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, you'll meet me on Emmanuel TV talking to you,
    <br>or when there is a revival, you'll see me.
    <br>So, we have to be serious.
    <br>On Sunday, 7th April 2019, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied further
    <br>about the vision he had seen regarding the church service at The SCOAN.
    <br>This is what he said.
    <br>You know, I told you people of recent:
    <br>You may be here, you'll learn that there is no service - close the church.
    <br>You will meet us on Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Now, we are in a perilous time - a very difficult time.
    <br>Hear what is happening all over the world.
    <br>Fearful year!
    <br>A lot happened and our protection is God.
    <br>On Sunday, 5th January 2020, for the third time, Prophet T.B. Joshua once again prophesied
    <br>about what he saw would happen this year concerning The SCOAN service.
    <br>This is what he said.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I am so concerned about what is going to happen this year - so much concerned than anything.
    <br>If it's going to cause me to close the church and find out what is going to happen -
    <br>because everywhere is fear.
    <br>If something wants to catch you, it should not catch you unprepared.
    <br>You don't mind but I am very, very concerned.
    <br>That was why we started preparing where we can reach our viewers all over the world.
    <br>That brought about the studio we are in today.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>In the same vein, we saw the attacks in South Africa
    <br>and we told the nation, South Africa what was to come.
    <br>Where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>When I realised there was nothing we could do to avert this attack,
    <br>we had to move the Emmanuel TV broadcasting centre from Johannesburg to Germany.
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>PROPHECY! PROPHECY! PROPHECY!
    <br>WHEN GOD'S SERVANT SPEAKS FORTH THE WISE LISTEN
    <br>DEUTERONOMY 18:22
    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On Sunday, 28th July, 2013, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophetic warning to the nation of South Africa
    <br>concerning a serious revolt led by youth which would cost lives.
    <br>These were his words:
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>In the nation, South Africa, we should help them in prayer because I'm seeing youth revolt.
    <br>It will be very serious.
    <br>A situation where youth will come out and begin...
    <br>You learn that there is a protest here.
    <br>Some people were killed - certain people.
    <br>Revolt.
    <br>In South Africa.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>What a man of vision.
    <br>As you mentioned, sir,
    <br>as the Bible says in Proverbs 29:18, where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>- We have one more question.
    <br>- Take your question.
    <br>This viewer is asking a question many have asked in the past.
    <br>I always watch Emmanuel TV but going back to your humble beginnings:
    <br>There were two places we saw - a prayer room and a hut.
    <br>The question is: Was that how you started your ministry?
    <br>You must have seen what you were to become to have endured staying in those places.
    <br>If you had not seen ahead,
    <br>it seems unlikely that you would have been able to sleep in a hut like that.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>If I don't know where I am going, I would have given up a long time ago.
    <br>Are you talking of the persecution of your generation?
    <br>Are you talking of attack - there and then?
    <br>Because I know where I am going.
    <br>I know behind those attacks, there is future.
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua did not have a vehicle to move around.
    <br>He walked almost everywhere he went for two years.
    <br>The children surrounding Prophet T.B. Joshua were among those he gathered to follow him,
    <br>as he went to form the first Synagogue Church Of All Nations.
    <br>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH TB JOSHUA!!!
    <br>This is the first site and the first structure of The SCOAN,
    <br>where Prophet T.B. Joshua having just returned from the prayer mountain lays the foundation of the church,
    <br>located in Agodo-Egbe, Lagos, Nigeria.
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua walks joyfully among the members, as he lifts their faith with the Word of God.
    <br>Amen!
    <br>In fact, I don't know where to start.
    <br>My coming into your midst is just to lay a foundation.
    <br>Today, we start the Synagogue here!
    <br>1989
    <br>1st Church
    <br>EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH TB JOSHUA!!!
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua's Humble Beginning
    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>So, back to your question.
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>If something big starts big, it calls for concern.
    <br>Everything big starts little.
    <br>If something big starts big, it calls for concern.
    <br>That is my case.
    <br>There is time for everything - time to be born and time to grow,
    <br>time to face persecution and time to reap the fruit of your labour.
    <br>What am I saying?
    <br>Time for everything, sir.
    <br>Any life that does not follow this process is bound to face obstacles.
    <br>When I say obstacle - something that can either stop you or destroy you.
    <br>This is what is happening all over the world today.
    <br>Something that can either stop you or destroy you.
    <br>You can see many futures being destroyed, many futures being stopped.
    <br>The journey - the processing.
    <br>It's not what we become but how we become it.
    <br>It's not what you achieve but how you achieve 'them' that matters.
    <br>- You know soup?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Soup does not matter, but the ingredients of soup.
    <br>If one is missing, you feel it in the taste of the soup.
    <br>That is career.
    <br>Any life that does not follow this process is bound to face obstacles
    <br>in the middle of the journey or late on the journey of life.
    <br>This is what is happening all over the world to men and women.
    <br>Even to us in the ministry.
    <br>Are you talking of other professional domains?
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>We must take note of the time of planting,
    <br>time of growing, time of facing persecution
    <br>and time of showing the proceeds of your labour.
    <br>Time for everything.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Yes.
    <br>If you do not know how to maintain the little of today,
    <br>you may not know how to maintain the big of tomorrow.
    <br>Don't forget you were once a tiny embryo in your mother's womb; see how big you have become today.
    <br>If faith must grow, it must start little.
    <br>Today,
    <br>just altar call - you are born again.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You start speaking in tongues.
    <br>Just altar call - you start stretching hands.
    <br>It's true.
    <br>Just mere becoming a graduate - you become a millionaire.
    <br>You want a vehicle, you want to get married because you are a graduate.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>This was the case of our Lord Jesus Christ and Nicodemus in John 3.
    <br>Viewers, thank you.
    <br>- Am I OK with you?
    <br>- Yes. I think they will be very happy.
    <br>- It is like you are forgetting yourself.
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>Did you not start little?
    <br>I started very little - embryo in the mother's womb.
    <br>Are you sure you started your career little?
    <br>I think I was a little embryo at the beginning.
    <br>- What of you? You started big?
    <br>- No, sir.
    <br>It reminds me of one of your messages where you said,
    <br>we must value processing more than the results.
    <br>Give me five.
    <br>Viewers...
    <br>Thank you very much, sir.
    <br>We know, to become God's person, we must follow His processing.
    <br>Thank you very much, sir.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>We have more questions, sir. We want to tap in to this wisdom, sir.
    <br>And I want to be with my viewers, pray with them.
    <br>- Just one or more two, sir.
    <br>- Another question?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>This one is very interesting, sir.
    <br>The viewer writes, "Dear Prophet T.B. Joshua, may I ask you..."
    <br>Dear Prophet T.B. Joshua, instead of "Dear T.B. Joshua".
    <br>Listen - "Dear Prophet T.B. Joshua" - can you write a letter to Prophet?
    <br>The letter should be to T.B. Joshua.
    <br>T.B. Joshua - human.
    <br>Prophet - divine.
    <br>Change this.
    <br>Viewers, "Dear T.B. Joshua" not "Dear Prophet T.B. Joshua".
    <br>You can't send a letter to Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>You can't do that.
    <br>So viewers, when you are writing an email to T.B. Joshua;
    <br>our gentleman here wrote "Dear Prophet T.B. Joshua"
    <br>but you cannot address Prophet, you can only address mister.
    <br>So, I will correct it for our brother that sent the email.
    <br>Dear T.B. Joshua, may I ask you a question? How does the Word of God work for you?
    <br>I'm asking this because I see you heal, bless, deliver with the Word of God.
    <br>So, how does it work for you, sir?
    <br>Let me read.
    <br>Dear Mr T.B. Joshua, how does the Word of God work for you?
    <br>It is very interesting, sir.
    <br>The Word of God works for us when we meditate on what we read in the Bible
    <br>and turn it over and over and over again in our heart.
    <br>What does that mean - to turn something over and over and over again in our heart?
    <br>It means your heart is the one reading, not you.
    <br>Heart can read, heart can look.
    <br>When I say heart, I mean your spirit.
    <br>The more your spirit acts upon the Word,
    <br>the more the Word grows and gains supremacy over you, authority over you.
    <br>"Let that be. Go this way. Go that way."
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Viewers, signs and wonders will not happen until the Spirit and the Word join together.
    <br>They are inseparable.
    <br>The Word is not complete without the Spirit and the Spirit is not complete without the Word.
    <br>This means the Spirit lightens the Word.
    <br>Let me give you a good example.
    <br>This is the Word;
    <br>this is the Spirit lighting the Word.
    <br>The Spirit will be released to the degree we stand in reverence, in honour of His Word.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>Let me give you a good example:
    <br>When I say, "Be healed" - people want to know what the meaning of this is.
    <br>When we say, "Be Healed,"
    <br>for Jesus to come to the scene, for Jesus to hear us,
    <br>the command must be released by the Spirit of God.
    <br>"Be healed" - the command must be released by the Spirit of God
    <br>because the Spirit makes us to know that believing is possessing.
    <br>"Let there be light!" - there is light.
    <br>The belief in our heart is released by faith out of our mouth.
    <br>Our brother will be very happy, sir.
    <br>The Word speaks His promises while the Spirit executes them.
    <br>Maybe that will be clear to you.
    <br>God moves through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>In order to be born again, one must be born again by the Word and Spirit.
    <br>If you are born again by the Word, you are not yet born again until the Spirit executes it.
    <br>Thank you, sir. This sheds more light on the message you taught us earlier, that
    <br>the Holy Bible cannot work alone; God's Spirit makes it work.
    <br>Holy men were carried along by the Spirit as they spoke the Word that came from God.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>I don't know if we have time for one more question from our viewers, sir.
    <br>- One more?
    <br>- One more.
    <br>This person writes:
    <br>Dear Mr T.B. Joshua, do you sometimes fall ill?
    <br>If so, whenever you are ill, do you pray for yourself?
    <br>This is another temptation.
    <br>This is another one.
    <br>Why do you want to know this?
    <br>Because the viewers love me so much,
    <br>they want to know how they can care for me.
    <br>They want to know in what other ways they can support me.
    <br>Let's take our Bible.
    <br>Sunday Broadcast
    <br>From The Emmanuel TV Studios
    <br>OK, this is 2 Corinthians 5, I will take my reading from verse 1.
    <br>Awaiting the new body:
    <br>"For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed,
    <br>we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands."
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What are they trying to say there?
    <br>My outward part, the shell, sometimes falls ill but once it is time for assignment, I am relieved.
    <br>When the assignments finish, the pain may reoccur.
    <br>May we ask what type of illness you are talking about?
    <br>That's tiredness.
    <br>What would be the cause of this tiredness?
    <br>When I need to rest - I just need to rest.
    <br>Work pressures.
    <br>What would be the way out, sir?
    <br>The way out is to just rest - sufficient rest.
    <br>When I leave here, I need to go and rest and rest and rest...
    <br>If you viewers allow me to rest.
    <br>Yes, sir, as you said, rest time is for receiving. Work time is for giving.
    <br>Time in Christ's service requires time out for renewal.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Those whom God calls for any service, He makes them fit for it.
    <br>We thank God, sir.
    <br>We really appreciate the wisdom you have shared
    <br>and we want to thank our viewers as well for submitting these questions.
    <br>We want to encourage our viewers - continue to send more questions,
    <br>as by God's grace we will have the opportunity to hear more from you.
    <br>Viewers, they ask you to send more questions, and you want me to rest.
    <br>You are asking me if I used to be ill,
    <br>but you are now giving me more questions, and you are asking me whether I used to be sick.
    <br>So, see you next time.
    <br>GOOD MORNING & WIN TODAY
    <br>Let us not forget our message for the partners.
    <br>This is an important message for the Emmanuel TV partners around the world.
