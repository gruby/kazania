    <br>GOD IS STILL SAYING SOMETHING
    <br>On Sunday 11th February 2018, Prophet T.B. Joshua gave a prophecy
    <br>concerning the battles the world would face in the coming months.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>From January to July is battle - the whole world;
    <br>economic battle, leadership battle and this battle will continue 'til July.
    <br>By July we'll begin to see some flame of difference.
    <br>You have not seen anything; this is just February.
    <br>Like my country - by May 16th, write it down.
    <br>I will tell you what will happen.
    <br>From May 14th, I will tell you what will happen.
