  <p>    
    <br>Anywhere you are, distance is not a barrier.
    <br>Viewers, you are called to battle the spiritual entities, which cause crisis in your life.
    <br>You and Prophet T.B. Joshua together, in the name of Jesus,
    <br>can stop satan from killing, stealing, and destroying your life.
    <br>Touch the screen right now and engage with God!
    <br>Viewers at home, where can we go from His presence?
    <br>In the East, South, West and North - nowhere.
    <br>Viewers, listen to me.
    <br>God's Word is the final authority settling all matters,
    <br>settling all troubles, challenges, situations.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in, never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Never a disease Jesus cannot cure.
    <br>Never a burden Jesus cannot bear.
    <br>Never a trouble Jesus cannot solve.
    <br>God's Word settles all matters.
    <br>Come on! Let us settle your matter.
    <br>Whatever challenge confronting you,
    <br>whatever situation confronting you,
    <br>whatever trouble confronting you,
    <br>be exposed and be delivered, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be exposed and be free in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be free, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Viewers at home, let your heart be fixed and established in the Word of God.
    <br>The Word of God is living.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, I rescue you!
    <br>Be rescued!
    <br>In the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever area of your life, I rescue you, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>I rescue you, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Confess your freedom now.
    <br>Confess you're freedom.
    <br>Say, "In the name of Jesus, I am free"
    <br>In the name of Jesus, I am delivered.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, I am rescued.
    <br>Let there be light in my business, career, finances.
    <br>Say, "Let there be light!"
    <br>I bear witness to your breakthrough.
    <br>Breakthrough in your business!
    <br>Breakthrough in your career!
    <br>Breakthrough in your finances!
    <br>Breakthrough!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit and pray to meet you there again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God as you send your testimony.
    <br>Engage with God.
