    <br>Standard For Life
    <br>During a Monday live prophetic service, Prophet T.B. Joshua was ministering the prayer of faith to the congregation,
    <br>placing his hands on them in the name of Jesus Christ to break every generational curse off their lives
    <br>and rewrite their family history.
    <br>As the man of God was praying, this woman began to react strangely and cried out to the prophet.
    <br>The devil is using the Bible to torment me.
    <br>I carry the Bible anywhere I go.
    <br>How does the devil use the Bible to torment you?
    <br>Before I can talk to you, I have to read the Bible.
    <br>Unless my husband siezes the Bible from me,
    <br>I would read my Bible before I answer you.
    <br>I would open the Bible and read it before doing anything.
    <br>Even if I want to buy something, I would open the Bible
    <br>to determine from which person I should buy the item
    <br>or before I know which item to buy.
    <br>This is the Bible.
    <br>Is this the very Bible?
    <br>I have destroyed up to six Bibles by doing this.
    <br>How does the devil use the Bible?
    <br>When I am going out, I put the Bible in my bag and would look at my Bible in my bag.
    <br>It makes me to behave abnormally.
    <br>People would be looking at me strangely.
    <br>I would carry it by my side, even in the house when I am cooking.
    <br>Even if I want to wash plates, I would ask the Bible, "Should I wash plates?"
    <br>Who do you ask?
    <br>I would ask the Bible.
    <br>What would you ask the Bible?
    <br>I would ask the Bible whether I should wash plates or do something else.
    <br>How do you do it?
    <br>If there are two plates, I would ask which plate I should wash first.
    <br>I would open the Bible. It says, "And the Lord said unto Moses,
    <br>"Take all the curse of the people."
    <br>If I was asking about this plate, I know I must wash the other plate first.
    <br>Then I would leave the first plate. After washing the second plate, I would continue with the first plate.
    <br>Here are two bags and you want to go out,
    <br>but you don't know which bag to carry, so ask!
    <br>I would pray, "Oh Lord, open my eyes.
    <br>Which one of these bags should I carry? Is it this one?"
    <br>"His glory is like the firstling of the bullock,
    <br>and his horns are like the horns of unicorns."
    <br>Then I would know.
    <br>What did that one say about this bag?
    <br>It was positive concerning this bag.
    <br>What are you going to do now?
    <br>I will carry this bag and start going where I want to go.
    <br>When you are going out, will you not ask before you go?
    <br>I will ask. I will put the Bible in my bag after praying.
    <br>Be going and do what you used to do.
    <br>As I am going I would ask the Bible, "Should I follow this way?"
    <br>Can DEMONS Use The BIBLE???
    <br>If I am going to the market and maybe I want to buy ogbono
    <br>and two people are selling ogbono, I would ask, "Should I buy ogbono from this woman?"
    <br>Then I would open the Bible.
    <br>The woman would not know?
    <br>At times, people who are fast may know.
    <br>"And Amon had a friend and his name was Jonathan,
    <br>the son of David's brother and Jonathan was a subtle man."
    <br>Because it says that Jonathan was a subtle man,
    <br>I should not buy from this woman.
    <br>From what you have read now, there is nothing to show
    <br>whether you should buy or not.
    <br>What I read said that Jonathan was a subtle man,
    <br>that is somebody who is very crafty.
    <br>What would happen to the woman?
    <br>I would not buy from her.
    <br>How does this affect your life?
    <br>It has affected my life.
    <br>As I carry the Bible, people would look at me and this makes me behave abnormally.
    <br>At times, as I am walking on the road, I may not know that vehicles and machines are coming.
    <br>I would be busy opening the Bible.
    <br>Come.
    <br>Did you ask whether you should come here?
    <br>Do it.
    <br>I prayed and asked God whether I should come to The SCOAN.
    <br>When I opened the Bible, I read, 'Fear not', and then I came to The SCOAN.
    <br>Open it here now.
    <br>God, should I go The SCOAN?
    <br>"And the Lord put a Word in Balaam's mouth and said,
    <br>Return to Balak and thou shall speak."
    <br>But there is no "Fear not" there.
    <br>No, that was what I read before coming here.
    <br>This one is speaking positively.
    <br>Can DEMONS Use The BIBLE???
    <br>How did you start this thing?
    <br>When one of my colleagues came to my house.
    <br>She told me that sometimes when she wanted to do something
    <br>she would open the Bible and read and she showed me how to do it.
    <br>I started doing it and it was working for me but I was not doing it often.
    <br>Before, it was working for you.
    <br>It is still working for me.
    <br>Okay, it is still working for you. Why do you want to disconnect yourself?
    <br>It is tormenting me.
    <br>Something that is working for you is now tormenting you?
    <br>Yes, because people see me behaving abnormally.
    <br>Even in the yard, I would carry Bible up and down.
    <br>People would see me because I don't hide it anymore.
    <br>You don't want to carry a Bible up and down?
    <br>Not this way. I want to preach the Gospel but not this way.
    <br>It started almost ten years ago but it became serious three years ago.
    <br>It's alright. What can you say about your wife?
    <br>All night long, she would be wandering everywhere with the Bible.
    <br>She used to throw some property out.
    <br>Whenever she opened this Bible, she would move property from one side to
    <br>the other and she would throw some property out of the house.
    <br>She would also get angry and cannot stay with people.
    <br>Can DEMONS Use The BIBLE???
    <br>What voice do you normally hear?
    <br>Death, death, death. That's why I carry the Bible if I want to do anything.
    <br>Most of the time, when I wanted to do something, the voice would be telling
    <br>me that I would die or another person would die.
    <br>Before this time, even now, when you sleep, there is a strange man
    <br>who normally comes to you.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>You know, you don't have affection for your husband.
    <br>You are very correct, sir.
    <br>That man is your husband. There was a time they wanted to ordain you.
    <br>You need to be delivered. You have a spiritual husband.
    <br>Your spiritual husband began to use whatever is around you.
    <br>Like I used to say, this is the Bible. You cannot buy the holiness of it.
    <br>Everybody has access to it. That is why in an occultic place they use the book.
    <br>It is a book now. It becomes a Bible  when the holiness comes.
    <br>You can buy this one in the market but the holiness in it is not for sale.
    <br>She is carrying the book without its holiness.
    <br>Don't let it surprise or bother you that someone could use the Bible like this.
    <br>Anybody can lay his hands on this; you can buy the Bible anywhere.
    <br>That is a book. This is for everyone but the holiness of it is for the chosen ones.
    <br>Having explained that all the lady really needed was a thorough deliverance,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua prays for her in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>and the Deliverer Himself, our Lord Jesus steps into her case and makes an immediate difference,
    <br>delivering her in the power of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>In Jesus' name. Amen. Stand up.
    <br>She rises to her feet and the prophet touches her eyes
    <br>as the power of deliverance continues to break every hidden agenda of the devil off her life.
    <br>That idea has gone.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, I am delivered.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Mrs Ngozi Agilo.
    <br>I am an immigration officer.
    <br>The man standing beside me is my husband.
    <br>I want to testify to the goodness of the Lord and
    <br>to thank Him for what He has done for me.
    <br>I was addicted to this book.
    <br>Anywhere I wanted to go, I used to carry this book everywhere.
    <br>Whatever I wanted to do, I would first of all inquire from this book
    <br>to find out what to do.
    <br>The answer I got would enable me to know what to do.
    <br>Whether in the market or in the house, anywhere, along the road,
    <br>anywhere I went, I must open this book to find out what to do.
    <br>Sometimes when I wanted to go to the toilet, even the kitchen,
    <br>I would open it and find out.
    <br>When you wanted to go to the toilet...
    <br>When I wanted to go to the toilet, I would inquire
    <br>whether I should go and now or wait.
    <br>If I inquired and it was negative, I would hold myself; I would not go.
    <br>If you inquired and the report was negative, you would hold yourself?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What if you were pressed?
    <br>If I really needed to go, I would still hold it.
    <br>After some time, I would inquire again, whether I should go.
    <br>I think, this is the problem with you and your husband.
    <br>Sometimes, your husband would want you but you would ask your book. And your book would say 'no'.
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Sometimes, when my husband wanted me to do something,
    <br>I would first of all inquire before I would do that thing.
    <br>If he wanted to meet me as husband and wife, I would tell him to wait
    <br>for me to inquire.
    <br>Can DEMONS Use The BIBLE???
    <br>You know the reason I asked this question? Because I knew this question is in the mind of everybody.
    <br>But you can't come out and ask. Assume I did not ask this question, they would send me long emails.
    <br>Some people would even abuse me - why I did not ask this question?
    <br>Did you used to ask, when you were going to work?
    <br>No, as an immigration officer, I don't normally inquire.
    <br>Because she knows they will sack her.
    <br>She doesn't ask before going to work but she can ask anything. Can you see now?
    <br>In the office, I would inquire where to sit and where not to sit.
    <br>At the working place? You would ask what?
    <br>Where to be or where not to be.
    <br>Since last Monday, how life has been?
    <br>I read my Bible normally now.
    <br>There is nothing like that again? Thank you very much.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Mr Agilo.
    <br>Can you just tell us your experiences so far, after the deliverance, with your wife?
    <br>Have you been seeing your wife still using the book the way she had been using it before?
    <br>After the man of God laid hands upon my wife last Monday,
    <br>everything changed for the better.
    <br>She has been behaving well since then.
    <br>Now, she's free.
    <br>She's delivered.
