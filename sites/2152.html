    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>Life is full of imitation.
    <br>This is why we are very limited in our thinking,
    <br>in our doings and in our ways.
    <br>We are very limited.
    <br>We can't go beyond.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>When you are a type that copies,
    <br>you base your life on copying.
    <br>And there is so much weakness in copying.
    <br>You can imagine how many business cards you have in your pocket -
    <br>you are the architect, you are the the lawyer,
    <br>you are the accountant.
    <br>You are this because you don't know what to do again - you copy.
    <br>Each time you see someone who is prosperous in his career,
    <br>you abandon your career and jump into that career.
    <br>And prosperity is not evidence that you are called.
    <br>You can be rich in doing what you are doing and yet you are not called for that job from Heaven.
    <br>No! You can be very rich in what you are doing and yet it is not your calling from Heaven.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>The end will prove that it is your calling.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The end will prove that what I am doing is my calling from God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: Don't be afraid. The end will prove that what you are doing is your calling from God.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>If there's nothing like that, people like me,
    <br>where would I be today?
    <br>This is inherited from the Apostles.
    <br>The price they paid is what I am enjoying today.
    <br>So, the price you are paying - children yet unborn also will live to enjoy them.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>This is why we say the world is coming to an end,
    <br>because everyone is copying.
    <br>No one is patient enough to wait for God,
    <br>to hear from God.
    <br>You copy little things.
    <br>Even in the world today, they encourage copying.
    <br>When your children want to sit for an exam, they give an opportunity for 'first choice' and 'second choice'.
    <br>So, alternative everywhere.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>It will be too soon for you to say, "This is my calling.
    <br>What I'm doing is what I'm called from Heaven to do". No.
    <br>The beginner is not the owner, but the finisher.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: The beginner is not the owner of the job, but the finisher.
    <br>When you start well you begin to run faster
    <br>and someone has been struggling to get to you.
    <br>But before getting to the end where you can receive an award,  you suddenly fall down.
    <br>And the one that was coming with effort passes you.
    <br>He will be the one to receive the award.
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>The issue of faith is an issue we should critically look into and see how it really affects your life.
    <br>Are you living by faith?
    <br>Are you a faith man?
    <br>If you continue to copy and you are not patient enough to listen to God for direction,
    <br>you will go well and still come back to where you started.
    <br>This is why you see people 'up' and 'down'.
    <br>Everything in life is so epileptic today -
    <br>[ 'up' and 'down' ]
    <br>BE AN IMITATOR OF GOD
    <br>A copy cannot stand the test of time.
    <br>This is why when challenges come,
    <br>you lament and complain.
    <br>Challenges will come,
    <br>but a copy man cannot stand the challenges.
    <br>Who is the master of the copy?
    <br>Man is the master of the copy,
    <br>but the Master of the original is God.
