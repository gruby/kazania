    <br>Those unyielding prayers - you have been praying, fasting -
    <br>as from today, you can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens you.
    <br>Say, I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me,
    <br>in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Not that you deserve it but Jesus anoints those who He chooses to anoint.
    <br>He chose you today!
    <br>You are a chosen one!
    <br>Tell your neighbour: I don't deserve it; He decided to choose me.
    <br>He chooses whom He chooses; He loves whom He loves.
    <br>I am anointed today, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>WATCH THIS And Feel GOD’S PRESENCE!!!
    <br>Stretch your hand forward!
    <br>Begin to lay your hand right now -
    <br>the anointed hand, the right hand of God!
    <br>Those who are with us, those who are for us, pray with us!
    <br>Stretch your hand! You will feel the vibration, presence of God
    <br>as it should be, by divine will, in Jesus' name!
    <br>Say, as it should be, by divine will!
    <br>Something divine cannot be ordinary.
    <br>If it were ordinary, you are not qualified.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Something divine cannot be ordinary."
    <br>If it were ordinary, if it were your brother, if it were T.B. Joshua
    <br>that is giving it, he may not give me.
    <br>But God chooses as He wills.
    <br>WATCH THIS And Feel GOD’S PRESENCE!!!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>Every hand that participated, be anointed!
    <br>Every tongue that participated, be anointed!
    <br>Every hand!
    <br>The right hand of God is power!
    <br>Say, "The right hand of God is power!"
    <br>Say, tongue!
    <br>I have received a tongue to loose and bind, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>As the mass prayer was conducted by Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>thousands of people received instant healing.
    <br>One particular lady - miraculously the Holy Spirit flushed out of her body a fibroid,
    <br>while praying along with Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>When the power of God is present, healing is like breathing,
    <br>deliverance is like breathing and breakthrough is like breathing,
    <br>when the power of God is present.
    <br>The age of miracles has not passed.
    <br>The miracle-worker is still alive.
    <br>His name is Jesus Christ.
    <br>Viewers all over the world, let's watch.
    <br>Look at the screen of your television.
    <br>This is the woman who has come today with the problem of multiple fibroids.
    <br>While the prayer was going on by the man of God, the fibroids started coming out of her body.
    <br>Fibroid Growths Bursting
    <br>Whatever that is not of God; when you leave from here and go to the restroom,
    <br>you will begin to defecate what is not part of your life.
    <br>What is the trouble in your business?
    <br>You will use your mouth to loose and to bind it.
    <br>Your finances will be reinstated.
    <br>Your marriage will be restructured.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>I'm happy for your life.
