    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>Offering the prayer of faith in accordance with the book of James 5:16 and Acts 4:30,
    <br>Wise Man Daniel is used as an instrument of deliverance in the hands of the Holy Spirit.
    <br>As he is moved through the auditorium, on meeting this man, the fire of the Holy Ghost falls upon him,
    <br>and the demonic entity behind his setback and affliction is exposed and arrested.
    <br>Witness this inspiring deliverance as this man encounters Wise Man Daniel.
    <br>Can you speak? Who are you?
    <br>I am the idols of his father's house.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>I am killing him little by little.
    <br>You are killing him little by little?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>He is a preacher of the Gospel.
    <br>He is a preacher of the Gospel?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>What have you done to him?
    <br>He is a stubborn person; we have decided to frustrate him.
    <br>For four hundred and something years, we have been in his father's house.
    <br>He decided to break the yoke by becoming the first born-again.
    <br>He has been a thorn in our flesh.
    <br>We are from the kingdom, the sanctum of darkness.
    <br>That is where we come from.
    <br>He gathered some people and they came to his father's house to trouble us.
    <br>While they were praying, his prayer was different and so,
    <br>we decided that we are going to disgrace him by frustrating him.
    <br>In the beginning of his life when he wanted to get married, we delivered a wife unto him.
    <br>He is a man who likes beautiful women, so we gave him a beautiful woman.
    <br>We gave the woman a heart of stone, so that whatsoever he does or says would not appeal to her.
    <br>We decided to fight him from the inside.
    <br>He is an associate pastor.
    <br>He has gone from one ministry to the other.
    <br>We decided that we would frustrate him and all his ventures.
    <br>From one place to another, we have always been tele-guiding him.
    <br>But he has always been praying and asking God when this affliction would be over.
    <br>His father and forefathers have dedicated him, even before his birth.
    <br>Every time, his father renews the covenant we have with him.
    <br>All the other children of his father are still in our captivity.
    <br>But this one has been stubborn towards us.
    <br>He still wants to deliver the rest of his brothers.
    <br>He led his mother to Christ and we are not happy about that.
    <br>He is also working hard to make sure that his father departs from our kingdom but we are saying, "No".
    <br>If we don’t destroy him from the inside, we will never get him.
    <br>But we don’t know how he managed to locate this place.
    <br>What is wrong with this place that you don’t like?
    <br>Everybody knows what is wrong with this place.
    <br>The fires are too much.
    <br>Deliverance at the SCOAN
    <br>What does the fire do to your kingdom?
    <br>Immediately your hand touched his head, you ignited the fire that was quenched before and
    <br>strong roots of our tree inside him began to fall.
    <br>The fire is too much.
    <br>We tried to frustrate him this morning not to come, igniting a quarrel between him and his wife this morning
    <br>so that he would not be able to come here.
    <br>Were you sleeping when he came here?
    <br>We didn’t know it was going to work out.
    <br>A mighty hand held his wrist and drew him into this place against our wish.
    <br>Which hand was that?
    <br>We don’t know where the hand came from but we know that hand is a very strong hand.
    <br>Does it mean you people cannot resist that hand?
    <br>The hand is so strong and looks like the hand of a great lion.
    <br>There is fire in the fingers of the lion.
    <br>When the hand held him, we were surprised because it was a strange appearance.
    <br>Right now, it is time you go.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Out, you demon!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Come out, in the mighty name of Jesus!
    <br>You are going.
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>You are delivered. Rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you, sir?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>What happened to you, sir?
    <br>I have never fallen on the ground before. I am a pastor.
    <br>I am surprised.
    <br>You don’t know what pushed you down?
    <br>I don’t know. I know I was sitting upstairs.
    <br>I have never fallen down before.
    <br>I am surprised.
    <br>But now that you have fallen down for the first time in the history of you being a pastor,
    <br>what do you have to say?
    <br>I think power pass power.
    <br>All power belongs to Jesus.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>But you said something now – you said you are 430 years old and that you are an idol from the family.
    <br>Me?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>I am a pastor. I am just 50 years old. I am not an idol.
    <br>You are not 430 years old?
    <br>No, I am just 50 years old.
    <br>That very demon that was tormenting your life, is out.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>You are delivered.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Live the rest of your life to please Jesus.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>God bless you.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God with us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Amen.
    <br>My name is Pastor Uchechukwu Lukman.
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my lovely helpmate.
    <br>I am a pastor by calling.
    <br>By His grace, I'm an evangelist who is into deliverance ministry.
    <br>I grew up in a background that was rooted in idol worship.
    <br>When we were growing up, we were taken to the shrine and were given incisions.
    <br>Even up to this date, we still have some of those shrines in my father's house.
    <br>My father still sacrifices animals to them.
    <br>We had those incisions.
    <br>When I grew up, things were not working; not just for me alone but for my family,
    <br>my immediate siblings and my cousins.
    <br>Things were not working out.
    <br>There was this barrier of limitation that had always been with those before me -
    <br>those who were older than me.
    <br>We had been living a life of strife and limitation until eventually, like I said, I gave my life to Christ.
    <br>In my family, I became the first born-again Christian after over 400 years.
    <br>It was tough growing up in those days; I was disowned by my parents.
    <br>I was rejected and cast away by my family.
    <br>It was difficult living in my community then as a child of God.
    <br>To God be the glory, I did not deny my faith.
    <br>I continued.
    <br>Until...
    <br>I left the church and started working in some other ministries,
    <br>moving around, both here and outside the country for evangelical work.
    <br>It was not easy – you would minister to people; they would get miracles but they would not remember you.
    <br>A lot of them would prosper but they would not remember you.
    <br>That had been happening.
    <br>I knew that I was from a background of idol worship.
    <br>I knew it was a problem and I had gone for counselling.
    <br>I had gone to many ministers of God for deliverance and counselling but the thing remained there.
    <br>The most agonising thing was
    <br>you know, if you are a man of God and you don’t have a settled home,
    <br>then you have a problem because you must first of all pastor your house.
    <br>But I had a partner who was supposed to be a helpmate but in the background was an enemy
    <br>whom the devil was using to work against me.
    <br>My lovely wife in those days, before last week, would not greet me, "Good morning".
    <br>We lived like that for years.
    <br>We didn’t share the same bedroom; we did not eat together.
    <br>I did not even eat in the house.
    <br>Sometimes, before I went to the altar and picked up the microphone,
    <br>I would have my day spoiled and my psyche depressed.
    <br>I know what that means as a minister.
    <br>It had been a battle until I met some friends who handed a hospitality company over to me.
    <br>I began to manage that company as a hospitality business while also doing my pastoral work.
    <br>Surprisingly, I would see people who worshipped at The SCOAN come to the company.
    <br>They were my customers.
    <br>They would come with their problems.
    <br>You would see them coming to The SCOAN; when they returned back to the hotel, they would be different.
    <br>I saw the case of a particular woman who came to The SCOAN and came back with the Anointing Water.
    <br>She used it and before we knew it, my boys called me into the woman's room.
    <br>She started excreting a fibroid in the toilet.
    <br>We began to wonder what was happening.
    <br>It happened that there was a particular case - a friend who was a lodger.
    <br>He had a job appointment from one of these oil companies in Bayelsa, Nigeria.
    <br>They asked him to do medical tests, which he did.
    <br>He came back and was positive to HIV.
    <br>After coming to The SCOAN, he came back and he was insisting that I take him to any nearby hospital
    <br>so that he could do a test again and confirm his HIV status.
    <br>I drove him in my car; we went to Federal Medical Centre for a confirmation test.
    <br>I was baffled that the man who initially had a medical report,
    <br>stating that he was HIV positive, became negative.
    <br>All these things and many other things started happening.
    <br>I began to wonder because as a matter of truth and sincerity,
    <br>I was one of those men who actually criticized this ministry.
    <br>I must tell you that.
    <br>On seeing these miracles, I got the tapes of the man of God,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua and started listening to them – the audio and video.
    <br>I was shocked at the wisdom, the insight into the interpretation of the Word of God.
    <br>The miracles moved me but the insight into the Scriptures was amazing.
    <br>There are portions of the Scripture that some ministers would not want to dive into and
    <br>you would see Prophet T.B. Joshua diving into them, treating them, counselling people on them
    <br>and it is wonderful.
    <br>He has been a blessing to me; I must tell you that.
    <br>Praise the Lord.
    <br>This continued and I began to reminisce in my heart; I began to have second thoughts.
    <br>I began to have a close study of the ministry.
    <br>It encouraged me and I decided that I was going to be a part of this ministry.
    <br>Last Sunday was a great day in my life.
    <br>I walked into this church and it was awesome when the wise men were going round.
    <br>Before Wise Man Daniel got to my row,
    <br>I was surprised that I felt some shivering inside of me; I was shaking.
    <br>I was wondering what was happening.
    <br>I knew I had no malaria parasite.
    <br>I began to wonder what was happening and lo and behold,
    <br>he placed his hand, first on my chest; it was like a bomb.
    <br>I had a ballistic missile explosion.
    <br>I was still staggering; I didn’t know what I was doing.
    <br>He touched my head again.
    <br>Before I knew it, I discovered I was talking but I didn't know what I was saying until
    <br>the final deliverance was conducted on me and I became a free man.
    <br>SCOAN Testimony
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>[God with us]
    <br>After the deliverance that day, I met with the counsellors.
    <br>I came here alone; I didn't come with her.
    <br>While I was still trying to grasp my movement, whether to be a part of this ministry or not,
    <br>I was always asking my wife to be a part so we could come together
    <br>but she never wanted to hear anything about The SCOAN.
    <br>I was surprised that the day after my deliverance,
    <br>my eldest daughter called me while I was still sitting in the church.
    <br>She asked, "Daddy, where are you?"
    <br>I said, "I am in the church".
    <br>She asked, "Which church?"
    <br>I said, "I am in The SCOAN".
    <br>She said she thought that my deliverance was genuine.
    <br>I asked her why she was saying that.
    <br>She said, "Mummy has just picked up all your clothes and she is outside washing them".
    <br>I was dumbfounded because that had never happened for many years.
    <br>When I got home, the following morning when she came to me, she said, "Daddy, good morning, sir".
    <br>Initially, I did not know she was the one talking.
    <br>She repeated it, "Daddy, I am saying good morning, sir".
    <br>I turned and laughed; I was happy.
    <br>Since then, she has changed.
    <br>I am so happy; I am testifying to that.
    <br>The people around me saw that something had just happened to me and my family.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>The deliverance that happened to our father affected the wife and everybody around.
    <br>Just only one person in the family.
    <br>Once a person in the family is delivered, every bondage and chain connected to the family is loosed.
    <br>I still have a second testimony that is so astonishing.
    <br>I had a family that visited us from Kano.
    <br>Their fifteen year old daughter had ran away from home
    <br>and for one month, we had been running helter skelter, looking for her.
    <br>On the day of my deliverance, after receiving the call from my daughter
    <br>that my wife had taken my clothes to wash,
    <br>I was surprised that the girl who had never been to Lagos, who doesn’t know anywhere in Lagos,
    <br>walked by herself back home on that day.
    <br>I am happy, fulfilled and have peace inside of me.
    <br>I think I have a brand new marriage now.
