    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Today we shall talk about:
    <br>THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT ON EARTH
    <br>People believe until they become very very rich, famous - just talk about those things you desire...
    <br>Ask yourself, "What is the greatest achievement on earth?"
    <br>Ask your neighbor.
    <br>[What is the greatest achievement on earth?]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[What is the greatest achievement on earth?]
    <br>Can somebody answer this question?
    <br>What is the greatest achievement?
    <br>The greatest achievement on earth is having Jesus Christ.
    <br>Having Jesus Christ.
    <br>You listen to that? 
    <br>You achieved that?
    <br>Yes, man of God.
    <br>Oh, you listen to that.
    <br>She has got it wrong.
    <br>Somebody who has Jesus and can not talk to Jesus, and Jesus can not talk to her.
    <br>Which kind of Jesus is that? Is he the dead one?
    <br>The only Jesus we know is Jesus of Nazareth, in the power of Holy Ghost.
    <br>If you have Jesus, you will be able to talk to Him and He Himself will be able to talk to you.
    <br>Prayer is a two-way conversation; you talk and He talks.
    <br>That is it.
    <br>But a situation where you are the only talking - to who?
    <br>Which Jesus?
    <br>That is why I said you got it wrong.
    <br>The greatest achievement on earth is to walk in the Spirit.
    <br>Are you walking in the Spirit?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Hmm...
    <br>OK, what does Jesus say about me?
    <br>Don't lie because I know what Jesus says about me.
    <br>What does He say now?
    <br>Now?
    <br>Concerning me.
    <br>Concerning you - you are a genuine man of God.
    <br>What will I say now?
    <br>That is not the question I am asking you.
    <br>I think the greatest achievement on earth is to be filled with the Holy Spirit
    <br>and have Jesus Christ as the Lord and Saviour and every other thing will be added unto you.
    <br>Are you filled?
    <br>Somehow.
    <br>Somehow. And what is not done well
    <br>[is not done at all].
    <br>I say, what is not done well - somehow, it's not done at all. That is Jesus' standard for you.
    <br>Ok, thank you.
    <br>We are asking ourselves the greatest achievement on earth.
    <br>Because whatever you claim you have achieved, you are still struggling  with peace.
    <br>You are still struggling with joy.
    <br>Joy today, another one tomorrow...
    <br>Your joy is not constant, your peace is not constant. I mean...
    <br>What is the greatest achievement?
    <br>Viewers, thank you for your time.
    <br>I know the Lord will bless your time today.
    <br>Let's take the book of Romans 12 - a living sacrifice.
    <br>"Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy,
    <br>to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God -
    <br>this is your true and proper worship."
    <br>Listen to that: "This is your true and proper worship.
    <br>Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
    <br>Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - his good, pleasing and perfect will."
    <br>Roman 12; you take your reading from verse 1 to the end,
    <br>and the Book of Daniel 6:10 and 1 Corinthians 14:14 to 15 or to the end.
    <br>It will be good for you.
    <br>And the Book of Acts 2:4 and the brother Job 11:13-19.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>As we continue, the book of Galatians 4:6 also will help.
    <br>As we continue we will have more books to talk about.
    <br>As for me and my household,
    <br>the greatest achievement on earth is to pray as God wants us to pray.
    <br>Prayer is the key 
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Jesus started with prayer 
    <br>And ended with prayer
    <br>Prayer is the master key
    <br>Why should anyone not want a master key - a master key to loose and to bind.
    <br>To pray as God wants you to pray is the greatest achievement on earth.
    <br>You will be able to know God's opinion about yourself and God's opinion about others;
    <br>you will be able to get involved in God's project, in God's master plan.
    <br>There is God's project everywhere.
    <br>God's project;
    <br>Help as God would have...
    <br>Talk as God would have...
    <br>Pray as God would...
    <br>Teach as God would...
    <br>These are God's projects.
    <br>Such a life of prayer costs.
    <br>You know what I mean by "costs"?
    <br>It demands sacrifice.
    <br>All prayer saints have spent hours everyday in prayer.
    <br>All prayer saints, God's people have spent hours everyday in prayer.
    <br>This means, prayer is a lifestyle to them.
    <br>Is prayer a lifestyle to you?
    <br>No!
    <br>Prayer can not be a lifestyle because
    <br>with words of prayer on your lips, it is not possible for you to pray without ceasing.
    <br>With words of prayer on your lips, it is not possible for prayer to be a lifestyle.
    <br>'Lifestyle' means praying without ceasing.
    <br>Are you praying now?
    <br>Are you in the attitude of prayer?
    <br>No, you are looking at me - at the same time your heart is seized.
    <br>You can not do that.
    <br>This is the level we want to build you to.
    <br>The saints were able to pray without ceasing because they were in the spirit of prayer.
    <br>But you are not in the spirit of prayer but prayer with word on your lips, not in your heart.
    <br>They were are able to achieve this because they were in the spirit of prayer.
    <br>There is a difference between saying words and praying prayer.
    <br>What is prayer?
    <br>Prayer is a relationship that exists between God and His children.
    <br>A relationship that what?
    <br>That exists between who?
    <br>God and His children, Christians, believers, God's people, God's person.
    <br>A relationship that exists.
    <br>What kind of relationship do you have? And you are praying...
    <br>You must have a relationship before prayer.
    <br>Who is God? God is Spirit and the real thing about you is spirit.
    <br>So, it means spirit - spirit; spirit joins himself, immerses, acts...
    <br>Your spirit means heart. When I say, 'heart', I mean your spirit.
    <br>Your real self is not your body; it's spirit.
    <br>God is Spirit.
    <br>Now He joined Himself, immersed...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Tell your neighbour:
    <br>The real thing about you is spirit.
    <br>If God wants to talk to you, your heart is the contact point, not your body.
    <br>So when you hear people say: "I hear God talking to me in the ear", you know it's not God.
    <br>Heart - means your spirit.
    <br>Your heart is the contact point, is the communication point,
    <br>like the Book of Romans 9:1 says.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>His Spirit in our heart, in our spirit, enables us to cry naturally, that is, effortlessly.
    <br>It is not the kind of prayer you pray now - when you are praying, you get tired.
    <br>Naturally, in the Spirit.
    <br>God's Spirit in our heart enables us to preach naturally, to cry naturally, "Abba! Father!"
    <br>That Book of Galatians 4:6...
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>What am I saying, if you are with me?
    <br>Am I just talking to myself?
    <br>I am talking to myself.
    <br>I am going back.
    <br>God's Spirit in our heart - it means
    <br>for God's Spirit to come into our heart, our heart must act upon the Word of God.
    <br>His Spirit in our heart enables us to cry naturally, "Abba! Father!"
    <br>Heart - what is heart?
    <br>Our life reflects what is in our heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "My life reflects what is in my heart."
    <br>When you do like this... it means there is a kind of joy in your heart.
    <br>When you... - heart is troubled.
    <br>I am what is in my heart; you are what is in your heart.
    <br>Tell your neighbor.
    <br>[I am what is in my heart; you are what is in your heart.]
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[I am what is in my heart; you are what is in your heart.]
    <br>That is why we say, don't just get married to people because she is beautiful, he is handsome,
    <br>he is good looking, famous but...
    <br>Love is a thing of the heart.
    <br>I am what is in my heart; you are what is in your heart.
    <br>My life reflects what is in my heart.
    <br>We talk about heart...
    <br>The heart refers to the inner man, the man himself.
    <br>That is heart - the man himself.
    <br>It is the seat of desire, will, emotion, knowledge, wisdom, moral character.
    <br>It is the fountain of all he does; man - the man himself, the heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>Lord, I want to be like Jesus 
    <br>Inner my heart
    <br>That is why God is interested in the state of your heart.
    <br>The heart - the man himself.
    <br>Let someone say: "The heart - the man himself".
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[The heart - the man himself.]
    <br>You see people waiting for healing - you see them there.
    <br>If you truly believe in your heart, your character will reflect your faith.
    <br>You see somebody who has problem started laughing - he knows he will be healed, that is why he is laughing.
    <br>While you see some of them there, "Man of God help me..."
    <br>You are here already!
    <br>Tell your neighbour,  "If you truly believe in your heart, your behaviour will reflect your faith."
    <br>Maybe some people are trying to change now: "Man of God is talking, let me start laughing."
    <br>No, that cannot work.
    <br>You see some start saying: "Oh my God. Thank you, Lord."
    <br>Some of us here had arranged party at home, before they came here.
    <br>They had arranged some food, friends: "Please, I am coming back, please, I want you to rejoice with me."
    <br>Yet, he is still having that pain. Why?
    <br>If you truly believe in your heart, your behaviour will reflect your faith.
    <br>He had arranged a party and indeed, he will do that party today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you truly believe in your heart, your behaviour will reflect your faith.
    <br>That is why when you say: "This capsule - I don't know whether I should stop using it.
    <br>I will ask man of God after prayer."
    <br>If you truly believe in your heart... 
    <br>Tell  your neighbour, "If you truly believe in your heart, your behaviour will reflect your faith."
    <br>"After the prayer I will ask man of God, whether I can still use this tablet.
    <br>After the prayer, I will ask man of God, whether I should go for a medical check up to see whether I am healed."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you truly believe in your heart, your behaviour will reflect your faith."
    <br>Can you see what we call "heart"?
    <br>Heart -  the man himself.
    <br>Heart - the seat of the will, wisdom, knowledge, the conscience.
    <br>His Spirit in our heart - God's Spirit in our heart enables us to cry naturally, "Abba! Father!"
    <br>A believing heart produces good work and right behaviour as proof of faith.
    <br>A believing heart produces right behaviour and good work as proof of faith.
    <br>When you see somebody who is behaving: "You should leave me!", you know this one is not a Christian.
    <br>"Please don't talk to me like that; I will deal with you!"
    <br>A believing heart produces right behaviour and good work as proof of faith.
    <br>Good work and right behaviour that honour Jesus,
    <br>reveal that true faith is already lodged in our heart.
    <br>Right behaviour and good jobs that honour God
    <br>reveal that true faith is already lodged in our hearts.
    <br>Take note: Right behaviour and good jobs never produce faith; they are the result of faith.
    <br>That is why you can see me here. How much education?
    <br>You that are well educated, professors - will you stand and be talking like this?
    <br>But the Spirit in my heart enables me to talk naturally without carrying laptop,
    <br>without carrying book, without carrying anything.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Without carrying anything, without having paper, without going back to the altar and saying,
    <br>"Praise the Lord! Amen! You see, Jesus is great. I am telling you, Jesus, Jesus. Amen!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You talk naturally; ability to talk...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This sense of fatherhood produces a natural basis for prayer.
    <br>So, where are we going?
    <br>Now you have known your position.
    <br>You are not what you say you are, when it comes to things of the spirit. 
    <br>I don't want the last day to come before you know this.
    <br>To be pure in heart, our heart must act upon the Word of God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "To be pure in heart, our heart must act upon the Word of God."
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>[To be pure in heart, our heart must act upon the Word of God.]
    <br>Our heart must act upon the Word of God to be pure in heart.
    <br>How?
    <br>That is the question now: How?
    <br>By meditating on what we read in the Scripture and turning it over and over again in our heart
    <br>so that our heart can act upon the Word to influence our conduct.
    <br>"Please, don't talk to me like that!..."
    <br>When the Word of God influences your behaviour, you will not find yourself naturally talking like that.
    <br>Not struggling to talk, "I don't want to talk like that; I don't know...Oh my God!"
    <br>When you finish talking, you want to talk - you are struggling to stop your behaviour.
    <br>You keep striving: "I don't want to do this; I find myself doing it."
    <br>The heart has not yet acted.
    <br>We have to work and work and work to turn our hearts, in tune with God.
    <br>Our right behaviour is determined by the condition of our heart.
    <br>What is determined?
    <br>Our behaviour is determined by the condition of our heart.
    <br>When the anger comes: "What this T.B. Joshua is saying? I'm going home."
    <br>Nobody can stop you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Our behaviour is determined by the condition of our heart."
    <br>Prayer is a two-way conversation.
    <br>I talk to God and God talks to me - that is prayer.
    <br>I talk to God and God talks to me.
    <br>This is what I mean by:
    <br>God's Spirit in our heart enables us to cry naturally, effortless: "Abba! Father!"
    <br>I talk to God and God talks to me.
    <br>Don't forget - God is Spirit.
    <br>Those who want to talk to Him must do so in Spirit and truth.
    <br>If you do not talk to Him in Spirit, it is not in truth.
    <br>If you do not talk to God in Spirit, it means it is not in truth and so it is all nothing - in vain.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus..."
    <br>If you do not talk to Him in the Spirit - because God is Spirit -
    <br>it is not in truth and so it is all nothing, all in vain.
    <br>It means you talk to the air; it means you are inviting satan to come and attack you.
    <br>Because when satan hears the name of Jesus: "Who is talking there?"
    <br>This is what happened to seven sons of Sceva - they were not talking to God in spirit.
    <br>So when they said: "Jesus, Jesus!", satan said: "Who is talking there?"
    <br>He wants to know who is talking.
    <br>By the time they trace you, "You are the one talking" -
    <br>they want to know by what authority... Are you talking in spirit?
    <br>If they realize you are not talking in spirit - oh my God; those nightmares, those attacks...
    <br>You know, sometimes, when you pray and sleep - that is when they will attack you.
    <br>If I am talking to you...
    <br>Imagine, when you now finish your fasting - for two days, three days fasting - you suffer so much,
    <br>you refuse to eat, you struggle not to eat not in command of God but in your own command.
    <br>After you try it, you are about to die, you say,
    <br>"No, I will not die, this fasting - I must finish it today."
    <br>You finally finish the fast, you say: "Thank God! Jesus, I know, You have accepted me."
    <br>By the time you sleep, they will get you naked and start giving you food.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Heart. Lets someone say 'heart'.
    <br>God listens to us when we pray and He replies in relation to the state of our heart.
    <br>He replies according to the state of our heart.
    <br>Let someone say 'heart'.
    <br>My life reflects what is in my heart.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>He replies in relation to the state of your heart.
    <br>The heart refers to the man himself.
    <br>It is the seat of will, conscience, wisdom.
    <br>It is the fountain of all you do.
    <br>Let someone say, "The man himself, the heart."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[The man himself - the heart.]
    <br>Tell you neighbour, "Take care of your heart."
    <br>- I cannot hear you.
    <br>- [Take care of your heart.]
    <br>Take care of your heart.
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart without ceasing -
    <br>in hymns, in spiritual songs, making melodies in your heart to the Lord.
    <br>The best way to take care of your heart is to constantly pray in your heart
    <br>in hymns, in spiritual songs.
    <br>I will praise Him
    <br>For evermore
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart because saying words is not praying prayer.
    <br>You are saying words, not prayer.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>You are saying words, not prayer.
    <br>I don't want you to waste your time, continuing to say words and saying you are praying.
    <br>Prayer is a two-way conversation.
    <br>You talk to God and God talks to you - that is prayer.
    <br>Please, work on your heart.
    <br>To be pure in heart, your heart must act upon the Word of God.
    <br>By meditating - work...
    <br>One of the processings is to continue praying in your heart.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus. Take more of me; give me more of You."
    <br>Get your heart in order - it is the seat of God; it is the communication point.
    <br>It is the contact  point - your heart.
    <br>The real thing about you is your heart.
    <br>That is the real thing about you.
    <br>That is the landing point.
    <br>That is the station - your heart.
    <br>The prayer you will see me offer any moment from now is not that prayer that is answered.
    <br>The prayer that is answered is the one that I have loaded myself with.
    <br>I am pregnant now.
    <br>THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT ON EARTH
    <br>You have to be pregnant of the Word to deliver.
    <br>You cannot continue praying all the time with the word of prayer on your lips.
    <br>Will you continue to say: "In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus"?
    <br>Any time you say that without the Spirit of God, your body is just...
    <br>If people call you, "How are you?", you will not answer
    <br>because it's not possible for you to answer because you are the one praying.
    <br>You are the one praying: "In the name of Jesus!" - and if someone says: "How are you?", you will not answer
    <br>because you are praying.
    <br>And you are not the one praying!
    <br>It is the Spirit of Father in our heart that enables us to pray.
    <br>Oh my God!
    <br>THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT ON EARTH
    <br>My brother, come here.
    <br>Let us demonstrate this to them.
    <br>You see my brother here.
    <br>So now I want to pray, but I am not supposed to pray.
    <br>It is the Spirit of Father that is supposed to enable me to pray.
    <br>But now I want to pray just the same way you pray.
    <br>When I'm praying now, you call me, you talk to me, continue talking to me.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus!
    <br>You don't know I am praying?
    <br>Talk louder, let people hear you.
    <br>- Hello, sir! 
    <br>- You are disturbing me, please, I am praying.
    <br>That is the prayer we offer.
    <br>We pray on our own and we are the one praying.
    <br>But with the help of Holy Spirit now, I want to pray; you call me.
    <br>Talk louder, let people hear what you are saying.
    <br>- Hello, sir! 
    <br>- How are you?
    <br>You see we are talking together and I am praying.
    <br>- How are you? Where are you going? 
    <br>- I am going to my seat.
    <br>- You are going to your seat.
    <br>- OK
    <br>Look at the crowd, they are looking at us. What do you think is happening?
    <br>And I am praying and at the same time doing what?
    <br>I'm praying and at the same time I'm talking.
    <br>They are trying to know what we are doing.
    <br>They are still laughing. I don't know why they are laughing.
    <br>- And at the same time I'm doing what? 
    <br>- [Praying.]
    <br>That is why there is no room for enemy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>But in your own case...
    <br>Now, I want to pray on my own.
    <br>Talk to me.
    <br>Don't disturb me, I am praying.
    <br>But if there is more important thing, I will stop my prayer, I will attend to him.
    <br>Like money - I trust you.
    <br>Go and sit down, sir. Thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see the need to allow the Spirit of Father?
    <br>We don't know how to pray but the Spirit of Father helps us in our prayer.
    <br>But what is happening to you now?
    <br>The Spirit of Father in our heart enables us to pray naturally.
    <br>That word 'naturally' means it is not me - effortlessly.
    <br>The Spirit of Father in our heart enables us to pray naturally.
    <br>My heart 
    <br>Hear the voice of God
    <br>My heart
    <br>Hear the voice of Holy Spirit
    <br>Let there be freedom

    <br>Let there be rest in my heart
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service

    <br>Hallelujah!

    <br>Thank you.
    <br>You will agree with me, that is the greatest achievement here on earth -
    <br>to be able to know God's opinion about you and about others
    <br>and to get involved in God's projects.
    <br>That is the greatest achievement.
    <br>I don't know any other achievement that can be compared to this.
    <br>THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT ON EARTH
    <br>I bless your heart.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>So, like I have said,
    <br>constantly pray in your heart in hymns, in spiritual songs.
    <br>If it is just the name "Jesus", the name "Jesus Christ", the "blood of Jesus Christ",
    <br>you have done it all in your heart - that alone.
    <br>The name "Jesus Christ", the "blood of Jesus Christ" - that alone in your heart;
    <br>running and running over and over - that is more than enough
    <br>to flush out all this strong conflicts between flesh and spirit.
    <br>For - against; there is so much strong divisions,
    <br>so much divisions in your heart.
    <br>Whether to go or not, whether to do it or not, whether to listen or not, whether to pray or not -
    <br>flush this.
    <br>Take a stand - your heart must take a stand for Jesus. 
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Constantly pray in your heart in hymns, in spiritual songs, making melodies in your heart for the Lord.
    <br>And constantly pray: "In the name of Jesus, in the blood of Jesus!" - you have said it all.
    <br>Then, you can tune to praises and worship in your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"I know you can save me; save me, Lord!
    <br>I know you can deliver me; deliver me, Lord."
    <br>That's all.
    <br>"Oh Lord Jesus, I know You can save me; save me, Lord!
    <br>I know You can deliver me; deliver me, Lord!
    <br>I know You can heal me; heal me, Lord!"
    <br>With this, you will receive self-healing, self-deliverance.
    <br>On your own you will be delivered without anybody delivering you.
    <br>On your own you will get saved without anybody praying for you for salvation.
    <br>You will get blessed abundantly without someone coming to pray for you.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>"Lord Jesus, I know You can save me; save me, Lord!"
    <br>With that constantly running in your heart, you will soon get self-deliverance, self-salvation.
    <br>That is the salvation when no one comes to pray for you - you pray for yourself.
    <br>Your heart will be clear.
    <br>Like I have said,
    <br>to be pure in heart is by meditation.
    <br>The Word becomes part of you.
    <br>Stand up, sir.
    <br>The Word of God becomes part of you.
    <br>To be part of you is integral - like your hand.
    <br>This hand now, it's not only part - it is integral.
    <br>You cannot remove it.
    <br>If anything happens to this hand, it will happen to the whole you.
    <br>If you have a pain here, you have headache - everything is affected.
    <br>That is part; not only just part - an integral part.
    <br>For the Word to become an integral part of you - meditation.
    <br>Our heart acts upon Word to give a new birth.
    <br>The Bible says God's power working through His Word and His Spirit gives a new birth.
    <br>Let someone say, "God's power."
    <br>When I say 'God's power', I mean Jesus.
    <br>Power - Jesus.
    <br>Jesus - Power.
    <br>God's power working through His Word and His Spirit gives a new birth.
    <br>Sit down sir. Thank you.
