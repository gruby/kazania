    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>If God be for us, who can be against us? Nobody!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let's look at 2 Corinthians 12 about Apostle Paul,
    <br>and I will take the reading from verse 7.
    <br>"And lest I be exalted above measure, by the abundance of the revelations,
    <br>a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of satan to buffet me."
    <br>Verse 8.
    <br>"Concerning this thing, I pleaded with the Lord three times
    <br>that it might depart from me."
    <br>Verse 9.
    <br>"And He said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you.
    <br>For my strength is made perfect in weakness'.
    <br>Therefore, most gladly, I would rather boast in my infirmities
    <br>that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
    <br>Let's stop here.
    <br>In this text now, Paul knew that his challenges were to correct him from being proud.
    <br>You know, when you read down, you will see 'conceited'.
    <br>He knew his challenges were to correct him.
    <br>Some of the reasons we look back is because of the mistakes or pain of the past.
    <br>Paul knew that his challenges...
    <br>When we say 'challenges', it could be of sickness, poverty, hardship,
    <br>backwardness, limitation in progress or any foolish thing.
    <br>Paul knew his challenges were to correct him from being proud or conceited.
    <br>In that text, when you read down, from the beginning to the end,
    <br>Paul knew his challenges were to correct him from being proud or conceited.
    <br>That was why he was not offended;
    <br>that was why he did not look at God in a bad light.
    <br>Like many of us - "I pay my tithe; I go to church."
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Don't give up when God corrects you."
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Don't give up when God corrects you.
    <br>Be encouraged that God loves you enough to correct you.
    <br>As if somebody says, "Please come here! Why should you do this? It is wrong!"
    <br>You say, "Why should this man shout on me like this?"
    <br>No, no, no! He loves you.
    <br>The more that correction, the more your greatness.
    <br>Be encouraged when God corrects you.
    <br>Be encouraged that God loves you enough to correct you.
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "Be encouraged that God loves you enough to correct you."
    <br>Paul knew that his challenges - the thorn in his flesh - were to correct him
    <br>from being proud, arrogant and conceited.
    <br>Whatever you are facing,
    <br>whatever your challenges are as a Christian -
    <br>it could be poverty, this or that.
    <br>You can be sick; your sickness is not like others' but for the glory of God.
    <br>Others' sickness is to kill them, destroy them
    <br>but our own is to reform us for a better position,
    <br>to keep us for a new level in life.
    <br>Whatever you are facing - it could be poverty or whatever - as a Christian is a way of correction.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Whatever situation you are facing, whatever your challenges are
    <br>as a Christian, are a way of correction.
    <br>Your challenges are not meant to destroy you.
    <br>Your challenges may be to reform you for a better position.
    <br>Your challenges may be to keep you for a new level in life.
    <br>Your challenges may be to strengthen your desire for God.
    <br>What are your challenges?
    <br>Tell your neighbour: "See your challenges as a reason for believing God
    <br>just as you see your good times."
    <br>See your challenges as a reason for believing God
    <br>just as you see your good times.
    <br>In your good times, you dance and say, "Thank You, Jesus!".
    <br>So when that hard time comes too, "Thank You, Jesus!".
    <br>Paul saw his challenges, the thorn in his flesh,
    <br>as a reason for believing God just as he did in his good times.
    <br>That is why he went to God three times.
    <br>Each time the Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for you", and he did not give up.
    <br>Another time the Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for you".
    <br>Another time...
    <br>Each time is equal to hundred times.
    <br>For summary, one time is equal to hundred times,
    <br>two times - 200 times, three times - 300 times.
    <br>Job saw his challenges as a reason for believing God
    <br>just as he did in his good times.
    <br>Be encouraged when you are corrected by God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Be encouraged when you are corrected by God.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>Be encouraged when you are corrected by God.
    <br>Don't give up when God corrects you.
    <br>Be encouraged that God loves you enough to correct you.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>DONâ€™T GIVE UP! T.B. Joshua - Short Sermon
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Honour God just as you honour Him in your good times -
    <br>honour Him in your situation.
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured in my life
    <br>Every day
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured in my life
    <br>Every day
    <br>If Jesus must be honoured every day,
    <br>remember our spiritual walk with the Lord -
    <br>good and hard times.
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured in my life
    <br>Every day
    <br>Jesus must be honoured
    <br>Jesus must be honoured in my life
    <br>Every day
    <br>Remain silent and think about your life.
    <br>This is the hindrance you are having.
    <br>Your belief, once you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour -
    <br>bed of roses.
    <br>So right now, think about your life.
    <br>Christianity is all about 'relationship'.
    <br>We are not religious people; we are Christians.
    <br>If you must be a Christian, you must be ready for this relationship.
    <br>Our relationship with Christ is in both good and hard times.
    <br>Christianity is all about 'relationship'.
    <br>It is different from religion.
    <br>Religious people, when they are facing hard times,
    <br>they lament, they murmur.
    <br>They begin to see God in a bad light.
    <br>That is religious people.
    <br>But we Christians, we see our challenges as a reason for believing in God,
    <br>just as we see our good times.
    <br>Christians seek not yet repose
    <br>Hear thy guardian angel say
    <br>Thou art in the midst of foes
    <br>Watch and pray
    <br>Christians seek not yet repose
    <br>Hear thy guardian angel say
    <br>Thou art in the midst of foes
    <br>Watch and pray
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ.
