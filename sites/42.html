    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>What you are about to watch is a perfect demonstration of the same kind of miracle
    <br>that happened in the life of the man at the Beautiful Gate in Acts 3.
    <br>Watch and see for yourself and give God the glory!
    <br>The Man At The Beautiful Gate | Crippled Man Walks Instantly | TB Joshua
    <br>Oh, look!
    <br>What a pitiful sight!
    <br>And what a sad story he must have of his suffering,
    <br>due to the debilitating condition he is in!
    <br>This poor handicapped man uses his hands and feet
    <br>to drag himself along the ground,
    <br>unable to afford a wheelchair or any alternative to get around.
    <br>This man has been in this crippled state for the past ten years.
    <br>With tears of despair running down his cheeks,
    <br>his face is an expression of utter helplessness.
    <br>He cries because he is not only lame, but living in abject poverty.
    <br>What poverty this is!
    <br>Can you imagine what it would be like to crawl on your hands and feet
    <br>as your only option to get from place to place.
    <br>My name is Ajayi Ogunleye.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN is that I am crippled; I cannot walk.
    <br>I don't have a helper unless God sends someone to bless me.
    <br>While sitting outside begging, I call any youth passing by to help me fetch water to bathe.
    <br>Sometimes, when I give people money and a plate to buy food for me,
    <br>they run away with it.
    <br>I am tired of all this; that is why I left there to come here.
    <br>I know that coming here, I will be healed.
    <br>Going home without healing, it would be better I die.
    <br>In search of even the basic necessities, he is here to meet Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>to care for his needs in terms of money, food, shelter, clothing,
    <br>or a wheelchair to aid his mobility.
    <br>Just as Prophet T.B. Joshua has been providing for others in the same situation as him.
    <br>He is seeking silver and gold.
    <br>But what is his essential need?
    <br>Is it silver and gold, or is it healing?
    <br>Look at his hands - calloused, rough and filthy
    <br>are the hands he uses to pull himself along the ground.
    <br>He reaches inside his ragged shirt
    <br>and brings out a soiled grobby sack which is tied around his neck.
    <br>From within the sack, he brings out a plastic bag containing all the money he has,
    <br>not even enough for a square meal.
    <br>Leaning to one side,
    <br>he shows the taterred foam padding he uses as a cushion
    <br>to make his moving a little less painful as he drags himself along.
    <br>The rough foam is all he has to protect himself from the hard earth, stones,
    <br>broken glass, nails, and other sharp objects he encounters all the time on his way.
    <br>He goes to wait for Prophet T.B. Joshua at the gate of The SCOAN
    <br>to ask for money and help just like the man at the Beautiful Gate in Acts 3
    <br>who asked for silver and gold.
    <br>But Apostle Peter, through the power of the Holy Spirit, gave him something
    <br>more than silver and gold - something that makes money insufficient.
    <br>He was given his essential needs.
    <br>Just exactly like the man at the Beautiful Gate,
    <br>this man sat at the gate of The SCOAN.
    <br>What could be his essential needs?
    <br>A wheel chair?
    <br>A house?
    <br>A meal?
    <br>A friend?
    <br>Is it money?
    <br>Or something more?
    <br>We pray his case would be like that of the man at the Beautiful Gate
    <br>who asked for money but instead received something more.
    <br>While Prophet T.B. Joshua was conducting the Sunday service, led by the Holy Spirit,
    <br>he moves outside the auditorium and walks through the street,
    <br>greeting members and receiving prayer requests.
    <br>The man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, is on his way to the gate.
    <br>He sights the man and heads straight for him,
    <br>not even stopping to ask what he was doing there or why he had come,
    <br>as if he was looking for someone in need of healing.
    <br>God can use any medium to heal.
    <br>In this case, He uses Prophet T.B. Joshua's shoe as a point of contact.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, rise up!
    <br>The man awkwardly rises to his feet for the first time in ten years.
    <br>Before he even takes his first step,
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua leaves, knowing that it has been done.
    <br>As he often says, "I am not the Healer, I know the Healer, His name is Jesus Christ",
    <br>Jesus has healed this man.
    <br>It is a miracle.
    <br>Members who saw what had happened came forward
    <br>and gathered around the man at the gate,
    <br>encouraging him to move his legs one after the other.
    <br>Not used to standing on his legs, he is understandably somewhat unstable.
    <br>With each wobbly step, his confidence grows that he is healed indeed.
    <br>That week, the man went to show his family a great thing God had done in his life.
    <br>Overjoyed, his family followed him to The SCOAN
    <br>to appreciate God's goodness, testifying to the glory of God.
    <br>Mr. Ajayi now beautifully dressed in white trousers with a shirt and tie,
    <br>proudly rises to his feet and walks in front of his family, demonstrating his healing.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Ajayi Ogunleye from Ondo State, Nigeria.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was that I was crippled.
    <br>I had been crippled for ten years.
    <br>Formerly, I was a herbalist. I tried to treat myself
    <br>and went to other herbalist friends but there was no way.
    <br>When I started begging to eat, I met a lady who introduced me to The SCOAN.
    <br>That was when I met Prophet T.B. Joshua, a picture of Jesus, in my dreams.
    <br>What I saw physically was that he put his foot on my legs and told me to stand up.
    <br>I stood up immediately. Since that time, I started to walk
    <br>and do everything by myself again. Today, I came from Akure by myself.
    <br>Therefore, I want the children of God to help me shout three times "Emmanuel".
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>The man of God did not collect any money from me.
    <br>My promise to God is to run from sin, to live the rest of my life for Jesus
    <br>and serve Him properly.
    <br>After sharing his heartwarming testimony,
    <br>Mr Ajayi stands up smartly and walks around the church auditorium.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>When Jesus says yes, no one can say no.
    <br>He is a mighty God.
    <br>Sharing his joy with the congregation and exchanging a few handshakes,
    <br>one can hardly believe that this gentleman was the same person
    <br>who crawled through the streets on his hands and feet.
    <br>When Jesus says yes, no one can say no.
    <br>When Jesus says it's Ok, no one can say no.
    <br>When Jesus says it's alright, no one can say no.
    <br>When Jesus says bless you, no one can say curse you.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>The evidence of Jesus Christ is lives changed.
    <br>Rejoicing with pilgrims to The SCOAN from all across the wold,
    <br>Mr Ajayi leads them in a processional dance.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus, for the man at the Beautiful Gate of our time.
