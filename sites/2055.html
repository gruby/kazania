    <br>TRANSVESTITE TRANSFORMED!
    <br>Antonio Cáceres was a male prostitute for most of his adult life.
    <br>With a wardrobe filled with only scanty female clothing, he became known as a notorious transvestite throughout his nation.
    <br>When Prophet T.B. Joshua came to Paraguay, he mocked until the miracle happened in his own life.
    <br>He dressed as a woman although he was a man, and in faith, I took the photo to the crusade.
    <br>He didn't want to go or know anything about it.
    <br>Then, after the crusade, God surprised me with His love and mercy
    <br>and here I can see the power of God working in my family.
    <br>My name is Antonio Cáceres and I come from the city of Lambaré in Paraguay.
    <br>This is my sister who has told a bit of my story.
    <br>Truly, for 10 years, I was doing prostitution.
    <br>I was a transsexual and a transvestite.
    <br>The spirit of homosexuality was inside me for as long as I can remember, at 7 years old.
    <br>From when I was very young, I felt like a woman.
    <br>Then it got worse and I started stealing things that I wasn't supposed to wear, like female underwear I took from my sister.
    <br>I would secretly dress like a woman and little by little, the spirit continued to use me until it led me to prostitution on the streets.
    <br>I didn't care about the money I made; I just wanted to sleep with men.
    <br>I had long hair, dyed blonde, and dressed as a woman in high heels, short skirts, tight jeans, revealing tops with my hair loose.
    <br>I took female hormones which took away the natural hair that I had as a man.
    <br>I first saw Prophet T.B. Joshua on the TV stations in Paraguay.
    <br>Later, I heard about him through my sister.
    <br>My sister invited me to the crusade but I told her I didn't want to go because I thought that everything was fake.
    <br>I even made fun of it because I didn't believe until my deliverance happened.
    <br>I experienced my deliverance in a moment one night when I felt very empty and alone.
    <br>I was watching the crusade on YouTube and later I found out that my sister took my photo there.
    <br>The moment that Prophet T.B. Joshua started to pray, I began to feel empty and nauseous.
    <br>From that moment, I began to vomit.
    <br>I believe it is the power of Jesus through Prophet T.B. Joshua that delivered me from this evil spirit.
    <br>I realised that God used Prophet T.B. Joshua to transform me into who I now am.
    <br>I was like that before but now I am like this!
    <br>I began to vomit and from there, I started noticing the change.
    <br>I no longer liked the way I used to dress.
    <br>I no longer liked the long hair that I used to have.
    <br>As I vomited more, I started to distinguish a man from a woman.
    <br>I am now able to see a woman as beautiful and see a man as a man.
    <br>Now, I don't feel affection for men.
    <br>That spirit has left me.
    <br>Now, I want to be like a man and dress like a man
    <br>but I don't have any men's clothes because for the past 10 years, I have been doing this prostitution
    <br>and it is only women's clothes that I have.
    <br>I really want to change.
    <br>After my deliverance, I stopped smoking and taking drugs
    <br>and I no longer have the desire to dress like a woman and be on the streets.
    <br>Now, I don't have nightmares.
    <br>From the moment I saw Prophet T.B. Joshua praying on YouTube, I have had peaceful dreams.
    <br>I don't see men coming to me in my dreams anymore.
    <br>Nothing is oppressing me; I am totally delivered.
    <br>With the spirit responsible for his formerly warped mind gone, Antonio knew that the incredible change inside him must reflect on the outside.
    <br>Embarrassed by the garments of his old life, it was time for a new wardrobe as the Emmanuel TV Team took him on a shopping trip.
    <br>Afterwards, came an extensive haircut.
    <br>Looking like a totally different person, Antonio returned to his home town,
    <br>to the wonder of all those who knew him all his life as a female.
    <br>ONLY JESUS CAN DO THIS!!!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Antonio's Mother Sees The Change In Her Son
    <br>My God, how he has changed!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank You for changing my son.
    <br>Now, he is a man!

    <br>I am Antonio Cáceres; I am from Paraguay.
    <br>Dear brethren, from the age of six, I had been strongly attracted to men.
    <br>From seven years of age, I began to cross-dress using clothes I stole from my sister.
    <br>I felt like a woman from seven years of age.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>My first homosexual experience was at 11 years of age.
    <br>I came from a poor family.
    <br>At 18 years of age, I began to work as a male prostitute.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>My life was in tatters; I spent my nights doing drugs and sleeping with men.
    <br>It was all caused by the evil spirit.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>That spirit had me totally fooled.
    <br>Each morning, I looked at myself in the mirror and I would see the most beautiful woman in the world.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>My sister would constantly invite me to church but I never wished to go.
    <br>I wasn't a believer and didn't want to hear the Word of God.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I told her I would start attending church only when I had heard from God.
    <br>Later on, she spoke to me about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>I laughed and told her that I would not attend the crusade.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Suddenly, during the mass prayer by Prophet T.B. Joshua, a man who is anointed by God,
    <br>I felt a strong need to watch the transmission on YouTube.
    <br>That same night, I felt strange; I vomited and had diarrhoea.
    <br>I felt a strange sensation in my stomach and afterwards I felt something leaving me.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Brethren, that night I felt strange and the urge to prostitute was not there anymore.
    <br>After watching the YouTube transmission, I no longer had the urge to prostitute myself.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>That very night, I became unhappy with my body.
    <br>I looked in the mirror and asked myself, "What have I done to myself? Where am I going?"
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Three days later, I visited my sister and she asked me when I would go to church with her.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I told her that I was tired of that life and wanted to be a man again.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>At that moment, she told me that she had taken my picture to the crusade.
    <br>This is my picture that she took to the crusade.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>At that moment, I realised that my past life was not the right one for me.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>At that moment, I realised that hope depends on faith, love and patience.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Thanks to my family's prayers and the mass prayer during Prophet T.B. Joshua's crusade,
    <br>I can testify that I have been liberated and I am a free man!
    <br>Testimony Time

    <br>When the Holy Spirit starts to pray through Prophet T.B. Joshua during the mass prayer,
    <br>as He has done it for me, He will do it for you!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Before the prophet touched me, I had been claiming my blessings,
    <br>because the Bible says that the Kingdom of Heaven is claimed by fearless believers.
    <br>When the prophet prayed for me, I felt something supernatural.
    <br>During the mass prayer, I felt like I was out of my body and I was joyful.
    <br>I brought neighbours who had paralysis, cancer and asthma, and they were all healed in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I testify because for the last 28 years, I had always seen him dress like a woman.
    <br>Now he is delivered and is the man that God created him to be.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>Dominican Republic Crusade With T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Not only did Antonio receive his deliverance, but he was also financially assisted
    <br>by Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners to support his new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>I am Antonio Cáceres; I am from Paraguay.
    <br>This is my sister here.
    <br>I give all the glory to God, who rescued me from a life of prostitution.
    <br>I was delivered from the spirit of homosexuality.
