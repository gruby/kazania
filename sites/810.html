    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Emmanuel
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Nadine and I come from Sweden.
    <br>It all started last Sunday, when I got a touch from the the man of God - Senior Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>So, I came here today to testify to the goodness of God.
    <br>I got delivered and I just want to thank Jesus and to thank Prophet TB Joshua for serving Him so faithfully.
    <br>Basically, I was six years old, and one day during holidays my cousin and I went to play in the river.
    <br>Then I fell into the river - there I met a gorgeous lady.
    <br>She was so gorgeous; she was beautiful - I have never seen such beauty.
    <br>Even though I was young, I could tell how beautiful she was.
    <br>She helped me out of the river by using her hands and putting me out.
    <br>At the very big surprise of everybody around the river,
    <br>because everybody thought I was dead -  nobody was coming out of that whirlpool.
    <br>Later that night she came in the dream and gave me like a gold ring.
    <br>She became gold, because earlier she was gorgeous black, but that night she became like gold.
    <br>She also turned me into gold, the minute I wore that ring;
    <br>I become gold and then I was swimming in the river.
    <br>Going through the river with her, she was introducing me to different places, fishes and stuff like that.
    <br>Then she took like a snake, because she had a snake,
    <br>she took a snake's eyes and put it in my eyes like lenses.
    <br>From there, if Ied look at you, you would be like...
    <br>You would ask me questions, especially under the sun, if I was wearing lenses,
    <br>because my eyes started changing under the sun.
    <br>She gave me powers on my lips, in my eyes, in my breasts and in my private parts.
    <br>She gave me influence powers and domination powers as well.
    <br>OK, so what were these powers for?
    <br>Basically to dominate people, to be attractive as well, and to seduce people.
    <br>Any man that would come to me would be possessed,
    <br>and his spirit would be sent to the mermaid - to the water.
    <br>After that, I grew up obviously and then I became like a...
    <br>I saw myself always next to the river or in the water.
    <br>Later on, I didn't see to have feet anymore like I have now.
    <br>I could have a tail when I was swimming - so, I was growing up in grades;
    <br>I was becoming a real mermaid and I was growing up in powers.
    <br>OK, you said this happened at the young age of six years.
    <br>What started happening in your life from there?
    <br>From that time, I had the ability to hear dead people.
    <br>If somebody died in the family, I could hear the person asking...
    <br>For instance: when one of our family members died and it was raining and it got cold,
    <br>he came to me around midnight saying, "Tell your mum that I need my jacket,
    <br>because it is very cold outside", or "I can see people dying".
    <br>Everybody dying in the family was always coming to me to say goodbye to me.
    <br>So, that spirit that also gave you power in your eyes - you would start seeing dead people,
    <br>and those who were about to die in the family...
    <br>... and I could hear people fight sometimes.
    <br>I could even see things before they happened, or I could dream about things to happen,
    <br>and when they happened, it occurred exactly like in my dreams.
    <br>So this was all part of the evil power given to you by the mermaid?
    <br>Yes, exactly!
    <br>So, what then happened in your life?
    <br>Then in my life, basically, I had whatever I wanted to have, even though people didn't want to give it to me.
    <br>I would have the possibility to influence them to have what I want.
    <br>And when I had troubles, I had the power to dominate and get revenge.
    <br>And I didn't have to use much power; I just thought about it most of the time
    <br>and whatever I thought about you - having an accident - you would have it.
    <br>If I said bad things to you, you would have It.
    <br>And I was basically at some point forbidden to curse a person because it was really happening.
    <br>Later on, I used spells because I became more and more curious,
    <br>I wanted to know more so I went on the internet,
    <br>I ordered books, I entered cults.
    <br>At what age later did these powers really start manifesting and attracting people to you
    <br>and causing you to have different encounters with people?
    <br>At the age of 22, because then I started to understand what frustration, pain ,disappointment
    <br>and disloyal people mean.
    <br>I was like, "OK, since people are so disloyal, I'm going to start really using my powers on them."
    <br>I was speaking to the mermaid and sometimes she appeared to me in my dream to warn me,
    <br>or to ask me if I wanted anything.
    <br>She could help me to get powers as well.
    <br>I could also initiate people in a way.
    <br>OK, so when people would offend you or betray you or annoy you,
    <br>this is when you would use your powers to attack such a person?
    <br>Yes, but for the people that I truly loved; I didn't use it on them
    <br>because I understood that they were just making mistakes.
    <br>So, I forgave the people that I truly loved.
    <br>But the ones that didn't mean anything to me, I would come back at them definitely.
    <br>For instance, once a guy lied to me that he was single and then we went out together;
    <br>I put his house on fire basically, because he was fighting me with his wife and stuff like that.
    <br>After that I felt sorry, because the lady was 'cool' so I put them back together.
    <br>This power to attract and to seduce people - how did you start using that?
    <br>I started using that after my first breakup because I was disappointed.
    <br>After that I started using power on men, because the guy that I really loved was gone,
    <br>so I didn't feel any love for anybody anymore.
    <br>So it was basically like I needed to get revenge on everybody that was coming to me.
    <br>So, I started using it on them.
    <br>If you slept with me, sorry about what I'm going to say,
    <br>in my private part, your sperm was going to be swallowed by the snake that the mermaid gave me.
    <br>Because there was a snake in my stomach and its mouth was my private part -
    <br>so, any sperm that comes into it goes on the wall.
    <br>She actually uses your kids.
    <br>Later on you would have problems having babies or if you have babies,
    <br>they would all be imbeciles, like deformed, disabled kids.
    <br>They would be disabled or evil children, or you would not have any kids at all
    <br>because we already took everything from them.
    <br>If, for example, you are allowed to have two kids in the natural world;
    <br>then we would take them away from you - you would not have any kids anymore.
    <br>When you hurt my feelings, I would make you lose everything - your job;
    <br>anywhere you would go, there would be no 'openings' for you, no help, nothing.
    <br>People who used to help you would abandon you just because you offended me.
    <br>If you offended me, you would offend the mermaid because she loved me so much.
    <br>She was protecting me.
    <br>She was the one fighting for me.
    <br>OK, so tell us, this spirit of mermaid, did it also begin to give you assignments of who to meet or what to do?
    <br>Tell us about how that spirit started using you.
    <br>Yeah, she started sending me to do crazy things like drinking;
    <br>I wasn't drinking because I grew up as a church kid - I was always in Catholic schools.
    <br>For instance, she used to send me to nightclubs.
    <br>If I met somebody in the nightclub, we would sleep together; no feelings, nothing -
    <br>just for her to take whatever luck and wealth or good luck from him.
    <br>Sometimes she possessed me; it wasn't me so when you had sex with me,
    <br>you would feel like "wow! this is the best ever" -
    <br>but it wasn't me making love to you, it was the mermaid just using my body.
    <br>So, that was how she began to send you to go and destroy men,
    <br>not for anything other than just to destroy them?
    <br>Just to destroy, because I had all the money in the world because I was very wealthy.
    <br>I didn't need money from any man, I never went out for prostitution or something like that
    <br>because I had all the gold, all the money in the world.
    <br>But I needed to bring her servants and spirits and stuff like that.
    <br>It was like kind of food in a way, like slaves for her.
    <br>How did this situation get worse?
    <br>You said you kept looking for more power - what happened next?
    <br>Further frustration; for instance, once I left my stuff in a girl's garage because I was changing houses,
    <br>she asked me to help her with a visa situation.
    <br>Then I travelled and when I went there - because it concerned three people - the whole thing changed.
    <br>I told her but she didn't believe me.
    <br>So, she stole my stuff to make a point and I didn't fight her because I knew that it wasn't her fault.
    <br>It was the mermaid making a point because at that time I was getting tired of helping the mermaid,
    <br>feeling like, "That's not my portion, it wasn't my portion".
    <br>Then from there I started using my powers to get revenge.
    <br>I always heard this inner voice telling me "Don't do it, don't do this" -
    <br>because there was always a little voice of God calling me not to sin.
    <br>But it was more powerful than me, so I went higher and higher and I went to occult to get more powers,
    <br>with witches, wizards, pagans, kabbalah and everything - you name it.
    <br>I became a witch doctor because I could help and heal people.
    <br>I could even advise girls in the love area because men were not really faithful...
    <br>Sorry, when you say you became a witch doctor and you could do things for people -
    <br>would it be something that would actually benefit them
    <br>or is it not something that always had its own cost, its own repercussion?
    <br>Definitely it has a cost because whenever you enter a witch doctor's place, you don't go back the same.
    <br>When you enter, the mermaid is helping me to guide you, so I can tell you your whole life -
    <br>but it's not me, it's her powers through me, she's helping me, she's guiding me,
    <br>she's telling me what to say, where you are coming from, your history, your background,
    <br>and from this she's also stealing your life.
    <br>She's basically screening you and seeing what's good and what's not good,
    <br>is it necessary to talk to this person,
    <br>is this person already destroyed, or is she still worthy.
    <br>So you mean that all the help that you claim that you rendered to people is actually destruction in disguise?
    <br>Yeah! its destruction in disguise because your problems...
    <br>I gave you what you wanted for three, four days, sometimes a month
    <br>and then the next month you came back, with another problem,
    <br>because I took already your legs so it's only a bunch of problems.
    <br>You are going from one problem to another; every time you come there, it is a new thing.
    <br>So, how did it happen that you got yourself into it?
    <br>Were you initiated into this practice of witch doctoring, or how did it come about?
    <br>It came about because the mermaid was appearing to me.
    <br>She was also always asking me physically, because I could see her as anybody else.
    <br>She's like, "OK, at this grade, at this stage, you should now give me your blood
    <br>and I would give you all the powers."
    <br>I wasn't really keen for that, but sometimes she put me through situations where I didn't have a choice,
    <br>because I went from bad luck, to troubles to losing my fiancée,
    <br>to being so sad and nothing was working with my family - nobody...
    <br>I didn't have peace anymore because she made the point when she wanted something.
    <br>So, I had to accept it and then I went higher in grades.
    <br>So, I could even see disease in people without her.
    <br>When I became a witch doctor, I used to heal people.
    <br>I used to read cards, draw cards for people.
    <br>Sometimes I was telling girls to put three drops of their pee into the guy's tea
    <br>so when he drinks it, he is going to be in love with you.
    <br>I also used elements like, cards, books, bracelets, rings and everything for myself and for other people.
    <br>This bag has few items as well; it's just few items that I used - cards and books.
    <br>Basically I was a witch doctor.
    <br>OK, so you can bring out some of the items and show us the ones that you used,
    <br>the ones you made for people; and tell us how you went about it.
    <br>Basically, it's mixed black magic and white magic, spells and everything.
    <br>Nadine
    <br>Deliverance Testimony
    <br>This one here is the book that I used; they are angel cards.
    <br>We draw the cards to show people; to guide people with their lives, what's going on,
    <br>if things are well and stuff like that.
    <br>This is "archangel raphael", he is the "healing angel".
    <br>So, we use those cards...
    <br>So, this was how the evil spirits began to teach you how to use these cards to deceive people
    <br>into thinking that good things were happening whereas you were taking their good fortune,
    <br>destroying their destiny and so on?
    <br>Yes, exactly.
    <br>And this one here is the entrance book, if you wanted to become a rosicrucian.
    <br>You use this book and there you have all the papers and prices like entrance fees and stuff like that.
    <br>OK, so this was one of the cults you joined in order to get more powers?
    <br>Yeah, this is one of the cults to try to get more powers.
    <br>Show us what else is in the bag.
    <br>There's this belt - it was given to me by a powerful witch.
    <br>It is turning into a snake; it is supposed to turn into snake whenever you're in danger,
    <br>if somebody wants to attack you,
    <br>It is a protection; you attach it around your hips - it's helping you actually.
    <br>Yeah, this is the belt.
    <br>But it sucks blood actually so you don't see your period, for like six,
    <br>four months or two months and stuff like that.
    <br>So this is what you were telling us earlier that anything given by a witch or witch doctor,
    <br>although it might seem to have a benefit, it actually gives you a greater problem as well,
    <br>and that they claim this will give you protection, while at the same time
    <br>it started affecting your period and sucking your blood, is that right?
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>OK, what other items were you given?
    <br>I have this pendulum - it helps you to tell if this spirit is inside.
    <br>Normally, all the witches are using it to make sure the spirits are inside the room.
    <br>We use it when somebody comes to talk to a dead spirit.
    <br>So we can say "Yes", if it goes like this, or "No" if it goes like this, and "Maybe" if it goes like this.
    <br>So it helps you to locate the spirit in the room.
    <br>OK, so this is one of the items you would use when people would come to you
    <br>if they wanted to speak to the dead or do spells?
    <br>These are some of the items you used to help you in that?
    <br>Yes, with a crystal ball as well that I didn't bring here.
    <br>So this one here is the healing bracelet and for instance this is a tiger's eye here.
    <br>You can use it for different things, you can put it in water,
    <br>you can use this to heal yourself, or to bring good luck to yourself and to bring you like...
    <br>For instance, if you reach for something, you put it in water during the night
    <br>and then in the morning you wash with this water.
    <br>You take a normal bath and then this water from this tiger's eye,
    <br>you rinse yourself with it, you let it dry on your skin, you don't use your towel to dry up.
    <br>You let it dry and then wherever you go, it's going to help you.
    <br>It also protects against evil eye and evil spirits and bad energy.
    <br>OK, so all these bracelets are different forms of protection and like
    <br>charms for when you want to get something - this would help you to get that?
    <br>- Yeah.
    <br>- OK.
    <br>I also went to voodoo in Benin Republic.
    <br>They gave me this ring - it's a voodoo ring.
    <br>Whenever you need something, you do like this, and then you do this,
    <br>and then whatever you wish, you just ask.
    <br>If you feel to be in danger or pressured, if you are going for a business meeting -
    <br>because I'm a businesswoman as well -
    <br>it helps you to get whatever you want to get; it gives you power as well.
    <br>It's also related to the mermaid in a way - they call it a 'doll'.
    <br>There are also the 'serpata' and 'ifa'.
    <br>There are a lot of things charged in it; they put spirits...
    <br>I don't know all of them, but they put an energy that will help you and protect you.
    <br>It's silver, so it's against vampires and evil eye as well.
    <br>So basically this was another charm ring for protection as you were doing this work with the evil spirits?
    <br>Yes, exactly.
    <br>And this one is the blue moon stone ring; you charge it with the moonlight.
    <br>The first week of the month there is always moon so you take it and then you charge it under the moon.
    <br>You can put it in water or you can rinse it for 30 minutes, and then you put it in the place
    <br>where the light is flashing on the ring.
    <br>The silver as well is for protection.
    <br>This one is supposed to be one of the oldest in Sweden.
    <br>Whenever you feel in danger, specifically in danger of death, one of those things comes out.
    <br>It's really protecting you.
    <br>As you can see... I almost died in different places, so it is protecting you.
    <br>It doesn't come out easily, so it comes out with certain forces.
    <br>This necklace is like a charming necklace and protection as well.
    <br>Whenever you saw it on me, you would feel like "she's beautiful and stuff like that."
    <br>You would not see my real face, you would see somebody's else face like the mermaid's face.
    <br>You would see how beautiful I was, how gorgeous I was, because of this necklace.
    <br>It looks like a normal necklace, but it's not a normal necklace.
    <br>The one that I was using for others is one of these
    <br>because women love witchcraft for their marriage and their relationship.
    <br>So this one; you put the powder in the food.
    <br>Whenever the man was cheating or he doesn't want to give you anything,
    <br>he will be like a baby after you put it, and he will do everything you ask him to do.
    <br>So this one is used to bewitch men.
    <br>The man would do everything the woman wants and whenever he goes out, he can't 'get hard';
    <br>sorry about that.
    <br>He can't sleep with another woman, he will be faithful.
    <br>It will also make her husband not be able to go out in their marriage,
    <br>for people who are suspecting their husband of cheating on them?
    <br>Yeah! Even though he goes out with another woman, they will not have sexual encounter.
    <br>At that time he will not 'get hard'.
    <br>He will feel it, but it will not 'get hard'.
    <br>So, she would chase him away.
    <br>He would come back to his wife; only with his wife he can have an erection.
    <br>Another one is...
    <br>These ones as well...
    <br>This red one here; you put like a lemon in the middle of your hand
    <br>and then you do like this and then you lick it like that, and then you can call whoever you want,
    <br>and he will give you whatever you asked for.
    <br>What are the kind of things that you have asked for after doing this, after using this charm?
    <br>The woman goes back home.
    <br>If she was supposed to have twins, we take one of the kids or we take all the kids.
    <br>So, that's the price to pay.
    <br>She paid maybe - let's say 50$ - but she loses more than 50$.
    <br>They would ask for like the marriage to come back together, men to be crazy about them,
    <br> to buy cars, to build a house, to give them money.
    <br>Women want money for business and stuff like that, so they want money from men and the guy to be faithful.
    <br>But after using this charm what would they now lose, what would happen to them?
    <br>She would have the guy back, but they would lose all the money and everything
    <br>because we take everything and the guy would become poor.
    <br>She would destroy the guy's life actually without knowing it.
    <br>- By using this charm?
    <br>- Yeah.
    <br>After six months everything is going to go down.
    <br>She will leave the guy and everything is going to be bizarre.
    <br>It will just help you for a few days, a month, two months, three months,
    <br>and then you go back to zero, it will be worse than before.
    <br>I initiated twelve people because I was meeting even the devil himself sometimes.
    <br>He comes as a monster, sometimes as a gorgeous guy.
    <br>So, people really wanted to go fast.
    <br>There are people who come and ask you, "Oh I want girls to love me"
    <br>or "I want men to be crazy about me" -  even if she's not beautiful.
    <br>They will have to close themselves up indoors for seven days in the dark.
    <br>Then, on the Sunday...
    <br>They start on Monday, because it's the day of love.
    <br>So, you make any good wish on Monday, and the rest of the day is just sacrifice.
    <br>You speak to nobody, your phone is off.
    <br>So that was how you initiated many people into this habit of witch doctor - 12 people?
    <br>- Yeah.
    <br>- OK.
    <br>Tell us what was it that made you begin to get tired of this life
    <br>and finally you came here to receive your deliverance?
    <br>What got me tired was like - you don't have peace, you don't sleep at night,
    <br>she can come and wake you up at any time, and you hear people talking.
    <br>Whenever you walk on the street, you see people with coffins on their head, and you see people with diseases.
    <br>You can hear people's thoughts, so you become like a crazy person, because you can hear them.
    <br>On top of it, she asked me to sacrifice my firstborn.
    <br>She wanted me to fall pregnant, and then that baby would have to go for sacrifices.
    <br>Then I said no - it was enough!
    <br>So, how did you find out about The SCOAN and Prophet TB Joshua?
    <br>I found out about Prophet TB Joshua from my hair dresser and from my friend - Patrick.
    <br>He introduced me to the church and he asked me to go on The SCOAN website.
    <br>I went there and the first time I saw Senior Prophet's TB Joshua pictures -
    <br>it just came straight to my face like this...
    <br>I was looking at my computer and I didn't understand how it did happen.
    <br>How can it happen that he comes to me like that?
    <br>I fell actually on the floor and then when I woke up, I went back - it was different because I could see then.
    <br>I tried to watch one of the Church services and I saw fruits in the middle of the church...
    <br>I couldn't hear what he was saying - it was like "blah! blah! blah..."
    <br>I wondered, what was he saying, was he disabled or something?
    <br>And people were clapping and I couldn't hear him.
    <br>Then the mermaid appeared and she was so mad, and she said, "Turn it off! What are you looking at?"
    <br>I said, "I am looking at this man."
    <br>She said "No! No! No! Don't watch him."
    <br>She said, "Look! He's one of my servants."
    <br>I said, "Yeah, he has fruits."
    <br>Because when you are worshipping the mermaid, you have to keep fruits with you;
    <br>next to your bed, you pray on top of them.
    <br>In the morning, you give it away to beggars actually.
    <br>When I saw the fruits in the middle of the church, I thought like, "OK, while he is preaching,
    <br>the mermaid is helping him give testimonies.
    <br>Whenever he picks somebody, it is because the mermaid is telling him to pick the person
    <br>because that's what she does.
    <br>But you have to keep fruits because she loves fruits.
    <br>So you mean that as part of your worshipping of this mermaid spirit,
    <br>you always had to have fruits by your bed?
    <br>Yes, definitely! In the house, everywhere in the kitchen, in the room.
    <br>And when you gave this fruit, you said you would say an incantation over it?
    <br>Yeah, you do an incantation on it.
    <br>You do like... you can send...
    <br>She tells you, "You will have a fever, or ulcer, or something else tomorrow.
    <br>Put it on the fruit so that people can eat it."
    <br>Whoever eats that food will take that disease, that I was supposed to take.
    <br>Sometimes we killed a cow, we fried fish...
    <br>We did a party gathering, we cooked and we put all the diseases in the food.
    <br>Whoever was going to come to that party would eat my disease, or anybody else's disease.
    <br>So instead of what people thought you were doing - charity and giving out and being a nice person -
    <br>you were actually distributing sickness, pain, and problem?
    <br>Exactly! We were doing that; like you came to take our problems.
    <br>The problems we were supposed to have in 2016, you would take all of them from me.
    <br>If I was supposed to have an accident, one of those people would have an accident in my place.
    <br>If I was supposed to get an operation, somebody else would have that operation; so I would be fine.
    <br>But we had to do it every December each year.
    <br>OK, so you were telling us about how you were watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>and you couldn't hear what the man of God was saying.
    <br>What was that?
    <br>Was that an audio problem with your television or what?
    <br>No problem with my television.
    <br>It was the spirit actually who didn't allow me.
    <br>She didn't want me to listen to him because she knew I would be disconnected from her.
    <br>She didn't want me to watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I was always arguing with Patrick over the TV and over this Emmanuel TV 24/7.
    <br>We couldn't watch another program; only Emmanuel TV all the time - it was too much.
    <br>I couldn't stand it because the mermaid was attacking me, which he couldn't see.
    <br>It was difficult because basically everything I had was because she was blessing me with it.
    <br>She was spoiling me.
    <br>I didn't want to lose more and more things because of Emmanuel TV.
    <br>I didn't want to watch it.
    <br>But finally, by the grace of God, you were able to come to The SCOAN and last Sunday
    <br>you received your deliverance, when the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua prayed for you.
    <br>Tell us, what happened when you were in the service before the man of God prayed for you?
    <br>When we entered the church, I just fell asleep.
    <br>I didn't understand; it looked like I had drunk like a sleeping pill, because I was sleeping the whole time,
    <br>until I heard like chariots, like big angels' wings.
    <br>They woke me up; I was like, "Oh my God! what is this?"
    <br>And I told him, "Look! Who are those angels? What are they doing here?"
    <br>They were going around the church, and I was like, "Look, they are going around the church".
    <br>They were located...
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>It was a huge army - they were surrounding the whole church.
    <br>They entered noisily, because it woke me up, and I was like "Oh my God! What is this?"
    <br>They went all over the church; they were flying.
    <br>I was like, "Look Patrick! Can't you see?"
    <br>And he was like, "No. I'm not seeing."
    <br>I was like, "How can't he see? They are here."
    <br>He couldn't see.
    <br>They were checking the church to see if everything was fine, for the prophet to come in.
    <br>And one of the angels...
    <br>So, before the Prophet came here, they stopped here in the middle and then one of the angels stood in the front,
    <br>next to the fruits and said, "OK, you can come in five minutes."
    <br>So I told Patrick, "Prophet is coming here in five minutes" and he didn't believe me.
    <br>I told him, "Trust me, you will see - he will be here in five minutes."
    <br>Exactly five minutes later, the Prophet was here, and it was just weird.
    <br>Hallelujah, so this was a sign to you that truly you had come to a place
    <br>where you were going to receive your deliverance?
    <br>Yes, because I started wondering like, "What's going on?"
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>When the man of God came and prayed for you in the name of Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
    <br>We went to be touched.
    <br>While we were walking, I started hearing the voice of the evil saying, "Don't go. What are you doing?
    <br>They will put you... People are going to talk about you. You'll be ashamed, Don't go!"
    <br>And I was like, "No! Enough is enough. I want to be delivered."
    <br>I was shivering and shaking and I was feeling cold.
    <br>When I reached the man of God, he just touched me and then after that, I don't remember what happened.
    <br>I was just like fighting evil spirits in the dream.
    <br>And when I woke up, I was surprised to find myself here, because I didn't know where I was.
    <br>I was like, "Where am I? What is this place? Where are we?"
    <br>I couldn't find where to go when I came out.
    <br>And that's how you realized you have been delivered, is that right?
    <br>Yes, that's when I realized I have been delivered.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for the Lord Jesus!
    <br>So now it's been one week since you received your deliverance,
    <br>tell us - how are you now after the deliverance and how has your life changed?
    <br>After the deliverance, something popped out of my lips, because one of the powers as well was on my lips.
    <br>It just came out like blood and yellow stuff.
    <br>And out of my breast, the thing that men used to suck during sexual intercourse...
    <br>Because when they were sucking my breast, they felt like it was for pleasure,
    <br>but they were drinking a substance - a deadly substance actually.
    <br>That deadly substance just came out, like "poof", coming out like from an open tap.
    <br>So everything was coming out.
    <br>And from my private parts, a tongue that was basically doing this
    <br>just came out, so I couldn't suck any sperm anymore.
    <br>So you mean you're completely delivered?
    <br>I'm completely delivered.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>And these dreams and the voices of mermaids and things like that;
    <br>are you still being tormented by them or you are sleeping peacefully now?
    <br>No, she's talking now far away.
    <br>Last night I had a dream where she was like swimming in mud - it wasn't in water.
    <br>She was very mad and she was like, "Look what you did to us!
    <br>Because you left us, now we are suffering. You exposed us", and stuff like that.
    <br>Now, you have left them, you're completely free?
    <br>I'm completely free.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's put our hands for Jesus Christ.
    <br>So lastly, we want to hear - what is your word of advice to people watching you all over the world?
    <br>My word of advice is: guys, seriously, don't play with witchcraft.
    <br>It is not a game, and don't go to witch doctors.
    <br>Whenever you set your foot inside a witch doctor's house or office, you don't come back the same,
    <br>especially if it's a real witch.
    <br>You will lose your soul, you will lose your body and spirit, basically.
    <br>Some of them die, so don't go to witches.
    <br>Men: be careful of women - always bring her to church, because sometimes,
    <br>when we are frustrated, we become really evil.
    <br>It's good to bring your girl to the church, and it's always good to pray to God and to believe in God,
    <br>because He can deliver you from anything.
    <br>Amen! Let's put our hands together for Jesus one more time!
    <br>We rejoice with you for your deliverance and your complete freedom
    <br>and we want to encourage you: you are delivered by the Word of God,
    <br>so now, continue to make God's Word the standard for your life to maintain this deliverance
    <br>and the blessing that follows it, in Jesus name!
    <br>Amen!
