    <br>STANDARD FOR LIFE
    <br>Man of God, help me!
    <br>My name is Mathabo Ramphomane from South Africa.
    <br>I am addicted to eating soil, maize meal, paper, erasers and cloth.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me!
    <br>It started when it was raining outside and when I smelt the scent of the soil,
    <br>I felt like eating it.
    <br>These are the things I eat, Man of God. Please, help me!
    <br>For how long have you been eating these?
    <br>It has been ten years now, sir.
    <br>What efforts have you put in place to put an end to it?
    <br>I had tried many things, sir, but all to no avail.
    <br>Demonstrate to us how you have been eating it.
    <br>The cloth - I would take it and feel like putting it into my mouth.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Cloth
    <br>When it is wet, I would take it out.
    <br>This is the eraser that I eat.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Eraser
    <br>This is the paper, sir.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Paper
    <br>What is this?
    <br>It is the maize meal, sir.
    <br>Go ahead.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Maize Meal
    <br>What is the next item?
    <br>Soil.
    <br>What is this?
    <br>This is soil.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Soil
    <br>It tastes like normal food.
    <br>Do you like it?
    <br>Very much, sir.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Soil
    <br>I have been eating it for ten years, sir.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Soil, Maize Meal, Paper, Erasers and Cloth
    <br>Man of God, please help me.
    <br>That is why I am here; please help me!
    <br>I am from South Africa.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Soil, Maize Meal, Paper, Erasers and Cloth
    <br>Never a problem that Jesus Christ cannot solve.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Once you believe, you will receive your deliverance and freedom from this evil spirit.
    <br>I believe, sir.
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Speak out: Who are you?
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ! Speak out!
    <br>I am Lucifer.
    <br>I am Leviathan.
    <br>I am Numeral.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>How many of you are in her?
    <br>We are a legion.
    <br>How do you operate in this body?
    <br>The father gave her to us.
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>The father gave her to us! Can't you see?
    <br>Stand right and talk!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>What have you done to her so far?
    <br>Come here and answer me!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>Bring down your hand and answer me.
    <br>What have you done to her?
    <br>We took her since she was born and she served us.
    <br>She serves satan; she is a high priest. Who is supposed to fill that position?
    <br>Come back!
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Come back here!
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Stop!
    <br>Deliverance in Jesus' Name
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>What have you done to her career and health?
    <br>Nothing is showing for her.
    <br>How did you enter her body?
    <br>We took her when she was born.
    <br>What is your mission in this body?
    <br>She must come back!
    <br>To where?
    <br>She broke the code of the occult!
    <br>Where do you want her to come back to?
    <br>Where are you living?
    <br>We are in the spirit.
    <br>Speak louder.
    <br>We are in the spirit.
    <br>What are the evil things you have done so far? Mention them.
    <br>We cause confusion.
    <br>We gave her sicknesses.
    <br>We cause rejection.
    <br>We steal everything!
    <br>What have you done to the family members?
    <br>I have killed them; I have taken everything from them.
    <br>You said, "Everything". Mention them.
    <br>What are the things you have taken?
    <br>I broke their finances; I gave them sicknesses.
    <br>I caused confusion; I caused hatred.
    <br>I caused everything and I made sure they will not serve God.
    <br>They will serve us.
    <br>This body has been addicted to some things. Who caused it?
    <br>I did it, of course.
    <br>Speak louder.
    <br>I did, of course!
    <br>What do you want to gain?
    <br>Either she serves us, either she serves satan, or she will die.
    <br>How do you want to go about that?
    <br>I will make sure that she will always be confused.
    <br>She will never have a backbone. Do you hear me?
    <br>Do you hear me?
    <br>Apart from this body, what other evil things have you done to other people?
    <br>We destroyed them - the so-called pastors, Christians, businessmen,
    <br>marriages, everything - you mention them!
    <br>How do you go about destroying the so-called pastors?
    <br>We use her body.
    <br>How?
    <br>Explain how?
    <br>Why should I explain myself to you?
    <br>In the name of Jesus, speak out!
    <br>Stand up and answer me!
    <br>How?
    <br>We use her eyes.
    <br>How do you use her eyes and what happens when you use them?
    <br>So that when she sees things, we will also see it.
    <br>Anytime she enters a place, we are there; we are seeing with her.
    <br>Anything she sees, we will see it with her.
    <br>If she has plans, if she goes into a shop, if she goes anywhere, we will see with her.
    <br>You are talking about pastors. How do you go about using their body?
    <br>We use them.
    <br>How?
    <br>We shut their eyes.
    <br>And what happens to them?
    <br>They can't serve God; they can't see us.
    <br>They cannot see you people?
    <br>Yes, they can't.
    <br>They will only see light.
    <br>We will appear as light using her
    <br>but by the time we catch them, they won't know it.
    <br>You have said you have destroyed businessmen.
    <br>How do you go about that?
    <br>Anytime we go into their shops, we take the money; we buy with it.
    <br>How do you go to their shops?
    <br>We use spirits; we transport them.
    <br>We use bodies; some of them don't see us. We use them, indirectly.
    <br>What happens to their businesses and finances?
    <br>What do you think?
    <br>Answer me!
    <br>They fall!
    <br>What do you gain in doing that?
    <br>It's our kingdom.
    <br>The more we kill people, the more we destroy, the more we gain.
    <br>Alright?
    <br>What do you gain?
    <br>We gain their spirits,
    <br>we gain ownership of them.
    <br>What is your mission here?
    <br>I don't know how this girl came.
    <br>Speak louder!
    <br>I don't know how this girl came.
    <br>We tried killing her in the air but we couldn't.
    <br>How did you try to kill her in the air? What did you do?
    <br>We gathered the principalities  when they reached the sea, to kill her.
    <br>Why is it that you don't like the name Jesus?
    <br>What has that name been doing to you people?
    <br>Because we are darkness;
    <br>we don't mix with light.
    <br>Anytime you mention that name, it destroys us; we cannot operate.
    <br>So, that name is light?
    <br>Yes!
    <br>And it destroys you people?
    <br>It's fire! It's burning me!
    <br>Now, she is here.
    <br>Why is it that you do not like The Synagogue Church of All Nations?
    <br>This girl has been following Prophet T.B. Joshua since 1998.
    <br>She wanted to come here but we stopped her.
    <br>This year, a stupid boy from nowhere gave her money.
    <br>She will watch Emmanuel TV the whole night and we cannot operate.
    <br>She will watch what?
    <br>She will watch the Prophet.
    <br>She will pray; she will do everything.
    <br>She will put him on her phone, everything.
    <br>When she watches the Prophet, what happens to you and your colleagues?
    <br>We can't see; we can't walk; we can't do anything.
    <br>Which prophet does she watch?
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>What is in Prophet T.B. Joshua that is destroying you people?
    <br>He is light.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Now she has come here, what do you want to do?
    <br>We will kill her.
    <br>How?
    <br>She will never release the secret.
    <br>What is the secret?
    <br>Speak out!
    <br>We put a snake inside her.
    <br>What is the purpose of the snake?
    <br>It is a part of lucifer in her;
    <br>we can locate her everywhere.
    <br>But now that she is here, the snake will go.
    <br>When the snake goes, what will happen?
    <br>She will be free.
    <br>How many of you have been working with her?
    <br>Millions.
    <br>We keep inviting.
    <br>We are only disturbed when she prays with you people.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>What happens to you people when she prays with Emmanuel TV?
    <br>We cannot operate.
    <br>I told you; we can't operate.
    <br>We become stuck; we can't see.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I'm Numeral.
    <br>I'm Lucifer.
    <br>I'm Leviathan.
    <br>Manifestation of Evil Spirits
    <br>Your end has come.
    <br>Right now.
    <br>I'm warning you.
    <br>Why?
    <br>I destroyed many of them who had tried.
    <br>Be free!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Set Free in Jesus' Name
    <br>How are you?
    <br>I'm fine, sir.
    <br>You were telling us something that you normally eat these as normal food.
    <br>Can you identify them and taste them?
    <br>It is soil, maize meal, cloth, eraser and paper.
    <br>Ok. Go ahead.
    <br>Set Free From an Addiction to Eating Soil, Maize Meal, Cloth, Paper and Erasers
    <br>What is happening to you?
    <br>It doesn't have a taste.
    <br>It doesn't taste good anymore?
    <br>Take more. Take other ones.
    <br>Set Free From an Addiction to Eating Soil, Maize Meal, Cloth, Paper and Erasers
    <br>What is happening?
    <br>It is irritating, sir.
    <br>Ok. Take other ones.

    <br>What is happening?
    <br>It is too dry.
    <br>What about the paper?

    <br>Do you like it?
    <br>No.
    <br>The Lord has set you free.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Wash your mouth.
    <br>Wash your mouth and then go and eat normal food.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I'm free!
    <br>Set Free From an Addiction to Eating Soil, Maize Meal, Cloth, Paper and Erasers
    <br>Glory be to God.
    <br>After Miss Mathabo's deliverance from the addiction to eating soil, maize meal,
    <br>paper, erasers and cloth, she is given a cup of water to rinse her mouth
    <br>and is also served with a delicious meal of rice, salad and chicken.
    <br>This is the evidence that she is indeed free from the addiction
    <br>and now has appetite for normal food.
    <br>As she eats, she waves her hand in appreciation to what God Almighty has done in her life.
    <br>"Thank You, Jesus Christ" is a response from a happy heart.

    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Mathabo Ramphomane
    <br>and I am from South Africa.
    <br>I am 28 years old.
    <br>The problem that brought me to The SCOAN was
    <br>an addiction to eating soil, paper, erasers, clothes and maize meals.
    <br>Man of God, help me.
    <br>My name is Mathabo Ramphomane from South Africa.
    <br>I am addicted to eating soil, maize meal, paper, erasers and cloth.
    <br>Please, Man of God, help me
    <br>It started when it was raining outside and when I smelt the scent of the soil,
    <br>I felt like eating it.
    <br>These are the things that I eat, Man of God. Please help me!
    <br>For how long have you being eating these?
    <br>It has been ten years now, sir.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Cloth
    <br>When it is wet, I will take it out.
    <br>This is the eraser that I eat.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Eraser
    <br>This is the paper, sir.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Paper
    <br>What is this?

    <br>Go ahead.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Maize Meal
    <br>What is the next item?
    <br>Soil.
    <br>What is this?
    <br>This is soil.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Soil
    <br>It tastes like normal food, sir.
    <br>Do you like it?
    <br>Very much, sir.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Soil
    <br>I have been eating it for ten years, sir.
    <br>Addicted to Eating Soil, Maize Meal, Paper, Erasers and Cloth
    <br>Man of God, please help me!
    <br>That is why I am here; please help me.
    <br>I am from South Africa.
    <br>Last week, I was delivered through Wise Man Christopher.
    <br>Immediately the Wise Man started delivering me, the spirit started operating inside me.
    <br>The spirits of lucifer, leviathan and numeral started to manifest.
    <br>The spirit of lucifer is the spirit that is anti-Jesus, anti-Christ.
    <br>It is the spirit that causes conflict, confusion and all the horrible things
    <br>that you see happening in the world.
    <br>The second spirit that operated in me was the spirit of leviathan.
    <br>The spirit of leviathan is the old, ancient demon
    <br>that is responsible for all the marine activities.
    <br>For example, the spiritual husbands.
    <br>It operates the mermaids and the snakes that are in the rivers.
    <br>Most people don't know of those things but they do exist
    <br>and they all fall under the king, leviathan.
    <br>The third spirit that was operating in me was the spirit of numeral.
    <br>The spirit of numeral is the spirit that has all the statistics of the world
    <br>because it operates with numbers and the alphabet.
    <br>The reason being, that everything that is done in this world is
    <br>done using numbers and the alphabet.
    <br>Whether you code a name or you name a product,
    <br>everything will be done with regards to numbers and the alphabet.
    <br>So, it works mainly with possessing the minds of the people
    <br>and connecting to them through their names and numbers.
    <br>For example, on your ID, your birthdate has numbers
    <br>and your name has the alphabet so that was how satan would use the spirit of numeral
    <br>to get the database of the world.
    <br>I was trained by satan to sit in the cabinet because there is a protocol in the spiritual realm.
    <br>There is the trinity of satan.
    <br>The trinity of satan is satan, the beast and the false prophet.
    <br>The second step is the principalities, the powers, the rulers and the lords.
    <br>that rule the universe, including the world.
    <br>There are continental demons who monitor every single continent
    <br>and they are responsible for monitoring every single activity that goes on in the continent.
    <br>There are supervising demons who get directives from the continental demons
    <br>to guard every single area of the world - whether in the land, air or sea.
    <br>Then there are senior demons - those who are monitoring
    <br>towns,  cities, and all the other areas within the continents.
    <br>Then we have junior demons who follow each and every human being.
    <br>Whether rich, young, old, the junior demons monitor will everything about those people
    <br>and they make sure to connect with the minds of people, to torment them.
    <br>They will cause things like the spirits of lying, lust, anger, bitterness, laziness.
    <br>All those spirits will be monitoring the minds of the people
    <br>and they will influence them.
    <br>They are regarded as the most important demons
    <br>because they are the ones who are involved in the day-to-day activities of human beings
    <br>and they have the power to invite worse demons than them.
    <br>So, the tools that the enemy would be using -
    <br>he would use every single mode of communication that human beings use.
    <br>For example, he can use music, the internet, 'men of God';
    <br>he can use every single person, the stakeholders in the community and world.
    <br>For example, the 'men of God', he would use them by making them to crave power instead of grace.
    <br>Because he would make sure that every single time they become famous,
    <br>and their churches and everything about them grows,
    <br>they would crave for more power and they would have pride.
    <br>At that time when they have pride, the evil spirits will come in and supply them with power
    <br>Now because of the pride, they would be blinded and not see the source of the power.
    <br>They would also use the people around the man of God.
    <br>If at all they cannot reach the man of God, they would use, for example, the children of the man of God,
    <br>the wife, the pastors, or other denominations in the church.
    <br>They would make sure that they caused frustration.
    <br>You would find that the pastor's children are wayward.
    <br>It is those spirits that are monitoring them, making sure that the man of God is frustrated.
    <br>They would always have no time with God.
    <br>They would always be frustrated and try to solve problems.
    <br>At the end of the day, the protection is gone, and they would enter and destroy the man of God.
    <br>We use fornication.
    <br>Fornication in the sense that when you are sleeping with somebody, there is a transfer of blood.
    <br>The time you sleep with someone - whether a prostitute or anyone else
    <br>that is not of the same religion as you, or just sleeping with anybody,
    <br>you will transfer blood into that person, and they will transfer blood into you.
    <br>If a man of God sleeps with a prostitute, the minute you sleep with them,
    <br>she would go and report back to the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>Whenever that prostitute, or whoever you slept with, is promoted in rank,
    <br>the man of God would be taken along with her.
    <br>That is why you find many men of God are destroyed today.
    <br>They are possessed but they are not aware of it
    <br>because they thought that they only slept with the person.
    <br>The internet - how they use the internet:
    <br>There are certain websites that they would post,
    <br>for example, music, pictures and the latest gadgets people use.
    <br>For example, they would use a picture:
    <br>You would not necessarily know that that picture is evil
    <br>but they would know that it is very evil.
    <br>We connect it with you if, for example, you have a weakness of laziness,
    <br>that demon in the picture on the internet will connect with your laziness
    <br>so that minute you look at that picture, it would invite more spirits
    <br>who would be transferred in you.
    <br>Many people don't know that the things that are posted on the internet have spirits;
    <br>they don't just act alone.
    <br>They act with spirits inside them.
    <br>Music - how we transfer music:
    <br>Music is a crowd puller; many artists are crowd pullers.
    <br>Artists that belong to the kingdom of darkness, the kingdom of satan,
    <br>any lyrics and songs are not sent alone but go with spirits.
    <br>Whenever you listen to their music, the lyrics may not say, 'satan',
    <br>but within them, because of the authority they are given in the kingdom of darkness,
    <br>they would transfer spirits and connect with your spirit.
    <br>If you don't have protection, they would possess you.
    <br>Many people are not aware that many artists belong to the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>We were in a meeting with the cohorts of the devil in hell.
    <br>So, this man came - I didn't know it was Jesus.
    <br>He was wearing a robe - it was red and looked like it was dipped inside blood.
    <br>It had a golden rope on this side.
    <br>He had holes in His hands and feet.
    <br>His face looked like somebody had beaten Him up.
    <br>He looked almost disfigured; you couldn't recognise Him.
    <br>He had a crown made of thorns on His head.
    <br>The minute I saw this man, I developed a curiosity to know Him
    <br>because whenever He came, everything would stop.
    <br>Not even Satan could move; he would just stop right there.
    <br>I went to Him, and when I touched Him, when He looked at my side, I felt love and compassion,
    <br>and those things I was not related to.
    <br>That's what made me decide to exit the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>Physically, I confessed to my mother that I had been serving satan.
    <br>Because she did not understand, my mother now called different pastors
    <br>to come and pray for me.
    <br>Most of the time, when they would pray for me, the spirits inside me would despise the man of God
    <br>because they would see that he had not gotten to the level I was at that time.
    <br>Many men of God that tried to pray for me were destroyed.
    <br>Some of them were fornicating, others were drunkards.
    <br>One day, my brother gave us the video cassette of Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>The first time I saw the prophet of God, I said to my mother,
    <br>"I have to meet this man; I believe this man can help me.
    <br>I believe he is the only one who can help me".
    <br>That is when I tried to come - since 1998, I have been trying to get here.
    <br>Recently, I was able to come to The SCOAN.
    <br>The men of God that came to deliver you - are you the one that attacked them, or was it your people?
    <br>It was the people that I was serving that were attacking the men of God
    <br>because I wanted to go out of the kingdom.
    <br>I was battling between me and them.
    <br>Anytime I would see the men of God, I would start to attack and did not have control over it.
    <br>They did not have a flame, light, or fire around them like the genuine men of God
    <br>or angels guarding them.
    <br>So, many of them are true men of God, but for most of them,
    <br>at each stage, they would use their weaknesses;
    <br>that is why they were not able to deliver me.
    <br>Is there anyone that could not deliver you, and you could not deliver them?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>So, anybody that could not deliver you, you would deliver them?
    <br>Yes, sir
    <br>How did you deliver them?
    <br>Mainly, it was because they did not have the protection around them.
    <br>So, anytime they would pray for me, it would be as though I was delivered
    <br>but deep down I would know that I was not fully delivered.
    <br>I was still having the connection with the kingdom of darkness.
    <br>They would attack the men of God, causing confusion and frustration.
    <br>For some of them, they would break their marriages,
    <br>and cause havoc around the men of God who were trying to deliver me.
    <br>As a chief priest, I would get directives from satan to give assignments
    <br>to different levels of demonic forces, for example, to cause accidents, kill people
    <br>and cause havoc in the world.
    <br>The main reason why we were causing accidents and killing people
    <br>was because we ate human flesh and drank human blood.
    <br>The reason for eating human flesh and drinking human blood
    <br>was because life is in the blood.
    <br>We would eat that blood and flesh to gain more life and superiority over demons and human beings.
    <br>Every time I would watch the man of God through Emmanuel TV at home -
    <br>I would spend the night watching it and praying with the man of God, Senior Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>Every time I would watch him, there would be peace inside me.
    <br>I decided to come because the difference between the man of God and all the other people,
    <br>who were trying to deliver me in the past,
    <br>is that the man of God is very humble and simple.
    <br>He has a heart for people and genuine love for people.
    <br>That is what brought me here.
    <br>Other people, when their ministry begins to grow, and they see God using them,
    <br>they become big headed and develop pride.
    <br>At the end of the day, it is all about them and not about God.
    <br>That is how I got to The SCOAN.
    <br>Now you are delivered.
    <br>The minute a child is born, in the kingdom of darkness,
    <br>they would take the bag containing the baby (placenta)
    <br>and make incantations and curse the child's life.
    <br>You would find that the child is initiated from birth.
    <br>That is why small children can kill big people.
    <br>People would wonder how they did it.
    <br>Parents should be conscious of what happens to their children.
    <br>I would advise everybody to be in the Lord Jesus
    <br>and to accept Him as their personal Lord and Saviour.
    <br>Without that, there is no protection, and they would suffer affliction from the enemy.
    <br>People of God, never take anything for granted
    <br>because satan can use anything and everything,
    <br>even things you think he cannot use.
    <br>People should seek the grace of God, instead of the power they are craving for
    <br>because you don't know the source of the power that you are going to get.
    <br>Wow! Thank you very much. Did you listen to that?
    <br>She said people seek power, and the Bible says, "Behold, I have given you power" already.
    <br>You are already born with power.
    <br>It is in you.
    <br>We cannot be greater than our processing.
    <br>Build this faith by hearing the Word.
    <br>When you hear the Word of God and obey it, faith grows.
    <br>So that faith is now the object to release the power.
    <br>That is the key
    <br>The switch.
    <br>You have a switch like this.
    <br>I want to switch this on.
    <br>It's easy. I switch it on.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>I switch it on.
    <br>She is telling us that talking about power, you have the power.
    <br>But it is faith - by hearing the Word of God and obeying it, you have faith.
    <br>Your life will run smoother when you go by the Book.
    <br>Thank you, Man of God, I am free, and I am free forever, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Ok, since your deliverance, what are your experiences whilst sleeping?
    <br>Before now, when I was at home, even my mother would fight because I would not sleep.
    <br>But since then, I have been sleeping very well, sir.
    <br>Before now, I could not balance between the physical life and spiritual life.
    <br>But now I can see that everything is finished, and now I am free in Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>So what of your people?
    <br>Because, you are conscious of what you were doing.
    <br>This consciousness - there are many that are not conscious of what they are doing.
    <br>They possess them.
    <br>When they finish delivering them and tell them, "This is what you said", they say "No, I'm not the one".
    <br>But you - you were conscious of what you were doing.
    <br>You were there, you knew what you were doing.
    <br>You would do it physically.
    <br>Spiritually - yes, you were there.
    <br>How do you bring them to the light?
    <br>I will meet them and tell them the truth of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <br>Today, 90% of these people are not conscious of what they are doing.
    <br>The moment they finish delivering them, and they are told, "You said this",
    <br>they will say, "No, over my dead body. I could never say that".
    <br>"You said you are doing it." - "No!"
    <br>"You said you are a snake" - "Snake? I'm a human being."
    <br>It means that they are not conscious of what they are doing.
    <br>Whereas 10% of them, like this sister, are conscious of what they are doing.
    <br>They are the possessors.
    <br>They afflicted the other people.
    <br>By attack, they can afflict you, and be using you and you would not know.
    <br>They will just take your image, go wherever they go, and do whatever they want to do.
    <br>Anybody that is crying there - the spiritualists see the people that attack them.
    <br>They will not see the people that use that image.
    <br>That is why today they keep attacking the wrong people.
    <br>They call the  wrong people witches in the village and community.
    <br>Many people accused of being witches and wizards are not witches and wizards.
    <br>They are being afflicted.
    <br>The people that are witches and wizards, they are somewhere, hiding somewhere.
    <br>Even by the time people attack the accused witches and wizards, they will come and join them to attack.
    <br>This world is not my home
    <br>I'm just passing through
    <br>My treasures are laid up
    <br>Somewhere beyond the blue
    <br>The angels beckon me
    <br>From Heaven's open door
    <br>And I can't feel at home
    <br>In this world anymore
