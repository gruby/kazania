  <p>    
    <br>Wise Man Daniel, filled with the Holy Spirit, ministers spirit prayer in power, in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>at the prayer line section of The SCOAN.
    <br>It is the word on the lips of the believer that changes situations,
    <br>that breaks yokes, that loosens chains.
    <br>As he moved along praying for the people
    <br>an exuberant quantum of lightning from heaven descends upon them.
    <br>And among them is this lady, whom the evil spirit possessing her body
    <br>is unable to comprehend or challenge the omnipotent power of Jesus Christ.
    <br>Let's watch what happens next.
    <br>All over you body - fire!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>You cannot resist it.
    <br>From your head to your toes - fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>All over your body - fire!
    <br>Speak out, who are you!
    <br>- What have you done to her career?
    <br>- We want to kill her.
    <br>- Why do you want to kill her?
    <br>- Because she wants to bring light to the family.
    <br>Who is she to deliver the family?
    <br>- How many of you are in this body?
    <br>- The evil soul, idol and the mother goddess.
    <br>The idol, the evil soul and the mother goddess.
    <br>- As the idol, what have you done to her?
    <br>- We have caged her.
    <br>- How did you cage them, explain.
    <br>- None of them will get married.
    <br>Poverty.
    <br>She is the only one who tried to escape it.
    <br>We have brought her down again. She is down! She will not rise again.
    <br>She is down. We made her to sell all she has.
    <br>Her house she built for 10 million naira has been sold recently because of her daughter.
    <br>We just had to torment her; we are using her daughter to torment her.
    <br>- What have you done to her career already?
    <br>- She is nothing - zero.
    <br>- What is this on her body?
    <br>- That is my symbol.
    <br>- What does it represent?
    <br>- The mother goddess.
    <br>As a 'mother goddess' what do you do to her? Why did you allow to do this?
    <br>We sold her to prostitute.
    <br>- Where?
    <br>- In Greece.
    <br>- How many men does she meet in a day?
    <br>- Uncountable.
    <br>- This is the girl we are after.
    <br>- You are after this lady?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now, she has come to take her daughter who we are using to torment her but I will not let her go.
    <br>- Who is this lady?
    <br>- That is her daughter.
    <br>- How are you?
    <br>- I am fine.
    <br>- Who is she to you?
    <br>- She is my mother.
    <br>What do you have to say about her?
    <br>She gets angry a lot and she thinks a lot and it makes her to faint.
    <br>- She is easily angered?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>And she thinks a lot?
    <br>Sometimes she faints and they will take her to the hospital.
    <br>Right now, you demon, out of this body!
    <br>Fire, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>From your head to your toes, you 'river goddess', come out of her!
    <br>Out, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In Jesus' name.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>You are free, rise up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>- How are you?
    <br>- I'm fine.
    <br>Can you remember what happened to you a moment ago?
    <br>Nothing happened to me.
    <br>You mum is free.
    <br>Give thanks to God, you are free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! 
    <br>We are delivered.
    <br>DELIVERANCE CONTINUES
    <br>At The SCOAN's prayer line Wise Man Harry prays for the people in the mighty name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>setting them free from the bondage of satan and all his destruction.
    <br>Let's watch and see the encounter between him and this young girl,
    <br>who instantly reacts to his touch of fire.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>A spiritual husband.
    <br>- What have you done to her?
    <br>- I have destroyed her.
    <br>- In what way have you destroyed her?
    <br>- I blocked her brain.
    <br>I make her to be chasing men.
    <br>Why did you do that to her?
    <br>- She has a bright future.
    <br>- Because she has a bright future.
    <br>Open your eyes, look here.
    <br>Who is this woman to you?
    <br>Her mother.
    <br>- OK madam, how are you?
    <br>- I am fine, sir.
    <br>- Who is this lady to you?
    <br>- She is my daughter.
    <br>What can you say about her?
    <br>I left her at the age of seven years when I travelled to Europe for prostitution.
    <br>They used to call me and say that she always runs out of the house
    <br>and that she dropped out of school.
    <br>When I came, I met her on the street.
    <br>I didn't meet her at my sister's house where I had left her.
    <br>You mean, you met her on the street?
    <br>I met her on the street doing prostitution, the same thing;
    <br>that was the spirit I was delivered from last week.
    <br>Man of God please, she is too young for this.
    <br>Help me, I can't help myself. Please, that is why I brought her here.
    <br>- Please.
    <br>- OK.
    <br>- How did you enter her body, you demon?
    <br>- When she was seven years old.
    <br>Now it is time for you to go, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Out of her, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out, you demon!
    <br>This is not your temple.
    <br>In the name of Jesus, out of her!
    <br>Out!
    <br>In Jesus' name!
    <br>Come out!
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You are free.
    <br>Stand up.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>- How are you?
    <br>- I am fine.
    <br>- OK. Do you remember what you said?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- Who is this woman to you?
    <br>- She is my mother.
    <br>Madam, you listened to this; all what she was saying - she was not the one talking.
    <br>That evil spirit that was pushing her to do those things is out.
    <br>So you should not blame her for anything, so that you will not be tempted.
    <br>- She is free.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Thank You for delivering my daughter!
    <br>Thank You for delivering us!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>My name is Vera Benjamin. I'm from Nigeria, I live in Europe.
    <br>She is my daughter.
    <br>I want to thank God for delivering me from the spirit of prostitution.
    <br>My testimony goes like this: I came from a very poor family.
    <br>The poverty was so much; my mother could not afford a meal for us.
    <br>One day, a man who my mother owed 300 naira
    <br>came to ask for his money.
    <br>My mother could not afford it.
    <br>He met my mother while cooking and threw the food away.
    <br>He beat my mother and stripped her naked and laughed at her.
    <br>I felt bad.
    <br>Later on, I ran after the man.
    <br>I went to him, begging,
    <br>"Please, what can I do to remove this shame from my mother?"
    <br>He said that I wasn't too young that I should give myself to him.
    <br>That was how I gave myself to him and he took my virginity.
    <br>He then gave me the 300 naira for my mother.
    <br>I realised that if I gave myself to a man and he would give us money,
    <br>that meant that our poverty would be over.
    <br>So, I continued going out with this guy.
    <br>He would give me money until a day a friend came to me and said that what I was doing
    <br>would not be in my favour, they would laugh at me
    <br>and that she would take me to another place.
    <br>She took me to another city and from there to Abuja.
    <br>She introduced me to a five star hotel; I became a classic prostitute.
    <br>In that five star hotel, before I could enter, I must enter with a man.
    <br>I met the father of my baby and he would be the one to escort me.
    <br>When we went inside, I would meet a lot of men.
    <br>When I signalled any man and he gave me a sign to come with him,
    <br>I would give the father of my baby money to go.
    <br>He would leave and I would sleep with the other man.
    <br>They would pay me a good amount of money.
    <br>From there, I was moving with different kinds of men - big men who had a lot of money.
    <br>There was a time I travelled home.
    <br>When I went home, I saw that my town had changed.
    <br>There were different houses, new buildings - the environment everywhere had changed.
    <br>I asked my mother what was happening.
    <br>She said that all the girls travelled to Europe to make money
    <br>and that was how they helped their families.
    <br>I went to meet one of them.
    <br>She introduced me to a man who took me to Europe.
    <br>Before I went there, the woman asked me to pay 50,000 naira for registration
    <br>and 10,000 naira to take an oath before leaving.
    <br>I gave her.
    <br>When we got to the shrine, they asked me to bring something.
    <br>They took my hair, armpit hair, my fingernails and toenails,
    <br>my pubic hair, my underwear and my photo.
    <br>They took the oath.
    <br>After that, I left with the man.
    <br>When we got to the country we were supposed to go to,
    <br>the man refused and said that I would seduce him,
    <br>so he sold me to another lady for 55,000 euro.
    <br>This lady took me to another country, where I started doing prostitution.
    <br>When we got to the country, we went to her house; there were a lot of girls there.
    <br>She called the senior girl to dress me up.
    <br>They dressed me.
    <br>She then gave me a packet of 50 condoms.
    <br>She warned me that I must make sure that I slept with 50 men
    <br>and that I finish the 50 condoms before coming home.
    <br>I had no option; I had to go.
    <br>When we got to the place, I was expecting something different.
    <br>When I got there, I don't know how to describe it,
    <br>it is like from this junction to the end - full of girls.
    <br>They were naked, with their breasts and bottoms out.
    <br>There was nothing I could do, I had to join them.
    <br>First of all, I asked one of them how they did it and what the rate was.
    <br>She said that each man for 30 minutes is about 25 to 30 euros
    <br>and that I must make sure that I finish the 50 condoms before coming home.
    <br>If I came home without finishing the 50 condoms, she would send me back.
    <br>That was how I continued.
    <br>That very day, I became so tired; I worked the whole night.
    <br>The second day, I was so tired; she still forced me to go.
    <br>When I got there, I met a man.
    <br>I was crying and this man came.
    <br>He said, "I know your problem, you are new. Let me tell you what to do.
    <br>If you want to make money the way the other girls are making it, you must be addicted to something."
    <br>He took me inside the room for 30 minutes for 30 euro.
    <br>He taught me how to smoke drugs - white, brown, marijuana, cigarettes
    <br>and how to drink alcohol.
    <br>When I took those drugs, there was much power within me to deal with any man.
    <br>Even if I had sex with 50 men, I wouldn't be tired because I was on drugs.
    <br>That was how I continued.
    <br>If we were on our menstruation, we must go.
    <br>If we were sick, we must go.
    <br>She had no pity for anybody.
    <br>I was sleeping with 50 men and sometimes, I would meet bad people.
    <br>I met bad people; they would beat me.
    <br>In the rain, I was there. In the snow, when it was winter, I was there.
    <br>In the summer, there were police, we would be there.
    <br>This woman insisted we must not come home until we finished the 50 condoms.
    <br>That was how I continued; I would be sleeping with 50 men.
    <br>Within eight months, I made the 55,000 euro and I gave it to her.
    <br>I was free from her.
    <br>I had to start going on my own.
    <br>I was making money sleeping with different kinds of men.
    <br>I would take drugs. I would use 1,000 euro a day to take drugs.
    <br>I would get myself high before I slept with men.
    <br>If a man came to take me to his home,
    <br>when I got there, I would see a lot of men - 12 to 15 men
    <br>and they would all sleep with me.
    <br>Some would take my money.
    <br>They would leave me or they would drop me at a very far distance,
    <br>where I would not know the way to my home.
    <br>I continued like that; I was making money.
    <br>I was sending money home to my family to take care of them.
    <br>They were building a house - doing all kinds of things for me - buying property.
    <br>My sister then understood that there was money in doing prostitution.
    <br>My three sisters are into prostitution.
    <br>I was sending money to them to do things for me until the day I decided to come home.
    <br>When I came home, I first of all went to Ghana.
    <br>My daughter was staying in Abuja before at boarding school.
    <br>I invested money there but she was not OK there.
    <br>I took her to Ghana to stay with my sister to study.
    <br>When I came home, I went to Ghana.
    <br>When I came, I didn't meet my daughter at home. I met her on the street.
    <br>That night, I was looking for her; I didn't see her.
    <br>My sister said that this was how she used to go out, that she didn't stay at home.
    <br>I was looking for her around midnight; I saw her and brought her home.
    <br>In my presence, three times she ran away.
    <br>She went out to sleep with men - she was doing the same prostitution.
    <br>She would go out and sleep with men.
    <br>Before I brought her here, I tied her because I didn't want her to escape again.
    <br>I tied her with a rope.
    <br>I started prostitution at the age of 13; she started at the age of 12.
    <br>"I Slept With 50 Men A Night..." - CONFESSIONS OF A PROSTITUTE
    <br>I had to tie her for her not to run away.
    <br>I knew there was something wrong.
    <br>OK, let me ask her: Little girl, why should you be tied before coming here? What's the problem?
    <br>Because I used to run away from the house.
    <br>Why?
    <br>Anytime I was at home, something used to talk to me
    <br>that I should go out to meet my friends - go to clubs, parties and sleep with men.
    <br>- How old are you?
    <br>- I am 12 years old.
    <br>So something used to tell you that you should go out and sleep with men?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>She is 12 years old.
    <br>And you have been doing that for some time now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So, can you see what has happened now?
    <br>Unlike before, she sees it as a way of life.
    <br>But now she is delivered, she hates it.
    <br>When you are not disconnected from the chain satan used to connect you to himself,
    <br>you will not see anything wrong in what you are doing.
    <br>But the moment you are disconnected from the chain satan used to connect you to himself,
    <br>you will begin to say, "Wow. Why should I do this?"
    <br>You will begin to blame yourself, condemning your past.
    <br>That is exactly what has happened now.
    <br>Many would say, "Why should this woman say this? Look at her appearance."
    <br>Yes, she says this because she hates it.
    <br>Now she doesn't want to go back to it, she is taking her family...
    <br>These are generational curses.
    <br>Where are your sisters, where are they?
    <br>Man of God, they're in different countries; I don't know anything about them.
    <br>What happened after your deliverance, and when the Wise Man touched you?
    <br>What happened to you?
    <br>Because you never came here for that kind of deliverance, you were here for prayer,
    <br>but different thing now happened, because you saw it as a normal thing.
    <br>You were here for prayer, but after touching you,
    <br>you began to say what you were not expecting to say.
    <br>Now tell us, when they touched you, what happened to you?
    <br>Man of God, I brought my daughter here for deliverance.
    <br>Oh! Did you listen to that?
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>You see?
    <br>She said she came here, she brought her daughter for deliverance,
    <br>herself - she doesn't need deliverance, because she is a big girl, she has arrived.
    <br>"No. There is nothing bad about what I'm doing. I have built a house.
    <br>I have a house. I take care of the family. I'm OK. So I don't need deliverance."
    <br>She came here with her daughter; she thought her daughter needed deliverance,
    <br>not knowing that herself...
    <br>Oh. Clap for Jesus.
    <br>"I Slept With 50 Men A Night..." - CONFESSIONS OF A PROSTITUTE
    <br>I brought my daughter here for deliverance.
    <br>At the prayer line, Wise Man Daniel prayed for us.
    <br>I was the one who manifested.
    <br>After my deliverance...
    <br>Man of God, I must speak the truth.
    <br>I had never found happiness; no peace.
    <br>After my deliverance, Man of God, I have peace.
    <br>I can sleep well; I can reason well.
    <br>Before, I could not reason well.
    <br>I used to hear a voice telling me to go out and do all these kinds of things.
    <br>Now you are delivered.
    <br>What can you say?
    <br>Are you still hearing the voice?
    <br>No, sir.
    <br>Since I received my deliverance, Man of God, I no longer hear that voice.
    <br>I sleep well.
    <br>What advice do you have for the people that are still in that business?
    <br>You say when we go to some streets, we see 'African people',
    <br>half naked and on the street in the night.
    <br>Do you have anything to share with us?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>My advice goes to parents.
    <br>Parents here, please listen to me carefully.
    <br>Your children, they are out there - you are here -
    <br>driving cars, bragging they are a landlady or landlord.
    <br>You need to go and see what they are doing there.
    <br>Many of them, they are there - you think they are living fine but they are not.
    <br>Many of them are dead.
    <br>Your daughters who had travelled to Europe - you are waiting to hear from her
    <br>and you haven't heard from her, she is no longer alive.
    <br>I saw many of them face to face - those are the girls I knew, we worked together -
    <br>all of them are dead.
    <br>Some of them slept with vampires; some of them are no longer alive.
    <br>Please, my advice: You should seek the face of God.
    <br>Stop your children from doing this.
    <br>Man of God, please, if there is anything you can do to help them, they are dying there.
    <br>I know what I'm saying; I am coming from there.
    <br>Can I ask you a question?
    <br>In the process of sleeping with them, there were some stubborn children.
    <br>Though you were using prevention,
    <br>but at the end of the day you would see yourself conceiving.
    <br>You tried to remove it - now way.
    <br>Those children - where are they?
    <br>Man of God, if such thing happened,
    <br>the boss must make sure that that pregnancy was removed.
    <br>Some died through that, while some survived.
    <br>- Are you still having those thoughts?
    <br>- No, Man of God.
    <br>The urge is gone.
    <br>I am free, Man of God.
    <br>- Is that the only child you have?
    <br>- Yes, she is the only one I have
    <br>and she is also free, Man of God.
    <br>She received her deliverance.
    <br>She received her deliverance? 
    <br>- Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Let me hear from her. Your name? How are you?
    <br>I am fine.
    <br>Tell us, as a little girl - 12 years old; how did this come over you?
    <br>How did you start it?
    <br>It started when I was seven years old, when I was living with my dad.
    <br>OK, it's alright. Don't worry. I think parents would not like to hear this.
    <br>- You say you normally hear a voice?
    <br>- Yes, before.
    <br>Then the voice spoke what?
    <br>The voice would tell me that I should go out.
    <br>If I didn't want to go out, the people beside me would be irritating me
    <br>and I wouldn't feel like being close to them, so I would run away.
    <br>- So, you would go out and meet men?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- And they would give you money?
    <br>- Not all of them.
    <br>- Not all men gave you money?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- You just wanted to satisfy yourself?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>- You went to clubs, didn't you?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Now you are delivered.
    <br>What happened.
    <br>I feel happy now.
    <br>I don't hear the voice anymore.
    <br>I am delivered.
    <br>The spiritual husband that I had before is gone.
    <br>Where is your father?
    <br>He is in Abuja; I don't know how he is doing.
    <br>You don't know your father?
    <br>I know him but I don't know where he is living now.
    <br>OK. Let me ask your mum.
    <br>He is in Abuja.
    <br>- Do you still see the father?
    <br>- No, sir.
    <br>For how many years now?
    <br>For seven years; since I travelled to Europe.
    <br>Since I travelled to Europe in 2007, I haven't seen him.
    <br>OK.
    <br>You have built some houses in the village, haven't you?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>The house had been sold because my family were fighting over it.
    <br>Did you meet some preachers, evangelists, preaching among you people,
    <br>trying to tell you people the way out of this?
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>They would come but with the instruction that was given to us by our boss,
    <br>we wouldn't listen to them.
    <br>I think you would be the better instrument.
    <br>I will ask God.
    <br>You will be the better instrument because they know you as one of them,
    <br>I mean, if you are filled with the grace of God.
    <br>And we will support you financially to go back there and preach.
    <br>"I Slept With 50 Men A Night..." - CONFESSIONS OF A PROSTITUTE
    <br>You will make a difference, you will convert many of them.
    <br>You must know what it takes to be poor,
    <br>before you can preach to the poor people.
    <br>Now you know what it is to be in that kind of stupid life.
