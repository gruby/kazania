  <p>    
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>As the Spirit directs. Thank you.
    <br>As the Spirit directs.
    <br>If you like to sit, sit; if you don't like to sit, stand.
    <br>Next time, I will not tell you to do this, to do that - as the Spirit directs.
    <br>When I do that, you may choose to stand on your seat.
    <br>You may decide to raise your leg.
    <br>Our attitude, our behaviour, whatever we do should be according to the Spirit.
    <br>The ministry here is an apostolic ministry.
    <br>Do you know that?
    <br>I believe you have been dancing since morning according to the Spirit.
    <br>You mean, the Spirit asked you to dance like this?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You did that on your own.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Merry Christmas!
    <br>Happy New Year!
    <br>Good - from your heart.
    <br>With all your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Let us look at a message here that will encourage you because Christmas is in the air.
    <br>It is very important we encourage ourselves.
    <br>Let's look at the force because the Bible says only faith pleases God
    <br>but there is a force that sets faith to work.
    <br>If faith is the only... there is a force that sets faith to work.
    <br>Let's look at the Book of 1 Corinthians 13:13.
    <br>"And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.
    <br>But the greatest of these is love."
    <br>That shows that without love, faith cannot work.
    <br>You say only faith pleases God
    <br>but in this text if love is the greatest, this means that without love, faith cannot work.
    <br>Faith cannot work without love.
    <br>This means the force that sets faith to work is love.
    <br>This is faith but for faith to move, it needs love.
    <br>What is love?
    <br>Love looks around to see who is in need,
    <br>who is sick, who is unsaved, who is depressed, who is worried.
    <br>Have you done that?
    <br>Look around to see who is in need of what you possess,
    <br>who is sick, who is unsaved, who is depressed, who is worried.
    <br>You say, "Have faith in God".
    <br>But there is something that sets that faith to work - love.
    <br>When you talk in love and faith, God talks.
    <br>When I move in love and faith, God moves.
    <br>When you pray in love and faith, God prays.
    <br>When you sit in love and faith, God sits.
    <br>"How are you?" - in love and faith.
    <br>Am I a Christian?
    <br>Am I a child of God?
    <br>You measure your life by your love for God.
    <br>I measure my life by my love for God.
    <br>Am I a Christian? You can know if you are a Christian.
    <br>Measure your life by your love for God.
    <br>Love your neighbour as yourself.
    <br>Your neighbour can be those who do not share the same faith with you.
    <br>Your neighbour can be your enemy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Until you begin to do that, there is nothing like a new beginning.
    <br>It is still 'old beginning', nothing like 'new beginning'.
    <br>Evil is rampant, everywhere, in our society today.
    <br>Unfortunately, evil seems to prevail over good
    <br>but when you put love in your life, in your home, in your relationships and all around you,
    <br>you drive out evil.
    <br>When you put love in your life, in your home, in your relationships,
    <br>in your place of work and all around you, you drive out evil.
    <br>Evil cannot stand love.
    <br>If your sisters and your brothers are trying to hurt you, you should pray for love for them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Don't forget: Those of us that normally ask ourselves,
    <br>"I don't know whether I am a Christian or not" -
    <br>you can know if you are a Christian.
    <br>Measure your life by your love for God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Measure your life by your love for God.]
    <br>"Am I a Christian? What is wrong?
    <br>Why is this happening to me? This is nightmare.
    <br>I have done so much: I'm an evangelist, I pay my tithes,
    <br>I go to church regularly - why is all this happening to me?"
    <br>You are worried.
    <br>Measure your life; the Bible says you can know if you are a Christian.
    <br>You can know.
    <br>How do you know? You know by measuring your life by your love for God.
    <br>When I say, "Your love for God" - whatever you do to your fellow, that you do to God.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again, "You can know if you are a Christian.
    <br>Measure your life by your love for God".
    <br>That which you do to your fellow, that you do to God.
    <br>If you know that, you know how to take care of your neighbour.
    <br>You will not give your neighbour what you do not need - the used materials.
    <br>You will give your neighbour what you cherish, what your life depends on.
    <br>If you know that, "Yes, I need to measure my life by my love for God
    <br>and what I do to my neighbour, that I do to God.
    <br>Ok. My love to my neighbour - I will give what I need, what I cherish,
    <br>what my life depends on".
    <br>Not what you do not need, not change.
    <br>You give what your life depends on - it means, what you are using,
    <br>you take it and give it to your friend, this Christmas.
    <br>You can know if you are going to have a new beginning.
    <br>How do we know?
    <br>My love for God. Whatever I do...
    <br>You cannot see God. It is your neighbour.
    <br>Whatever I do to my neighbour, that I do to God.
    <br>Have you been doing that before? Be sincere.
    <br>Sometimes.
    <br>- Sometimes you have God.
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Other time you have satan.
    <br>No, no, no. You cannot live without leader, mentor.
    <br>Sometimes you live for God and other times, you live for satan.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>What is, "Yes, sir"?
    <br>You say, "Sometimes" and it is not possible to live a neutral life.
    <br>It is a neutral life. You say, "No, I'm not going to live for God.
    <br>I'm not going to live for satan" - it is not possible.
    <br>It is either you live for God or you live for satan.
    <br>- You say, "Sometimes".
    <br>- Yes, sir.
    <br>What is "sometimes"?
    <br>Sometimes you will live upright, sometimes you will go wayward.
    <br>Sometimes you live as a Christian, sometimes you just go...
    <br>Did you listen to that?
    <br>Please, the word "sometimes" -
    <br>no, either you live for God or you live for satan.
    <br>What are you taking home now?
    <br>What I am taking home is that:
    <br>I have to put love in my life.
    <br>You confuse the whole thing.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>The life we are now taking home:
    <br>what we do for God, that we do for our neighbour. Ok?
    <br>And we have been talking about what?
    <br>Love.
    <br>Without love, faith cannot work.
    <br>Because the Bible says, love is the greatest.
    <br>If love is the greatest, it means, it is the force that sets faith working.
    <br>And what is love?
    <br>If the Bible says, love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>It does not say, Christian, Muslim or this.
    <br>It says, who is in need.
    <br>There is nothing there that says, Christian or Muslim.
    <br>It says, love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>Who is a Christian or Muslim - there is nothing like that.
    <br>Who is in need?
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>Love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>That 'who is in need' means your neighbour
    <br>and your neighbour can be those who do not share the same faith with you or your enemy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Who has something to answer there?
    <br>Now, Christmas is in the air, right?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>How do you celebrate, how do you go about your Christian life?
    <br>I go about my Christian life by looking for those who are in need,
    <br>irrespective of their religion, their belief.
    <br>Have you been doing that before?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>But the fruit we are seeing now does not show you have been doing that before.
    <br>You are so desperate, you are worried.
    <br>There are many things you are looking for.
    <br>You are looking for a new beginning?
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>That shows, you have not been having a new beginning.
    <br>If you had been living a new beginning, you would not be looking for a new beginning.
    <br>That shows you have not been living an excellent life.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>Have you been living an excellent life?
    <br>I have not been living an excellent life.
    <br>What is the cause?
    <br>And you deserve an excellent life.
    <br>Exactly.
    <br>Can we have anyone that can tell us about the life you have been living before now?
    <br>I have been watching Emmanuel TV back there in Delta where I work.
    <br>I travelled down from Delta and I have been following it.
    <br>Recently, the issue of faith and love has been coming up.
    <br>As a result of that, before I came here, I made sure that
    <br>I went to hospitals and places to deliver things.
    <br>As I am going back, I still have a programme for those who are working in my...
    <br>Why are you doing this? What is the motive?
    <br>The motive behind it is:
    <br>I want to be closer to God now.
    <br>Clap for Jesus.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The motive matters. The manner you give matters.
    <br>You are giving so that you can be given, you can receive plenty - no.
    <br>That is the way of life - the way of a child of God: We want to live to please God.
    <br>Your neighbours, they are 'God'.
    <br>You cannot see God but you can see your neighbour.
    <br>- Can you see God?
    <br>- No.
    <br>- But your neighbour?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Ok, do to them.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Do to them and leave judgement for God.
    <br>Do to them instead of saying, "He is a Muslim - I cannot give.
    <br>I cannot love him. I cannot employ him.
    <br>I cannot favour him - he is a Muslim".
    <br>That is judgement.
    <br>If you now judge, who will judge you on the Last Day?
    <br>If you now turn to judge and you are judging people,
    <br>"He is a Christian, he is a Muslim, he cannot be my friend,
    <br>he cannot be my this, my that",
    <br>who will now judge you on the Last Day?
    <br>We are not given any right to judge.
    <br>Ok. My brother wants to say something.
    <br>I have learnt a lot from this ministry
    <br>and I have been doing what I have learnt from this ministry
    <br>and God has taken glory over my life.
    <br>I visit elderly's homes.
    <br>This time around, I have learnt to give what I use myself.
    <br>Before I came here, I visited the elderly's home, and I tend to do more.
    <br>The motive is that God has been giving me His best and I think He deserves my best.
    <br>Thank you very much for coming out to talk.
    <br>700 million people are watching.
    <br>So you can see how many people you are trying to save their soul,
    <br>to teach them the way of the Lord.
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you very much.
    <br>It is not too late to adjust yourself, to adjust your life.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Don't wait until people call you for help.
    <br>Love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>Whilst you are sitting down since morning in the church,
    <br>if you look around, just look at your back, your right,
    <br>you will find someone, your heart will tell you, "Ah. No, no, no".
    <br>"Excuse me, what can I do for you?" - that settles the matter.
    <br>Your neighbour at home, you live in the same house,
    <br>you see their children playing football in the morning, afternoon.
    <br>Whilst children are going to school, you still see them playing football, always at home.
    <br>You know these children are not going to school
    <br>and you are living in the same compound with them.
    <br>You cannot approach their parents,
    <br>"Come on. Why are your children playing football in the morning, in the afternoon?
    <br>I'm always seeing them around. What can I do to help?
    <br>They need to go to school".
    <br>Their parents will say, "Thank you, sir".
    <br>They will tell you the reason why they are always at home.
    <br>You can help but you see them, you never mind, it is nothing concerning you.
    <br>Love looks around to see who is in need.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Thank you. Let's hear from our pastor.
    <br>I just want to ask a question.
    <br>How can I identify someone that I can help?
    <br>Yes, I know what you are talking about, sir.
    <br>The Holy Spirit leads us.
    <br>In case we don't possess the Holy Spirit, you have to start by yourself.
    <br>Ok, let me give you a good example.
    <br>If a smoker is here today and you smoke a lot,
    <br>but you now look at the whole thing going on and say, "Ah, I will not smoke again",
    <br>but on getting to the opposite there, you have that serious urge.
    <br>"No, no, no."
    <br>Everything big starts little - "no, no, no."
    <br>Ok, let me give you an example.
    <br>When Jesus and Peter were at the sea,
    <br>Jesus was right on the sea and Peter said, "I want to come to You".
    <br>Jesus wants to see his desire, his zeal,
    <br>that he really means what he says.
    <br>Jesus did not show any help at the beginning.
    <br>He said, "Peter, come; if you want to come to Me - ok, I want to see your excitement.
    <br>I want to see your desire that you really want to come to Me before I help you".
    <br>Peter entered the water on his own.
    <br>While he was going, he was sinking
    <br>and in his heart he was saying, "Ah, Jesus has to help me; if not, I will drown".
    <br>But he was sinking.
    <br>Not until he got to the middle of the sea and the water was here,
    <br>Jesus said, "I have seen that you really want to come to Me".
    <br>Jesus stretched His hand to help him
    <br>and the Bible says, Peter floated up and started walking on the sea to Jesus.
    <br>You can also do the same thing today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>At the beginning, you will give it wrongly - continue giving it wrongly,
    <br>those whom you are not supposed to give, you continue to give.
    <br>By the time you give it, the direction God says you should go,
    <br>maybe you just go anyhow because you don't have the Holy Spirit to give that thing.
    <br>You just have to give it, you have the desire to give.
    <br>God says, we should give - we give.
    <br>By the time you get to a certain point, Jesus will now help you to give the right people.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>By then, you would have given it to the wrong people, right people;
    <br>you would even give to people who would give you a call and say,
    <br>"You are a foolish man for giving me what you have given.
    <br>This is sacrifice. You are not serious".
    <br>They will abuse you, a lot of things will happen to you and you continue to give.
    <br>It will get to a certain point Jesus will now see your desire -
    <br>your desire is very strong, you need His help.
    <br>He will now possess you with the Spirit, adopt you.
    <br>By the time He adopts you, you will now see whom to give, the right people to give
    <br>but you have to start on your own.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you, Man of God. God bless you, sir.
    <br>In your case now, you have to start on your own.
    <br>Your genuine willingness first.
    <br>By the time you show that genuine willingness and you are giving,
    <br>all what you have given, the Holy Spirit may not even be involved
    <br>but the desire you need - that is how to attract the Holy Spirit.
    <br>The Bible says, the genuine willingness plus God's ability gives a new birth.
    <br>At the beginning, your genuine willingness  - you continue.
    <br>As time goes on, God will come to your aid.
    <br>Yes, this is what happened to Peter at the sea.
    <br>Very correct, sir. Thank you, sir.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Can you see the question my brother is asking now, helping everyone of us?
    <br>Before now, you never knew.
    <br>I know you are giving on your own now.
    <br>But it will get to a point God Himself will see your desire.
    <br>The same thing - the smoker.
    <br>Stopped smoking.
    <br>At that point you stop, don't expect God to help you to remove the urge.
    <br>After you have stopped, the urge will continue.
    <br>It may even lead you to depression, sickness.
    <br>Because you have stopped and the urge is so serious and you decided not to go on,
    <br>God will now come to your aid to help you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is not at the point - He does as He wills.
    <br>The moment you stop smoking, you stop drinking,
    <br>the urge will increase.
    <br>You will now begin... - as if you are running crazy.
    <br>The urge would be so serious but you insist that, "No, I will not go into it.
    <br>I will not smoke again. I will not drink again".
    <br>By the time you insist and you stop drinking, smoking
    <br>and the urge increases, Jesus will not allow you to die.
    <br>He will look at you, see your desire, "Oh yes, this is a genuine willingness and come to your aid.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And I know this is happening to all of you here - everyone.
    <br>Once you say, "I have stopped smoking" - you stopped smoking
    <br>but to you Christians today, they don't know that at the beginning,
    <br>your genuine willingness is what God wants to see first.
    <br>You do it on your own.
    <br>By the time you are sleeping, they will now give you three packets of cigarettes to smoke.
    <br>You that stopped smoking, by the time you sleep...
    <br>By the time you wake up, you realise, "Ah, I smoked a lot in the night".
    <br>You wake up - there is odour in your mouth.
    <br>You feel it that you smoked - serious urge.
    <br>When you look this side - cigarettes you want to smoke.
    <br>Here - you want to smoke.
    <br>"Oh, and I said, I will not smoke!
    <br>I love Jesus, I will not smoke! I want to follow Jesus!"
    <br>You see people crying at that point.
    <br>You will start crying.
    <br>Even some of your children, your husband at home, your wife will start crying,
    <br>"I have the urge to smoke but I will not smoke".
    <br>Just insist - stop, don't smoke.
    <br>Jesus will come to your aid.
    <br>He wants to see your genuine willingness.
    <br>Take your time; look at the case of Peter.
    <br>At the beginning, when Peter saw Jesus on the sea, he said to Jesus,
    <br>"I want to come to You, Lord".
    <br>Jesus said, "You mean, you want to come to Me?" - three times.
    <br>"You mean, you want to come to Me? Ok, come!"
    <br>The Bible says, He left Peter on his own to use his own mental assent, human ability.
    <br>And Peter entered the water.
    <br>As he entered, he sank,
    <br>not until he got to a certain point that he started drinking the water, he was drowning.
    <br>Jesus realised that this boy was drowning and only his hand was remaining.
    <br>Jesus said, "No, this is a genuine willingness. Come on!"
    <br>He floated on the sea and started coming to Jesus.
    <br>The same thing that is happening to all of us today.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You say, "No, this thing - I will not do it again".
    <br>By the time you stop doing it, you will start having urge,
    <br>you will start saying to yourself, "Where is Jesus now? Why can't Jesus help me?
    <br>This is urge, I cannot help myself" - you go back to it again.
    <br>You vomit - you say, "No, I will not take this vomit"
    <br>- you go back to your vomit again instead of insisting...
    <br>Right now, ask Jesus to open your heart to His Word.
    <br>Open my heart to Your Word!
    <br>Open my heart to Your Spirit!
    <br>Ask Jesus, "Open my heart to Your Spirit!"
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Open my heart to Your Spirit!]
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray!
    <br>Now, this is the journey.
    <br>At the beginning, you are at your own.
    <br>But the Father is somewhere looking at you.
    <br>"Ok, you mean it?
    <br>You will not smoke again? You mean it?
    <br>Ok, you will stop on your own."
    <br>You will pass through some tests, urge, in the night.
    <br>By the time you stand on your own, "I say, I will not go back to it again", He will come to your rescue.
    <br>He wants you to value the relationship.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "He wants me to value the relationship".
    <br>How can you value the relationship when you don't know how much it cost you?
    <br>You will become my friend now - you know what it cost you to be my friend.
    <br>You have been flying from New York ten times, five times.
    <br>You never saw TB Joshua but suddenly after eight times, you will find me.
    <br>"TB Joshua, I have been looking for you. It is ten times now that I have been coming."
    <br>If suddenly you say, "I will not smoke again" and suddenly the urge disappears,
    <br>everything disappears, you will get stronger - the moment you said it -
    <br>you may likely not value the relationship
    <br>and you may likely not maintain the relationship.
