    <br>Thank you all.
    <br>Viewers, thank you. We will appreciate your love, care and prayer for the families.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Let us see the message for today.
    <br>I want to take you to the Book of John 14:6.
    <br>"Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life.
    <br>No one comes to the Father except through me.
    <br>If you really know me, you will know my Father...' "
    <br>Listen to that - "No one comes to the Father except through me.
    <br>If you really know the Father, you will know me."
    <br>This is the message from Jesus.
    <br>A Christian does not consider death to be his end but the end of his trouble, tribulation.
    <br>Whether you die young or old, no matter the nature of death,
    <br>death is sure to come.
    <br>What matters is the grace to continue living hereafter.
    <br>Viewers, what matters is the grace to continue living hereafter.
    <br>We need to be sure that we are ready to depart.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Will you be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>I will be ready
    <br>When the Lord shall come
    <br>Will you be ready?
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>Continue to trust in God; it's the only way to get ready for the things we are not ready for.
    <br>Trust and obey
    <br>There is no other way
    <br>To be happy in Jesus
    <br>Trust and obey
    <br>Continue to trust in the Lord; it's the only way to get ready for the things we are not ready for.
    <br>The question you need to ask yourself: Are you living each day as if it were your last?
    <br>That is the question.
    <br>Are you living each day as if it were your last?
    <br>How are you using your life?
    <br>I mean, how are you spending your life?
    <br>Because the greatest way to use life is to spend it on something that will outlive it.
    <br>For instance, to love someone more dearly every day.
    <br>When you look around you, you will see someone who is in need of your love,
    <br>you will see someone who is in need of your help,
    <br>you will see someone who is in need of your strength,
    <br>you will see someone who is in need of your time to help a wandering child find his way -
    <br>I mean, to help widows, widowers, orphans, the less-privileged and unsaved
    <br>to follow truth - John 14:6, as blind men long for light.
    <br>To keep our heart fit for His holy sight and answer when He calls - this is our task.
    <br>Let me leave you with a million words: Live each day as if it were your last.
    <br>Someday, you will be right.
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you for your time.
    <br>September 12 will be the fifth anniversary of our great heroes of faith - the martyrs.
    <br>As usual, we will appreciate your love, care, support and prayers for their families.
    <br>Thank you all.
