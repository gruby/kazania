    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua's Arrival
    <br>In The Nation Of Paraguay
    <br>One of the top prestigious newspapers in Paraguay, on Thursday, the 10th of August 2017
    <br>featured Prophet T.B. Joshua in their article titled,
    <br>"Nigerian Preacher, TB Joshua, Awarded Paraguay's Highest Honour – The National Order Of Merit".
    <br>The national Parliament of Paraguay has concurred to grant the "Comuneros" National Order of Merit
    <br>to Nigerian Prophet TB Joshua.
    <br>This was decided August 9th 2017, at the sitting of the parliament in Asuncion,
    <br>according to 970 AM Radio journalist, Nativida Romero.
    <br>Member of Parliament Bernardo Villalba (ANR) proposed
    <br>that the spiritual leader, Temitope Balogun Joshua, receive the highest distinction
    <br>the Parliament can bestow.
    <br>The legislator's proposal was fully approved.
    <br>Avanze Pais MP, Rocio Casco, did however oppose it on the ground that the distinction had previously
    <br>only been awarded to citizens of the country.
    <br>For his part, the legislator Villalba maintained his position.
    <br>Villalba put forward his arguments, in full session, where he expressed that Joshua,
    <br>compelled to visit Paraguay, "will bring peace and blessing to the population".
    <br>"I do not just want to welcome him to our country.
    <br>We pray that his stay be as fruitful as possible
    <br>and that it will be a blessing to our nation.
    <br>For the first time ever, I propose the National Order to be awarded to a personality and I am proposing that
    <br>he be awarded this distinction by the Members of Parliament," said Villalba.
    <br>Villalba solicited that the preacher be presented the national honour at the Defensores del Chaco Stadium,
    <br>where he will host the crusade.
