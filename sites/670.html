    <br>Yes, listen to the Word of God.
    <br>Let the weak say, "I am strong!"
    <br>Let the sick say, "I am healed!"
    <br>Let the poor say, "I am blessed!"
    <br>Right now, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Word of God will continue to command every spirit;
    <br>that spirit that is not of God, their mission is to kill, destroy and steal.

    <br>I'm talking to that familiar spirit - where can you go from His presence?
    <br>You familiar spirit, where can you go from His presence?
    <br>You familiar spirit, where can you go from God's presence?
