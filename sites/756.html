    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Viewers all over the world, thank you for your time.
    <br>TALK ON FAITH
    <br>The reality of faith can only be proved by practice.
    <br>The reality of faith can only be proved by what?
    <br>[By practice.]
    <br>If you say you have faith, you should not just only believe in Him.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If you say you have faith, you should not just only believe in Him".
    <br>If somebody says, "I believe God", where is your faith?
    <br>You say, "I believe God, I am a Christian". 
    <br>Where is your faith?
    <br>Faith must be practised.
    <br>We should not merely talk about faith; we should put it into practice because faith is a conviction.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>Our works prove our faith.
    <br>Your work proves your faith.
    <br>Are you doing "419", you know how to play people to gain or to deceive people?
    <br>Your work proves your faith.
    <br>Your work perfects or completes your faith.
    <br>It means if you don’t have good works, you don’t have faith.
    <br>Only faith pleases God.
    <br>Nothing.
    <br>Our works prove our faith.
    <br>Our works perfect or complete our faith.
    <br>Let me start from African countries.
    <br>Sometimes, when I see what is happening around the world, I keep quiet.
    <br>Even the revelation for the year - I refuse to release it.
    <br>I decided to do that.
    <br>I think that position is better.
    <br>That position is better to pray for the whole world.
    <br>The Bible says where there is no vision, people perish.
    <br>What has happened to my people in DRC - Congo.
    <br>I think it was three years ago when I was invited to that country, to see the president.
    <br>I prayed.
    <br>I said - to travel to DRC to see the president, the Head of State...
    <br>I went through the letter and said, "OK, I must go".
    <br>I prayed over it.
    <br>God said that He would give me a message to deliver.
    <br>"If you say you are going, do you have a message to deliver now?"
    <br>I said, "No".
    <br>"So, you have to wait for the message."
    <br>I said, "OK".
    <br>It is true - I am not going there to pray.
    <br>I should go there to deliver a message.
    <br>If I say that I will travel there because I am a man of God and I am going to pray...
    <br>After a prayer, there must be a revelation but for now - no revelation.
    <br>That was three years ago.
    <br>I said, "OK".
    <br>I then decided to send my team.
    <br>I raised a team of three, four, five from different countries to visit the nation and the president.
    <br>I asked them to greet the president.
    <br>I was not trying to be proud.
    <br>Who I am - I am just a human being but as a man of God, I must have a revelation before I move.
    <br>I just wanted to honour the invitation because I was not able to go there.
    <br>OK, my people went there - good.
    <br>They received them joyfully as visitors to the Head of State.
    <br>They delivered my message and came back.
    <br>The delegation from this country also came here with joy to visit us - OK.
    <br>I said, "Before God will release me to come to your country, this is the message:
    <br>By February, there will be trouble".
    <br>That was three years ago.
    <br>I said the trouble would start from February and I stated those troubles that would start,
    <br>which they took home and delivered to the nation.
    <br>The reason I am saying this is that
    <br>I am worried; I am not comfortable because of what is happening around the world.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This will happen; that will happen, by February.
    <br>The whole thing will start unfolding and there will be a crisis.
    <br>Let's start our prayer from the country.
    <br>Rise up and let us pray for the nation because the crisis is coming.
    <br>I want you to do it with all your heart.
    <br>Don't say it is not your country - any country is your country.
    <br>Open your heart and pray for God's intervention in the nation, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
    <br>Prayer For God's Intervention In The Nation Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
    <br>God's intervention – because I am seeing trouble coming – big trouble.
    <br>God's intervention.
    <br>Prayer For God's Intervention In The Nation Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
    <br>God's intervention in the nation, Congo - DRC.
    <br>Prayer For God's Intervention In The Nation Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>I am saying this because with what is happening now,
    <br>what I saw in the vision today again, my heart is bleeding.
    <br>I know, with God, all things are possible.
    <br>God will redeem the nation and citizens in Jesus' name.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>You will join me to pray for many countries today.
    <br>Let's now go to Southern Africa.
    <br>I am seeing some natural disasters like wind – bad wind coming from the sea -
    <br>bad nature – natural disasters that will destroy many things, that will move from one country to another.
    <br>I saw this – that was the last two years.
    <br>We keep praying but there is a momentum in the sea which will look strange,
    <br>which has never happened in Africa.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The whole thing will arrange from the Mozambique area.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Poor people live in environments where all these things will happen -
    <br>people who will not have a place to go; they will become refugees.
    <br>Poor people who are looking for shelter to stay -
    <br>they are the ones living in ninety percent of the environment I am talking about.
    <br>This thing will move from country to country.
    <br>I don't want to mention any county.
    <br>Let us rise up and pray for part of Southern Africa -
    <br>moving from countries like Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana and some areas there.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Why am I calling for your attention to this?
    <br>I have been praying.
    <br>God said, "Call the attention of your people".
    <br>Let's pray together because of the Hosts of Heaven, the atmosphere we are in.
    <br>Whatever we loose shall be loosed, whatever we bind shall be bound.
    <br>Open your lips for prayer.
    <br>Prayer For God's Intervention In Countries of Southern Africa
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Let there be calmness!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Wherever this nature – tragedy in the sea, air, rainy season, dry season -
    <br>this bad nature that is coming – let there be calmness, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Jesus said to the sea and wind, "Be calm!"
    <br>Let there be calmness, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>What Africa depends on at this time is farming and it will greatly affect the farmers,
    <br>cattle rearers – all these will be affected, greatly.
    <br>Let there be calmness, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>As you are praying, add Ethiopia as a nation.
    <br>Remember the nation Ethiopia in prayer.
    <br>Pray against famine – serious one.
    <br>What is the cause of this? Because of season – unpredictable.
    <br>Open your lips and pray for the country Ethiopia.
    <br>Prayer For God's Intervention In The Country Ethiopia
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Open your lips and pray with me: You, wind, we say, be calm!
    <br>Let there be calmness, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You, wind, you, disaster of any kind – be calm, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>We cannot let this thing to disturb us - they will have to go back the way they came.
    <br>We say, calmness, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Anytime you pray, please remember this country.
    <br>It is not that other countries don't have their own challenges but I'm seeing this natural disaster.
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Now, back to my nation, Nigeria.
    <br>The last two years, there was a vision, a prophecy for the nation, which is still going on.
    <br>It's not only for last year but still for this year.
    <br>It is still going on 'til June.
    <br>This is why God said, "Hold on. What you said two years ago that there will be scarcity of food
    <br>and devaluation of money and we are in the valley – that was two years ago -
    <br>and our future is crying for help, will end this coming June".
    <br>We are in February now.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>By the time we leave June, we know all those prophecies I said about food scarcity, devaluation of money...
    <br>Because this money will still continue going up and it will seem to rest when it is getting to 650.
    <br>It will seem to begin to rest; it will not be able to go forward.
    <br>It will not be able to go forward because that will be the peak.
    <br>The battle of going up, down, up, down will continue but when it gets to that,
    <br>it will not be able to go up again; rather, it will want to go down, if the system permits -
    <br>if the system agrees with divine will.
    <br>I was saying something which you didn't take note of and I want to repeat that.
    <br>Your president has good intentions.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Good intentions cannot be carried out alone without good followers.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you heard what I said - it is OK.
    <br>But even Mr. T.B. Joshua may have heard what Prophet T.B. Joshua was saying as a human being.
    <br>Two persons are standing here.
    <br>Mr. T.B. Joshua may hate Prophet for what he is saying.
    <br>If Mr. hates the Prophet - if you hate me, there is nothing bad about that.
    <br>I repeat again.
    <br>Your president has good intentions but good intentions cannot be carried out alone without good followers.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>The priority of every Nigerian citizen now is the good health of your president.
    <br>It can be anyone’s turn tomorrow.
    <br>What you wish for others, God makes happen to you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What you wish for others, God makes happen to you.
    <br>We rise up together and pray – with all your heart.
    <br>I want us to rise up – with all your heart.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask God to give him whatever he needs.
    <br>Because you have not heard anything, whatever you believe he needs
    <br>for the strength and enablement to rule successfully, the Lord should give him. Prayer.
    <br>Prayer For The Nigerian President
    <br>Strength where there is weakness – enablement, in Jesus Christ’s name.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Thank you for the prayer.
    <br>More importantly, we have to rise up that the Lord should give the grace to sustain democracy.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Rise up for prayer.
    <br>Grace for democratic sustainability. Prayer.
    <br>Prayer Of Grace For Democratic Sustainability
    <br>Pray for uninterrupted democracy.
    <br>Prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In Jesus Christ’s name we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>No nation is ruled successfully without good institutions.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Africa as a whole - we only look for leaders, we don't look for institutions.
    <br>We don't mind about institutions, we are looking for leaders.
    <br>Leaders cannot rule alone, without good institutions.
    <br>The whole Africa lacks institutions.
    <br>They have leaders but leaders cannot do it alone.
    <br>It is like a prophet without disciples.
    <br>It is not a "one day job" for a prophet to have disciples.
    <br>This is why everywhere in Africa they want to run for power two times.
    <br>Their first time seems to be rubbish because they use strangers to work with them.
    <br>By the second time they would have studied those who can work with them and do good.
    <br>Every African leader does better the second time because they didn't have good disciples
    <br>to work with them during the "first time".
    <br>People working with leaders during the "first time" are donors -
    <br>they support them, give leaders money, pray for them
    <br>but they are not real disciples - they just give help, financial and moral support.
    <br>By the time the leader becomes a president, he calls his supporters to give them positions.
    <br>But the leaders don't really know them by their character.
    <br>They receive positions just because they helped.
    <br>So, the "first time" is always nonsense in every African country
    <br>because they seem to use strangers to work with them.
    <br>In the "second time", they would have studied people and know, "Oh, really! This is my disciple"
    <br>and put them into positions. They do better during their "second time".
    <br>I'm not studying government - I'm just telling you the mind of God.
    <br>If any leader comes to the office for the first time and says that he would do everything,
    <br>he would do this, he would do that,
    <br>I just look - "Can you do it alone?"
    <br>You are coming for the first time - for how long have you known the people working with you?
    <br>Do you know them by their relationships and character?
    <br>How do you know that these people will be loyal to you?
    <br>Just because they helped you...
    <br>If you give money to someone, it does not mean that he is your friend.
    <br>You can give money to your enemy.
    <br>You can even help your enemy.
    <br>It does not mean that he is a man of your own heart.
    <br>That you give millions, trillions to someone does not mean that he is your friend.
    <br>It does not mean that he is a man of your own heart.
    <br>Those are the challenges African countries are facing today.
    <br>When Africa begins to think about institutions...
    <br>There should be a school or university for leaders to go to before they can become this or that.
    <br>So, anyone who becomes a president of a nation must have his disciples as well to join him to rule.
    <br>If not, whatever he promises will fail.
    <br>This is why the "second time" of any leader in Africa seems to do better.
    <br>By the "second time", they would have chosen better people they can work with.
    <br>They will look for men of their own heart.
    <br>This is what is happening all over Africa.
    <br>Now, the same thing is going on all over the world.
    <br>Not only in Africa but all over the world.
    <br>People don't look for a man of their own heart to work with them;
    <br>they just call people because they donate millions to support them.
    <br>They support them in their campaigns.
    <br>They work harder.
    <br>They call them to their cabinet to work - it does not mean that this man can be a man of your own heart.
    <br>You may be seated. Thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Take note of these words I said just now.
    <br>Leaders seem to use men who are not of their own heart.
    <br>To have a man of your own heart is not a day's job; it's a matter of time and preparation.
    <br>To be a minister of this or that...
    <br>To be a chairman of this or that...
    <br>... and you being the head, and he will be loyal to you.
    <br>Your vision will be his vision - it is not easy - it takes time and preparation.
    <br>Jesus knew he would not be able to succeed alone; that is why He had 12 disciples.
    <br>He knew no one can go it alone.
    <br>He knew that as a Saviour he had to look for people to follow Him.
    <br>Even among them - you know what happened.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You know what is happening all over the world - not only in politics; even in the house of God.
    <br>The cause of churches collapsing is what I am talking about now.
    <br>They cannot point to a man of their own heart to do this for them and they cannot do it alone.
    <br>Instead, they use their enemies to do this and their enemies crumble their vision.
    <br>You know what is happening to your business; you cannot do it alone.
    <br>At a time, you wanted to expand but no one was there to help you.
    <br>You cannot be in two places at the same time.
    <br>You continue to expand where you are.
    <br>When you begin to be too popular in a certain place, attack and persecution start.
    <br>This is why today you see millionaires who were up there crumble
    <br>because they could not find people to carry out their vision.
    <br>Branches of their companies – the people that represented those branches crumbled their vision.
    <br>When you start to think about expanding - "No, let me remain where I am".
    <br>Success does not permit that; success wants to explode.
    <br>You can’t light a candle and put it under the roof.
    <br>You must bring the candle out and let the world see it.
    <br>If you put a candle under the roof, it will burn the house.
    <br>If you say you are afraid and you camp that success, you will explode with the success.
    <br>The success will consume you.
    <br>So, now, what is the way out?
    <br>Faith is something that comes spontaneously, naturally – that is faith.
    <br>What is the way out?
    <br>The way out is . as you are growing, take time to train people and impart to people.
    <br>If not, by the time you finish growing and become an iroko tree,
    <br>you will not see anyone to help you; you will use your enemy as a helper.
    <br>Jesus took time to train people, to impart in them.
    <br>And even then - He was betrayed.
    <br>But at last, He made the best out of His people.
    <br>Take your time to train people.
    <br>What do I mean by training?
    <br>Allow them to see what you are doing.
    <br>Let them see what you are doing, so they can do the same.
    <br>As they see what you are doing, your enemies among them will give way
    <br>and those men after your own heart will continue to follow you.
    <br>Finally when you get there, they can be there to carry the vision.
    <br>This is what the world is facing today; there is crisis in this world.
    <br>That is why there are no new things coming.
    <br>I told you last time that we are running out of ideas.
    <br>The world is running out of ideas.
    <br>There is no new vision - nothing new.
    <br>Science is running out of ideas.
    <br>There is no new idea because they are dying with their own ideas.
    <br>They cannot impart those ideas to people.
    <br>They don't have people of their own heart to work with them.
    <br>If you continue to carry it alone, you will get tired.
    <br>If this body is tired, you cannot carry out the vision again.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So, like I have said; as you are growing, take your time to grow others.
    <br>It's not just to be using them and then giving them money.
    <br>We are not talking about money.
    <br>You have people working with you - you can pay them a lot of money - that is not the issue.
    <br>Money cannot make the vision we are talking about; it's all about sincerity.
    <br>You say, "I pay them. I give them huge money. They work with me..."
    <br>We are not talking of working with you and giving them money.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>OK, if you are bigger than this tomorrow, how will you maintain that grace?
    <br>You alone cannot maintain that position; you need someone to…
    <br>And you don’t have any men of your own heart;
    <br>you finally find yourself using your enemy to maintain your vision.
    <br>Look at universities all over the world or in Nigeria... just university in Nigeria alone.
    <br>Do you know what is happening?
    <br>Those best universities in the world that we know about in Nigeria.
    <br>When you go to their premises or campus, see what is happening...
    <br>It is not an issue of money.
    <br>But we keep shouting, "Money! There is no money to develop".
    <br>It is not an issue of money!
    <br>I know money is very important.
    <br>It is not an issue of money.
    <br>If you look at first class students - very brilliant - and you send them to another country for a program
    <br>and another country sends their first class students to that country...
    <br>When they come back, they will raise the standard here.
    <br>How much does it take to send people to...
    <br>And you keep saying, "Money money money".
    <br>If there is money and no brain, can money work?
    <br>Brain is dying - we are running out of ideas.
    <br>You talk of money.
    <br>When there is no idea, money is dead; money is useless.
    <br>If a man without an idea has money - it is like "mental people" having money - the crazy man.
    <br>It is like a very rich man suddenly having a mental problem - it is equal to a rich man running out of ideas.
    <br>When you don't have ideas, the money is useless.
    <br>It is an idea that makes use of money; it is an idea that spends money.
    <br>Where are we going?
    <br>That is our education.
    <br>Not only in Nigeria - all over the world - just like that.
    <br>There are some faculties at universities which need to be increased in number.
    <br>But because you are looking for money, you just want to have a university
    <br>and you don't mind any course they study. You need money from students.
    <br>Whereas there are some important faculties that can build the nation.
    <br>Until we begin to separate those faculties...
    <br>You have this university, college of medicine; you have this university, law school...
    <br>No. You bring all together which destroys university.
    <br>There are some students there that "have no brain" - they just go to university to study any course.
    <br>Compare it to a subject where you have to have a brain to study it.
    <br>You must separate these students in order to build the nation.
    <br>But the university of this or college...
    <br>When you look at those faculties, they seem to be useless.
    <br>These are the faculties that you only spend money on.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When you look at the nation, you will be able to know what the nation needs at that time.
    <br>What does this nation, your country, need at this time?
    <br>Not until we begin to sort out those faculties, universities - separate them, put them where they belong.
    <br>The importance of those faculties...
    <br>Know how you can get the money to raise the standard of those faculties to build the nation.
    <br>When you build those faculties, you are building the nation.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Many parents don't know their right and left.
    <br>They just want their children to go to university.
    <br>Fine.
    <br>We get money but money without ideas is useless.
    <br>So, I think - what we are facing today is that we lack ideas.
    <br>People lack ideas but have money.
    <br>You can't eat your money.
    <br>Your money is not valuable without ideas.
    <br>When you ask people a simple question today, they will complain about their government.
    <br>Our government doesn't do this or that.
    <br>When you don't run out of ideas, you do not have any business with the government -
    <br>even the government will want you to help the nation if you have not run out of ideas.
    <br>It is when we run out of ideas that we begin to complain about the government.
    <br>No money to do this or that - because we are running out of ideas.
    <br>You can be so great without the government.
    <br>The government will now turn to you for help.
    <br>There is a lot of burden on the government because everybody depends on the government.
    <br>That is why the world is collapsing.
    <br>You depend on the government of your nation to live, which is wrong.
    <br>Because we are running out of ideas.
    <br>Without a contract from the government, you cannot live.
    <br>Without government supporting business, you cannot live.
    <br>If there is no budget to give money to everybody, you complain.
    <br>This is what we depend on because we are running out of ideas.
    <br>Not until people have ideas, you cannot leave this pitiful life.
    <br>When trouble comes to the government, it will affect you.
    <br>You have to look beyond.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Rise up for prayer.

    <br>What is the cause of man running out of ideas?
    <br>When you run out of ideas, you begin to look at others to reason and think,
    <br>compare yourself to others and measure yourself with others, you are running out of ideas.
    <br>You say, "This man is slim - I want to be slim. Look at the hair of this woman - I want the same haircut.
    <br>I saw a posh car last week - I want to buy the same car".
    <br>You are running out of ideas.
    <br>You begin to imitate others to live, talk and even pray.
    <br>You look at what people say - you want to say the same because you run out of ideas.
    <br>When you run out of ideas, your money is not your money;
    <br>your money is someone else's money.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>When you run out of ideas, your possession is not your possession;
    <br>it is someone else's possession because you don’t know the use of it.
    <br>Someone else will be using your possessions, enjoying what you have.
    <br>You go for a medical check-up - little time - sickness, disease, this, that...
    <br>They give you this; they give you chieftaincy.
    <br>When there is no money, you are not given the chieftaincy. When money comes, they call you for chieftaincies.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Time to ask yourself, "Why did they not call me for chieftaincy when I didn't have money?
    <br>But now I have money and they call me for chieftaincy".
    <br>You should know that something is wrong somewhere.
    <br>"I was not sick when I did not have enough.
    <br>But now that I have enough, I'm sick."
    <br>What do you think happened then?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"People call me to invite me, to visit them, to come to a party, from all over the world, because I have...
    <br>How do they know that I have?
    <br>When I didn't have, nobody invited me, nobody wanted to be my friend."
    <br>Can't you ask yourself, "Why?"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>So much responsibility - and this responsibility will take you away from God.
    <br>Take note of this once again.
    <br>When you run out of ideas, your possession is someone else's possession.
    <br>To run out of ideas means when you cannot think right at the right time or do things at the right time.
    <br>You may do them but not at the right time.
    <br>You move - it is right that you must move but it is at the wrong time.
    <br>To do things at the right time gives result.
    <br>There is a time for everything.
    <br>If you are not standing up for prayer now at the right time, it means God will not connect with us.
    <br>You pray at the wrong time.
    <br>It's right you are praying but are you praying at the right time?
    <br>The Holy Spirit intercedes for us; we don’t know how to pray.
    <br>You cannot just stand up and just say, "I want to pray".
    <br>If I have faith in God, there will be what?
    <br>There will be work that corresponds with the faith.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith".
    <br>Again.
    <br>If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.
    <br>If there is no work that corresponds with the faith...
    <br>If work is different from faith - that is, you have bad work.
    <br>The work you are doing is not good.
    <br>But you have faith - that cannot correspond.
    <br>If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.
    <br>It is like a magnet and a nail.
    <br>You have a nail here and you have a magnet here - if you bring them close, they will...
    <br>You can see - magnet.
    <br>But if it is not a nail, it will not...
    <br>If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.
    <br>If not, you will continue to say, "I am a Christian. I have faith" but this work doesn't correspond with...
    <br>This is why when we pray today, our prayer goes nowhere.
    <br>We talk to ourselves when we are praying.
    <br>"In the name of Jesus" - you are talking to yourself.
    <br>Tell your neighbour again:
    <br>"If there is faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith."
    <br>This is what I mean by our work proves our faith.
    <br>This is what I mean by our work completes or perfects our faith.
    <br>If your work does not correspond with your faith, you are faithless.
    <br>The faith you are talking about is not faith in God.
    <br>There are all kinds of faith but I am talking about faith in God.
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>Again.
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>Again.
    <br>Have faith in God
    <br>All things are possible
    <br>That is the faith I'm talking about.
    <br>Have it in God - the Bible talks about it in Mark.
    <br>If there is faith - if you claim you have this faith, there will be work that corresponds with the faith.
    <br>You know where your problem comes from now.
    <br>You can know where your problem comes from.
    <br>Right now, it's a matter of talking with all your heart, confessing with all your heart.
    <br>Ask God for His grace; you need His grace.
    <br>Open your lips - prayer.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask God for His grace.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray.
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Out of the message I gave you today, take note of one point.
    <br>This is the mistake we are doing.
    <br>You never believed that your enemy can give you trillions of dollars and yet be your enemy.
    <br>You believed that someone giving you a billion dollars loves you with all his heart.
    <br>Your enemy can give you trillions of dollars and yet be your enemy.
    <br>But you don't know that.
    <br>To you; you consider someone giving you so much a man of your own heart - no, my brother!
    <br>How do you run your business then?
    <br>You run it without ideas because you need money.
    <br>Somebody giving you money becomes your dear friend.
    <br>We don't go beyond to ask God, "Who is giving me money?"
    <br>Do you know that your enemy can establish you?
    <br>If you know that raise up your hand.
    <br>An enemy can establish you for reasons known to him.
    <br>Oh my God.
    <br>There are many things that you don't know.
    <br>You don't know because you are a business man.
    <br>You are a politician.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>This is the reason why you are facing many things.
    <br>Think about your track record from the beginning.
    <br>Sit down and think about your life.
    <br>You will begin to agree with me.
    <br>You don't believe that people that have done so much for you can turn round to be your enemies.
    <br>They seem to be giving you so much, they seem to establish you - they later turn to be your enemies
    <br>at a difficult time, at the time you need them.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I don't want you to get to Heaven before you understand all this.
    <br>I don't want you to go to Heaven before you see the file.
    <br>"I didn't know that this thing is happening in this world and I was there for many years - see me."
    <br>I don't want you to get to Heaven before you understand this; you better understand it now.
