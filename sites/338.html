    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Jesus loves Colombia!
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Never you mind about your time;
    <br>God's time is the best.
    <br>I have no time of my own.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Faith grows as we continue hearing and obeying God's Word.
    <br>Only faith pleases God, nothing else.
    <br>We have to understand this
    <br>and at the same time, we must also understand that faith is not a natural thing.
    <br>It's not a natural issue;
    <br>it's a spiritual force
    <br>that grows and develops within man's heart
    <br>or the spirit of man.
    <br>That is faith for you.
    <br>We shall talk a little about this.
    <br>Faith, as it is written in the Book of Mark,
    <br>when you take your reading from chapter 11 verse 1 to the end,
    <br>is not a natural thing.
    <br>It is a spiritual force;
    <br>it is of man's recreated spirit,
    <br>not man's mind, not of man's flesh.
    <br>It is not a mental assent;
    <br>that is, it is not imitation.
    <br>It is not a legalistic formula.
    <br>Faith does not agree with formula but agrees with God.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>It is not intellectual agreement.
    <br>You can't copy it.
    <br>The way you were healed, I cannot be expected to be healed the same way.
    <br>That is faith for you; it is not imitation.
    <br>I want to take you to the Book of Mark.
    <br>That will form the basis of our reading today.
    <br>THE PRICE OF FAITH - Part 2
    <br>Book of Mark 11:1,
    <br>and the proof text will be verse 22.
    <br>Let's read.
    <br>"As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany
    <br>at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
    <br>saying to them, 'Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it,
    <br>you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden.' "
    <br>Let's go to the verse 22; this is our proof text today.
    <br>" 'Have faith in God,' Jesus answered.
    <br>'I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain,
    <br>'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart..."
    <br>Take note of the word, "in his heart".
    <br>This shows faith is of man's heart.
    <br>It does not say, 'If he does not doubt in his mind'
    <br>or, 'If he does not doubt in his body'.
    <br>No, 'If he does not doubt in his heart'.
    <br>Faith is of man's heart.
    <br>"...but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.
    <br>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer,
    <br>believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.' "
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank you.

    <br>We must understand faith in God,
    <br>faith from God
    <br>and faith of God.
    <br>Take note - faith in God, faith from God and faith of God.
    <br>We must understand that God is Spirit
    <br>as it is written in the Book of John 4:24.
    <br>Faith in Him must be a spiritual thing;
    <br>it is not an intellectual agreement, that is, a formula or reasoning.
    <br>Faith is not a mental assent.
    <br>That is, you want to have faith and you begin to memorise the Bible,
    <br>you commit the Word to memory.
    <br>Committing the Word to memory is a good thing
    <br>but when we talk of faith,
    <br>the Word must be an integral part of our being.
    <br>It is not only committing the Word to memory, which is valuable
    <br>but becoming an integral part of our being - that is faith.
    <br>Let us come down and ask ourselves a very simple question:
    <br>How do we get faith?
    <br>The best way to get faith is to hear the Word of God.
    <br>We should not only hear the Word of God with our ears but we should also hear it with our hearts.
    <br>How can we get the Word of God in our hearts?
    <br>By openness and hunger for God's Word.
    <br>When I say, openness,
    <br>I mean readiness to grab the Word
    <br>as if your life depends on doing that.
    <br>To do this, we must read the Bible with devotion,
    <br>with our quality time, not the time we are tired,
    <br>not the time we do not need
    <br>but use your quality time to read the Bible.
    <br>Not when you are tired.
    <br>When your life depends on knowing or doing something,
    <br>you give the best of your time, your strength and your all to that thing.
    <br>That is the Bible for you -
    <br>your quality time, your best time,
    <br>not the time you do not need,
    <br>not the time you are tired
    <br>because our life depends on knowing it.
    <br>To get the Word into our hearts requires openness and hunger for God's Word.
    <br>That is how to get faith.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Yes.
    <br>We are still talking about the heart, to get the Word into our hearts.
    <br>If the Word must enter your heart...
    <br>Let's go to the Book of Romans 10:9-10.
    <br>The Book of Romans 10:9-10 talks about the heart and the mouth - confession.
    <br>But we are talking of heart now.
    <br>The Book of Romans 10:9-10 talks about belief in our heart.
    <br>Our spirit acts upon the Word.
    <br>It is when this Word comes into our heart that the Spirit acts.
    <br>Again.
    <br>It is when this Word comes into our heart that the Spirit acts.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>When the Spirit acts with the Word, it renews our strength.
    <br>When the Spirit acts with this Word, it renews our strength.
    <br>For the Spirit to act with the Word,
    <br>not only must you commit the Word to memory, which is valuable
    <br>but it is letting the Word become an integral part of our being.
    <br>Christ makes us a part of Himself
    <br>when the Word dominates, rules and sanctifies our spirit natures.
    <br>That is Christ.
    <br>He wants us to be part of Him.
    <br>It is not possible to build one up spiritually on philosophies
    <br>or on the history of this Book.
    <br>You cannot build one up spiritually on the history of this Book
    <br>or theories about the Book; it is not possible.
    <br>We are only made spiritual by living in the Word and by the Word living in us.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>For anyone to talk, to preach, to teach about the two in separation,
    <br>it is biblically incorrect.
    <br>When I am talking to you without being carried along by the Spirit,
    <br>I am entertaining you.
    <br>If I am here now talking to you without being carried along by the Spirit,
    <br>I am entertaining you
    <br>and we are not here for entertainment.
    <br>Are you?
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>For anyone to talk, to preach, to teach about the two in separation,
    <br>it is biblically incorrect, a dangerous mission.
    <br>These are the challenges we are having today in the church.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>The union between the Word and the Spirit makes the Holy Bible.
    <br>There is a Bible and there is the Holy Bible.
    <br>The Bible is the history of the apostles and God's generals.
    <br>Anyone can buy that Bible.
    <br>When you go to the market or the bookshop, they will not ask you,
    <br>"Are you a Christian?"
    <br>They want money; they will tell you the price,
    <br>you will pay for it and they will give you a Bible.
    <br>They have not given you the Holy Bible but a Bible.
    <br>The Holy Bible is the union between the Word and the Spirit,
    <br>which is not for sale.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Everyone has a Bible but not everyone has the Holy Bible.
    <br>How many of us have a Bible here?
    <br>How many of us have the Holy Bible?
    <br>The future of the church - we cannot continue like this
    <br>because we are making Jesus Christ unpopular.
    <br>Ninety-nine percent of the richest kings, queens, presidents and heroes
    <br>are religious people; you will hardly see one that is a Christian
    <br>because we are making Jesus Christ unpopular.
    <br>Jesus is the Word and the Spirit
    <br>but today, we have taken Jesus as the Word.
    <br>There is no way you can get along with Him,
    <br>you cannot stand for Him, you cannot confess Him in truth,
    <br>you cannot defend Him in the presence of unbelievers.
    <br>Instead of talking harmony between the Word and the Spirit, we talk the Word.
    <br>The future of the church depends on our learning from each other.
    <br>That is the future of the church.
    <br>The future of the church depends on our learning from each other.
    <br>I need you; you need me.
    <br>I need your theology; you need my power.
    <br>I need your power; you need my theology.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Because there is no union between the Word and the Spirit,
    <br>this church is known for preaching and teaching the Word of God.
    <br>The other church here is known for miracles, signs and wonders.
    <br>This is not how it should be.
    <br>When you look at the Book of Luke 24:19,
    <br>the early church stood strong in the doctrine and power of God.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>The early church stood strong in the doctrine and power of God.
    <br>That is, they stood strong in the Word and in the Spirit.
    <br>That is the early church.
    <br>The same should happen today
    <br>because Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>The same should happen because
    <br>Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.
    <br>Because this church is known for the teaching of the Word
    <br>and the other church is known for miracles, signs and wonders,
    <br>this brings about envy, fights and jealousy of one another.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I pray every day
    <br>to see
    <br>when we will no longer fight, envy and be jealous of one another.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>I want to say to you that miracles, signs and wonders,
    <br>I mean, deliverance and healing, cannot be exchanged with money.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>Money has been hindering the move of God.
    <br>Colombia Crusade With
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua - Day 2
    <br>This occasion is an opportunity for all to give everything the Lord has given us -
    <br>our love, care, strength and money
    <br>because we have different classes of people here.
    <br>There are people that are needy; there are sick people.
    <br>There are people that are here and are thinking of how to go back home
    <br>because they have no money to go back home.
    <br>So, different people are here today.
    <br>We should use every proper means to win their souls.
    <br>Thank you.
