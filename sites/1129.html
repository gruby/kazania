  <p>    
    <br>Lying down in a helpless state, this man is 
    <br>suffering from a permanent erection.
    <br>It is a physical condition that has
    <br>gone beyond his natural control.
    <br>So his parents have brought him to 
    <br>the Synagogue Church of All Nations,
    <br>seeking a divine solution. Let's hear from them.
    <br>His manhood has been erect for the past 11 days now. It cannot come down.
    <br>Ok, stand up, my friend.
    <br>T.B. Joshua instructs the man to stand up for an encounter with the Holy Spirit.
    <br>With the finger of God, the Prophet prays
    <br> for him in the powerful name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>expelling all the shades of darkness that have caused his manhood to be permanently erect.
    <br>The Word of God is the tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit,
    <br>to heal you as it says in Isaiah 53:5,
    <br>"By His stripes, we are healed".
    <br>Prophet T.B. Joshua Ministering
    <br>Healing And Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>You are free!
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>My son is healed. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>After receiving healing in the name of Jesus Christ,
    <br>Mr Jude Alobo came back to the 
    <br>Synagogue Church of All Nations
    <br>to testify that the permanent erection has gone,
    <br>and his manhood is now back to normal.
    <br>Before and After
    <br>Free from pain and tension, Mr Jude 
    <br>gladly shows that his manhood is normal once again.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Glory be to God!
    <br>Brother, I want you to tap your body.
    <br>Tap it with your hands. Press it. How do you feel?
    <br>I feel very good now, very fine.
    <br>Very normal now. I'm good.
    <br>Were you able to touch your private part like this before?
    <br>No, I wasn't able to do that because I was in severe pain.
    <br>The erection wouldn't let me urinate.
    <br>Right now you're touching it. What do you have to say?
    <br>I give glory to God, I give thanks to God.
    <br>Touch it once again.
    <br>You mean the pain is gone?
    <br>The pain is gone totally.
    <br>To the glory of God, we can see the brother
    <br>who suffered from permanent erection,
    <br>he couldn't pass urine then without pain.
    <br>Every time he wanted to pass urine,
    <br>he was always experiencing terrible pain.
    <br>But right now we can see him passing urine without any pain, to the glory of God.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Jude Alobo.
    <br>Beside me are my mom and my dad.
    <br>I am a graduate. I'm from Benue State.
    <br>I studied building engineering at the University of Jos.
    <br>I came here because I had a permanent erection, asthma, depression and schizophrenia.
    <br>The problem started while I was in the university.
    <br>I was combining music and studies together,
    <br>but the music wasn't  forthcoming.
    <br>And I wasn't performing well in my studies 
    <br>so that led me into a depression.
    <br>I started taking drugs - marijuana and 
    <br>other drugs - and having casual sex with prostitutes.
    <br>But those drugs didn't work. Instead, they led me into illness.
    <br>I was taken to the hospital and I was
    <br>diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia.
    <br>I was prescribed drugs which I was taking 
    <br>but those drugs had strong side effects
    <br>which was causing me permanent 
    <br>erection that would last for four hours.
    <br>So I decided to stop taking the drugs.
    <br>When I went back to the hospital
    <br> for my regular check-up,
    <br>the doctor gave me an injection - a 
    <br>combination of all the drugs I was taking
    <br>which gave me a permanent 
    <br>erection that lasted for two months.
    <br>They took me to different hospitals,
    <br>different churches but the erection didn't go down.
    <br>I was in severe pain, I was in serious pain;
    <br>I couldn't stand straight, I couldn't sit 
    <br>down.
    <br>I had to lie down because the pain was so serious.
    <br>The doctor suggested I should go for an operation
    <br>which I refused because it was a 50/50 chance.
    <br>So I decided to come to the Synagogue Church of All Nations because I had seen so many people
    <br>with the same situation of permanent erection being healed here.
    <br>When I came here, the man of God prayed for me and I became healed.
    <br>The erection started going down
    <br> gradually and the pain started subsiding
    <br>and that was how I became okay.
    <br>Mr Jude Alobo & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>My word of advice to everyone
    <br>out there is to believe in God,
    <br>to trust in God - God is the only Healer.
    <br>Mr Jude Alobo & Family
    <br>Healing Testimony
    <br>People of God, Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Arubi Alobo, 
    <br>just like I've been introduced.
    <br>The reason we are here today is to give testimony
    <br>regarding the permanent erection of Jude Alobo.
    <br>He has said it all.
    <br>What I want to add is that the pain he felt -
    <br>if you were there, it was like you could feel it as well.
    <br>And so I described that pain as the father of all pains
    <br>because as he was writhing in pains,
    <br>indeed all of us were always crying.
    <br>But today, we have come back here to 
    <br>tell the whole world that God is here.
    <br>That whatever problem you have, 
    <br>that this is the only place
    <br>where you can come and receive healing.
    <br>I remember, while the pain was on,
    <br>we had to visit one hospital or the other.
    <br>We went to a particular doctor and
    <br> we told him about our condition.
    <br>He said we should try another doctor, that he could not handle it.
    <br>We went to a second doctor 
    <br>and he referred us to a hospital
    <br>where there are professionals
    <br>that could handle such a case.
    <br>When we went there, they said that 
    <br>we should go back to the hospital
    <br>where the whole thing started
    <br>and when we went to that very hospital,
    <br>the doctors said he would go through an operation -
    <br>an operation of which they said that it would be 50/50.
    <br>As he was not ready to go through such a thing, from there we drove straight to this place.
    <br>Right from the hospital, we came over to this place and here he received his healing.
    <br>And today he is well.
    <br>People of God, praise the Lord!
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>My advice to the whole world is that 
    <br>we should always listen to the voice of the Lord.
    <br>The voice of the Lord may not
    <br> be very clear to us at times,
    <br>but we have to be very careful to 
    <br>be able to discern when God is talking to us
    <br>so that we will follow the right path.
    <br>Testimony Time
    <br>My name is Alobo Roselyn.
    <br>When it started, we were all confused.
    <br>As a mother, the pain that your
    <br>son or daughter is going through -
    <br>you know that it touches a mother.
    <br>I cannot even count the tears I shed.
    <br>But I said, "God, you are there".
    <br>I have been watching Emmanuel TV for years now.
    <br>I said, "What He is doing for others,
    <br>He is going to do for me.
    <br>I'm not going to allow my son
    <br> to enter the theater for the operation.
    <br>I'm coming down here for his healing".
    <br>And my son, with his own belief, said that he will never enter the theater,
    <br>that he's coming down here, that God of T.B. Joshua will do it for him.
    <br>With his own belief and the trust we had in God,
    <br>we entered a vehicle from 
    <br>Jos and came down to the arena of liberty.
    <br>I was happy when I entered the arena of liberty.
    <br>I said, "Yes, my God will do it for me now".
    <br>Immediately the man of God touched 
    <br>my son, the pain was released.
    <br>He could not sit down, he could not lie 
    <br>down. Even to lie down was a problem.
    <br>As a mother, I was crying all the time.
    <br>So the whole thing just came down.
    <br>I thank God, I glorify His name!
    <br>Amen.
    <br>To God be the glory.
    <br>The advice I have for people all
    <br>over the world as a mother:
    <br>If your son is going through pain,
    <br>just have patience and trust in God.
    <br>Call on God and He is going to rescue you from that pain.
