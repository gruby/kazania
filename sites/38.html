    <br>DELIVERANCE TIME
    <br>During the Sunday live service at the SCOAN, Wiseman Christopher ministers prayer
    <br>in the power of the Holy Ghost to the people.
    <br>As he ministers spirit-filled prayer, every chain satan has used to connect the people to himself
    <br>is being disconnected in Jesus' name.
    <br>You can see the reaction of the people as Wiseman Christopher ministers prayer in Jesus' name.
    <br>The demons that are the cause of their problems are being exposed and removed in Jesus' name.
    <br>Get ready to watch what happens when Wiseman Christopher encounters this man.
    <br>Don't come to me!
    <br>Why?
    <br>I don’t want to see a man like you!
    <br>You don’t want to see a man like me?
    <br>I said I'm serious about this!
    <br>Now, bring down your hand.
    <br>We don't carry on missions that we cannot finish.
    <br>I must surely finish what I started.
    <br>Who are you?
    <br>I don’t know if you can do yours.
    <br>What is your mission?
    <br>Follow me.
    <br>You!
    <br>I know who you are!
    <br>This is the time!
    <br>Time to do what?
    <br>I'm going to show you my last power!
    <br>What is the power all about?
    <br>I destroy.
    <br>I kill.
    <br>I fornicate.
    <br>I disturb the peace of the people.
    <br>Nobody ever questioned me. How dare you?!
    <br>Let me tell you what you don't know.
    <br>This one is our own.
    <br>Which one?
    <br>We have destroyed so many of them.
    <br>But the Lord wants to save this one.
    <br>He cannot!
    <br>I knew that a day like this would come, when I would meet you one on one.
    <br>What other evil have you done?
    <br>We don’t and we can never work like children!
    <br>We are matured in the realm.
    <br>Which realm?
    <br>You don’t know?
    <br>You want to tell me you don’t know?
    <br>Jesus knows.
    <br>The name we don’t want to hear.
    <br>Get out!
    <br>Why?
    <br>You said you don’t want to hear the name of Jesus, why?
    <br>See!
    <br>You may be holding me
    <br>but let me tell you, you are not as strong as this man!
    <br>Stop that!
    <br>Stop that and answer me, you demon.
    <br>What is the evil you have done?
    <br>How did you enter this man's body?
    <br>Through many ways!
    <br>Like what?
    <br>In the dream!
    <br>We fed him many years ago in his dreams!
    <br>He is married to a wife in the spirit.
    <br>Do you think that you can take the wife away from him?
    <br>Though his future is bright, I don’t know if you can do that!
    <br>If you think you can, let's get to the battleground!
    <br>What other evil have you done?
    <br>Don't frustrate me!
    <br>I told you!
    <br>Or, you think I'm joking with you?
    <br>I know you are a man of God
    <br>but the power...
    <br>My last power – I will use it to fight the last battle, if this is the one.
    <br>What do you mean by the last battle?
    <br>The last mission in my life.
    <br>If I don’t destroy him, then the victory is yours.
    <br>How do you want to go about destroying him?
    <br>I know the family background.
    <br>What have you done to the family?
    <br>I know what they did in the family, before they gave birth to him.
    <br>They would have killed the mother
    <br>but God loves the mother and the son.
    <br>Both the parents are dead and the son will not live.
    <br>What did you do to the family?
    <br>Go and ask them in the village!
    <br>We almost finished the family!
    <br>The family is a family of ten, but it is only four that survived.
    <br>What happened to the other six?
    <br>Don’t question me, I told you!
    <br>How dare you to question a man like me?!
    <br>I said I'm strong in the realm.
    <br>That's why you see me today.
    <br>Let's get to the battleground!
    <br>I know you are one of the heads.
    <br>Are you not?
    <br>You want me to tell you all about you?
    <br>I'm just waiting for the last bell to ring, then the battle will begin.
    <br>What do you mean by the battle?
    <br>You cannot just cast a spirit out of a human without a fight.
    <br>It is a struggle!
    <br>Let's make it 50/50.
    <br>Do you know what I mean by that?
    <br>Go ahead and explain.
    <br>One of your body parts will be destroyed for you to save this one.
    <br>You think I'm joking, right?
    <br>Are you now ready for the battle?
    <br>Of course, yes!
    <br>Are you strong enough to withstand me? Then let's try it!
    <br>The battle for survival is not a personal challenge, but one against Jesus.
    <br>Are you ready?
    <br>Don't fight with me, please!
    <br>You said what?
    <br>I will call he who is stronger than me to fight you, right now!
    <br>Are you now ready to fight?
    <br>Yes, I am.
    <br>Can you stand right and get ready? Position yourself!
    <br>SPIRITUAL WARFARE | Demon Vs Pastor
    <br>Get ready. Is there any other thing you need to do?
    <br>Are you getting ready?
    <br>I command fire from Heaven.
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out, you demon!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Fire in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>Fire in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Help me!
    <br>Fire in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>No hiding place!
    <br>You cannot go beyond the Word of God, come back!
    <br>Come back here in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come!
    <br>Didn’t I tell you?
    <br>Come!
    <br>It would be 50/50 today!
    <br>Now, stop!
    <br>Are you still ready to fight?
    <br>SPIRITUAL WARFARE | Demon Vs Pastor
    <br>Stop!
    <br>Come back, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>At the count of three!
    <br>Didn’t I tell you?
    <br>Are you ready to lose one of your hands for him to be free?
    <br>Stop there!
    <br>I stopped.
    <br>That means I have surrendered but I can't just surrender.
    <br>I want to see more of your power.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Come out, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>SPIRITUAL WARFARE | Demon Vs Pastor
    <br>At the mention of the name "Jesus Christ" all knees shall bow.
    <br>Now go.
    <br>No!
    <br>What can I do for you to allow me?
    <br>Go.
    <br>No, because we don’t have anywhere to go.
    <br>I command you to go.
    <br>Move.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>SPIRITUAL WARFARE | Demon Vs Pastor
    <br>Move.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Stop!
    <br>SPIRITUAL WARFARE | Demon Vs Pastor
    <br>Where are you going?
    <br>Come back.
    <br>Come back here.
    <br>Allow me to be myself, but until the shoes are removed…
    <br>Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Out!
    <br>Pity me, please.
    <br>Go back to where you are coming from.
    <br>But this is the only home I have.
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Come out of him.
    <br>Come back here!
    <br>Holy Ghost fire, in the name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>Fire!
    <br>SPIRITUAL WARFARE | Demon Vs Pastor
    <br>What did you say?
    <br>What is happening now?
    <br>Where am I?
    <br>Tell me please!
    <br>Come here!
    <br>The Lord has set you free; relax.
    <br>Are you sure? Am I safe?
    <br>What is this?
    <br>Calm down.
    <br>What is happening here? Look at my clothes.
    <br>You said you were a demon.
    <br>That you possessed this body.
    <br>And you had a mission and your mission was in three categories -
    <br>to kill, to steal and to destroy.
    <br>No.
    <br>You destroyed a lot of people and you wanted to kill this brother.
    <br>They had ten people in the family and you succeeded in killing six;
    <br>only four remain now.
    <br>I only knew that there were a lot of problems in my family.
    <br>Almost all of my brothers are dead.
    <br>My parents are dead.
    <br>Even me, nothing is in place at all.
    <br>Sometimes, I think I should go drink poison and die.
    <br>There was a day, I was watching Emmanuel TV,
    <br>people were receiving miracles, in a restaurant where I went to eat.
    <br>I thought that one day I would visit the church and God would help me.
    <br>And here you are. The Lord has cast out...
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>I know I'm free!
    <br>I am free!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus! I am free!
    <br>In Jesus' name, I am free forever!
