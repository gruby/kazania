  <p>    
    <br>Viewers all over the world, we ask God for mercy and favour upon your life, upon your family.
    <br>Yes, the Lord says, rest - every area of your life!
    <br>Every area of your life you have challenges - I decree rest, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your health - receive rest, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>In your family and marriage - receive rest, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>With God, all things are possible!
    <br>It  is possible! I say it is possible!
    <br>Receive rest, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Yes, those challenges that are giving you sleepless nights -
    <br>it is time for rest, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say freedom!
    <br>God knows you better.
    <br>Whatever area of your life that is giving you sleepless nights, giving you nightmares -
    <br>be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can feel it, I know you are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I say, you are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>You are released, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Someone is somewhere releasing you right now -
    <br>in the person of the Holy Spirit!
    <br>Someone is busy releasing you!
    <br>Yes - continue to be released!
    <br>Give thanks to God!
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit and pray to meet you here again.
    <br>Allow your heart to be deeply engaged with God, as you send your testimony.
    <br>Engage with God.
