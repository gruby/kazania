    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>On the 29th of December 2013, Prophet T.B. Joshua prophesied a coming challenge in the aviation industry
    <br>that would negatively affect both passengers and airlines.
    <br>Let's listen to him.
    <br>Those of us that are into the business of airlines, aeroplanes, flying or whatever,
    <br>you will be at the airport for two or three days
    <br>and you may not get a flight to go to where you are going
    <br>because the demand will be more than supply.
    <br>There will be shortage of flying - airlines,                           airplane shortage.
    <br>The little that is on the ground will be destroyed, damaged
    <br>but new ones - nobody to purchase them.
    <br>It will be so difficult; the business will not be as usual.
    <br>Today, you get to the airport and you are waiting for a flight.
    <br>They will say, "No, the flight is not going".
    <br>It is still moderate.
    <br>Next year, it will be more serious
    <br>and that will make the flight ticket multiply by two - the one you are having now.
    <br>Because the demand is more than supply.
    <br>Most especially in Africa: It will affect Africa so much,
    <br>the Africa continent, most especially.
    <br>It will now become a transport on the ground.
    <br>You know when you are waiting at the bus stop,
    <br>it always takes time to get transport from one station to another
    <br>and if you now get it, you will have to fight to enter.
    <br>So also, the kind of picture I'm seeing happen.
    <br>The little we have is not well managed
    <br>and it is too old to even manage.
    <br>I am talking about the African continent - too old to manage
    <br>and 50 percent of this will be grounded.
    <br>And the remaining 50 percent, there will not be enough money to manage them.
    <br>So, those of us that fly from one country to another,  you should think twice -
    <br>what will happen next.
    <br>If your business is about flying from one country to another,
    <br>I think there will be a challenge
    <br>Step into the future.
    <br>Be the first to know.
    <br>Find out what God has to say concerning your situation, your country and the world.
    <br>God is still saying something.
    <br>A compilation of prophecies concerning individuals, nations and the world at large -
    <br>together with their confirmations.
    <br>I am seeing flame. What is the meaning of that?
    <br>In every situation God has something to say.
    <br>Find out what God has to say.
    <br>God is still saying something.
