    <br>Viewers all over the world, remember, there are different kinds of people.
    <br>As we are talking, some are on the sickbed.
    <br>As we are talking, some are imprisoned innocently.
    <br>As we are talking, some are suffering infirmities of all kinds.
    <br>Right now, stretch your hand.
    <br>Whatever situation you are in over there - be rescued, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be it in your health - be rescued, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Whatever area in your faculties,
    <br>whatever kind of sickness -
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot cure;
    <br>never a sickness Jesus cannot heal.
    <br>Be healed, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>Be rescued, in the name of Jesus!
    <br>I can see you being rescued!
    <br>I can see you being healed!
    <br>Because of Christ, I am rescued!
    <br>Because of Christ, I am healed!
    <br>Because of Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Lord!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Whatever is going on in your business, in your finances - be revived!
    <br>You, business - be revived!
    <br>Be revived!
    <br>In the name of Jesus.
    <br>Because of Christ, your business is revived!
    <br>Because of Christ, your finances are revived!
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>Give glory to God.
    <br>We leave you under the influence of the Holy Spirit
