  <p>    
    <br>My name is Mr Williams. I am from Akwa Ibom. I am 61 years old.
    <br>I have a BA in Music and Masters in Public Order.
    <br>I was a Principal Master, Grade 2 in a secondary school. I taught music.
    <br>I am here to make a confession.
    <br>I am a retired teacher.
    <br>While in the service, before I retired, I engaged myself in 419.
    <br>That is, I was a fake native doctor.
    <br>We worked in groups. My target was always a retired governor or top politician.
    <br>I would go to him and discuss with him.
    <br>I would ask him, "Why can't you go and contest an election?"
    <br>He would say, "Ah, I don't have money oo. The last time I went, I lost a lot of money".
    <br>I would tell him, "Don't worry, I will take you to a friend who is going to sponsor your election".
    <br>I would now take him to a friend of mine who was also a fake witch doctor.
    <br>When we got to the man, the man would...
    <br>You mean, sir, you would take him to a friend who is claiming,
    <br>pretending to be a witch doctor - a native doctor.
    <br>A native doctor but also a fake one.
    <br>When we got there, the man would ask him to pay a consultation fee of about 10 000.
    <br>He would pay. Then the man would look at the mirror and say, "Ok, you are going to win the election.
    <br>How much do you do want?" The man would say, "I need about 500 million".
    <br>He would say, "That is a small money".
    <br>He would tell him what he had to buy so that we would release the money to him.
    <br>When he bought those things and brought them, we would sacrifice them.
    <br>After sometime, the fake native doctor would tell the man
    <br>that he would have to pay 10% of the amount of money before he could carry it.
    <br>The man would calculate 10% of the 500 million and say, "I don't have up to that.
    <br>I have about 10 million in the house or 2 million".
    <br>He would say, "Ok, go and bring it". He would go and bring the money.
    <br>The native doctor had a pot where we burnt this money.
    <br>Inside that pot, there was a hole.
    <br>As soon as the man put that million in that pot, the money would just go down.
    <br>Then he would use ordinary paper to put on top.
    <br>There was a pipe connected inside the pot.
    <br>The fake native doctor would know how to put the money so that it would be on the pipe.
    <br>It would not be on the pot. Then we would use paper and grass, and light them.
    <br>The papers and the grasses would be burning.
    <br>The person would be thinking that that money was burning,
    <br>not knowing that there was a pipe inside.
    <br>After some time I would go back to the man; we would share the money.
    <br>After that, when the man came back again, we would enter the shrine.
    <br>The fake native doctor would ask him to bring the remaining money before he could carry the money.
    <br>He would say that he didn't have up to that.
    <br>He would then say, "Ok, go and bring whatsoever you have".
    <br>He would go and bring another money but it would not be up to the 10%.
    <br>We burnt the other money too. Then after that, we entered the shrine.
    <br>The native doctor would now ask him, "Since you don't have the money, go and bring a livestock -
    <br>bonga fish" - you know this fish, as soon as you bring it from the water, it will die.
    <br>So it is not easy to bring it to the man.
    <br>The man would think that it was a very simple something.
    <br>He would go to the riverside and ask for bonga fish. They would give it to him.
    <br>As soon as he got to the doctor, the fish would die.
    <br>He would ask him to go again. The man would repeat up to 5 or 6 times.
    <br>Then later on he would say, "Ok, since you cannot bring it,
    <br>go and find money and complete the amount so that you can carry the 500 million".
    <br>The man would go back again to look for money to come and give.
    <br>If he brought another money, we could change it and say, "Go and look for a white cat".
    <br>You know it's very impossible to find a pure white cat.
    <br>The man would go all over Nigeria looking for a cat without seeing it.
    <br>When the man was tired of it, he would not come; he would go away.
    <br>And that's how you would have collected huge amounts of money from that man.
    <br>Yes. That was how we collected the money from that man without the man knowing.
    <br>And at the end of the day, you never actually gave the money that he was asking for - the 500 million.
    <br>It would never be given to the man. You would have extorted, collected huge amounts.
    <br>He would never get the 500 million since he had not fulfilled the ritual.
    <br>After some time, these things started to worry me because I had made so many people cry.
    <br>I decided that I would come and make a confession.
    <br>Apart from that, as a civil servant, your colleague knows your basic or annual salary.
    <br>I was having millions. I was buying cars, building a house with this bad money.
    <br>So I decided to put Emmanuel TV in my house.
    <br>Sorry, sir. Before going ahead, we just want to understand as well.
    <br>Are you saying that your colleagues in the school where you were working were suspecting you
    <br>because the money you were having was a lot more than the salary you were earning as a teacher?
    <br>Yes, they were suspecting me because the money I had was more than my basic salary.
    <br>So to cover up, I established an Emmanuel TV fellowship centre in my place.
    <br>The people would be thinking that I was blessed because I used to come to Lagos.
    <br>When I came to Lagos, I would get the Morning Water.
    <br>Upon getting back home, I would give it to them free.
    <br>They would be thinking that I was blessed by Prophet T.B. Joshua,
    <br>not knowing that I was doing another thing.
    <br>Ok. I hope we are understanding what our father is saying.
    <br>That because of the amount of money he had obtained dubiously, in a deceptive manner,
    <br>people were suspecting him. So to cover this up, he actually established a centre
    <br>whereby people would come to watch Emmanuel TV in his house
    <br>so that people who came and saw the riches he had would attribute it to the fact
    <br>that he used to come to The SCOAN, visited Prophet T.B. Joshua, received the Morning Water,
    <br>not knowing that actually the source of the money that he had was these dubious activities
    <br>he was engaging in, pretending to be a witch doctor and deceiving people through that means.
    <br>So you mean to say, sir, that many people were coming to your house to watch Emmanuel TV,
    <br>not knowing that behind the scenes, you were involved in this 419.
    <br>Yes. Many would come because they love Emmanuel TV; they would come and watch it.
    <br>I even published it in a paper that it was free, that people should come and watch it.
    <br>I have never used the name of the church to dupe any person.
    <br>So you mean to say, sir, you published it in a local newspaper
    <br>that they should come to your house and watch Emmanuel TV.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Ok. So we are listening to our father giving this confession right now.
    <br>Now, sir, what was the reason that you actually decided finally to come down
    <br>to the church today and give this confession?
    <br>After I had stopped this 419 business for over 2 years,
    <br>I discovered that my son who is about 12 years started stealing.
    <br>I know that the spirit has transferred from me to him.
    <br>So I had to come to The SCOAN to confess.
    <br>And we want to understand, sir: All of the riches, the money you gained
    <br>through these deceitful practices, what did you end up using them for?
    <br>I made millions; on some days, I made up to 10 million but all this money -
    <br>if you ask me, I don't know where the money is now.
    <br>All the money is gone.
    <br>So you mean that you didn't use it for any good purpose?
    <br>I didn't use it for any good thing.
    <br>And right now as you are talking, the spirit that was in you, pushing you to these activities,
    <br>your son has now started stealing. And what are the kind of activities your son is doing?
    <br>My son started stealing in the school - he is in nursery school.
    <br>He would be deceiving people, "Give me 1000, tomorrow I will bring you 20 000".
    <br>And he would be collecting money from the small small boys.
    <br>So I actually know that the spirit has left me and entered him.
    <br>So now you are here in The SCOAN, sir, what do you want to say?
    <br>I want to ask for forgiveness.
    <br>I am a sinner. I have made so many people cry.
    <br>I  ask God to forgive me my sins.
    <br>People of God, we have listened to the confession of our father here.
    <br>Before we hear a last word from him, there are some important and valuable lessons
    <br>that we are learning from his experience. Remember that Prophet T.B. Joshua says:
    <br>Whatever satan gives you with his right hand that would seem to give you apparent peace
    <br>or money or joy, he will take from you with his left hand what your life depends on.
    <br>Because anything that starts dubiously will surely end dubiously.
    <br>There is an important lesson for us to learn.
    <br>We know there are many people - some maybe watching today
    <br>some may even be here in the church - who are still in that same type of business
    <br>and you feel that you are prospering on the outside,
    <br>you feel you have riches, you feel you have wealth, cars, properties
    <br>but what you are doing, the end result will lead to destruction.
    <br>As Prophet T.B. Joshua says: We should value processing more than results
    <br>because if the way and manner we go about things is not according to God's way,
    <br>the end results will be bad.
    <br>And you can see our father here - he is an educated man - as an elderly man,
    <br>at the time he is supposed to be enjoying the fruits of his labour,
    <br>he is facing this crisis. His own son is afflicted with this spirit.
    <br>The money that he made through these dubious practices has disappeared.
    <br>And he has come back to the house of God to give this type of confession.
    <br>What is your advice to people around the world, especially those watching now
    <br>who may still be involved in such activities?
    <br>My advice to the people all over the world and people watching me here:
    <br>Don't look for power and don't be greedy.
    <br>Once you look for power or you are greedy, you are open for people to dupe you.
    <br>Ok, sir, that is clearly an advice for those who are seeking things from other sources, outside of God.
    <br>People going to witch doctors, herbalists, thinking that they will be able to provide a solution.
    <br>But they are also many people like yourself who are actually deceiving individuals,
    <br>claiming to be what they are not and deceiving them.
    <br>For such people, what is your advice to them?
    <br>People who are still doing the same business I was doing, I would advice you to stay away from it.
    <br>It is not a good thing.
    <br>You make millions but at the end of the day, you don't see 1 kobo,
    <br>if you are lucky to escape from jail.
    <br>Standard For Life
    <br>My name is Mr Williams.
    <br>This is my first daughter Martha, 25 years,
    <br>my second daughter Ruth, 23 years,
    <br>my third daughter Abigail, 22 years,
    <br>my fourth daughter Esther, 21 years,
    <br>my fifth daughter Rebecca, 17 years,
    <br>my last daughter Sarah, 16 years, and my grandchild,
    <br>my first son Godswill,
    <br>my second son Aaron,
    <br>my nephew Nefreke Williams.
    <br>Mr Williams & Family 
    <br>Akwa Ibom, Nigeria
    <br>Ok, sir, you mean to say you are here with your 8 biological children and your nephew
    <br>and you have come back to The SCOAN with all your children.
    <br>Yes. I am here with my family. My six daughters, two boys and my nephew.
    <br>Sir, when you gave a confession here in The SCOAN last week,
    <br>you mentioned that one of your sons was having a particular problem.
    <br>Can just tell us who that son is and what the problem was he was having.
    <br>Ok, my first son Godswill was having a spiritual attack.
    <br>He used to steal. Now the problem is over; he has been delivered.
    <br>So you mean to say, sir, that after you gave your confession here at The SCOAN,
    <br>you subsequently brought your entire family,
    <br>including your young son who was afflicted with that spirit of stealing
    <br>so that they too can receive prayer and deliverance to start a new life.
    <br>Yes. Prophet T.B. Joshua gave me the transport money
    <br>to bring them from the village down here for deliverance.
    <br>And the man of God has prayed for all of us, including myself.
    <br>We thank God, sir. Can you just testify, sir, since you gave your confession last week,
    <br>what are the changes you have seen in your life?
    <br>Since my confession last week, I have been able to sleep without having nightmares,
    <br>eating with dead people or walking with dead people.
    <br>It has been a very good experience.
    <br>Now I have peace in my heart.
    <br>We give glory to God, sir, and we thank Jesus Christ for delivering our father
    <br>after he gave his confession here at The SCOAN,
    <br>how in the past satan really had used him to deceive and defraud a lot of people.
    <br>But today, he is here testifying to the glory of God with his entire family.
    <br>We thank Jesus Christ for that.
    <br>My name is Martha from Akwa Ibom State and my age is 25 years.
    <br>The problem we are facing right now is challenges in our school fees.
    <br>It's affecting me because all my mates have gone far.
    <br>I completed my SS3 in 2006.
    <br>I am just at home doing nothing.
    <br>I have been delivered, I thank God.
    <br>I believe I am saved, and my dad too has been delivered.
    <br>Glory be to God. We thank Jesus Christ for delivering our sister
    <br>and also our father here and the entire family.
    <br>My name is Defreke Williams. I am from Akwa Ibom State.
    <br>The man right beside me is my uncle.
    <br>I want to also use this great opportunity to thank The SCOAN and Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>In fact, he has been a great blessing to the entire family.
    <br>I am very much privileged to be one of those he has singled out and given this great favour.
    <br>We the children too had our challenges since we are not actually going on the way it should be.
    <br>But by the special grace of God, coming down to The SCOAN,
    <br>the man of God prayed for us and laid his hands on us
    <br>and right now as I am speaking to you, I feel the change already.
    <br>Glory be to God Almighty.
    <br>We thank God Almighty for what he has done in the life of this family.
    <br>My name is Godswill. I am from Akwa Ibom.
    <br>Your age?
    <br>I am 10 years old.
    <br>Who is the man beside you?
    <br>He is my father.
    <br>Before coming here, what was the problem you were having?
    <br>I used to steal.
    <br>Why did you use to steal?
    <br>Because satan would be pushing me to go and steal.
    <br>The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you. How are you feeling now?
    <br>I am feeling ok.
    <br>I am no longer going to steal again.
    <br>Glory be to God. We have heard from the little boy.
    <br>He has said that he has been delivered from that spirit that was pushing him to steal
    <br>as we listened to the confession of our father here.
    <br>My name is Sarah. I am from Akwa Ibom State.
    <br>Your age?
    <br>I am 16 years old.
    <br>We can see a baby in your hands. Who is this baby to you?
    <br>It's my baby.
    <br>Just tell us, sister, at the age of 16 you are having this baby. What actually led to this?
    <br>It was just a mistake and I have learnt from it.
    <br>I have learnt that education is the best.
    <br>So you mean because of the frustration in the family, that led you to go outside
    <br>at your young age and that actually led you to have this child.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Now that you have come to the church and Jesus has delivered you,
    <br>you are ready to start a new life in Christ?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You want to return to school now?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>So we listened to the family, just a few members of the family.
    <br>We can understand how the spirits that were affecting our father
    <br>had also affected the entire family, especially the children.
    <br>We have heard it from them that majority of them have been unable to continue their education.
    <br>They have been struggling to pay the school fees because the money that was gained
    <br>in the past through these illicit activities, as it was received from satan,
    <br>also went back to satan and was unable to be used for anything positive
    <br>or beneficial in the life of this family.
    <br>This is how this young family here has been suffering for many years.
    <br>But we give glory to God that deliverance has finally come.
    <br>And we here today with a message from Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>On behalf of Prophet T.B.Joshua and Emmanuel TV Partners,
    <br>the man of God said that he wants to support this family so that they can go back to school
    <br>in their various educational areas and also to stay close to Jesus Christ,
    <br>and continue in the new life they have received by receiving deliverance.
    <br>So we here to present to our baba here on behalf of the entire family, the sum of 300 000 Naira
    <br>which is a blessing for this family to start a new life in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Mr Williams & Family Receives 300,000 Naira 
    <br>From T.B. Joshua And Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>So once again, this is a sum of 300,000 Naira alongside the Word of God which is The Mirror
    <br>as a reminder for this family, to make the Word of God the standard for their lives.
    <br>This blessing is a gift so that the children can be assisted back to their schools
    <br>and that the family can start a new life now that deliverance has come.
    <br>Our father can begin a new clean business in which we know that God Almighty will bless him
    <br>to continue the journey and take care of his children.
    <br>Sir, what can you say about this blessing?
    <br>I thank Prophet T.B. Joshua and Emmanuel TV partners all over the world,
    <br>the ushers and all members of this church for taking care of us for the past 1 week we have been here.
    <br>May God bless them all.
    <br>I never expected something like this.
    <br>I thank God.
    <br>We believe you are going to use this blessing to take care of your children
    <br>and to start a new life and a fresh start.
    <br>I am going to use this blessing to start a new life and take care of my children.
    <br>I will not go back to a criminal life again.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ. We give all the glory to God.
    <br>Finally, sir, we would like to ask: What is your advice to our viewers all over the world?
    <br>My advice to the viewers all over the world is that they should stay away from crime.
    <br>Crime is not a good thing.
    <br>Whenever they have a problem, instead of running away from God,
    <br>they should run to God. God is there, ready to deliver them.
    <br>My name is Esther. I am from Akwa Ibom State.
    <br>I am 21 years old.
    <br>And who is the man standing beside you?
    <br>He is my father.
    <br>First and foremost, I am grateful to God Almighty for everything he has done for us.
    <br>And I am also very grateful to Prophet T.B. Joshua for his gift to my family.
    <br>I am equally grateful to all Emmanuel TV partners all over the world.
    <br>Thank you. God bless you all.
    <br>Of course, with the money that Prophet T.B. Joshua has given to my father,
    <br>I believe he is going to make judicious use of it.
    <br>He is going to maybe start a business with it so that he can support the family
    <br>and put us through our academics.
    <br>I believe all of you have chosen already to follow Jesus Christ and give your life fully to Him.
    <br>We are.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus Christ. Once again, we thank God for this family.
    <br>We pray that God will give everyone here the grace to continue to stay close to Jesus,
    <br>make the Word of God the standard for your lives,
    <br>and we believe you are all coming back with more wonderful testimonies, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
