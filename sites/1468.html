  <p>    
    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>You may do as the Spirit directs.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Thank you...
    <br>You want me to say in "traditional language".
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>Let me welcome you once more to our meeting.
    <br>We shall continue the message, "Love".
    <br>Our proof text is taken from the Book of 1 Corinthians 13:1-end,
    <br>but the proof text is verse 13.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>For more details, for more understanding of this message;
    <br>you can also find it in 1 John 4:7-12.
    <br>Also in the Book of Romans 13:9-10.
    <br>For more clarification; you have it in the Book of Colossians 3:12-14.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>Let me read this verse 1 Corinthians 13:1-3.
    <br>“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love..
    <br>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
    <br>and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
    <br>If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,
    <br>but do not have love, I gain nothing.”
    <br>Let me go to the proof text; verse 13.
    <br>1 Corinthians 13:13, “And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.
    <br>But the greatest of these is love.”
    <br>Once again; you have more details in the Book of Colossians 3:12-14,
    <br>and the Book of Romans 13:9-10,
    <br>and also 1 John 4:7-12.
    <br>WE ARE KNOWN BY OUR LOVE – PART 2
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You are known by your love.
    <br>I cannot hear you.
    <br>I am known by my love.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 13:13,
    <br>the greatest in the sight of God is the one who loves his neighbour.
    <br>The greatest in the sight of God is the one who loves his fellow man.
    <br>The greatest!
    <br>That is where we find faith, love, hope...
    <br>I repeat again:
    <br>The greatest in the sight of God is the one who loves his fellow man.
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your fellow man
    <br>and your fellow man can be someone who does not want to see any good in you.
    <br>Your fellow man can be the one who derides evil in you.
    <br>Your fellow man can be the one who criticizes you.
    <br>He can be your enemy.
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your fellow man.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>You cannot love God without loving your fellow man.
    <br>Can you see the problem we have with God,
    <br>the challenges you have with your spiritual life?
    <br>You claim to love God but you do not love your fellow man.
    <br>Let us love one another irrespective of religion or race.
    <br>Irrespective of your background, let us love one another
    <br>for love comes from God.
    <br>Whoever does not love does not know God.
    <br>If you do not love, you do not know God because God is love.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>In the Book of Romans 13, it says God measures our lives by our love for Him
    <br>and for our neighbour.
    <br>He measures our life by our love for Him and for our neighbour.
    <br>Anyone who does not love his neighbour whom he has seen
    <br>cannot love God whom he has not seen.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>Anyone who does not love his fellow man whom he has seen
    <br>cannot love God whom he has not seen.
    <br>Don't you see?
    <br>It is not possible.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>If I don’t love you, I cannot love God.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Today we love God, but hate our people because it is your enemy.
    <br>This is hypocrisy.
    <br>Anyone who does not love his fellow man whom he has seen
    <br>cannot love God whom he has not seen.
    <br>Your fellow man can be your enemy.
    <br>This is His command: Whoever loves God must also love his fellow man.
    <br>If truly you love God, you must also love your fellow man.
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 13:1, it says if we have all knowledge and ability but have no love,
    <br>we have nothing.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>In 1 Corinthians 13:3-5, He said:
    <br>If you have made all efforts, sacrifices, but have no love,
    <br>have no real burning love for God and your neighbour, you have nothing.
    <br>WE ARE KNOWN BY OUR LOVE – PART 2
    <br>Love for fellow man breaks down all barriers.
    <br>That is why I am here today.
    <br>Love for fellow man breaks down all barriers; it melts all hindrances.
    <br>No matter the hindrance - with the love of God, it melts.
    <br>It dissolves prejudices, misunderstanding and suspicion; love for fellow man.
    <br>Love has ears to hear the heart.
    <br>With love, you can hear people’s hearts.
    <br>With the love of God, you can understand the people’s hearts.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>Sometimes people will be telling you, "It's OK",
    <br>whereas in his heart, it is not OK.
    <br>With the love of God, you can hear the voice of the heart of people
    <br>and understand the heart of people.
    <br>How do we assess our love for God?
    <br>By the practical things in our life.
    <br>We assess the love of God by the number of times we lovingly think of Jesus daily.
    <br>How do we think of Him?
    <br>Don’t forget, Jesus and His Word are one.
    <br>Meditation in His Word is a visit to Him.
    <br>If you want to visit Him, mediate in His Word.
    <br>By meditation, we become one with Him.
    <br>You become one with Jesus by meditation.
    <br>It is the route. It is the access. It is the way.
    <br>The degree of hunger we have to read His Word -
    <br>I mean, the amount of time we save to read His Word.
    <br>In Romans 13:9-10, the more you love God, the more His Word becomes precious to you.
    <br>The more you love God, the more His Word becomes precious to you
    <br>because God and His Word are one.
    <br>How we assess our love for God:
    <br>There are a number of things in your life that you have adjusted.
    <br>I take again.
    <br>There are a number of things in your life that you have adjusted.
    <br>Thou shall not steal – you have stopped stealing because you long to please Him.
    <br>Thou shall not lie – you have stopped lying because you long to please Him.
    <br>Thou shall not destroy – you have stopped destroying because you long to please Jesus.
    <br>And so on and so forth.
    <br>How do you use your money because of your love for God?
    <br>How do you economise so as to give more to others because of your love for Jesus?
    <br>Ask your neighbour,
    <br>How do you economise so as to give more to others because of your love for Jesus?
    <br>How do you use your leisure time because of your love for Jesus?
    <br>In what little way do you bless others because of your love for Jesus?
    <br>How often do you say “God bless you” because of your love for Jesus?
    <br>How many people have you said this to today – “God bless you” because of your love for Jesus?
    <br>No.
    <br>Let us look at some ways by which we assess our love for our neighbour.
    <br>Colossians 3:12-14
    <br>By your willingness to overlook the mistake of your neighbour.
    <br>By your willingness to overlook the failures of your neighbour.
    <br>By your willingness to overlook the weaknesses of your neighbour,
    <br>the shortcomings of your neighbour.
    <br>If you are able to overlook all of these, then this is genuine love.
    <br>This is genuine love because there is no perfect man on earth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour,
    <br>By your willingness to overlook the failures of your neighbour.
    <br>By your willingness to overlook the mistake of your neighbour,
    <br>the weaknesses, shortcomings of your neighbour.
    <br>If you are able to overlook all of these, then there is genuine love
    <br>because there is no perfect man on earth.
    <br>Nazareth Meeting With T.B. Joshua – Day 2
    <br>So, think about this.
    <br>I know that even if I stood here for 5 hours talking and talking and talking,
    <br>only the Spirit of God can make you do what I'm saying,
    <br>because the heart of man is very...
    <br>Some are saying, "What does this man say? Who can do what he says?"
    <br>I think we need deliverance.
