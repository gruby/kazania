    <br>Good Morning!
    <br>Good Morning. Good Morning. It is a new dawn.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I know your faith is lifted up.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is no way our faith can be lifted up without repentance.
    <br>Do you know that?
    <br>The Bible says that sin is never covered by our appearance.
    <br>This is what we believe today.
    <br>Sin is never covered by our appearance
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Sin is never covered by our appearance.]
    <br>Wrong is never covered by our prayer.
    <br>Prayer without repentance - we are talking to the air,
    <br>you are just making noise.
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>Our wrong, our sin, our mistake is never covered by our prayer.
    <br>I mean, prayer without repentance is never covered by our tears.
    <br>Sin can only be removed by repentance.
    <br>Wrong can only be removed by repentance.
    <br>And what is repentance? Simple.
    <br>You begin to step into repentance when you stop blaming others.
    <br>Your business is not good, you say, "Oh, it's witchcraft.
    <br>That is how it happened to our family -
    <br>my brother is not making it, my sister is not making it".
    <br>But when you are making it, when business is good, you say, "It's my hard working.
    <br>I am a graduate, I am a professor".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>When the goings are good, and you are making it, business is flourishing,
    <br>you say, "Oh my God, I wake up early in the morning, I clicked to my business". 
    <br>You know what I am talking about.
    <br>But when business is bad, you begin to look for witches.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You decide not to go home; you abandon your village because business is not going.
    <br>They are the ones haunting you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Repentance comes when we stop blaming others
    <br>Tell your neighbour.
    <br>[Repentance comes when we stop blaming others.]
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Repentance comes when we stop blaming others.]
    <br>When it happens to you, you say, "Yes" - reproach
    <br>because of the pain you are going through.
    <br>Who is going through the pain? Is it witchcraft?
    <br>What you are going through, who is going through it? Is it wizard?
    <br>It is you that is going through the pain.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Repentance comes when you stop blaming others".
    <br>"I have been married for many years, no child, I have been barren.
    <br>Things have been very difficult. It is the same thing with my brothers at home.
    <br>This is trouble in the family."
    <br>You are shifting the blame.
    <br>But when things are good, you say it's your work.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Sin can only be removed by repentance.
    <br>It must be brought to the Blood of Jesus before the Spirit prays through us.
    <br>Our situation to where?
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Blood of Jesus.]
    <br>It must be brought to the Blood of Jesus before the Spirit prays through us.
    <br>The Blood of Jesus
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>The Blood of Jesus
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>From sin and sorrow
    <br>The Blood of Jesus sets me free
    <br>It must be brought to the Blood of Christ before the Spirit prays through us.
    <br>We don't know how to pray; the Spirit prays.
    <br>MESSAGE TITLE: REPENTANCE
    <br>What do you think can hold you back?
    <br>Pain of the past, anger, hurt of the past - deep hurt.
    <br>"The man came from the village, the boy came from the village, the lady came from the village.
    <br>I homed him, I homed her. He lived with me.
    <br>I trained him, I sent him to university.
    <br>I trained him. Now he is a millionaire but he abandoned me.
    <br>He refused to pay me back. I will not forgive him."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>There is a lot of issue with you and your people.
    <br>"I trained him. He is the head of the company but he refuses to hear from me again."
    <br>This pain of the past.
    <br>In your spirit now you rise and say to the Lord:
    <br>Give me the Grace to forget the pain of the past and be kind to those who hurt me.
    <br>Say it again.
    <br>Lord, give me the grace to forget the pain of the past, injustice of the past,
    <br>cheats of the past and to be kind to those who hurt me.
    <br>Oh my God, you are hurt. You have been cheated.
    <br>These are the things that are holding you back.
    <br>Oh, they sacked you, injustice, sacked you without pay,
    <br>even unnoticed sack letter after serving for many years.
    <br>You say, "No, this is injustice you will never forget and forgive".
    <br>You must forgive.
    <br>This is what is holding you back.
    <br>"No! My wife, my husband threw my things out after building his career and his future.
    <br>Now he is a rich man. Look, he married a new wife.
    <br>And here I am out there. I will never forgive this man."
    <br>These are the things that are holding you back.
    <br>"Oh, I can never. This is so painful. I hate him."
    <br>"I brought him up. See today, he is calling me wizard, witch. I can never..."
    <br>These are the things that are holding you back.
    <br>See Jesus - "Father, forgive them."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>He loves me
    <br>I cannot say why
    <br>On Calvary Tree
    <br>He suffered for me
    <br>He loves me
    <br>I cannot say why
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What you have forgotten is that
    <br>God often uses circumstances of life to preserve us.
    <br>Those things you see as pain, cheating, injustice -
    <br>God often uses them to preserve us, to keep us, to train us, to rebuild us but we don't know.
    <br>Are you with me?
    <br>God often uses circumstances of life.
    <br>You have been praying to be this, to be a senator, to be a president, to be that.
    <br>If you had been a president, who knows what would have happened to you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>What you have been praying for in the past,
    <br>if your prayer had been answered, who knows what would have happened to you?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask your neighbour:
    <br>What I have been praying for in the past - fasting and praying -
    <br>if my prayer had been answered, who knows what would have happened?
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God often uses circumstance of life.
    <br>And what are the circumstances?
    <br>What you see as injustice, hate, cheating, pain.
    <br>"This is embarrassment, this is cheating - he cheated me!"
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>"He sacked me, unnoticed, after serving for many years which is injustice."
    <br>Sometimes, God uses this kind of situation to preserve, to keep us for a new level
    <br>and to prepare us for a bright future.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Rise up right now. Let us pray for the viewers.
    <br>Let us open our lips, ask God to help us.
    <br>Give us the grace, Lord, to forget the pain of the past.
    <br>Pain can be this, can be that, can be injustice -
    <br>whatever pain, to forget the pain of the past.
    <br>Not only to forget the pain of the past - to be kind to those who hurt us in the past.
    <br>Open your lips, ask God
    <br>Give me the grace, Lord - grace to forget the pain of the past,
    <br>grace to forget the injustice of the past and to be kind to those who hurt me.
    <br>Prayer!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You are released from the pain, in the name of Jesus.
    <br>Right now, open your lips.
    <br>Ask Him to give you the grace to live according to His Word.
    <br>That is the only way to maintain what you have received.
    <br>If you know you have received, you need maintenance.
    <br>Give me the grace to live according to Your Word.
    <br>Your Word says, "Thou shall not kill, thou shall not lie, thou shall not steal, thou shall not destroy."
    <br>Give me the grace, Lord, to live according to your Word.
    <br>If you know your life has been fixed, right now, ask for grace to live according to His Word.
    <br>Open your lips.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
    <br>I can't hear you.
    <br>[Amen!]
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>I want to rejoice with you!
    <br>I know why I am rejoicing with you -  I am in the midst of...
    <br>successful people!
    <br>I said it.
    <br>Whether you like it or not, you are a successful person!
    <br>Stretch your hand and pray for your nation, your country,
    <br>for unity among your leaders.
    <br>Prayer For The Nations
    <br>With Prophet T.B. Joshua
    <br>God intervention,
    <br>in Jesus Christ's name!
    <br>Right now, your journey.
    <br>God owns our future.
    <br>Ask God to give you the grace to continue the journey - journey of righteousness,
    <br>purity, holiness, faithfulness.
    <br>Ask God for the grace to be kind to those who hurt you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Ask for the grace.
    <br>In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
