    <br>Lord Jesus,
    <br>I come before You,
    <br>believing it is Your will to set me free.
    <br>Say right now, "Lord Jesus,
    <br>I come before You,
    <br>believing
    <br>it is Your will
    <br>to set me free".
    <br>Once again.
    <br>Lord Jesus, I come before You believing it is Your will to set me free.
    <br>Indeed, it is His will to set you free.
    <br>Right now tell your neighbour, "I know the power I am under!"
    <br>Tell your neighbour once again.
    <br>I know the power I am under!
    <br>Let us thank Him for watching over His Word to set you free today.
    <br>Give thanks to Him for watching over His Word.
    <br>Give thanks to God for watching over His Word.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Listen,
    <br>your freedom is as close to you as your mouth.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "Your freedom today
    <br>is as close to you
    <br>as your mouth".
    <br>DISCONNECT YOURSELF From Evil Spirits!!! | MASS PRAYER With TB Joshua
    <br>This means, God has set a table before me.
    <br>I am telling you that God has set a table before you.
    <br>If the table is set, what next?
    <br>What next?
    <br>You have scored 50%.
    <br>Right now, open your lips and begin to command all spirits.
    <br>Some of these spirits use our faculties.
    <br>What you want to look at is not what you are looking at.
    <br>What you intend to think of is not what you are thinking.
    <br>You find yourself doing things against your will.
    <br>You wake up in the morning and you want to do the right thing,
    <br>but you find some strange things begin to control you.
    <br>Where you intend to go is not where you find yourself going.
    <br>All spirits
    <br>operating in your faculties,
    <br>whatever part of your body they are using,
    <br>begin to disconnect yourself!
    <br>Disconnect yourself!
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Mass Prayer
    <br>In the mighty name of Jesus Christ!
    <br>I want to tell you,
    <br>what you are asking for now, it is not for you,
    <br>but for your life in Christ.
    <br>You are not asking for blessing,
    <br>you are not asking for healing,
    <br>you are not asking for prosperity,
    <br>you are not asking for fame,
    <br>but you are asking for a proper relationship with God.
    <br>Open your lips. Sin's power over your life - be broken! Prayer!

    <br>This is a prophetic word - get ready for your testimony.
    <br>You know what it means when satan looses his grip - all things are possible.
    <br>When satan looses his grip,
    <br>when you are weak then you are strong.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "When satan looses his grip
    <br>on you
    <br>when you are weak, then you are strong".
    <br>When satan looses his grip on you, when you are weak, then you are strong.
