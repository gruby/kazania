  <p>    
    <br>Good morning everybody.
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Titilola Siphiwe Labode.
    <br>I'm from Zimbabwe. I'm half Nigerian and half Zimbabwean.
    <br>The woman beside me is my mother, Honourable Doctor Ruth Labode from Zimbabwe as well.
    <br>I will start my testimony with the crisis.
    <br>I went to university in England in 2004.
    <br>I picked up certain habits that affected me.
    <br>These habits included smoking and drinking.
    <br>I used to smoke and drink for eight years.
    <br>It was quite bad as it wasn't one or two cigarettes a day. I used to smoke twenty cigarettes a day.
    <br>My parents used to send me money for my tuition, my accommodation and my welfare.
    <br>They never wanted me to have a job while I was studying.
    <br>They wanted me to complete my studies without working.
    <br>But because my smoking and drinking habits were quite expensive in the UK,
    <br>I secretly got myself a job to support my drinking and smoking habits.
    <br>It was really bad because I passed with a 2.2 degree in BSc Accounting
    <br>but I spent most of my time out.
    <br>I would go out everyday. I would be in the club smoking and drinking.
    <br>It was just by the grace of God that nothing bad happened to me.
    <br>But I wasn't in good health.
    <br>I was very skinny and had bad skin.
    <br>I just wasn't healthy.
    <br>After a while, my parents begged me to come back home to Zimbabwe.
    <br>I used to refuse, saying that I was fine. I was ok in England -
    <br>working and being independent.
    <br>The people that I surrounded myself with were also smokers and drinkers.
    <br>So to me it was a normal life.
    <br>I would say that this is normal life here.
    <br>You are just in Africa and backwards.
    <br>You don't understand.
    <br>Eventually my mom and dad convinced me to move back to Zimbabwe where I grew up.
    <br>They brought me to The SCOAN in June 2014.
    <br>When I came to The SCOAN, I was placed in the prayer line.
    <br>I received Morning Water and was also blessed.
    <br>The man of God Prophet T.B. Joshua laid his hand on me.
    <br>When he laid his hand on me,
    <br>I felt this electricity going through my body.
    <br>Then after that, he didn't touch me. He just moved his hand and I fell on the floor.
    <br>I was conviced that someone had pulled me down.
    <br>Because afterwards I went to my mom and said,
    <br>"Mom, somebody pulled me down so that I could fall".
    <br>And then she said, "No, you were by yourself", although I was conviced otherwise.
    <br>But then when I was at home, I watched the video and saw that there was no one standing next me.
    <br>I went back home and tried to go back to my habit of smoking.
    <br>I was trying to force the issue because to me it was cool to be having a cigarette and a drink when being out.
    <br>But when I started smoking, I started feeling sick.
    <br>I would feel like I had a lot of phlegm and mucus in my throat.
    <br>I would feel tired and dizzy.
    <br>It just wasn't going well with my body anymore.
    <br>So eventually, I started cutting down and then stopped smoking.
    <br>Whilst I used to smoke, drink and go out in England,
    <br>I used to have a lot of bad dreams.
    <br>I would dream of snakes.
    <br>I would dream of having intercourse.
    <br>I would have bad dreams, dreaming of scorpions, spiders and all sorts.
    <br>After my deliverance at The SCOAN, I had a dream about Prophet T.B. Joshua.
    <br>He actually came to me in the dream.
    <br>I was holding a cigarette in my hand like this.
    <br>He came to me and pulled it out of my mouth and broke it in half.
    <br>I believe that that was where my deliverance started, from that dream where he actually visited me.
    <br>I want to give glory to the Lord because I am now a new creation in Christ and I am much healthier and happier.
    <br>Hallelujah.
    <br>Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Before when I would try to stop smoking on my own,
    <br>I would stop for three months.
    <br>But then if someone was smoking in front of me, I would follow them and inhale the smoke
    <br>because I would be craving for it.
    <br>It would be the same with drinking as I would try to stop drinking
    <br>but I would then secretly buy myself a bottle of wine and go to my room.
    <br>But then I was just deceiving myself because at the end of the day I was still drinking
    <br>and God knew that I was still drinking.
    <br>But after the man of God touched me,
    <br>even if someone would smoke next to me, I would actually move away as it is now like poison to me.
    <br>I don't want the smell of smoke next to me.
    <br>Even with alcohol, I no longer crave for it.
    <br>Before, I would crave for it and had to have a glass of red wine every day.
    <br>It was a must. My mouth just wouldn't feel right without it.
    <br>But now, I don't even think about alcohol.
    <br>I'm happy and fresh.
    <br>I'm a new creation.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Now, we want you to paint a clearer picture of how bad the situation was
    <br>when you were having this addiction to smoking and drinking.
    <br>What are some of those terrible moments that you find difficult to forget
    <br>when you were having this problem?
    <br>I will give you a couple of experiences that I had that were very bad.
    <br>I was out with my friends and I got very drunk.
    <br>I started vomiting in public.
    <br>My friends wanted to stay out and didn't care about how I was feeling.
    <br>So I spent the night in the club toilet being sick and vomiting.
    <br>The last terrible experience I had was when I came back to Zimbabwe.
    <br>I came back with that lifestyle because I was from England.
    <br>I continued it in Zimbabwe.
    <br>I went out. I drank a lot. I smoked 20 cigarettes that night.
    <br>When I got home, I was so dizzy.
    <br>I couldn't walk.
    <br>The door of the car was opened and I came crawling out of my car.
    <br>We have dogs at home and the situation was so bad that they were crawling beside me to the front door.
    <br>That is where my mother was and she looked at me in disgust.
    <br>When I think about it now, I feel sad.
    <br>But at the time, I would be annoyed at her and think, "What is her problem?
    <br>This is how I have always lived my life. She can't just try and change me".
    <br>That was my attitude before.
    <br>I didn't understand why she was trying to stop me from what I wanted to do
    <br>because to me that was normal.
    <br>When I look back at it, I feel sad and it is heart breaking.
    <br>One wastes so much time and spends so much money on things that just destroy your body.
    <br>When the Lord God gives you life and gives you Jesus, it is all that you need.
    <br>So I'm just grateful.
    <br>Hallelujah! Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>You said that all this while you were smoking and drinking,
    <br>what were you doing and how were you able to source for money
    <br>in order to keep us these bad habits?
    <br>As I mentioned earlier, I went to England to study at university.
    <br>My parents did not want me to work but to rather focus on my studies.
    <br>But because of my habits, that they were not aware of,
    <br>I went and got a part-time job.
    <br>I was working in a call centre while I was at university.
    <br>I used the money that they sent me to buy cases of cigarettes.
    <br>Especially at the airport when returning from a visit to Zimbabwe where cigarettes are very cheap,
    <br>I would buy cases of cigarettes and my mom wouldn't know.
    <br>She had no idea. In Africa when a child is misbehaving like that,
    <br>it makes the parent look bad.
    <br>But I didn't care. I would be saying that this was my addiction, my habit and my right.
    <br>I would buy cases of cigarettes and when I got to England,
    <br>I would smoke Marlboro and Marlboro cigarettes are very expensive.
    <br>Those are the ones that I wanted.
    <br>It left me broke all the time.
    <br>My dad even gave me his credit card one time
    <br>because he thought he was being considerate to his daughter and he loves me.
    <br>But he didn't know that I was supporting my bad habit with his money.
    <br>And now all of this is over?
    <br>Yes, all things of the past. I have found God now so I'm happy.
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus one more time!
    <br>Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>This is me while at university on a night out with my friends.
    <br>If you look closely, you will see that I'm holding a cigarette in my hand.
    <br>That's us in the club. We were just having drinks and cigarettes.
    <br>Ok. Point to yourself in the picture.
    <br>That's me in the middle.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>Over there. That is a cigarette.
    <br>If I zoom in for you, you can see the cigarette in my hand.
    <br>Ok.
    <br>You can also see my friends having cigarettes. We were all smokers.
    <br>We were all into the same.
    <br>That is another picture of me at a house party in summer time in England.
    <br>Where are you in the picture?
    <br>I was at a place called Grimsby. That is me over there.
    <br>Wow.
    <br>That is me lying down, holding a cigarette yet again.
    <br>And you can see the box on my lap.
    <br>If you look closely on my lap, you can see a box of cigarettes there.
    <br>That was my habit, that was my life.
    <br>It wasn't good.
    <br>To God be the glory! Now old things have passed away, all things have become new, right?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Let's put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>As the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, says, "When Jesus Christ enters our life,
    <br>He puts an end to our past and gives birth to our future".
    <br>Today, we thank God Almighty for the life of our sister
    <br>who has been delivered from her past life of smoking and drinking
    <br>and now she is a new creation in Christ Jesus.
    <br>Old things have passed away.
    <br>Glory be to God in the highest!
    <br>Emmanuel! (God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>By the grace of God, I am Honourable Doctor Ruth Labode,
    <br>a member of parliament in Zimbabwe.
    <br>I actually urged my daugher to give this testimony.
    <br>Not so much about her testimony but as a message to parents.
    <br>We work hard every day.
    <br>We chase money. We chase money like we are chasing the wind
    <br>because we want our children to live well.
    <br>We then send them abroad
    <br>without preparing them for the evil that is in the world.
    <br>We think because we can pay for the school fees
    <br>and the child passes the exams, that is it. That is not it.
    <br>When the child is not ready, the devil is waiting for the child somewhere in hell or in Liverpool.
    <br>The child is not prepared as the parents have not taken their child to God.
    <br>You have not taken your child to God because you yourself are a lukewarm Christian.
    <br>That is not important to you.
    <br>Yet, that is the most important thing and to prepare your child for what they will face in the world.
    <br>I believe it is wrong for us parents.
    <br>I know for sure.
    <br>What was important to me before was that my husband and I have paid the school fees.
    <br>Then we would phone and follow up on whether the child had passed the exams.
    <br>We didn't know that in the meantime the child was decaying.
    <br>The child was just dying a natural death in real life.
    <br>Yes, by the grace of God, they are passing the exams.
    <br>But what is to become of them in the future, that certificate may be useless.
    <br>I'm really urging parents.
    <br>We need to take our children to God. Especially when they are young.
    <br>We shouldn't just take them to church
    <br>because I took them to church but they were just playing around in church,
    <br>going to Sunday School and doing nothing.
    <br>After that we would go to KFC and then go home.
    <br>We didn't even discuss what we heard in church.
    <br>So it was a religious approach to things.
    <br>That religious approach is what caused her to not go to any church service
    <br>over the four to seven years she was in the UK.
    <br>She never learnt anything because her Sunday school was a nursery school.
    <br>Whilst I as the mother was attending the church service, she was playing.
    <br>So what I'm asking parents to know is that this is a terrible world.
    <br>Let's be careful and protect our children.
    <br>It is not by our strength but by taking them the person who gave them to you in the first place.
    <br>The gift is from Jesus, He's the one who gave them in the first place.
    <br>I will take you to Matthew 7:16-20 where it is said that a mango cannot beget a pineapple.
    <br>It means the people to blame for these children
    <br>or in other words, when you see your child misbehaving, look at yourself.
    <br>That is your mirror. That is you.
    <br>So what I am trying to say is that we should blame ourselves for what has become of our children.
    <br>My husband and I have blamed ourselves
    <br>because for sure, we were in the world,
    <br>even whilst we were doing some religious activities on Sundays.
    <br>But the truth is we were in the world.
    <br>So what did we pass on to our children? The worldly things.
    <br>Later when my daughter came back to Zimbabwe, I did not know she was smoking.
    <br>She used to sneak out during the night to the garden and smoke. Then, she came back into the house.
    <br>We thought all was well.
    <br>The day I started seeing her drinking habit getting worse was when I knew I was in trouble.
    <br>I started pumping her with Morning Water.
    <br>Sometimes she would be sleeping on her bed and I would go in her room.
    <br>I would spray the room, spray her and I would pray.
    <br>I would pray and say, "God, please, I have failed. I'm handing over this child to you.
    <br>You gave me this child. Redeem this child from this habit".
    <br>So when we came and the child was finally delivered, I found joy.
    <br>I found joy because she is now actually a lay preacher at our church.
    <br>For me that is actually extraordinary, comparing it with where she is coming from.
    <br>Wow! Put your hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Hon. Dr Ruth Labode & Daughter - Deliverance testimony
    <br>Were you with her at the prayer line section where the man of God prayed for her?
    <br>Tell us - what happened?
    <br>I was with her at the prayer line. It was herself, the dad and I.
    <br>When the man of God just waved his hand, she fell.
    <br>In fact, I was worried that she was going to be injured.
    <br>She fell down and in the meantime I also fell to one side and my husband to another.
    <br>But when we stood up, she said something very interesting.
    <br>She said, "Mummy, someone pulled me down. I didn't fall".
    <br>I said, "No. Even the man of God didn't touch you.
    <br>He just waved his hand and you fell on your own.
    <br>And that was it".
    <br>There was a time we came and there was an all night prayer here.
    <br>That Friday she vomitted.
    <br>She used to have a nose ring and it popped out.
    <br>Maybe those were signs that her body was not clean.
    <br>There were a lot of things that weren't supposed to be there. I don't know.
    <br>We took it lighty and thought it was deliverance and we went home.
    <br>I'm so glad and grateful to God as God has been kind to us.
    <br>One by one He is dealing with us as a family.
    <br>Amen. Put your hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Hon. Dr Ruth Labode & Daughter - Deliverance testimony
    <br>Thank you, mama. Thank you for that wonderful word of advice to parents.
    <br>We would like to listen to your word of advice now as a youth.
    <br>Please, we want you to address the youth all over the world
    <br>concerning this smoking, drinking and other forms of addiction
    <br>that actually tarnish the future of the youth today and thank God you are delivered from it.
    <br>So what do you want to tell them?
    <br>Emmanuel to all the youth all over the world!
    <br>First of all, I want to encourage you to know and understand your Bible.
    <br>Seek first the Kingdom of God and then everything else will follow.
    <br>Do not surround yourself with people who are of the world.
    <br>I started smoking becase I was imitating my friends who were smokers
    <br>but I ended up overtaking them, smoking more cigarettes than they were.
    <br>You need to surround yourself with people of God - people of the same mission.
    <br>Listen to your parents.
    <br>When you go to church, don't go because you have to go.
    <br>Find it in your heart, pray to God and ask Him to open up your heart and make you have hunger for His Word.
    <br>Ask God to show Himself to you.
    <br>Ask Him to make you understand. The Holy Spirit should guide you and be your teacher.
    <br>It's important.
    <br>For me, it was my environment, the people around me.
    <br>At university, there were people who were Christians. But to me, they were boring.
    <br>In the world it is not all about being liked by other people.
    <br>It is about doing what is right for God.
    <br>That is what you need to do. Because eventually you are going to hear about God.
    <br>Eventually you are going to know and realise that what you are doing is bad.
    <br>So there is no point wasting years, money or time on things that will just kill you faster
    <br>because God has given us the gift of life.
    <br>If you walk the path of righteousness, you have a longer life.
    <br>If you walk the path of sin, your days are numbered.
    <br>So to all the youth - it is not worth it.
    <br>Listen to your parents, come back to God
    <br>and surround yourself with good people.
    <br>The Bible is your key, your guide, your map and everything.
    <br>You should know your Bible, understand it and do what the Bible says. Don't just read it and be a pharisee.
    <br>Do what the Bible says - that is the main thing. Thank you.
    <br>Thank you very much. Let's clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Miss Titilola Labode & Mother - Deliverance Testimony
    <br>Thank you for that wonderful word of advice to the youth all over the world.
    <br>That is a food for thoughts because the Bible says that bad friends are epidemics.
    <br>Wayward friends are epidemics.
    <br>Bad companies corrupt good manners.
    <br>So wherever we find ourselves - on the campus, at work, school, anywhere -
    <br>we must not be too quick to trust
    <br>and we must not follow bad companies that will lead us to a wayward life.
    <br>And now that you have been set free, remember that Jesus Christ has delivered you
    <br>so that you might follow Him.
    <br>We now want to encourage you to make the Word of God the standard for your life
    <br>and as you do so, the blessings of God Almighty will continue to unfold in your life
    <br>and your future is guaranteed in Jesus' name!
    <br>Amen. Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Thank you.
