  <p>    
    <br>Let us love...
    <br>...one another...
    <br>...irrespective of our race or religion...
    <br>for love comes from God.
    <br>Love has a language...
    <br>...that transcends all languages,...
    <br>all barriers, all distances.
    <br>Love has ears to hear the heart.
    <br>The more you love God...
    <br>...the more you love your neighbour.
    <br>It is more blessed...
    <br>...to give than to receive.
    <br>EMMANUEL TV OUTREACH IN PAKISTAN DURING LOCKDOWN
    <br>Emmanuel! We are here in Shield of Faith Church, Lahore, Pakistan
    <br>on behalf of the man of God, T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners.
    <br>We thank God for His love and grace.
    <br>In the lockdown situation around the world, people are inside their homes
    <br>and mostly have no food to eat, and are living from hand to mouth.
    <br>During this difficult time, the man of God, T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>sent help for the needy - some food items:
    <br>flour, sugar, salt, red chilli, grains, beans, lentils, tea, milk, pickles, spices and rice.
    <br>Because of the virus, there is need for social distancing within the Emmanuel TVTeam.
    <br>The Emmanuel TV Team will pack bags to take to the needy's doorsteps.
    <br>We are thankful to the man of God, T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV Partners for their love.
    <br>From Emmanuel School and Shield of Faith Church, Lahore, Pakistan, thank you.

    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>Greetings in Jesus Christ's name.
    <br>As you know, all over the world, there is virus
    <br>and Pakistan is also affected by this virus.
    <br>Because of the virus, we were staying at our home for 14 or 15 days
    <br>and we were not able to buy food.
    <br>But we are very thankful for Emmanuel TV and the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>who sent us these things to Pakistan.
    <br>They sent us flour, lentils, grains, cooking oil, sugar, salt, rice, pickles and many other things.
    <br>From the bottom of my heart, I am thankful to the Emmanuel TV Partners
    <br>who stand with us in this difficult time and saved us from death.
    <br>If we didn't have this food, maybe we would die.
    <br>But thank God for the Emmanuel TV Partners who sent us this stuff -
    <br>the food and materials that we can live on.
