  <p>    
    <br>Good morning!
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us – Matthew 1:23)
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>As the Spirit directs...
    <br>You may be seated.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>God talks to us through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>So, where is the Word of God?
    <br>Let me see it in your hand - your Bible.
    <br>Tell your neighbour, "God talks to us through His Word by His Spirit".
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>[Amen.]
    <br>Today we talk about the work of faith.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>We talk about the work of faith to point you to the Lord.
    <br>You cannot please Him without faith.
    <br>Hallelujah!
    <br>The book of 2 Corinthians.
    <br>I will take my reading from chapter 5.
    <br>Awaiting the New Body
    <br>That means this body is a tent.
    <br>The body you are in is a tent.
    <br>Chapter 5: "For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God,"
    <br>I take it again:
    <br>"For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God,
    <br>an eternal house in Heaven, not built by human hands.”
    <br>Human hands are not employed.
    <br>Let's take a look at verse 7.
    <br>“For we live by faith, not by sight.
    <br>We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
    <br>[So we make it our goal to please him], whether we are at home in the body or away from it."
    <br>Verse 10:
    <br>“For we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ,
    <br>so that each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad."
    <br>THE WORK OF FAITH
    <br>Today, we see the work of faith as a risk.
    <br>Christians today see the work of faith as a risk.
    <br>How can I believe what I can’t see with my eyes?
    <br>The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act.
    <br>How can I believe what I do not see?
    <br>We are used to what we see and feel; what you can see by yourself, perceive and feel.
    <br>These are things we are used to.
    <br>But for me now to begin to believe in what I do not see...
    <br>We see it as a risk.
    <br>The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act.
    <br>If a person has not received the teaching of the Scriptures,
    <br>if you have not been grounded in the Word
    <br>or you have not received the promise of the Holy Spirit in your spirit,
    <br>forcing yourself to do such acts is indeed a risk.
    <br>You must be grounded in the Word.
    <br>If you have not been grounded in the Word of God,
    <br>there will be nothing in your heart for the Spirit of God to use or remind you of.
    <br>One would be empty; the heart would be empty.
    <br>Heart means spirit.
    <br>When the heart is empty, there is nothing for the Spirit to use.
    <br>It is not all up to you, certainly, it is not all up to Him;
    <br>your genuineness plus His ability makes it happen.
    <br>If you are empty, there is nothing for Him to use.
    <br>You must be grounded in the Word.
    <br>He uses The Word in our heart.
    <br>This is why we give you the "faith bracelet" to meditate.
    <br>Meditation in the Word of God is a visit with God.
    <br>If a person has not received the teaching of the Scriptures,
    <br>if you have not been grounded in the Word of God
    <br>or you have not received the promise of the Holy Spirit in your heart,
    <br>forcing yourself to do such acts – be healed, be delivered, be saved, in Jesus’ name - is indeed a risk.
    <br>Anything that comes by force is not faith.
    <br>Force...
    <br>Effortless.
    <br>If your work of faith is conscious and pretentious, you have not yet learned the lesson of faith.
    <br>If you have faith in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    <br>these acts are spontaneous and unpretentious – natural, without sweat.
    <br>Be healed, be delivered - you are not the one doing this, it is God.
    <br>The work of healing is not our work.
    <br>Healing - it is not our work.
    <br>Deliverance - it is not our work.
    <br>It is God's work.
    <br>When it comes to healing, it is not me.
    <br>That is why I can heal you and at the same time give you money because I know that healing is not my work.
    <br>Giving you money is a way of receiving a blessing because that healing is not my work.
    <br>If I go ahead and give you money to help you, bless you as well, it is a way of receiving a blessing from God.
    <br>I cannot say that I healed; I am not the one who is healing.
    <br>Don't be surprised if a man of God prays for you and heals you, and at the same time gives you money.
    <br>What? 
    <br>You give me money after my healing?
    <br>No, don't be surprised because that healing is not his work.
    <br>He is just being used as a "material".
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Don't be surprised if man of God prays for you and heals you...
    <br>"I am healed" - "You have to pay"
    <br>No!
    <br>That healing is not his job or work - it is God's work.
    <br>If he heals you and gives you money, don't be surprised - he himself is also looking for a blessing.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is a way of paying his tithes.
    <br>If you have faith in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ...
    <br>There are many faiths: faith in faith, faith in yourself, faith in a business.
    <br>One might say, "I have faith in that job".
    <br>That is not the kind of faith we are talking about here.
    <br>The kind of faith we are talking about here is a trust.
    <br>Faith means a trust.
    <br>T R U S T
    <br>Don’t try to trust anyone.
    <br>Just love everyone; trust only God.
    <br>Don’t trust me, just love me.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You can only trust Someone who has no beginning and has no end.
    <br>I have a beginning and an end.
    <br>Only Jesus has no beginning and has no end – trust Him.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If you have faith in the finished work of our Lord Jesus Christ, that is "by His stripes"...
    <br>All what we are looking for - blessing, victories, salvation, or whatever - they are all past issues.
    <br>The healing, victory, deliverance - they are past, on the cross.
    <br>All the way to Calvary
    <br>He went for me
    <br>He went to set me free
    <br>They are all past events.
    <br>You have no reason to be sick, to suffer.
    <br>In Him there is nothing like that.
    <br>If you have faith in that - that is what I call "finished work"...
    <br>If you now have faith in the finished works, these acts are spontaneous and unpretentious - that is natural.
    <br>"Be healed!" - it is natural.
    <br>It will flow just like that.
    <br>You will not be conscious.
    <br>You will be under the influence of God.
    <br>When people are under the influence of wine; this is where you want to go, isn't it?
    <br>This is where you want to go, isn't it?
    <br>Why can't you go where you want to go?
    <br>Because you are under what? - Influence.
    <br>Are you conscious?
    <br>[No.]
    <br>Oh yes!
    <br>If your work of faith is something conscious, you have not yet learned the lesson of faith.
    <br>If you are conscious, you will be looking for members of your family to heal them.
    <br>You will not pray for your enemies.
    <br>"You will see today!"
    <br>"Be healed!"
    <br>Auntie, come; let me heal you so that you can go and rest.
    <br>Because she is my family, because I am conscious of...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>And we are not here for that now.
    <br>Just as if someone is under the influence of wine.
    <br>When you take "kaka kaka kaka" - how do you call it?
    <br>Real "uguguru".
    <br>We are not seeing the 'mother one' today.
    <br>You can finish ten bottles.
    <br>The real one, the local one in those days - just a spoon...
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>It is where I want to go, isn't it?
    <br>Why I couldn't go there?
    <br>Because I am what? - Under the influence.
    <br>Under what? - Influence.
    <br>And I am not what?
    <br>- I am not conscious of what I am doing.
    <br>If I were conscious of what I was doing, I would not be going the way I am going
    <br>because I am not conscious.
    <br>If your work of faith is something conscious, you will be looking for your family to pray for them first.
    <br>You will not pray for your enemy.
    <br>If your enemy comes for prayer, you will say, "Please, go.
    <br>You have forgotten what you have done".
    <br>This is what happens today.
    <br>We are conscious of ourselves when we are praying.
    <br>So, if your work of faith is something conscious and pretentious, you have not learned the lesson of faith.
    <br>When you are to pray: "It is 4 o'clock, hello, please, I will call you back" - you want to pray -
    <br>you are conscious of what you are doing.
    <br>Prayer is not your work.
    <br>Or, "Prayer is the key, prayer is the key" - you are praying in your room.
    <br>Somebody knocks on the door - you say, "Wait for me! Let me go and open the door. We are praying.
    <br>Come and join us" - you are conscious of what you are doing.
    <br>Prayer is not yours.
    <br>When you are praying, you don't know you are taken from this tent.
    <br>You are no longer in this tent.
    <br>See, my brother has this handset when he prays.
    <br>If there is any phone call, he stops the prayer and...
    <br>And does what?
    <br>Off it - it means you are conscious of what you are doing.
    <br>When you are conscious of what you are doing,
    <br>it means you are using your reasoning, mental power to pray, not the Spirit of God.
    <br>You say, "At 3 o'clock, I will break my fast".
    <br>How do you know when you will break your fast?
    <br>Exactly at 3 o'clock, whatever you will be doing, you will stop it.
    <br>You want to break your fasting.
    <br>You are conscious of what you are doing.
    <br>Reasoning, mental power...
    <br>What is the result of this?
    <br>If you have faith on these, what will happen is that after prayer,
    <br>you will still be worried and full of anxiety as if you have never prayed at all
    <br>because your faith is not on the finished works of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
    <br>Anytime you have that, you will know - this is what the man of God was saying.
    <br>You can know.
    <br>If the work of your faith is something conscious, after prayer,
    <br>you will still be worried and full of anxiety as if you have never prayed at all.
    <br>This shows there is no evidence of faith.
    <br>Anytime God gives us faith, He gives us evidence of the faith.
    <br>Evidence of the faith is – after prayer, joy.
    <br>Prayer for any request must be followed by an absolute trust in God that He is now working out the answer.
    <br>Anytime God gives us faith, He gives us evidence of the faith.
    <br>What is the evidence of faith?
    <br>Evidence of faith is an absolute trust after prayer.
    <br>"In Jesus' name, amen!" - now, an absolute trust in Him that He is working out the answer.
    <br>Let me tell you - faith does not rely on itself; God is the place where faith rests.
    <br>Only those who have such rest have faith.
    <br>What is rest?
    <br>Rest in God's love, wisdom and power.
    <br>He gives us faith and He gives us evidence of the faith.
    <br>No matter what you think, feel or do – what God has said is final.
    <br>No matter what you feel of think, "This should be this way or that way..."
    <br>What you think or feel...
    <br>What matters is what God has said; He speaks to us through His Word by His Spirit.
    <br>The Holy Spirit intercedes for us.
    <br>We don’t know how to pray.
    <br>Do you know that?
    <br>The Holy Spirit intercedes for us.
    <br>We don't know how to pray.
    <br>If the Holy Spirit is the One interceding for us because we do not know how to pray,
    <br>how can you be conscious of what you are saying?
    <br>He is the One who will take you out of this tent when you are praying of Him.
    <br>Acts of faith are but acts of self-surrender.
    <br>What do I mean?
    <br>I mean, putting an absolute stop to your own work, way, thinking, reasoning
    <br>and to rest in God's love, wisdom and power.
    <br>Putting an absolute stop to your own work, way, thinking, reasoning.
    <br>And you want to be...
    <br>99% of Christians today - this is our problem.
    <br>We have prayer points - it is consciousness.
    <br>When I was very little, there was a pastor who used to come to my mum, my late mum.
    <br>In those days I was in primary school.
    <br>Each time I saw this pastor, I complained, "Oh, this man has come again."
    <br>Because we would be on our knees for 5 hours.
    <br>Whenever I saw the pastor coming, I would say, "Oh my God".
    <br>Sometimes I would even hide myself.
    <br>Each prayer point - 30 minutes.
    <br>We would be on our knees.
    <br>"Prayer for pardon!"
    <br>I would finish my own in less than 2 minutes.
    <br>I would open my eyes and look around.
    <br>I would be looking at everybody who was praying.
    <br>They would continue to pray.
    <br>There was a time I approached my mum on my knees and I drew my mum's attire.
    <br>The attire fell on the ground.
    <br>Mummy opened her eyes and said, "Do you want to undress me?"
    <br>Indeed, the attire just fell down.
    <br>My mum opened her eyes - I said, "Aha, my mum is conscious of what she is doing".
    <br>Momma drew back and hit me.
    <br>The pastor opened his eyes and said "What happened?
    <br>Aha, these people were not calling God.
    <br>You people are fighting in the presence of God - it is not God, God is not there".
    <br>The pastor said, "Take it easy. Prayer for mercy again".
    <br>He started again.
    <br>I was looking for something to stop it.
    <br>My mummy drew her attire, tied it back and she hit me.
    <br>After the prayer she came and said, "You have been very stubborn. What are you doing this for?"
    <br>I said, "How can we be using 5 hours on our knees?"
    <br>Like I have said,
    <br>anything that comes by force is not faith.
    <br>Like, what we have seen now.
    <br>Acts of faith are but acts of self-surrender.
    <br>Let someone say, "Anything that comes by force is not faith."
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Faith is something that comes spontaneously.
    <br>Let someone say it.
    <br>"Faith is something that comes spontaneously."
    <br>Look at my brother.
    <br>Can you see?
    <br>You see my brother?
    <br>I can see you.
    <br>You can see me, yes.
    <br>OK.
    <br>Do I need now to force myself to believe that you are the one...
    <br>No.
    <br>and begin to do like this?
    <br>No.
    <br>Not at all.
    <br>No, no, no.
    <br>That is faith.
    <br>Within a second, I believe - that is faith.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>Within a second I believe, it is a man.
    <br>I do not need to force myself or struggle to believe.
    <br>This is what you people are doing today.
    <br>This is what you are doing.
    <br>Struggle to believe, "Is it the one? Or is it any other person? Who is the man?"
    <br>Whereas this is the man.
    <br>I can see you are the one.
    <br>I don't need to force myself to believe, or struggle to believe.
    <br>That is faith for you.
    <br>Say after me, "Acts of faith are but of self-surrender."
    <br>Again.
    <br>[Acts of faith are but of self-surrender.]
    <br>Putting an absolute stop to your own way, doing, looking, work
    <br>and rest in God's love, wisdom, power – that is faith.
    <br>You may be seated, thank you.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>You must be under the influence of God to do the will of God.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>If I want to do what this man wants me to do, I must be under your influence.
    <br>OK, what do you want me to do?
    <br>You want me to go there and you want me to follow you?
    <br>Let's go.
    <br>I must be under his influence to follow him, where he wants to go
    <br>because where he wants to go is not where I want to go.
    <br>I want to go a different way and he wants to go this way.
    <br>Before I surrender, I must be under his influence.
    <br>OK, let's go.
    <br>Now, it means that out of faith,
    <br>out of self-surrender,
    <br>I have surrendered to this man.
    <br>The SCOAN Sunday Service
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>All to Thee
    <br>My blessed Saviour
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>Unto Jesus I surrender all
    <br>All to Jesus I surrender
    <br>All to Him I freely give
    <br>I will ever live and trust Him
    <br>In His presence daily live
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>All to Thee
    <br>My blessed Saviour
    <br>I surrender all
    <br>Acts of faith are but acts of self-surrender.
    <br>Putting an absolute stop to our own way, work, thinking, thoughts
    <br>and rest in God's love, wisdom and power.
