  <p>    
    <br>Brother, how are you?
    <br>Fine, sir.
    <br>God wants to use you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>But it was very bad in the past - you had bad friends.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>When I say bad friends, I mean internet scammers.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You just need to be delivered.
    <br>It is true you have accepted God but nodoby has actually delivered you.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>And those spirits are tormenting you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>You are being tortured because your past is torturing you.
    <br>Yes.
    <br>Prophecy Time
    <br>I will pray with you.
    <br>Amen.
    <br>And after praying with you, I am seeing you at the embassy.
    <br>I have my passport here.
    <br>- To go to the embassy?
    <br>- Yes.
    <br>Clap for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Even my case from the Appeal Court in London is here. I won the appeal; they refuse to call me.
    <br>I said after the deliverance, I am seeing you at the embassy obtaining a visa.
    <br>He has the document in the bag. What a God we serve.
    <br>What a God we serve!
    <br>What a Son we worship!
    <br>What future hope!
    <br>That is God for you.
    <br>If what you are saying is according to God's Spirit, you will be precise and true.
    <br>Your words will not be wasted.
    <br>You will not continue to say stories but be precise.
    <br>So, brother, after your deliverance, wait for me.
    <br>Like I have said, I am seeing you ---
    <br>Thank you, Man of God.
    <br>This is the third time you have been to the embassy and they have been rejecting you.
    <br>Yes, Man of God.
    <br>Deliverance In Jesus' Name
    <br>Thank You, Lord. You are free.
    <br>Set Free In Jesus' Name
    <br>TESTIMONY TIME
    <br>Praise the Lord, Church!
    <br>My name is Joseph Imarhiagbe.
    <br>This is my lovely wife, Celine Imarhiagbe.
    <br>We are from the UK.
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Nigerians Living In The UK
    <br>Before I start, let me just give a song to my Jesus.
    <br>I never knew He would answer me this way
    <br>Answer me this way
    <br>Thank You Jesus
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Nigerians Living In The UK
    <br>I was facing challenges in the UK to have my residence over there.
    <br>All proved abortive - I couldn't.
    <br>My wife and I tried so many ways. We spent so much money but nothing happened.
    <br>Eventually, I was removed from the UK.
    <br>Rather, I was deported from the United Kingdom.
    <br>If you get deported from the United Kingdom,
    <br>you have to wait a particular number of years before you can apply again.
    <br>I was moving with friends - bad friends.
    <br>Internet scamming friends.
    <br>We were thinking of getting rich quickly.
    <br>Trying to make ends meet but nothing came out of it.
    <br>I was in the UK, trying to settle down but I couldn't get my residence permit.
    <br>Eventually, my visa ran out and I was deported to Nigeria.
    <br>Then, we were watching Emmanuel TV on YouTube.
    <br>A friend of mine in France - my wife's friend - said, "You have to go to The SCOAN!
    <br>Your blessing is there!"
    <br>I said, "Ok".
    <br>I came to Nigeria.
    <br>Thank God!
    <br>On the 19th of April, God Almighty, God of the Prophet, God of Prophet T.B. Joshua located me!
    <br>And he said, "God wants to use you and you have so many bad friends".
    <br>Actually, there are so many bad friends.
    <br>I was moving with different friends - these internet scamming friends.
    <br>But thank God!
    <br>And he gave another prophecy that he is seeing me going to the embassy,
    <br>collecting my visa.
    <br>Immediately he mentioned that word, that fear left me.
    <br>That fear - "how am I going to get this visa?" - left me immediately.
    <br>Praise the Lord!
    <br>I went to the embassy and applied.
    <br>I was given an European family member permit to travel back to the UK after the prophecy.
    <br>Just two weeks after the prophecy!
    <br>Shall we put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>When you hear the mightiness and goodness of God in the lives of the people,
    <br>you shall give Him a bigger hands of applause!
    <br>This is just a miracle!
    <br>And nobody else could have justly done this than our Lord and Saviour!
    <br>If you know that, put your hands together louder for Jesus!
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Immediately the man of God prophesied to me, the fear left.
    <br>And I was having this spirit of boldness to go to the embassy and apply for a visa.
    <br>How long would you have had to stay
    <br>before you could ever apply for another visa to the UK?
    <br>10 years!
    <br>But after you received those words of prophecy from the man of God,
    <br>immediately you got to The SCOAN, tell us how long it took you to get your visa.
    <br>It was just two weeks.
    <br>Two weeks compared to ten years - isn't that a miracle!
    <br>Put your hands together once again for Jesus!
    <br>Louder for Jesus!
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>After I got the visa, I went to the UK.
    <br>At Heathrow airport, I was stopped by the UK border agency
    <br>that I was not the person on my passport.
    <br>I said, "Wow. How can you say so?" I brought everything out.
    <br>He said, "No, you are not the person".
    <br>I was arrested at Heathrow airport.
    <br>I brought out my Morning Water.
    <br>I was ministering the Morning Water in my pocket, calling the name of Jesus.
    <br>I said, "Father, you have used your servant to prophesy about my life,
    <br>for me to get this visa. Father, I don't want to go back to Nigeria again.
    <br>Father, help me out!"
    <br>I was spraying the Morning Water on my pocket.
    <br>Just ten minutes later, the same person came in
    <br>and said, "Mr Joseph, please, we are sorry.
    <br>On behalf of the UK border agency, have your visa".
    <br>It was stamped and I went straight to meet my wife.
    <br>I was so happy.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus.
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>This is the prophecy the man of God gave that I had been rejected three times.
    <br>This is one and two.
    <br>This is another stamp.
    <br>After the prophecy was given, can you now show us the confirmation of that word of prophecy.
    <br>After the prophecy, I was given my residence permit.
    <br>This is my residence permit in the UK.
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>As we know that seeing only what God says will produce and increase our faith.
    <br>We have seen the proof of the words of prophecy given by the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, to this brother
    <br>and we have seen the proof on his passport, that is the permit that he was given in the UK.
    <br>Can you show us other documents to proof what God has done in your life,
    <br>immediately you received those words of prophecy.
    <br>Thank you.
    <br>As you can see here - here is the certificate of application
    <br>after the man of God had prophesied upon my life.
    <br>This certificate of application came with the residence document.
    <br>Here was the case, the appeal in the United Kingdom that I won.
    <br>It stated that the Secretary of State did not have the right to remove me from the United Kingdom.
    <br>Here is also the same document to confirm my stay in the UK.
    <br>I thank God - this is our family car.
    <br>God has blessed us with this and we return all the glory to God.
    <br>Hallelujah. Shall we once again put our hands together for Jesus!
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So can you tell us - how has your life been since you received the residence permit in the UK,
    <br>compared to your life before?
    <br>As you can see me now, I am shining in the Lord.
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>If you can play the video back, I was dark.
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>But Jesus has taken control.
    <br>Thank You, Lord.
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>So we can see on the screen of our television as the brother rightly said,
    <br>before he received that prophecy that transformed his life,
    <br>we can see him looking - you can know that something is amiss,
    <br>that something is definitely wrong with the posture we are seeing.
    <br>But look at the picture you are seeing on the right-hand side -
    <br>you can know that God Almighty has done something miraculous in his life.
    <br>He said, immediately he received that prophecy, his whole life was totally transformed.
    <br>The life of his wife was totally transformed.
    <br>He is now living fine. He now has a job of his own.
    <br>We can see the car God Almighty has blessed them with,
    <br>and they have a good life now to the glory of God.
    <br>Let us once again put our hands together for Jesus Christ!
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>Emmanuel!
    <br>(God With Us - Matthew 1:23)
    <br>My name is Celine Imarhiagbe.
    <br>The man standing by my side is my husband.
    <br>My husband has said it all.
    <br>We really thank God for our lives, what God has done for us.
    <br>We praise God, in Jesus' name.
    <br>Mrs Celine Imarhiagbe & Husband 
    <br>Prophecy Testimony
    <br>My word of advice: Don't run to friends, run to Jesus!
    <br>Hallelujah. That was short, brief but straight to the point.
    <br>That whatever situation we may be passing through in life, we must trust in God
    <br>that only Him can see you through.
    <br>We give glory to God Almighty for what He has done in your life and the life of your family.
    <br>You should know that all this is for the salvation of your soul.
    <br>Make sure you hold on to God's word.
    <br>Make His word the standard for your life
    <br>and as you know His Word, it will continue to set you on that good road to the good life.
    <br>Hallelujah. Once again, let us put our hands together for Jesus Christ.
    <br>Mr Joseph Imarhiagbe & Wife
