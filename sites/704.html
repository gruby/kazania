  <p>    
    <br>Can I talk to you, brother?
    <br>Where is your mum?
    <br>She is at home.
    <br>Take care of your mum.
    <br>Okay?
    <br>Okay.
    <br>Take care of your mum.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>Your mum is a good woman.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>I don't know why they call her all (kinds of) names.
    <br>They called her a witch. There is nothing they have not called this woman.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>Thank You, Jesus!
    <br>Why do you people believe this woman is a witch?
    <br>That is what the people are calling her.
    <br>Even my dad's family, all of them call her a witch.
    <br>That is my family on my father's side - they called my mother a witch.
    <br>This is the problem you people have, calling an innocent person - 'a nature of God' -
    <br>someone who is not a witch, witch.
    <br>This woman has cried and cried.
    <br>Exactly, sir.
    <br>None of you will prosper unless this woman accepts 'sorry'
    <br>and the Spirit of God forgives you.
    <br>This woman suffered.
    <br>You are going to bring this woman.
    <br>Okay? Go and wait for me.
    <br>Thank you, sir.
    <br>It will not only be you.
    <br>We will beg mama with the Spirit of God and she will accept.
    <br>All of the family will be delivered.
    <br>They have cursed this woman.
    <br>Because of that, she is living at the backyard of the house.
    <br>Yes, sir.
    <br>My name is Charles Benson.
    <br>I'm from Delta State.
    <br>The woman standing beside me is my mother whom we called a witch.
    <br>These people behind me are my brothers and sisters.
    <br>This other mama here is my mother-in-law.
    <br>Last Sunday, when we were in the first service, the man of God called me.
    <br>He asked me where my mother was.
    <br>I said that my mother was at home.
    <br>He then said that I should take care of her.
    <br>I said, "Okay, sir".
    <br>After that, he prophesied to me.
    <br>He asked, "Why do they call your mother all sorts of names?"
    <br>"They call her a witch. She is not a witch; she is innocent."
    <br>He said that even I called her a witch.
    <br>He said that because of that, she cried.
    <br>Because of her crying, there is no breakthrough in the family.
    <br>So, he said I should bring her here.
    <br>That is why I brought her here with my family.
    <br>What the man of God said is true.
    <br>We called her a witch and put her at the backyard.
    <br>My name is Fatima.
    <br>When my husband died, the family called me to their meeting.
    <br>They asked me what happened.
    <br>I told them that I didn't know what killed their brother.
    <br>They said that I was the one that killed my husband.
    <br>I said that I didn't know anything concerning that,
    <br>that he was sick.
    <br>After we came from the village,
    <br>the house that my children, my husband and I were staying in,
    <br>my husband's family drove me out.
    <br>I begged that they should let me and my children stay.
    <br>They said that they had already shared the house and given it to someone else.
    <br>They threw my property outside and drove me away.
    <br>I had nowhere to stay and even to eat was difficult.
    <br>This mama saw me suffering when all my property was outside.
    <br>She met me and said she couldn't leave me like that.
    <br>She took some of the property and took it to the backyard where she used to work.
    <br>It was a backyard, outside.
    <br>They gave me money to live and cook.
    <br>We quite understand what has happened to you - the pain.
    <br>That was why we invited you here today
    <br>to let the world know that you are not a witch
    <br>and that we are very sorry for what happened.
    <br>This is a glorious day for every one of us.
    <br>We are very sorry; mama is not a witch.
    <br>Son, please be on your knee and hug your mum.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>So, please, mama, pray for them.
    <br>Mama is praying for them.
    <br>So, please, as you are offering this prayer, the Lord Almighty is praying for them as well.
    <br>They are looking for breakthrough
    <br>and they don't know the sin they have committed, ignorantly.
    <br>Now, mama has forgiven them.
    <br>Mama, you should forgive everyone.
    <br>All these are my husband's family.
    <br>The last son threw my things away.
    <br>So, you threw away mama's things?
    <br>It was due to permission from the home, sir.
    <br>He needs prayer.
    <br>He needs prayer because he didn't know what he was doing.
    <br>He threw all my property away.
    <br>He is the one that threw your property away?
    <br>Yes.
    <br>That was the order from the home.
    <br>That was why mama said you need prayer.
    <br>Mama knows that you acted ignorantly.
    <br>Prophecy Confirmation
    <br>She said that they drove this woman outside.
    <br>She was the one taking care of her.
    <br>Nobody from the family asked about her or the children,
    <br>how they were feeding and how they were doing.
    <br>So, it is over now. We thank God.
    <br>God is the one who gave us this revelation
    <br>and the same God is saying, "It is over".
    <br>Man of God, I forgive all the people who made me suffer.
